" We are well into the morn of the day when long lines should not be regulated at all .... Long distance should be put over on the competitive pile . The local loops would be on the other . " 32 Others in the Reagan administration , most importantly the Defense Department , rejected any breakup of the Bell system because of its potentially adverse impact on defense procurement and for other reasons . In addition , Congress was actively considering telecommunications legislation that would reshape the industry . At the same time , the F.C.C. and the Justice Department were involved in judicial proceedings concerning proposed modifications of the 1956 Western Electric consent decree . The AT &T; case , in a phrase , was becoming a political football over which the parties to the case were losing control . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on December 16 , 1981 , Chief Executive Officer Charles Brown scrapped his prepared statement and instead described the Baxter divestiture plan that had been under discussion between Baxter and AT &T; general counsel Howard Trienens . After Brown had been thoroughly questioned by the others present , the board authorized him to enter divestiture talks with the Justice Department . Baxter and his staff began preparing an agreement based on regulated and unregulated divisions of the company . Baxter did not care whether AT &T; kept the local operating companies or the competitive parts of the business , as long as it did not keep both . AT &T; received a first draft of the proposed consent decree on December 21 . After Brown reviewed the original proposal , a modified proposed decree little different from the first one was prepared . At most , half a dozen Justice Department employees , AT &T's; directors , and perhaps ten of its employees knew of the momentous events that were taking place . As the agreement took shape , the lawyers turned their attention to the legal vehicle that was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT &T; wanted to eliminate the restrictions in the 1956 consent decree . Both sides wanted to consolidate the New Jersey and District of Columbia cases before one judge ? Judge Greene . Therefore , they concluded that the agreement should be a modification of the 1956 consent decree . Judge Biunno was asked to transfer the matter to Judge Greene 's court but not to examine the substance of the agreement . Little known is that Judge Biunno did , in fact , approve the decree before transferring it to Judge Greene , who conducted his own review . Further , both sides argued that the Tunney Act did not apply to modifications of decrees but , expecting to lose on that issue , they followed the Tunney Act procedures . // At the heart of the settlement was the requirement that AT &T; would spin off the BelI operating companies and submit a plan that would restructure the BOCs into viable entities . AT &T; would no longer be in the local-exchange business ( except for its minority ownership in Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &T; would retain control of Bell Labs and Western Electric and continue to operate its intercity long-distance network . The company would furnish all CPE , including that provided by the local Bell companies , but license and supply contracts then in effect between Western Electric and the local operating companies would be canceled . The new operating companies would , thus , be free to choose their own suppliers . Because the local operating companies would be suddenly divorced from Bell Labs ? their principal resource for scientific and technological information and research ? AT &T; agreed to provide the new operating companies , on a priority basis , with research , development , and support services until September 1987 . Finally , AT &T; promised that it would not acquire the stock of any spun-off Bell operating company . The settlement also specified the obligations of the new Bell operating companies . Foremost among these was to provide each long-distance carrier and information-service provider ( that is , a company that transforms and communicates information ) access into local loops equal in type , quality , and price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if a person dialed " 1 " to access AT &T's; long-distance service , each new Bell operating company would have to make arrangements to treat the other long-distance carriers equally . The new operating companies would offer their customers a choice of which long-distance carrier they wanted that would be accessed by dialing " 1 . " Similarly , each BOC was forbidden to discriminate in treatment between AT &T; and other suppliers of various services , CPE , and switching and transmission equipment . However , the most controversial aspects of the settlement followed from Baxter 's rigorous distinction between regulated and unregulated businesses . The new operating companies ( with a few exceptions relating to emergencies ) were forbidden to manufacture or distribute CPE or other telecommunications products . For the same reason , they were excluded from the interexchange long-distance and information-service businesses . More generally , the BOCs were expected not to provide any other product or service , except local telephone service and local access , " that is not a natural monopoly service actually regulated by tariff . " 33 Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties to the settlement formed a united front once they entered into the agreement , virtually every other interest criticized some // aspect of it . These criticisms were quite varied ; for example , some deplored the breakup while others felt that the breakup did not go far enough . I he criticism continued in the formal comments authorized under the ' funney Act . More than six hundred individuals and organizations filed continents comprising approximately 8,750 pages . Both the Justice Department and AT &T; sought to complete the arrangements called for in the settlement as quickly as possible and to do so without undue shock to the component parts of the new system or subscribers . In February 1982 , AT &T; took the first step in reconstructing the twenty-two operating companies into more economically viable entities by reorganizing them into seven larger regional operation firms . In this way , smaller BOCs like Diamond State Telephone , which covered Delaware , would be better able to withstand the shock of divestiture . Each of the regional companies , which in fact constituted the firms eventually spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . GTE was then the second largest integrated telephone company . The new regional Bell operating companies ( RBOCs ) would become : On August 11 , 1982 , Judge Greene rendered his opinion and order agreeing to accept the Modification of Final Judgment subject to certain modifications that applied to both the new operating companies and AT &T.34; // First , RI3OCs would continue to provide the printed Yellow Pages . Second , they could lease or sell CPE to their customers but they could not manufacture them . In this way , Greene argued , they would not favor their manufacturing subsidiaries ? thus solving the vertical integration problem . Third , the new RBOCs could enter other business markets if they were able to show that monopoly power would not be used to impede competition in the markets . Under this provision Judge Greene had been deluged by the operating companies with requests to enter new lines of business . Fourth , while the new RBOCs were prohibited from offering information and enhanced services , AT &T; was precluded from engaging in electronic publishing over its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deviations from the rigorous division into competitive and regulated activities that Baxter had devised . Further , they reveal Greene 's concern that without such opportunities and benefits , the RBOCs might not have become viable entities . Apparently concerned also about the possible adverse impact of the decree on the universal service goal , Greene did not object to a subsidy flow from the long-distance user to the local subscriber . However , Greene would soon realize that he had not replaced the F.C.C. as a decision-making body and that the settlement would not resolve many of the controversies and problems within the industry . In December 1982 , the F.C.C. adopted its long-debated access-charge rule ( not to be confused with equal access ) , under which each local subscriber would be charged a flat fee to link into the toll network . The flat fee was intended to help local telephone companies avoid having to raise business subscriber rates . Traditionally , business rates had subsidized residential rates , but now the reduced costs of bypass technologies afforded more firms the opportunity to bypass local loops if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to eliminate the incentive to bypass by shifting charges to residential subscribers . Yet access charges would be only one of numerous controversies into which Judge Greene would be drawn as a result of his obligation to supervise the enforcement of the decree . Nevertheless , on August 24 , 1982 , when the Justice Department and AT &T; signed a revised agreement incorporating the changes that Greene required , they undoubtedly believed that the agreement would solve more problems than it would create . AT &T's; plan for reorganization would become effective within the eighteen months following the entry of the approved Modification of Final Judgment . The new operating companies were to have sufficient facilities , personnel , systems , and rights to technical information to allow them to provide good performance ? an obligation that AT &T; fulfilled in exemplary fashion . In December 1982 , AT &T; filed its 471-page Plan of Reorga104 HOW AMERICA GOT ON-LINE nization . Under the plan , the former twenty-two B ( ) Cs were reorgunl into the seven RBOCs . Approximately 75 percent of ' AT &T's; assets w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the confiners United States was divided into 161 geographical areas called Local Acce and Transport Areas , or LATAs . The LATAs were generally centered around a city or other identifiable community of interest , and each one marked the boundaries within which operating-company subsidiaries of the RBOCs could provide telephone service . Thus , an operating company could provide local service and intra-LATA long distance , but inter-LA I A long distance would be provided by AT &T; and the other long-distance carriers , such as MCI ( which argued that the LATAs were too large ) . For examples because one LATA in Ohio included Cleveland , Akron , and Lorain , a longdistance call from Cleveland to Akron would be handled by the Ohio Bell subsidiary of Ameritech , but a call from Cleveland to Columbus would be served by an interexchange carrier . Certain exceptions permitting RBOC 's to cross LATA lines ( such as the New York City ? suburban New Jersey corridor ) were allowed . The plan also required each new RBOC to provide all interexchange carriers equal access by September 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the seven RBOCs , AT &T; set up a central services organization called Bellcore , which the RBOCs jointly owned , Bellcore 's function was to provide the RBOCs and their subsidiaries with technical assistance , such as network planning , engineering , and software development . Patterned after Bell Labs , the new company would also provide consulting services and serve as a central contact point for coordinating the efforts of the RBOCs in meeting national security requirements . On July 8 , 1983 , Judge Greene issued a decision largely accepting the plan of reorganization but requiring certain changes . First , he expanded the patent-licensing powers of the RBOCs . Second , AT &T; would no longer he permitted to use the logo or name " Bell " ( except in the case of Bell Telephone Laboratories ) . According to Greene , the continued use of " Bell " by AT &T; would have caused such confusion that an Illinois Bell subscriber , for example , would have assumed that AT &T; " is the natural or official ' long distance company to be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operating Companies . " 35 Symbolically , though , Greene 's decision on this point was appropriate ? it marked the end of a long period in telecommunications history ( even if it did n't mark the end of controversy within the industry ) . In early August , AT &T,; with some reluctance , and the Justice Department agreed to Greene 's modifications of ' the reorganization plan . In November , AT &T; sent to its shareholders a prospectus detailing the stock distribution plan ( seven RBOC shares for every ten AT &T; shares held ) . And at midnight on the last day of 1983 , the // MI system that had been gradually constructed for more than a century broke up . We noted in Chapter 1 F.A . Hayek 's observations on the extraordinary difficulties in predicting changes in the marketplace . No field illustrates his Wisdom more than telecommunications . Contemporary giants like Intel Corporation and Microsoft Corporation were comparatively small firms in 1984 , while Netscape Communications was not even conceived then . All became major players in telecommunications a little more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in telecommunications long before 1984 , few , if any , saw the extraordinary ways in which the technologies would soon converge . Words and phrases like " Internet , " " World Wide Web , " and " Gopher , " which have become extremely important in telecommunications , were unknown in 1984 . Even before the breakup , cellular radio was introduced in October 1983 by an Ameritech subsidiary , but the growth of wireless services in the next decade and beyond was barely perceived . The RBOCs would themselves become involved in numerous businesses throughout the world . In addition , by 1997 the seven RBOCs would become five , as Bell Atlantic merged with Nynex , and Southwestern Bell ( now SBC Communications ) acquired Pacific Telesis . Events overtook the decree , which was largely abrogated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 . The AT &T; breakup was crucially important , nevertheless , in two respects : first , because it restructured the dominant player in telecommunications and , second , because it occurred on the eve of dramatic changes in telecommunications . 6 Internationalization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Bill Clinton signed the most important United States telecommunications statute enacted since the Communications Act of 1934 . Congress had worked for more than five years to enact a statute that would accommodate the various interests involved in telecommunications and would take into account the new realities of 1996 . Much had changed since the AT &T; breakup in 1984 ; indeed , many of the important companies in modern telecommunications had either not been born or were not involved in 1984 . Netscape and America Online , for example , were unknown in 1984 , while Microsoft at that time was concerned only with software development , not telecommunications . In 1984 most of the telephone systems in Western Europe and Asia were publicly owned monopolies . So strongly entrenched was the public-monopoly idea in telecommunications that it was contained in West Germany 's fundamental law . In 1984 , however , British Telecommunications ( known as BT ) was transformed into a public company and listed on the various stock exchanges . Since that seminal event , public telephone systems throughout the world are gradually being privatized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . These remarkable changes were as unthinkable as late as 1976 , just as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of European communism were then . But the world had changed dramatically in many respects since then . There is little question that one of the most important changes that has occurred , especially since the AT &T; breakup , is the creation of a global telecommunications infrastructure as both response to and cause of the creation of a global economy . One week after President Clinton signed the 106 // new telecommunications law , Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers , two of the largest Wall Street brokerage houses , stated that they expected approximately 20 percent of their future investment banking revenues to come from global telecommunications . ) The contrast with earlier periods is dramatic . In 1980 , while a number of telephone stocks ( principally American firms ) were traded on the world 's stock exchanges , AT &T; was overwhelmingly the dominant factor . Between 1986 and 1995 the value of the telecommunications sector had quadrupled , with more and more firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year . Every major telecommunications firm has been investing heavily in an international presence , either separately or through an alliance with other firms . AT &T,; for example , which derived little of its revenue from international sources before the 1984 breakup , expects to earn half of its revenue outside the United States before the year 2000.2 If one looks at cross-border telecommunications acquisitions , the number and value of such transactions has been accelerating rapidly since the crucial year of 1984 . For example , from 1985 to 1990 alone , the number of deals increased from five to sixty-seven , while their value jumped from $399 million to $16.5 billion.3 Three interrelated trends must be considered to appreciate the international importance of the U.S. telecommunications sector : foreign trade , foreign investment , and globalization . Modern telecommunications is a contributing cause of these trends . At the same time , the increasing internationalization of telecommunications is also an effect of the trends . Let us begin with the exports of goods and services ( measured in constant 1987 dollars ) . In 1994 the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross domestic product ( GDP ) ? more than 2.5 times the 1960 percentage . At the same time , imports constituted more than 14 percent of GDP in 1994 , more than three times the 1960 figure . If we look at just the goods-producing sectors of the U.S. economy , the changes that have occurred are even more dramatic . In 1994 exports of U.S. goods were 24 percent of the domestic output of goods . The comparable figures for 1960 and 1980 were 8 percent and 16 percent . Imported goods illustrated comparable trends . In 1960 approximately 9 percent of the goods consumed in the United States were imported . By 1994 that figure had grown to about 28 percent . Thus , the United States has become more dependent on exports and imports than at any time in the era following World War II.4 And the upward import and export trends give every evidence of continuing as the successfully enacted North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and the signing of the Uruguay Round world trade agreements attest . At the most obvious level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased demand for telecommunications services . All // other things being equal , business customers engaged in telecommunications activities in many countries would clearly prefer to purchase services from a single provider rather than from many because transaction costs will be lower . The fact that all other things are often not equal provides an incentive , in turn , for telecommunications providers to place themselves in the position of being a one-stop provider . Trends in investment have followed the same path as foreign trade . The market value of direct U.S. investments abroad ( in current dollars ) escalated from $379.1 billion in 1985 to $993.2 billion in 1993 . In that same short period , foreign direct investment in the United States jumped in market value from $220 billion to $745.6 billion . These figures do not include , we should note , indirect investment . We may reasonably conclude that the telecommunications needs of foreign firms with American investment and American firms investing abroad will be even greater than in the export and import situations . The reason is the daily need that home offices have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations . In contrast , sales and negotiations are apt to be more intermittent . In addition , international firms will often demand secure private networks . For example , in the 1960s IBM began building an internal global network ; by 1988 it extended to 145 countries and could serve to link employees throughout the company 's far-flung empire . By 1987 IBM was moving three trillion characters of internal information annually.5 While increased cross-border trade and investment together account for much of the expanded scope of telecommunications , there is a subtler concept at work , the impact of which will be even more dramatic . This is the concept of the global economy , which , while incorporating increased levels of trade and investment , includes far more . The idea of the global economy has both a consumer side and a producer side . The speed with which information can electronically move around the world is the most important facet of the global economy . Obviously , in every country there is much nationalism that resists cooperation , openness , and interdependence . Nevertheless , consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumers in the developed regions of the world gradually achieved what management expert Kenichi Ohmae has termed the " Californiaization of need , " and telecommunications has played a major role in this process . The products of McDonald 's , Adidas , and Coca-Cola , among many other firms , are sold almost everywhere . " Whatever their nationality , consumers .. . increasingly receive the same information , seek the same kinds of life styles , and desire the same kinds of products . They all want the best products available , at the lowest prices possible . Everyone , in a sense , wants to live ? and shop ? in California . " 6 At the cash register , very few of us care // whether the Sanyo boom box we are buying was assembled by a Japanese company in a Thai factory and contains components made in many countries . Consumer wants are not , however , permanent . Indeed , new trends and tads replace older ones more rapidly than ever before in some industries and services , such as apparel . Trends discerned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , there are still national or regional trends that are not imitated elsewhere ? which may provide an opportunity for introduction in another market . Regardless of how consumers may respond and the differences between various groups or nationalities , making sound marketing decisions for the future requires , in the first place , the collection of a considerable amount of information and , in the second place , the dissemination of that information throughout a global network . A product variation that is successful in Indonesia may , for example , be unpromising in the United States . Nevertheless , it is better that American firms receive such information than remain in blissful ignorance of it . We spoke in Chapter 1 about the importance of feedback , accuracy , and dialectic , and the power of modem telecommunications to solve the problems raised by these conceptions . Nowhere is the capability of resolving such issues greater than in the global arena . When one factors in the capabilities to store , manipulate , and retransmit marketing and other information that was unavailable only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that modern telecommunications provides to companies assessing and seeking to fulfill consumer demand . When one moves from the demand side of the ledger to the supply side , the enhanced benefits of modern telecommunications come even more to the fore . These advantages can be divided into two categories : those that reduce costs within a firm , and those that reduce costs between the subject firm and those with which it undertakes or may undertake transactions . Although Wal-Mart is largely a domestic company , it concretely typifies what may be done globally . Wal-Mart , a leader in the application of modem information technology , has created a massive communications system that transmits data from the cash registers of more than two thousand stores into an enormous database containing its vendors ' weekly point-of-sale data . Collecting and analyzing such data , Wal-Mart can rapidly determine how well particular product lines are selling and adopt new strategies very quickly . Out-of-stock information can focus on the responses of suppliers and encourage them to boost or lower production and adjust inventory carrying costs . Wal-Mart 's quick response time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an enormous advantage over less information-intensive competitors.7 This case only begins to illustrate the many ways in which modern // telecommunications shapes Wal-Mart 's business activities and strategies . And , it is difficult to consider the thousands of ways in which most other large enterprises are being transformed by the same forces . The Wal-Mart case illustrates the enlargement of the network idea in which information can flow from point to point at the speed of light and is processed and analyzed more quickly than ever before . It requires no leap of the imagination to appreciate that information can flow across oceans in the same blink of an eyelash that it can flow from Key West , Florida , to Bellingham , Washington . " New network services will make it possible for companies to be effectively managed and to compete anywhere , anytime . A top executive can hold a meeting with senior executives who remain in Tokyo , London , New York , and Des Moines in virtual reality .... Already it is possible to schedule , monitor , and coordinate the production of multiple factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 8 Based on a large number of case studies , Michael Porter and Victor E. Millar , two of the leading scholars of business strategy , have provided a set of generalizations about the dramatic changes that are being wrought by the telecommunications revolution , especially in the international area.9 They have concluded that information technology allows firms to collect and process more information up and down the value chain than ever before . Markets are thereby enlarged and competitiveness is intensified because of the more systematic and comprehensive ways in which pricing and other business information can be obtained and evaluated . Similarly , production can be made more efficient than ever before because of the information revolution . For example , fishermen now employ weather satellite data on ocean temperatures to more accurately identify promising fishing areas . Again , engineering and supply data about components in a finished product can be more readily evaluated ( and sometimes corrected ) through advanced telecommunications than ever before , thereby greatly lessening the " snafu " problems that have so often plagued producers . Porter and Millar conclude that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the globalization of the world economy . By dramatically reducing information and transaction costs , globalization allows firms to efficiently coordinate activities around the globe . This does not necessarily mean that large companies extend their own operations around the globe , for the very same kinds of telecommunications networks also explain the expansion of outsourcing , in which manufacturers link closely with independent suppliers with whom they are in constant contact and over whom they can exercise vigilant quality controls . to We can concisely sum up this section by noting Vice President Albert Gore 's observation that " time zones , not cost , will be the biggest barrier to // keeping in touch . " t I And , as the cost of telecommunications drops , the power of telecommunications increases . Globalization can only be stopped by foolish government nationalism . Response of Telecommunications Companies I he globalization of the world economy and the central role that modem telecommunications plays in it is , of course , no surprise to either the telecommunications industry or government leaders . The telecommunications industry has an obvious incentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we will see , they have done so through a variety of strategies , such as joint ventures and alliances with foreign firms , that are intended to create a single information supplier that can serve a customer throughout the world . The strategy , in short , is to serve as a one-step supplier of telecommunications services so that firms do not have to enter into separate agreements in different countries or regions . At the same time , the service provider can offer both a seamless telecommunications system with uniform standards throughout the customer 's marketing areas and a wide range of services including basic and advanced telecommunications services . One-stop telecommunications services from a single provider can , thus , lower transaction costs materially below what they would be if a customer had to arrange separate contracts with telecommunications firms in each nation or region . From the perspective of the telecommunications industry , the stakes in the global market are huge . In the first half of the 1990s corporate voice , data , and teleconferencing traffic volume between countries in messages per minute was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? about double the U.S. corporate domestic rate . Estimates of the total world communications market by the year 2000 range as high as $750 billion.12 While the enormous capital requirements to satisfy this demand alone indicate a principal reason for international alliances and might imply that only large firms can be significant players in international telecommunications , small companies , indeed , play roles in satisfying niche markets . Consider for example Verifone , Inc. , which gathers and transmits election data in Mexico . In the United States and other nations , Verifone makes and sells terminals that verify credit card and check transactions . Or consider Synoptics Communications , a leading provider in many countries of intelligent hubs that allow computers to talk to each other . Or consider IDB Communications Group , Inc. , which specializes in transmitting sporting events in the United States , Europe , and Asia . One could go on and on , but the point is eminently clear . The enormous international telecommunications market // has spurred the creation of numerous specialty firms , some of which will become major players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain niche players . In addition , the burgeoning telecommunications market has stimulated established firms in other fields to supply services and equipment . Thus , for example , by 1997 in Germany , savings hanks , railways , utilities , industrial companies , and insurance companies were pushing hard to establish networks for specialized services.13 The evidence presently indicates that international telecommunications is becoming increasingly competitive and , at the same time , increasingly heterogeneous , with a large number of services available in addition to POTS plain old telephone service . Increasingly crucial to a modern business system are such newer services as electronic data exchange ( including processing ) for orders , offers , invoices , confirmations , delivery , restocking ; videoconferencing ; videotex ( interactive screen-assisted data communications services ) ; on-line database services ; electronic mail ; high-speed facsimile and other visual information ; and electronic banking services . At the same time other new technologies allow the existing wireline network to be bypassed , including cellular telephone , cable television , satellite , personal communications services , new fiber-optic lines along railway or utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important consequences for intensifying global telecommunications competition . Consider the history of Sprint Corporation , the United States 's third largest long-distance company , to see the implications for global competition . Sprint 's long-distance business was born in January 1970 when the Southern Pacific Company , the holding company controlling important railroad properties , established it to provide private-line communications services to businesses , government agencies , and educational institutions . Southern Pacific Communications Corporation ( SPCC ) was the outgrowth of Southern Pacific 's large internal communication system along the company 's rights-of-way , which in 1969 covered almost 8,000 trac miles.14 In 1983 GTE , then the United States 's second largest telepho company , purchased SPCC , becoming a long-distance provider . G Sprint , the reorganized firm , was gradually purchased by United Telecom . munications , a large operator of local telephone systems , and in 1990 officially adopted Sprint as its name . Sprint expanded internationally and into a variety of other services . For example , in 1993 Sprint instituted KINKO 'S , a public videoconferencing network and in 1994 began long-distance service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story are two . First , rights-of-way are an enormously valuable resource in entering the telecommunications business . Rights-of-way that can be deployed to transmit electricity , gas , or railroad // traffic may also he used to transmit telecommunications traffic . Second , experience in private telecommunications systems can suggest entering into the public network business , and then into advanced services . The United tales led the way in permitting new entry into long distance and other telecommunications services , but other nations have been following a simnr path . For example , in May 1994 RWE , the German utility , and the Deutsche Bank won a contract to operate a data-transmission network in Gcrmany to compete against Deutsche Telekom , then a government-owned riser . Similarly , only one day before that announcement , two large Geran industrial corporations , BellSouth , the American regional Bell operatg company , and Vodafone , a British group , began operating E-PLUS , a mobile telephone network.15 The inevitable next steps are internationalizaon and adding more services to the original ones deployed by the entrant , r the same distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or me combination can frequently accommodate any kind of transmittable formation . In other words , information is the relevant product market , not voice , video , and so on . Thus , older firms , start-up enterprises , and companies entering telecommunications from other industries all may portend intense and widespread telecommunications competition in the global economy and its major markets . Two potential roadblocks lie in the way of this vision : capital requirents and governmental policy , including not only the traditional entry and regulatory barriers , but also the more difficult ones involving establishing international standards . Let us first look at the capital issues . According to one widely respected 1995 engineering economics study : " There 's a worldwide capital crisis right now , and there is n't enough money in the world 's capital markets to build the flashy new networks we keep hearing so much about .... The harsh reality is that there simply is not enough money in the world to meet all the demands of the telecommunications industry , let alone those of anyone else . " 16 For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's largest company , had to delay its plan to upgrade its local access network beyond 2015 , the initial target year . One method of creasing cash as well as attracting financial backing is to sharply cut costs , especially labor costs . Many important telecommunications carriers , especially current and formerly publicly owned ones , are under intense cost-cutting pressures in order to effectively compete in the global arena . For example , Deutsche Telekom in 1995 had twice as many employees per Customer as the average American telephone carrier and four times as many as a typical American cable company . According to the foregoing study , Deutsche Telekom would have to discharge many employees in order to compete effectively against American carriers . 1 14 HOW AMERICA GOT ON t INt Two other consequences follow from the capital-shortage problem . First , there is an incentive to reduce embedded costs . " Thus , major global projects will be largely wireless . Second , since any single firm would be hard pressed to meet very ambitious global plans , there is a very strong incentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of incentives that have led to the spate of cross-border alliances , but certainly increasing capital as well as reducing risk in a large-scale capital commitment are among them . Iridium World Communications , one of the most ambitious projects ever conceived in telecommunications , illustrates these consequences . In June 1990 , Motorola announced the Iridium project , the purpose of which was to allow small portable telephones to communicate with other telephones from any location in the world to any other place . The twentyfive-ounce handset could conveniently fit in an overcoat pocket . The system was originally intended to deploy seventy-seven low-earth-orbit satellites . While Motorola was confident of the technology , it viewed financing as the major obstacle in implementing the plan , anticipating that the cost of putting the service into operation within six years would be $2.3 billion . Accordingly , it sought partners in the operation . By January 1993 Motorola announced that it had received only tentative commitments from potential investors , but no binding commitments . The number of satellites had been scaled back to sixty-six . Notwithstanding these difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had obtained $733.5 million in new equity capital in Japan to supplement the $840 million it had raised in 1993 . Motorola , however , had to put in more of its own money than it had originally planned . But its partners included DDI ( Japan 's second largest telephone company ) , a Brazilian construction company , VEBA ( the German utility ) , Sony , Mitsubishi , Sprint , and other investors throughout the world . ' 7 Motorola 's difficulties , however , were far from over . In September 1995 it had to cancel plans to sell $300 million in junk bonds because of lack of investor interest . In part , investor resistance stemmed from the fact that by late 1995 Iridium faced other large consortia , most importantly Globalstar , seeking to be the first to deploy a global satellite phone network . Financial experts doubted whether all could raise sufficient capital , notwithstanding that the participants included some of the world 's largest corporations , such as Microsoft . Nevertheless , a market that could be worth $15 billion and have thirty-five million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty-first century was a powerful magnet . In mid-1996 , however , Iridium continued to face financial difficulties , selecting two of the world 's largest banks to arrange short-term and permanent financing amounting to approximately $3.15 billion . In spring 1977 an initial public offering of stock was announced . Network launch was scheduled for late 19 ) 98.18 The Iridium project is one of the most ambitious ever conceived . Nonetheless , it typifies two of the strongest themes in global telecommunications stemming from capital issues : the search for partners and the search for ways of ' lowering embedded costs . The Government Response We have seen in this chapter the growth of international connections and telecommunication 's role in globalization . We have observed the increasing importance of information technology in the future prospects of large and small firms and the economies of nations and regions . Business , culture , education , entertainment , and virtually every other facet of life are nourished by modem telecommunications . In the last section we looked briefly at telecommunications firms ' responses and intentions to the new opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new situation . Francois Bar , a leading expert in the area , succinctly summarized a widely held view on government 's roles in the process : " If technology diffusion is to be the overarching policy goal , governments have an important role to play in facilitating access to the technology , in preparing the grounds for its diffusion , in stimulating its implementation . " 19 Governments can play a variety of roles , including removing regulatory and other impediments to telecommunications development , encouraging competition and diversity , providing and assisting the provision of rights-of-way , encouraging the adoption of uniform standards , and facilitating the interconnection of the various subnetworks into larger ones . On the other hand , it is possible for government bureaucrats to go too far and start dictating business policy and technological choices . National governments throughout the world as well as regional authorities and international organizations are groping their ways to the adoption of appropriate policies . The inexorable direction that most governments in the world have taken is toward privatization of government monopolies and the introduction of competition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this section will illustrate these processes . Privatization ends the dependence of telecommunications firms on governments , which in almost all cases are hard pressed to solve budget deficit problems . Indeed , the sales of those huge properties to investors help to reduce deficits . At the same time , privatized firms have easier access to capital markets and more flexibility in attracting additional capital through joint ventures , the sale of stock , borrowing on more flexible terms , and so on . The introduction of competition ( often called liberalization ) permits the introduction of still more capital in telecommunications . At the same time , the force of competition provides // strong incentives for efficient operation and the introduction of novel and diverse technologies . United States firms , the clear leaders in technology and efficiency , have of course taken advantage of the new situation to invest heavily throughout the world . And this , in turn , further assists the process of globalization . Thus , we might say that government 's most important new role is getting out of the way ! Prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in it is simply described . The United States , as we have seen , was dominated by AT &T,; the vertically integrated network manager that controlled the local loop , long distance , switching and transmission gear , and customer premises equipment . Legal controversies that ultimately upset the system had erupted in long-distance and customer premises equipment . As we will see in Chapter 8 , the computer-communications interface provided a particularly vexing set of issues . Associated with AT &T; were a large number of local-loop carriers ranging in size from GTE , a giant in its own right with major operations in such rapidly expanding areas as southern California and the west coast of Florida , to very small carriers such as the Ragland Telephone Company of Ragland , Alabama , and the Valley Telephone Company of Baggs , Wyoming . Texas alone had more than sixty such companies not affiliated with AT &T,; GTE , or any other large holding company.20 Regulating this cooperating structure were the F.C.C. and the various state regulatory commissions . The systems that prevailed in most of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward . Canada was a hybrid system consisting of privately owned carriers in the most populous parts of the country and government ownership in the prairie provinces . A national administrative commission regulated the private monopolies . But the model that prevailed in most of the rest of the world was different again . A government monopoly typically owned and operated the post office and telephone and telegraph systems ( hence the acronym PTT ) . Typifying the extent to which the system was deeply ingrained and universally accepted , the West German constitution ( Grundgesetz ) of 1949 proclaimed that the new federal government would be regulator , operator , and provider of the telecommunications infrastructure . Thus , a constitutional amendment was required to change the structure.21 In each case the telephone monopoly 's equipment was supplied by one or a few privately owned companies . In the case of the larger nations , such as West Germany or France , the equipment suppliers were frequently national firms . For example , Siemens and AEG were the largest equipment suppliers in Germany , while Thomson-CSF ( nationalized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France.22 While , of course , less developed countries did not have // telecommunications equipment manufacturing industries , the pattern remained the same : a publicly owned operating monopoly and a few favored suppliers . Another way of appreciating how deeply ingrained this system was is to consider it historically . Germany provides a good example . The German public monopoly system can be traced back to 1505 when the Hapsburg emperor Maximilian granted exclusive mail-carrying privileges to the Italian Taxis family in exchange for a large share of the profits . The system 's profitability was greater than expected and led to a corollary policy that stemmed from the monopoly grant ? vigorous protection from others who sought to operate rival systems . In 1614 Prussia made the next important policy development by establishing a state-run monopoly . Those persons who instituted the Prussian system made no bones about their fundamental intention of using the system to generate revenues for the state 's activities . When the telegraph came into use in the nineteenth century , it was integrated into the overall publicly owned communications system , a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone was invented in 1876 , it , too , was incorporated in the public communications systems . In 1892 the Telegraph Act was amended , guaranteeing that the Telegraph Administration would exclusively provide telephone service . As we noted , these systems became known as PTTs in view of their three major activities.23 Before examining the pressures and incentives for the changes to privatization and competition in Germany and elsewhere , it should be observed that residential consumer dissatisfaction was clearly not a factor . In fact , the trade unions , social-democratic parties , and consumer organizations resisted the transformation . Further , we should not underestimate the sheer force of inertia and tradition that would make it difficult to radically reform centuries-old institutional arrangements . Again , Germany is the most instructive case to illustrate the forces arrayed against the dramatic transformation . As late as 1985 the Economist reported , " The Bundespost has no plans , secret or not , to deregulate anything . Its near absolute control over German telecommunications is secured by constitutional protection , by its position as West Germany 's biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in telecoms ) and government cash cow ... and by its administrative independence . " 24 Supervision was extremely light and telecommunications revenues were deployed to subsidize , in part , the postal operation 's enormous losses . While it was true that telephone rental charges were twice those of Britain 's , Gerd Tanzer , Bundepost 's telecommunications chief , nonetheless confidently asserted that there was a social consensus in favor of retaining the publicly owned monopoly system . And yet later it was transformed . // Although each nation has its distinctive history , Japan with the world 's second largest economy and telecommunications system provides a good illustration of the forces leading to change as well as those whose objections had to be overcome . The Japanese telecommunications system can hr traced back to 1869 , when the Ministry of Technology established telegraph service between Tokyo and Yokohama.25 The progress that had been achieved until World War II was reversed by the devastation visited on Japan in that conflict ; Osaka , for example , had only 51 percent of the telephones installed in March 1951 that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Telecommunications Law of 1953 and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Law of 1952 . The effect of these laws was to create a government corporation with a monopoly over domestic telecommunications . The new corporation ( NTT ) , although government owned , was modeled on AT &T.; Early on , NTT established major research facilities patterned on Bell Labs , which laid much of the groundwork for Japan 's widespread transistor technology as well as making important advances in memory chips , electronic switching , and data processing.26 bike AT &T,; NTT could argue that tampering with its structure might destroy an invaluable research resource . Additionally , the new public-monopoly corporation was assumed to be more efficient than competitive or smaller-scale enterprises , and its monopoly status would prevent wasteful duplicative capital investment that could be deployed more effectively elsewhere . The Diet desired the creation of a nationwide system that would reach the remotest parts of the nation at uniformly low local rates . A government monopoly was conceived as the best mechanism to attain these results . On April 1 , 1985 , Japan began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into a private company and liberalization , previously restricted to peripheral markets , began . United States trade pressures intended to open the equipment market played a role . But it must be remembered that Japan , an export-led economy , was in the forefront of establishing the global economy . Thus , Japan 's fear of United States trade retaliation was a recognition of the new global economy as was the American pressure on Japan . But more important was the role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) , the powerful government agency that plays a caretaker role for Japan 's export industries . MITI 's planners strongly urged further deregulation of data communications so that private carriers could offer innovative new services to Japanese firms that would assure their competitiveness in the global economy . MITI officials held that the NTT monopoly was delaying the necessary integration of computers and telecommunications without which Japanese firms , especially in the leading electronics sector , would fall behind in foreign // markcts . NTT , it was also noted , was becoming grossly inefficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Additionally , since NTT purchased more than one-half of its equipment from onlv four domestic firms , both potential foreign and domestic suppliers joined in the push for NTT privatization and liberalization . Further , large and small Japanese firms , including electronics manufacturers , computer firms , trading companies , and transport companies sought the opportunity compete in the potentially lucrative telecommunications network market . veil some NTT executives saw the benefits of competition to their company , especially in the provision of newer , more lucrative services.27 The change in Japan did not , of course , instantly create a competitive market . Much resistance remained ( and remains ) . Opponents can still place roadblocks in the path . The important message , however , is that the general irection of telecommunications policy did an about-face , just as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom . The basic theme of the increasing Importance of modern telecommunications to the competitiveness of local business interests in the global marketplace was , once again , a central one . Without the full complement of telecommunications services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually every industrial and service sector would be severely handicapped . Accordingly , governmental actors got behind the movement to privatize and liberalize . Precisely the same considerations applied in the nations of Western Europe , although ( with the exception of the United Kingdom ) their wake-up call came much later than in the United States and Japan . The principal agency of change in Western Europe has been the institutions of the European Union , which bind together economic and social policies of France , Germany , Italy , the United Kingdom , and smaller Western European nations . The documents produced under the auspices of the European Union 's associated institutions are particularly explicit in asserting the themes mentioned in this section . A 1993 European Commission white paper ( published in 1994 ) , prepared at the request of the European Council to design a medium-term strategy for growth , competitiveness , and employment , gloomily acknowledged that in the prior twenty years Europe 's rate of growth sharply declined , unemployment steadily rose from cycle to cycle , the investment rate had decreased , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to North America and Japan had worsened in regard to research and development , innovation , and the introduction of new products.28 At the heart of the white paper 's conclusions was the observation that the information revolution that the world is undergoing is as radical a transformation as the industrial revolution . Acknowledging that the United States has taken a strong lead in the transformation , // the white paper concluded , " This issue is a crucial aspect in the survival or decline of Europe . . . . It can provide an answer to the new needs of European societies : communications networks within companies ; widespread teleworking ; widespread access to scientific and leisure databases ; development of preventative health care and home medicine for the elderly . " 29 The European Council at its December 1993 meeting fully endorsed the white paper , commissioning a report on the information society to be prepared by a group of prominent persons . The report , popularly called the Bangemann Report after Martin Bangemann , its chairperson , provided concrete recommendations for action . Its most important recommendation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the member states into the information age . Accordingly , it strenuously urged the EU and its member states to strike down the monopoly or deeply entrenched positions of the PTTs and their respective cozy relationships with favored national equipment suppliers . Finally , the Bangemann Report called for the adoption of common member nation technical standards and government regulations . Notably missing from the report was an explicit call for privatization of the country networks , but the implication was unmistakable in view of the other proposals.30 The Bangemann Report was submitted to the European Council for its meeting in Corfu in June 1994 . The Council essentially endorsed the report 's conclusion , emphasizing that primary responsibility for modernization and expansion of the networks lies with the private sector . The roles of the EU and the member states were conceived as providing encouragement and a stable , predictable regulatory framework . Referred back to the Commission pursuant to European Union law , the Commission released its crucial Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on July 19 , 1994 . Once again , the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission called for accelerating the rate of ongoing liberalization . The document noted that the Commission had already taken an active role in liberalizing telecommunications competition under articles 85 , 86 , and 90 of the 1957 Treaty Establishing the European Communities ( popularly called the Treaty of Rome ) and amendments . Finally , the document generally reached the same conclusions as the previously cited documents had , noting that " The information society promises to create new jobs , enhanced social solidarity . . . and cultural diversity , " but warning that " Its advent is likely to generate some fears , which should not be underestimated . " 32 The next step in the European process was the production of a green paper on telecommunications infrastructure , which the Commission 's July 19 , 1994 , report requested . ( A green paper is a formal Commission docuINTERNATIONALIZATION // ment with recommendations submitted to the Council and the European Parliament . ) In the strongest statement made to that time , the Commission , in remarks worth quoting extensively , warned : Everyone is busy preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . It also includes the USA , Canada and Japan ? Europe 's principal economic competitors . The nature of that economic competition itself is also changing . To compete effectively today , one must have the means to access , to process , manipulate , stock and produce information quickly and effectively . One must also have good access to markets and to customers all around the globe . It is therefore vital that Europe places itself at the forefront of this inevitable drive towards a global information society . Telecommunications infrastructures will form the fundamental platform upon which Europe 's society and economy will depend in the decades to come.33 And what is true of Europe is true of the rest of the world . The inevitable outcome is to strengthen globalization , in which transnational organizations will play an increasingly important role . International Telecommunications Organizations Soon after Samuel Morse successfully sent the first telegraph message between Washington , D.C. , and Baltimore in 1844 , the device was adopted in other nations . Because the telegraph was frequently used for military and political purposes , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to safeguard the security of its messages . Accordingly , messages had to be transcribed , translated , and passed over to national authorities at borders . As the commercial use of the telegraph expanded , it was obvious that this system was unsatisfactory and wasteful . On May 17 , 1865 , the first breakthrough to international standards occurred when the International Telegraph Convention was signed by twenty countries and the International Telegraph Union was created to deal with subsequent issues and later technologies . Thus , in 1885 the International Telegraph Union began the task of drafting legislation concerning the telephone . In 1906 the first International Radiotelegraph Convention was signed . The original regulations have been revised and amended many times.34 As the power of telecommunications to easily travel the globe became a reality with the advent of commercial radio in the 1920s , the establishment of standards became a more technical one , requiring the creation of a separate international organization to deal with these increasingly complex issues . Accordingly , in 1927 the International Radio Consultative Committee ( CCIR ) was created . Together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for coordinating tech122 HOW AMERICA GOT ONLINE nical studies , for testing and measurement , and for drawing up international standards . In 1927 , the first fruits of CCIR 's efforts were borne when frequency bands were allocated to the various radio services in use , such as maritime , broadcasting , and amateur . The rationale of CCIR 's allocations scheme was to assign frequencies based on the technical characteristics of each service . Nevertheless , standard setting , although couched in the highly technical language of electrical engineering , sometimes conceals bitter political or intercorporate disputes . Before continuing with the discussion of the development of international telecommunications institutions , one of the most important tasks of which is the development of standards , it will be useful to digress and look more closely at the conception of standards . Paul A. David has devised what many scholars view as the best classification system for telecommunications . He proposes three categories of standards , each of which raises different sets of issues : reference , minimum attribute , and compatibility.35 Reference standards are those dealing with weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards are only technical , consider , for a moment , the political and economic ramifications if Congress proposed that the United States should adopt the metric system . David 's second category is minimum attribute standards , by which he means minimum requirements before a product or service can be deemed acceptable , such as minimum tensile strength of a wire . Compatibility standards are those that allow a part to function within a system . For example , modems must be compatible with both the telephone networks and the computers that send and receive data . There are , of course , a variety of such standards that must be compatible with other parts of a network . Again , it is sometimes important for a new device to be compatible with older products . For example , color television signals , when introduced , had to be compatible with black and white television sets . In each situation the stakes can be high , and as telecommunications has become increasingly international , disputes are resolved at international levels . With the paramount issue of standards in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking up with the important 1932 Madrid Conference , at which the various conventions were consolidated and the decision made to establish the International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) , effective January 1 , 1934 . The ITU assumed international jurisdiction over all forms of communication , recognizing their increasing interconnectability . The 1930s were a time of world disintegration , however , so the ITU did little until after the conclusion of World War II . In 1947 the ITU became a specialized agency of the United Nations . Among its initial measures was the establishment of the International FreINTERNATIONALIZATION // quency Registration l3oard ( IFRB ) , the task of which was to allocate the increasingly complex frequency spectrum among the various services . In 1956 advances in telecommunications spectrum use led to the establishment of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee ( CCITT ) to deal with standards issues . The CCIR continued in existence , and its efforts were expected to be coordinated with CCITT . The next year saw a dramatic event that set in motion a series of developments , eventually leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the next important international organization . In that year the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I , the first artificial satellite . While the Soviet Union led the way into space , the United States soon overtook it in commercial applications . AT &T's; Telestar satellite was launched in July 1962 , and in April 1965 Early Bird , the first communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit ( appearing relatively motionless from the earth ) was launched . Based on the theories of British physicist Arthur Clarke , the central discovery was that three satellites , placed in a geosynchronous orbit 120 degrees apart , could deliver communications to the entire world.36 While some satellites must orbit over the poles to provide communications to higher latitudes , the geostationary satellites do not move relative to the earth , thereby permitting antennae on the ground to remain stationary . Responding to the momentous potential of communications satellites , Intelsat was created in 1964 , largely through United States initiative . The preliminary step was the United States ' creation of Communications Satellite Corporation ( Comsat ) , pursuant to the Communications Satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of public or private ownership , Congress and President John Kennedy devised a compromise . Comsat was established as a corporation half-owned by carriers such as AT &T; and half-owned by shareholders . Subsequently , the private carriers sold their shares and relinquished their right to select three of the corporation 's nine directors . Three other directors were selected by the government and three by the shareholders . Comsat 's initial mission was to help organize Intelsat , which occurred in August 1964 when eleven developed nations signed an interim agreement . Intelsat 's membership was subsequently greatly expanded to about 130 members , and the United States 's influence was diminished . Intelsat membership is open to any ITU member , but costs and revenues are based on each nation 's investment , which in turn is based on percentage of use during the preceding six months . The organization began operating in 1965 when the United States launched Early Bird , the first commercial communications satellite , the development costs of which were borne by Comsat . In 1969 , as Intelsat added satellites , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelsat 's major market was intended to be and still is overseas telephone calls , it has enlarged its market to offer other services to its members as well as other countries . These include the transmission of live international broadcasts ; transcontinental airline booking ; secure international banking transactions ; international simultaneous remote printing of newspapers , such as the Financial Times ; digital services that can offer integrated voice , data , telex , fax , and videoconferencing ; and back-up service in cases of other service outages . Typically , a carrier , such as AT &T,; orders Intelsat services through Comsat , while in other nations a carrier was required to go through the national PTT . Thus , at its formation and for years afterward , Intelsat was a monopolist in the provision of international telecommunications transmitted through satellite . Such an arrangement was , of course , to be expected in an organization set up when national telecommunications was either provided by a state-owned or private monopoly . A combination of technology and the movement toward privatization and liberalization began to undermine Intelsat 's monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door to international satellite service outside the Intelsat framework . In 1983 two American companies , Orion Satellite Corporation and International Satellite , Inc. , applied to the F.C.C. requesting the opportunity to launch and operate independent commercial satellite systems linking North America and Europe . The issue of competition was now clearly on the agenda since the two firms intended to attract customers that had been doing such business with Intelsat . Because of the Intelsat agreement 's implications , the Departments of State and Commerce requested the F.C.C. to delay proceedings pending the results of an interagency review . Nevertheless , the lucrative potential of international satellite communications attracted still other applicants seeking F.C.C. authorization to provide similar services . Comsat uniformly opposed the F.C.C. granting such authority on the ground that it would violate the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 and the Intelsat agreements . Intelsat took the unusual step of intervening in a domestic United States proceeding , essentially arguing that granting any such application would be inconsistent with Article XIV of the Intelsat agreements by substantially impairing the economic viability of the organization.38 But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a propitious year in the United States for restricting competition . The tides were clearly turning . Accordingly , President Ronald Reagan signed in November 1984 a Presidential Determination that alternative satellite systems are " required in the national interest " within the meaning of the Communications Satellite Act . At the same time the Departments of State and Commerce informed the F.C.C. of the criteria by which satellite competition could be furthered // without impairing the United States 's obligations to Intelsat . Essentially , new competitors would be required to provide long-lease service and could not connect into the public switched message network . Further , foreign authorities would consult with the United States to assure technical compatibility and avoid economic harm . The scenario that would inevitably follow was similar to the one by which MCI originally sought a niche market and gradually became a full-scale competitor of AT &T.; And just as AT &T; resisted what it perceived to be continuing encroachment , Comsat played loch the same role in connection with international satellite communications . Thus , Comsat fought Pan Am Sat 's application on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central , and South America , the Caribbean , and Spain would cause substantial economic harm.39 The second prong of the attack on Intelsat 's monopoly is fiber optics , over which it enjoys no jurisdiction . Fiber optics began to compete with satellites , converging into one market . Consider the advances in optical fiber technology and their implications for the future . TAT-1 , the first transatlantic telephone cable , was built in 1956 and had a thirty-six-circuit capacity . ( Previously high-frequency radio had been used for transatlantic %vice communication . ) The Early Bird satellite decisively outclassed telephone cable with its 480 telephone channels , compared with the 256 then carried by telephone cable . Additionally , satellites covered a much greater area . Thus , until the advent of fiber optics it appeared satellites would dominate international communications . In December 1988 TAT-8 , the first fiber-optic transoceanic cable , became operational . Owned by thirty firms , Including AT &T,; MCI , British Telecom , and France Telecom , the optical cable had a capacity of 37,800 voice channels . TAT-8 was only the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Signaling the new competitive challenge to Intelsat , AT &T; immediately reduced its transatlantic rates when TAT-8 opened . Not only did bandwidth costs drop , but line errors decreased and fiber optics overcame the time-delay problem of satellites.40 The advance of fiber optics from the opening of TAT-8 was rapid ; for example , by late 1995 optical links carried 65 percent of the United Kingdom 's international connections . TAT-13 became operational in fall 1996 . TAT-12 and TAT-13 , owned by fortyeight carriers ( linking the United States and Europe ) , have the capacity to carry more than one million telephone conversations at the same time.41 By 1991 it was clear that technology had forced the advent of competition . On November 27 , 1991 , the State Department and the Commerce Department 's National Telecommunications and Information Administration fully endorsed eliminating interconnection restrictions for Intelsat 's satellite competitors by 1997 . The F.C.C. endorsed the interconnection // principle in 1992 , pointing out that the delay until 1997 would allow Intelsat a reasonable amount of time to adjust to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the clear handwriting on the wall . Irving Goldstein , its director general , proclaimed , " The spread of deregulation , the corporatization and privatization of national telecommunications providers , the growth of competitive industries , and the proliferation of new satellite companies have created greater choice in the marketplace , and , therefore , greater competition for market share . In light of these dynamic changes , Intelsat is transforming itself in order to remain competitive . " 42 And looming as still another threat is the Internet ( which we will look at in Chapter 8 ) .43 Completing the Circuit : Alliances The convergence of the political trends toward liberalization and privatization in communications , albeit at different rates throughout the world , globalization of the world economy ( thanks significantly to telecommunications ) , new competitors , and new technologies have reshaped the global market for telecommunications . Industrial and service companies that conduct transactions throughout the world have an obvious incentive to reduce their communications costs , assure a high standard of service , and obtain a wide variety of information services . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a company enters into a single contract for all or most of its telecommunications needs . Consider the experience of Grand Metropolitan , a major British consumer-goods manufacturer : " Instead of haggling one-by-one with hundreds of the world 's local telephone companies , Grand Met is turning its entire global voice and data network over to Concert , a joint venture of BT and MCI. " 44 In general , companies that do business in many locations ? an increasingly widespread phenomenon have provided the impetus for the establishment of global communications networks . And , of course , it follows that these large consumers of telecommunications services desire intense competition between multiple providers . The result of global companies ' demand has been telephone company creation of a complex web of cross-border agreements , mergers , external growth , and so-called strategic alliances . Some of these arrangements have failed , while others have succeeded . Some arrangements have increased the number of their participants , while others have maintained the same number of participants as they had at the times of their creation . The most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-distance carriers , AT &T; and Sprint , and by British Telecom PLC , which acquired MCI in 1996 and 1997 . But before looking at these alliances , we will look more // closely at what " strategic alliance " conventionally means and the important objectives , in addition to satisfying customer needs , that these arrangements serve . As we explore these issues , it is important to bear in mind that there may be several reasons two or more firms enter into such an arrangement . For example , two or more firms may collaborate not only because this provides a better opportunity to secure the business of a large customer , but also because technology sharing may benefit both telecommunications providers . A strategic alliance " links specific facets of the businesses of two or more firms . At its core , this link is a trading partnership that enhances the effectiveness of the competitive strategies of the participating firms by providing for the mutually beneficial trade of technologies , skills or products based on them . " 45 Thus , strategic alliances are neither mergers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they agreements between firms that are country specific ; their ambition is to circle the globe or large portions of it . Obviously , strategic alliances between potential rivals are made with the expectation ( not always fulfilled ) that the marginal benefit from cooperation will outweigh the marginal cost from conflict that inevitably arises when two or more different corporate cultures are blended . Based on a wealth of experience , the chief executive of Coming Glass offered four criteria for the success of a strategic alliance : compatible strategy and culture , comparable contribution , comparable strengths , and no conflict of interest . He emphasized that , in addition to these threshold factors , luck and determination were also required.46 In the telecommunications area strategic alliances as well as cross-border alliances can occur for a variety of reasons in addition to meeting the enlarged needs of customers . First , they can be driven by a disparity in the factors of production . For example , in telecommunications equipment manu facture , one partner may have large amounts of surplus cash while the other may be strapped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , the huge sunken costs of capital equipment may create vast economies of scale so that the linkup can greatly enlarge the customer base over which costs may be amortized . Third , two or more firms may lower their individual research and development costs by collaborating . Fourth , the two or more firms may have complementary technologies or skills . For example , one firm may have great strengths in marketing while the other may have great technological prowess . Fifth , there may be regulatory or legal harriers that restrict one firm from operating effectively or at all in another country or region . An alliance is the answer . For example , Canada 's Telecom Act requires that facilities-based carriers must have 80 percent Canadian directors and Canadians must own 80 percent of the voting shares . Sixth , even without formal barriers to entry , one firm may find it // difficult to operate in another country or region because of the cozy business relationships between national companies that have been established over many years . For example , as early as 1983 AT &T; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch electronics company ) , two giant European firms , to market telecommunications equipment in Europe . Both alliances were intended to facilitate AT &T's; entry into the European market , in which it had little experience.47 Parenthetically , both of these early strategic alliances were dissolved because they failed to live up to their partners ' expectations . Seventh , strategic alliances can be driven by market-share considerations . An alliance , for example , may reduce the number of potential competitors or increase the overall market shares of the two or more partners in a nation or region . Finally , strategic alliances may be defensive in nature . If your rival does it , you must do the same in order to compete effectively . Canada , whose cross-border long-distance traffic with the United States is the largest in the world , provides an example of some of these considerations in practice . Initially , as we observed , Canada restricts foreign ownership quite severely ; many countries do . Nevertheless , in September 1992 MCI entered into a strategic alliance with Stentor , the major Canadian long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel alliance with Unitel , the second largest Canadian long-distance carrier . Inevitably , Sprint then allied with Call-Net , another Canadian long-distance carrier , in August 1993 . Each of these alliances were within the permitted level of voting shares allowed to non-Canadians . Each alliance was based on other considerations as well as market ones . Stentor acquired MCI 's intelligent network software , which could enable it to develop new services . Unitel obtained switches , transmission equipment , and software in exchange for AT &T's; 20 percent share of the company . Additionally , Unitel was able to appoint senior AT &T; operating personnel and was provided access to AT &T's; extraordinary research and development prowess . CallNet received the rights to Sprint 's network and billing technology as well as other Sprint products . Additionally , Call-Net could undertake marketing programs using the name " Sprint Canada . " 48 As the strategic-alliance structure developed , by late 1996 three such groups predominated among the many that have been formed . The oldest of these is Concert Communications , the members of which were BT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase 20 percent of MCI 's shares and was intended to offer customers a full complement of voice , video , data , and multimedia services . Analysts saw BT 's cash investment in MCI as quid pro quo for MCI 's marketing prowess in obtaining global corporate customers and technical skills . At the time of the investment MCI // was expected to use the new cash to make other alliances and acquisitions in the cable , television , cellular , and multimedia industries in the United States and elsewhere . Most importantly , the two companies intended to create a seamless telecommunications service throughout the world with one-stop billing and ordering for its customers . Notwithstanding AT &T's; regulatory objections , the United States Justice Department approved the agreement in June 1994 . The Concert arrangement did not preclude BT Iirom establishing other alliances in Europe and Asia . On November 4 , 1996 , 13T-MCI 's ties moved even closer when BT agreed to acquire MCI.49 The second major alliance , dominated by AT &T,; is very different in structure from Concert . Called World Partners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unisource , a European consortium of Dutch , Swedish , and Swiss PTTs . Unisource is linked with AT &T; and Unitel as well as other carriers in Asia , most importantly KDD in Japan . The alliance between AT &T; and Unisource , which was preceded by some of AT &T's; Asian alliances , completed AT &T's; global system in June 1994 . Again , the underlying idea was to create seamless , one-stop global shopping for telecom services . The arrangement was to some extent defensive on AT &T's; part . John Finnegan , AT &T's; international-alliances vice president , conceded that AT &T; would have lost key corporate customers if it had not constructed a strategic alliance that embraced Europe , North America , and Asia.50 Different from both AT &T's; and British Telecom ? MCI 's ventures is the alliance into which Sprint has entered . Originally called Phoenix ( later Global One ) , it includes France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom , the PTTs in their respective countries . Each of the PTTs agreed to take a 10 percent stake in Sprint . Unlike the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stock market on the ground that Sprint 's aggressive corporate culture could not be blended with the stolid PTTs that , unlike BT , were still state-owned at the time of the alliance 's formation . The alliance was conceived largely as defensive on Sprint 's part . Nevertheless , Sprint 's chairman was extremely enthusiastic , envisioning worldwide voice , data , and video transmission services for multinational companies , as well as international consumer services , such as calling cards . Sprint received a huge cash injection while its PTT partners received access to the world 's largest market . Again , American and European regulators and antitrust authorities eventually approved the alliance.5 t There are many other alliances , mergers , and arrangements as we move irrepressibly forward into the global economy and , of course , there will be yet more . No industry has made more rapid strides in this direction than telecommunications , beginning in 1984 when the industry was largely a // collection of state enterprises that did not reach beyond their borders . Telecommunications has been both a cause and effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as the three grand alliances illustrate , the rest of the world appears to be mirroring the American model in the telecommunications sector . One conclusion is clear as the firms form and re-form alliances . The major players will attempt to offer virtually all services and will employ all transmission systems that are economically viable . Because mistakes can be very costly , each alliance will attempt to cover all bases in the converging international hypercornmunications marketplace . 7 The Wireless Revolution The Origins of Wireless less than twenty-eight years after Samuel F.B. Morse invented a practical telegraph in 1837 and thirteen years before Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone in 1876 , James Clerk Maxwell , the greatest nineteenth-century physicist , presented a paper that would revolutionize the world . Addressing the Royal Society , Maxwell presented a theory showing that electromagnetic fields could be propagated through space as well as through conductors . Moreover , they could travel as waves with the speed of light ( 186,252 miles per second ) . In his view , light itself was electromagnetic radiation within a certain range of wavelengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light as well as electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths . It was not until the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in 1887 ? 88 that electromagnetic waves were generated , detected , and measured . Hertz , however , was concerned only about scientific discovery , eschewing any interest in the economic implications of his research . Based on Hertz 's research , the English physicist Oliver Lodge undertook the next step , demonstrating in 1894 an effective and practical system of wireless transmission and reception . But Lodge , too , failed to see the commercial possibilities ? although he later did participate in such ventures . The early technology of wireless was then in place . ) Physicists would continue to investigate the theoretical basis of radiation ; but the theory of the electromagnetic spectrum was now ready , and the world awaited the insights and business acumen that would develop the practical application of radio waves . Guglielmo Marconi was the visionary who saw the commercial opportunities of radio . In 1896 , at the age of twenty-two , he was granted the first radio patent and soon demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the crucial step occurred in December 1901 when Marconi transmitted the letter s in Morse code from Cornwall , England , 131 // across the Atlantic Ocean to Newtbundland . C'onfbunding many critics Marconi 's effort demonstrated , first , that radio waves , transmitted without the aid of wires , produced and detected by electrical circuits , could travel great distances . Second , he showed that such waves could be translated into intelligible information.2 Marconi 's success led to the postulation of the ionosphere ( or Kennelly-Heaviside layer ) , atmospheric layers of ions that refract waves back to earth . Marconi 's success and the commercial possibilities it opened induced many other inventors and entrepreneurs to focus their efforts on radio . Among the most important set of discoveries associated with inventor Lee de Forest was the development of vacuum tubes that could be used in voice-frequency amplifiers , among other purposes . It is a long way from transmitting the letter s in Morse code to transmitting music and intelligible speech . AT &T; was to play a major role in this progress because amplification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wireless and long-distance wire communication , to which AT &T; had become committed . In fact , when Alexander Graham Bell , seated in New York , replicated his famous statement to Thomas Watson , seated in San Francisco , " Mr. Watson , come here , I want you , " a modified version of de Forest 's vacuum tube was used to fulfill modulation and amplification functions . Nevertheless , early on AT &T; did not seriously consider that wireless would become a serious competitor to wire communication for point-to-point conversation because of the ease with which third parties could eavesdrop on private conversations . Accordingly , wireless was conceived as a supplement to wire in point-to-point communication . Additionally , transmitting long-distance radio entailed enormous power requirements compared with wire communication , imposing major economic as well as technological difficulties.3 The Rise of Radio and Television Nevertheless , broadcasting and point-to-point communications across areas that wires could not practically traverse were sufficiently potentially large markets to encourage considerable research in radio . There was still a pot of gold to be had . Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasting becoming a major new industry in the 1920s . In 1906 Reginald Fessenden of the University of Pittsburgh developed a continuous-wave generator in which voice currents were superimposed on a carrier wave . ( Continuous waves are those generated by pure tones . ) Demodulation would , therefore , allow the sending voice to be received and understood . On Christmas Eve , 1906 , Fessenden broadcast a music and speech program that was picked up by several ships in the North // Atlantic . Capitalizing on Fessenden 's work , Frank Conrad , the engineer in charge of Westinghouse 's wireless research during World War I , innocently began broadcasting phonograph records in the Pittsburgh area during spring 1920 . Soon , a growing number of listeners began making musical requests . Next , Conrad devised a regular schedule for broadcasting records . Exhausting his personal collection , Conrad borrowed additional titles from a local record store in exchange for which the store 's name and location were mentioned on the air . The commercial possibilities became clear when the record store discovered that its sales of recordings played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the explanation for this development was that a local department store advertised amateur radio sets for ten dollars in Pittsburgh newspapers . Home 's Department Store had set up a demonstration receiver in the store , which led to great sales success . Some of the lessons of these events were not lost on Westinghouse , Conrad 's employer , which had been looking for a way to enter the wireless business . Accordingly , Westinghouse began operating a station in East Pittsburgh on November 2 , 1920 . Westinghouse 's objective at that time was to sell nationally radio receivers that it would manufacture . KDKA , the station , was seen as an adjunct to the manufacturing enterprise . Even though from a contemporary perspective the economic potential of radio advertising was another lesson that could have been drawn from Conrad 's experience , the culture of early 1920s America would have viewed such an effort as an affront to privacy.4 Nevertheless , KDKA ushered in the 1920s radio boom . Westinghouse was not to play the dominant role in shaping the structure of American broadcasting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce from wire communications into a discrete market . Not until the end of World War II would wireless technology become important again in point-to-point communication . And while AT &T; attained the dominant position in wire communication , three networks presiding over a large number of affiliated radio stations would dominate radio , although not as fully as AT &T; controlled wire communications . Entertainment , broadly defined , would become the principal purpose of radio . Stations would be privately owned , in contrast to the European system of public ownership . The most important stations would be tied together into nationwide networks . Radio advertising would become the stations ' and networks ' principal source of revenue . While rate regulation became the most important government activity in the realm of wire communication , there would be no rate regulation in the radio market . Rather , licensing would become the crucial activity in that market . Radio and television broadcasting would grow into enormous businesses with vast audiences . All of these devel134 HOW AMERICA GOT ON-LINE opments occurred within the short period between h I ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption of the presidency in 1933 . And while many individuals played roles in shaping the exploding radio business , two were paramount : David Sarnoff and Herbert 1-loover . Sarnoff 's life is the quintessential rags-to-riches story . Born in a dismal Jewish ghetto in Russia in February 1891 , he emigrated to the United States in 1900 . Almost immediately Sarnoff began work selling Yiddish-language newspapers , while in his remaining time studying a variety of topics and mastering English . By 1906 , his father 's imminent death ended his education at the eighth-grade level and forced him to become the chief breadwinner for his family . An error Sarnoff made in applying for a job changed his life and the history of American wireless communication as well . Instead of applying for an office-boy job at a newspaper as he intended , Sarnoff mistakenly applied for similar employment at the Commercial Cable Company located in the same building . Offered a job , Sarnoff soon rose to become a Morse-code operator . After , moving to the American Marconi Company as an office boy , Sarnoff remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America , for more than sixty years.5 Sarnoff rose rapidly in American Marconi . His energy , his vision , and not least his friendship with Guglielmo Marconi assured this . As early as 1915 , when he was assistant traffic manager , he wrote , " I have in mind a plan of development which would make radio a household utility ' in the same sense as the piano or phonograph .... The receiver can be designed in the form of a simple radio music box ' and arranged for several different wave lengths . " 6 The Woodrow Wilson administration , which had seized control of radio during World War I , was anxious that an American firm , not a British subsidiary , should control radio in the United States . Hence it arranged for General Electric and other wireless patent holders to create RCA in 1919 , which in turn would purchase American Marconi from its British parent . When the broadcasting boom began it took the various RCA shareholder firms , including AT &T,; by surprise . When AT &T; disposed of its RCA stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , a complex battle between the two groups ensued . The end result was that AT &T; bowed out of radio in 1926 , selling its stations to RCA.7 At that point RCA was well on its way to constructing a network . The National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) was established in 1926 and reorganized into two semiautonomous networks ( Red and Blue ) in 1927 . By 1930 Westinghouse and General Electric had relinquished control of NBC and in 1932 , pursuant to an antitrust decree , it became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA . The Blue network was sold in 1943 under presTHE // sure from the Federal Communications Commission and was renamed the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) in 1945 . I'he final step in setting up the basic structure of the American broadcasting industry was the creation in 1927 of the Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS ) . Several stations excluded from the NBC networks , seeking syndicated programming that could fill their time , established the United Independent Broadcasters , which was then transformed into CBS . Just as Sarnoff dominated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he bought controlling interest in September 1928 . Not until 1977 did Paley step down as chief executive , having transformed CBS and its member stations into an enterprise incomparably more valuable than what he had paid fur the network and its directly owned stations . While Sarnoff had a larger vision of broadcasting and far more technical knowledge than Paley , the latter 's marketing strategies were extraordinarily innovative . Although A'I ' &T; had devised radio advertising in 1922 , when Paley took over CBS the network 's sales and techniques of advertising were greatly expanded so that it gradually became the principal source of network revenue.8 The most important focus of wireless communications by 1930 became AM broadcasting , and the American pattern differed sharply from that of other developed countries . The private ownership of competing networks and stations financed primarily by commercial advertising contrasted with the advertising-free publicly owned stations in other nations , where government subsidy and fees imposed on owners of radio sets ( and later television sets ) were the principal sources of revenue . Second , in contrast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of independent stations , some of which became linked together in networks smaller than ABC , CBS , and NBC . Third , although wireless was employed in safety , dispatch , and a few other specialized services , the dominant use was in commercial broadcasting . Fourth , the star system that had been developed in the movies was adopted in AM radio with great success ; millions of listeners week after week heard Jack Benny , Amos ' n ' Andy , and other stars ' shows . Fifth , as a result of telephone hookups and national advertising , the networks were able to successfully syndicate programs throughout the country . But one of the most interesting characteristics of American broadcasting occurred because the AT &T; model was rejected when that company withdrew from broadcasting.9 Perhaps the best way to understand AT &T's; concept of toll broadcasting is to compare wire communication and network broadcasting . In the former case , telephone companies distribute information ( including switched ) between communicating parties . The telephone company can not censor messages or determine who can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of fees and other moderate regulations . In contrast to telephone , radio transmission equipment was very expensive and could not be supplied to subscribers on the same basis . ' l'hus , unlike twoway telephone usage , the radio was one-way and effectively barred wouldbe users from transmitting what they wanted to communicate . They could receive messages because receiving equipment , even in the primitive stage of radio , was very cheap relative to transmitting equipment . Radio , from the perspective of one seeking to communicate with others , had only half the capability of wire telephony . Instead of intercommunication , broadcasting consisted of active transmission and dumb reception . Moreover , persons controlling transmission can effectively exclude anyone they want from providing messages or can censor what is transmitted . Toll broadcasting was intended to partly redress the differences between wire and wireless . Under toll broadcasting the station sold blocks of time to purchasers who could use it in any way they saw fit , subject , of course , to prevailing canons of decency . Nothing prevented the further subdivision of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisioned a network of local stations connected by long-distance wires so that the same program could be heard simultaneously in many places . But , unlike the present permanent system of affiliates , such networks could be constructed on an ad hoc or temporary basis . Finally , allocations of time would be reserved for public service and cultural programming . Toll broadcasting ended with AT &T's; withdrawal from the industry . Instead we have had a system in which stations and , most importantly , a few networks control not only the distribution of information but its content as well . Much of the current resentment against the media elite and their control of information might have been averted if toll broadcasting had taken hold . The network system that developed in AM radio continued when the VHF monochrome television boom began its takeoff after World War II . The three networks came to dominate the new medium , with a scattering of local stations offering less popular programming in many markets . And the same pattern persisted in color television after the F.C.C. ultimately resolved a bitter dispute between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which system would be employed , in the latter 's favor . Commercial color television broadcasting was authorized to begin in January 1954 . Sarnoff 's faith in color television was not , however , justified until 1964 , when at last color television sets began to sell in great numbers . From that time until the cable television explosion , the commercial system that Sarnoff envisioned from the advent of primitive commercial radio prevailed just as broadcasting , not point-to-point transmission , was the dominant use of wireless.t0 Ironically , as cellular telephony and cable television // grew dramatically , wireless became more widely used in point-to-point communication , while cable began to break the long-standing network dominance . lielore turning to the point-to-point wireless market , two additional markets should be briefly examined . FM radio and UHF television , different as they are , were both expected to challenge network dominance and reduce concentration in the broadcast industry . The story of FM is a very complex and detailed one . Major Edwin H. Armstrong , a brilliant engineer and holder of many telecommunications patents , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Originally a close friend of Sarnoff , the two men became bitter enemies as Sarnoff perceived FM as a threat to the network system that had evolved . t t In 1945 , reversing a prewar decision on where to locate the FM broadcasting band , the F.C.C. effectively wiped out the market for FM sets already made ; the FM industry had to start from scratch . Coupled with network focus on AM and television and a lack of programs , FM stagnated until 1957 , when at last the industry gradually took off . Not only do the three major networks provide service , but other successful networks have thrived as well . UHF television 's story has not been as fortuitous . Plagued by generally poorer reception than the VHF band , III IF was unable to make major inroads in the market notwithstanding a 1963 law requiring all television receivers made thereafter to be able to receive both VHF and UHF channels . Because of UHF 's poorer reception , it had generally not been able to obtain popular programming . The rise of cable systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has aided UHF prosperity.12 The Rise of Spectrum Regulation As the foregoing section shows , entertainment became the dominant use of wireless transmission after the radio boom began in the 1920s . But it was not the only use . Ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore use for safety and navigational purposes preceded the employment of radio frequencies for entertainment . World War I triggered military applications , most importantly the United States Navy 's deployment of radiotelephonic communications for quick and flexible strategic and tactical decisions . That war was the first in which aviation played a major role . At the request of the U.S. Army Signal Corps , the Western Electric division of AT &T; began work on the aviation radio problem in 1916 . In July 1917 Western Electric was able to develop the first air-to-ground and ground-to-air transmissions ( about two miles ) , and in August it successfully tested two-way communication between planes in flight . These wartime developments would have obvious peace138 HOW AMERICA GOT ON LINE time applications , especially in commercial aviation and ocean shipping and travel . The next important application occurred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island and the California mainland at Long Beach . Under normal circumstances , AT &T; would have laid cable over this relatively short distance , but wartime conditions created a severe shortage of the requisite materials . Thus , for the first time wireless became a direct rival to wire . Notably , AT &T; by that time had made substantial progress on the security issue to assure the privacy of point-to-point communication.13 The 1920s radio explosion coupled with the other uses found for wireless transmission and the likelihood that yet more would be found placed the issue of allocating the scarce resource of spectrum high on the agenda . Allocation through regulation was the method chosen as early as the 1912 Radio Act , when broadcasting was unknown and safety at sea was Congress 's primary focus . Under that statute the secretary of commerce and labor ( later secretary of commerce ) was given authority to issue licenses . After the broadcasting boom began , Secretary Herbert Hoover frantically tried to deal with the rampant interference problem , but was essentially prevented from doing so by a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding that under the 1912 act , the secretary lacked power to refuse a license to an otherwise qualified applicant , regardless of the interference created . Fruitless attempts at voluntary allocation and other Commerce Depal tinent court losses wreaked havoc in the system as more and more stations went on the air , using any frequencies and power they chose , regardless of interference.l4 Hoover 's efforts bore fruit in the form of the Radio Act of 1927 , which created the five-member Federal Radio Commission ( FRC ) . The act provided that the agency could grant federal licenses to individuals or business organizations for limited periods of time . The statute 's test for a license award or renewal was whether the applicant 's service ( in both the technical and nontechnical senses ) would serve " the public interest , convenience and necessity . " Thus , the federal government surreptitiously got into the business of assessing content and effectively censoring speech dangerous precedents in a free society and in complete contrast to the greater freedom of the print media . Wireless , in contrast to wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore rates were not regulated . The agency was also granted the powers to classify stations and prescribe the services to be provided by each class , and to assign frequencies , power , operating hours , and location . The licensing system created in the Radio Act carried over to the Communications Act of 1934 , which absorbed the telephone functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the FRC 's wireless regulation , thus establishing a unified agency with // regulatory powers over all means of communications.15 fictive leaving the subject of radio regulation and the establishment of the I " RC and the F.C.C. , it is useful to compare alternative paths that might have been taken to the one constructed in 1927 ( and even earlier , if one considers Secretary Hoover 's previous attempts ) . Continuing government licensing is based on the spectrum-scarcity principle ; only government can be the umpire . But a landmark article in 1959 by R.H. Coase clearly shows that even at the time of the 1927 Radio Act there was an alternative.16 Coase argued that , prior to the act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property rights for spectra in the same way they had created property rights for tangible property ( such as land ) and representational property ( such as stock certificates and negotiable instruments ) . Had the government followed that route instead of licensing coupled with regulation , it would have auctioned off spectra in such a way that interference would have largely been avoided . A market would then have been created in spectra in the same way that land or stock certificates are subject to market operations . Coase belittled the viewpoint that spectra are physically limited in a way that land is not . After all , he asserted , the number of original Rembrandt paintings is even more limited , yet the market satisfactorily deals with their sale and use without a need for government regulation . He similarly rejected the interference argument , since one person 's use of land would interfere with another 's proposed use of that same land if a property system did not exist . Indeed , one of the major functions of the private legal system is to devise rules regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has devised is property rights protecting exclusive use . Precisely the same principle could have been employed in the novel case of spectra during the 1920s . Coase and others who accept this argument have concluded that a system of auctioning off spectra would have been far more efficient than a government regulatory apparatus . First , of course , there is the deadweight loss attributable to regulation and the apparatus designed to enforce it . Second , the danger of government censorship and arbitrariness is always present when an agency has broad discretionary authority . More important , a market system with property principles would lead to more efficient use of spectra , according to this view . But that was not the path taken . The F.C.C. , carrying on the work of the FRC , began early to allocate the radio spectrum . The process is a complex one . First , engineering issues must be addressed . Standards are devised for different frequency bands , the number of channels each will contain , their bandwidths , geographical locations , and power . The political part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated purposes . In this part // of the process , the F.C.C. traditionally used a comparative hearing in which applicants provided evidence that reflected favorably on them , pursuant to the broad " public interest " standard . They could also provide information about an opponent 's adverse factors . ' ? As the 1930s proceeded the F.C.C. allocated frequencies for the so-called fixed services , including those concerned with safety ( aviation , fire , police , forestry conservation , and so on ) , land transportation ( automobile emergency , highway truck , railroad , taxicab , and so on ) , and industrial services ( forestry , petroleum , power , motion picture , and so on ) . Finally , the F.C.C. allocated frequencies for amateurs ' and citizens ' uses . By 1954 the agency could justifiably claim that " usage now extends from the cradle to the grave . There are radio facilities for calling doctors and ambulances to the homes of expectant mothers . . . . At the omega of life , radio is utilized to dispatch vehicles in connection with death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the period immediately preceding saw research that greatly enlarged the usable spectra . As we saw in Chapter 3 , the use of microwave transmission ( frequencies from 1 GHz to 30 GHz ) greatly expanded the available spectra and undermined AT &T's; position . Such frequencies increase the communications capacity ( bandwidth , or the rate at which information can be exchanged between two points in an analog network ) . As we saw in the Above 890 Mc decisions , the F.C.C. adopted a newly liberalized licensing policy for private microwave systems , rejecting the AT &T; argument that such licenses should be granted only in exceptional cases . Virtually every big-business interest was , for the first time , arrayed against AT &T; and the other common carriers , demanding the " free choice " to operate their private microwave systems . For example , the Automobile Manufacturers Association urgently claimed that " the highly competitive nature of the automobile industry makes it mandatory that privately operated systems be considered in comparison with common carrier charges . " 19 Such arguments prevailed and the opportunities of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually expanded . In turn , as we have seen , this led to the applications of MCI and others to provide microwave service to customers , gradually leading to the offering of full-scale alternative long-distance services . Wireless transmission for point-to-point communication was on the road to becoming as important as it was in broadcasting . The assumption that microwave would dominate long distance and find increasing application in local loops underlay policymaking in the AT &T; // Modification of Final Judgment and many F.C.C. decisions . In the case of local-loop communications , there were two reasons . First , microwave required no rights-of-way , a major problem in urban areas . Second , microwave was the most flexible way to add new communications points in the least me . More generally , digital technology was being applied to microwave ; indeed , one study indicated that digital microwave transmission had " exploded " in the six years prior to 1983.20 Digital transmission essentially ed microwave of the major problems with which analog transmission as associated , including cross talk and inconsistent signal level noise . moreover , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with analog because of lower terminal equipment costs . For these reasons , the F.C.C. commented in a 1973 proceeding that " digital modulated systems should be the rule rather than the exception . " 21 Accordingly , the ascendancy of digital microwave was widely conceived as inevitable . From digital microwave 's introduction in the mid-1970s until the AT &T; breakup , it triggered rapid deployment of microwave . For examc , in the five years preceding 1980 , use of terrestrial microwave in the United States tripled from approximately 165,000 to 500,000 installed miles , with other industrialized nations experiencing similar growth.22 Two important policy implications were presumed to flow from microwave 's ascendance . First , as economist Leonard Waverman argued in 1975 , the advent of microwave as a long-distance transmission medium dramatically altered the industry 's economics , so that the natural-monopoly justification for AT &T's; long-distance monopoly no longer existed as it had when open wire pairs were the principal medium for intercity traffic , which was the case until the late 1940s . Accordingly , he urged in an influential paper , increased competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly was the inevitable consequence of this view . Second , at the time of the breakup the fear that microwave would allow large business subscribers to bypass the local loop was widespread . A 1984 Fortune article summarily conveys what was then the conventional wisdom : " Bypassing , which promises to grow fast and large , will mean reduced growth and diminished profitability for the local phone companies . Much of their revenue comes from a few large clients . . . . If several large customers set up bypass networks , profits are penalized because phone companies usually can not cut costs as quickly as bypassing siphons off revenues . " 24 Lower local rates for large customers and higher access charges from longdistance companies to local telephone companies were conceived as the most effective response to the threat , which would inexorably take its toll on the local operating companies . In order to evaluate the impact of the alleged threat , it is initially impor142 HOW AMERICA GOT ON LINE tant to distinguish between two kinds of bypass . The first is facility bypass , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bypass vendor that connects the user directly to a long-distance carrier 's point of presence . Service bypass involves users purchasing private lines from the local operating company . In facility bypass the customer is completely lost to the local carrier , but in service bypass use of which has been much greater than the former ? the operating company still obtains considerable revenue from the customer . Operating companies have compensated for the loss by raising network access fees to residential subscribers.25 Aiding local operating companies , access charges that long-distance carriers must pay them amounted to about 40 percent of long-distance costs in 1991 . By 1995 access charges accounted for almost $30 billion of local carriers ' $115 billion revenues . Further , service bypass and special rates for dedicated lines have enabled local operating companies to counter ? or at least blunt the bypass threat.26 Nevertheless , the bypass threat is a real one and likely to get worse as personal communications services , at which we look later , and other technologies come on line later in the 1990s . To date , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomsayers and prognosticators were suggesting in the immediate post-AT &T-breakup; era . The past is , however , not necessarily a guide to the future for two reasons . First , bypass has , indeed , been increasing . For example , even though AT &T's; long-distance revenues decreased between 1984 and 1990 , from $34.9 billion to $33.9 billion , the access charges it paid declined at a much greater rate , from $20.6 billion to $12.2 billion . The erosion continues as long-distance carriers encourage the growth of local bypass carriers.27 More importantly , the sound quality and reliability of wireless technologies have improved , and digital technologies will accelerate further improvements . At the same time , consumers have become more comfortable using wireless technologies . Typically in telecommunications , then , there are significant threats to wire communications , but the expectation that microwave would constitute the major one turned out to be wrong . What then is the future of microwave transmission ? First , some entrepreneurs have rediscovered microwave and are devising new technologies to deploy portions of the microwave spectrum competitively . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitters that use the 18 GHz to 19 GHz band to transmit video , Internet , and data information . While its transmitter-receivers are fixed on buildings and must be in sight of each other , the equipment is relatively inexpensive to install and provides excellent data-transmission capability . Second , several telephone companies , instead of building expensive cable television systems to compete with cable providers , have acquired so-called wireless cable companies that use microwave frequencies to broadcast a limited // number of ' television channels over the air . Third , cellular radio companies often use microwave radios in short-haul applications . Fourth , because of microwave 's reliability in disaster situations , it is commonly used as a backup system when the wire system goes down . Fifth , in situations where fiber-optic cable can not be laid down or is extremely expensive , microwave is a typical substitute . Finally , short-haul digital microwave can provide superior transmission quality and reliability to large users than T1 transmisswn lines ( lines that carry digital signals at a rate of 1.544 megabits per second ) under some circumstances.28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Electric Modification of Final Judgment was based has not come to fruition . By late 1994 , 95 percent of AT &T's; traffic was carried by fiber-optic cable . From the time of the consent decree forward , the wireless growth sector was cellular telephones . The Cellular Revolution World War II accelerated the development of wireless transmission . Motorola developed two wireless transmission devices ? the Handie-Talkie and the Walkie-Talkie ? that facilitated military communication , most importantly on the battlefield . Millions of veterans saw firsthand the effectiveness of wireless communications and many would-be entrepreneurs envisioned civilian uses . AT &T; received regulatory approval to operate a Comimercial radiotelephone service in 1946 . The service was fully subscribed quickly , and within one year similar systems were available in twenty-five other cities . But the central problem with land mobile systems was far too little spectrum available for the large number of potential users . In 1984 less than one-tenth of one percent of all motor vehicles was equipped with mobile telephone service , and the quality of that service was very poor . In New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications simultaneously.29 Like citizens band ( CB ) radio , the insurmountable problem with traditional mobile telephone was that a large number of users had to share a small number of frequencies . The solution to the problem , like so many in the telecommunications field , was developed at Bell Labs . What triggered the development was the observation that television stations often used the same frequencies but were situated far enough apart to avoid or greatly reduce signal interference . The same principle might be used in much smaller areas for mobile telephony . In 1947 work began on cellular radio . In 1960 H.J. Shulte and W.A. Cornell , two Bell Laboratory scientists , proposed the first cellular concept , which notwithstanding increasing technological complexity still provides the basic cellular model . In their concept a metropolitan area is covered by // adjacent hexagonal cells so that the entire region is included . The available mobile telephone channels are divided into groups , with each group assigned to specific cells . The same group of channels can he used in different cells if the cells are separated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each cell is tolerable . Further , more channels can be assigned to higher-traffic cells.30 The breakthrough can best be understood by contrasting older mobile radio systems to the newer cellular radio ( also called cellular telephone ) system . As we saw , mobile radio was first employed in ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship transmission . By 1920 mobile radio was adapted for use in land vehicles and was used in police and public safety work . Spectrum shortage and the sheer bulkiness of the equipment largely precluded its use for other purposes . The World War II technological breakthroughs led AT &T; to propose the commercial mobile radio system in 1946 . The initial system was deployed in St. Louis , Missouri , but available technology limited the experiment to three one-way channels . The units employed a push-to-talk switch with all calls routed through a mobile operator . Because only three channels were available , subscribers had to have the patience of Job to get on line . Nevertheless , waiting lists to use the service were very long.31 Improvements occurred in the service to meet the enormous demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by authorizing the new class of radio common carriers ( RCCs ) to compete with the established telephone companies on a different set of frequencies . By 1956 demand for the service led the F.C.C. to authorize seventeen more channels for the mobile telephone service . Technological developments in the 1960s allowed a customer to use any available frequency that might be unoccupied , thereby greatly reducing waiting time . In the same period the new " Improved Mobile Telephone Service " ( IMTS ) allowed automatic dialing without operator assistance and conventional two-way telephone conversation without the need to push a button . Increasing demand compelled the F.C.C. to allocate considerably more bandwidth to the mobile service in the mid-1970s . Nevertheless , as conventional mobile radio 's day was coming to a close , the consensual view was that it had provided an inferior service . " At the end of 1983 there were only 12 channels in New York City to be shared by 730 radio-phone subscribers , with a waiting list of at least 2,000 . Even the lucky 730 often had long waits for a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callers sometimes sounded as if they were at the bottom of a well . " 32 The traditional mobile phone service was based on a system in which the signals transmitted were strong enough to interfere with others . Therefore , just as in conventional radio , channels assigned to one area could not be // used in nearby ones , sharply limiting the number of channels and , therefore , subscribers . In a metropolitan area all signals are transmitted to a central antenna . In contrast , under the cellular concept , a metropolitan area is divided into small areas called cells ? each with antennae and switching centers . Although any one frequency within a cell could handle only one call , the same frequency could be used for a different call in another cell because there is no interference between calls in different cells using the same frequency . Transmitters are very low powered and sufficiently distant from ' h other . Further , cells can be divided when call volume at any site bemes very heavy . A highly sophisticated switching system , handing off ills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the cellular caller moves from cell to cell . As a caller moves along roads , the cellular system continuously monitors signal strength and direction . This allows a computer at the central switching office , with which the equipment at each cell is connected , to switch the call to another channel or cell or both . The cellular system allows the ' transmission of data as well , but in that case an add-on device is necessary to prevent loss of data during a handoff.33 Both businesses and individuals grasped cellular 's possibilities immediately . For businesses it transformed travel time into work time ; cellular telephony , in short , became a major productivity tool . A widely publicized AT &T; study on a matched sample of salespeople , half with cellular phones and half without , showed that the group with phones averaged $11,000 more in sales per year than the group without them . Ameritech , through its mobile phone subsidiary , began commercial cellular service in Illinois on October 13 , 1983 . In 1984 there were approximately 100,000 cellular subscribers . we years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that spectacular growth paled before the increases from 5.3 million in 1990 to 23.2 million in 1994 , with the expectation that the number would reach 46.9 million in 2000.34 The only dark spot was that in the 1990s subscribers were on average making fewer calls . Finally , cellular 's spectacular record was not just an American phenomenon . Cellular use was rapidly expanding everywhere , most dramatically in Latin America and Southeast Asia . As one would expect , the battle to enter this lucrative arena , whose growth was foreseen at the outset , was a particularly intensive one . On the demand side , at the outset prices of equipment and service initially precluded widespread use . But as early as 1988 prices had dropped to levels that most analysts had not expected to occur until much later . As Business Week summarized , " Cellular phones already are becoming a shelf item for mass retailers . " 35 Economies of scale and widespread foreign-equipment competition contributed to the decline . At the same time newer entrepreneurial companies , like McCaw Cellular , developed novel marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a bounty to retailers who signed up customers f'or cellular service . Universally held early expectations of a booming industry had not only been met ; they had been surpassed . The F.C.C. 's early responses to the booming industry were criticized in some quarters , but an examination of how the agency shaped the structure of the industry indicates that the actions taken were at least plausible , and arguably better ( or not worse ) than alternatives not taken . Under the 1934 Communications Act , the agency was empowered to make spectrum allocations for a new technology and to construct a licensing system to determine which applicants would be awarded franchises . The F.C.C. was also empowered to impose technical standards for the equipment employed and how such transmitters and receivers are used . While the United States Supreme Court had admonished the F.C.C. that competition is the general preference in the use of wireless frequencies ( in contrast to the preference then , but not requirement , for monopoly in traditional telephone service ) , the shape and nature of that competition was in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were complicated during the period that cellular policy was being considered by three other factors . The first is the advent of cable television and the beginnings of the traditional breakdown between wire and wireless service , with the former governed by public utility principles . The F.C.C. , as we shall see in Chapter 9 , was getting mixed signals from courts on how to treat cable . Second , during much of the period in which cellular 's fate was being decided , the more important issue of the ultimate structure of the Bell system was pending in federal district court . That the F.C.C. took a long time to make a final determination and that it changed course should not come as a surprise when we take into account the complexity and the stakes involved . Third , add to this the fact that every state public utility commission could play a role in the eventual outcomes . Because many states had regulated traditional mobile telephone service , the reasonable assumption was that they would assert jurisdiction over cellular . As we saw , the cellular concept was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formal publication of the basic ideas occurred in 1960 . By 1970 two Bell Labs scientists had developed computer models of dynamic channel assignment . In 1971 further refinements were made in the engineering of channel assignment . AT &T; continued its research into cellular problems through the 1970s . AT &T; was , of course , anxious to exploit commercially the new technology that its Bell Labs had developed as soon as it became feasible . Accordingly , as early as 1970 AT &T; proposed building the first high-capacity cellular system , which it called Advanced Mobile Phone Service ( AMPS ) . AT &T's; proposal was submitted to the F.C.C. in // 1971 . AT &T's; submission was , in part , a response to the F.C.C. 's 1968 invitation to develop an " efficient high capacity " mobile system that would alleviate the worsening congestion taking place under the older system.37 In I970 the F.C.C. authorized AT &T; to test the system in Newark and Philadelphia , two densely populated cities with considerable traffic . In 1971 Bell abs reported that the new system worked very effectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allocated 40 MHz to it , ding that it would require cellular systems to be compatible . In this way ors would be able to roam from city to city and customers would continue use their sets regardless of location.38 In its 1974 order the F.C.C. limited the awards of cellular licenses solely o telephone companies on the grounds that cellular was an adjunct to gular telephone service and that AT &T; had incurred virtually all of the cvelopment costs . Further , the agency concluded that only telephone cornanies had the technological prowess to resolve the complex installation nd operation problems . A court of appeals in 1976 upheld the F.C.C. 's ccision to limit the new technology to wireline carriers . Between 1974 and 1979 the F.C.C. , adopting a cautious approach , granted construction permits in a number of cities . Meanwhile , developments in other countries were moving more rapidly . Japan instituted a cellular system in the Tokyo metropolitan region in December 1979 , while L.M. Ericsson , a Swedish equipent manufacturer , deployed major cellular systems in the Scandinavian countries shortly afterward.39 The standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The F.C.C. 's long-awaited decision was issued in 1981 after examining an enormous volume of findings and considering the views of numerous participants and commentators . Taking into account the argument made against a wireline company monopoly in each market that such a structure would thwart cellular development and eventual competition with conventional telephone service , the agency decided to award two franchises in each market . As we noted , the F.C.C. allocated 40 MHz of spectrum to cellular radio . Because technology then precluded splitting the allocation into less than 20 MI iz blocks , only two systems could effectively operate in each market . One company would be a separated subsidiary of a telephone company operating to the area , while the " nonwireline " franchise would be awarded to one among competing applicants . Finally , since the telephone company franchise would be able to operate before the nonwireline carrier , the F.C.C. would consider delaying the head start.40 In order to move quickly , AT &T; and GTE agreed not to compete with each other in the license awards , allocating markets between them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such market division wherever feasible . // The next major event affecting the structure of the cellular market was the AT &T; breakup on January 1 , 1984 , leading to the issue of whether AT &T; or the new Bell operating companies should run wireline cellular service . Since a fundamental division in the settlement was between local service and all other services , cellular communication was obviously on the local side . Consequently , the seven RBOCs inherited the AT &T; wireline cellular subsidiaries . Nevertheless , the overlap between the RBOC territories and the market areas in which the cellular carriers would operate was far from congruent . For example , northern New Jersey is part of the New York metropolitan area , but the area is divided between two different RBOCs . Accordingly , Judge Greene 's approval was required in such situations ? a process that delayed operations for a considerable time after applications were made . But the new RBOCs went further . Since as we have seen the general expectation was that the cellular market would grow rapidly , and each RBOC was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring nonwireline cellular carriers outside their areas , which was permissible under the consent decree.41 The final issue at which we look is the method by which the F.C.C. would award the nonwireline franchises . The agency had traditionally used a comparative-hearing method in wireless situations ? most importantly the award of local radio and television station licenses . Under this system the F.C.C. examines comparative financial data , experience , technological facility , and other factors in determining winners . This process has three major drawbacks . First , it delays awards that are contested by several applicants for a considerable time . Second , such proceedings are often so lengthy and complex that enormous resources are expended on lawyers , experts , and so on , rather than on the service itself . Third , the procedure discourages smaller start-up firms and those willing to take risks . Who , after all , is willing to enter a battle against a huge company with extensive technological experience and resources ? But it was primarily the first drawback that led the F.C.C. to abandon the notion , envisioned in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important 1984 ruling , the agency adopted a lottery method for nonwireline carriers.42 Since the competent and incompetent had equal chances to win the lottery in any market , the method led to an explosion in the number of applicants . Some successful applicants had no intention of entering the cellular business and promptly turned around and sold their franchises for enormous profits . One successful applicant that retained its franchises would radically alter the conception of cellular telephony. // McCaw Cellular and the Growth of Hypercommunications In our look at the early development of the Bell system we saw the gradual shift of telecommunication from isolated local markets to transcontinental long distance . Theodore Vail 's vision and leadership triggered this dramatic change and the technological improvements that it demanded . In more recent times , the conception of telecommunications has become global . When cellular telephony began it was primarily conceived as local in nature . But Just as Vail broadened horizons in wire communications , Craig McCaw , who led McCaw Cellular Communications from its infancy until its acquisition by AT &T,; was one of the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in telecommunications . His father founded Centralia , Washington 's , first radio station in 1937 and began operating one of the nation 's first cable television systems in 1952 . Until his death in 1969 , John E. McCaw bought , sold , and operated numerous radio and television properties . In 1966 John McCaw began Craig 's communications career by selling Craig and his three brothers the Centralia cable franchise for no cash , taking back preferred stock . Craig was then sixteen years old . Young McCaw successfully operated the cable television system , but in 1981 the company 's revenues were about $5 million ? a far cry from the $11.5 billion that AT &T; paid to acquire McCaw Cellular in the deal that concluded in September 1994 . McCaw 's interest in cellular radio was piqued when he read in 1981 an AT &T; filing with the F.C.C. that projected 900,000 cellular subscribers by 2000 ? a figure that , of course , turned out to be absurdly low.43 When the F.C.C. began its process of awarding cellular franchises , McCaw was awarded licenses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only the beginning . McCaw undertook a huge buying spree between 1983 and 1987 , largely financed by borrowed money and the sale of the cable television properties . Debt in 1989 approached 87 percent of capital ? an extraordinarily high figure . But McCaw Cellular continued buying and selling cellular franchises . In that year McCaw Cellular outbid BellSouth for a controlling interest in Lin Broadcasting , a major cellular operator with licenses in Dallas , Houston , Los Angeles , and New York . Behind the buying and selling , McCaw had a strategy to completely transform the cellular telephone industry from one with a local focus to a national network . Its operations were shaped in the form of market clusters that were intended to eventually form a national wireless network in the same way that AT &T; had been gradually transformed from local systems into a national wireline network earlier in
