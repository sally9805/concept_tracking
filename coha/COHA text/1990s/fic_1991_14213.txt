An empty , run-down locker room in an unused boxing arena in a small industrial city in Tennessee . Peeling plaster , water stains . Portions of the ceiling bubble ominously . One door with a twist lock leads in from an outside hallway . One door leads into a shower room the delicate would avoid . One door stands open revealing a broom closet partially filled with rotten , rolled up Venetian blinds and a decaying mop and bucket . Along the walls of the room stand lockers of two distinct periods . A ceiling fixture with three naked bulbs provides most of the illumination . Above the lockers there are posters ranging back to the 1950s naming fighters an aficionado might recognize . Some , mold has obliterated , some have inexplicably survived . The floor is littered with beer cans , Coke cups , newspapers and nasty drek . Several lockers stand open , revealing their own distressing mess . A small man in his forties walks past the door . A moment . He returns and stands framed in the doorway looking in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Geez , I do n't know ( A woman 's voice is heard in the outside hall . ) TIGER Anybody home ?
