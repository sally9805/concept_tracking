Gambling has been considered the lifeblood of Las Vegas ever since the Nevada Legislature legalized it in 1931 . But the real lifeblood is water . Water for the falls and fountains that dominate hotel lobbies . Water for the lagoons that surround housing developments . Water for the lush golf course fairways and greens . Water to harness the electricity that powers the air conditioners and ice machines that cool the gaming patrons who spend the money that pays for life in such an extravagant playground . The water here , as is the case throughout most of the arid West , is supplied by the Colorado River , the seventh longest river in the United States . More specifically , Las Vegas 's water needs are satisfied by nearby Lake Mead , a Colorado River impoundment created by the 726-foot-high Hoover Dam , the Western Hemisphere 's highest concrete dam , a structure capable of holding back two years ' worth of river flow . If all Lake Mead did was supply about 4 billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year , few people would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally important as a source of recreation , supporting sailboating , yachting , houseboating , water skiing , and personal watercraft use , as well as full-service lakeside marinas , swimming , and fishing by all manner of boating enthusiasts . Camping and sunbathing are major pasttimes too , and sites for such land-based recreation are increased in times of drought when the water level is low . Bare and desolate cactus country surrounds this lake , which stretches for roughly 110 miles when full , with 822 miles of shoreline snaking around red cliff canyons , coves , and various hideaway basins where sometimes the only eyes watching you cast are those of a bighorn sheep . The lake forks on its upper reaches ; one branch is called the Overton Arm , and the other is the Colorado River . All of this is part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area . Lake Mead and its downstream sister , Lake Mohave , originally known as Boulder Dam National Recreation Area , constitute the first national recreation area established by an act of Congress . Above the dam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bounty includes striped bass , largemouth bass , catfish , crappies , and bluegills . It also includes carp  --  so many that in the summer , one of the more bizarre local attractions is the hundreds of carp that gather at the Boulder Beach marina , gunting for bread and swimming over each other 's backs to chase crumbs . Despite the amount of attention the carp receive , however , most of the angling interest is focused on striped bass , which were introduced in 1968 . At one time Mead was noted for large shipers , and although the occasional 30-plus-pound giant is still taken , the current population is comprised of an enormous number of small fish , which provide superb action at times . During the warmer months schools of stripers are active early and late in the day , which is considerate since midday temperatures routinely soar above 100 degrees at this time . On a good August outing , a party of striped bass anglers have typically caught their fish by 9 A.M. and are headed off the water . Lake Mead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing- well these days thanks to brush-planting efforts . One of Mead 's deficiencies is steep shorelines , clear water , and very little cover , which makes the use of jigs and jigging spoons very popular . Brush , largemouth bass , cigarette-type powerboats , baccarat tables , one-armed bandits , a sphinx-shaped building  --  none of this could have been imagined by the Colorado River 's early explorers . Nor could they have imagined Colorado River water powering a desert town that never sleeps and cities as far off as the California Coast , or even a time at the close of the 20th century when demand would exceed supply . This is lifeblood water , all right . MORE THAN MEAD Below Hoover Dam , the Colorado River carves its way through the Black Canyon for about 11 miles , departing Nevada from Arizona , and heads toward Lake Mohave and the Davis Dam , a total of 67 miles from Hoover .

He says that fishing for largemouth bass on Mead usually picks up in March when fish move into the coves in preparation for spawning . Many lures , including spinnerbaits , jigs , and swimming plugs , work then . " By June , " says Thompson , " bass have moved to deeper water , and you have to fish mostly along canyon walls using worms and jigs . " Some surface action is possible at first light . For stripers , Thompson says that many techniques produce small fish . Bait fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good from July to November . <p>
