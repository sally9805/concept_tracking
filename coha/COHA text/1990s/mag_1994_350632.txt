The Academy Award for Best Actor goes to . . . Jim Varney in The Beverly Hillbillies . Best Picture . . . Hot Shots ! Part Deux . Seems unlikely , but the trade papers are running full-page ads of this sort , bugling almost every movie made this year . It 's a seasonal thing , like the flu , and will pass once the Feb. 9 nominations are made public . Till then , the big winners will be the ad-fattened trades .
