You know that El Nino 's wild winds last winter left a path of death and destruction . But do you know why ? Our expert explains . Photograph El Nino took the blame for tornadoes in Sanford , Fla .... Photograph .. a bitter , powerrobbing ice storm across Maine ... // For nearly a year the news media made dire predictions about the dangers of El Nino , a wild weather-maker from the sea that would wreak havoc across the world . Unfortunately , much of it came true . Many regions around the world suffered the terrible impact of the strongest El Nino on record . In America , parts of California slid into the ocean from mudslides caused by heavy rains . Horrific tornadoes blasted across Florida , Alabama and Tennessee . Ice storms of unusual ferocity smothered Maine . Oddly , other areas experienced pleasant weather . From Oklahoma to North Dakota , spring flowers peeked through the brown , winter grass . Then everything reversed . Weather on the West Coast turned nice while a wild winter storm dumped more than five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arctic air slipped south to Texas and Georgia . What in the World Is Going On ? ! To most people , such weather may seem wild and strange . For a television meteorologist like me , though , El Nino is business as usual with a simple explanation . And here it is : El Nino and its little sister , La Nina , which will affect us this fall , have been around for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . Their names mean male child and female child in Spanish . But these children of the sea pack an adultsize punch . It all starts in the ocean . See illustration at right . El Nino happens when the eastern Pacific Ocean waters along the Equator become at least one-half degree Celsius ( almost 1 degree Fahrenheit ) warmer than normal . Energy , in the form of moisture and heat , rises from the oceans to the atmosphere , becoming the power that changes wind patterns and storm strength . The warmer waters slowly spread eastward , pushing weather patterns eastward too . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alley-instead smash downtown Nashville , Tenn . Torrential rain that usually falls harmlessly into the Gulf of Mexico instead floods central Florida . During La Nina , cold waters stabilize the air above it . Stable air does not rise and clouds do not form . But the energy remains tremendous . Photograph .. and deadly floods in Elba , Ala. , and across the United States .

Right , Drought-sparked fires in Mexico block the Texas sun in June . // El Nino occurs about every two to seven years . La Nina-the cooling of the ocean waters , which results in similarly strange weather-occurs about half as often . Pacific waters began cooling this past summer , and La Nina 's impact is predicted to be felt as early as this fall . Power Play Why does the ocean go to so much trouble ? It 's all part of nature 's balancing act . Heat in one part of the world is counterbalanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods elsewhere . A big part of that balancing act is an event like El Nino . So , there is not a big mystery about El Nino and La Nina . They arise from the sea , affect the atmosphere and change the direction and severity of storms that roll across our earth every day . Then they quietly slip away , only to return again another day .
