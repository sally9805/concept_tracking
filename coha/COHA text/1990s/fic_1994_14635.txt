Scene one . In the darkness we hear a vampiric voice : I picked up the band of totality  --  blessed darkness !  --  in the Gulf of Mexico and proceeded North into the wilds of Texas after it . The band stretched some 211 miles wide and prolonged itself North-North-East at some 350 yards per second , with me for a companion . Within a few hours I would be directly overhead the fabulous cities of Northeastern America . Lights up slowly . We see a long , dark MAN 'S white face in the sky . Below him is the dimly lit surface of what appears to be a dinner table , covered with a white table-cloth . ( Actually , we are seven miles up in the air , and the table is the island of Manhattan . ) He smiles and makes a welcoming gesture with one hand , also very white . Pause . DRACULA My name is Moral Shadow Witherspoon and my family is an old one , older I sometimes think than even the figure of Adam . That clinched nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyphonous pagany , that eremite gasbag  --  Jehovah the Monotheist . I shall not trouble you with my own personal story . Aside from which , it has slipped my mind . Ca n't recall it . I am an aristocrat . Being an aristocrat carries with it a certain hat . And certain other hats . Then there is the improvement of the , um , species , which had better be left to those still bamboozled by the empty promise of the future , television , and the marking down of domestic comestibles , fur and all such like ; those capable of empathic fraud . To enter into the mind of another is crime , an act of breakage and entropy . So , there you have it , in a nutshell , the very pith of my philosophy , free of all cant . Pause.For , in truth , are n't we all complicit in this phantomnation ? You , and you , and you . All animated by the ferocious need to make impact on the surface of a strange planet that hovers beneath us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blur that hovers beneath our dancing feet . For once I journeyed among the wise , and spoke of Hegel , Harry Martin , the Master of the Yellow Parasol , and Maurice the Geek of Nones , who crept into the unlatched mail-box of the Protophotophagoi . All this is as clear to me as Rome was to Remus , as Tarsus to Paul . Pause.Why , you ask , why do you hold us , a sea of the unseeing , here , in thrall ? Why , indeed . There is an old saying that runs roughly thus I do not recall the saying , nor is it a particularly memorable one , but it very much cuts to the quick , it marks the spot , it blackens the spilled blood with the soot of appearence : " Your dog is in the sky . So is mine . " That dog forewarns us of the necessary idea , the concrete bailiwick of the emboldened , who are maddened by reference to things , special things . Great stupid , unarguable facts . Pause.I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , in my lord 's fastness of Ckm Ckm , I and my kind would feast upon the standard fare . Mamaliga . Potage of leeks and potatoes . Often a roast chicken done up curiously with paprika . The virulent paprikas of the Magyars . Pause.The taste for blood became fashionable only in the last century . At the apex of our true celebrity . In truth , I was never very fond of the stuff , and it is no small trick , even with pointy teeth , to pierce the skin and vein of a terrified , thrashing , human being and not make quite a mess of things in the doing . " Blood is the life , " indeed ! One might just as well proclaim : " A bucket of soapy water , a bloody towel and a mop are the life . " Definitely a disagreeable and totally unsanitary operation , totally out of character for one such as myself . An aristocrat . An aesthete . A classicist and lover of the tidy , even if viewed from an extreme Dionysian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we are on the subject of " taste , " permit me a small culinary digression . Not all bloods taste the same . Not to speak of nutritive value . Unless one is built , gastroenterologically speaking , along the lines of a leech , one is not likely to derive much in the way of sensual delectation from such a diet . It is true some bloods have a certain sweetness , a certain delicate aroma and savor , but these are rare . Young children and those fortunate enough to have enjoyed tranquil milk-and-honey , cornfed lives in sunny climes filled with laughter and azaleas . These are rare , and their blood is rare . Can you imagine the hideous reek of a sixty-year-old , gouty Englishman , grown fat on Scotch egg , broiled goose , and Yorkshire pudding ? Not to mention the unspeakable curries and grey , soggy vegetables of that realm . Port wine , the stench of cigars and indecipherable sweetmeats . Such blood ought to be thrown out with the contents of the chamber pot . Such blood contains about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drained out of automobiles during the ritual oil change . Extreme old age may be a factor in my distaste , but I was never really fond of the stuff . I was too much a conformist in my youth . A slave to fashion . Clearly there is much in my life I would like to forget . The sleeplessness of the vampire is a classic instance of the poetic entelechy of bad conscience . Pause.Actually , My true name is Aloysius Nancarrow Flowerpot , and I do not drink blood at all , but subsist on unsweetened lemonade and mashed potatoes . Cold mashed potatoes . Cold , wet , soggy , mashed potatoes . And these only to maintain bulk , and fluid level . Real undead nutrition is acquired by frequent doses of an invisible ether discovered originally in our ancient homeland of Kush , but re-discovered since on every continent but one , Antarctica . This invisible ether is available commercially under the trademark name of " Swank . " Informally , we always refer to it as " geezer " gas , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considered as an obsessive , hypertrophic thought-machine , caught up in the endless loop of remorse , recrimination , and the nameless archaic dread that is incurred upon contemplation of happiness among the young , and otherwise unafflicted . " Geezer " gas allows us to bridge the gap between appearance and apparence . Between hard fate , and a more romantic destiny . In a word , the inhalation of " geezer " gas allows us to have our cake and bite it , too . If the living knew our secret they would elect us to public office and worship us like the rich . For we are much alike , and we pass among them , undetected . Much as they pass among us , undetected . Pause.For a long time I have been an ardent traveller . I arrived in this country after a long voyage on the steamer , Paducah , out of Charleston . I played the part of an eccentric European gentleman with a fondness for cryptic parables , off-color jokes , and an unusual and deep knowledge of lunar eclipses , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ability to recall amazingly precise details from , say , a pleasant October evening , near twilight , say , on a sea-side villa on the Golden Horn in the Year of Our Lord 802 caused , first , skepticism , then a certain pall of uncanniness among the crew and my acquaintances among the passenger list . I would lay , wrapped in a tartan quilt , curled up in apparent ease , on the sundeck , occasionally playing checkers with Williams , chess with Wu , or faro with Father Wallace of the Roman Catholic Church . And this despite the strength I possessed to lift the ship out of the sea , and fling the entire hulk from horizon to horizon without raising so much as a bead of sweat upon my strange , withered brow . I thought a long time about friends from shadowy times , dead languages , the odds against discovering the meaning of love , worn sandals , broken headstones , cast-off items of clothing such as singleton socks , and the slow ectotopy of old hats , hats from the era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talleyrand and Thermidor . Hats from Constantinople . Hats from the days of the Paleologi . Hats from Paphlagonia . Hittite and Assyrian hats . Clasps . Thorns . Buckles . Thread . Tacks . Needles . Blades . Boxes of black pearls and broken teeth . Delicate bones of small animals . Pause.My real name is Royal Treatment Doodad , and although I and my kind are , yes , derived from the ancient nobility of Kush , by way of the Carpathians , in truth , we appeared on this continent , suddenly , by means of time 's Worm-Hole , which deposited us , I mean we  --  in the sense of " I "  --  suddenly one day in the summer of 1936 on a dusty sidewalk in Sioux City , Iowa . I found myself sprawled out , in the garb of a Fuller Brush Man . A battered wicker suitcase containing samples lay beside me in the dustbowl dirt . A straw hat , presumably mine also , spun like a child 's top on the diametric axis of its brim . Three years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of the finest grazing land , the finest house on the finest street , was the nominee of the Republican Party for Governor , was betrothed to the prettiest girl in town , the Mayor 's daughter , and kept my coin stacked neatly in a little , walnut chest , inscribed in mystic runes from ancient Kush . No one had guessed my secret . I was safe . A hidden geyser of " geezer " gas in the nearby Callithumpian Mountains sated my unholy hunger . No one noticed my craving for cold mashed potatoes and unsweetened lemonade . Indeed , these peculiarities of my diet were deemed virtuous instances of sober moderation in the wilderness of the monster beefsteak and the howling conboberation attendant upon enormous consumption of rye whiskey . My bitey nature , however , could not contain itself . Tooth must do the work of tooth . It is nature , working through us , even though we fall up or down , through time 's Worm-Hole , in myriad disguises of identity . Even if , when we go in search of ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient tomcat transmogrified to a pincushion . Pause.So , as the man of the world , Royal Treatment Doodad , I prospered mostly . I bit , but little . Bit only when I must , and only to hurt and harm , never to draw blood , particularly not Siouxian City blood , which was very poor and ratchety , being curdled by too much bleach , bible reading , and square dancing . I do , however , admit I bit upon the neck , hard , of my fiancee , Penelope Angelsfood Birdswater , daughter of Clyde Birdswater , the Mayor of Sioux City ; for which act I was unceremoniously tarred and feathered , and run out of town on a rail ; yes , although these things are true , they are only trivially true , and not adamantly true . As they ought to be . The lack of that adamant is my mitigating modality . Pause.Further , the precise circumstance of that mitigating circumstance was the obvious truism that before I took up the habit of biting , and began to bite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throat . A purely innocent pause.So : I am an innocent . The last in a series of thought-objects percolated untimely from the cosmic mire . I am merely engaged in perfecting my nature , which is to bite , digress , imbibe " geezer " gas , eat cold mashed potatoes , drink the most insipid of lemonades and flap about , high in the foetid skies of the tri-state area , New York and New Jersey mainly , looking for a creature , far below , to bite . Pause.Among my favorite pastimes is the systematic scrutiny and collation of certain of the more remarkable instances of partial or complete obscuring , with relation to a designated draculan observer , of one celestial body by another . I collect eclipses . Among my most favorite eclipses are the following : the Ghost lunar of Felix . AD 303 or 4 . About the time of the martyrdom of St. Felix . The Happy . Pause.My other favorites : A fine , lunar eclipse in the year 969 in Iraq . Tabit , son of Sinan , saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thursday , the 14th of Rajab , at Babylon . Tabit is mistaken : the eclipse occurred on Friday , at around midnight . Several centuries later , I picked up a marvelous annular eclipse in the Pacific Ocean just north of Easter Island . Flapping madly only a few hundred yards above the wine-dark sea I followed to a point half-way across New Mexico , where both eclipse and me  --  the image of myself , that is  --  were recorded by an Anasazi craftsman in a set of petroglyphs . This was on the fifth of April , 1102 AD . The boulder bearing these petroglyphs has unfortunately been lost . It lies buried under a heap of worthless rubble near the old Three Rivers service station at us 54 north of Tularosa . Pause.More recent eclipses have been , by and large , disappointing , mere echoes of a grander music that is past , and shall be no more . He slowly fades from view as the lights come up on WILHEMINA MURRAY , the first of her two vampiric selves . She now leads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thinking . You are thinking she is dead . Dead and yet not so . How pitiable . How sad . To be plucked from her respectable life , and her respectable engagement with that fine young solicitor , Jonathan Harker , and her fine , solid , respectable , predictable nineteenth century . Plucked like an unripe fig , before her time . I confess I would not undo my dark turn from the merely human for a wilderness of monkeys . Think on that : for a wilderness of mon-monkeys . Think on that : for a wilderness of monkeys . She laughs oddly.True , the good Count has gone gaga , true . True , the impulse to feed has ruled out some of the refinements thought essential to more or less civilized behavior . True , I have become , more or less , a monster of appetite , strapped to the wheel of my hot , carnal need . But even before my turn , is it not a fact that this is how the fine , noble , Nineteenth Century regarded me ? Become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become what I seemed , seemed to those who saw in my innocence only spite , only appetite . But now I do the biting . For I must . Pause.Sometimes I feel as though I had been swimming in time , as though it were a clear fluid . A palpable substance , both hindering and supporting one 's motor control . Decades like waves in the ocean , beating upon a shore that is the Inconceivable . The rush of meaningless events , wars , atrocities , the useless obsession with dates , facts , and slightly prurient information concerning one 's neighbors . The hideous redundancy of fashion , with its vapid and supercilious alternation of hats , ideas , shoes , and highflown rhetoric . Its shabby conceits . The sanctimonious pursuit of what is called " truth " by the parsimonious inheritors of wealth , power , privilege or other idiotic additive tropisms . Lust for the finite . The endless mediocre puppet show of apparent choice versus apparent error . The cruel slaughter of innocence in the name of stupidity , and even innocence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muck , at the bottom of the sea . Pause.For in truth we do inhabit a world of blur , a world of vague , insubstantial entities , and this is apparent once one has had the nerve to harden oneself a bit , and examine what passes for reality with a little critical with a little skepticism . All the hubbub of the Moving World amounts to mere perturbation , a slightly exasperating surface tension vertically rendered on the horizontal face of a small , insignificant pond that is quietly freezing over . Pause.Wilhelmina . Mina . Strange , I do not seem able to recall my own last name . My patronymic . The name of my father . Who was my father , for in truth I possess none , now that I am vlkoslak , undead , one of the High Ladies of Ckm Ckm . A world adrift inhabited by evil cats and evil cockatoos the color of pure ionization . Butterflies with razor wings . Gigantic palaces of time-mottled chert and schist , draculan towers of adamant , floating above the streaming rubble of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty Time out of antique celestas and barrel organs . Vlkoslak , vampire . A world like a child 's spinning top , spinning so rapidly as to appear quite motionless . A world beyond the palaver of easy comprehension . Pause.All my life I worked diligently , within the moral framework of the time , to record and systematize experience , perceptual data as I was familiar with it , all with some mad dream of a secular paradise shortly to come . All of us , in that lacquered world of Victorian omnisciencia , saw in ourselves the culmination of thirty centuries ' blind struggle for total mastery , accomplishment , and the achievement of a unifying theoretical framework . I suppose this was a noble refraction . I suppose it gave my life purpose , along with the law which provided sense and realism to my fiance 's life . Poor , sad Jonathan , he is a shadow now , an echo of an echo , moving like a crow 's shadow among wisps and merds of a wasteland in the old world of blur . Pause.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become , how resistant and resilient a thing the soul is once one has deleted the " human " component . But the feeling is of an enormous transcendental lift . As though one had suddenly acquired truly human dimension after centuries of dull , insipid sub-human existence in the carapace of a bug or beetle . For it is a thing gone truly mad that spins our child 's top , and stops only to hear the wind creep in the wheat , wriggle on the apple bough , and sizzle in the reeds , as it inscribes its riddle on the blank stone rock faces of the Hebrides , in the cold clutch of the horrid seas , for none to unravel and read . Pause.An enormous transcendental lift , yes . Still I confess I do miss the odd flow and convection of hot winds you call " politics " even though I am not partial to what are termed " contracts , " " litigation , " " settlements , " " negotiation " and the like , or other forms of compromise . Prattle pays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stationary World we have no need for this . And not for a wilderness of monkeys would I change places with the most high among you . You , and you , and you . You , my former friends and playmates . You , my former confidants , friends , countrymen . The stuff of my affable , companionable food . Pause.An enormous transcendental lift , yes . The nature of that lift we call the " draculan , " and the change it causes in Simple Time  --  Simple Human Time  --  simpleton mediocre time is , frankly , tremendous . Our time is Time Turned , Draculan Time . A dradical redaction of time 's tune to our vampiric exigency . These ripples signify the snake of time 's force , the Snake Time wriggling and worming its way through the obdurate oppression of perceived reality . At least as it comes to be exemplified in your world . The world of food . We of the Stationary World , consist in an order you could not fathom . This , I suspect , is why names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary labels , and flutter off . To be a " Mina " means no more or less to me than " anima . " My personal nomenclature redacts a fritillary of the far away . An anima of otherworldliness arrayed in a fair figure , as you behold , above you to image the draculan . Pause.If you would bounce a child 's ball in our world , that ball would go on bouncing forever unless stopped by some intervening force . But to deduce from this peculiarity of our draculan physics some implication of a merely mortal consistency would be foolish . Our fine , dear Count here , who styles himself " Deville " to wow the ladies in Picadilly Circus , this bloodless avatar of the draculan , has given it to be known that he subsists on cold mashed potatoes and an odd etheric substance known as " geezer " gas . Ha ! But nothing causes me such gastronomical thrill as the eating of plump , white housecats . You would be amazed how many unappetizing objects resemble the plump , white housecat when viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a cool and windy , moonlit night . When one is hungry , the urge to metaphysical speculation must be put aside , for a time , so that we satisfy the most low of our creaturely cravings . Pause.But there is nothing like a brace of plump , white housecats , freshly killed along with a magnum of the finest champagne . Nothing . Nothing can measure up to it . This vile drug called " Swank " is only used by those addicted to a conception of the past as conditioned totally by inane tribal confabulations . But massive doses of the stuff simply appall the mind , not to mention one 's aesthetic center of gravity . Moderation in all things rules the day , even in the realm of the draculan , ruled by the law of wriggle . Pause.When I was a little girl , and had not yet been bitten , I suppose I might have felt no I suppose things might have turned out differently . I suppose the person I was then , if she had known , might have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at whom of who  --  of who I am now . I know I possessed seven very frilly , white crinoline dresses , absolute horrors of the creaking fashion of the time  --  which I quite enjoyed . And a little brass rabbit , a creature modelled on some idiotic children 's book , which I would play with , and cause to hop about , thus . She demonstrates.To hop about , thus . Hop about thus and so to my unstinting amusement . Can you imagine ! A thing of brass modelled into the shape of a mere rabbit . A toy some two or three inches in height , which I would cause to hop about on the window sill , of a green and gold summer 's day . How far away have my elongations taken me , how far , far , far . Hop and hop and Pause.But this vast , indescribable metropolis , always brings me back to now . This non-rabbity New York . Non-rabbity now , where I must burrow and tunnel my way through the most loathsome filth and offal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housecat . Yes . This New York . This non-rabbity New York . For while I love to soar and glide for long periods of time at a great height above the metropolis , as I am now , in truth most of my time is spent burrowing and tunnelling beneath the asphalt crust , in the dark primordial interstices of her nether world , as a sort of fabulous draculan mole . My chronic chthonic excavations have taken me deep into the city 's forgetfulness . I have come to know the true secret history of your olden times . Slit throats , gunshot wounds , random hackings and blunt stabs , the bodied consequence of long , unimpeded descents down elevator shafts and factory staircases . Arson , barbarous suppression of strikes and riots , oppression and wicked crimes against orphans , widows , Africans and the North American red man . I find odd bits of evidence that chronicle both the howls and demented fury of the luckless , and the disingenuous boast of the saved . Broken eyeglasses of twisty wire , bent scissors , scraps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnt mattress , a rimless black hat , a brass clasp , tweezers , shoelaces from a time now lost . A broken clay pipe squenched with a plug of char . Suddenly an awkward pause.Astarte . Azrael . Avant garde . I think I shall slide behind the moon for a time in order to become another person . A person more to your liking . Perhaps you will indulge me in this phantom whim , the significance of which I shall enlarge upon when I reappear . Shortly . I shall return presently . Entertain yourselves as you will . The moon is bright , and the night is fair I promise to return with a delicious surprise Astarte . Azrael . Avant garde . Pause . Cheesy " wampyr " music . House lights on . All stage effects cease as she walks offstage , or behind a screen . After a brief time she reappears , the SECOND MINA that is ( her draculan inner self ) . She has a applied ghastly make-up . Snaps her fingers , and we return to the skies above New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am different . I am the same , but different . Pause.Although the truth is , I was not the one who bit : I was bitten . Not that I have any problem with who I am , Nope , not me . And my teeth hurt . Biting is hard on teeth , and I 'm no spring chicken , I know . Maybe I 'll have to stop eating housecats . Maybe eating housecats has ruined my teeth . Would you get a load of my teeth . Big Choppers . I used to have these dainty , white , pearly teeth . The kind moonstruck poets used to write about . But after my " turn , " that 's a miserable euphemism for being bitten  --  after my turn my teeth got big and nasty . Maybe I 'll have to give up eating plump , white housecats . Really is a disgusting habit , if you think about it . Maybe I 'll just give up eating tomcats . Tomcats really are rancid . They disgust even me . I 'm not without compunctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from seven miles up on a cold and partly-cloudy moonlit night . You can just barely make them out because the earth gives off a faint , preternatural glow . As though it were alive . Giordano Bruno thought the world was alive . They burnt him at the stake in February I6oo in Rome . I was there , in the C mpo di Fiori , in I6oo . The " Field of Flowers " in English . It was a fairly cold day . A day like one of Giotto 's frescoes . The reality of it bursting from newly wrought lines of mathematical perspective . I thought I saw the Pope , Clement VIII , but it probably was n't him . Anyhow , I watched Bruno sizzle . I was glad they roasted him . The heretic . He knew too much . People who know too much all ought to burn . He said the earth moves because it is alive . That 's enough for me . Burn the heretic . Freedom of speech for those who can afford it , and those who watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , since being who I am , with these big monster teeth , I nose about in places most people do n't even know exist , and therefore have no conception of . Reality 's not holding up so well . Cause and effect are coming apart . Time 's Worm has a bad case of being hypnotized , like the chicken , by the long white stripe in the middle of the road . Pause.Still , there is tradition . Obligation . Duty . All those time-worn cliches . Charity . Blah-blah . Social imagination . Social conscience . Sensitivity . She laughs drily.Think about sensitivity when you 've got a full set of ivory gondolas in your mouth . A smile that will not refrain . Because none of the High Lords and Ladies of Ckm Ckm had any clue as to the true , pathetic essence of time 's tangle of twine . Nor the unrelenting terror of its rope-a-dope . Nor the incredible paucity of places of escape : emerald isles looted by our fiducial superiors , gleaming desert panoplies swarmed upon by larval spiritual shipwrecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the majestic polymodality of the skies now retains only a backlit semblance of its former significance , a waking nightmare for air-traffic controllers . All of it , gone rabbity . Rancid . The wheels and levers of falsehood all too in evidence just beyond the meadow of green velours , and the crude mechanical show of the cloud and wind machines , flapping , flapping , flap . Pause.Time passes , and there are certain things which I reflect upon , and which thus considered give me a certain pleasure . My favorite book of medicine is the Kiranides , from the twelfth century , which contains a recipe for a LICINIUM or combustible compound in whose light those present will appear to one another like flaming demons . Or , in book two , where the reader is instructed that wearing the dried tongue of a weasel inside his socks will close the mouths of his enemies . The last , smallest , and most elegant of my favorite things is to lead the Little-Leaf Beetle  --  slowly  --  all the way , all the way to Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am different . I am the same , but different The two VAMPIRES sing a little Song:The devil has beautiful skin.She ties her face in a bow.She knots the bow to her knees.Then she tears up the Picture and paints her face again.The devil has beautiful skin . The devil has beautiful skin.First she grows fat , Then she grows thin.Then she tears up the picture and paints her face again.The devil has beautiful skin . Your dog is in the sky . So is mine.What a great first line . Too bad there are no others . Both fade as lights come up on the third vampire , LUCY WESTENRA. p. 5 LUCY WESTENRA Chew this over . In the beginning there was the act of biting . I am called " Lucy Westenra " but in truth I am child only of the act of biting , and to this act , and its delectable repetition , I bow and pay homage ; I do think I am the happiest girl who ever trod the surface of the Moving World , or put tooth to vein , or flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What masticates incarnadines . What chews transcends the blues and unbottles the Djinn of oral delights . So , when I overhear my dreary brethren , high above Central Park as we sail high and low in vast bloody loops , where no one has the wit to spy , I can not resist a cry for sheer hilarity . She cries out.People are so afraid of death . But believe me , there is nothing they are more afraid of than a young girl , who is very pretty , very wanton , and knows what exactly she wants . Particularly , when she is dead . Certainly I have no recollection of being bitten by the good Count " Deville . " We sat on the stone chair high on the East cliff over-looking the whole harbor of Whitby , and he talked of some strange gas , and of the " guisers , " strange old men and children , who would inhale the stuff , and put on strange , corny masks and perform in bad plays . He smelled of sauerkraut and paprika , and seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , suggested he was a celebrated personage from an obscure region in Central Europe , the Carpathian mountains , I believe , rich as Croesus , and that therefore I should be receptive . Rubbish , I thought . Why is it a girl undergoes such a peculiar transformation from the decided hellion that , at age ten , can beat up any boy on the block , play football , and do large sums in her head to boot : fearless , reckless , outspoken , cheerful and quick to action ; when by sixteen she is smothered in cliches of domesticity , ribbons and bows , afraid of spiders ? Cautious . Simpering . A thing dependent on the whims of others , and happy most when cowering in shadows . Pause.So : the gothic traditions of the vampiric have no appeal to me . I happen from moment to moment and have no use for fixed conceptions of myself . But then I do n't place much reliance on what people say or do . What they do is usually a perfect horror in pure performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing . It all boils down to the same , sad song-and-dance . Masks and realism , sincerity , lectures . This is the way to do this , that is the way to do that . Habits posing as precepts . Repetition upon repetition of the too , too familiar as some kind of brake upon what might overwhelm . Since I find frailty and fragility the stuff of timeless clichs , I have little patience for what passes for innocence . Occasionally I move with great , shocking celerity , if only to cause a refreshing response . Animals and sea creatures behave pretty much like human beings , but are somehow better at it because perhaps they do n't always try too hard . Birds used to amuse me because they too fly , and their thoughts are usually more elegant , or at least more concise , than those of bipeds , or quadrupeds like cats and dogs , and other Americans .

Full of noses , gaudy stuff , people of all hues , characters attached to the sad filth of their lives , money , cheeses , rats , a few wolves , unspeakable neckties , unreadable books on this and that . All of them relate to a central organism they call the state  --  by a long sad , spiritual membrane . A resting place of their odd faith . To grasp , emphatically , at a sunset as though it were a utensil . To measure one 's reach by lacks ; what one desires , but lacks . As though the moon were a footstool to kneel upon in self-regard , while the thing of wonderment roars , and roars , and wings it outside . Do n't chew on this for all I care . What is stabbed by tusk knows fate 's no nicety of wriggle . Those that loved me died unloved because I choose not to release one small radical root from a hypothetical quadratic .

Yet to pin down the draculan disremembers its furry edge , and grows a hatful of spikes , thorns , and scotch tape branched into colorless , translucent roses . Who cares if the nightmare you dreamt up to torment your enemies is only a fluid poured down a drain ? Who cares if no one loves you anymore ? What did THEY ever know , the beloveds ? Did the two of you ever speak the same moral language ? Did they ever obey you when you made the universal sign of indication over their round , expectant faces ? Did they ever memorize the deep truths you told them when they were heartsick , and took to bed , fearing the worst , with the multitude of their dollars stacked up for the doctors and lawyers who steal hope in the name of the republic ?

Why , if all that I recall of my people makes me loathe both them and me , why , why should I not dare to aspire to the frauds who use their shapes in the obscene parodies ? And do n't the parodies themselves suggest something we would just as soon forget about transcendence itself ? And we knew the full horror . And we did not know . And we were moved , and we felt nothing . And we heard the music and thought it din . And we were deaf . And we were glad we were deaf . The monster who disguises your daughter like one you would spear with golf clubs has his eye on your car . The one who doubts the riddle of turbulence will find her house riven by molecular derision . The one who stumped your daddy on your granddaddy 's knee is watching from the mailbox where she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you she had for all the others and you know you do n't know . And you know if you admit the fact your goose is cooked . Your goose is truly cooked because you have n't a clue whose bed you 've been sleeping in , nor with whom , nor whose insane laughter accompanies whose strange coughing , fits and delirium , out of doors , on the street , this very night , twenty years after Fate passed you by . Pause.But I am getting ahead of myself . This high up you hear nothing from below ; that is the point I was making with my draculan digression . The optick on the city is transposed , forensically , under the rubric of the edible . Below , spread out in rapturous , jazz-age neon and the glitter of a martini silverado , lies the city of New York . Fabulous . High flyers like ourselves . High rollers in the gaming clubs . Bottom dwellers in the news rooms and faculty dining houses . The abject pruners of the flock , leaning against street lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on safety . Bankers and profiteers spewing forth the electronic , hieroglyphic papyrus of princely camouflage , all sharing in a sense the same hyperpsychodermic needle . Manufacturers and purveyors of thought-objects strutting their wares . It is a need to prey that so incessantly needles needles some to madness , awful woes and bellowing , and some other , happy few , notably me , to my sustaining updraft , my hilarity . I look down through veil upon veil of wispy vapor and behold a city of food . Pause.The glowing metropolis . Is n't it beautiful ? Is n't it truly fabulous ? Indeed , the entire tri-state area makes my mouth water , Which is the prime mover for my gladness . We are reputed to stem , in tribal terms , from the last of the fallen angels . But the true crime of Those Who Fell was not rebellion , but joyousness and bright waggery . The other side , our foes , believed in order , starch , and the grimmest of grim decorum . Obedience . Little stars on the forehead for proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward-focussed gaze . Pause.For the devil , you may recall , was a little fellow , a child of brightness , hilarity , and pure investigation . This led him to certain oral pleasures deemed unseemly by the management . Hence his-and our-sudden removal from the attic of heaven . Our version has it that we left of our own accord , and they ( above ) would have us back in a minute . Our direct ancestor was the last to fall , according to heavenly legend . Our oldest saying says : " One fell and swoop ! " Never touched the ground-that is , the floor of the fiery pit , hell itself-but flew far away , over the forests , lakes , and abysses of the known world , past the glittering facade of the ice mountains to a place in central Asia , ancient Kush . Pause.Ah , but to look down the long line that extends from the tip of one 's draculan nose , down the elegant vector of immaculate rectilinearity , down to the city of one 's food , city of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mandibular excitation ; that is happiness-that is happiness exponentially enlarged . Pause.Happiness is the truest artifice . Happiness is doubt in the face of the supposed . Happiness is the refusal to take seriously what one ought Happiness is a squirt of squid 's ink in the baptismal fount of the shit-named . Happiness is a pocketful of marbles , a rain of belly-buttons in the empty stadium of the team that moved away . Happiness is the arc of error , repeated till it rings true . Happiness is the coffin lid , closed for all time . Pause.All the letters of the alphabet are footprints of demons who arrived here millennia ago disguised as lemons , arrayed in spectral starlight . Seeing themselves , naked , they dispersed . Some of them are hidden among you , happy . One of them fell . Rose to high rank . I am she . I glow , O is O and nothing more . Demons inhabit the intersection of circles , as we do . We recognize each other , in the unholy starburst of our secret LICINIUM , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming metropolis , by our incurable happiness and our inclination to bite , bite . Pause . Reprise of the Song.The devil has beautiful skin , etc. p. 6 DRACULA Enough . Enough of this chatter . Look below . Can you spy what I spy ? Geezer gas . Hands binoculars to MINA . She looks , roars . She hands binoculars to LUCY , who also roars . WILHEMINA MURRAY See , below , the lumpy and unwary DRAMATURGO , loitering like a fine white housecat . SECOND MINA Like a fine , white housecat . By the stagedoor of the Public theater . She roars . DRACULA Geezer Gas . He swoops . LUCY WESTENRA Let us swoop down and descend in a fit of perpendicular prolongation . Let us descend in a fit of pure bliss . All swoop and are gone . We hear a scream from far below . Slow black .                                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @
