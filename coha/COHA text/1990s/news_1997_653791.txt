<p> Choi Jae Hyun came to the bank today carrying a small plastic bag containing American pennies and quarters , Canadian dollars , Malaysian ringgit and Chinese yuan . He and his colleagues at work had taken up a collection of the change and small bills left over from their overseas trips and sent Mr. Choi to exchange them for Korean won . <p> " We wanted to help the economy , " said Mr. Choi , who works at a telecommunications company . Although he acknowledged that his small bag would barely make a dent in raising the $66 billion in foreign currency that Korea needs to pay its short-term foreign debt , he said that if everyone contributed a little , it would amount to a lot . <p> Meanwhile , Korean voters began casting ballots for a President , hoping a change of leadership will provide new answers to the economic crisis . Page A16 . <p> Taking Mr. Choi 's message to heart , Koreans have responded to their nation 's economic crisis with a large outpouring of tiny gestures . Mothers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally receive as presents when they are 100 days old  --  the Government buys the gold in won at the going world price . <p> The gold is then used by industry , cutting back on the amount that Korea has to purchase from abroad using scarce dollars . <p> The outpouring is a touching show of patriotism and a return to the grit and determination that helped the nation overcome colonization , civil war and poverty to grow into the world 's 11th-largest economy . <p> The only problem , some economists say , is that some of the measures might only make the economic crisis worse by cutting back spending and worsening the contraction already under way . <p> Koreans are not only turning in foreign currency and gold , they are also cutting back on consumption of all kinds , but particularly of imported luxury products , which are perceived as contributing to the foreign debt problem that necessitated this month 's $57 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund . <p> Asiana Airlines of South Korea , for example , has stopped serving beverages on its domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only food prepared in Korea on international flights . Television broadcasters will reduce programming by two hours and substitute Korean shows for American programs . <p> To Koreans , these steps just make intuitive sense . " Running a nation 's economy and running a household are the same , I believe , " said Yoon Byoung Joon , who runs a noodle shop in one of Seoul 's underground pedestrian ways . " When you owe someone money you have to tighten your belt and cut your spending . " <p> But some analysts say the austerity campaign not only wo n't help Korea 's economy much , it will actually send it into a deeper tailspin . <p> " It 's totally inappropriate , " said Stephen E. Marvin , head of research at the Ssangyong Investment and Securities Company . With Korea 's manufacturers already suffering from excess capacity , cutting consumption " will just result in more companies going bankrupt . " <p> Cutting back on purchases of Jeeps and Gucci bags also will not make much of a dent in Korea 's trade deficit , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of South Korean imports , and most of that is food , not frills . The bulk of Korea 's imports are fuel , raw materials and components and machinery for its factories . <p> Moreover , analysts say , Korean consumers , far from being spendthrifts , have a high savings rate . " If there was excess consumption , it was in the industrial side not the consumer side , " said Henry G. Morris , head of research at Coryo Securities , referring to companies that built new factories recklessly . <p> The " buy Korea " campaign also shows signs of ugly xenophobia that could annoy the foreign investors and lenders upon whom Korea is depending to save its economy . <p> Recently , students at a girls high school in Seoul burned in effigy a man wearing foreign clothes . At Seoul 's Kimpo airport , Korean tourists traveling abroad have been heckled by demonstrators and searched by the police to see if they are carrying too much foreign currency out of the country . Anyone who spends more than $10,000 in a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their credit card suspended by the Government for use abroad . <p> The United States and Europe and their companies have long complained that the frugality campaign , which had been under way to a lesser extent even before the recent crisis , constitutes an unfair trade barrier . <p> American automobile companies , for instance , have complained that Koreans who buy imported cars are often subject to tax audits . The Korean Government denies this . <p> Now , however , with Korea so down on its luck , foreign companies and governments can not easily press their complaints without seeming totally inconsiderate . So the austerity campaigns are flourishing unchecked . <p> The movement is spearheaded by various citizens groups , which stage street campaigns calling for foreign currency to be collected and foreign products avoided . But the Korean government tacitly supports the austerity drive and in some cases actively encourages it . <p> In a society that generally prides itself on egalitarianism , anger is turning against " selfish " people who display conspicuous consumption . <p> Recently the public was outraged by news reports concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some wealthy homes in Seoul . The outrage was not directed at the thief but at the people who were hoarding so much foreign currency rather than contributing it to the nation 's coffers . <p> Another target is Korean students studying abroad . Even though their American educations might one day help improve their country , for now they are seen as spoiled kids draining foreign exchange . <p> " Tell the I.M.F . not to give the loans until all the students overseas have to give up their BMW 's , " said Kim Yong Hak , 57 , a recently laid-off security guard . Some students are now returning home as the weakening Korean won makes it too expensive for them to stay abroad . <p> The news media have contributed to the feeling here that Koreans have only themselves to blame for their nation 's demise . <p> " Excess consumption  --  our biggest crime , " screamed the headline on the front page of an economic newspaper . The English-language Korea Herald , meanwhile , said in an editorial that spending on weddings and funerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed much of the national wealth down the drain . " <p> Not all the apparent reduction in consumption of goods in general and foreign goods in particular can be attributed to the frugality campaign . Spending cutbacks might also result simply from worries about coming job losses and from the sharp depreciation of the won , which makes imported products and overseas travel more expensive for Koreans . <p> Indisputably , though , Korea in November reported the first surplus in its current account , the broadest measure of trade in goods and services , since December 1993 . The surplus resulted largely from falling imports and a decline in overseas travel . <p> And the move toward frugality is having some visible effects . Seoul 's notorious traffic jams have eased a bit as people take mass transit . Sales of some foreign cars are reported to have dropped to nearly zero . <p> At the Moa Liquor Bank , a store that specializes in $200 bottles of French Cognac and other imported spirits , sales are so " unbelievably bad " that " we are finding it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store manager , Lee Jung Hoan . And he said this before the store was forced to raise prices by 20 to 30 percent because of the depreciation of the won . <p> The Korea Exchange Bank , where Mr. Choi came today with his bag of foreign coins and bills , says it has collected a total of $191 million in foreign currency between November 20 , when its campaign started , and last Saturday . <p> Many more dollars , yen , pounds and marks came in this week . With the won having sunk so low , it was a good time to buy won with dollars . <p> The Government helped matters Tuesday by suspending the requirement that banks report foreign exchange transactions exceeding $20,000 . Koreans who were afraid that turning in their foreign currency would attract scrutiny from the tax office are now coming forward . <p> Not all of the money has been spare pocket change . People are opening foreign currency deposits . Koreans living overseas , and Korean-Americans as well , are wiring money after being exhorted to help save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heavy bags of coins . So far , the bank has shipped $100,000 worth , weighing seven tons , to a bank in Hong Kong , which then credits the Korea Exchange Bank 's account . <p> Counting , stacking and shipping all these coins is not a nickel and dime expense . After such expenses were deducted , Korea Exchange Bank netted about $50,000 for the $100,000 in coins it exported , said Park Hae Chung , manager of the business promotion and support division . <p> But the cost is almost beside the point , he said , when compared with the benefits of Koreans chipping in to save their country . " There 's a Korean saying , " he said , " that by gathering dust you can create a mountain . "
