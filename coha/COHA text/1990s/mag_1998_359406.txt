The struggle between the President and Kenneth Starr , framed until now as a legal-political showdown , seemed to boil down this week to a subtler but perhaps more basic dispute : the conflict between the Clintonites ' desire for something known as " closure " ( a New Age buzz word drawn from the vocabulary of family therapy ) and the cry from other quarters for what used to be called justice ( a term one associates more with the Old Testament ) . Indeed , if an alien were to view the tapes of Clinton 's recent TV defenders , he , she or it might be inclined to think that " closure " was a kind of magic spell whose mere invocation could bring redemption and peace . <P> Consider : when David Kendall , the President 's lawyer , appeared on the White House lawn on Monday following his client 's grand jury appearance , it was n't justice he called for in the matter , as defense attorneys normally do , but that other , warmer , fuzzier outcome . The subtext of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the President might prove harsher , colder and more damaging than simply putting the whole matter behind us , in the manner of a bad romance or a quarrel with noisy neighbors . A senior Administration official quoted in the New York Times sounded a similar note . " The American people , " the official said , " are not pounding on the door for details ; they 're pounding on the door for closure . " <P> Meaning Americans want what , exactly ? <P> Permission to forget ? Move on ? " Let go ? " <P> Judging by its current usage , closure appears to be to justice something like what NutraSweet is to sugar : a modern substitute with all the taste but none of the troubling calories . A term from psychology , not law , closure refers to a general sense of emotional completion about a matter , not to the formal righting of a moral or ethical imbalance . <P> When death-penalty supporters call for closure for murder victims ' families and champion their right to see the bad guy fry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a married couple in counseling finally splits , grievances aired , tears shed and hugs hugged , the closure reached , however final , does not guarantee an equable divorce . <P> Do closure and justice overlap ? Not necessarily . Should the President 's approval ratings reach 100% next week , it would certainly represent closure to the Lewinsky case , but it would n't also mean justice had been done  --  particularly if Starr 's report to Congress were to contain persuasive evidence of crimes . When Richard Nixon resigned over Watergate , that was closure too , it can be argued  --  but his pardon by Gerald Ford was viewed by many , even to this day , as an unsatisfactory moral ending . <P> For certain tolerant religious types , justice is the Lord 's , of course , not man 's , and closure may be the best we can get on this earth . And in his Monday evening speech , Clinton seemed to take this view himself . Call off the prosecutors , he said ; this is between my family and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show more mercy than Starr , or Starr 's jury , or Congress .
