History of Overseas Students in the United States <p> The United States of America has a long history of deliberately attracting students from overseas to its campuses , and of investigating the problems of such students . E.W. Schulken notes that " in colonial America ... the founders of ... New England colleges were motivated partly by a Messianic zeal which led them to view the purpose of American higher education in national and universal , as opposed to local or regional , terms . ... Then , as now , there seemed to be a motivation behind their concern for these ' foreign students ' which was deeper than that of simply providing an education . " 1 Indeed , one of the basic visions of the founders of Harvard was to include men from overseas among the student population . When the university was founded , it was expected that English Puritan families would send their sons to the colonies rather than expose them to the " prelacy " and " temptation to lewdness " prevalent at Oxford or Cambridge. 2 Schulken and I.T . Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into three periods : the domination by the foreign missionary movement , beginning shortly after the foundation of the Republic ; the domination by private philanthropy , from the period of the Spanish-American War ( 1898 ) to the early 1930s ; and the period of government involvement , from the 1930s to the present. 3 <p> Evidence suggests that students from the British West Indies , Canada and Mexico were studying in the U.S. as early as the 1780s. 4 During the nineteenth century , the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , through its activities in Asia , encouraged numbers of students to go to the U.S. for higher education . By the end of the century , however , missionary policy tended to favor establishing educational facilities in the foreign countries themselves , and this , together with emergent nationalism overseas , led to a decrease in the potential numbers of students from missionary sources . American foundations had also attracted students to the U.S. from China , Hawaii and Japan . Rutgers University was particulary active in recruiting Japanese students via missionary work in the 1860s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Japanese government policy to send students to the West , and from 1871 , the Japanese government financed many students for study in the U.S. 5 There were very few students from Africa in the late nineteenth century , but those who did study in the U.S. came almost exclusively via missionary sources . <p> Before the Tai-Ping Rebellion in China ( 1853-1864 ) , the Viceroy sent some forty students to the U.S. and Europe to learn Western science . In those days , however , allowing a son go abroad for an education was something that no Chinese family of any standing would condescend to do . Consequently , the students thus sent were from poor families and had hardly any education-some were even illiterate . Because of the students ' initial language difficulties and their lack of previous training , their years of residence abroad benefitted them little , except that they did learn to speak English with fluency . On their return , they were found to be ignorant of Chinese affairs , and some of them had even forgotten Chinese . P.G . Bourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they became alienated from the traditional culture and ineffectual in changing it . They lived marginal existences , espousing Western names and behavior patterns . " 6 The majority became merchants , and others entered the consular service. 7 <p> In 1871 , the missionary Yung Wing , the first Chinese to graduate in the U.S. ( in 1854 ) , secured the approval of the imperial government to send 120 Chinese boys to America for studies . In 1881 the program was stopped because the Chinese authorities believed that the students were becoming too westernized . After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 , however , China launched a modernization program in which these graduates played a major role , sending large numbers of students to the U.S. in the early years of the twentieth century . By 1906 , Chinese graduates returning home from studies abroad were permitted to take conversion examinations in English , which gave a great impetus to the study of Western languages in China. 8 By the early 1930s , China had become the U.S.A. 's " biggest customer " for Ph.D.s. 9 Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising of 1900 , the Western powers levied heavy indemnities against the Chinese government , and in the U.S. , some began to see this penalty as oppressive . In 1908 , a bill was passed which called for a " remission of a portion of the indemnity " by giving Chinese students an opportunity to study in the U.S. , and in 1909 , the first " Boxer indemnity " students arrived. 10 <p> After a study of foreign student problems in 1910 , the World 's Student Christian Federation created the Committee for Work among Foreign Students in America , later the Committee on Friendly Relations among Foreign Students , an agency of the Young Men 's Christian Association , which provided guidebooks for students and organized overseas students ' reception to the U.S. 11 Schulken writes that , " The foreign student was beginning to be regarded as a source of good will and international understanding rather than a potential recruit for the Christian Army . As well , there was a growing conviction that the only real answer to world peace lay in the widespread interchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the nineteenth century , private philanthropy took over where missionary zeal left off . <p> The turn of the century witnessed an increase in the number of students from Latin America , particularly in the wake of the 1903 revolution in Colombia . In 1919 , as a post-war gesture in the spirit of world peace , the Carnegie Corporation established the Institute of International Education in New York , encouraging young people from all over the world to come to the U.S. to study , and similarly , encouraging young Americans to travel overseas . Guidebooks for overseas students in the U.S. , as well as a regular bulletin , were produced by the Institute from the early 1920s onwards and the Institute 's Committee on Educational Interchange Policy issued a number of reports and papers on the welfare of overseas students . The Carnegie Corporation is only one example of several large philanthropic institutions which offered assistance to students from overseas to study in the U.S. Another of the major sources of fellowships for overseas study during the 1920s and 1930s was the International Education Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in New York , California and Illinois . The Phelps-Stokes Fund , which assisted African students ; the American-Scandinavian Foundation ; the Commonwealth Fund , which distributed Harkness Scholarships for citizens of the British Empire ; the Belgian-American Educational Foundation ; the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation , established particulary to assist Latin American students ; the Carl Schulz Memorial Foundation , established to encourage German-American student exchanges ; the Ford Foundation , and many others offered unprecedented opportunities for the movement of students in all branches of knowledge . Large sums of money were available from these endowments , and in the inter-war period , it was considered more than desirable that privately amassed fortunes should be used for purposes of encouraging and facilitating international educational exchange. 13 <p> The third phase in the management of overseas students was characterized by American government involvement . This involvement can be traced to the 1936 Convention for the Promotion of Inter-American Cultural Relations , which established programs in the U.S. for students from Latin America , and set the stage for a closer association of governmental foreign policy considerations with issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second World War , " increasingly the public looked to the federal government to provide programs of educational exchange . ... Behind much of the government 's activities , and the popular interest in them , was the feeling ... that wars can be ended if people can only come to know and understand one another . " 15 The Fulbright Commission Scholarships ( under the " Fulbright Act " of 1946 ) , funded by money from foreign governments raised from the sale of war supplies , and other scholarships under the 1948 Information and Educational Exchange ( " Smith-Mundt " ) Act , funded in U.S. dollars by congressional appropriation , provided the impetus for increased government assistance to international education , the commitment to which was assured by Point Four of President Truman 's foreign policy program outlined in his 1949 inaugural address : " I believe that we should make available to the peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life . " 16 Other legislation offering aid via education to specific countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolution on the Finnish War Debt , 1949 ; and the Iranian Trust Fund Act , 1950 . The Point Four spirit was clearly in the best traditions of the founders of America 's first universities during the colonial period . The concrete realization of this policy was the passing of the Act for International Development in 1950 , which granted funds for aid to developing countries . But in the U.S. of the McCarthy era , overseas students were still treated with a suspicion born of ignorance . R.F. Butts writes , " In an atmosphere of primitive loyalty oaths and attacks on the schools , even a study about other nations , especially Communist nations , was easily linked with advocacy of liberal or ' pinko ' views , if not with downright Communism and treason . " 17 <p> University research into the problems of foreign students during the 1950s , and a series of reports by The Ford Foundation and The Carnegie Foundation in 1960 , led to a number of legislative instruments which further promoted international educational exchange. 18 The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development ( A.I.D. ) , which has been responsible for bringing thousands of overseas students to the U.S. By the " Fulbright-Hays " Act of 1963 , " for the first time , the federal government officially recognized a responsibility not only for the roughly ten percent of foreign students sponsored by the government , but also for all foreign students in the United States . " 19 The International Education Act of 1966 provided extensive grants for overseas students and encouraged the establishment of courses in English as a foreign language . The National Defense Education Act of 1958 had sparked a revolution in foreign language teaching , and new teaching and testing methodologies had been developed . By 1966 , the teaching of English as a foreign language was a recognized profession , answering the perceived need of overseas students on American campuses . Socio-Cultural Models <p> Because of the large numbers of students from overseas studying at all levels throughout the U.S. , particularly since 1945 , researchers have searched for models of social acculturation , as well as for explanatory developmental models of overseas students ' attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Initially , the impetus appears to have been a desire to help students appreciate the American way of life , and to overcome any resistance to aspects of it that they found disagreeable or with which they had become disillusioned . Subsequently , researchers have tended to adopt an ethno-methodological perspective , concentrating on the phenomenon of living in an alien community and of adjusting to the sociocultural constraints that living overseas imposes , both from the point of view of the host community and from the point of view of the students themselves . <p> G.V. Coelho writes that " Education abroad is a major developmental and psychological transition in a foreign student 's life . Like other transitions , it represents a series of phases of high risk situations that produce emotional stress as well as opportunities for coping behavior. " 20 N. Goodman observed that attitudes toward foreign students in the host country , specifically the U.S. , influence teaching and the responses to the students ' problems . A developmental attitude is one which seeks to enhance the process of development of essential human capital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one in which the underlying agenda is the socialization of overseas ( Third World ) students to Western ideas , values , and tastes , and which views the students principally as foreign . The investigations undertaken in the U.S. , informed as they have been by advances in sociology and social administration , psychology , education , and linguistics , have provided us with some of our most powerful insights into the academic and sociocultural problems faced by different national and ethnic groups-European as well as non-European-which are coping with campus life in an English-speaking environment , and which have served as informing sources for much research into aspects of this topic elsewhere. 21 <p> Early discussions which highlighted potential problems of adjustment suffered by overseas students on American campuses 22 were followed by a considerable amount of post-war empirical research in the U.S. 23 Siu 's seminal paper , " The Sojourner , " ( 1952 ) described a study of Chinese laundrymen in the U.S. , whom he identified as " sojourners , " a " deviant type " of the sociological form of the stranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who clings to the culture of his own ethnic group , despite his physical presence in another community , . Psychologically , he is claimed to be unwilling to organize himself as a permanent resident and has no desire for full participation in the community life of the country of his sojourn . His activities tend to remain within the limits of fulfilling the job for which he finds himself in the alien community . ( The " sojourn " image is opposed to another common sociological stereotype : the " melting pot . " ) Siu specifically included " the foreign student " within the categories to which he applied the term " sojourner . " Siu writes , " On the basis of common interests and cultural heritage the sojourner tends to associate with people of his own ethnic group . ... The formation of the cultural colony reveals symbiotic segregation on the one hand , and social isolation on the other . " 25 This is not an uncommon phenomenon among overseas students in their host countries. 26 That the sojourner was identified as a " deviant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , total integration was considered the ideal . However , while most of Siu 's examples of sojourners ( the Chinese laundrymen as well as missionaries , diplomats and colonists ) were typically long-term residents of a foreign community , overseas students are generally not in this category , though they may share certain characteristics associated with the exemplars . <p> E.H . Jacobson ( 1963 ) identified a nine-phase sequence in a sojourner 's experience , viz. , ( i ) pre-departure preparation ; ( ii ) departure ; ( iii ) " enroute " ; ( iv ) entry into the area of sojourn ; ( v ) post-arrival orientation ; ( vi ) exploration ; ( vii ) tentative commitment ; ( viii ) ultimate commitment ; and ( ix ) adjustment. 27 Often , more notice is given to this last phase of the student 's experience on campus , and very little account is taken of the prior phases , which , indeed , may greatly influence the final one . The implication is that adjustment may be assisted , and problems avoided , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-arrival stages of a student 's sojourn. 28 <p> According to congruency theories of attitude organization , the principle of formation , maintenance and change of ideologies is consistency among relevant attitudes , and also between attitudes and an individual 's value system . It is postulated that a substantial part of attitudinal variance over time can be accounted for by acculturation in an alien environment. 29 One of the most common of the models of this process cited in the literature on overseas students ' adaptation and adjustment to their host countries was first proposed in two other early influential publications . The original adjustment model was the U-curve hypothesis. 30 According to Gullahorn et al. , " The acculturation process may be interpreted as a cycle of . . . socialization occurring under conditions where previous socialization offers varying degrees of facilitation and interference in the new learning context ... there is an initial excitement or elation over new ideas or skills ; feelings of depression and perhaps decrement in output as one encounters difficulties and complexities ; and finally , a sense of satisfaction and perhaps even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restructures the problem . so he can work effectively . " 31 <p> The early data presented by Sewell and Davidsen as well as by Lysgaard suggested three or four stages in " adjustment " : a favourable initial experience , an adjustment crisis and a readjustment , and the operation at increasingly more intimate levels of contact with the host community , i.e. , the hypothesis tends to emphasise satisfaction without explicit reference to expectation. 32 The initial , or ' spectator ' phase is , Sewell and Davidsen claimed , characterized by enthusiasm , fascination and novelty value . The first few weeks or months witness a transitional phase , involving a reorientation of attitudes as the " ' adventurous ' pleasures of the introductory stages lose their appeal and a need makes itself felt for more intimate personal contact . " 33 A busy study schedule and a lack of a homey , relaxed environment can lead students to seek solace in their own company . For those who can not overcome the loneliness , if they do not achieve involvement in a friendship group , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disillusion . In a 1980 study of Brazilian students in Florida , Sa found that the small communities that the students formed resembled the home communitas , and that these served to ease the stress in cross-cultural liminality . Co-national group association is generally perceived as disadvantageous to a student 's progress in language skills ; however , there are positive sociological functions played by these groupings , where they exist , in the academic environment. 34 <p> The pre-departure phase of students returning home often finds the students apprehensive about having to leave the new community. 35 For those who have managed to come to terms with the environment and gain satisfaction from their social experiences abroad , adjustment to life in the new community often peaks at this stage equal to that of the initial phase of enthusiasm . This may be exaggerated by what K.T. Trinh sees as the " disagreeableness of thoughts " of return to a lower living standard , often with family responsibilities , less freedom and the need to conform to community standards and parental authority. 36 Beals and Humphrey , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his return is a different person from ... when he left and ordinarily will occupy a new position within ... society . His pattern of personal relationships has been altered and his life chances are different . In a sense he is apt to be estranged from Mexican culture ; at the very least he is now more conscious of it and sees it from a different perspective . Usually , and perhaps always , he will pass through a period of readjustment to the home culture , not unlike that which he experienced when he arrived in the United States . " 37 <p> C.-K . Bae found that among a sample of Korean students , traditionalism , held to be a crucial barrier to satisfactory adjustment of Koreans to American society , followed a U-curve , so that the students returned home as traditional as when they left , having passed through a phase of amenability to American social values. 38 Sa found that a student 's liminal experience in the U.S. enhanced his or her sensitivity to ethnocentric values concerning the cultures of the host and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforce traditional , elitist values . J.S.J. Barry found that , among a sample of approximately 970 Thai students , religious beliefs and values were least subject to change , but their attitudes in education changed over the period of residence in the U.S. toward more open-mindedness. 39 Coelho ( 1972 ) found that among a sample of fifty-six Indian students , constancy of religious observance decreased with the length of time spent in the U.S. 40 Bochner notes , however , " Many students , of course , do not experience cultural conflict , but are enriched by their overseas experience , and able to integrate the two sets of values in a constructive way . Others . . . become marginal to both cultures , and vacillate between traditional and imposed value systems . " 41 <p> Sewell and Davidsen described patterns of adjustment to which students from overseas generally conformed : " detached observers , " students abroad for a short , fixed time , who suffer few , if any , adjustment problems either abroad or at home , and who tend , for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-nationals or within their ethnic groups ; " promoters , " students who take an active part in the life of the host community as " reluctant participants , " experiencing a desire to " sell " their home countries , and who suffer adjustment problems because of conflicts of identity and loyalty ; " enthusiastic participants , " students who are able to detach themselves emotionally , at least temporarily , from their home countries , who give an outward appearance of assimilation and extensive interaction in the life of the host country , and who are most likely to take back their newly acquired habits and customs , possibly experiencing difficulties of reorientation to the home culture ; and " settlers , " students who , for various reasons , contemplate not returning home. 42 Bennett et al . suggested in 1958 that the students who seem to adjust best to the foreign environment may be those who do not adjust satisfactorily to their home environments. 43 One may further note G.C. Chu 's finding that expatriation ( defined as rejection of one 's own cultural membership in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social support received from each group . Support from the home culture is more important than that from the host culture ; if a student is faced with a choice between the two , he or she will first seek support within the home culture , and if that fails , he or she will turn to host culture values. 44 <p> In a study of 126 foreign students who responded to a questionnaire based on the Michigan International Student Problem Inventory , Mahdavi-Harsini found that foreign students ' greatest adjustment problems lay in the " socio-personal " and " English language " categories ? Their preferred sources of help were , in order of preference , friends , the academic adviser ; and the international student office-a finding which echoes Shepard's. 46 In separate studies , R.W. Benn and J.F. Williams described " peer assistance " programs to help students adapt to campus life. 47 It was postulated that foreign students ' patterns of coping with their problems were distinct from those of American students . Cormack and Spaulding et al . have suggested , however , that the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , " and that the foreign student is actually more ' student ' than ' foreign ' in his or her modes of adjustment . " 48 <p> Gullahorn and Gullahorn suggested an extension of the U-curve hypothesis , proposing a W-curve to take into account the readjustment process and reorientation to the home environment following the period of study overseas-a " double uprooting process . " They write in their study of Americans returning home after studying abroad : " some reported that their evaluations of certain situations and practices had changed sufficiently as a result of their participating in alien cultural systems . ... Those who had not previously experienced a major geographic move , or more precisely , a ' psychological relocation , ' seemed particularly likely to feel lost upon their return . ... For these individuals , it was a new experience to discover that in many subtle ways their pattern of expectations and , indeed , some of their values had changed as a result of their exposure and adjustment to a new social system . " 49 After an exciting and successful sojourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own cultural environment . Once the initial elation of being reunited with family and friends has dissipated , the students may have to unlearn certain of the attitudes , norms and social skills acquired abroad . Some returned students , after having achieved a strong identification with the overseas culture , remain ambivalent and may resolve the conflict by rejecting the traditional values of the home society . In a further extension of the U- and W-curve hypotheses , H.A . Selby and C.M. Woods postulated a J-curve , finding a steep decline of morale after the initial phase , followed by a gradual recovery over time , often a period of years. 50 <p> There have been several other suggestions of variations of the U-curve hypothesis , underlying all of which are findings of a typical progression of attitude change connected inter alia , with length of stay in the U.S. , a modification of initial idealistic attitudes towards more realistic ones concerning the U.S. , and , in some cases , the development of antagonistic and negative attitudes towards American political , economic and social models . O. Klineberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U-curve hypothesis : in their international study , the frequency of such key variables as depression , loneliness , and homesickness apparently bore no relationship to the length of the overseas sojourn. 51 Church , in an extensive review of the literature , found that the support for the U-curve hypothesis was weak , inconclusive or overgeneralized . In particular , he noted that even studies supporting the hypothesis differed in their parameters , from nine months ( e.g. , Scott , 1956 ; Sewell and Davidsen , 1961 ; Deutsch and Won , 1963 ) to four or five years ( e.g. , Shepard , 1970 ; Davis , 1971 ) , " making the U-curve description so flexible as to be meaningless . " 52 Church cited work beyond that of the U-curve hypothesis , demonstrating that researchers in the U.S. have sought to construct typologies of characteristics or patterns of adjustment among overseas students , but maintained that their usefulness is limited , stating " Such typologies tend to be largely impressionistic , post hoc rather than predictive , and have not been empirically cross-validated or related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally based on small samples and single national groups making their generalizability questionable . " 53 Nevertheless , with Coelho , I feel that the U-curve can still represent a potentially useful and straightforward , if simplistic , rule-of-thumb model . While one may observe a general tendency towards a U-curve over a period of approximately a year , there may be , within that year , individual peaks and troughs , corresponding to different periods within semesters . The implication is that courses should be planned and paced to take account of the potential for differences of emotional experience , thus offering students either appropriate excitement to exploit their exhilaration , or interest to motivate them out of depression . <p> P. Carey and A. Mariam have offered a socialization model , termed " minoritization , " as a tentative alternative explanatory theory of foreign student adjustment in the U.S. , stating , " the process of socialization involves a complex set of internalization processes through which the foreign-born student must assimilate new and different values , attitudes and roles that are often contradictory . In this regard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through educational institutions is identical to the minoritization process of Afro-Americans and other racial and cultural minority groups . " 54 An important dimension of the minoritization of foreign students is the treatment they receive as a category in general , or as members of a foreign national group , which engenders " marginality and frustration " among the students. 55 Self-esteem is attacked , with a loss of the status enjoyed within the home community ( loss of status is one aspect of culture shock ) , and this trauma will color the student 's attitudes towards the host country . Often considerable time will need to elapse before the student can reconcile the contradictions in his or her life and settle down within the dynamics of life in the host society . Carey and Mariam suggested that " most institutions of higher education have traditionally either ignored the social-emotional dimension of the international student 's needs or provided a set of services independent from the indigenous minority student programs . " 56 <p> While they did not go so far as to suggest that foreign student services should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al . reported in 1980 on a study of 278 students at North Carolina State University , based on a needs analysis approach , which was designed to " compare adjustment levels on the bases of student 's classification and on the area of the world of the student 's home country " in order to improve services to foreign students , and to design " programs differently for different types of international students . " 57 Such an approach represents a considerable advance on the thinking of the previous decades , well-intentioned though the proponents of blanket " foreign student services " were . The results of the study showed that students from the " Orient " and from Southeast Asia reported the greatest difficulty with English , while those from India , Pakistan and Africa reported the lowest difficulty in this area . African students had the greatest overall level of adjustment difficulty , while South and Central American students reported the lowest overall level of difficulty . Based on a survey of 1,900 overseas students in the U.S. , Lee et al . ( 1981 ) claimed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and to be satisfied with his or her academic sojourn was that of a graduate from Latin America or Europe , with a job waiting at home ; residing with an American student ; on an assistantship ; and perceiving him/herself as having a good command of English. 58 According to DuBois , " The degree of command of English which a foreign student brings with him and acquires during his sojourn is ... one of his most significant skills , and at the same time a symptom of his capacity to understand and deal with the American environment , particularly . the high verbalizing environment of ... universities . A low ability ... in English is a serious handicap . . . It may serve to isolate the student from supportive American contacts ... It greatly increases the educational strain , and may reduce the chances of goal achievements that are so necessary to satisfactory adjustment . " 59 <p> Spaulding et al . argued that a review of the literature shows that many university teachers consider dealing with overseas students a chore . Part of this problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a significant element of the teachers ' lack of understanding of the students ' backgrounds and needs , the potential problems and conflicts that these can engender , as well as a general assumption that everyone can cope , given time . Indeed , Spaulding et al . reported findings that American university teachers rarely changed their teaching styles , content or methodology because of the presence of overseas students , even in large numbers . Staff assumed generally that the overseas student was the learner , and made little effort to learn from the experience of the student. 60 <p> Similarly , it was found that large numbers of American students were unaffected by the presence of overseas students on campus , simply because they had had little or no contact with them . Important factors in interaction between American and overseas students are nationality , and facility in English . Opportunities for contact might abound , but are often not exploited . The longer one stays in a country , the more interaction with members of the host community one enjoys ; the greater the social interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become . Sellitz et al . noted , however , that there was no relationship between students ' facility in English and close friendships with Americans. 61 Morris and Davidsen found that students rated by interviewers as having greater facility in English spent a larger proportion of their free time with Americans , had a greater variety of contacts with American people , and were more likely to have at least one close American friend. 62 <p> Spaulding et al . reported further findings that while many American colleges and universities encouraged and developed community programs to involve overseas students in activities beyond the campus , very few such students did , in fact , participate extensively in them . Moreover , the numbers of people involved in such programs from within the community were very small . In general , colleges and universities were organized in a rather traditional academic fashion , with few concessions being made as the structure , number or fields of interest of overseas students changed . Indeed , few institutions had even a clear policy regarding the effective integration of overseas students into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of such students which would serve as a basis for policy decisions in such areas as admissions , curriculum planning or the provision of welfare services . There has been considerable debate in the U.S. over the perceived relevance of many courses to students from overseas , particularly from the Third World. 63 D. Larsdale reported on a survey of 157 overseas engineering students , of whom fifty-four percent said that no professors used materials , assignments or teaching methods relevant to situations in their home countries and twenty-six percent found staff more responsive to American students than to Third World students . The author reports that while some professors may be making an effort to use materials relevant to Third World students ' needs , the prevailing institutional culture precludes fundamental curricular modifications in response to those needs. 64 <p> The past two decades have witnessed a plethora of studies on all aspects of overseas student affairs , from major investigations by international funding agencies to small-scale localized enquiries by students themselves. 66 The National Association for Foreign Student Affairs ( N.A.F.S.A. ) and its affiliates and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus and guidelines for research , as well as representative opinion and informed comment . Very large numbers of students choose to seek some form of education or training in the U.S. each year , and the current trend is for institutions to respond to the demand by searching for a judicious balance between consigning overseas students to campus ghettos by leaving them to their own devices , and an overzealous emphasis on acculturation to the American way of life . Research has suggested that students develop " coping strategies " in the campus environment irrespective of ( or despite ) efforts made to help them. 66 Church concludes that " the majority ( perhaps about 80% ) of the overseas students make reasonable adjustments to their new cultural and institutional demands . " 67 Most universities now provide pre-sessional orientation programs for overseas students , as well as a variety of in-sessional welfare and language services . S.C . Dunnett found that attendance in pre-sessional English language and orientation programs had a significant effect on students ' socialization , but the least effect on emotional adjustment. 68 R.L. Thompson found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " caring " attitude that permeates the whole process . Church noted that the problems reported by overseas students in a variety of host countries had remained essentially the same for the previous thirty years , but that students from different cultures differed in the degree to which they experienced certain problems , stating : " On the basis of consistency of mention and expressed importance in forty-two studies ... the most important problems appear to be language difficulties , financial problems , adjusting to a new educational system , homesickness , adjusting to social customs and norms , and for some students , racial discrimination . " 69 Linguistic Models <p> Institutions of higher education in the U.S. do not have a universal policy on language standards for admissions , and there exist large discrepancies in criteria of English proficiency across the country . Some measure of uniformity has been achieved by the Educational Testing Service 's Test of English as a Foreign Language ( T.O.E.F.L. ) , established in 1966 in response to institutional complaints about the lack of a uniformly recognized test . Prior to 1966 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and varying in methodological approach and in degrees of research base . The role of the English Language Unit ( 1941 ) of the University of Michigan ( originally funded by the Rockefeller Foundation to develop E.F.L. materials for Latin American students ) in the development of a structurally  --  oriented pedagogy in the teaching and testing of E.F.L. is well documented . From that center , language tests such as the Michigan Certificate of Proficiency ( 1953 ) were developed , which for some years were the major tests recognized across the U.S. as offering evidence of a student 's English language proficiency. 70 Now , T.O.E.F.L. is perhaps the best known test of its kind and universally recognized as an acceptable statement of English proficiency by tertiary institutions throughout the U.S. Individual colleges , however , apply differing criteria and levels of requirement for matriculation purposes . A considerable amount of research has been undertaken in recent years with respect to T.O.E.F.L. , not the least significant is a concern with the predictive value of the test , i.e. , how far a T.O.E.F.L. score can act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that English proficiency correlates highly with academic achievement , and J.B. Ayers and R.M. Peters found that while the sub-tests of T.O.E.F.L. were not significantly predictive of academic success , the overall score could be. 71 D. Heil amd L. Aleamoni , in a comprehensive review of the literature , concluded that T.O.E.F.L. appeared no better and no worse as a predictor of academic success among overseas students than regular admission tests used to predict success among native , English-speaking American students.72 <p> Staff and students of linguistics and education , as well as other disciplines , have not been slow to take advantage of the large numbers of non-native speakers of English in their midst for a wide variety of language research projects . The literature reporting such investigations is vast , and quite beyond the scope of this adumbrative survey . While earlier studies claimed that foreign students ' major problems were language related , 73 Beals and Humphrey suggested that " language inadequacy by itself did not prevent satisfactory academic adjustment and achievement . Only when coupled with personal maladjustments , inadequate academic preparation , or lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 74 Further , Sellitz et al. , in two major government-funded studies ( covering 542 foreign students ) of the factors which influence the development of social relations between overseas students and members of the host community , and the effect of these relations on overseas students ' attitudes towards the U.S. , concluded : " those who were competent in their use of the language did not , on the average , report greater interaction with Americans than those who could speak and understand less well ; students who differed in their command of English did not differ , on the average , in the extent of difficulty they reported with academic work . " 75 Despite contradictory earlier findings by DuBois , they reported that their studies provided " only limited support for the assumption that command of English is an important condition for foreign students ' adjustment in the United States . " 76 Such a finding was confirmed by A.R . Ursua in a survey of 201 students , and A.T . Sharon 's survey of 975 foreign students . ' - " Morris and Davidsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who speak and understand English well are likely to have more and closer social relations with Americans than those who have more difficulty with the language , it is by no means dear that good command of English leads to greater association with Americans . The relationship may be in the opposite direction-associating with Americans may help the foreign student to speak English more fluently . Or it may be that some other characteristic , such as self-confidence or national origin , underlies the apparent relation between language skill and the development of social relations . What is most likely ... is that the influences are reciprocal : students with good command of the language may be more self-confident about taking part in activities with Americans ; this greater participation , in turn , may lead to improvement in their command of English . " 78 Be that as it may , half the students surveyed by Seilitz et al . selected " speaking English " as one of a list of " possibly troublesome things " with which they had , in fact , had trouble , and a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started on academic work . For forty-seven percent , spoken English was the major problem ; a student quoted by Sellitz et al . stated , " The most difficult thing-my spoken English is very poor . Sometimes I 'm afraid the professor or assistant can not understand me about my studies and I 'm afraid they suspect my knowledge is also poor . " 79 Hill reported that in his survey of seventy-eight students , academic problems predominated and that these were largely related to a lack of proficiency in English . Shepard , in a survey of 247 foreign students reported that a lack of English proficiency was the greatest problem in acculturation , with students being aware that their weaknesses in language skills were a handicap to successful social relations . <p> The familiar difficulty of students not asking questions was examined by M. Adams in a cross-cultural study in which he focused less on the potential for learning the oral skills necessary to participate in academic contexts but rather on the culture barriers to such participation . Adams writes , " In terms of classroom behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arab , and Oriental " produces students whom we can expect to ask questions or make comments in class . " 80 But J.N. Lacasa and J. Lacasa , in a survey of perceived second-language needs at the University of Iowa , found that students were very aware of the communication skills they needed to develop in the host community , showing " a great deal of unanimity in the priorities of their communication needs in the foreign language . They indicate interest in acquiring tools to meet people , to show pleasure , approval , and their opposites , to express want and appreciation , to suggest , to request , to inquire , to seek and give permission , to express possibility , and to offer to do something . " 81 Where students perceive their difficulties in the area of language proficiency , participation in situations which require a degree of English language proficiency is liable to increase dissonance because in such situations , students become more sensitive to their deficiencies . This increase in self-consciousness may lead to withdrawal from such situations. 82 It is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qua non for academic success , but students ' own perceptions of their inadequacies may override their potential , thus altering it in unpredictable ways . Language difficulties have been claimed , as much as other difficulties such as the anticipation of family problems in the event of academic failure , to be catalysts for excessive anxiety and stress among foreign students. 83 Campus Policy <p> The rapid and exponential growth of overseas student numbers during the 1970s led to unethical and irresponsible behavior on the part of some disreputable institutions. 84 The unfavorable publicity given to questionable recruitment and admission practices led to N.A.F.S.A. launching a self-regulatory institutional code of practice , which many institutions have now endorsed . The increasing political implications of overseas student admissions , and the link with foreign policy considerations ( e.g. , vis-a-vis Iran in 1979 , or Libya in 1986 ) , have led the immigration rules regarding students to become increasingly more complex . Often , the political considerations have overridden pedagogical ones : J. Reichard notes , " A number of developments ... have stimulated more serious examination of foreign student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... were more often related to political and economic considerations than to educational ones , yet they increasingly caught the attention of ... those responsible for institutional policy and signaled to them that a broad spectrum of foreign student exchange activities might well deserve review . " 85 <p> The U.S. authorities are now addressing the potential problems of uncontrolled recruitment and growth of overseas students , although C.D. Goodwin and M. Nacht make it clear that there is no one level of significant governmental decision making as far as higher educational institutions are concerned . They suggest that a federal policy would be hard to find even if " sufficient diligent attention were devoted to a search for it . " 86 Reichard has offered an overview of the ethical , ideological and educational issues currently being considered in the development of international education policy in the U.S. G. Taylor writes , " Questions are being asked about the right mix of students ... their level of English ability , the charges of dependency on foreign labour in the fields of research and teaching assistantship , and the educational implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " 87 <p> The overseas student population in the U.S. is large enough to be visible , and is becoming increasingly audible , and although Congress has become aware of the wide-ranging political implications of a national policy and the necessity for consultation with many sections of the community to achieve this policy , to date the problem has not been grappled with in any really coherent fashion by the national policy makers . <p>
