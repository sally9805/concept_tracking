EVA SCUFFED HER FEET ON THE polished brick of Lincoln Avenue as she crossed the plaza . She walked ungracefully , stumping along her new carving tucked carefully in her arms . She passed the galleries and boutiques without glancing in the windows . Their contents  --  designer fashions , bizarre " art , " and the inescapable coyotes ; bandana-adorned caricatures in pastel blues , pinks , and greens  --  were no part of her Santa Fe . <p> She paused to watch the workers setting up a bandstand for tomorrow night . It sent her back to Fiestas years ago ; driving out from the pueblo to picnic on the hood of the pickup in Fort Marcy Park , with mariachis playing and kids and dogs rolling in the dirt . She remembered playing with the wind when her mother was n't looking weaving twists of air into dust devils - miniature cyclones of stinging sand . Sometimes , when her older brother Joe had been pushing her , she would send a dust devil to plague him . She would laugh while he spat dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grandfather was the only one who did n't scold her for her wind tricks . Mother , if she noticed , would silence them both with a fierce glare . But on that one night of the year , even Mother could not frighten Eva . <p> Fiesta marked the end of summer and always began with the burning of Zozobra  --  Old Man Gloom  --  a puppet effigy , everyone 's symbol for their worst troubles . When the flames rose around his giant paper head and his eyes began to glow with green fire , everyone felt the magic of that purge . Eva remembered softly chanting , " No more trouble , no more fear , no more for another year , " while Grandfather 's warm arms and an old wool blanket kept out the sharp wind . She would n't dream of imagining her mother as Zozobra , but she let the hurt of being scolded burn away in the fireworks . <p> That was a long time ago . Fiesta was different now ; everything was different . <p> Eva walked slowly past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portico helping Grandfather sell his carvings on many a lazy , dusty afternoon . Kachinas , carved the old Hopi way ( the Hopi were Grandfather 's people ) from a single cottonwood root , and painted in the summer colors or the winter colors by Grandfather with Eva helping . Now the kachinas were intricate meaningless sculptures that sold for thousands of dollars in hushed carpeted galleries . <p> Eva stopped at the corner where Grandfather had liked to sit , back in the shade behind the half-wall at the eastern end of the portico . Back then the plaza smelled of sunshine on dry dirt , cottonwood breezes , and the warm leather whiff of La Fonda on the comer , where Eva would run to fetch a lemonade with the shiny nickel Grandfather gave her . Now it was all French restaurants and the fancy perfumes of rich patrons and sightseers . You even had to have a permit , certifying you were a " Native American , " to sell under the portico . <p> She turned her eyes away from the silent hawk-faces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking head down , away from the plaza . The turistas in their bright holiday clothes gave her a wide berth . Indians were for staring at , not for talking to . No one wanted to say hello to an ugly Tewa girl walking down Palace Avenue . <p> She wound her way through the streets to an old adobe house , trim newly painted bright turquoise , that bore a copper plaque inscribed " Alamosa Gallery . " Eva stepped inside and stood blinking after the bright sunlight . <p> A young woman looked up from the antique desk . Pretty , blonde , slim . She could be a model . She could be on TV . Eva clutched her package tighter . Inside it was the only beauty she had . <p> One bag ugly  --  you go to bed , you put a bag over her head . <p> " Can I help you ? " <p> Eva stepped forward . " I 'm here to see Mrs. Rougier . " Her tongue stumbled over the foreign word . <p> " Do you have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Eva , fighting the cringe inside her . " I said I would come today . " <p> " I see . Well , let me tell her you 're here . What 's your name ? " <p> " Eva Trujillo , " said Eva , struggling to keep her voice above a whisper . <p> The pretty girl 's heels rapped hollowly on the wooden floor as she left the room . Eva was alone again , staring at sculpture and paintings illuminated by track lighting hung from the ceiling 's ancient vigas . She wandered down the room , gazing briefly at pieces that stirred nothing in her . Cowboy bronzes , static pot-and-squash still-lifes , views of Chimayo in every kind of weather . Time-worn images that were sure to please the tourists , interspersed with cactus collages in neon hues and other new " Southwestern " art . Even the Gorman , occupying a place of honor above the mantel , held little meaning for her . The shapeless woman , huddled in her blanket , only reminded Eva of how the world saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put a bag over her head and one over yours in case hers slips . <p> " Here she is ! " <p> Eva turned as she heard the footsteps coming down the hall . Mrs. Rougier and another woman had followed the pretty gift back . " Hello , Eva , " said Mrs. Rougier , holding out a perfectly manicured hand . " I 'm so glad you came in today ! This is Ms. Messersmith , one of our best customers . " <p> " Hello , " said Eva , shaking Ms. Messersmith 's hand in her own cold one . The woman wore a heavy squash-blossom necklace over her black silk blouse . Her face was sharp and she did n't smile . She avoided looking at Eva after the first glance , turning back to Mrs. Rougier . <p> " Eva is a very promising new artist , " smiled Mrs. Rougier . Large silver earrings flashed out through her auburn hair . " Let 's see what you 've brought , shall we ? " She led them over to the desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fawn . A beautiful baby , lifting innocent eyes to a new world . Eva had let the wood 's own dappling form its markings , brought the whorls to life in shaping muscle . She smiled softly at it , looking up from its nest of paper . <p> " Very pretty . " Ms. Messersmith sounded bored . <p> " Why , yes , Eva , it 's lovely , " said Mrs. Rougier . <p> Eva looked from one woman to the other , her heart sinking . " You do n't like it . " <p> " No , it 's very good , " said Mrs. Rougier , with a glance at her client . " It 's just not the style Ms. Messersmith is looking for . We 'll show it , of course . Heather , make out a consignment slip for it . " <p> The pretty girl nodded and placed a form in her typewriter . Eva resisted the impulse to snatch up the carving again . <p> " Ms. Messersmith is looking for a piece for her foyer  --  " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My home is designed to capture that feeling . " <p> Eva nodded . She could imagine Ms. Messersmith 's home ; had seen pictures of such homes in magazines . All angles and skylights , with freestanding adobe walls inside , built only to display expensive interpretations of the desert 's starkness . <p> " Perhaps you 're working on something along that line ? We could stop by your studio and see . " said Mrs. Rougier . <p> A glimmer of interest appeared in Ms. Messersmith 's eyes . Eva opened her mouth to refuse , but Mrs. Rougier interrupted . <p> " Yes , why do n't we , it would be lovely ! Eva has a delightful little studio  --  in the older part of town . " <p> In the poorer part of town , thought Eva , why do n't you just say it . Aloud , she said , " I do n't have guests come there . I can bring a new carving here . " <p> " Oh , no , I would n't dream of troubling you to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tomorrow , say fourish ? We wo n't be in your way , I promise . Do n't you think , Frances ? " <p> Ms. Messersmith nodded . " Charming . " <p> " Thank you so much , Eva . We 'll see you tomorrow . " <p> Dismissed , Eva had nothing to do but trudge slowly home . <p> Joe was there . She could tell by the smell of the room  --  a hint of tobacco and beer . She glanced at the stove and saw he 'd been into the stew she 'd left simmering . She put the receipt for her carving on the work table and walked over to the kitchenette , began to clean up the mess he 'd left , wondering why she put up with it . To get away from her family 's demands and criticisms , was n't that why she 'd left the pueblo ? If she were a white woman , she could have just thrown her brother out . <p> " Hey , Eva . " Slam of the bathroom door . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foamed over her hands . <p> " You sell ? " <p> Eva shook her head . <p> " Shit . Give me twenty , then . " <p> She fought the rising fear and anger . " I do n't have it . " <p> " Well , you better get it . " <p> " Go away , Joe . " <p> He muscled up beside her as he 'd done when they were kids , thrusting his barrel chest forward from skinny hips . Eva turned her head and stared hard into his eyes , the way she 'd defended herself all the years . Her look said , do n't push me , or I 'll set the wind on you . She held it , praying he would n't hear her heart pounding . <p> He backed down , eyes growing shifty and nervous ; he shuffled away . Eva breathed again , rinsed a dish and set it in the rack . <p> " I got ta pay somebody , " Joe said , whiny now . <p> " I ca n't help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer out of the refrigerator and popped it open . Eva dried her hands and went to her work table , taking out a new piece of cottonwood . It was silky smooth under the bark , soft and pale . Two little knots right together reminded her of eyes  --  an owl ? <p> She stroked it , and sighed . An owl was not Southwestern enough . People carved owls back east . She set the wood back on the shelf and took up another piece . This one was twisted , deformed . Like Santa Fe . <p> Joe belched . <p> " Go away , Joe . I ca n't concentrate . " <p> " Listen to the big artist . " <p> Eyes flared . " Shut up ! " <p> " You have n't sold nothing since the Market . " <p> " That 's more than you 've done . If you want any money you 'd better leave me alone to do my work . " <p> " You should go back to the pueblo and get married . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 'd take you . You coyote ugly . " <p> " Get out ! " <p> The shifty look came back , and his eyes slid away from hers . He got up and pitched his empty in the sink . Grabbed his denim jacket from a chair back , and headed for the door with a parting shot . <p> " Women are n't supposed to work wood . Grandfather was crazy to teach you . A woman should get married , have kids . That 's what you 're good for . " <p> He dodged out as a whirlwind of pencils , dust , and small objects blasted across the room and into the door behind him . Eva 's anger drained and she blinked stupidly at the mess . Then she got up to fetch the broom . <p> Coyote ugly  --  you chew your arm off to get away the next morning rather than wake her up . <p> Eva robbed her temples , then her eyes . The tiny light on her work table cast a golden pool of brightness in the dim room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to coax into life . It had a rattlesnake 's head  --  sharp fang danger  --  and the beginnings of rattles , but in between it was just a stick , stripped of bark and with a few scales carved in . <p> Sighing Eva got up and went to the kitchenette , lit the stove and put the kettle on . Then she walked over to the metal shelves where she kept her tools and her few books . On the top shelf lived Coyote , little eyes shining black up by the cracked plaster ceiling . Gently Eva lifted him down . <p> Grandfather had carved him while Eva watched , and given him to her before he died . She remembered receiving Coyote from trembling , blotched hands . Now she set him in the pool of light on her table . He stood half crouched , gazing intently , poised to fight or to flee . Warm memories washed over Eva as she looked at him . <p> Every curve , every line , every hair lovingly carved was a lesson . Grandfather had talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Coyote had tricked , stolen , cheated , and been tricked and cheated in return . Yet there was always another layer of meaning , peeled back like bark from satiny wood . Coyote never lost his innocent wonder at life . Coyote learned his lessons the hard way and in this he was a teacher . He did what he had to ; he survived , on his own . <p> " Coyote is like you , Eva , " Grandfather had said . " He frightens silly humans with his mischief . " And Eva had shrank against the tree-roots . <p> " Coyote is like me , too , " said Grandfather , as little curls of wood fluttered off his fingers onto his faded dungarees . " He has no friend but himself . He licks when he can lick , he bites when he must bite . He 's free . " <p> " But you have me , Grandfather . I 'm your friend . " <p> " You are ? Are you sure I wo n't . . . bite you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieks filled the summer sky . <p> The kettle screamed ; Eva hurried to turn it off . She made coffee and carried her cup back to the table . Set Coyote back from the light , where he watched while she picked up the snake-stick . <p> Tiny flakes of wood fell from her hands to the table . Every couple of minutes Eva sent a twist of air across to carry the debris into the wastebasket at one side . Each puff of air was an act of defiance . At home , her mother would have punished her for it . " You want people to think you 're a witch ? " <p> Eva remembered the beating she 'd received one winter during the Turtle dance , the year her mother had caught her using wind to sweep the house instead of a broom . She 'd been terrified just at the sight of the Tsave Yoh , with their masks and their Spanish whips , and after they beat her they told her mother to tap on the chimney if Eva was bad again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the hills . <p> " And if we find you are a witch , we will eat you , " they 'd told her . That night , as she lay shivering in her bed , trying to weep as quietly as she could , Grandfather had laid a hand over her mouth , and silently placed Coyote under her arm . She had never slept so well . <p> Eva looked up from the stick in her hands to Coyote watching warily from the shadows . Smiling , she reached out to stroke his back . <p> " You are my only friend , " she whispered . Coyote just kept watching . <p> AT FOUR THE next day Eva sat at her table , nervously listening as she whittled her stick . It still was n't a snake . Maybe it would never be one . She held it at arm 's length . It looked like a stick . She put it down and pushed away from the table . <p> Eva went to the stove and put on the kettle . It was still hot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on anyway . She wiped the spotless counter and looked around the room . It was tidy and comfortless . It needed painting . Eva sighed and sat down again , picking up her carving . <p> The long , straight section was the least snake-like . Maybe a slight twist would bring it to life . She picked up her knife and gently scraped at the carved scales , finding smoothness beneath , her mind already picturing the arc of scales up the side of the wood . Yes , much better . She glanced up at Coyote , still watching from the back of the table . He seemed to approve . <p> A sharp knock at the door made her start . Eva rose and smoothed her skirt as she went forward . The door creaked as she pulled it open . <p> " Hello , Eva , " said Mrs. Rougier , stepping inside . " Did n't you hear the bell ? " <p> " It does n't work , " said Eva , closing the door behind Ms. Messersmith . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot . " She was wearing a skirt painted with Hopi designs in pink and purple , a pink woolen shawl , pink suede boots . She unwrapped the shawl from her shoulders and dropped it on Eva 's chair . Ms. Messersmith wore black , and a sour look . She stood just inside the door , gazing around the room . <p> " Would you like some coffee ? " <p> " That would be lovely , thank you , Eva . Oh , is this your latest piece ? " <p> Eva glanced to where Mrs. Rougier stood by the work table , nodded . She put a filter and coffee in the top of her old battered pot , poured hot water over . It spattered in the bottom half , and a warm smell arose . <p> " You see , Frances ? A snake ! Is n't it lovely ? " <p> Eva carried cups of hot coffee to the ladies . Mrs. Rougier had the carving in her hands , turning it around . <p> " See how she 's done the tail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the rattles ? " <p> " They grow a new one every year . " " So this snake would be one , two  --  " " What 's that , some kind of fox ? " <p> Eva looked up , saw Ms. Messersmith pointing at Coyote . Mrs. Rougier stopped counting . Eva stepped around the table and picked him up . <p> " No , " she said . " He 's a coyote . " <p> " Oh , let me see , " cried Mrs. Rougier , taking Coyote from Eva 's hands . " Oh , how beautiful it is ! Frances , look ! " <p> " I never saw a coyote that was n't howling at the moon , " said Ms. Messersmith . <p> " That 's wolves , " said Eva , fighting anger . " Wolves howl at the moon . Coyotes sing to each other . " <p> " Oh , it 's lovely , Eva ! Why have n't you brought it to the gallery ? " <p> " I did n't carve him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her client . <p> " Look at his eyes , they almost look alive ! Did you paint them , Eva ? " <p> " They 're beads . " <p> " Very good , " nodded Ms. Messersmith , running her hand along Coyote 's back . Eva clenched her fists at her sides . <p> " How much ? " asked Ms. Messersmith . <p> " He 's not for sale . " <p> " Oh , Eva , you must sell it ! Such a beautiful piece ! It should be on display where it can be admired . " <p> Eva could hear the front door opening . She felt panic rising stepped forward and took Coyote back . " My grandfather made him . He 's not for sale . " She hurried to the shelves against the back wall . <p> " I want him , " said Ms. Messersmith . " Just name your price . " <p> Eva stretched to place Coyote back up in his comer . " Not for sale , " she repeated . She turned back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind them Joe stood in the doorway . With a tiny jerk of her head she told him to leave . She was not sure whether to be glad when he obediently closed the door . <p> Ms. Messersmith 's coffee cup clacked hard on the work table . " I 've seen enough . " <p> " Oh , Eva , I hope you 'll reconsider . It does n't matter if you did n't carve the piece . . . . " Mrs. Rougier faltered under Eva 's silent gaze . " Or maybe you could carve another one ? Yes , your own work ! That would be lovely , do n't you think , Frances ? " <p> " Mm , " grunted Ms. Messersmith . <p> Mrs. Rougier 's smile fluttered hesitantly around her face . " Well , I think we should go now . We do n't want to keep Eva from her work . " She retrieved her shawl and hurried to the door where Ms. Messersmith waited . " Thank you so much , Eva . Be sure to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched from the door as they went down the uneven stone steps to where a silver Mercedes was parked . Hurrying away from her because she was n't what they wanted her to be . It made her angry . She had tried  --  she 'd spent hours on the snake . Instead they wanted Coyote , whom they could never , never understand . <p> The air was sharply cool already , hinting of fall . Eva shivered and closed the door . <p> She sat down at her work table , but did not pick up her knife . Instead she stared up at Coyote , crouching in his corner . <p> The door creaked open ; Joe . <p> " Who were they ? " <p> Eva 's gaze dropped to her hands clasped in her lap . " Mrs. Rougier owns the gallery . She brought a customer over . " <p> " They buy ? " <p> " Maybe a commission . " <p> Joe grunted and headed for the fridge . Eva watched him fix a sandwich . He took the sandwich and a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . She frowned , wishing he would go away . It was hard to concentrate when he was around . Sighing she got up and poured herself a cup of coffee , brought it back and sat down to work . The TV blared . <p> Slowly , patiently , she began to coax the snake out of its stick . The twist she 'd added lent just the right movement to the form . Eva sighed , anger fading , and bent closer , beginning to enjoy this new carving . She deepened the scale cuts , added more detail to the rattles , feeling the snake 's emotion begin to emerge . Forgetting the TV , forgetting demands from Mrs. Rougier and Joe , she lost herself in the work and felt free ; only her hands and the knife , and the beauty she was creating , existed . <p> After a while she stretched and looked around , noticing the room beyond her work light was dim . The Sangre de Cristos glowed pink outside her window ; sunset . She flipped on the light switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands , she looked up at herself in the mirror and smiled . Set in her flat face her eyes glowed with warm excitement ; triumph of creation . Times like this were good , she thought , drying her hands . <p> The front door creaked , then shut . <p> " Joe ? " <p> No answer , TV still blaring . She went over and turned it off , picked up Joe 's dirty plate and beer can , put them on the counter and returned to her table . As she sat she glanced up with a smile at Coyote . <p> He was gone . <p> With an anguished cry she jumped up , knocking over her chair as she ran for the door . Yanking it open , she saw Joe halfway up the street , Coyote tucked under his arm . He turned , saw her , ran . <p> " Joe ! " she screamed . For a moment she stared in disbelief , then she snatched her keys from the nail behind the door and slammed it behind her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rounding the comer , heading for Agua Fria Street . Eva tore after him as fast as she could . She reached the comer just in time to see him turning east . The chill evening air burned her lungs as she gasped it in . She followed . <p> As she started across the street a turning car shrieked its brakes at her . Eva screamed back at it , then kept running , the driver 's curses fading behind her and her heart pounding . <p> Joe was leading her toward the plaza . The closer she got , the more people and the fewer cars she met . Fiesta was beginning , and soon the plaza would be swarming with pedestrians . The streets were already blockaded . Eva dreaded the crowd where she might easily lose Joe . One dark head in a denim jacket looked much like another . <p> She reached the southwest comer of the plaza and stood gasping , eyes searching the crowd . At the far comer she spotted Joe , and forced her aching legs to run again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he was heading for the gallery , and would reach it before her . <p> Then joy burst into her mind . The gallery was closed ; Mrs. Rongier was treating her best customers to a gourmet picnic in Fort Marcy Park , to watch Zozobra . Eva would catch up with Joe at the gallery , and take Coyote back . <p> Brushing past tourists in festive colors and locals in their own fashion statements , she hurried uphill . The light was fading fast and Eva could hear the dull roar of many voices and a distant throb of mariachi music . She slipped onto the twisted street that led to Alamosa Gallery and the crowd thinned suddenly . Eva ran on . <p> Slowing to a walk as the gallery came into view , Eva saw Joe staring at its locked door . She closed her parched mouth and breathed the crisp air through flaring nostrils . Joe turned and saw her . <p> " They 're gone , " she called , and in the same moment Joe sprang from the porch and dashed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery door just long enough to recognize Mrs. Rougier 's handwriting on the note taped to it . Joe turned north again between two buildings , making for Fort Marcy . <p> Breathing hurt now and Eva focused on continuing to move . She crossed streets choked with people and got soft dirt in her shoes in rough alleyways . Occasionally she remembered to look for Joe . She spotted him twice ; they were moving across the tide of people heading for the park 's gates . Across the arroyo , uphill skirting a gently eroding bank , and suddenly Eva was above the park and Zozobra loomed before her , the huge white-robed figure with its black bow tie and buttons , dwarfing the nearby buildings , standing still in the darkness like an actor waiting for his cue while tiny mariachis warbled at his feet . Beneath him the park teemed with people  --  no lazy rooftop picnics now . People crammed through the gates , shouldering each other for a view . <p> Eva stopped , panting . Her head throbbed and her legs were shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end and the sea of people below her applauded , yelling and whistling over the unintelligible announcer 's voice that boomed through speakers and echoed off the hillside . <p> From her vantage point Eva could see tiny figures moving forward to positions behind Zozobra , ready to work the cables that moved his arms and head . She searched for her brother among them . Then she spotted a pale gleam against denim ; Coyote 's head peeking from beneath Joe 's arm . Joe was scanning the crowd below , searching the picnic cloths which were the only spaces not totally covered with bodies . Eva began to work her way toward him . <p> Small white-sheeted torch bearers filed across the platform and down the steps , performing their traditional opening dance . A part of Eva responded , remembered excitement and anticipation awakened as the drums began their slow heavy pounding and Zozobra uttered his first low moan . She dragged her mind back to her brother and hurried forward . Joe had climbed down the hillside heading for the park . Eva scrambled after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She kept his bobbing head in sight ; the only face not turned toward Zozobra . He had reached the fence and was starting to climb it . Eva began to run , but stopped as a policeman accosted Joe from the other side of the fence . Joe dropped to the ground , started back up the hill at an angle . Eva scrambled after . <p> A flash of light and a roaring cheer announced the entrance of the Fire Dancer . From the corner of her eye Eva glimpsed silver and red flying ribbons , but she kept her attention on Joe and caught up with him halfway up the hill . She grabbed his arm . <p> " Get off ! " he yelled , still climbing up the hill , dragging her with him . <p> " Coyote 's mine , Joe ! Give him back ! " <p> " You can carve another , big shot artist . " He tried to wrench his arm away . " Let go , bruja ! " <p> " Give him back ! She wo n't buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You watch . " <p> " No ! " Eva grabbed for Coyote . The back of Joe 's hand slammed into her face and she fell , white lights flashing in her head . Zozobra 's outraged howl penetrated the ringing in her ear , and softer voices nearer asking , " You all right ? " <p> Eva struggled to her feet , brushing off dust and helping hands , and ploughed her way back up the embankment . Joe was running north ; he would skirt behind Zozobra 's puppeteers to the west , to sneak through the clubhouse and into the park . Eva tried to run but every step brought pain ; she stood with tears streaming down her face , watching the dark form slide through shadows along the back of the hill , while Zozobra flailed his giant arms at the fire dancer 's threat and the crowd chanted , " Burn him , burn him ! " <p> Twin waterfalls of fireworks flared to life on either side of Zozobra , illuminating Joe 's denim back , and a sudden breeze lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fed it , pouring anger into it and wrenching it into a screw . The crowd gasped as the vortex caught dust and sparks and swelled suddenly . Eva 's scream of anger joined Zozobra 's roar and the dust devil leapt taller than the puppet , sucking the fireworks into itself and spitting sparks in all directions . She pushed it toward Joe . <p> He was still running but the devil caught him and he stood struggling for balance , buffeted , dust and sparks flying about his head . Zozobra was burning a few yards away , fire glowing inside his howling mouth ; Eva caught a strand of flame and wove it into her whirlwind . The fire was hers now , and into it she put not only Joe but Mrs. Rougier , Ms. Messersmith , her mother . All the people who pushed her ; she gave them all to the flames , the purging fire of Zozobra , flames and the white heat of her rage blotting out everything else . <p> Vaguely she heard screaming ; the crowd was frightened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good . Let it burn away your troubles . The flaming whirlwind stood like a torch against the night , dwarfing Zozobra , Someone near her cried , " It 's beautiful ! " and Eva smiled . <p> Joe 's jacket was on fire . He flung his arms up over his head and fell to his knees , flames dancing over his back . Coyote dropped to the ground . <p> Shrieks filled the air ; the crowd 's hysteria obliterated the drums and Zozobra 's amplified howls . Dark shapes were swarming up the hillside like cockroaches . Joe disappeared behind the tide but the whipping flames kept the rescuers at bay . The wind had quickened the fire and Zozobra ceased to thrash , abandoned by his manipulators , his eyes glowing green in his burning head and bits of flame already falling to the ground from limp skeletal arms . The recorded drums continued but Zozobra was silent . Shocked chatter ran through the crowd ; someone nearby whimpered . <p> Enough . Eva sighed and let go of the flames . The dust devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Pandemonium erupted in the park . Eva ignored the frightened , excited voices ; she slowly climbed the steep embankment and drank in the deep , cool night . <p> A mass of firemen and policemen were swarming like ants around where Joe had fallen . An ambulance that had been standing by drove up , and she glimpsed Joe standing , arguing , then being strapped onto a stretcher . A pang of sadness was gone in an instant ; Joe had earned his punishment . All their lives he had pushed her , now Eva had finally pushed back . She knew he would n't bother her again . <p> Looking at Zozobra , now engulfed in flame but forgotten by his audience , she thought of the old tradition ; burn your troubles for a year . Eva smiled . She was free . <p> And she was beautiful . You did n't have to have a pretty face to be beautiful , you did n't have to be what other people wanted . You just had to make your work  --  carving or fire  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She looked up at the stars , hundreds of them piercing the black night . Grandfather 's voice echoed in her mind , telling of Coyote , who set out to help place the stars in patterns but then scattered them over the sky because it was too much work . It made the others angry , but Coyote said , " It 's better that way , " and he was right . <p> Something soft and warm touched her leg . Eva looked down into Coyote 's glowing eyes . Beautiful Coyote . Yes , she was like him . She did n't need anyone else to say so . No one else could ever understand her own particular beauty . She picked Coyote up , cradling him to her , and padded through the back streets toward home , attended by summer 's last sweet breeze . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " I 'm terribly sorry , but next week is the blessing of the animals .
