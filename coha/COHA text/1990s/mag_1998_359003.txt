Jesus is running late . The State Department seemed hesitant to let him into the country  --  his visa application was approved and then unapproved . A few days later , without explanation , it was approved again . So now Jesus is in  --  but he 's running late . At 11 p.m. the man checking names at the door of the Village Vanguard , the New York City jazz club where Miles played , where Monk played , says Jesus has n't arrived but his plane " is touching down even as we speak . " As a result , Jesus ' set has been pushed back from 11:30 to ' round midnight . The club is half empty . Only the true believers , only the people whose jazz souls need saving , are going to stick it out that late on a weeknight . <P> Past midnight now , and Jesus arrives . Jesus ( " Chucho " ) Valdes is the greatest jazz pianist in Cuba , perhaps one of the greatest pianists in the world . He 's a tall man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is casually dressed tonight , clad in an untucked purple shirt , jeans and Fila sneakers . He has played in the U.S. before , but this month he is embarking on his first sizable Stateside tour , one of the most extensive by any Cuban performer since the embargo began in 1962 . Valdes has a new solo CD to promote , Bele Bele en la Habana ( Blue Note ) , an album of virtuosity and intellect and sorcery that could just turn out to be the attention-grabbing Kind of Blue of Cuban jazz . <P> He sits at the piano . He is a faucet , a river , a flood of music . His left hand pounds out sharp , staccato chords , and his right hand flies , hummingbird fast , up and down the keyboard . There is history here : the imaginative , intricate runs of Art Tatum , the restless romanticism of Bill Evans , and of course , the hot , insistent rhythms of Cuba . Valdes ' set is frustratingly brief  --  he is exhausted from his travels  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the name of his first number . He smiles and says , " Improvisacion ! " <P> Cuba is an island no more , musically speaking . Its music was once a force in this country , but in the ' 60s , the embargo hit , and Cuban musicians were barred , for the most part , from playing in the U.S. The music , in America , slipped from a place of prominence . But in 1988 Congress passed an amendment to the embargo that allowed Cuban musicians to perform Stateside if they came as part of a cultural exchange , a requirement typically fulfilled by the artist 's giving an educational workshop in addition to his or her regular gig . <P> Cuban artists are taking advantage of the crack in the embargo door . Over the next few weeks , Valdes plans stops in Philadelphia , Washington , Los Angeles and St. Paul , Minn . Earlier this year , La Charanga Habanera , a hard salsa act that is considered one of Havana 's hottest bands , played its first-ever show in the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist Ruben Gonzales , 79 , considered himself retired and did n't even own a piano . This summer he has a solo album out ( the smoothly accomplished Introducing ... Ruben Gonzales on Nonesuch ) , and in October and November he will be touring the States . Other Cuban acts , including the dance band Los Van Van and the bright-voiced a cappella act Vocal Sampling , are also on the road in the U.S.
