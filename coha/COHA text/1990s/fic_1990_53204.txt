ContentsMachiko-San Black School # As an Asian <p> In 1965 , when I was nine , my father moved us from Japan to Baton Rouge , Louisiana . He had been an exchange student at Louisiana State University years ago , and now LSU had invited him to be a visiting professor in the agriculture department . <p> We rented an apartment near campus , across the street from a grove of wild berries . Long ago someone had tried to plant a garden of crepe myrtles there , but the garden had been overwhelmed by the berries , thousands of dense , entangled runners . Every weekday morning , I would crawl through a narrow tunnel in the grove  --  a shortcut to the other side  --  looking at the stitch pattern of shadows . I would emerge in the backyard of the Protestant church and wait for the school bus with the other children . <p> I attended Louisiana State University Terrace Elementary School , which had some rather strict rules of behavior . On the school bus , boys were to sit on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious school grounds was segregated as well , with the basketball court as the demarcation area . Once , I got into trouble because I had inadvertently wandered into forbidden territory , and my father was summoned by the principal . <p> " Doctor , " the lady principal said , " I 'm certainly not discouraging him from being friends with the other children , all of them . Just the opposite . But in order for him to do that , he must adhere to the rules , and , of course , he really must learn the language . Do n't you think he should learn the language ? I imagine it must be so inconvenient for him , not knowing the language . " <p> My father promised her he would see to it that I learned the language . He had his own opinions about the rules of behavior , the unique and strict morality of the people , in Baton Rouge . " Americans call it the Bible Belt , " he tried to explain . One time my mother had helped his colleague 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're from Michigan , " he said . " Had she been born and raised by a good family in Louisiana , she would n't let even a woman touch her body . " <p> My homeroom teacher gave me an American name , Harry , and told me not to use my real name from that point on because it was a Japanese word . My first lesson in English was to memorize the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag . Every morning , all the students had to stand up and make an oath to the Star-Spangled Banner , which hung at the upper left side of the chalkboard . " I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America , and to the Republic for which it stands , one nation under God , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . " It seemed like an extremely odd ritual . When I told my parents about it , my mother laughed and said that she had had to do the same sort of thing for the Japanese flag when she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Terrace Elementary School , supposedly a more liberal institution because it was part of the university , was nearly all white for my first two years there . Twenty-some students were in my class , and of those , only two were black . In the entire school , from the first to ninth grades , there were a total of only five or six black children . <p> One of the black students in my class was the son of a minister , and the other one 's father managed a used car dealership . Both boys wore stiffly starched white shirts , ties , and well-polished leather shoes to school every day . They looked wonderful , better than any of the white kids , when they arrived at school in the morning , but they looked pretty miserable when they left in the afternoon , dirty and disheveled from having to wear the clothes while playing basketball in gym class or softball during lunch break . <p> Theodore Henderson , the car dealer 's son , told us once that some men from the Chamber of Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the company so I ca n't come to school anymore . ' Mr. Martel , we 're not doing anything wrong , ' my dad says , and they go , ' Look , slave , do n't you dare even think about wanting an ordinary life . ' You believe it ? They called him slave ! " <p> Ted was a cocky kid , maybe given to a bit of exaggeration . He knew how we 'd react to the story , and he was enjoying the attention , smirking a little . <p> I believed him , though . " What are you going to do ? " I asked , horrified . <p> One of the girls nudged me . She told me to drop the subject , not to get involved . As a Southern Protestant , she felt she had an obligation to tutor me on the correct standards of Louisiana life . <p> The teachers  --  especially the white female ones  --  were extremely tough on Ted and the other boy . The women were older and quite experienced as educators , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-rights movement . Whenever one of the boys could n't answer a question or made a minor error , the . teachers would chastise him harshly . They called the boys lazy , said they lacked concentration . They often told them they were a negative influence on the other students . <p> I did n't feel particularly self-conscious about being an Asian until a young Army officer came to visit our school one day . It was in the middle of the Vietnam War ; it must have been about a year after we had moved to Baton Rouge , since by then I had learned the language and could understand him . <p> People often ask me what kinds of things I saw or heard in Louisiana during that time . They want to know about protests , sit-ins , draft cards being burned . The truth is , I hardly remember a thing . It was , I guess , pretty quiet at LSU , since the lecture by the young officer is practically my sole memory of anything related to the Vietnam War . <p> All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were treated to orange sherbet , compliments of the military . Then the officer began his lecture . " Hello , boys and girls of Louisiana State University Terrace Elementary School , " he boomed . " I just came back from a place called Saigon last month . Before that , I was in Chu Lai . I assume you have never heard those names before . Those cities are in a country called Vietnam , and I was fighting a war in Vietnam . I 'm here today to explain why we are fighting that war . <p> " First of all , war is n't as horrible as you might think . Even in the jungle , I had McDonald 's hamburgers for lunch . Of course , personally , I prefer Burger King , but you ca n't have everything . " <p> All the students in the cafeteria laughed , so I did , too . <p> " When we 're in the jungle , U.S. Army helicopters bring us everything we need , including all our meals , which are delicious . They are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVs , so we ca n't watch The Green Hornet or Mission : Impossible , but otherwise we live a pretty ordinary life , just like you 're living with your mommy and daddy . The only difference I can think of is that we have a task to fight the enemy . <p> " The Vietnamese are good people , but they 're very stupid . These Asians are about to be deprived of their homes , their money , even their lives by the Communists , but they ca n't defend themselves . They 're cowards . They 're weaklings , loose and slack . These Asians are so slack , they do n't take baths at all , and they 're always stinky . Can you imagine that ? They ca n't even take care of their own bodies ! Asian people are just not capable of improving themselves unless we Americans look after them . It 's an obligation and responsibility that we Americans have , and we should feel proud of ourselves for bearing this task . " <p> Each time the officer mentioned the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was one other Asian in the school , an Indian boy , but no one looked at him . <p> " Do n't worry , " Joan Elkins said , patting my hand . " None of us think you 're an Asian . " <p> I asked Mr. Rody , one of my father 's assistants in the laboratory , if eventually I would have to go to Vietnam if we stayed in America . Mr. Rody was a big , cheerful man , the son of a Texas rancher ; he was always kind to me , took me to places with his wife Jane on holidays . <p> " Who suggested such a thing ? " Mr. Rody asked . <p> I told him and Jane about the young officer 's lecture . <p> Jane sighed . " Do you have any reason to fight the Vietnamese ? " she asked me . <p> I said I really did n't understand what the Vietnamese were . <p> " Me neither , " Jane said . <p> Then Mr. Rody started talking about the Mexicans who crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father to visit my parents ' ranch . Then you could see for yourself . They wander around with their entire family and set up tents in the rocks . They 're always making all kinds of trouble , stealing cows even . You know what happens then ? " He lifted his hands , squinted one eye , and imitated the sound of a rifle report . <p> I asked him if the Mexicans were similar to the Vietnamese . <p> " I 'm not exactly sure , " he said . <p> Machiko-San She could n't speak any English at all , although she had been living in Baton Rouge for almost five years . She rented a house along a bank of the Mississippi River , an isolated residential area for whites who had come to the state to start fresh . Once these people obtained jobs , they moved to better neighborhoods as soon as they could , but Machiko remained . <p> She said she was from Niigata , an industrial seaport in Central Honshu , but my mother suspected she was actually from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Machiko used an expression which was indigenous to farmers . My mother 's own family had been poor . She had grown up on a farm near Namie , Fukushima , and as a little girl she had heard people call cooked rice either hito-take or futa-take ( first-cooked , second-cooked ) . Even today , whenever Machiko 's name comes up , Mother still makes a point of saying that Machiko must have been from a very rural area , citing those phrases , hito-take , futa-take , a distinction between fresh rice and recooked rice which only peasants need to make . <p> Machiko had met her husband , a pilot in the U.S. Air Force who was stationed in Japan , during the Korean War . They had four children , a boy and three girls , and then her husband died in a training accident . Machiko came to Baton Rouge to seek the support of her in-laws , but they refused her . They would n't admit a Japanese as a member of their family . Eventually they moved to Arkansas to evade her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the benefits provided by the Air Force . <p> " It 's too difficult for a woman with four children of mixed race to live in Japan , " she said . <p> I thought it strange that she could n't speak English . <p> " I used to understand it , more or less , but I 've forgotten it all now , " she told me . <p> I think she had simply decided to refuse the United States of America and everything about it , including its language , just as she had been refused . She would take the Air Force benefits , which were her due , but nothing else . <p> As soon as Machiko sent her children off to school in the morning , she would lock all the doors in the house and shut herself inside all day , waiting for them to return . Occasionally , in the evenings , she ventured out to do some shopping , but she needed an interpreter even for that simple task , and she did n't have a car , so she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her time on the telephone . <p> She would call my mother or Yoko and Yukie , the two other war brides in Baton Rouge , and she would talk and talk . Once she started , she did n't quit for three or four hours . <p> " She 's such a drag , " Yoko would say . <p> In the beginning of the summer in 1967 , a group from the prefectural assembly visited my father . The group , whose members belonged to the Opposition Party , had been invited to come to LSU by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Japan . On the last day of their visit , war brides became the topic of conversation at dinner . The assembly members said American soldiers who married yellow only chose yellow because they could n't get anyone to marry them in America . It was a national shame that Japanese women succumbed to them , they said . Children of mixed race were a " symbol of the disgrace of the war , " they said . The assembly members were relatively intelligent people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their last day , and they had completed all their work . <p> My father kicked them out of the house . <p> The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry subsequently received some complaints . My father was an entomologist , specializing in insects which harmed rice plants , and he had hoped to be a leader in this field of research . Eventually , he was forced to find another vocation . <p> I do n't remember much about Machiko 's three daughters  --  one was named Cindy , another Lucy , the third 's I 've forgotten  --  but Lenny , the son , the first-born , I remember very well . Whenever we went to New Orleans , my father invited Machiko 's family to accompany us , which made for a tight squeeze in the car , and my father liked having Lenny beside him as he drove , liked talking to him . Everyone  --  my parents , Yoko , Yukie  --  said Lenny was a loving , devoted son . He was always there for Machiko when something happened , when something important had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around his neighborhood , little kids collected scrap for pocket change , and I heard Lenny extorted money from them to give to his sisters . " He 's just like a little yakaza , a gangster , " I told my father . <p> My father told me that there were many things I could learn from Lenny , that maybe I should hang around him more . I knew there was a deeper meaning to this suggestion , but I still did n't like Lenny . <p> The last time I talked to him was in 1971 . We were living in Bangkok then , and one night he called my father . Lucy had been hit by a car . It had n't looked like she was seriously injured , so Machiko signed an affidavit to receive $2,000 , admitting that Lucy had ignored the red light as she was crossing the street . The truth was , the driver had ignored the light . Lenny had tried to keep Machiko from signing the affidavit , but Machiko had insisted they needed the money for Lucy 's medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lucy 's left eye was failing . Because of the affidavit , no lawyer would take the case . As a last resort , Lenny had called my father , who would go out of his way to help , contacting his old colleagues at LSU . <p> I got on the phone with Lenny that night . " What 's going on ? What happened ? " I asked him . <p> " Nothing , " he said coldly . <p> I remember him telling me something once . " I know what you Japanese think of my mom , " he had said to me . <p> We have n't heard from Machiko or her family since then . I do n't know how they 're doing at all . <p> Black School University Lake extended from the campus to the Protestant church near our apartment . On the campus shore was an arbor and a small , vaguely Oriental-looking garden . I had no idea what country in the Orient had such gardens . <p> " It 's Japanese , of course , " Mr. Rody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've seen them in Japan , have n't you ? " <p> Professor Newsome , who was the chairman of the agriculture department , thought it was a Chinese garden . <p> " It looks like Thai to me , " my father said . " It 's not Japanese , that 's for sure . " <p> Beside the arbor was a swamp , and from the yard of the Protestant church I could see a house trailer on a little patch of solid ground there  --  an island of sorts . An old white couple lived in the trailer . Mr. Rody told me they were Communists , antiwar activists . " They 're afraid the military 'll get them . That 's why they 're living there . If they need to escape , they can just jump in the lake , " he laughed . <p> I asked Mr. Rody what the people did for work . <p> " Collect empty bottles to sell . Fish in the lake . " <p> " That 's all ? " <p> " Yup . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any real Communists before . When they showed the hippies on the West Coast on TV , I thought they were Communists . <p> On the north side of the lake , on a little hill , was a city park . We were about half an hour from the closest black quarter , and most of the time , we hardly saw any blacks around the area at all . But once a month or so , groups of them ( they never came alone ) would show up at the park for barbecues . The congregation would swell , eventually number in the thousands , or so it seemed . Every time it happened , all the whites disappeared . The parties were lively , lasting until midnight on the hill surrounded by trees . The following morning , a garbage truck would be specially dispatched to pick up the refuse . <p> " If there were n't that many of them , they might get hurt , " my father told me . <p> I was confused . What did he mean ? <p> " This is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother repeatedly warned me not to go to the park when the blacks were having their barbecues . " When there 's only one person of a different race , " she said , " there 's no telling what might happen . " <p> People often inquire about the racism in Louisiana . I usually say that it 's true , it was severe . We saw and heard of many incidents , some of which had an indirect influence on us , but we were never badly harmed . I probably faced more discrimination when I returned to Japan  --  a foreigner in my own country . Except for on TV , I never saw the KKK . Even in Louisiana , I have to tell people , they do n't put on white hoods and costumes and just walk around . Some are disappointed to hear this . There 's always that tendency , I suppose , to think of the United States , especially the Deep South , as a place of significant and profound meaning . <p> After two years , the white school I attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the change until I started the new semester . Over the summer , the school policies had been amended , relaxing the admission standards , and the residents of the black quarter rushed to enroll their children : lunch cost only a dollar-fifty , and their kids could study where the white kids studied . What happened at the city park happened at Terrace Elementary School . Nearly all the white kids transferred out to private schools . <p> My father had heard about the policy change , but he had n't expected things to become so extreme . Professor Everett and his other colleagues tried to find a white school for me , but they were all full by that time . I stayed at Terrace . <p> I looked at my new classmates with curiosity . Compared to white girls , black girls seemed much more precocious , appeared to know much about life . They teased me shamelessly , putting their hands on their waists and wiggling their hips at me . The male students quickly established a hierarchical order of bosses , who never seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who spoke in low , barely understandable voices . <p> Once , our homeroom teacher had her car keys stolen during lunch . Mrs. Bush was a beautiful blond-haired lady from Alabama , a graduate student at the university , a recent bride . Carrying art supplies from her car to the building , she had left her keys in the car door , and when she came back , they were gone . She thought someone in our geology class , where she was having discipline problems , had taken them to spite her . <p> That afternoon , as she stretched to hang a map over the chalkboard , a student snapped a rubber band at her , hitting her slip , which peeked out from her skirt . She whipped around , her face reddening . " What 'd you do that for ? " she screamed . " Why , you junkyard dogs ! " <p> She glared at the black kids . " Give me my keys . They 're mine . I said give them to me ! " <p> No one said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks . Directly outside the window , a squirrel on an oak tree shook the Spanish moss , which resembled gray rags , and the classroom resounded with the dry little noise . <p> Suddenly Darcy May , who was sitting in the back , said , " Cedric , what were you doing by Mrs. Bush 's car , anyway ? " <p> Mrs. Bush pleaded , " Darcy May , please tell me what you know . " <p> " I 'd forgotten about it , " the girl said , " but I just remembered  --  " <p> Cedric Smith ran from his front seat and slapped Darcy May in the face . <p> " Stop that right now ! " Mrs. Bush said , grabbing Cedric 's arm . " You 're coming with me to the principal 's office . " <p> After they left , a boy , one of the bosses , said to Darcy May , " You know what 's going to happen , do n't you ? We ca n't do nothing at school , but we 'll get you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you of all your clothes and make you walk down the street , all naked . " <p> " You might as well take off her panties , too , " a girl said . " Show her cunt so no man will ever care for her . " <p> Darcy May began crying . <p> I do n't know if they really did such a horrible thing to her , but something like that happened nearly every day . It was n't rare to see torn clothes , noses or mouths bleeding . I could n't believe these were the fights of elementary school students . There were both male and female gangs , and they were very exclusive . The school had not been an exclusive place when it had been a white school . <p> I became friendly with a black boy named Richard . I 've forgotten his last name , but I remember that everyone called him by his middle name , Carl . He said he had a second middle name as well . He seemed so proud of all his names , I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . <p> Carl was considered harmless . He did n't belong to any of the gangs , and no one took him seriously . He carried around a box with his collection of miniature cars inside , and during recess he would open the box and line the cars up in a row , beaming . He was always congenial to me , except for the one time I asked him what his father did : he said he owned a shoe store and then told me not to ask anything more . <p> After school one day , I rode with him in his mother 's car to visit their house in the black quarter . They lived on a gentle slope behind a tall building which was under construction . All the houses were flat and wooden , in disarray , spread out to hug the shore of the river , painted either white or turquoise . <p> There was a skinny lady with white hair sitting on Carl 's porch . She stared at me . " Who is that ? " she asked sharply . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " From school ? " <p> " Yeah . He 's Japanese . " <p> " Who cares , " she said . <p> Carl told me the woman was his grandmother , and that she had been a dancer as a young woman . <p> " Tell Becky to get rid of that honeycomb , " she yelled as we opened the screen door to the house . " You got to get on her or she 'll never do it . " <p> " I 've got three sisters . Becky 's the oldest . She 's a big pain in the butt , " Carl said . <p> He showed me his collection of cars . I had a keen interest in automobiles when I lived in America . Both Carl and I liked the old-fashioned models , big , showy ones with fins , and he had quite a few miniatures of them . Some of the small towns outside of Baton Rouge held demolition derbies , cars with all kinds of stickers and decorations performing battle royal , and it seemed a shame to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Carl and I were looking at his collection , people gathered at the door . Some even entered his room , which smelled like paint thinner , to scrutinize me . <p> " He 's Japanese , " his grandmother said . " Could you tell ? Looks like a Chinese , but I knew he was Japanese from the first moment I saw him . " <p> Carl smirked . His grandmother had rounded up the neighbors for a look-see at the Asian boy . <p> In the meantime , my mother and father had found out I 'd gone to the black quarter . All the elementary school students were supposed to take the bus unless their parents were picking them up , and the school bus driver had noticed I was missing . The principal asked if anyone knew where I was . <p> " Harry ? He went off with Carl , " someone said . Several students had seen me getting into Carl 's mother 's car . The principal called my mother , who could n't really understand what was being said . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , to be alarmed , and she tried to reach my father at the laboratory . He was n't available ; he was in the middle of a lecture . She contacted Professor Kim , a Korean who knew Japanese . He learned what was going on and alerted my father . <p> Professor Newsome was furious . He had Mr. Rody and Jane recruit some black students , thinking they 'd be helpful when they came to fetch me in the black quarter . He also called the police . Later , he severely scolded me , saying the police officer had yelled to him , " What kind of child is this ? " <p> But by that time , I was on my way home . Carl 's grandmother had summoned the rest of the family to take a look at me , and Carl 's brother-in-law , who 'd just finished working at the ice cream factory , immediately voiced concern . <p> " This is not good , " he said . " The police 'll bug us about this . " <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And besides , he 's not even white . " <p> " Yeah , I 'm not white , " I said . <p> " It do n't matter , it 's not gon na do us any good , " he said , looking at me . <p> He drove me home , or close to my home ( he told me it was a little difficult for him to go into my neighborhood and dropped me off nearby ) . He gave me a note for my parents , which explained that my going there had been an unfortunate , careless mistake , and all parties concerned should be careful not to let it happen again . <p> Everyone was grateful that I was safe . Professor Kim even admired the responsibility shown by Carl 's brother-in-law , but Professor Newsome was exasperated , angrier than I 'd ever seen him . He had urged my father to transfer me to a white school from the start . " I never thought you could be such a fool , " he said . <p> My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently than anyone else , like he did . <p> " You should 've taught him not to associate with them at all , not to talk to them even if they talk to him , " Professor Newsome said . " That 's what you have to do if he 's going to go to a school with black kids . " <p> " My son is n't going to spend the rest of his life in Louisiana . Is n't that a little too much to ask of him ? " <p> " Listen , do n't disparage our customs . I 've never disparaged yours , have I ? " Professor Newsome told him . " What you just said is n't relevant , anyway . Ca n't you understand what kind of danger your son was in ? " <p> My mother put the ice cream which Carl 's brother-in-law had given to me into the trash can . <p> I thought about the conversation I had had with the brother-in-law on the drive home . He had asked me why I had n't switched schools like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , did n't they ? " <p> " There 're still some white kids there . Not that many , though . " The few children remaining had n't been able to afford a transfer . <p> " What about you ? Why did n't your parents get you out ? " <p> " I 'm not really sure . I guess they did n't think there 'd be so many black kids all of a sudden . I guess they did n't think they really had to move me to another school . " <p> He turned on the radio . Nat King Cole sang " Time and the River . " The brother-in-law was silent for a while , then asked , " How long is your family gon na stay here ? You gon na live here forever ? " <p> " We 're going back to Japan sometime . I do n't know when exactly . " <p> " Well , this is n't my job , it 's your parents ' , but I want to tell you something . I want you to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at me as we drove alongside the river . " You got ta decide where you stand .

Let 's say if you decide never to talk to Carl  --  that 's okay , that ca n't be helped . I 'll talk to Carl about it . " <p> " Why do I have to decide ?
