<p> Wayne 's World - that Americanization of the National Hockey League in the 1980s - eventually must revolve around and resolve life without Wayne Gretzky , soon to be 30 . <p> " Wayne coming to Los Angeles made hockey a U.S. national sport . And that 's very exciting for the NHL , because the ' 90s is the decade of expansion , " said Robert Moor , the Kings ' vice president of marketing/administration . <p> Moor and others hope the popularity and excitement The Great One wrought will endure in the ' 90s , the decade Gretzky likely will hang up his skates . He has n't set a date , but marketing people know they must cultivate U.S. fans beyond the Gretzky generation . <p> " Wayne 'll be a tremendous loss , " said Mike Emrick , TV and cable voice of the Philadelphia Flyers and the NHL 's SportsChannel America coverage . " The marketing people in Los Angeles will have a real task , and so will the league , unless he 's replaced . " <p> NHL masterminds already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important in the ' 90s , because that superstar quality is held by very few , " said Susie Mathieu , marketing/ public relations vice president for the St. Louis Blues . <p> " Gretzky , Mario Lemieux , now Brett Hull , they put people in the arena . Fans like that affinity with players and high performance . " <p> Gordie Howe first got the attention of U.S. fans , but the NHL had only six teams during much of his playing time and TV coverage was virtually nil . <p> Gretzky solidified that affinity in the age of cable TV , drawing U.S. fans to a fast-paced sport matching today 's fast-paced lifestyle . <p> To wit , the NHL 's regular-season attendance in the ' 80s increased 17% . <p> " You need three things : credibility , excitement , value for the entertainment dollar . Gretzky gave us all three , " said Bill Barnes , marketing/public relations vice president for the Hartford Whalers . <p> " Americans are finally realizing that hockey is one of the most exciting games being offered . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product just like Procter &; Gamble or U.S. Steel . We 're very thematic in Hartford . Our slogan is , ' Watch us kick ice . ' " <p> The Blues also are in the midst of a marketing switch , riding the wave of enthusiasm Hull is generating . <p> " We have tried to position hockey ... as entertainment , to look at those discretionary entertainment dollars as our goal , " Mathieu said . <p> " We went with plans like ' put your nights on ice ' or ' a night out with the boys , ' as opposed to ' let 's talk about hockey . ' Now , we let that ' H ' word creep into our plans . Player profiles are built more into our strategy . " <p> And clubs have taken profiles of their fans , with some surprising results : <p> - More than 25% earn at least $ 50,000 annually . <p> - More than 50% are college-educated . <p> - More than 70% own homes . <p> " One advertiser we were trying to get called our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckling . <p> But the strategies must be working , on and off the ice . The Washington Capitals went from a franchise struggling to stay afloat in the early ' 80s , with a base of 3,000 fans , to 8,200 full-season and 5,000 partial-season ticketholders . <p> Becoming regulars in the playoffs certainly was important to the Caps . But so was the persistence of marketing . <p> " I used to say hockey in Washington in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s was about educating people . What they knew about ice was ( that ) you used it to pour bourbon over , " said Lew Strudler , the Caps ' marketing vice president . <p> " We became very aggressive with our marketing . Washington is a city of winners . If you win in government , you come to Washington ; if you leave office , you lose . That 's how we marketed , a winning team on ice as well as off . " <p> And the ' 90s expansion teams - San Jose , Calif. , Tampa and Ottawa - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " The difference now is that the league set goals ahead of time . That 's good , because you have to know your city , " Strudler said . " We were awarded a team , and a year later we were on the street trying to sell tickets . Now they see if fans in a city want the team first . Even so , no new team is going to come in and have an easy opportunity to make money . You have to work at it . " <p> What helps , though , is using Gretzky as a magnet . <p> That 's also what 's scary about a future without him . <p> " What will help is the notion of having two American teams in the Stanley Cup final ( not done since ' 81 ) , " Emrick said . " That would be a tremendous boon for even the major networks . " <p> The NHL also hopes today 's youth will become tomorrow 's paying fans . <p> " The biggest impact Wayne has had is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Moor said . " You need to add American youth to the repertoire , to give them hockey heroes . That 's what adds up to the future .
