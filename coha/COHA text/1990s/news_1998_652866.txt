<p> It 's show night on Stage Nine at Studio City , and up in the bleachers above the familiar New York apartment set , the comic warming up the audience gets a big laugh when he calls himself " The **28;365;TOOLONG man ! " <p> If Jerry Seinfeld has any regrets about his decision to turn down the biggest financial deal ever offered a television star and to shut down production on the most popular sitcom of the 1990 's , he certainly is n't showing it as he prepares to film the first of the final 10 episodes of " Seinfeld . " <p> " We have a wonderful episode tonight , " he promises the 200 or so audience members . " It 's called ' The Cartoon , ' and it 's episode No. 169 . " <p> The episode , which is to be broadcast tonight on NBC , is a classic " Seinfeld " melange of high-pitched dialogue and cross-referenced interaction among four familiar , utterly self-absorbed Manhattanites . In this episode Elaine ( Julia Louis-Dreyfus ) , baffled by a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a cartoonist herself ; Kramer ( Michael Richards ) , upset by his propensity for offending people with unchecked comments , decides to stop speaking altogether ; George ( Jason Alexander ) becomes unhinged when Elaine and Kramer say his new girlfriend looks alarmingly like Jerry , and Jerry himself is unhinged because a successful performance artist is denigrating him as the devil . <p> One audience member asks Mr. Seinfeld to list some of his favorite episodes . " I do n't really have favorites per se , " he says . " They 're all my babies . I always like the one we 're doing . I like this one tonight . I think it 's very funny . " <p> " Very funny " remains the sole criterion for Mr. Seinfeld in measuring his series . It was the goal that moved him to create this unconventional sitcom nine years ago , though the NBC executives who somewhat reluctantly ordered it did n't get it . It continues to be the focus of his work both as the show 's producer and head writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step off the stage at the end of this season , confident " that we would be leaving them laughing , " he said . The " Seinfeld " set is relaxed and casual , a reflection of the star himself , who is wearing his usual open-necked shirt , jeans and sneakers . He steps down from the bleachers and drifts among the writers and technicians . He is , he says , " feeling great " about his decision , and about the enormous outpouring of affection for the show in the weeks since he made it public in December . <p> On the sprawling stage , the only two permanent sets are Jerry 's apartment  --  blue couch in the middle , kitchen counter stage right  --  and the interior of Monk 's Restaurant , the coffee shop where the characters hang out . <p> Before he joins the other cast members at one of the booths , Mr. Seinfeld watches a first scene that has already been filmed on the street that the show uses for its outdoor New York scenes . It sets up the premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George 's late fiancee , Susan , has turned to acting but is so awful she ought to quit the profession . When the woman immediately meets them in the street , Kramer promptly informs her that she stinks and should quit . <p> The laughs begin to cascade from the bleachers , much to the pleasure of Howard West and George Shapiro , Mr. Seinfeld 's managers and executive producers on the show . They are show business veterans , having managed such talent as Carl Reiner and Robert Wuhl . " Jerry is totally committed to make the last 10 shows as good as the best of what we 've done , " says Mr. West , tall , white-haired and exuberant . <p> Mr. Shapiro , shorter and equally energetic , seconds that immediately . " He wants to go out on a roll . " Then he adds , with a little laugh , " I think the NBC executives were totally shocked that he 'd walk away from that much money . " <p> Of course , Mr. Seinfeld and his partners in the show have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sneakers , Porsches and whatever else they want for the rest of their lives . The syndication money will continue to flow , perhaps indefinitely . <p> Nobody on the set is expressing any regret about the end of production . The show 's other stars all make clear that they 're comfortable with the prospect of ending what is likely to be an unmatchable high point of their careers . <p> Most of the crew members conscientiously allow Mr. Richards , known for his intense concentration on show nights , a lot of space . But he takes a moment to say hello in exceptionally cordial terms and expresses his gratitude for all the show has brought to him . <p> Ms. Louis-Dreyfus and Mr. Alexander sit together in director 's chairs just off the set and share a laugh over some suggestions in news accounts that they were surprised or upset by Mr. Seinfeld 's Christmas Day closing notice . <p> " We were totally together on it , " Ms. Louis-Dreyfus says . " It 's what we all wanted . It 's certainly what I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations last spring that led to speculation that the show would not return this season . The cast members were holding out for a huge salary increase , which they felt was warranted considering how much money so many others , including the production company , Castle Rock , and the network , NBC , had made on the show . <p> Neither Mr. Alexander or Ms. Louis-Dreyfus has plans to jump into another show . " I just do n't think the public would accept me as another character right away , " Mr. Alexander says . " Not with the reruns out there playing twice a night . " <p> A half-hour " Seinfeld " script can run up to 70 pages , which is about 20 pages longer than the normal hourlong show . Each episode is dense with dialogue and action , a long list of very short scenes . The point of every scene : get in fast and be funny . <p> In the coffee shop , Jerry expresses dismay that Kramer has offended the aspiring actress . Kramer argues that he just told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stink , " Jerry says , " And she should quit . But it should n't be because of me . It should be the traditional route : years of rejection and failure until she 's spit out the bottom of the porn industry . " <p> The line gets a huge laugh . <p> After the end of the scene , as he does after every scene , Mr. Seinfeld huddles with his staff of writers , six to eight young men : all men at the moment , though it has not always been all male . <p> The show is rewritten as it goes along , with Mr. Seinfeld inserting new lines in almost every retake . In one scene , where Elaine confronts a co-worker who thinks he understands the cartoon , the writers want to try a new line in a second take to finish the scene with a better laugh . Mr. Seinfeld says to go for it . <p> The line hits big . Mr. Seinfeld shrugs as if to say , " What do you know ? " <p> The plot involving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy Griffin , is another familiar " Seinfeld " writing device : a slice of the comedian 's real life . Ms. Griffin who is also a regular on the NBC comedy " Suddenly Susan , " had an earlier appearance on " Seinfeld , " playing a woman asked to deliver a package for Jerry . <p> She went on to use the experience of filming a " Seinfeld " as part of her stand-up act , in which she satirically mocked Mr. Seinfeld . He saw her do the bit on an HBO special , and a new plot line was born . <p> The cartoon plot line came from the life of the episode 's writer , Bruce Kaplan , who was once a cartoonist for The New Yorker . In one scene , Jerry and Kramer take turns writing their own captions for Elaine 's cartoon , which depicts a pig at a complaint department , and they draw the biggest laughs in the show . <p> The laughs are so big , in fact , that they eventually become a problem . The actors have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next lines , and so the show is running almost preposterously long . " We 're at about 32 minutes , " one writer tells another , with two scenes still to go . <p> The show is supposed to run only 22 minutes on the air , although , one writer notes , NBC often allows " Seinfeld " to run a full minute long , taking the time out of the next show . But 32 minutes ? The episode will have to be tightly crunched in editing . Still , the writer concedes , some scenes will surely have to be cut entirely . <p> The audience leaves at about 11:45 P.M. The cast and crew members stick around . They have to shoot some retakes called pick-ups . But Mr. Seinfeld remains completely fresh . <p> There are nine half-hours to go , but that only means seven different episodes , because the finale is now planned to be an a hour , and one other show will be a compendium show of some kind , though Mr. Seinfeld says he has decided not to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last one , sure to be the most watched television episode since the finale of " Cheers " five years ago , and maybe since the finale of " M*A*S*H " 15 years ago ? <p> " Oh , Larry and I have that pretty much worked out , " Mr. Seinfeld says of Larry David , his friend and writing partner , with whom he created the series . Mr. David left the show before the start of last season but will return to write the finale with Mr. Seinfeld . <p> They will try to keep the not-at-all bitter end a surprise , Mr. Seinfeld says . <p> " We 're going to shoot the episode here , but clear out the audience for that final scene .
