The California gnatcatcher , a warbler-like songbird , nests along the coastal sage land in Southern California 's Orange County , which happens to be some of the most expensive real estate on earth . Last July , when the state fish and game commission announced that it would consider listing the gnatcatcher as an endangered species , developers bulldozed hundreds of acres of the birds ' remaining habitat so that the land would be exempt from any future protection . In September the fish and game commission , bowing to construction-industry arguments that protecting the gnatcatcher would cost the state $20 billion and 200,000 jobs , decided not to list the bird . Environmentalists hope the Federal Government may yet do so . <P> So went the latest chapter in the often brutal conflict between development and protection of the environment in the increasingly tarnished Golden State . California leads the nation with 283 endangered , threatened or rare species , but despite various state and federal forms of protection , two-thirds of these species continue to decline . <P> This destruction is occurring despite a concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly 90% of the state 's communities have imposed some form of restraint on growth , but urban and suburban subdivisions keep sprawling . The legislature passed laws in 1973 to ensure sustainable management of the forests , but timber companies have replanted new species instead of maintaining existing forests and have cut too often to permit the forest to regenerate itself . And though Los Angeles has made progress against smog , air quality has plummeted in other parts of the state . <P> Frustrated with the legislature 's inability  --  or unwillingness  --  to get the job done , citizens have passed ballot initiatives to protect the 1,100- mile coastline , establish a fund to buy habitat for mountain lions , and authorize a bond issue to provide funding for parks and wildlife habitat . But enforcement of these laws has been so ineffectual that some enviros ( as they are called in California ) have turned to the courts , suing to protect the delta smelt , salmon and other species . More radical groups like Earth First ! resort to direct action : blockading logging sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to cut . <P> Now the conflict over diminishing resources is scrambling the political map of California . Traditional allies such as agriculture and big developers frequently find themselves at odds . Some environmental groups have aligned with cities against agricultural interests to try to break big farmers ' stranglehold on water supplies . Others have joined forces with surfers to fight pollution from pulp-paper mills and with commercial fisherman to end logging practices that destroy watersheds . <P> As an unending tide of new arrivals pushes nature to the wall , California is awash with experiments to preserve its stunning natural heritage . The Wilson administration wants to establish regional councils that would draw representatives from all interests with a stake in an area in order to reach a consensus on how to protect different biological regions . Says Larry Orman , executive director of the Greenbelt Alliance : " Because we have such massive problems , I view California as a mirror to the future .
