There have been many tales of atrocity and murder in the chilling course of the war in Bosnia . But few stories match the horror of an alleged incident reported late last month for the first time : the massacre in August of more than 200 Muslim men and boys by Bosnian Serb militia at the edge of a ravine near Travnik . Like some other Balkan tales , this one is impossible to verify independently . Bosnia 's Muslim authorities claim to have details , but Serb leader Radovan Karadzic says he knows nothing of a massacre . In the meantime , one escapee , Semir K. , 24 , shivered with vivid memory as he poured out this account of the evening of Aug. 21 : <P> Five of us  --  me , my three brothers and my 18-year-old nephew  --  survived the " ethnic cleansing " of Muslims from the town of Carakovo in mid-June by hiding in the bushes . We stayed around there for 10 days or so , until we really had nothing left to eat . Then my older brother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Serbian military police picked us up , questioned us at the Keraterm ceramics factory and then took us to a camp at Trnopolje . They beat us until there was blood coming from our noses and mouths . We were in the camp for about a month . <P> At about 8 o'clock in the morning on Aug. 21 , the Serbs brought five city buses to Trnopolje . Women and children filled about half of one , and they ordered men to fill the rest . There were some people who wanted to go ; others were scared . But we had hope because they told us the buses were under the protection of the United Nations forces in Croatia and were heading for the Croatian border . As we were getting on , my sister-in-law pleaded that she and my 16-year-old nephew be let on too . One of my brothers stayed behind . <P> When we turned away from the Croatian border , we still thought the U.N . would meet us . Instead three dump trucks joined us . There was one van in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soldier with an automatic weapon . At Skender Vakuf , they told us we were passing the front lines , so we should lie down and not look out the windows . <P> When we came to what I later knew to be the Ugar River , they took us all out and said not to worry , we were going to be exchanged for Serb prisoners . They got everyone out of the buses and the trucks , which also had prisoners in them , and lined us all up along the edge of the road , between the buses and the river . They chose about 250 people , all men between about 16 and 50 , and put us back on two buses . We still thought we were heading for a prisoner exchange . <P> After half an hour , we stopped . It was very quiet . Then a soldier came in and pointed to a man at the front and said , " You . " They got out , and we heard a single shot . Then another Serb came in and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " More shots . Then we realized it was over , there was no life for us . They started taking people by threes , and we heard machine-gun bursts along with pistol shots . <P> I was in the middle of the bus . When it was about my turn , they opened the back door and started taking people from there too . My brother and my younger nephew were taken out , and we heard the shots . The guard nudged me with his rifle butt and told me to take two with me . As I rose for the door , I thought my other brother , Sakib , was with me . But then I tilted my head and saw him and my older nephew lying on the floor , crying .
