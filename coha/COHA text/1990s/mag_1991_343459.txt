As a literary phenomenon , there is less to Nancy Reagan than meets the eye . Kitty Kelley is hardly the only slash-and-burn chronicler currently at work . Her smartest move has been to choose living victims for her killer bios ; speaking ill of the dead ( Albert Goldman on Elvis and John Lennon , Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington on Pablo Picasso ) is profitable but a tad less sensational . And the instant renown achieved by Kelley 's Nancy does not really signal the end of civilization as we have known it . Good , balanced , substantial biographies about controversial figures continue to appear and win notice . Last week Jackson Pollock : An American Saga , written by two obscure authors , won a Pulitzer Prize . <P> Still , these are undeniably salad days for people interested in reading about scandal in high places . Never mind that this has been true for roughly the past 3,000 years . What of the adultery between a queen and a prince that launched a 10-year war and ruined a nation ? The Iliad is the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King David of Israel . One day , while strolling on his rooftop , he spied a woman bathing and summoned her ( nudge , wink ) to his royal presence . After Bathsheba told him she had become pregnant , the King 1 ) tried to trick her husband , a loyal if unimaginative soldier , into sleeping with his wife and 2 ) when that failed , arranged for the unwitting cuckold to be placed in optimum jeopardy during a battle with the Ammonites . Shocking stuff , told with no holds barred in the Old Testament . <P> For random polymorphous perversity , it would be hard to top The Twelve Caesars by Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus ( born circa A.D. 69 ) . A classic capital insider , Suetonius served as chief secretary to the Emperor Hadrian and wrote a number of books that certainly sound like best sellers , most of them , unfortunately , now lost . Connoisseurs of the carnal particularly lament the disappearance of his Lives of Famous Whores . But The Twelve Caesars still packs plenty of punch per sesterce : Augustus as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them procured for him by his wife ; Tiberius training young boys , whom he dubbed his " minnows , " to nibble at him lasciviously during his swims . <P> So there is nothing new about biographies that portray the bad or disreputable along with the good . Outrageous conduct might incur punishment somewhere down the line , but that was an important part of the story . Men could lead mighty armies , forge tribes into nations and still behave like swine ; women could embody all the public virtues and pieties and then drop poison into wine goblets or turn into manipulative she-devils in the boudoir . Of course . What else is new ?
