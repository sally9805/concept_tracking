On Earth , black holes are everywhere . The national debt is a black hole . The savings-and-loan mess is a black hole . A friend of mine recently claimed his graduate thesis was also a black hole . " It sucks up all my time , all my energy , all my happiness , " he said . " And there 's no escaping it . " In our Galaxy , however , black holes are much harder to find . For most of the last twenty years , astronomers had good evidence for only one stellar black hole in the entire Galaxy : a source of X rays in the constellation Cygnus called Cygnus X-1 . Now , though , astronomers have uncovered a much better candidate or a black hole in our Galaxy . It lies in the constellation Monoceros some three or four thousand light-years away and bears the prosaic name A0620-00 . The A refers to Ariel V , the X-ray satellite that first detected the object , and the numbers refer to the object 's right ascension and declination . A0620-00 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and X rays . Observations soon revealed that A0620-00 was a binary consisting of an orange dwarf star and a dark companion . Astronomers continue to observe the object and recent studies of the orange dwarf 's motion around the dark star indicate that the dark star must be a black hole . Despite its less appealing name , A0620-00 is a better candidate for a black hole than Cygnus X-1 . LIGHT-DEVOURING HOLES IN SPACE A black hole is an object with so much gravity that nothing can escape it  --  not even light , the fastest thing in the universe . Anything approaching a black hole gets pulled into the object and disappears as if it fell into a hole . Because even light can not escape , the hole appears black . Gravity is the key to a black hole 's immense power . The black hole 's strong gravity keeps captured material from escaping . Of course , every planet , moon , and star has gravity . Earth has enough gravity that you have to travel faster than 11 kilometers per second to overcome the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity . The gravity of Jupiter is even stronger : its escape velocity is 60 kms per second . A black hole has so much gravity that to escape one you would have to travel faster than the speed of light , 300,000 kms per second . But traveling faster than light is impossible , so once you get into a black hole you ca n't get out . The gravitational force you feel on the surface of a planet depends on both the planet 's mass and its radius . The greater the mass , the stronger the gravity and the greater the escape velocity . Less obviously , the smaller the radius , the stronger the gravity and the greater the escape velocity , too . The reason : you are then standing closer to the planet 's center , so the gravitational pull on you is stronger and you have to travel faster to escape . Anything can become a black hole if you compress it enough . For example , if Earth were the same mass it is now but had only one-fourth its present radius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be twice what it is now . If you compressed Earth still further , the escape velocity would get still higher . If Earth 's diameter shrank to less than one centimeter , the escape velocity would exceed the speed of light . Earth , of course , will never become a black hole , nor will the Sun . When the Sun runs out of fuel , it will collapse and form a white dwarf . But when a very massive star runs out of fuel , it collapses and forms a black hole . Like the Sun , most stars support their huge weights by generating energy . This energy keeps the stars warm , and the pressure of the warm gas holds the stars up against their own gravity . Someday , though , a star exhausts its fuel . Without its energy source , the star can no longer hold itself up against the pull of its own gravity and so the star collapses . A star with an initial mass below eight solar masses collapses into a white dwarf star . White dwarfs hold themselves up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star 's electrons on each other . There is a limit to how much pressure electrons can exert , however , and that limit is exceeded if the white dwarf 's mass is above 1.4 solar masses . White dwarfs more massive than 1.4 solar masses therefore can not exist . But all stars with initial masses below eight solar masses lose so much mass during their lives that they form white dwarfs with masses under 1.4 solar masses . In fact , the average mass of a white dwarf is only 0.6 solar mass . What happens if a star is born with more than eight solar masses ? After the star runs out of fuel , the outer portion explodes , forcing the core of the star to collapse . The remaining star exceeds 1.4 solar masses and so can not form a white dwarf . Instead , as the star collapses , its electrons and protons smash together to form neutrons , and a neutron star is born . Whereas the mutual repulsion between its electrons supports a white dwarf , the mutual repulsion between neutrons supports a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the Galaxy . Some neutron stars make their presence known because they are pulsars , emitting periodic pulses of radio waves and/or X rays . As with white dwarfs , there is a limit to how much mass a neutron star can have . If the collapsing star exceeds two or three solar masses ( the exact figure is unknown , but depends upon the interaction between the neutrons ) , the star 's gravity overwhelms the support the neutrons provide . In a fraction of a second , the star shrinks . As the star gets smaller , its surface gravity gets stronger and the escape velocity climbs higher until it exceeds the speed of light . The star has now become a black hole . Which stars form black holes ? Again , astronomers do not know the precise answer . Most stars with initial masses above eight solar masses probably form neutron stars rather than black holes , but the most massive stars of all  --  stars born with masses above about 40 Suns  --  probably form black holes . HOW TO FIND A BLACK HOLE Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , your goal as a black-hole hunter is to find a dark object whose mass exceeds three solar masses . Then you know you have a black hole . But finding a black hole is tough for two reasons . First , black holes obviously radiate no light . Second , the stars that eventually become black holes are quite rare . Fewer than one star in ten million has a mass exceeding 40 solar masses . Thus , black holes must be rare . Yet , of the billions of stars in our Galaxy , several thousand of them should become black holes . Because black holes are black , a black hole isolated in space is probably impossible to discover . But if a normal star orbits the black hole , we can detect the gravitational influence of the black hole by noticing that the normal star circles an unseen companion . Such binary systems call attention to themselves if the black hole grabs material from the normal star . The material spirals into the black hole like water going down a drain . Before this material takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the black hole called an accretion disk . The accretion disk is extremely hot and emits X rays , which astronomers can detect . The accretion disk is hot because material is falling into it . Whenever something falls , it heats up : water falling through Hoover dam , for example , is one degree warmer at the bottom than at the top . The energy released by the falling water is converted into heat . Material falling into the accretion disk of a black hole gets heated by gravity  --  and by friction  --  and since the gravity is so strong , the temperature rises above a million degrees . Because it is so hot , the accretion disk radiates X rays . That was how Cygnus X-1 was found . CYGNUS X-1 In the 1960s , astronomers noticed X rays coming from a region in Cygnus and named the source Cygnus X-1 . In 1971 , they found that the X-ray source coincided with a normal 9th-magnitude star called HDE 226868 . This star had been catalogued years before as a blue star of spectral type O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the low-mass stars that make up most of our Galaxy . Still , O stars are not that unusual and several are even visible to the naked eye . But HDE 226868 was unusual . Astronomers measured the star 's velocity and found that the star revolved around something every 5.6 days . But the companion of HDE 226868 turned out to be dark and invisible . By assuming the O star has a high mass , as most other O stars do , astronomers concluded that in order to perturb the O star , the dark star had to exceed three solar masses . Cygnus X-1 was likely a black hole . But it was not a definite black hole because the dynamics of the binary system say only that the dark companion must exceed 0.25 solar masses . The argument that the dark star exceeds three solar masses depends on our assuming the O star has a high mass . If the O star has less mass than usual or its spectral type  --  as do many stars in X-ray binary systems  --  then the unseen companion could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some astronomers have constructed models of Cygnus X-1 in which the dark companion is only a neutron star rather than a black hole . When dealing with exotic objects like black holes , astronomers want absolute proof . Cygnus X-1 probably is a black hole . But the dark star could have less than three solar masses , so Cygnus X-1 does not give us the proof we desire . Now , though , astronomers have found a perfect black hole , a dark star whose mass definitely exceeds three solar masses : A0620-00 . AN X-RAY OUTBURST IN MONOCEROS On August 3 , 1975 , the British satellite Ariel V detected a source of X rays in the constellation Monoceros , near its border with Orion . The source , A0620-00 , rapidly intensified : on August 5 , it surpassed the strength of the Crab Nebula ; shortly after , it exceeded Cygnus X-1 ; and on August 8 , it outdid Scorpius X-1 , the strongest X-ray source in the night sky . For nearly two months , the object remained brighter than any other X-ray source except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the position of A0620-00 . Photographs taken at Palomar Observatory in 1955 indicated the star was normally reddish and 18th magnitude . So the X-ray outburst coincided with an optical nova , which was named V616 Monocerotis . Searching astronomical archives , astronomers found that the nova had erupted before . In November 1917 it attained 12th magnitude , but no one had noticed it . Later examination of old sky patrol plates at Harvard University revealed the nova 's outburst . The light and X rays of A0620-00 eventually faded . Today an 18th-magnitude orange star lies in this place . The star is a dwarf of spectral type K5 , somewhat fainter , cooler , and smaller than the Sun . These stars are common ( about 15 percent of all stars in our Galaxy ) so we know a lot about them . If the orange dwarf in the A0620-00 system is a normal K5 dwarf , it has a mass around 0.7 solar mass and an intrinsic brightness five to ten percent that of the Sun . Since its apparent magnitude is 18 , astronomers estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four thousand light-years . But A0620-00 is not a normal orange dwarf . It circles a black hole . A PERFECT BLACK HOLE As the X-ray outburst proved , there was more to the A0620-00 system than just an orange dwarf . After the outburst faded , observations revealed that the K star contributes only about half the total visible light the system emits . The other half comes from a hot accretion disk surrounding the orange star 's unseen partner . In 1983 , Jeff McClintock of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and colleagues reported that the orange dwarf 's brightness varies 0.2 magnitude every 7.75 hours , which indicates the star revolves around something every 7.75 hours . Twice during each revolution , the star 's brightness , as observed on Earth , reaches a maximum ; twice it reaches a minimum . McClintock and colleagues suggested the orange dwarf varies in apparent brightness because it is not spherical . Instead , the intense gravity of the dark companion distorts the orange dwarf into an egg shape . As the orange dwarf orbits around its companion , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarf presents different profiles to us , varying the brightness as seen from Earth ( see diagram on opposite page ) . ( Diagram omitted ) Twice during each revolution , we view the eggshaped star sideways and its apparent brightness attains a maximum ; twice during each revolution , we view the star end-on and its apparent brightness reaches a minimum . What was the orange dwarf 's companion ? A black hole or just another neutron star ? To find out , astronomers had to determine the mass of the dark star by studying the orange dwarf 's orbit . If the dark star 's mass exceeds three times the Sun 's , the companion must be a black hole . Unfortunately , the orbital period of the binary system as found from brightness variations does not reveal by itself the mass of the dark companion . Astronomers also need to know the separation between the dark star and the orange dwarf . For a given period , the greater the separation , the greater the mass must be . For example , if a star has a planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit  --  the distance from the Sun to Earth  --  from the star , then the star must have exactly the same mass as the Sun . If , on the other hand , a planet completes an orbit once a year but lies two astronomical units from the star , the star must be eight times more massive than the Sun . Two stars in a binary like A0620-00 actually circle their center of mass , which lies between them , instead of orbiting one another . The binary 's center of mass is the place where you would put a fulcrum to balance a giant seesaw holding one star at each end . The center of mass , therefore , always lies closer to the more massive star . For example , if one star has ten times the mass of the other , the center of mass lies a tenth as far from the high-mass star as from the low-mass star . In the case of A0620-00 , the center of mass lies closer to the dark star than to the orange dwarf because the dark star has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolves about this center of mass and so does the dark star . But because the center of mass lies closer to the dark star , the dark star does not move as much as the orange dwarf does . The total separation between the dark star and the orange dwarf  --  which will tell us the dark star 's mass  --  is the same as the distance of the dark star from the center of mass plus the distance of the orange dwarf from the center of mass . But we can not see the separation between the two objects as we could if they were a nearby double star . Nevertheless , in 1986 , McClintock and Ronald Remillard ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) put a lower limit on the separation between the dark star and the orange dwarf , which in turn puts a lower limit on the dark star 's mass : 3.2 solar masses , suggestions that the dark star was indeed a black hole . McClintock and Remillard achieved this feat by measuring the line-of-sight velocity of the orange dwarf . As the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches us and its light is blueshifted and , at other times , recedes from us and its light is redshifted . McClintock and Remillard measured these blueshifts and redshifts to find that the line-of-sight velocity , like the brightness , varies every 7.75 hours , confirming that the star completes an orbit every 7.75 hours . Furthermore , McClintock and Remillard found that the maximum velocity the orange dwarf attains is huge : 460 kms per second . For comparison , the Earth revolves around the Sun at only 30 kms per second . The orange dwarf 's velocity and the orbital period constrain the separation o the orange dwarf from the center of mass . If we view the binary edge-on , then the line-of-sight velocity and the period tell us how far the orange dwarf travels during a single orbit . This distance is simply the circumference of its orbit . The orbit 's circumference then tells us the radius of the orbit  --  that is , the separation between the K star and the center of mass . The separation turns out to be 0.0136 AU . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that planet would circle the Sun once every 13.9 hours . Because the period of the orange dwarf  --  7.75 hours  --  is shorter than this , the mass of the dark star must be greater than that of the Sun . By working through the numbers , McClintock and Remillard found that the dark star had to contain at least 3.2 solar masses . This is a lower limit because it assumes we view the binary edge-on . Chances are we do n't . If , instead , the plane of the orange dwarf 's orbit is tilted to our line of sight , then the true velocity of the orange dwarf ( which we can not observe ) is even greater than the line-of-sight velocity ( which we can observe ) . For example , in the extreme case when we observe a binary 's orbit face on , we observe no blueshifts or redshifts at all , since neither star approaches or recedes from us . Now , if the true orbital velocity of the orange dwarf is even greater than what McClintock and Remillard measured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so its orbit must be larger and its separation from the center of mass greater than 0.0136 AU . This greater separation implies a greater mass for the unseen companion , because the orange dwarf now lies farther than we had previously assumed , yet it whips around the dark object so fast that it still completes an orbit every 7.75 hours . McClintock and Remillard 's figure of 3.2 solar masses is a lower limit in another sense as well . Recall that , for a given period , the mass depends on the total separation between the dark companion and the orange dwarf . McClintock and Remillard determined a lower limit only for the separation between the orange dwarf and the center of mass . In order to know the total separation between the dark companion and the orange dwarf , we must also know the distance of the unseen companion from the center of mass . The total separation between the dark companion and the orange dwarf is then the sum of the two . In 1990 , Carole Haswell of the University of Texas at Austin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case or a black hole in A0620-00 by determining the separation of the dark companion from the center of mass . They measured the line-of-sight velocity not only of the K dwarf but also of the dark companion itself . They find the dark companion must be at least 3.8 times more massive than the Sun . Of course , Haswell and Shafter could not observe the black hole directly . Instead , they measured the line-of-sight velocity of the radiation coming from the black hole 's accretion disk . As expected , they found that the black hole completes a revolution around the center of mass every 7.75 hours . Furthermore , the accretion disk 's line-of-sight velocity is exactly out of phase with the orange dwarf 's line-of-sight velocity , as it should be : When the orange dwarf approaches us , the accretion disk recedes from us ; when the orange dwarf recedes from us , the accretion disk approaches . Haswell and Shafter found that the accretion disk  --  and thus the black hole  --  attains a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 43 kms per second . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per second ) is about 11 times greater than this , the black hole must be 11 times more massive than the orange dwarf . Furthermore , the black hole 's distance from the center of mass must be 1/11 the distance of the orange dwarf from the center of mass . Since the orange dwarf lies at least 0.0136 AU from the center of mass , the black hole must lie at least 0.0013 AU from the same center of mass . The total separation between the black hole and the orange dwarf is the sum of these two numbers and , therefore , is at least 0.0149 AU . Together with the period of 7.75 hours , the total separation implies that the black hole 's mass is at least 3.8 times the Sun 's . As before , we get this minimum value of 3.8 solar masses by assuming that we view the binary edge-on . We probably do not view the system edge-on , in which case the true velocities are greater than the velocities we measure , and the separations of each object from the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass for the black hole . What is the most likely mass for the black hole ? A normal K5 dwarf has about 0.7 solar masses . Since the black hole is nearly 11 times more massive than the orange dwarf , the black hole probably has a mass around seven or eight times the Sun 's . This estimate depends on our assuming that the K star is a normal orange dwarf and so could be wrong . Though a well-understood type of star , normal orange dwarfs do not circle black holes , nor are they shaped like eggs the way the K star in A0620-00 is . Nevertheless , from the dynamics of the binary system alone , astronomers conclude that the dark object has at least 3.8 solar masses . It is too massive to be a neutron star . It must therefore be a black hole . Despite its more poetic name , Cygnus X-1 can not make such a claim . In fact , from the orbital motion of the O-type star in Cygnus X-1 , all astronomers can say is that the dark companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not much of a constraint . Evidence that the dark star has a large mass comes from other arguments less secure than orbital dynamics . Thus , although the dark star in Cygnus X-1 is probably a black hole , the dynamics of the binary itself do not force us to conclude that it must be . In contrast , the dark star in A0620-00 must exceed three solar masses and must be a black hole . We know this from the best method possible : the dynamics of the binary that contains the dark star . For no other system in the Galaxy is the evidence so strong and the argument so compelling . A0620-00 is by far the best black hole in the entire Galaxy  --  and the firmest evidence astronomers yet have that these exotic and extreme stars really exist .
