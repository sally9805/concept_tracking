and Other Centers of Classical Art Instruction <p> Jacob Collins , who is profiled in this issue ( page 20 ) , established the Water Street Atelier in Brooklyn , New York , so he could offer the kind of classical art training he found lacking in most art schools . The atelier opened in April 1997 after a group of young men and women transformed a raw industrial space into a series of private studios , open work spaces , a sculptured studio , and a library/lounge . The walls were painted a cool gray , the skylights were scraped clean , and studio furniture was built so that students would have private work stations as well as a common area in which to draw and paint hired models . Private studios were also built for two of Collins ' colleagues who took on some of the teaching and administrative work . <p> At the atelier , students first make graphite and charcoal drawings of plaster casts of larger-than-life body parts ( an ear , a hand , or an eye ) and then drawings of complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group working from a live model , the students draw the figure on canvas , paint over the drawing in tones of gray ( a grisaille ) , and then paint in color over the gray values . " The model holds the same pose four hours a day , five days a week for an entire month , " Collins explains . " The students spend the first week making an accurate drawing and the balance of the month working on the grisaille and the color application . The process is difficult and requires discipline , and I remind students that it can take years before they are able to paint the figure well . They ca n't be in a rush . They have to be calm , patient , and dedicated . " <p> Because the rigorous training program requires personal attention from Collins , and because there is a desire to have students at different levels of development helping each other , only one student is accepted into the atelier at a time . " I conduct a thorough interview of the people who inquire about becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would sacrifice everything to be able to paint like the masters , " Collins explains . " : I his is such a cherished moment when artists realize they can dedicate themselves to this kind of painting without concern for fads and fashions . They are n't chasing fame and fortune like other New York artists . They are following their hearts . " <p> While the students at the Water Street Atelier may not yet be art stars , their drawings and paintings have caught the attention of dealers and collectors . Collins has encouraged his galleries and supporters to review the students ' work . I here is also a gallery in New York that specializes in exhibiting student artwork , and that has become a viable outlet for artists involved in the Water Street Atelier . <p> Although Collins no longer teaches in the same space in which he creates his own paintings , he believes that it is important for students to see him working . " In some ways , I believe that it is dishonest not to share my creative process with the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show students my paintings because it 's important for them to learn how I go about creating pictures . I would like to pass on more than technique . " <p> For those interested in applying , a full-time , longterm commitment is required . Contact : TABLE <p> A number of other ateliers and art schools offer similar instruction , although each emphasizes its own aesthetic values , professional standards , methods of instruction , and preference for materials . Those considering this kind of approach should contact the schools for more specific information . TABLE <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Centers of Classical Art Instruction <p> BY M.
