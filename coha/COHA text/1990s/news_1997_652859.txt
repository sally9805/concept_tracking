<p> Change a player or two in an orchestra or on a baseball team , and chances are you still have pretty much the same orchestra or baseball team . But change a player or two in a string quartet , and it may not be entirely clear what you have . <p> " We are a new quartet , so to speak , so we are in the process of learning a new repertory , " Joel Smirnoff , a violinist in the Juilliard String Quartet , said last month during an open rehearsal by the group in its studio at the Juilliard School . <p> In conversation a few weeks later , Mr. Smirnoff spoke of " the process of rebuilding the group , or I should say continuing the group , because it 's not really rebuilding . " <p> " It 's a different group , basically , " Mr. Smirnoff said later in the same conversation . <p> The Juilliard String Quartet was , of course , substantially changed with the recent departure of the fiery and durable Robert Mann , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since 1969 its only original member . Yet it also remains an august 51-year-old ensemble as it reopens the beautifully renovated Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress in Washington , where it has been the quartet in residence since 1962 . There is a private performance this evening ; the first public concert is tomorrow . <p> Mr. Mann retired from the group after a concert in July at the Tanglewood Festival in Lenox , Mass . At the next Juilliard concert , a month later at Tanglewood , Mr. Smirnoff , who had been the second violinist since 1986 , replaced Mr. Mann , and Ronald Copes , formerly the violinist of the Dunsmuir and Los Angeles Piano Quartets , replaced Mr. Smirnoff . <p> This little game of musical chairs , though not without precedent , is just the sort of unconventional response one might expect from the Juilliard Quartet , which has always followed an innovative and independent path . <p> The Tokyo String Quartet , one of the many younger groups that were coached in their early days by the Juilliard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it replaced its departing first violinist , Peter Oundjian , with Mikhail Kopelman , who had been first violinist of the Borodin String Quartet ; Mr. Oundjian had , after all , replaced the group 's original first violinist , Koichiro Harada , in 1981 with great success . <p> As it happens , though , the Tokyo solution has proved initially problematic , given the striking stylistic differences between the Soviet-trained Mr. Kopelman and his American-trained counterparts . Technically , he is still slightly at odds with them in matters like vibrato ; expressively , his warmth has yet to mesh completely with their heat . Progress has been apparent over the last year , but it has come slowly . ( Not surprisingly , after Mr. Kopelman 's immersion in Russian music , the Tokyo plans to play more of Shostakovich 's music ; so does the Juilliard . ) <p> Despite the small scale and cooperative nature of a string quartet , consisting of two violins , viola and cello , the first violinist is generally something of a leader , nowhere more so than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Emerson String Quartet ( another ensemble given an early boost by the Juilliard ) , where the two violinists alternate as first and second , quartet violinists are usually strongly identified with one position or the other , and a shift requires relearning the entire repertory from a different perspective . <p> None of this has been a particular problem for the Juilliard 's Mr. Smirnoff , who has been a lifelong fan of string quartet literature and who in effect knows many first-violin parts from having interacted closely with them in an intense collaboration over the last decade . <p> " The one problem I 've been having in performance is that as the second violinist , you 're so much involved in the crossfire of the group and you 're so much the catalyst , especially in terms of intonation , " Mr. Smirnoff said . " You 're kind of at a vortex in terms of the upper melody and the lower voices . What 's difficult for me is that I 'm used to being attentive to the group . It has taken me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show myself to the audience . " <p> But courting novelty , in approach as well as in repertory , has always been a Juilliard hallmark , and the spirit of the current adventure is part of what links the new Juilliard String Quartet to the old . The group 's style and tradition , which seem by now virtually identical with Mr. Mann 's character , actually originated in the complex chemistry of four strong-willed musical individuals : in addition to Mr. Mann , Robert Koff , the second violinist ; Raphael Hillyer , the violist , and Arthur Winograd , the cellist . Strong wills and musical individuality have remained other hallmarks . <p> Founded by Mr. Mann in conjunction with the composer William Schuman , then president of the Juilliard School , the quartet quickly established a sterling reputation . In 1962 , it was selected to replace the legendary Budapest String Quartet at the Library of Congress . That affiliation has limped a bit since the Coolidge Auditorium closed eight years ago , awaiting renovation as part of a magnificent restoration of the library 's Jefferson Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts resumes tomorrow . <p> Changes in the quartet 's personnel over the decades have mostly occurred at widely spaced intervals , providing overlapping tenures , which have worked to the group 's advantage in maintaining its tradition . Samuel Rhodes , the current violist , joined in 1969 ; Joel Krosnick , the cellist , in 1974 . Telepathy , No , But It 's Mysterious <p> " Three of us have a pretty good handle on what we 've done over the years , " Mr. Smirnoff said . " It 's not a huge jump for us interpretively with a new member . If we had brought somebody else in as first violinist , it would have been a much harder transition , because that person , unless he had been a mind reader , would n't really be able to perceive what the history was in terms of getting to certain interpretive ideas in certain pieces . " <p> But if what transpires at Juilliard Quartet rehearsals now is not exactly mind reading , it may seem no less mysterious to the nonmusician . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever is nonverbal , " Mr. Krosnick said . " We find that we can play to each other and not talk for a long time , just trusting our instincts to be able to explore . " <p> Mr. Copes , the new member , expanded without elucidating much : " There are questions of articulation , questions of tension , questions of overall scope . All the things that we would deal with verbally are things that we allow ourselves not to have to deal with verbally . But because we do n't have to enunciate them , in a way they become a little bit more easily organic , more easily assimilable . " <p> It is evidently inherent in the nonverbal nature of this communication that it is impossible to explain verbally exactly what passes among the players , and the Juilliard declined to have any of its nonpublic rehearsals observed . At a guess , a player injects a new twist as he leads with a phrase and the others either flatter him with imitation or rebuke him with scowls . <p> Something similar ( minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juilliard Quartet concerts , Mr. Krosnick explained with the help of a football analogy . " If somebody called an audible , we 'd be right there , " he said , referring to the means by which a quarterback changes a play at the line of scrimmage . " It has always been that way . We never did that much planning . All the talk and analysis was intended to outline the parameters of our instincts . " <p> And such , evidently , has been Mr. Copes 's experience . " It took several concerts before I had much trust in knowing I could be very different and feeling that my colleagues would follow , " he said . " There 's room for even more than I expected of that sense of just walking out on the stage and risking . " <p> Still , the Juilliard 's democratic style requires a certain amount of talk and negotiation . " Our philosophy when a new person comes is not to say , ' This is the way we do it , ' and he just adapts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' We 've done it like this . What do you think of that ? Is there something unconvincing about it ? What 's your perspective ? ' " <p> Another aspect of the quartet 's philosophy has hardened into a catch phrase that originated with Mr. Mann . " We wanted to play contemporary music as if it was established and there was a tradition about it and we understood it , " Mr. Mann said recently , trying to reconstruct his words to William Schuman in 1946 , " and we wanted to play the old music so it had a value , a meaning for today . " <p> But again , easily said . How exactly is this done ? Some members cited the importance of the fact that the players have always included composers : Mr. Mann and Claus Adam ( the cellist from 1955 to 1974 ) , who both studied with Stefan Wolpe ; Mr. Rhodes , who studied with Roger Sessions , and Mr. Smirnoff , who leans toward writing jazz . Thus , at least one composer 's eye , ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , modern or ancient , to penetrate to the core of the music . <p> Others cited the heavy stress the quartet lays on contemporary music and the inroad that approach gives to the classics . " In music of our time , we have to develop our own grammar and take real re-creative responsibility , " Mr. Krosnick said . The quartet 's repertory strongly embraces both Elliott Carter and Beethoven , for example , he said , and " the two involvements affect each other . " <p> From all of that philosophy stems the distinctive Juilliard style . If it must be reduced to a word , the word is invariably " intensity . " Some of that intensity , what Mr. Krosnick called " intensity of brain , intensity of spirit , " undoubtedly reflects Mr. Mann 's personality and the influence he has had on his colleagues . Perfection Is Not The Main Priority <p> But the remaining members find it also in the very nature of the quest . " The search for the center of the musical composition is intense , " Mr. Smirnoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes even if a performance is not successful , it will be intense . " <p> That intensity has often come at a cost in polish , especially in recent years . " We were n't interested in a machine-tooled perfection , " Mr. Mann said . " What we were really interested in was being a very strong , involved participant in the evolution of music in the 20th century . Not modern music but all music . " <p> Such a role would be assured if only by the group 's teaching . The style of the Juilliard String Quartet now sounds slightly less distinctive than it once did , for the best of reasons : the players have generously spread the wealth of their spirit and experience in their work with young quartets , thus spawning their own competition . <p> Listen to the Tokyo , the Emerson , the St. Lawrence and the Shanghai String Quartets and myriad others , and hear a little Juilliard.
