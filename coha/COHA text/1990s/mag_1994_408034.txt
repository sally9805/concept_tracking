I still have my robin 's - egg - blue grade - one report card  --  it 's in the original manila envelope , a bit frayed now , inscribed in the impeccable handwriting of my grade - one teacher , Miss E. Hawley . On the front of my report card , it says : " REPORT OF PROGRESS : The letter grades have the following meanings : A  --  Very good indeed , B  --  Good , C  --  Fair , D  --  Poor , E  --  Unsatisfactory . " Inside is the list of subjects : Reading , Writing , Music , Language , and Arithmetic , and beside the subjects are two columns for each school term : Bearer 's Marks and Highest Marks Taken . Remarks are on the opposite page and for the first term Miss Hawley wrote : " Christel 's work has been very good , indeed . " So what if she cribbed her comments from the front cover ? And why the comma after " good " ? Never mind . Miss Hawley made me and my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 40 years later , and a friend of mine just got her daughter 's second - term report card . Here are the first two sentences : Jenny is very comfortable in the classroom and has formed positive relationships with the other children . She participates actively in classroom activities and seems to enjoy the challenge of learning . The first two sentences of her first - term report card ran this way : Jenny has adapted well to the classroom setting and is becoming comfortable with her peers . Jenny works well independently and participates in all activities with interest and enthusiasm . Deja vu ? Were Jenny 's parents as happy as mine were when they got this report card ? No . Did they believe they were getting a thorough assessment of Jenny 's activities and progress ? No . Did they feel like the teacher had a copy of that invaluable reference book 1001 Ways Not to Say Too Much of Anything On a Report Card ? Yes ! Did Jenny 's parents jump to the conclusion that Jenny is not getting as good an education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nervous about their daughter 's education . Standards . Curriculum . The usual things that lots of parents are nervous about these days . And that nervousness rises several notches around report - card time . My friend Alice out in British Columbia says that anecdotal report cards never told her anything she did n't already know about her son : " The teacher writes that Sam loves doing math activities and reading non - fiction books . I know that ! He 's my kid , is n't he ? " Other parents feel the same way : that they 're given a description of their child 's activities rather than an assessment based on standards of achievement . Nevertheless , Alice supports  --  in theory , at least  --  the anecdotal report cards used for B.C. primary - level students because she feels they reflect the fact that young children develop at different rates . " You ca n't discourage children by giving them poor marks just because they do n't learn to read in grade one . Some children take until grade two or even three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " loathe and despise " the anecdotal reports . They want letter grades  --  A , B , C , or the equivalent - because grades somehow reassure them that some standards are being applied to their child 's performance and because they want to know how his performance measures up to the other children 's . ( Remember that old Highest Marks Taken column ? ) Alice admits that she and her husband are pretty happy now that their son is in grade four and getting letter grades . Sam is the competitive type and being graded makes him work harder . But report cards are only one small piece of the assessment puzzle . Parents want to know : Do you , my child 's teacher , have a clear picture of how she is doing ? What standards did you apply to come to this judgement ? Is my child working at her grade level ? Is she progressing ? This is the parents ' assessment agenda . Back in the days of my blue report card , assessment was straightforward : when the teacher gave you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get most of the answers right , you got a good mark . But parents know that it 's not that simple anymore . A survey conducted by Today 's Parent in September 1993 shows that , coast - to - coast , parents support a variety of individualized methods of measuring children 's progress . In fact , 48 percent of respondents rated a combination of assessment methods as very important . This is very much in line with what experts in the assessment business are saying - - that the kind of learning happening in schools today is far too complex to be assessed in a simple format , such as multiple - choice tests . To further complicate the issue other players in the education arena - educators themselves , the business community , politicians  --  have their own assessment agendas . And they often have very different ideas  --  as to why assessment should be done , what it should tell us and what should be done with that information  --  than parents do . When a friend recently heard that I was writing this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents , I found , were anxious to talk about the issue of assessment , but equally anxious to remain anonymous . They do n't want to openly criticize their kids ' educators . ) After the first - term report card came out , my friend and his wife met with their son 's grade - two teacher . " So how 's Jamie doing ? " they asked . " He 's doing wonderfully , " the teacher answered with a reassuring smile . " No problems . " They chatted about the classroom program in general , the teacher related a few jolly anecdotes about Jamie 's work and behaviour , and suddenly the allotted 15 minutes were over . " But we have n't seen any of Jamie 's work , " my friend said . The teacher looked surprised . She had nothing to show them . They eventually discovered that the teacher 's assessment of their son 's progress was based purely on her opinion . All class work was done on pieces of paper that eventually found their way into the wastebasket . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress - there was nothing . All we had was her assurance that Jamie was doing well  --  top of the class , in fact , " snarled my friend . " But it was n't enough . What evidence did we have that she really knew what Jamie was doing ? That he was learning ? " What was happening in that classroom was not assessment , not even close . This story did have a happy ending though . This year Jamie 's new teacher had lots of his work to show at report - card time : daily writing journals , math notebooks , stories , projects . " The teacher knew exactly how Jamie was doing , and she could show us . It was right there in front of us , it was concrete . The hard lesson we learned is that the validity of the assessment depends on the quality of the teacher . " A sobering thought . At the first International Conference on Evaluation held in Toronto last November , Richard Stiggins , director of the Assessment Training Institute in Portland , Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. : " How many of you feel that you are the most competent , confident assessors of student achievement that you could possibly be ? " A ripple of laughter extended around the room and no hands went up . Then Stiggins asked : " How many of you feel that your professional development and background has been inadequate to face the challenges of assessment that are upon us ? " Almost every person in the room raised their hands . A bit scary , is n't it ? So what are these " challenges of assessment " that educators feel so insecure about ? The short answer seems to be that the focus of education has changed and assessment practices are still catching up . Knowledge is important , today 's educators say , but we 're not stopping there . We 're interested in skills , values and attitudes . The process of learning is just as important as the product . Now educators are coming up with forms of assessment that tap this kind of learning . They know that traditional measures just wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place in classrooms around the country : Figure not transcribed Enlightened educators are n't just interested in what children know , they want to determine what children can do with what they know . It 's called performance - based assessment . When Terence Parry , an education consultant who works with school boards in southern Ontario , explains performance - based assessment to the uninitiated , he gives the example of a teacher who tests students on their baking ability by having them memorize the recipe for bread . " That 's what we 've been brainwashed to think testing is all about , " he says . " But it 's not . What you want is to see if the kids can bake bread . Before they begin , you discuss with them the criteria for good bread : crisp crust , tasty , even texture , and so on . Then they know that if they bake bread that conforms with these standards , they pass the test . I 'm not saying throw out paper - and - pencil tests , they 're perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , but that 's not all we 're after . " So when you want to see if kids can write a descriptive paragraph or do a science experiment , you teach them what the standards of excellence are , you have them perform the task and then you evaluate them on how well they have mastered it . The Toronto Board of Education 's Benchmarks program is a performance - based assessment tool that works in exactly this way . Portfolios are used in the Toronto Benchmarks program as a tracking and reporting - to - parents tool and they are part of the new assessment practices around the country . Samples of children 's work are collected in a portfolio and shared with their parents . Portfolios have been around for a few years in B.C. and Alice , for one , quite likes them : " The work in Sam 's portfolio helps his teacher and me focus more concretely on his strengths and weaknesses . " Figure not transcribed The idea behind portfolios is that the student 's work is used as the basis for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . The teacher might ask : Why did you choose this story ? What 's good about it ? We 've been talking about interesting ways to begin a mystery story . Which of them did you use in your story ? This sort of discussion gives teachers clear information about whether the child is absorbing what 's being taught in the classroom . Advocates of this method believe that portfolios give the teachers a chance to assess a much wider range of the student 's abilities than any test could . Self - assessment Self - assesment is the kind of thinking that children do when they consider questions like : " Is my work good ? " " Does it accomplish the goals I set for myself ? " It 's an important part of children 's work with their portfolios , and many educators believe that it 's at the heart of the learning process . They also agree that this is something you use as an addition to the assessment arsenal , not as a replacement for teacher evaluation . At the Toronto assessment conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Bristol , gave this example of a self - assessment by a student named Edward , aged nine : I think that I need to concentrate more on my work , and not go around saying and thinking I can do this straight off when i know I cant . I have enjoyed the Art work this term and I think I have done well on it . It was always been my best subject . I never had to mount my work and make my topic books in Mr Ashley 's class . i think I am managing quite well but I often make slipups when i try to go to fast . The writing this term I think has got my brain working more than last . I would like to do some assemblies like plays about what we have been learning about during this term . Now Edward 's spelling may not be brilliant , but as Broadfoot pointed out , he 's got some other skills down  --  he 's assessing his own work , setting goals for himself , and tracking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the department of research and systems development at the Calgary Board of Education , makes a convincing argument forthe importance of self - assessment . " Students " ability to assess their own learning is going to be critical to their success as adults , " she says . " We know that as adults they 're going to have to change jobs at least half a dozen times . They must have some insights into their own learning processes and be constantly assessing themselves and setting new goals for their learning all through their lives . " Figure not transcried Classroom observation has been around a long time as a method of assessing progress , particularly in the primary grades . Parents trust what their children 's teachers see  --  37 percent of the respondents to the Today 's Parent questionnaire rated this method as very important . " A teacher 's day - to - day experience with the child is far more important for assessment purposes than a one - shot test that can go either way depending on the circumstances , " wrote one parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what Damian Cooper , an instructional leader at the Halton ( Ontario ) Board of Education , calls " eyeballing "  --  the practice that so upset my friends , Jamie 's parents . Says Cooper , " Much of the work that I do in observation is to convince teachers of the need to have reliable , accurate data gathered over time before they make evaluative statements about students . " To help teachers do a thorough job , the Halton board and many others are implementing checklists of the skills the children need to acquire through the grade levels . For example , a reading skills checklist for kindergarten might include points like : begins to recognize letters and related sounds , recognizes that illustrations and print have meaning , reads print in the world around him/her . The teacher uses the checklist to track the students ' progress . And shares it with parents . This sharing business is a big change , according to Ken O'Connor , curriculum co - ordinator responsible for student evaluation at the Scarborough ( Ontario ) Board of Education . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share things like this in detail  --  it was almost part of the mystique of education , " he says . " But now we 've recognized that these indicators should be available to parents . Parents need to be aware of them and need to access them  --  when their children have problems and just to get an understanding of what is being taught . " But information - sharing can backfire too  --  if it 's not relevant or not couched in language that 's " parent - friendly . " A Nova Scotia mother I spoke to described herself as overwhelmed by the pages and pages of " skills lists " that were laid out in her child 's report card . It was " educationese " overload  --  that , ironically , still left her wondering whether her son was covering the basic curriculum . She went to her local school board and got a copy of the curriculum to cross - reference with the report - card lists . ( Are parents a suspicious lot ? No , not really , we just want clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to good old testing ? Well , many teachers still use tests and quizzes as part of their classroom assessment . And large - scale standardized testing  --  across school boards , provinces and nationwide  --  is definitely on the rise . Testing by school boards to find out how well their schools are delivering the program . Testing to compare the levels of competency of children across the country . To help develop the curriculum . To assess individual student achievement . But one ca n't help feel that the biggie is , as Ontario Minister of Education and Training Dave Cooke put it : " to rebuild public confidence in our education system . " Accountability . They 're telling us nervous parents : " Relax , folks , we 're on the job . Look , we 're even testing your kids . The situation is under control . " What is interesting is that the kinds of tests being given are changing . Because so many educators have serious reservations about the multiple - choice test format , hybrids are being pioneered  --  like the School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council of Ministers of Education ) , which includes performance - based assessment . Pat Crawford , chief research and evaluation officer at the North York ( Ontario ) Board of Education , explains her board 's decision to get into largescale language and math testing this way : " Parents had indicated to us that they wanted something more systematic than they were getting in the past , and I think it 's important to respond to what your clients are telling you . " According to Veronica Lacey , the board 's director of education , the intent of the tests is no surprises . " We want to get a portrait of how our youngsters are doing and ensure that we know as quickly as possible if there is a problem . Our whole philosophy of testing is that we want to see improvement . " Language testing is done in grades three , five and seven and math testing in grades four , six and eight . Students are tested in September and again near the end of the school year  --  to see where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . North York principal Sandie Brauti likes the testing . " It helps us focus our teaching where the kids need it most , " she says . Sounds like a good idea  --  testing to improve teaching . I was assured that the results of the testing are available to the parents , although all three educators did express worries about parents getting hung up on the numbers . ( But we ca n't help it , that 's the way we were raised ! And what if parents use the numbers to compare schools and start shopping around ? An educator 's nightmare ! ) A North York parent I spoke to had a different story to tell . She has two children in two different North York schools , goes to the PTA and works as a parent volunteer  --  in other words a concerned , involved parent . She says the board is not communicating effectively with parents about the testing . Parents generally do n't know what the tests are all about and , most importantly , they do n't even know that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty confusing : the board says they 're testing because parents want it , but they are n't giving the parents the results of the test  --  unless the parents know enough to ask and many of them do n't . The bottom line for parents is : How is my child doing ? So how do we get the answer ? By talking to our child 's teacher and making sure that standards are being applied in the classroom and that assessment tools are being used . There 's no magic formula , no simple right and wrong . Different things work for different teachers  --  and for different children . There are lots of ways to handle the important job of assessment , each with its own pros and cons . But the main thing is that it happens  --  comprehensive assessment and clear reporting . This brings me back full circle to my first - grade report card . Miss Hawley taught me well and she assessed me and she told my parents how I was doing . But Miss Hawley had it easy back then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed dramatically . And , to give the educational community its due , many innovative changes have already been adopted to meet a complex and evolving set of demands . What educators now need to do is find a way to communicate those changes to parents , in language we can understand . <p>
