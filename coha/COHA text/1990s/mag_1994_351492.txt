Ezra Taft Benson had not appeared in public for two years . Toward the end , he could not leave his apartment and had to be fed by nasal tube . Yet he remained " Prophet , Seer and Revelator , " the supreme authority of the Mormon Church until his death last week at the age of 94 . A group of dark-suited apostles called the Council of the Twelve will gather this week in the central Temple in Salt Lake City , Utah , to " set apart " a new prophet from among themselves . If tradition is a guide , they will select the chief of the council as Benson 's successor and the Mormon Church 's 14th president  --  in this case Howard Hunter . At 86 , Hunter , who had open-heart surgery eight years ago and a gall- bladder operation last year , will be the first head of the Mormon Church born in the 20th century . <P> In spite of this gerontocracy , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints remains vibrant . Its sedulous missionary work has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful both at home and overseas . The church has nearly 9 million members , up from 5.6 million in 1984 .

Its current challenges : feminism and historical revisionism that pound away at the faith . <P> That faith is an exotic mixture of innovative Americana and unconventional Christianity . Indeed , while Mormon teachers speak increasingly of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual theology . Mormon history states that Joseph Smith founded the church in Fayette , New York , in 1830 after being directed by the angel Moroni to unearth a set of inscribed golden plates . These provided him with revelations that ancient Hebrews migrated to North America around 600 B.C. Later Jesus Christ , after his ministry in the Middle East , came to preach to these lost tribes of Israel in America . The tribes eventually split into warring factions , the Nephites and Lamanites , the latter being the ancestors of the American Indians . <P> Smith , who was assassinated in 1844 in Carthage , Illinois , taught that the trinity is not a triune God as Christians believe but rather " three gods . " Meanwhile , God the Father was once a man who achieved divinity . As church prophet Lorenzo Snow , who died in 1901 , put it , " As man is , God once was ; as God is , man may become .
