Just after sunrise , Colorado 's Arapahoe Basin Ski Area is quiet . A smooth , white blanket of new snow covers wide runs and hangs from the trees . Suddenly a voice calls out , " Fire in the hole ! " and a thunderous BOOM shatters the silence . Within seconds , snow on a nearby hillside begins to tumble down . It coasts to a stop , and everything becomes still again . " I hear the blasting all the time when I ski , but I never thought much about it , " says Michael Bombace , a 14-year-old Life Scout with Troop 199 in Denver , Colo . Last April Michael , along with fellow Troop 199 Life Scout Trevor Payne and Justin Henceroth , an 11year-old Tenderfoot Scout with Troop 186 in Dillon , Colo. , had the chance to learn about avalanche control from " A-Basin 's " experts . Small Slides Save Lives No one wants to get caught in an avalanche . So ski areas , high ; say departments , mining companies and others work to reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By setting off smaller slides , controllers keep snow from piling up and then crashing down with destructive force . The Scouts learned avalanche control is more than tossing bombs . The work combines planning , knowledge of explosives , years of experience and attention to the smallest details . " Avalanche-control crews trigger avalanches on purpose , before people can trigger them by accident , " explains Leif Eric Borgeson , an Arapahoe Basin ski patroller . An Inexact Science Much of the control comes after snowstorms , when the probability of an avalanche is highest . Work starts early . Before dawn a member of the Arapahoe Basin crew has checked overnight weather conditions . A varied mix of snowfall , wind , temperature and humidity conditions helps patrollers determine if they face a " control day . " If they do , teams have only two hours to make the mountain safe before the ski lifts open . // <p>
