<p> Voluntary environmental cleanup program is working <p> As the lead agency responsible for state implementation of the federal Superfund program in Colorado , we offer three observations on the June 25 article regarding the cleanup program . <p> First , as the completion chart indicates , a significant amount of cleanup has already been accomplished in Colorado . With the exception of some of the federally owned sites , which are the most complex , Superfund cleanups should be virtually completed at Colorado sites in the next three to five years . Most of the immediate threats to public health and the environment have been addressed in the work that has been completed to date or is currently under way . <p> Second , much of the cleanup progress can be directly linked to the retroactive-liability provision of the Superfund law . Although there may be some unfairness for companies having to clean up pollution from activities that were arguably legal at the time , the retroactive-liability provision of Superfund is based on the simple principle that " the polluter pays " for the costs of cleanup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Superfund and the polluter no longer has to pay for cleanup costs , who will ? The alternative of having taxpayers pay for cleanups appears to be even more unfair and is unlikely in the current fiscal climate in Washington . <p> There are ways to make retroactive liability fairer , to reduce the transaction costs associated with establishing liability and improve the efficiency of the programs . The law should be amended to do so . <p> Finally , there are hundreds of additional contamination sites in Colorado that will not qualify for the federal Superfund program , but which still warrant cleanup . The state is also working to achieve cleanup at many of these sites in a more cooperative and expedited fashion through its new voluntary cleanup program . <p> The new program provides for owners of contaminated property to propose cleanups voluntarily and have the plan reviewed and approved by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment within 45 days . Fifteen of these plans have been received in the first year of this program . We hope many more cleanups will be accomplished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Director <p> Office of Environment <p> HOWARD A. ROITMAN , Director <p> Hazardous Materials <p> and Waste Management Division <p> State of Colorado , Denver <p> Keep telephone competition fair and open <p> The U.S. Congress currently is debating telecommunications legislation that will have a significant impact on Colorado 's business and residential customers . <p> In June , the U.S. Senate passed landmark legislation that opens communication markets to competition - local telephone , long distance and cable television . Attention now turns to the House , where members are considering a bill , HR 1555 , that is far more regulatory and restrictive . <p> This debate is particularly important in Colorado because of a state law passed earlier this year that opens the local telecommunications market to competition . Beginning in July 1996 , any number of companies will be free to compete with U S West to provide local telephone service . For Colorado customers , the most important goal at the state and federal levels is to ensure that competition is fair and robust . The Colorado law includes a process to establish rules for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and it would be unfortunate if poorly written federal legislation derailed that effort . <p> U S West supports full competition - opening up all markets to all providers for all services . Unfortunately , HR 1555 does not accomplish this . Instead , HR 1555 limits the local phone companies , like U S West , from competing in the marketplace . It keeps us out of the long-distance market , contrary to the bill passed by the U.S. Senate . By subjecting us to artificial constraints that our competitors do n't face , we will be unable to offer to our customers the same products and services that our competitors will offer . <p> If AT &T; and other long-distance carriers can use their financial and marketing muscle to compete in the local phone market , U S West should be able to compete - on equal terms and conditions - in the long-distance market . Unfortunately , HR 1555 falls seriously short of creating the fair and open competition true reform demands . Consumers should have the right to select telecommunications services from the wide assortment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would impede delivery of service to our customers . <p> HR 1555 must be amended in order to bring the promise of fair and open competition in Colorado . <p> JOHN SCULLY <p> U S West Communications <p> Colorado Vice President <p> Denver <p> Working citizens can vote if they wish <p> Robert D. McPhee is totally off base in his complaint that " It 's tough to work and vote on the same day " ( Post , July 5 ) . Section 1-7-102 of the election code ( Employees entitled to vote ) reads as follows : <p> " ( 1 ) Eligible electors entitled to vote at an election shall be entitled to absent themselves for the purpose of voting from any service or employment in which they are then engaged or employed on the day of the election for a period of two hours during the time the polls are open . Any such absence shall not be sufficient reason for the discharge of any person from service or employment . Eligible electors , who so absent themselves shall not be liable for any penalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wages , on account of their absence . Eligible electors who are employed and paid by the hour shall receive their regular hourly wage for the period of their absence , not to exceed two hours . Application shall be made for the leave of absence prior to the day of election . The employer may specify the hours during which the employee may be absent , but the hours shall be at the beginning or end of the work shift , if the employee so requests . <p> " ( 2 ) This section shall not apply to any person whose hours of employment on the day of the election are such that there are three or more hours between the time of opening and the time of closing of the polls during which the elector is not required to be on the job . " Also , with early and absentee voting , the opportunity is there if you want it . <p> DAVID AITKEN <p> Denver <p> Post 's news priorities seem distorted <p> It 's a shame when The Post chooses to slap on its front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example is the four-column , top-of-the-page " news " story about a Denver judge who is boycotting his 20th Arapahoe High School reunion because host Cherry Hills Country Club allegedly discriminates against women , while peace talk updates in Jerusalem and the FDA endorsement of a promising heart disease medication get pushed to page two . Apparently , The Post feels that the politically correct action of one judge toward one country club concerning one silly high school reunion is more newsworthy than peace talks and heart drugs that affect the lives of millions . <p> DAVID ROSENTHAL <p> Littleton <p> Freedom : the privilege <p> of doing what 's right <p> Did anyone else notice the latest example of our country 's double standard regarding the unborn ? <p> In the July 4 Denver Post there was an article headlined , " Mom can sue over tot 's death . " This article relates how Paula Keefe and her husband can sue Pizza Hut because the child she was carrying was born 13 weeks early , then died as a result of complications from the early birth . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongful death and therefore her parents could sue Pizza Hut . If Shanae , at 23 weeks gestation , is protected from wrongful death , they why is it that a woman can have a third-trimester abortion performed ? <p> Shanae was wanted . She was born 23 weeks from conception . Because of complications she died . The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Shanae had the same inalienable rights as we life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . <p> WILLIAM D. BLANCKE <p> Englewood <p> Even as a person schemes to rid himself of the source of his frustration and plots to do so by taking another 's life , so is abortion . <p> Perhaps abortion is even more felonious in that the victim of the death wish is totally unaware , helpless and above all innocent . <p> We are killing the very ones we should be seeking to emulate : the pure and innocent . I fear for a society that is so callous , heartless and debonair about the death of the innocent . <p> Freedom is not the right to do whatever one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obligation , to do what is right . <p> KARL SCHMELING <p> Englewood <p> Arrogance at Commerce <p> Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 's entourage to the trade summit was 81 people . And he has the audacity to proclaim that the taxpayer gets more bang for the buck from the Department of Commerce than any other federal agency ? That , coupled with their arrogance , as documented by Jim Carrier 's column of July 3 , leads me to the conclusion that we do n't need this agency . <p> BRAD POWELL <p> Golden
