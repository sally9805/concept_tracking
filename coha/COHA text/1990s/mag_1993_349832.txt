The biggest lie in America , other than " The check is in the mail , " is " I 'm from the government , and I 'm here to help you . " <P> The Pentagon calls its new weapon the Civil Servant . Reason : it wo n't work and ca n't be fired . <P> Did you hear the one about the clerk who needed a full week to fill out all the papers to comply with the requirements of the government 's latest initiative , the Paperwork Reduction Act ? <P> Jokes about the inefficiencies and convolutions of government bureaucracy are as American as , well , a crust-enclosed dessert filled with the fruit of deciduous Eurasian plants known as apple trees . The first two are gags that were probably old when Vice President Al Gore 's father Albert Sr. was first elected to the Senate in 1952 . Their antiquity indicates how deeply entrenched are the habits of bureaucratic bumbling , and the immense force of inertia that sustains them . The paperwork story was presented as fact by a Treasury Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings the Vice President has been holding with federal employees . It points to the failure of previous attempts to carry out the job President Clinton has given Gore : streamlining the bloated federal bureaucracy , loosening the straitjacket of its rigid rules and making it less maddening for citizens to deal with . <P> Nonetheless , Gore 's task force this week will release a report , formally labeled the National Performance Review , that aims at nothing less than " reinventing government "  --  the title of a best-selling 1992 book that the Vice President has adopted as his slogan . Gore 's report will recommend sweeping changes in the way the federal bureaucracy draws up its budgets , organizes its departments and agencies , buys its equipment and supplies , even in its procedures for hiring , promoting and ( gasp ! ) firing employees . <P> Then what ? Well . . . not all that much , if one is to judge from the precedents set by the two Hoover commissions under Truman and Eisenhower , Jimmy Carter 's zero-based budgeting plan , and the Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these efforts did produce worthwhile reforms . But all were frustrated by the realities of the Washington power game . The savvy and iron-bottomed persistence of bureaucrats in protecting their turf is nothing short of awe inspiring . So is the jealousy with which Congress guards its power to spell out for government agencies , in the most niggling detail , what they may and may not do . <P> The White House , however , is at least giving Gore 's report a splashier send- off than any of the previous overhaul efforts . Following Gore 's press conference on Tuesday , Bill Clinton himself will hit the road to whoop up Gore 's plans , with likely stops in Cleveland , Ohio , and Houston . The Administration plans some kind of publicity event on five of the six days after the conference , each probably featuring a horror story of inefficiency . Gore has compiled an extensive list , headed by the 10 pages of specifications for ashtrays  --  or , as they are known to the government , " ash receivers , tobacco ( desk type ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
