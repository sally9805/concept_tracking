##@x <p> In just a year , the Democrats will head home from a hard week in Madison Square Garden settling on their candidate for President and their priorities and platform . But now , with only a year to go , they have no plausible challenger to President Bush . They have little in the way of common priorities or program , little even perhaps by way of a party . <p> That 's not a problem merely for the Democrats , intimidated by Mr. Bush 's virtuosity in foreign affairs and harsh wedge politics at home . The lack of coherent opposition also constitutes a problem for the public . With Congressional Democrats working so often in coalition , not opposition , what 's sorely missing is the adversarial debate that a campaign promises , the debate needed to force the right choices for the right problems . <p> With that in mind , we offer ourselves as interim pinch-hitters . Not as partisans for the Democrats , nor the Republicans , but for frustrated Americans eager to tame the future . <p> America has focused responsibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the cold war . Yet that opens the way for change at home , too  --  not that you 'd know it from the Democrats . They deride the President 's inability to describe , let alone provide what he calls " the vision thing . " But where 's the peace dividend ? What 's their domestic policy ? <p> That 's why we set out in this series of editorials , to appear occasionally in coming weeks , to identify and then appraise several themes that underlie the next election and the future and yet are obscured or ignored by the political process . <p> The Political Process Itself . To many Americans , politics has become remote and sterile , posing false choices . For all the angry abortion debate , as an example , most Americans could probably agree in two minutes on a six-word policy : Discourage abortions but do n't ban them . Yet in the political arena , the extremist fury drags on for still more years , oblivious to urgent concerns like the blazing spread of measles . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathews cites reaction " against a political system that is perceived as so autonomous that the public is no longer able to control and direct it . People talk as though our political system had been taken over by alien beings . " <p> Investment in the Future . The surest way Americans can take control of the future is to invest in ourselves . Americans who recognize that future prosperity depends on technological advance will recognize the need to spend for education , job training and infrastructure . <p> But what employment debate , meanwhile , preoccupies Washington ? It concerns , infuriatingly and irrelevantly , supposed minority quotas . <p> Family Issues  --  and Problems . In his new book , " Why Americans Hate Politics , " E. J. Dionne Jr . writes : " We give the game away when we talk about ' issues , ' not ' problems . ' Problems are solved ; issues are merely what politicians use to divide the citizenry and advance themselves . " <p> Listen to a working mother in Los Angeles . What " issues " cross her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Not enough water . Lead in the water . Measles . Food safety . Microwave emissions . The cost of day care . Teachers ' morale in the school down the street . So tell me , which politicians are talking to me ? " <p> Race and Poverty . A generation after the civil rights revolution , this bittersweet oversimplification is possible : Black Americans with jobs are making it ; those without jobs are not . Two-parent families , especially in the West , are nearing income parity with whites . Ghettos , meanwhile , house the people left behind , beset by an ever-harsher distillation of crime , drugs and disease . <p> Harsh , but not hopeless . Experience shows that help can help , particularly early intervention with young mothers . Even so , the false face accepted in current politics is that to help poor minorities is to pour more money down a rathole . <p> Buying  --  and Getting  --  Health Care . U.S. medicine is magnificent , at the frontiers of progress , and yet America also pays more for less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any scale of need , the Administration still dithers and Congress is just waking up . <p> Yet there is an intelligent , affordable reform , one that could quickly save lives and billions . It will be described tomorrow in the next editorial of this series , which proceeds from the conviction that what Americans want , with or without the constructive pressure of a campaign , is real politics , real priorities and real choices . @@649968 Susanna Ashford , Bayberry Run Plantation <br> Greene County , Tennessee <br> To <br> Mrs. Cora Poole , Blossom Street <br> Boston , Massachusetts <br> Thursday , April 25 , 1861 <br> Dear Mrs. Poole , <br> Please , I beg you , tell no one what you saw . <br> You said it was nothing , and I pray that 's the truth . I wish there had been time to speak to you before you got on the train . I will always be so grateful to you for helping me as you did , and did not dare imperil your situation by even a day 's delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've heard the stories . <br> I 'm afraid  --  crossed out . <br> Please forget . <br> I enclose this in a package of the books Emory 's father says he is sending you . I hope that it reaches you in safety and that you enjoy the books . I am killed with envy that you 're getting his copy of The Hunchback of Notre Dame ! <br> You are the only person here  --  the only person I 've ever met , really  --  who has truly and disinterestedly acted as my friend . I do n't want what happened to destroy that . Please tell me it 's really all right . <br> Your friend , <br> Susanna Ashford <br> P.S. Enclosed is a sketch of us going to Nashville . <br> Mrs. Cora Poole , Blossom Street <br> Boston , Massachusetts <br> To <br> Miss Susanna Ashford , Bayberry Run Plantation <br> Greene County , Tennessee <br> Monday , May 6 , 1861 <br> Dear Susanna , <br> Did we not agree , when I escorted you down to Nashville in March that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am concerned , that has not changed . Indeed , after eight whole weeks of matrimony I still find the thought of being Mrs. Anything unsettling . Our Lord said , " Let your Yea be Yea , and your Nay be Nay , " and when I told you , " It 's nothing , " I meant it . I may be a " mealymouthed Abolitionist bluestocking , " as your Aunt Sally so tactfully put it at that frightful - tea  --  party , but having grown up in an atmosphere poisoned by gossip , I have no wish to either spread it , or credit it . Be reassured , I will keep the thing I saw to myself . Yet I can not pretend that I am not profoundly disturbed by it , and more than a little concerned for your safety . <br> Your letter arrived Saturday . The books that accompanied it were consigned to the attic , for I do not read novels . <br> When I wrote my letters of thanks to my kind hostess for the - tea  --  party , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Johnson and your sister-in-law offered warm Southern hospitality , but in you I sensed actual friendship . Thank you for it , from the bottom of my heart . To excuse my delay in responding I plead the exigencies of setting up housekeeping for the first time : sewing curtains , learning which farmers in the market can be trusted not to water their milk , setting up - account  --  books with grocer , butcher , and the man who delivers the coal , and finding a - servant  --  girl who is honest . Back on Deer Isle , everyone knows the girls who " help " and can complain of them to their mothers if they misbehave . Here , most prospective " helpers " are immigrant Irish or German girls , and their mothers speak little or no English . <br> I trust our efforts in Nashville have borne fruit , and your admission to the Academy is secured ? I know you were apprehensive . Yet I can not see how your father would object to your hope of attending the Academy , much less of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's son , rather than a daughter , there would be no question of keeping you from the technical training that shapes ability into excellence . One look at your sketchbook convinced me how extraordinary your talent is . <br> Forgive me if I write too warmly . My own father took great care , and suffered no small amount of criticism , that I should have an education equal to my brother 's , and it is a matter very close to my heart . Please let me know , as soon as you hear . <br> And thank you , for your concern not to delay our departure . Happily , our train was not stopped by the militia bands one hears of . I trust that all remains quiet in your section ? <br> Please extend my best wishes to Mrs. Johnson when next you see her , and thank her again for her hospitality . <br> Ever your friend , <br> Cora Poole <br> N.B. April 12-14 , 1861 , Fort Sumter was shelled by Confederates and taken . <br> Susanna Ashford , Bayberry Run Plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poole , Blossom Street <br> Boston , Massachussets <br> Monday , May 20 , 1861 <br> Dear Cora , <br> Thank you , thank you , thank you ! I still do n't know what to do  --  or even what to think  --  about what happened at the depot . <br> I ca n't let  --  crossed out <br> I bless you for your silence . <br> There have been housekeeping exigencies here , too , largely having to do with getting the tobacco seedlings transplanted . We have three hundred acres in tobacco , and about half again as much in corn , and my oldest brother , who oversees the day-to-day work of our plantation , leaves tomorrow to join the Army . <br> And thank you , more than I can say , for your words about going to the Academy . It 's so true : were I a boy there would be no question whether I should go to the art academy in Philadelphia , even if it is in Enemy Territory now . There certainly was n't any about my brother Payne going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here since my Evil Stepmother died when I was nine  --  Pa likes the way I manage the servants , and do the accounts . When Julia was getting ready for her wedding , and did n't need me for a companion anymore , she was happy to tell Pa how nice it would be for me to go to the Academy . But now that Tom has gone into the Army , and Julia is home again , she does n't want me to leave , either . When Pa shakes his head and sighs , " Now , Babygirl , there is n't a thing they teach at that Academy that you ca n't learn right here at home , " I sneak up to my room and read and - re  --  read your letter , to remind myself that he says so only because I 'm a girl . That I have as much of a right to be an artist , as a boy would . <br> Friday , May 24 <br> I ca n't imagine not reading novels . When I was little , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holler to go hunting with Emory , and I 'd sit on the - dog  --  trot and read Mr. Poole 's books . Some of them I could n't understand ( a lot were in Latin and French and Greek ) , but sometimes Mr. Poole would come out of the woods and help me with them . Then at night I 'd tell the stories back to Julia and Payne , or make up other stories about the characters . Even though I know you do n't read them , I 'm glad to know Mr. Poole 's books are safe in your attic . The Secesh militia has been burning the houses of Unionists . <br> Did n't you even read Uncle Tom 's Cabin ? <br> Your friend , <br> Susanna <br> P.S. I enclose a sketch of your train being attacked by the Secesh militia . That 's Julia down in the lower corner , fainting into President Lincoln 's arms . ( Does he still have a beard ? ) <br> Mrs. Cora Poole , Blossom Street <br> Boston , Massachusetts <br> To <br> Miss Susanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Monday , June 3 , 1861 <br> Dear Susanna , <br> Had I known  --  as I now do , thanks to your sketch  --  that Confederate militia bands include elephant corps , chariots , and archers firing from balloons , I would certainly have been even more apprehensive than I was at the thought of them attacking our - home  --  bound train . I will treasure your sketch , and take it to show the ladies of my Tuesday night Soldiers ' Aid Society . What on earth is a " - dog  --  trot " ? <br> " . . . there is n't a thing they teach at that Academy "  --  fiddlesticks ! I heard that from every one of our neighbors when I was preparing to go to the Female Seminary on the mainland : " What 's wrong with the schools right here on Deer Isle ? " Your father doubtless thinks there are plenty of - drawing  --  teachers in Greene County , as good as anything you 'd find in Philadelphia , or Paris for that matter ! <br> Of course I except Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written as it was with a higher purpose than mere frivolity . Even my father excepted it , once I had lent my copy to him . This was after my - school  --  friend Elinor thrust it upon me and declared she would never speak to me again , until I read it . And please forgive me my assumption that you would follow your family 's lead on the question of Secession  --  an assumption unworthy of Mrs. Wollstonecraft , and Lucretia Mott , and other champions of the right of women to think and speak after the promptings of their own hearts . Or do I mistake your words ? I am extremely curious to know what you thought of the book ? I wept and wept over it . <br> Tuesday , June 25 <br> An interruption . Only days after the receipt of your letter , my mother wrote me from Deer Isle that my brother Oliver quite astonishingly announced his intention to wed , and Emory and I took the train back to Maine to attend the wedding . ( Mother is fit to be tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom I grew up , though my darling bossy Elinor could not attend , being great with her second child . Most of the men were out with the - cod  --  fleet , and all my aunts and cousins and - second  --  cousins deep engaged in the cultivation of their gardens . <br> The talk was of nothing but the War , and of the parade when the first of the Maine regiments marched south ; of how we will " make the Southerners pay for their audacity . " Flags float from every public edifice and most private ones as well . Despite the joy of having milk and butter from our own cows , and good country vegetables  --  despite the beauty of the wildflowers in our woods and the pleasure of working in Mother 's garden again  --  I was conscious as never before of how primitive is the life on our island , and how narrow the focus of its dwellers , though they be people that I love . Nowhere did I hear even the suggestion that all Southerners might not be degenerate - slave  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . I sorely missed the variety of its newspapers , and the chance to read more than one view of a subject : here in Boston I read not only our own Transcript and Harper 's but several New York papers as well . Sorely , too , I missed the opportunity to hear lectures other than the Sunday sermon at church , or music beyond the level of the choir singing a hymn . How far I have come from that world ! <br> We travelled up with my older brother Brock , his wife , and their children . Army recruiters were active on the island ; fifteen of our men have enlisted , including four of my cousins , our hired man , Elinor 's husband Nathan , and my friend Deborah 's fiance Charles . Most of those who signed up for the - three  --  month enlistment were married men , many with children . <br> I send this in care of Eliza Johnson , who writes me that though postal service between the States of the Confederacy , and those of the Union , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
