When he left the CIA many years ago , Robin Wilson underwent a long procedure that allowed him to make public the information that he had once worked in intelligence . He still ca n't own up to any inspiration he might have provided for Tommy Lee Jones 's character in Men in Black , so do n't even ask . However , in his anthologies Those Who Can and Paragons he has confessed to his role in founding the Clarion workshops some thirty years ago , so we know him to be capable of perpetrating devious acts with long-reaching effects . This new story finds him dealing again with subtle criminal machinations . We 've hastened to bring it to you before it ceases to qualify as speculative fiction . <p> THE WORST THING ABOUT the robbery , the biggest one in our little town 's history , was that it came when I was just a couple of weeks on the new job , when I knew everyone was still wondering , can the black guy hack it ? But it was n't just me who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charters do n't stay local , and this got everyone in the department uptight , eager to get it cleared fast , or at least handed off with real clean site work to the Feds . The best thing was that nobody got hurt , although Mrs. Symonds , who 's the head teller at the Modoc County Federal Savings 8t Loan on Elvis Street , said she was sure it had cost her a couple of years off her life . " Scared the livin " shit outta me , " she said and then covered her mouth with embarrassment and gave a sidelong glance over my shoulder at where Tani Jefferson , standing just outside the yellow crime scene tape stretched across the tellers " counter , was covering the story for Channel 12 . " Oops , " said Mrs. Symonds . " Better watch my tongue , the media here and all . " We were in the corner of the bank where people wait to talk to one of the bank officers , get a car loan , straighten out some payment hassle . Mrs. Symonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fanning herself . I stood in front of her , bending my six and a half feet over so as not to loom too much , which the Chief had warned me about when I shucked the blue and became the department 's sole detective . " Looking like a Lakers guard is great , Linc , " he had said . " That is , when you 're in uniform , breaking up a Saturday night fight over at the Wet Spot . But working in civvies , questioning people , eliciting information - you got ta be a little less- ah - imposing . " month . Outside in the warm April sunshine , two uniforms - the entire day watch in our little town-were canvassing the merchants up and down the street . A guy from County Criminalistics was dusting around the tellers " stations and over around the front of the vault , although what he thought he 'd find was a mystery to me . " Do n't worry about the reporter , Mrs. Symonds , " I said , making a mark in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her answers . " Just tell me what happened . How many of them were there ? " " There was two of them , detective , " she said . " Is " detective " right ? Or should it be officer ? " " ' Detective " is fine . Or Mundy . Or jeeze , Mrs. Symonds , you 've known me since I was a little kid . How about Linc ? " When I was old enough to be aware of adults outside my own household , and they of me , I 'm sure Mrs. Symonds had known me as that little colored kid down the street . In our part of northern California , Negro and colored did n't become " black " until I was a school kid , back in the late " 70s . Now , four months into the new century , African-American still had n't made the local lingo , which was okay with me . " There was two of " em , " said Mrs. Symonds again . " The one guy , he came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of black thing with a big curved whatchamacallit sticking out of the bottom ... " " Magazine , " I said . " Yeah . Whatever . He 's the one scared the-uh-you know outta me . Scared Milli pretty good too , both of us layin " on the floor in front of the counter with our eyes closed like he told us . Milli cried some , she was so scared . " " Okay , then what happened . " " Well , I peeked . I could see the other one , the one out in that blue van that was across the street ? Headed toward Kenton ? It had those smoky windows but I could still see this man kinds bent over on the driver 's side , calm as you please , just gunnin " the motor a little . Vroom ! Vroom ! Over and over again , regular as clockwork . " " And ? " I had learned patience after nearly eight years in harness , but Mrs. Symonds was pushing the envelope on it . Which was amusing Tam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a crooked grin , a raised eyebrow on a face as brown and beautiful as my craziest teenage dream . " And , " said Mrs. Symonds , " the fellow inside musta known we got the armored truck delivery that time on most Thursdays , " cause he knew just where the bags were in front of the vault , waitin " for us to inventory , put " em away . Musta known that was the morning Mr. Cleary would be at that Kiwanis thing . Musta known that was the morning Mr. Hapwell had to take his kid to the orthodontist , which is costing him a bundle , let me tell you , and on his salary ... " " And ? " My impatience showed this time . " Come on , Mrs. Symonds , what happened . " " Well , I 'm tryin " to tell you . This little guy could hardly carry two of them bags at a time , which believe you me they are very heavy . Took him three trips out the front door to that van , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nobody paid him any attention . Three trips with me and Milli scared to death on the floor , and then they was gone . " " Can you estimate the take ? " " Got the receipt here from Loomis . It was all bills , our big makeup after the first of the month check cashing , the plant bein " on three shifts and all . Boy , we been busy last couple of days . Not like it used to be before everybody went to using plastic , but still ... " " How much does it say , " I said , reaching for the receipt . " It was a bunch , " Mrs. Symonds said , hanging on to the receipt . " $993,320 to be exact , mostly in twenties and hundreds . That 's what people want nowadays . " Of course , mostly all we did was the crime scene stuff , and the Feds moved right in . And to give the arrogant bastards credit , it only took them about a week to break it , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture on the bank 's surveillance camera which we circulated around the area , got a hit from a woman in personnel out at the plant who recognized one Edward Ellsworth Gaffney from when he had worked as some kind of computer geek in payroll out there . So the Feds put out a wanted on the NCIC , and some smart beat cop turned up Gaffney where he 'd gone to ground in San Francisco . No sign of the million bucks , however . " One down , one to go , " I said to the Chief the morning I got back from Treasure Island , where I 'd taken delivery of Gaffney from the SFPD . We would hold him for a local lineup and then ship him off to the county slammer to await trial . I was feeling kind of good , even though it had been the bank 's camera , the FBI 's National Criminal Intelligence Network , and the sharp-eyed woman out at the plant along with the patrolman in Frisco that 'd solved the crime , made the collar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time , " said the Chief , nodding his head and sticking out his lower lip the way experienced people do when they are by-God sure . " They got Gaffney solid , two eyewitnesses , both made positives . Prosecutor 'll cut him a deal if he 'll plead and roll on his buddy . First offense , he 'll maybe do half of a seven-to-ten . " Which is just what happened . I sat in on the interrogation after the lineup , and it did n't take much to get Gaffney to give up the name of the guy he said had masterminded the whole thing . He had met this Fernando Luis Diaz in a bar two nights before the robbery and they 'd gotten drunk together . When Diaz had proposed the robbery , Gaffney had gone along with it . " It was a dumb thing to do , " Gaffney said . " Real dumb . It was kind of a crappy time for me . I was ready for anything . I did n't give a shit . " He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our little cage , a pale , overweight young guy with long greasy brown hair , something kind of doughy about him . " I hope you guys find Diaz and hang him higher'n a fuckin " kite , " he said . And then his anger turned to a whine . " Now I 'm gon na do time for goddamn nothin ' , and it was that Diaz talked me into doing all the heavy lifting , and then he never showed up the next morning at the parking lot out back of the 7-Eleven , where we was supposed to make the split . " So the prosecutor cut his deal and they shipped Gaffney off on the fast road to San Quentin . The Feds had Diaz " name and the make and model of the van he had rented , and when it turned up on the recovered vehicle list , they had that too , wiped clean of useful prints but still containing eleven empty canvas bags marked " LOOMIS ARMORED DELIVERY . " And of course then they had the Avis lease agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got them a ton of information on Diaz . They had his Social Security number , the physical description on his driver 's license ( SEX : M HAIR : BLK EYES : BR HT : 5- ' 07 WT : 155 ) , his last known address , where he banked and when he had made his last deposits and withdrawals , and his Visa card account . They knew when and where he 'd been born ( Alta , Louisiana , November 4th , 1979J , when and whom he had married ( Bernadette Rae Jacks , 3/15/98J and when she divorced him ( 2/27/00 ) . They knew his shoe size ( from a Visa charge and the fact that he was nearsighted ( +I diopter in each eye ) , from the records at Lenscrafters . It is an information age and the more they dug here and there , the more they turned up . Diaz had apparently had a pretty active Internet account through one of the national providers , and he 'd ordered stuff on the Visa account and signed up on a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porno clubs , and all that 's like throwing a rock in a big pond : The ripples go on and on . They had all that , but after three months of the Feds searching nationwide , and our little department - for which read me - checking out every local possibility , nobody could find Diaz . None of the people I talked to who lived anywhere near the last address we had for him admitted ever knowing the guy , and every other lead turned up cold . It was like he had dropped off the face of the earth , taking the million dollars with him . In the meantime , Gaffney had done his part of the deal , and even if it had n't led us to Diaz and the loot right away , the judge gave him a fairly gentle three to five . And in a way , it satisfied everyone . Someone was doing time for the crime and without the expense of a jury trial ; the FBI had got their man , or at least one of them ; our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief and the mayor , and the Federal Banks Insurance Corporation ate the million dollars , which did n't particularly set the local citizens " teeth on edge . And who knew ? Diaz might show up anytime , although without any kind of a photograph or even an eyewitness to what he looked like - Mrs. Symonds 's description of who she saw in the van would have just as well fit the Chief or ex-president Clinton , practically any guy in town but me - there was no way he 'd show up on post office walls or appear on America 's Most Wanted . A million bucks and no casualties probably was n't enough to qualify him for show business anyway . But I was n't satisfied , probably because I was so new at the business . I could n't shake off the feeling that something was n't quite right about the robbery . Then one Sunday afternoon , maybe six months after Gaffney took up residence at the Big Q , Tanisha and I had been talking trash and making leisurely love when she rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gotten when we moved in together and asked me that toughest of all lovers " questions . " What 's eatin " at you , Linc baby ? I do n't think you are all the way with me this afternoon . " " You complainin ' ? " " Aw no , sugar . It 's just that it seem like you be somewhere else , you know what I 'm sayin ' ? " Now understand . Tani 's got a degree from Berkeley in journalism , I 've got one from Sac State in criminal justice , and everywhere outside the bedroom and when we 're , you know , fighting over something or getting it on together , or making some kind of serious decision , we speak pretty much white . It 's second nature for us . Only sometimes , like this , when it 's first nature , our words come out black . I guess it 's what they used to call Ebonics there for a while , although it 's just the way some people grow up talking , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stage , not mindful of who they are supposed to be rather than who they way down deep inside really are . A question of identity , I guess . " I bet both the Queen of England and the Pope have one time or another said , shit , " " is the way Tani put it to me once when we were laughing about what we called our " indahouse " language . " What do you suppose that is in Polish ? " " I do n't know . " Anyway , this time , I said , " I ca n't put that bank robbery we had outta my mind , ca n't let go of it . " " Maybe that 's just " cause you so new at the detective business . That was your first real case . " " Maybe , " I said . " But I ca n't see how that Diaz just sorta evaporated , like some kinds bad dream . I do n't mean got away . I can see how he might be hiding out somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like he never existed in the first place . We have n't got any physical evidence - no prints , no pictures , no hair or nail clippings or pieces of fabric . Nothing . And so far the Feds have n't even turned up anybody remembers ever knowin " the guy . " " Hey , " said Tani , stretching herself out catlike beside me , her voice now again languorous , truly her , " maybe he the little man tha " was n't there . But you the big man tha " was there , or at leas " you was jus " a while ago . Any chance you gon na be again soon ? " THINK IT WAS about then that I began to suspect the truth about the Modoc County Federal Savings &; Loan robbery , but for a long time it was too implausible to tell anybody about and I was still too full of doubt about myself to risk voicing any wild theories . And then time went on and the case slipped back into one of those closed filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Closed , not locked . Tani and I got married , adding one more to the fifty or so black families still floating a little uncertainly in our white county . I got promoted to lieutenant and spent more time with paper and less with perps . Tani got a new contract as lead anchor with the six o'clock desk even though she was more than six months pregnant and had stopped doing standups . The town got a new mayor , who was a pretty good woman , and life sailed along as smoothly as life ever does . And then , after thirty-three months , Gaffney was released on good time and reported in as he was ordered to by the county parole officer . I took the interview in our little cage , where I 'd last seen him during his initial interrogation . This time , Gaffney sat there fit and cheerful , looking at me across the Formica-topped table with a grin on his face . Prison had cleaned him up considerably , like the dough had been baked . " So , Mr. Gaffney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , officer . I 'm gon na handle a little business I got here , some stuff I left in a friend 's basement , and then I 'm , like , outta here . " We knew about the stuff in the friend 's basement . It had been thoroughly searched and inventoried . " Job lined up somewhere ? " I said . " Yeah . Down in the Bay area . " " Doing what ? " " I had a chance to sharpen up some of my computer skills , there in the Q. Got ta job cuttin " code , little place in Cupertino . " I stared at him a moment , noted the smug expression of the successful con artist , and said to myself , to hell with it . " Mr. Gaffney , " I said . " I have this theory . I think you got an idea from all those computer hackers stealing people 's identities , cashing in on their plastic , all that . I got ta hunch there never was any Diaz . I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had something wired onto the accelerator linkage made the engine rev like that . I think you had a whole fake identity for this Diaz built up in people 's files , the social security , the banks , VISA , the DMV , all those agencies , and once you got it started , it kinda grew on its own , people puttin " those whatchmacalems , those cookies ? Things that let Internet vendors know what you 're interested in ? Putting them on this phony Diaz 's web account , and so the name and all his vitals , they just sort of began to expand all across the country , wherever anybody had certain kinds of computer files , this Diaz identity would eventually show up in them . " Gaffney was looking distinctly uncomfortable but he grunted a laugh . " What a load of shit , Lieutenant . Why 'd I wan na do something like that ? " " So 's you could have someone to rat out , give up to the prosecutor , cut a deal . Just like you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokin ' , man ? " " Yeah . It may be bullshit and maybe I 'm overestimating you , but I do n't think so . You 're out in thirty-three months , which you divide that into almost a million bucks , makes about thirty-some grand a month salary for doing pretty easy time . And tax-fucking-free . " Gaffney stood up , smiles and smugness gone . " You done with me ? " " Yeah , Gaffney . I 'm done with you . But I 'll be keeping an eye out and I 'm gon na alert your parole officer down there in the Bay area , we hear you suddenly spending money , investing a million bucks in something , I 'm gon na come looking . " It was an empty threat and Gaffney knew it , and in fact if he did spend some money , I was unaware of it . I never heard anything at all about Gaffney again except once . It was seven years later-our oldest kid , Richard , was in second grade , I 'd been Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , London a new monarch - when I was noodling around one evening with Richard 's little beat-up netbook , which by then , of course , every school kid in the country was carrying . Even though they were new and a little crude then , it was a nifty little thing , whole lot lighter than the ragged old books I carried in grade school , and the kids could reach anything in the world the netnanny 'd allow , which was pretty much anything that would n't make your old maiden aunt blush . Anyway , both kids were tucked in for the night and I was just surfin " around , waiting for Tani to get home from her evening broadcast , and just for the hell of it , I dug out some old notes and punched in FIND : DIAZ , FERNANDO LUIS , and added his Social Security number . In retrospect , I realize I was n't just idly horsing around , that the mystery surrounding the Gaffney-Diaz robbery still rankled . Maybe Tani had been right , what she 'd said those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first case as a detective : I 'd gone from being submerged in my blackness to being nameless in my blues . Then I had a shot at being someone a little different and I could n't bear the threat of failing at it . I tapped the ENTER key and I got a hit right away . The little five-inch bubble-gas screen lit up with one short sentence in 24 point bold . WHOEVER YOU ARE : DO N'T FUCK WITH DIAZ. - DIAZ I thought , oh my God , that Gaffney 's still playing around with this phony creature he built , still playing mind-games . And so I punched in FIND : GAFFNEY , EDWARD ELLSWORTH and his SSN . The screen came back with a bunch of references , mostly newspaper stories and court files from the time of the robbery and his plea and sentencing . The most recent entry , however , was a brief excerpt from a three-year-old story in the Southport Evening Post , which is I guess an Australian newspaper , on the death of " American expatriate and bon vivant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub with two young women , apparently the victim of accidental drowning after too much alcohol or drugs . So , I thought , that 's where the million went . But if Gaffney had been three years dead , was no longer manipulating the electronic identity of Fernando Luis Diaz , who was ? Who or what the hell was Diaz ? Was it some kind of joke Gaffney had arranged to continue after his death ? I supposed that it was technically possible . But why ? It was more mystery than I wanted . I had a good job , great wife , kids . I no longer needed to solve the first mystery of my detection career . In an antic mood , smiling a little ruefully at my own unsettled psychology , I clicked up the URL for the Diaz note and typed in , SCREW YOU , DIAZ , AND THE SERVER YOU RODE IN ON . - LINC MUNDY I had almost forgotten the matter the next morning when a casual query from my bank led me to a frantic half hour on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic trace of Lincoln Eugene Mundy had been wiped from every file I had time to examine : bank account , credit cards , Benevolent and Protective Order of Police , NAACP , and so on . I was thunderstruck . It was clear that Diaz had taken his revenge . I called up Tani at home just before she was to leave for the station , and before she could say a word , I told her in one long breathless rush what had happened , ending with , " Everything , Tani , everything 's gone ! I 'm kind of an unperson ! " There was silence on the line for a moment and then she said , " Who 'd you say this was ? " My heart stopped . And then Tani laughed , that **30;1539;TOOLONG rumbling , throaty laugh , and said , " It 's all right , baby . It 's all right . " And then for the first time I truly knew who I was , and to hell with you Diaz . But thanks , too .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
