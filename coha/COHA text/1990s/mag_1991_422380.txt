Section : News you can use Make the wrong choice and you 'll pay dearly , with costs rising at double-digit rates <p> Given the steady cadence of bleak headlines , you had to figure it was coming : In the year ahead , health-care insurance will siphon 13 to 20 percent more from your pocket than it did in this one . The glimmer amid the gloom , however , is that many employers , truly panicked over runaway costs , are seeing the light . They are dangling incentives to choose health-care options that cut the cost to the company  --  and , not incidentally , to you . <p> This mingled package of bad and good news is likely to land on your desk with a thump within the next few weeks , when 60 percent of employees choose their 1992 benefits . A hurried , last-minute decision could cost you big money , given that the average U.S. family will spend at least $1,000 on medical-insurance premiums next year . <p> For the 3 in 5 insured employees who still opt fortraditional fee-for-service coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , the question is whether it has become an unaffordable indulgence . Considering this year 's projected premium increase of 20 percent for a typical fee-for-service plan , it may finally be time for serious rethinking . At the other end of the cost scale from fee for service is the health maintenance organization ( HMO ) , which provides both preventive care and treatment for just the cost of the premium , plus a small per-visit fee . Intriguing options lie between . <p> Hybrid choice . You may have never thought , for example , about point of service , a hybrid plan now used by 7 million insured employees . It is a fee-for-service plan crossed with an HMO , for people who want the option of choosing their own doctor at least some of the time . In effect , you sign up for an HMO , but whenever you need care you decide whether to pay $5 to $10 to visit the HMO or see a private doctor instead . If you go to a private physician , you typically get about half the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent from most fee-for-service plans . Still , you can save 25 percent or more on your total outlay compared with fee for service . <p> A related version , the preferred provider organization ( PPO ) , has been around for several years . In a PPO , you get all or most of your care from private doctors , who charge the insurer according to a negotiated rate schedule , rather than going to an HMO . As with an HMO , patients pay only $5 to $10 for each visit . But unlike an HMO , patients can be partly reimbursed if they seek care from doctors or hospitals outside the negotiated arrangement . PPO members can decide for themselves when they need treatment and which of the affiliated doctors they 'll see . Ina point-of-service plan , on the other hand , any care you get within the HMO is " managed " by a doctor who decides whether you should get care and if so which doctor to see . The premiums for typical family coverage in 1992 will be $1,536 for a point-of-service plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By this yardstick , fee for service does n't look so bad  --  butother expenses are typically far higher . <p> In any plan that allows private care , part of the expense is the deductible , an out-of-pocket figure that must be exceeded before you see your first dollar of reimbursement . Single participants in a point-of-service plan will need to spend an average of $250 outside the HMO , and families $500 , before hitting the reimbursement threshold . And many plans strictly limit the number of visits to private doctors . You would n't want a plan that wo n't pay for needed weekly visits to a private allergist , for instance . <p> Roger Taylor , a physician who heads the health-care group at the Wyatt Co. , a major benefits consulting firm , suggests becoming much more selective about your health-care coverage . Many couples , for example , wo n't make more than one visit each to a doctor this year , spending a grand total of $110 or so including a prescription . Yet they may stick with a plan costing them $680 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them until they hit a $1,000 deductible . If they have no loyalty to a particular private doctor , they might be much better off with an HMO or a point-of-service plan . <p> A fee-for-service plan can be made more affordable . Simply choosing a higher deductible can carve a fat slice off the cost . Next year , for example , one large U.S. company will charge families $240 , or $20 a month , for its lowest-cost plan carrying a deductible of $6,000 . A gilt-edged plan , with a $600 deductible , will cost $1,440 , or $120 a month . The best choice , say benefits analysts , usually is the mid-range option . For this company , families pay $1,080 , or $90 a month , for a plan with a $1,500 deductible . That 's a realistic option for people who do n't foresee their medical expenses rising out of sight next year . <p> A low-deductible plan may come with a seemingly sizable perk these days : coverage of preventive care . Some plans , for example , will cover well-baby care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover tests like mammograms and Pap smears . You will be reimbursed for 70 to 80 percent of your costs . For 1992 , many Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans will charge an additional premium of $90 for families and $36 for individuals to cover certain tests . Many other insurers pay for the tests and leave the premium alone  --  obviously a better arrangement . <p> Medical savings account . One opportunity is largely ignored . For several years , many companies have let employees deduct pretax cash from their paychecks , usually up to $2,500 to $3,500 annually , and deposit it into a company-administered medical reimbursement account . The stash reimburses you for medical expenses your health plan does n't pay . A recent study by A. Foster Higgins , a benefits consulting firm , shows that fewer than 20 percent of eligible employees set up the accounts . Experts attribute the underuse to an IRS rule that stipulates that cash left in an account at the end of the year goes to the company . The answer , of course , is to figure your out-of-pocket expenses over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account to make sure you 'll drain the reserve . <p> Most people will save money even if some is left over , since deducting the money from pretax income lowers your taxes . A married person earning $30,000 who takes the standard deduction and puts $500 into a spending account , for example , would bring taxable income down to $29,500 , saving $113 in taxes . An average account starts off with $594 and has $33 left at the end of the year . Still , there 's no need to forfeit anything . As the year draws to a close , leftover funds can be spent on common medical needs such as an extra pair of glasses or a refill of a prescription drug you take regularly . <p> Sifting through the many health-plan options has become so onerous that some firms , including Nynex , Merck and Citicorp , have developed interactive phone and computer programs to help their employees . The systems let them plug in a salary and different options to find out how much they would have to pay out , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The worst thing to do is give up and let your employer choose . That is likely to result in a fee-for-service account with a high deductible and no frills . Armed with a pencil and a calculator , most people can figure out a better way . A year 's worth of health care <p> Project your out-of-pocket medical expenses for the next year before choosing a health-care plan . To help you focus on your crystal ball , U.S. News created the Ables  --  a couple and two children ages 6 and 10  --  and the medical expenses typical of such a family . In one year , various Ables will make five visits to doctors . One will need emergency-room care and overnight hospitalization . Each will get a dental checkup . For them , the obvious choice seems to be an HMO . But each family is different  --  and crystal balls can cloud up . TRADITIONAL PLAN ( fee for service ) <p> These plans reimburse 70 to 80 percent of most expenses after a deductible is satisfied . The Ables ' plan , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Advantage : You choose the health care provider . <p> Disadvantages : Out-of-pocket expenses can be high . Paperwork can be a nuisance , since you must file claim forms to get reimbursed  --  which often takes weeks . HMO ( Health Maintenance Organization ) <p> All care comes from a center or approved doctors . The plan assumes a monthly premium of $115 . There is no deductible ; a charge of $5 to $10 per treatment is often levied . <p> Advantages : Lower premiums and out-of pocket costs ; no claim forms for reimbursement . Preventive care is included . <p> Disadvantages : Choice of tests or services is left to a primary care physician , not the patient ; no coverage for non-emergency care provided outside the system . POINT-OF-SERVICE PLAN <p> Patients can get care either within an HMO , with almost no out-of-pocket expenses , or through private care , for which half of most fees will be covered , after they pay a $500 deductible . The Ables ' plan carries a monthly premium of $128 . <p> Advantages : You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can opt for private care and get partly reimbursed . <p> Disadvantages : More expensive than either an HMO or traditional plan if private care is used .

Consider these quick tips that cut costs while still preserving essential coverage . <p> <p> 1 . Switch your deductible . If you do n't expect heavy medical expenses in the year ahead , why pay extra for a low deductible ? Moving from a lower to a higher one  --  from $500 to $4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in premiums . <p> <p> 2 . Think untraditionally . A you-pick-the-doctor plan could cost a family $1,400 this year just for premiums , plus another $1,000 out of pocket . A health maintenance organization ( HMO ) is much cheaper , but you sacrifice choice and convenience . Two alternatives that offer flexibility plus savings : an individual practice association ( IPA ) , which lets you see private doctors , or a point-of-service plan , which gives you the choice of an HMO or an IPA and generally pays 50 percent of the cost for private care . <p> <p> 3 . Divorce your spouse 's insurance . Many firms charge a family premium to a married person with a dependent spouse , with or without children . Childless couples who both work might save up to 25 percent by signing up separately as singles . <p> <p> 4 . Think healthy . Some traditional plans now pay 80 percent of the cost of well-baby visits and mammograms at no increase in the premium . Employees who can use both extras could save about $400 in one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with jargon  --  and you 'll need to understand it to make a sound choice of health plans . Here are often used terms , deciphered . <p> Premium . Payment for coverage , usually deducted from each paycheck . <p> Deductible . Amount paid out of pocket before insurance kicks in . Can be a flat amount or a percentage of salary . Copayment or coinsurance . That portion of a covered expense you pay . <p> Fee-for-service or indemnity plan . This is the traditional health plan , in which the choice of doctor or hospital is yours . After you pay a deductible , insurance covers 70 to 80 percent of approved charges and you pay the other 20 to 30 percent . It is flexible  --  and expensive . <p> Health maintenance organization ( HMO ) . A plan that provides most health care , including checkups , at a medical center and affiliated hospitals for a set premium and sometimes an additional $5 to $10 for some services . Generally the cheapest coverage . <p> Individual practice association ( IPA ) . An HMO variant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in a central setting . Unaffiliated physicians or hospitals are not covered . Premiums and fees are similar to those in an HMO . <p> Preferred provider organization ( PPO ) . Simply a list of doctors and hospitals that provide care at rates approved by the insurer . You decide which providers to use . The premium is slightly higher than for an HMO . Care outside the PPO , called " out of network " care , is typically reimbursed at 50 to 60 percent of the negotiated rates . <p> Point-of-service plan . For a premium of about 10 percent above the rates at an HMO or IPA , you can go to an HMO or IPA , or to any private doctor or hospital . Private care typically is reimbursed at 50 percent of the rates set by the HMO or IPA . <p> Medical spending account . A company-run account into which you can set aside part of your pay each year to cover anticipated medical expenses . The funds are deducted from pretax income , reducing taxes . <p> CHEAP ALTERNATIVES GOING PUBLIC TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs sponsored by hospitals and medical societies is one way that virtually everyone can trim medical bills . Cholesterol and blood pressure checks are established shopping-mall phenomena , but you can also be tested at health fairs and in mobile vans for diabetes , tuberculosis , poor vision , glaucoma and poor hearing . The community-relations departments of most hospitals can alert you to health fairs and other public screenings , which as a rule charge nothing or perhaps a fee of $5 to $10 . <p> Mammograms are rarely free except to low-income women , but you could get one done at a hospital and save half the usual charge of about $100 . The American Cancer Society , ( 800 ) 227-2345 , can provide a list of a few questions to ask a mammogram operator before the scan to improve the chances that the procedure will be done accurately . The cancer society 's 57 national divisions can also direct you to nearby free and low-cost screenings for skin , colon and other cancers . Any local ACS office can supply dates and locations for upcoming screenings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of these doctors would normally charge about $50 for their time . The societies say the doctors do the exams themselves and will explain their findings with no pressure to make an office appointment . A few examples : The American Academy of Dermatology holds free skin-cancer exams throughout the year at hospitals , state fairs and even in screened booths at shopping malls . For information on sites , write the AAD 's communications department at P.O. Box 1661 , Evanston , IL 60204 . Men who choose to take their shirts off will get a thorough upper-body exam ; for women , only exposed skin is checked . Urologists at over 1,000 hospitals and private offices conduct free prostate-cancer exams every September for men over 40 . For next year 's dates , write Prostate Cancer Education Council , 230 Park Avenue South , New York , NY 10003 . The American Academy of Ophthalmology has a list of 7,000 doctors who have agreed to provide free eye care for anyone over 65 unable to pay charges that Medicare or private insurance wo n't cover . Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenings is decidedly uneven . A finger-stick test for cholesterol that takes a few drops of blood from a fingertip , for instance , is seldom reliable ( though some hospitals do sponsor the more accurate fasting test that takes blood from a vein ) . In all such tests , techniques and technicians vary in care and thoroughness . A free test that proves positive should probably be repeated by your own physician ; that is usually covered by insurance . <p>
