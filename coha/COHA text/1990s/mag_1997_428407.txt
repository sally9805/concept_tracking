Money is no object for the Getty trust , as it builds its collections and does good works around the globe ; now it has a New home overlooking Los Angeles <p> A fellow trustee asked Gordon Getty a few months ago if he thought his late father would have liked the new J. Paul Getty Center that carries his name , an enormous complex of rough-hewn travertine and enameled metal that now hovers over Los Angeles like a modernist cathedral of art . " Oh , he would have liked it , " replied the youngest son of the oil baron that Fortune magazine once labeled the richest man in America , " but he would n't have liked the cost . " Designed by Richard Meier , this spectacular museum and research campus on the ridges of the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains , which will open to the public with great fanfare on December 16 , cost close to a billion dollars . Never before has so much been spent to house an art institution in the United States . <p> The long-awaited new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus  --  opens this month . <p> The new Getty monument to art , which visitors reach on computerized trains that ascend e la Disneyland , has an odd heritage . Jean Paul Getty , who died in 1976 at the age of 83 , relished his reputation as a skinflint collector who preferred a bargain to a Botticelli . He liked to wield his checkbook only when other collectors stumbled into harsh times . He purchased from victims of the stock market crash of 1929 , for example , and from fearful Europeans preparing to flee in the uncertain years before World War II . <p> " He collected paintings , " says John Walsh , the present director of the Getty Museum , " without much flair , without much love , and without much money . " Getty 's naivete about painting , in fact , was matched only by his disturbing take on politics . During the era of his early purchases , he extolled Benito Mussolini as " the greatest son of Italy since Augustus " and described the Nazi German troops that conquered Poland as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a San Francisco composer , is surely embellishing his father 's reputation with the notion that he would have liked this modern masterpiece . <p> Old man Getty probably would have thrown a tantrum . He abhorred modern stuff . He liked to feel engulfed in the worlds of ancient Greece and Rome . According to one friend , he even fantasized that the spirit of the Roman emperor Hadrian lived inside himself . He ordered the earlier J. Paul Getty Museum , overlooking the Pacific in Malibu , designed in the form of an ancient Roman villa . When it opened in 1974 , it provoked a gale of guffaws from architecture critics . The likes of Meier were never for Jean Paul Getty . <p> But Getty 's whims and passions no longer matter ; unlike a host of other wealthy American collectors , he did not impose a stringent set of rules on how to use his bequest . He was not Dr. Albert C. Barnes , whose strictures on hanging , arranging , moving and exhibiting his paintings still haunt the keepers of the fabulous Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one of history 's most generous acts of patronage , Getty bequeathed enormous wealth to a trust and charged it only with running a museum named after him and fostering " the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge . " <p> With an endowment now worth more than $4 billion , the Getty Trust is the wealthiest private art institution in the world . The trust spends at least five times more than the Metropolitan Museum of Art on acquiring new paintings and other works of art . When a painting worth tens of millions of dollars comes on the market , only the Getty can outbid determined Japanese and American collectors . Even its most generous and altruistic activities reek of wealth . For example , all museums , including the Getty , have small staffs of conservators who maintain the paintings and other works in their collections . But the Getty Trust also finances a unique institute with a staff of almost a hundred who travel throughout the world , conserving sites and teaching local teams in the process  --  at the tomb of Queen Nefertari in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , the old colonial historical center of Quito in Ecuador , and a host of other exotic places . <p> In an era of downsizing and diminished public spending , the Getty operation seems so profligate to outsiders that it is no surprise that a jealous and resentful art world is ready to chortle at any mistake , any fumble . " I 've always said that Getty-watching is like going to the Indianapolis 500 , " museum director Walsh laments to me in an interview . " You 're not there to see them go round and round . You 're there to see them hit the wall . " That may explain why Thomas Hoving , former director of the Metropolitan and editor of Connoisseur magazine , took after the Getty Museum with such relish in the 1980s when evidence mounted that it may have been hoodwinked with a $7 million purchase of a sixth-century b.c . Greek kouros ( a larger-than-life statue of a youth ) . Hoving concluded that a disreputable museum curator had knowingly purchased a fake because he resented Getty bosses that " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . " The case against the kouros is still unproven , but enough doubt has arisen for the museum to mount it in an exhibition that details the arguments for and against the statue 's authenticity . The Getty believes the kouros to be authentic . <p> Some anti-Getty sniping can strike an outsider as petty . Several scholars , chosen to spend a year doing research at the Getty , complained a few years ago that they were treated too well : tastefully furnished apartments with maid service , catered lunches with excellent wine , servings of tea and cookies every afternoon , no pressure to produce . " It 's unusual to be somewhere where you do n't have to do anything , " groused Swiss architectural theorist Stanislaus von Moos in 1993 . " I could not stay another year . " Another scholar derided the program , which brings a dozen scholars together every year , as " a think tank where nobody 's thinking . " The whining was overdone . " Getting a Getty is like winning the lottery , " said Luigi Ballerini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California at Los Angeles . " Anyone who complains . . . should be shot . " <p> Despite its behemoth wealth and the excitement of the stunning Meier complex , where most of its activities are based , the Getty Trust is still not a major influence in American artistic circles . Although its influence grows constantly , even its riches may not be great enough in the modern market to amass a collection as magnificent as that of the Met , the National Gallery of Art in Washington , the Art Institute of Chicago , the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston or the Philadelphia Museum of Art . Undoubtedly aware of this reality , the board , led by president Harold Williams , decided in the early 1980s to channel a good deal of spending into activities that might make an impact on the art world in different ways . <p> The new direction taken by Williams , who became president in 1981 and will retire on his 70th birthday next January 5 , has enhanced the reputation of the Getty Trust . The son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished career as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Jimmy Carter , chairman of the board of Norton Simon , Inc. , and dean of the graduate school of management at UCLA . <p> Williams helped power the Getty to incredible wealth . Jean Paul Getty had left the museum 12 percent of the stock of the Getty Oil Company as its endowment . Williams aligned those shares with the 40 percent controlled by Gordon Getty in a bitter fight in 1984 against the oil company 's board . With majority control , Gordon Getty and Williams agreed to sell the company to Texaco for double what the shares had been worth a year before . That deal and careful investments ballooned the trust 's endowment from $1.2 billion in 1982 to $4.3 billion now . <p> The Williams philosophy of expansion accounted for the creation of the conservation institute . He also developed the costly Getty Research Institute , which boasts a distinguished library and the scholars program . The library 's material on art dealers is already so renowned that the Metropolitan de-posited its own collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift last year . Since the reign of Williams began , the Getty Trust has also established an information institute that encourages the exchange of cultural data by computer , an education institute that lobbies for more art and art history classes in schools , a leadership institute that trains curators and museum administrators , and a grant program that spends more than $6 million a year supporting museums and scholars . <p> Yet , despite the breadth of these activities , the Getty Trust has been aware that without a first-rate museum it will always be regarded as a second-rate institution . The museum was decidedly second-rate when Getty died . The alchemy of transforming dross into something stellar fell to John Walsh , an urbane , soft-spoken scholar of 17th-century Dutch painting who was named director of the Getty Museum by Williams in 1983 . At the time , Walsh was curator of European paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston . J. Paul Getty had died seven years earlier and left behind a fine group of 18th-century French furniture , a better than average collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of European paintings . <p> All the Getty holdings were then in Malibu , in a near replica of the Villa dei Papyri in Herculaneum that was buried under volcanic mud at the same time as Pompeii when Mount Vesuvius erupted in a.d. 79 . This Romanized building in Malibu , which Getty never left London to see , struck many intellectuals as schlock ; it reminded the novelist Joan Didion of something " dreamed up by a mafia don . " But the villa seemed to please many ordinary visitors who wandered in its gardens and were cooled by its waters . While they may also have enjoyed the Greek and Roman statues inside the villa , they were probably disappointed by upstairs galleries too dark and dingy to display paintings well . Walsh , in any case , had few to show off . " I ca n't exaggerate how unworthy of an important museum the painting collection was then , " he recalls today . <p> But Walsh had and still has incredible sums at his disposal . The most recent annual report of the Getty Trust lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units in 1996 for " collections development . " In some years , the trust has spent even more . In contrast , the Metropolitan spent $9.5 million on acquisitions in 1996 ; individual donors and foundations gave another $10 million to buy art that year . The National Gallery of Art spent $12.4 million on acquisitions in 1996 . <p> Meier abandoned his trademark white surfaces for the Gett Center ; Italian travertine and enameled-metal panels set a classic tone . <p> The recent adventures of Van Gogh 's Irises dramatically demonstrate the economic might of the Getty . In 1987 , Australian businessman Alan Bond purchased the 1889 painting at a Sotheby 's auction in New York for $53.9 million . That was the highest price ever paid for a single work of art and made headlines worldwide . But Bond had overreached himself . His business empire soon crumbled , and he could not pay Sotheby 's all that he owed . The Getty Museum came to the rescue , agreeing in secret negotiations to buy the painting in 1990 . The price was not disclosed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cut-rate . The price may even have topped the 1987 record . <p> Walsh has used his bounty over the past 15 years to augment the Greek and Roman holdings and create important collections of illuminated medieval manuscripts , European sculpture , drawings and photographs . But the allure of a major museum depends on its paintings . Getty Trust president Williams tried years ago to persuade a former boss , California corporate magnate Norton Simon , to merge his fabulous collection of paintings with the Getty 's . But Simon , who died in 1993 , had put his entire collection inside the former Pasadena Art Museum  --  which had agreed to change its name to the Norton Simon Museum and devote itself entirely to his gift  --  and there it would stay . Despite many wise purchases by Walsh and his staff , the Getty 's collection of paintings still does not outshine that of the Norton Simon Museum . But it comes close now , an astounding achievement . <p> Walsh and Williams have made no attempt to include every period or artist in the Getty collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you are filling all the squares of a stamp album , " Walsh tells me , " you are mediocre . " Instead , the museum adopted the policy of trying to buy a masterpiece whenever it came on the market , no matter who painted it . ( One exclusion : the museum does not collect 20th-century paintings . ) Walsh and his staff followed a simple philosophy . While it could never be the Louvre , the Getty could still be very good . As former curator George Goldner , who did most of the buying for the Getty from 1989 to 1993 , has put it , " I ca n't be Robert Redford , but I still fix my hair in the morning . " <p> A catalog of some of the Getty 's most newsworthy purchases of recent years , and their reported prices , offers an insight into the eclectic and distinguished nature of the changing collection . The Getty bought Pierre-Auguste Renoir 's La Promenade in 1989 for $17.7 million , Edouard Manet 's The Rue Mosnier With Flags in 1989 for $26.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $35.2 million , Francisco de Goya 's Bullfight : Suerte de Varas in 1992 for $7.4 million , Rembrandt 's Daniel and Cyrus Before the Idol Bel in 1995 for $7.5 million , Fra Bartolommeo 's The Rest on the Flight into Egypt with Saint John the Baptist in 1995 for $22.5 million , Paul Cezanne 's Still Life With Apples in 1996 for $25 million , and Nicolas Poussin 's Landscape With Calm in 1997 for $26 million . In all , the Getty has bought 140 paintings since Walsh took over 14 years ago . <p> Getty officials deny accusations that their museum 's wealth distorts the art market and drives prices up with purchases like these . " If we drive it up , we lose , " Williams tells me during an interview in his new offices . The case is impossible to prove one way or another ; no one knows what the market would be without the Getty . But its winning bids often set record prices . In the case of the Renoir and the Manet bought in 1989 , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these artists had ever cost before . <p> The Getty 's deep pockets have provoked the greatest resentment in Britain . The British have the most thriving and liberal art market in Europe . Unlike France , Italy and Spain , Britain allows important works of art to leave if no one in the country can match the price offered for them . The export is held up for several months to give British buyers a chance to come up with the funds . Between 1993 and 1996 , the Getty bought 11 paintings and drawings worth $78 million through this system . The Getty purchases accounted for 70 percent of the value of all the works of art that the British had allowed to export after a delay . <p> It is not surprising that in Britain , as Roger Hollest of the Phillips auction house in London told a Los Angeles Times reporter , " for some people , the very name ' Getty ' is a red rag to a bull . " In a celebrated campaign , Britain stopped the Getty in 1994 from buying The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female nudes by the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova . The sale to the Getty was rejected by the British government when the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery of Scotland together came up with $11.6 million to match the purchase price . Ironically , the two British museums were able to buy The Three Graces only after receiving a $1.5 million donation from J. Paul Getty II , the third son of the oil baron . Getty , who has lived in London since 1971 , insisted that he was motivated only by regard for the British art world , not by any animosity toward his father . <p> Whatever its standing in Britain , the Getty Museum , in Walsh 's view , now has international respect . " When I took over in 1983 there was this caricature abroad of all this Getty oil money in the hands of California vulgarians , " Walsh says . " But they have a clearer picture of us now . We 're taken seriously . " <p> In 1984 , the Getty Trust selected Richard Meier as its architect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Malibu villa would be retained and refashioned for the study and exhibition of Greek and Roman antiquities ) and five other buildings for the various other Getty activities . Meier , who won the Pritzker Prize , architecture 's most celebrated accolade , that same year , was the leading American disciple of Le Corbusier . Almost all his buildings bore the same signature : gleaming white walls of enameled metal wrought in cylinders , rectangles and other geometric forms , with daring outer staircases and railings giving them the look of an ocean liner . When hired by the Getty , he had designed the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the Museum for the Decorative Arts in Frankfurt ; he would later design the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona . <p> The Getty Center project took 13 years to complete and cost almost ten times the original estimate . Los Angeles officials made it clear that white enamel gleaming in the California sun would be unbearable ; Meier , for the first time in his career , hunted for a suitable stone . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I looked at every stone in the world . " After three years , he settled on Italian travertine specially cleft into a rough surface . In all , 14,000 tons of travertine were shipped from Italy . Meier did not forgo the use of enameled metal  --  but he colored it light beige , much like the stone . <p> Meier designed the Getty Center so that it followed the curve of the heavily traveled San Diego Freeway beneath the hills . Motorists can see it from different angles as they round their way north or south on the freeway . " You see the Center . It disappears . It reappears . It 's exciting , " said the white-haired Meier in his gleaming white 10th Avenue offices looking out on the midtown Manhattan skyline . " In contrast , I sit here and look at the Empire State Building . It 's wonderful . But it 's no mystery . " <p> The Malibu villa built by Jean Paul Getty , who started it all , is being renovated , to reopen as a museum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with artistic conflict . Williams and other Getty officials disappointed Meier by bringing in outsiders to supplant some of his work . Thierry Despont , a French-born architect based in New York , was hired to design the interiors of the museum galleries that would display French furniture and other decorative art . Meier had wanted bare contemporary galleries , but Despont decorated the rooms with damask , silk and faux marble . " What they wanted and got were period rooms , " said Meier , making it clear that " period rooms " was a genre that did not fit into his own scheme of contemporary architecture . <p> The Getty Trust also hired Los Angeles artist Robert Irwin to design a three-acre garden with 500 species of plants  --  a garden as " a living work of art "  --  on the grounds between the museum and the research institute . Williams evidently wanted the complex to have some prominent input from the local art scene . Meier , who insists that no other contractor has ever foisted other artists on him , objected even more angrily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex as designed with " an Aristotelian structure , an order and a logic . . . with as little as possible left to chance . " In his view , the Getty fractured that Aristotelian order and logic by commissioning Irwin to fashion a personal work of art in a space that Meier created . " That 's what hurts the most , " Meier said . <p> Yet there is no doubt that the complex as a whole is Meier 's work of art , surely his most remarkable and important achievement . From afar , the Getty Center looks like a medieval Spanish hill town with castle , church and city hall clustered together on top . The rough travertine makes the complex seem aged and permanent . Recently I ascended the hill and then strolled among the low-lying buildings ; the enameled metal and daring staircases and sheets of glass emerged in all their modernity , yet somehow never clashed with the slabs of old-fashioned stone . Walking from one gallery to another in the museum , I came upon magnificent vistas of the Los Angeles area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west , the UCLA campus two miles to the east and the rest of the city just beyond . If the vistas are framed by walls of travertine , there is a special excitement , for the great hovering presence of the stone made me feel as if I were peering down from some place very old or timeless . <p> " Jean Paul Getty might not like this kind of architecture , " Meier told me . " But , many years from now , no one will remember that Jean Paul Getty was once the richest man in America . People will have no idea who he was . But they will know that this art center on the hill is named after him . And that should please him .
