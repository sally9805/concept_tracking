Bitter arguments between the President and the Congress are built into our constitutional system . What is n't necessarily built in are the bitter arguments of recent years over the constitutional division of labor itself . Controversies over a wide range of issues  --  independent-counsel prosecutions , Supreme Court nominees , funding of the Nicaraguan contras , the Persian Gulf War , the federal budget deficit  --  all turned into fights about the separation of powers between the Legislative and Executive branches . <P> During the era of divided government , conservatives developed an enormous and historically uncharacteristic enthusiasm for presidential power . Conservative legal scholars produced elaborate theories establishing to their own satisfaction that the independent counsel is unconstitutional ; that the President not only needs but already has a line-item veto over congressional appropriations ; and so on . This trend culminated in President Bush 's breathtaking assertion  --  never put to the test  --  that he could send half a million American troops into battle halfway around the globe without so much as a nod to Congress 's constitutional power to " declare war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can see the Republican enthusiasm for Executive authority fading and a new respect growing for the prerogatives of the legislature . <P> But Democrats also face a test of their principles . And with control of both branches , the Democrats are in a position to put their principles into practice . Democrats could serve the Constitution and the country by making a " grand bargain " between Congress and the White House . In foreign policy , the President should acknowledge and begin honoring Congress 's war power . In domestic and budgetary policy , Congress should restore meaning to the President 's veto power by giving him the line-item veto . Fair enough ? <P> Congress 's war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the Constitution . There have always been debates over the extent of the President 's authority to respond to unexpected emergencies . But the real erosion began after World War II . During the cold war era , there were claims that the hair-trigger nuclear stalemate made the notion of consulting Congress obsolete . From Vietnam through the invasion of Panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " war . " In the 1980s the issue was usually whether Congress was trying to " micromanage " foreign-policy issues short of actually sending in the troops . By 1991 , however , President Bush could claim with a straight face that he did n't need congressional approval for Operation Desert Storm : a deliberate , unhurried , post-cold war decision to start a war .
