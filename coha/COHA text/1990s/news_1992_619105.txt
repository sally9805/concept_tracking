<p> BLAME <p> CONGRESS <p> Editor  --  This is not the " George Bush Recession " ! A major part of the blame for the recession lies with our Democratic Congress ! Job formation boomed in the early ' 80s , aided by a low capital gains tax . The capital gains tax was raised in 1986 and in 1989 George Bush urged Congress to lower it . Congress very nearly passed a lower tax on capital gains until Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said it was only fair to the rich . Naturally , it is rich people who have the capital to start companies to make jobs but they will hesitate to risk their capital if their reward is to see the profits go to the " Tax and Spend " Democratic Congress for pork barrel projects and things like the savings &; loan bailout . Congress gives lip service to global competitiveness but they ignore the fact that the cost of new capital in the U.S. needed for job formation is the highest in the world ! Both the unemployed and the working people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital gains tax . <p> BARBARA MacROSTIE <p> Los Gatos <p> AGRIBUSINESS WELFARE <p> Editor  --  Governor Wilson is right to take a hard look at welfare costs in light of the state 's budget crisis , but he should n't limit his review to families in poverty . One major recipient of state welfare is California agribusiness , which receives vast subsidies from taxpayers in the form of water , which is a public resource , delivered at prices far below market prices . <p> In the meantime , agribusiness , which contributes about 3 percent to California 's economic output , gobbles up over 80 percent of its water , to the detriment of its economy and environment . Urban water users are asked to put up with brown lawns , and California industry begins to move elsewhere in search of water , while wealthy corporate farmers are given every incentive to waste water through subsidized prices . Agribusiness also feeds at the federal welfare trough , by taking federal crop support payments for water-intensive crops that are otherwise uneconomical to grow , such as rice and cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary Cadillac- driving , welfare recipient , he should look to agribusiness rather than the inner city . Ending California 's system of water welfare will benefit our taxpayers , our economy , and our fish . <p> LAWRENCE P. KOLB <p> Oakland <p> DUKE 'S INFLUENCE ? <p> Editor  --  With great dismay , I learned that Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Leo McCarthy has endorsed a modified version of Governor Wilson 's proposal to limit welfare payments for recent arrivals . <p> It is yet another confirmation that racist David Duke is rapidly becoming one of the most influential political figures in the United States . <p> In late November , Klansman Duke received 55 percent of the white vote in the Louisiana governor 's race . His thinly disguised racist appeals to voters were marked by verbal attacks on welfare recipients and immigrants . Shortly thereafter , Republican Governor Wilson began condemning indigents and immigrants for the current recession and proposed Draconian cuts in welfare programs . <p> Now , Leo McCarthy seeks to fur ther legitimize this contemptible politics by culling out the most popular elements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood dogs , Duke snarls , Wilson growls and McCarthy barks . One can only wonder which McCarthy operative has the responsibility of monitoring the Duke presidential campaign for the purpose of obtaining additional ideas . <p> It now appears that the Greens have qualified for the California ballot . If McCarthy is a Democratic candidate for Senate this fall , they should seriously consider fielding a candidate against him . <p> RICHARD ESTES <p> Davis <p> A SPOTTED OWL 'S LIFE <p> Editor  --  In your article about the spotted owl controversy ( Chronicle , January 10 ) , reporter Carl Nolte describes the owl as " a small and reclusive bird that lives deep in old- growth forests . " Mr. Nolte has obviously never had any first-hand experience with these fascinating birds . <p> Adult spotted owls are fairly large members of the owl family , 12 to 14 inches long with the males significantly larger than the females . Like other owls , spotted owls are nocturnal , which might be interpreted as " reclusive . " However , spotted owls readily respond to human imitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hands of observers . <p> Here on the Mendocino coast , where little old-growth forest remains , spotted owls live and breed in second-growth forests . Ted Wooster 's survey for the Department of Fish and Game found 250 spotted owl sites in a five county area  --  Napa , Marin , Sonoma , Lake and Mendocino counties  --  with 90 percent of the sites in managed , second- growth forests . Mr. Wooster described one pair of spotted owls which nested in Bothe State Park in the Napa Valley and produced young six years out of 11 . <p> While the future of the spotted owl does deserve our attention and concern , protective measures must be based on fact and not on misinformation . <p> NANCY BARTH <p> Fort Bragg ( Mendocino County ) <p> IT 'S NOT A MATCH <p> Editor  --  Regarding your editorial entitled " Housing Boon " ( Chronicle , January 15 ) , you state that with 700,000 new residents coming to California next year , a residential housing industry in the doldrums , and $ 225 million seed money from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes in the state  --  we have a perfect match . <p> I agree . My question is , will there be a forest products industry still operating in the state to supply the lumber to build these homes , and will it be affordable to any but the very rich ? <p> Your advocacy in other editorials of environmental regulation of the forest products industry would seem to dilute the perfect match . The way the environmentalists are arbitrarily turning the forest products industry into an enormous bird sanctuary , I do n't feel that you should be touting new housing schemes . It is not a match  --  period . <p> DUKE YOLO <p> Windsor ( Sonoma County ) <p> SAN JOSE GIANTS <p> Editor  --  Am anxiously awaiting letters in the next few days . The weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth is about to begin . Quote : Oh Gawd ! How can this be happening ? The San Francisco Giants are our team . So we are negative . So we have turned thumbs down on every single idea and proposal . So we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot . So what has any of that got to do with it ? The Giants belong to San Francisco . They are ours ! <p> Cry your hearts out , San Francisco  --  cause it is going to happen . San Jose voters voted for the new Sports Arena , future home of the San Jose Sharks . They are so popular that it has been very difficult to get tickets and then we have to drive all the way to the Cow Palace to see them . After we finally get there the Sharks do n't play so hot , but we love'em anyway . Just think of the enthusiastic support we 'll give to our very own Giants playing in our very own stadium . <p> The San Jose voters have already voted once to support building a baseball stadium and with the leadership of our new mayor , Susan Hammer , the new stadium and the San Jose Giants will be a reality in 1996 . San Jose Giants  --  that has such a nice ring . <p> SALLY BONVILLAIN <p> San Jose <p> CUT MANAGEMENT JOBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the departments . Supervisor Jim Gonzalez wrings his hands and says it will involve laying off 1,000 city employees , which would mean " fewer gardeners , librarians , bus drivers and police officers . " ( A list of decidedly functional job titles ! ) Although the entire municipal worker list of 26,000 will bear scrutiny , first to be looked at are the large numbers of payrollers in middle and upper management whose over generous salaries call for reduction or outright elimination . <p> MICHAEL TALBOT <p> San Francisco <p> RAYMOND H. CLARY <p> Editor  --  It is with gratitude toward his unstinting love for Golden Gate Park that all San Franciscans celebrate the recently concluded life of Raymond H. Clary . His two books on the park , garnered from reading what must have been all of the park minutes , plus many newspapers including The Chronicle , are great contributions to our history . His life was an example of love . He dedicated it to uncovering true information ( plus his own opinions ) on how San Francisco came to have Golden Gate Park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  Anyone who believes the official statement that unemployment has risen to 7.1 percent has not noticed how uncannily the streets of U.S. cities resemble Dorothea Lange 's photographs of the Great Depression . To do so would require one to live in a bunker , a coma , Blackhawk or the White House . <p> Barbara and Millie may be shielded from harsh reality , but George Bush can hardly be accused of such innocence . Any administration capable of defining America 's wetlands out of existence is quite capable of jimmying statistics in an election year to hide a depression . <p> GRAY BRECHIN <p> Berkeley
