for marie She was in her thirties , a poet , and she was afraid to fly . Her brother was dying in another city . She did not have a husband or children , but she had a job that held her in the city where she lived . Until her brother went home to die , her job was work she gave her time to . But now it was taking time from her . She could feel it . <p> She read poems that students wrote ; she read poems in books and in the evenings she lived with them , thought of what she would say about them next day in the classroom . She knew that she could not plan everything she would say ; she could only plan how she would begin . It was a matter of letting go in front of the students , and waiting for the light to come . The light would come with images and words she must not hold before class . Her holding them could take away the life they drew from revelation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to show the students . She knew that teaching a poem was like writing a poem : she could only begin , and reach , and wait . If she tried to impose a design to save herself from failure , there would be no revelation on the page , or with her students . Before each class she was afraid , but it was muted , and she knew it kept her from being dull and removed . She loved all of this until her brother was dying , and drawing her to him . Then she felt separated from her work , and had to will herself into her voice , into her very flesh . <p> Grief held her . Always : while she was talking with students , eating with friends , its arms encircled her . Alone , she gave in to it , allowed it to hold her while she fed and cleaned her body , and breathed . It held her when she sat at her desk to do the work that was only for herself ; it pressed her biceps to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could not make a poem grow . She sat with paper and pen , and wrote words , but she felt as she did when she drank coffee and ate toast , that she was only doing this because she was alive , and awake . On weekends she flew to her brother . <p> As she drove to the airport on Fridays and rode to it with her father on Sundays , fear scattered her grief : it lay beside her , hovered behind her . Shards of it stayed in her body ; she could touch the places they pierced in her brain and heart . But fear was in her blood , her muscles , her breath . She heard herself speak to airline clerks . She did not make up anything : she did not look at the eyes , the posture , of other passengers , to find the one whose number was up and visible , or the one who wanted to die by explosion in a crowded plane . She did not imagine the plane 's sudden fall , her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat belt squeezing her double , as she waited for words to utter before the earth she loved tore her apart . She only breathed , and moved onto the plane , always to an aisle seat . <p> The width and height of the aisle held breath and light , and she gazed at it . On her other side were shadow and two people filling two seats , a bulkhead with a dark glass window , an overhead whose curve sealed her . For two hours she flew to the city where her brother was dying . She drank wine , and looked at the aisle . <p> Her brother was dying from love . At first she had watched her parents ' eyes for shame , but she saw only the lights of grief . Mortality had raised him from his secrets ; there was nothing to hide , and he lay whole between clean sheets . It was she who left parts of her behind when she entered the house . Her brother was two years older than she , and he was thin and weak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes anymore . For a long time it had been there , a wet brightness she wanted to consume with her body . He looked at her as though death were a face between them , staring back at him . Sitting on the bed , she bent through death and held her thin brother . Her breasts felt strong and vital , and she wanted to absorb his fear and give him life . She held him as if this were possible . She did not know when fear left him , but it had . Now wit and mischief were in his eyes again , and a new and brighter depth . She did not know what it was . She only knew it was good to see . Sometimes she believed it was simply that : goodness itself , as though death were stripping him of all that was dark and base , mean and vain , not only in him but in the world , too , in its parts that touched his life . <p> So she felt she could tell him now : She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled at her . He said : Fear is a ghost ; embrace your fear , and all you 'll see in your arms is yourself . They could have been sitting at her kitchen table , drinking wine . He could have been saying : Read Tolstoy ; lie in the sun ; make love only with one you love . He had told her that , drinking wine at her table , years ago . She looked at his face on the pillow , wanting to see him as he had seen himself , holding his fear in his arms . She saw her brother dying . <p> On the plane going home , she folded her arms beneath her breasts . Then she closed her eyes , and hugged . She saw herself buckled into the seat , under the tight arc of the plane 's body . She saw the plane in the immense sky , then her brother in bed , poised as she was between the gravity of earth and infinity . She had tried with a poem to know his fear , months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem changed , became one about love , and the only fear in it was hers , of loving again , of her heart swelling to be pierced and emptied . <p> Lightly embracing herself , she saw that , too : the words of the poem coming from her pen , the notebook and her forearms and hands resting on the oak desk her grandmother had used , writing letters . She saw her grandmother , long dead now , writing with a fountain pen . She saw herself sitting in the classroom , at the desk where some afternoons chalk dust lay , and she brushed it off with notepaper so it would not mark the sleeves of her sweater . A trace of someone who had taught before her , who nervously handled chalk . Traces of herself were scattered in the world . She saw the book she had published , held open by hands she would never know . She saw herself holding her last lover , under blankets on a cold night , waking with him to start a day . <p> She liked starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who crowded her kitchen while she cooked . But not starting a day , now that she was alone . She woke from night and dreams to the beginning of nothing . For minutes she lay in bed , gathering her scattered self . Then she rose to work , to be with friends . She liked the touch of leather boots on her canes , soft wool on her arms , snow on her face . <p> She wondered what her brother saw , now that fear had left his eyes . Her grandmother 's eyes were like his , when she was old but not visibly dying : she seemed to watch from a mirthful distance . Perhaps connected to wherever she was going , she still took pleasure in the sport of mortality . Maybe it was a gift , for those who had lived long , and those who were slowly dying . She wanted it while her body was strong , while she was vibrant and pretty . Hugging herself , her eyes closed , she wanted it now as she breathed in this shuddering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid until the plane stopped on the runway . <p> <p> By Andre Dubus <p> Andre Dubus 's most recent book is Broken Vessel published by David Godine , which has just been reissued in paperback . <p>
