VASILI TSIBLIYEV <P> The question " Kto vinovat ? " ( Who 's to blame ? ) has long haunted Russia . Searching for scapegoats  --  be it at the behest of Bolsheviks , Stalinists or the Russian Space Agency  --  is a native tradition . But Vasili Tsibliyev , after surviving the premature judgment of Boris Yeltsin ( who blamed Mir 's woes on " the human factor " ) , has hit the ground fighting . " They can convict me , " he says , " but what 'll they do when the next crisis comes ? " Though the new crew on Mir has been beset by their own troubles , Tsibliyev wo n't gloat . " If the crew were n't prepared , they 'd be on the ground . No one gets a free ride into the cosmos . " <P> Tsibliyev has n't yet seen any medals or pay raises . Since his return , he 's been to Germany twice , but a NASA-sponsored U.S. trip was postponed . " We 've had a few things to sort out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a minor celebrity . Russian Mir watchers praise her dignity and " big-screen beauty . " " She 's kept strong , " says a fellow cosmonaut 's wife , " and kept the kids out of the public eye . " Tsibliyev , a colonel , could still lose his stripes . But son Vasili Jr. , 19 , and daughter Victoria , 14 , are not worried . " Papa 's back , " says Victoria . " That 's all that matters . " <P> ALEXANDER LAZUTKIN <P> When the Soyuz capsule bearing the ill-fated Mir crew hit the Kazakh steppe in mid-August , the landing " was n't as soft as it could have been , " engineer Alexander Lazutkin later recalled . The former gymnast has clearly mastered the art of Right Stuff understatement . In his spartan apartment on the edge of Moscow , Lazutkin speaks of Mir in the most sanguine tones . " The inquisition is over , " he reports , " and so far , no fines . " <P> In the meantime , he is n't worrying about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politburo and KGB bigwigs have done : writing his memoirs . Maybe with the royalties , he 'd be able to move his wife Lyudmilla and daughters Natasha , 13 , and Yevgeniya , 8 , out of the apartment he 's lived in since 1961 . <P> After two weeks of R. and R. on the Black Sea , Lazutkin and Tsibliyev are on tour , hitting six German cities to promote the space program . Despite his ordeal , Lazutkin remembers Mir fondly . " Up there , there 's something worth watching . The earth ... the northern lights . You fly like a bird . And you ca n't fathom how people could possibly walk . " He 'd still love to take another spin onboard . The odds , however , are slim . <P>  --  By Andrew Meier/Moscow
