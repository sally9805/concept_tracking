THE MINISTRIES OF FEAR // AND BEAUTY // Cockermouth and Penrith , 1770  --  1779 // Fair seed-time had my soul , and I grew up // Fostered alike by beauty and by fear .... // ( I.305-6 ) // The earliest picture we have of young Wordsworth is his snapshot of himself as a little noble savage , jumping into the river Derwent behind his home at Cockermouth , in the northwest corner of the English Lake District . He is naked , tan , and alone : the wild child of Cumberland . His only playmates are flowers , and they are violently beaten down . No parents are in sight . // I , a four years ' child , // A naked boy , among the silent pools // Made one long bathing of a summer 's day , // Basked in the sun , or plunged into thy streams , // Alternate , all a summer 's day , or coursed // Over the sandy fields , and dashed the flowers // Of yellow grunsel ; or , when the crag and hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , // Were bronzed with a deep radiance , stood alone // A naked savage in the thunder-shower .... // ( 1799 I.17-26 ) // The river Derwent was a companion who " loved / To blend his murmurs with my nurse 's song , " and Mount Skiddaw was a distant father figure , against whose " lofty height " this rambunctious boy dared to measure himself : at that time , Skiddaw was thought to be the highest mountain in England . // With this kind of writing , begun in 1798 "  --  99 and unmatched since , Wordsworth introduces himself as Nature 's child in the poem " on the growth of my own mind . " Another picture represents his childhood as a " fair seed-time , " " fostered alike by beauty and by fear , " making his growth seem more vegetable than human . In this view he was fostered not by John and Ann Wordsworth but by Fear and Beauty , the primary categories of aesthetic fashion in late eighteenth-century Europe . Fear ( like Skiddaw ) signified the threatening but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derwent ) , the pleasurable feminine feelings associated with home and the Picturesque . The child Wordsworth seems not only at home in nature but at one with it . In later versions he added more human points of reference , to " my father 's house " and , metaphorically , to " my mother 's hut . " But still the dominant impression , as The Prelude ' s narrative begins , is of a child beyond the pale of civilization  --  those " fretful dwellings of mankind " whose troubles , he suggests , the Derwent soothed him not to hear . He heard nature , not other people , not society . // But if we widen our camera 's focus on that naked four-year-old in the river to what stands behind him , what comes gradually into view is the largest , newest ( built 1745 ) , and most splendid house in Cockermouth in 1774 , so large and splendid that it remains unmatched in the town to this day : this was his " father 's house . " Wordsworth 's birthplace was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first floor and plenty of bedrooms for a large family and servants on the second , plus a subterranean ground floor that opened out at the rear to an exquisite long garden running down to the river Derwent . // But it was not truly his " father 's house . " It was the designated residence for the Cockermouth agent of Sir James , the fifth baronet Lowther ( 1736-1802 ) , the most powerful , feared , and hated aristocrat in all of Cumberland and Westmorland . Later known as " the bad Earl " or " gloomy Earl " of Lonsdale , James Lowther was a man so irascible in all his personal dealings , political and domestic , that Thomas Carlyle 's brother believed only his wealth kept him from being committed to a madhouse : " more Detested than any man alive , a Shameless Political Sharper , a Domestick Bashaw , and an Intolerable Tyrant over his Tenants and Dependents . " // John Wordsworth , the poet 's father , was one such tenant and dependent of Lord Lowther , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowther sought to achieve his life 's ambition : political control of Cumberland and Westmorland , where another local nickname for him was " Jimmy Grasp-all . " It is ironic that the man whose name above all is associated with the English Lake District , William Wordsworth , should have been , as a child and young man , one of the many victims of the man above all in the eighteenth century who sought to stamp his name on Cumberland and Westmorland . But James Lowther 's career is much more than mere background to Wordsworth 's poetical life . The facts of his father 's  --  and later his own  --  connections to the house of Lowther are often glossed over , or else the Wordsworths are presented as the innocent victims of Lowther 's villainy . But their relations were much more complicated , so much so that we can leave the " infant babe " Wordsworth to " sleep upon his mother 's breast " for a few years after his birth in 1770 , to devote some attention to his father 's career . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic family , though this slights the claims of the le Flemings , Wordsworth 's eventual landlords at Rydal Mount . But the Lowther-Lonsdales were grander than the Flemings in the late eighteenth century , and were not absentee landlords like their main opponents , the powerful young duke of Portland or the notoriously debauched Charles Howard , earl of Surrey and future duke of Norfolk , who owned Greystoke Castle near Penrith . Lowthers had been leaders in the border wars against Scotland , and today almost every town in Cumberland and Westmorland ( modern Cumbria ) has its Lowther Street or Lonsdale Square , or both . There are very few named after Wordsworth . // James Lowther inherited his uncles ' and grandfather 's political acumen , commercial orientation , and puritanical thriftiness . He had " no opinion of anyone that is not punctual in business , a head not turned to it and that do not look strictly and principally into their own affairs . " " Fussing about in black smalls , silks , buckles , cocked hat , and always with a prodigious nosegay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic character . He did , however , have what was then called his " sentimental " side . According to one tale , he as a young man developed a passion for the daughter of a local farmer and persuaded the father ( one wonders how ) to put the daughter under his protection . " Whilst yet young and beautiful , she died , " the chronicler notes , and the young lord had her  --  or her head  --  embalmed and placed under glass , so that he could visit ( one wonders where ) " this sad memorial of his former happiness . " The story is probably exaggerated , but another one is true and almost as bizarre . When Betsey Lewes , his mistress of twenty-five years , died in 1797 , he kept her body in an open coffin in his London town house for more than seven weeks before suffering her to be buried . But for the most part this gothic cast of his character was submerged beneath an irascible and overbearing temper . He had no patience for the feelings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of his peers or superiors , including his wife , Lady Mary Stuart , though he took care not to offend her father , Lord Bute , prime minister from 1762 to 1763 , and for fifteen years at midcentury the most powerful man in England . // He had hoped for a trade ministry in Lord Bute 's government , to aid his shipping interests in Whitehaven , but he was too unpredictable to be trusted and too temperamental to work with : the king thought his support " scarce worth gaining . " Disappointed in this ambition , he set about establishing personal control over Cumberland and Westmorland , with occasional thrusts into Lancashire and Yorkshire as well . In Westmorland the Lowther interest was returned to Parliament uncontested for over a hundred years , from 1775 to 1880 , except for one year of disputed occupancy of one of the borough seats . // Eighteenth-century English country lords , like those in nineteenth-century Russia , can be classified as those who neglected their lands and tenants , those who milked and oppressed them , and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last category , but his methods smacked of the second , for he was not motivated by any ideology beyond enlightened self-interest . As politicians , most landlords were little interested in public improvements except as they might spin off private advantages ; providing for public welfare in the modern sense was held to be the business of religious institutions and private charity , and education for the poor , in the few places where it was provided , was considered dangerous . The Lowthers resented the public 's envy of their wealth : " ' t is a grievous spirit there is in mankind , to be against anybody 's laying things together though it is for the benefit of the public as well as the particular family . " They were classic liberals in economic theory and practice , and were quite happy to support any profitable investments in " anything going forward in any part of the county to employ the poor and labouring people . " By diversifying his interests from agriculture to mining and trade , James Lowther was in global terms a man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most reactionary man now living would be shocked , if he were to awake some morning in the last decade of the eighteenth century in England , by the oppressiveness of the social atmosphere , " George Harper has written . " The law favored the owners of property , particularly landed property . It was still barbarously severe . The debtor , the poacher , the seditious person , were punished out of all proportion to their offenses , while political corruption and vice in the upper classes were winked at .... There was almost as much reason for a revolt in England as in pre-Revolutionary France . " This was not the light in which the principal actors at the time saw their reality , of course . Life depended on the pursuit of one 's interests through one 's influence . The pursuit of " interests " in politics may sound corrupt to naive modern ears , but in those franker times that was all there was . " All classes , except the lowest , asked or intrigued for places and promotions , for themselves , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most highly placed were the most ruthlessly insistent . " // The story of electoral politics in mid-eighteenth-century England is more diverting than much of its poetry ; even the picaresque novels of Fielding and Smollett are hard-pressed to match it . Hogarth 's comic painting The Country Election looks like no more than social realism to anyone who studies the period closely . A hundred years after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , representative democracy ( so called ) had settled down to a continuation of baronial warfare by other means , principally the buying and selling of votes , a process lubricated with vast amounts of free drinks . This was not quite as corrupt as it sounds , for freeholders who owned the requisite income-producing acreage for enfranchisement could drive hard bargains with large landowners to deliver their votes . // The main reason to seek control of a large number of parliamentary seats in eighteenth-century England was not party loyalty , still less national policy . Both of these more modern reasons entered in from time to time , but the real reason was simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's affairs go on with great ease and quietness . " So said another of Lowther 's agents , when urging him to extend his influence by taking over the Cockermouth seat . Lowther took over Cockermouth in 1756 by his characteristically direct method of buying up almost all ( 134 , to be exact ) the burgage rents in town  --  narrow strips of property whose title deeds carried ancient voting rights  --  at the astronomical cost of ? 58,000 ( over ? 500,000 , in modern terms ) , including Wordsworth 's future birthplace . Lowther 's land buying was " not so much investing money ... as buying up the perquisites of a social class , the undisturbed control of the life of a neighborhood . " He very probably owned the Derwent 's " sandy fields " with their " yellow grunsel " that Wordsworth played in , and many a neighboring " crag , " " hill , " and " wood " as well , if not Skiddaw 's " lofty height " itself . // John Wordsworth 's life was devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wordsworth family , filtered through their father . Lowther consumed people who could not stand up to him , and so he did his steward , John Wordsworth . When Wordsworth later participated in the French Revolution and the English radical reform movement , he had the hated features of James Lowther somewhere in his mind 's eye , giving feudal tyranny a local habitation and a name . // John Wordsworth Sr. was Lowther 's law or land agent . In the late twentieth century this sounds like the steward or overseer of an estate . But in the mid-eighteenth century it signified mainly a political business agent , or nonstop campaign manager , comprising the tasks of borough monger , ward heeler , vote canvasser , election rigger , briber , and payer-off of innkeepers  --  none of which were regarded as reprehensible or , within reason , illegal activities . Such agents were not popular , since they tended to treat people as their master treated them . With an employer like this , and with enormous responsibilities in record keeping , rent collecting , and vote delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's house was frequently one of the most " fretful dwellings of mankind . " In this service John Wordsworth was expected to keep scrupulous accounts and give accurate advice and intelligence . In addition to dealing with innkeepers , he might also be expected to spread rumors , forge documents , manipulate opinion , and abuse the trust of his public offices to further the interests of his employer . All this would be considered " honest " behavior , where the standard of honesty was loyalty to one 's employer , not necessarily public morality . One of John Wordsworth 's letters gives the gist of this field lieutenant 's reports to his general : // At Grey southern an election district Lord Egremont 's people have not been able to stir a Jot . They could not even get a hand to the Petition for Leave to carry in the Bill ; so that this matter is over for the present session . I have not yet received the article for the purchase of Mrs. Tiffin 's Royalties in Grey southern but shall have it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I hope to hear from Mr. Garforth very soon in relation to Mr. Gilfred 's rights at another town , and am Sir your most obt &amp; most hble servant . // The freeholders of Westmorland and Cumberland fiercely resisted Lowther 's efforts to acquire total command of the two counties , especially during the three decades of William Wordsworth 's birth and growth , and his estrangement from and return to his native country . Lowther 's political ambitions were not an abstract historical process for him , but one in which his father was a principal actor who paid a high price for his actions in local unpopularity . By simultaneously associating young Wordsworth with the dominant social power in his home region , while alienating him from its popular base , James Lowther determined much of poet 's wandering life during the formative years of his manhood . But young Wordsworth was not a natural rebel : both prior to and immediately following this twenty-year period , he and his family unhesitatingly allied themselves with the Lowther interest and worked actively for it . Thus Dorothy Wordsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tyrants , " would before she was fifty stoutly maintain , " For my Part I wish not success to any opposers of the House of Lonsdale ; for the side that house takes is the good side . " // John Wordsworth was far from being Lowther 's only agent , and the " estate " he oversaw was not Sir James 's personal residence at Lowther Castle near Penrith . He held forth at Cockermouth , where his job was to gain control of as much land as he could buy , rent , steal , or lay claim to through nonstop lawsuits against Lowther 's rival landowners ; elections were simply another strategy in the game . Cockermouth was one of the three " urban " boroughs in the two counties , along with Carlisle and Appleby . Each had two seats in Parliament , which , along with the two county boroughs themselves , made a regional total of ten . Cockermouth and Appleby were both " pocket " and thoroughly " rotten " boroughs , much less populous than unrepresented urban centers like Kendal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cockermouth consisted of one road enclosed between the Derwent and a wall , with access to the countryside through gates at either end of the street . For the twenty years of his tenure at Cockermouth ( 1764-83 ) , John Wordsworth was active in Lowther 's successful campaign to extend his parliamentary interest to all ten seats . This was the period from Lowther 's greatest debacle , the infamous election of 1768 , to the time of his greatest triumph , the election of 1784 , when his interest helped the younger Pitt to an ascendancy that lasted nearly twenty years . For his help , Lowther was rewarded by being created the first earl of Lonsdale . When Lowther initially took up the seat for Cumberland , in 1757 , following the deaths of his father and two uncles in rapid succession that made him ( in the prime minister 's estimate to George III ) " perhaps the richest subject that His Majesty has , " the family held only one seat in Parliament . But during the next twenty-odd years , thanks to the hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as nine of the region 's seats . Seven was his more usual number , which he supplemented by buying two seats in Surrey ( at Haslemere ) on speculation . In one combination or another , these nine seats were known as " Sir James 's Ninepins. " // John Wordsworth had difficulty in bending himself to Lowther 's rod , and he was not nearly strong enough to stand up against it . He worried that his terms of office  --  defined as agent and bailiff  --  had not been spelled out clearly enough regarding salary and expenses . He pleaded with his cousin Captain Hugh Robinson to intervene for him , because nothing had been settled though he had been in Cockermouth nine months . " I really hope Sir James will have no such thoughts as those of deferring the main business any longer . " His fears were well founded , but he did not have  --  being only nineteen at the time  --  the foresight or courage to make his employer sign a contract of obligations . // But John Wordsworth was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a willing and expert player in the game . He was a practicing attorney " in the way of acquiring a fortune . " He " took into his keeping most of the estates Sir James Lowther purchased for his election purposes , " and his own account book was titled " Rental of Lands and Schedule of Real and Personal Securities belonging to Mr. Wordsworth . " Its " General Index " charts the steady growth of what would have been the young Wordsworth 's inheritance ; it shows that John Wordsworth owned nearly twenty parcels of property throughout the district , from a seventy-acre farm at Sockbridge to individual crofts and barns dotted across the countryside , which produced more than ? 100 a year in rents . In addition , he had smaller investments like cattle gates , which controlled livestock 's access to pasturage ; these might return only a pound a year , or less , but they added up : on the High Moor , he and Lowther were the two biggest owners , holding more than a third of fifty-six such gates between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also held a 1/32 interest in the brigantine " Welcome " out of Maryport . // Agents like John Wordsworth were less salaried employees than junior partners in an entrepreneurial business in which elections were only one of the variables to be monitored and controlled as best one could , like the weather and the price of labor . It was expected that agents would often lay out their own money for bribes , retainers , and other kinds of payments , in expectation of remuneration by their lord , but also in anticipation of other sorts of returns on such investments : offices , favors , rents , and other quid pro quo that they could hold as their own , with or without their employer 's knowledge . The great lords both dispersed and disguised their power by investing it in the hands of their underlings through the distribution of " loaves and fishes , " as the spoils or " harvests " of office were then genially known : a whole host of minor offices of little power or remuneration but of great usefulness whenever land or water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and timbering ventures . There were sheriffs , coroners , distributorships , seigneuries , customs and port officers , and so on . Sometimes the fees charged by these offices were paltry sums , but they could be administered on an ad hoc basis according to what the official thought he could get away with . In the same year of 1774 when Wordsworth remembered himself as Nature 's savage child , his father was made coroner of the seigneury of Millom , a little office for a large stretch of seacoast running from the mouth of the Duddon almost to the mouth of the Derwent , and he also held the semi-official title of " Steward of Ennerdale. " // Active landlords like the Lowthers aided the independent business interests of trusted stewards by way of loans , partnerships , and political influence . John Spedding , whose son was one of William Wordsworth 's best friends , rose from an impoverished orphan serving-boy to the lesser ranks of the Cumberland gentry . John Wordsworth , starting out from a social position close to where Spedding ended , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to rise to a proportionately higher rank . Such professional inheritances had ample precedent : Wordsworths had long worked in the Lowther interest . Wordsworth 's paternal grandfather , Richard , had first come to Westmorland from South Yorkshire in 1700 , to recoup his fortunes with the then baron Lonsdale , having been done out of his fortune by his own guardian 's chicanery , which left him landless among a host of rich and influential Wordsworths . He was agent for James Lowther 's father 's Westmorland estates from 1728 until his death , during which time he was clerk of the peace , mayor of Appleby , and receiver general of Westmorland . He left the position of estate steward in 1738 , but this was a mere technicality , for loyalty and service to one 's patron carried over into the government posts . This Richard Wordsworth particularly distinguished himself for loyalty in 1745 , when he personally spirited away the county monies to Patterdale to protect them from the invading Jacobite armies of Bonnie Prince Charlie , while his wife , Wordsworth 's grandmother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Lord Lowther was less equal to the situation , dying of a heart attack shortly afterward , purportedly from the shock of seeing the rebel army march across his lands . ) John Wordsworth took over some of his father 's responsibilities immediately upon his death in 1760 , when John was only nineteen years old . This is four years earlier than has usually been thought , and four years before his removal to Cockermouth , when he was already busily requesting " the goodness of your vote " for the Lowther interest . // The poet 's uncle Richard ( 1733  --  1794 ) , who was disinherited from the family 's small estate at Sockbridge in favor of John Wordsworth Sr. for marrying against his father 's wishes , was named collector of customs at Whitehaven , Cumberland 's major seaport . Whitehaven was at the time second only to London in tonnage of materials that passed in and out of its harbor , thanks largely to vast increases in profitable trade from North America , especially in Virginia tobacco . It was , with Kendal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same size as Nottingham or Leeds . If James Lowther bought Cockermouth , it is not too much to say that he and his brothers and their agent Richard Wordsworth made Whitehaven , since they laid out its streets on a plan ( apparently never paid for ) prepared by the great architect and planner Robert Adam , and improved its harbor by way of improving their trading business , in one of the earliest examples of centralized town planning in England . // But the most successful of all the Wordsworth-related clan was John ( " Jack " ) Robinson , John Wordsworth 's first cousin and son of another Appleby mayor , who also started out as a Lowther agent , and was " qualified " for Parliament in 1764 by Lowther 's investing in him the money necessary to make him a man of ? 2,000 a year , the minimum financial requirement . Though some aristocrats considered it degrading to send their agent or man of business to Parliament , Lowther did not show this kind of snobbery , and Robinson held the ultra-safe Appleby seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of the rights of the American colonists . ( Lowther was sympathetic to them , and made a motion in Parliament opposing the use of Hanoverian troops against them . ) Robinson then joined Lord North 's administration , moved to the seat for Harwich , and soon became treasury secretary and the government 's leading polltaker , political strategist , and paymaster . Lowther never forgave him . // Many elements of Lowther 's policy and personality , and John Wordsworth 's role in furthering the one and suffering the other , came out illuminatingly in the election of 1768 , a Pyrrhic victory that made the names of Lowther and Wordsworth hated for years to come . Next to the Oxford election of the same year , the Carlisle and Cumberland elections of 1768 are reckoned the most sensational of the century by parliamentary historians . Wordsworth 's father was very active in the Cumberland contest , and what Lowther 's uncle said of his agent John Spedding could as well have been said of John Wordsworth : " it is notorious in the country that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run candidates for both of the Cumberland county seats , thereby upsetting the agreed-upon balance of power between his family and the Howards , that each should have one of the two seats . Usually seats were disposed of by aristocrats casting lots , so as to avoid the tremendous cost in bribes and " entertainments " of a contested election . ( " Contested " did not mean " disputed , " but literally an election in which there was a choice between two or more candidates . ) Contests were the exception rather than the rule , on a principle enunciated by James Lowther 's great-grandfather : " The first thing that contributes to a national settlement must be unanimity in elections . " One item in John Wordsworth 's hand from this election reads , " Lent freemen in notes ? 680 which after they were polled were ordered to be cancelled . " Did Wordsworth 's father doublecross the freemen , or did the freemen vote otherwise than they were supposed to ? And in 1772 , four years after the election and two after Wordsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innkeeper at Cockermouth , applied to Lowther for payment of " her Election Bills , " the hefty sum of ? 500 , of which only ? 181 had been paid since the election . Mrs. Perle had " applied to Mr. Wordsworth about two years ago for more money , and that she found from his answer that she had no expectation of any payment from him , and as he then told her that all the Cockermouth bills were then before Lowther , she has waited since that time without giving any further trouble , in hopes of hearing from some of your agents . " Her friends would n't have bothered Lowther " about a matter of this nature " if they had n't been solicited by her friends from Lorton , who frequented her house , " and as they served you at the Election , notwithstanding they are Tenants to Lord Egremont . " Lowther would get the point of this thinly veiled threat of political defection. // Not everything was so venal in this operation , however . Sometimes votes were bought outright , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : not because it was illegal and immoral , but because it inflated prices on the election markets . In addition to the deals made before elections for favors in exchange for votes , there was the much livelier business of the " canvass " of votes , a euphemism for the punch , pies , and tobacco provided free throughout the polling period , which could run as long as two weeks . By far the largest item in all the money handled by John Wordsworth and other election agents was for paying publicans who kept their inns open for drinks on the house , it being well understood which inns stood open for the supporters of which candidate or party . Jack Robinson 's account to Lowther for his first election in 1757 gives the flavor  --  or flavors  --  of these festivities : // There are 7 houses fixed for the entertainment of your friends , viz. the Globe , Mr. Dixon 's , unlimited , the House late John Lucock 's , Ordinarys 130  --  Wine 10 Dozen . Punch and ale proportionable  --  Two others at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wine , and punch and ale , and the other punch and ale proportionable .... It is proposed also to have 13 other houses , for taking off the lower class as much as may from the better houses ... besides likewise some ale from the other houses for the mob . These means it is hoped may lessen the expense at the great houses where it used to run high by the rabble getting in and stealing and carrying off all the liquor they could .... // And all this was for an uncontested by-election for one seat , which had been held successively during the three preceding years by the candidate 's uncles ! // " Punch and ale proportionable " was the working slogan , whatever the more serious issues might be , in these elections that would make a Chicago alderman blush . The election of 1768 has been reckoned to have cost nearly ? 100,000 pounds , mainly in this kind of expenditures . More cautious estimates put the figure at " only " ? 30,000 , but since John Wordsworth 's records alone show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chiefly for innkeepers ' bills , they suggest that the higher estimates may not be excessive . All in all , approximately ten thousand votes were cast in the five boroughs , an exceptionally high number due to the artificial inflation of the voter rolls , which proved the proverbial wisdom of avoiding election contests to avoid costs . // But Lowther 's victory was challenged in Parliament by the duke of Portland , who was able to prove that the Cockermouth sheriff , Giles Lawson , had improperly canceled votes for his opponent , Portland 's man , Henry Curwen , one of Lowther 's competitors in the coal-mining business . Lowther 's defense was prepared by John Wordsworth , who set about a counterattack , claiming that Portland 's other candidate , Henry Fletcher , had " paid the Bills of the Innkeepers after the Election " and bought votes in exchange for reduced tithes for some of his tenants  --  who readily acknowledged they would not have voted for him otherwise . Many MPs had a hard time keeping a straight face when such normal practices were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the verdict , which turned solely on Sheriff Lawson 's inconsistently allowing some voters to participate in the poll while forbidding others . Sometime during the proceedings , the Wordsworth house in Cockermouth was searched by officers , but they found nothing incriminating . Nonetheless , Lowther lost his Cumberland seat , with no kind thoughts for the agent who had prepared his unsuccessful defense . Lowther himself was not greatly incommoded by losing his seat , for he served out the rest of the term simply by switching over to his safe Cockermouth seat . But this setback may have cost John Wordsworth his own parliamentary career , since in the election of 1780 Lowther put another of his agents , John Garforth , into the Cockermouth seat . // There may have been costs  --  or perhaps benefits  --  for the Wordsworth family from the other side as well , as we shall see in 1799 , when the secret accounts book of the duke of Portland  --  then home secretary , in charge of domestic security and espionage  --  records a payment of nearly ? 100 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonist 's chief agent in this cause c ? l ? bre . // The land disputes and election of 1768 were the most notorious events in Cumberland for many a year , though the major participants in this skirmish of their " ten years war " settled it amicably enough . An altogether typical compromise was worked out whereby the Lowther and Portland interests agreed again to divide the two Cumberland seats between them , so there would be no more contested elections . But for the population at large feelings were let loose that did not disappear for many years . A pamphlet war of squibs and cartoons ran for years , portraying Lowther as the great Satan incarnate ( see illustration ) , and his minions as fools and traitors . // Oh ! where is gone that country 's love , // Which once our race inspir 'd , // That stoopt to tyrant L-w  --   --  -r 's nod sic , // My honest soul hath fir'd. // Villain repent , repent thy late , // Thy black and partial deeds ; // Eternal shame hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Giles Lawson was regarded as a well-meaning though incompetent fool , but if the sheriff of Cockermouth could be painted with this kind of ridicule , we can be sure that Lowther 's main agent in the district , John Wordsworth  --  no fool  --  was regarded with less good-humored distaste . When his son at age twenty-five penned ( but did not publish ) a satire on the English aristocracy that asked , " Must honour then to Lonsdale 's tail be bound ? , " he was remembering the shame he felt as a child for the violations of his father 's honor that employment in Lowther 's service brought with it . // We can only guess at the effect all this power brokering and borough mongering had on Wordsworth as a small child , but he would have been conscious of it by the time he was four or five , given his preternatural ability to recall sensations from early childhood .

" By age fifteen , when she wrote this letter , she had come to the disillusioned realization that " all those who visited ... my father 's house " had done so only because of their father 's identification with Lowther . On another occasion she speculated , " My uncle Kit ... having always espoused the Cause of the Duke of Norfolk , has incensed him Lowther so much that I fear we shall feel through life the effects of his imprudence . " This , plus the defection of Wordsworth 's cousin Jack Robinson to the opposition , did indeed work against the Wordsworth children 's interest .

They were not proud of their daughter 's ( Wordsworth 's grandmother ) marriage alliance with the Cookson family , who were " in trade , " and they ignored the Wordsworth connection completely when they compiled their family tree . // ( Continues ... )
