Whether your market stance is bullish , bearish or sheepish , pause for a moment to tot up your portfolio 's ball-park return since MONEY published its 1994 roster of 10 All Star brokers and their top stocks a year ago . Here 's a crib sheet  --  and a crying towel . Investors in U.S. stock funds have earned a scant 0.6% as a group . Holders of seemingly stodgy government bond funds lost 4% as yields on 30-year Treasuries , mirroring Federal Reserve rate hikes , spiked two percentage points to more than 8% . And our All Stars ? Their 30 picks and pans gained an awesome 16% , on average , vs. a 1% rise in the S &P; 500 index . If that 16% profit puts yours to shame , you have an added incentive to check out the advice of our 1995 All Stars . Our new team of accomplished brokers sports one new member plus nine repeaters from ' 94 ( their reward for outperforming the S &P; 500 ) . Pacing our nine market beaters was Paine Webber 's Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omitted ) Trilling , a 25-year veteran based in Los Angeles , scored not only a 43% average profit but last year 's biggest gain as well  --  a 111% rise for Special Devices , a $58 million ( annual sales ) maker of gizmos in auto air bags . Other highlights of the ' 94 season : * Best in the West . Our top three stock pickers all reside in western states . This talent pool does n't surprise Trilling . " We 've all been burned by Wall Street hypesters over the years , " he explains . " So out West , we tend to develop our own sources as well as a healthy skepticism of hot stocks . " * Spence 's winning streak . The gifted stock picking of Steven Spence , a 23-year veteran of Paine Webber in Portland , Ore. , has earned him a slot on each of the five All Star squads we 've fielded since 1988 . How did he do in ' 94 ? He placed second , with a 33% profit . Since ' 88 , Spence 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14%. * Do n't count your chickens . Peter Slocum of A.G. Edwards in Carefree , Ariz. , No. 3 with a 25% profit , named as his top ' 94 pick WLR Foods , an obscure $617 million poultry producer selling for $20 a share . By March the stock was up 60% to $32 following a $330 million buy-out bid by $4.7 billion chicken czar Tyson Foods . Alas , WLR 's board thwarted Tyson 's offer , plunging the stock back to $21 , a mere 7% gain . Moral : Take the money once a takeover bid is on the table . In choosing our A-Team , we sought referrals from money managers and brokerage executives , who were asked to nominate exemplars at firms other than their own . To be considered , candidates had to take new accounts of $150,000 or less and to have a squeaky clean record of professional conduct according to the National Association of Securities Dealers , the best source of disciplinary actions taken against brokers . We then focused on the key attributes of accountability and independent thinking that set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Base their recommendations on their own research as well as that of analysts . * Personally own the stocks that are on their buy lists  --  a show of confidence increasingly rare among brokers . * Avoid selling most brokerage products whose fat sales and management fees can weigh down customers ' returns . * Give regular customers commission discounts of 20% to 25% in many cases . The following All Star bios appear in order of the broker 's average gain over a recent 10-month season . They feature his or her ' 95 market outlook ; three are bullish ( down from six in ' 94 ) , six are anxious ( vs. three ) and one bearish ( Steve Spence both years ) . Each offers three recommendations capable of beating the S &P; 500 in ' 95 . Their picks also figure to deliver earnings growth  --  the best proxy of a stock 's potential appreciation  --  averaging a heady 38% next year . That 's triple the 12% rise forecast for the companies in the S &P; 500 . Yet the All Stars ' picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings multiple , recently 15 based on most analysts ' projections for ' 95 .

And buy $475 million recorded music wholesaler Alliance Entertainment ( CDS , New York Stock Exchange , lately $5.50 ) .

Pan : Sell short $28 million Positive Response Television ( PRTV , OTC , $17 ) , creator of infomercials for $40 Super Slicers and other impulse purchases hawked on air by chairman Mike Levey .

Picks : Buy $240 million Rawlings Sporting Goods ( RAWL , OTC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basketballs ( and related gear ) that went public in July at $12 .
