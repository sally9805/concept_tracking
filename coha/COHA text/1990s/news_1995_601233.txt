<p> The employees are all smiling in United Airlines ' ads touting the nation 's largest company majority-owned by employees . And they have reason to : UAL , the parent , is expected to make more money this year than it has since 1989 . UAL 's stock is up more than 60% since Jan. 1 . CEO Gerald Greenwald told shareholders recently that the rising stock is evidence United is " on the right course . " <p> But his optimism is n't universally shared by UAL 's 80,000 employees one year after they gained control of 55% of the company . Instead of creating a model of corporate harmony , the complex deal has triggered employee protests , a class-action lawsuit and an FBI investigation . One common complaint is that employees did n't get a fair deal . They insist they were misled or ill-informed about the deal 's particulars by union leaders and advisers - advisers who were awarded $ 45 million in fees from UAL after the deal went through . <p> Greenwald refused repeated requests for an interview . But other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and that most workers support it . <p> " United 's performance and our employees ' dedication have made United a turnaround story . . . ( It 's ) the largest and the most successful venture of its kind in the nation 's business history , " UAL spokesman John Kiker says . <p> Still , there are signs of disharmony :  --  Armed with documents supplied by some United pilots , the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into whether some pilots union advisers engaged in conflicts of interest when the deal was being negotiated . They allegedly did n't tell the rank and file and the union 's governing board about the " success fees " they were in position to receive from United . ( Related story , above . ) Under the Railway Labor Act , which also covers airlines , union officials or agents are prohibited from accepting company funds in exchange for influencing collective bargaining decisions .  --  In April , three employees - pilots Jerry Summers and Scott Lewis and mechanic Laurie Stanton - filed a class-action civil lawsuit in Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in the company . The lawsuit seeks to recoup $ 1 billion from State Street Bank &; Trust of Boston , the trustee for United 's employee stock ownership plan , or ESOP . Union advisers retained State Street to conduct an independent evaluation of the fairness of the transaction . The lawsuit alleges State Street acted as a " rubber stamp ( for the company and the union advisers ) by passively accepting aspects of the transaction highly unfavorable to the employees . " State Street has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit , stating it had " no role in the business decisions that structured the overall transaction . " <p> Eugene Keilin , the investment banker who acted as the lead financial adviser for the pilots union , anticipated concerns about the deal 's financial fairness at a May 21 , 1994 , meeting with union leaders . <p> " This is not a good transaction from a financial standpoint . I can not recommend this as an investment , " he said , according to several pilots who attended . In an interview , Keilin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he says he continued to recommend the transaction because employees stood to gain seats on the board , new management ( including Greenwald ) and greater job security . In exchange for wage concessions , employees receive UAL stock through the company 's ESOP . Keilin says advisers got the best deal they could from a company threatening , at the time , to cut routes and thousands of jobs .  --  In recent weeks , United flight attendants have staged protest rallies at every major U.S. airport where United flies , passing out handbills criticizing the company to passengers in Washington , Los Angeles , Denver and Chicago . The protests are directed against the company 's plan to open additional flight attendant bases overseas and hire more lower-paid foreign workers . The 17,000-member flight attendants union refused to participate in the employee buyout . Although the buyout constituted a collective bargaining agreement , only one fifth of UAL 's employees were given a chance to vote on it . ( That , however , is not atypical of how employee groups at United have made major decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision for 8,000-plus United pilots . Only the machinists union 's rank and file were given a chance to vote .  --  Police were called twice recently to break up fights at United 's maintenance base in San Francisco . In a May 1 incident , a mechanic hit a co-worker on the head with a bottle . In an earlier incident , one mechanic attacked another with a power screwdriver . Mechanics attribute those and other outbreaks to the growing split between employees who support the transaction and those opposed , as well as tension over UAL 's future . <p> " Everyone is upset , stressed out . Tempers are running high , " says Los Angeles mechanic Larry Martel . <p> The depth of the mechanics ' anger was measured in last December 's vote over what union would represent them . The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - the current union whose leaders had supported the deal - won by 559 votes out of 12,405 cast . An upstart union that had pledged to try to undo the deal drew 48% of the vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Mechanic , to rival the IAM 's publication . One feature called the Employee Stock Ownership Toilet provides a running tally on how much in wage concessions employees have " flushed down the toilet . " <p> The employee buyout was supposed to be based on labor-management cooperation . United pilots were expected to work closely with management on task forces to improve operations and to develop policies on matters such as fuel conservation , crew scheduling and travel privileges . <p> In February , however , the pilots union threatened to yank representatives from all task forces . It cited " the lack of any meaningful change within the company since the ESOP began , " according to a Feb. 9 memo that some union leaders sent to all United pilots . Pilots were disappointed that many of the middle managers that they had been at odds with for years had kept their jobs . The pilots , the memo suggests , felt Greenwald and senior managers were n't listening to their suggestions . <p> Greenwald managed to defuse the situation , the memo says , by hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if word of their dissent leaked out , " Wall Street ( would ) sour on UAL " and the stock would fall . <p> Since February , the pilots have been " deeply involved in the decision-making process , " according to Harlow B. Osteboe , the pilots union chairman and a member of UAL 's board . Union representatives have even been meeting with United managers in the company boardroom . <p> Details of the deal <p> Employees bought 55% of UAL in exchange for $ 4.9 billion in pay cuts and new work rules over six years . They also got job security - UAL ca n't lay off pilots or mechanics for those six years - and three seats on UAL 's board . The deal cut United 's labor costs without eliminating thousands of jobs , as American Airlines , Delta and USAir have done . <p> Employees took pay cuts of 8.25% to 15.7% and their wages will be frozen for at least three years . In exchange for the pay cuts , the employees each year get shares of stock that are held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . The number of shares depends on what employee group they belong to , and their salary . Pilots - because their pay was cut the most - get the most stock . Pilots make up to $ 175,000 a year . <p> Not all employees are convinced they 've gotten a good deal . Honolulu-based mechanic Joseph Prisco , who took an 8.25% pay cut , says he now brings home $ 250 less a month . He and his 11-year-old son had to move out of their two-bedroom townhouse and into a two-bedroom apartment in a less-desirable neighborhood . <p> " Everything is a lot smaller in the new place . The schools in the neighborhood are n't as good . My son keeps asking me , ' Why did we have to move ? ' " Prisco says . <p> Prisco grew more disenchanted when he received a financial statement recently from UAL , showing how much he has contributed in wage concessions for stock . The statement showed Prisco contributed $ 5,005.87 for 29.36 UAL shares . That means , he , like the other employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stock that closed Tuesday at $ 147 3/4 and has been as low as $ 115 in recent weeks . <p> Officials at UAL and the pilots and machinists unions do n't dispute that employees are paying about $ 170 a share - about $ 40 more than UAL 's price on July 12 , 1994 , the day UAL shareholders approved the transaction . They say workers are paying a premium for gaining control of the company . <p> " We did n't just buy shares . We bought control , " says Robert Stine , communications director for IAM Local 1781 , which represents the bulk of United 's mechanics . Stine says employees should n't focus on what the stock is trading at today . What 's important , he says , is what the stock is worth when they retire or leave UAL . <p> Corey Rosen , director of the non-profit National Center for Employee Ownership , says UAL employees - in view of the stock 's recent appreciation and UAL 's prospects - are making out just fine . <p> " With the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year as United employees did , " Rosen says . <p> Debating the future <p> Wright B. George is a pilot leader who initially opposed the buyout but now supports it . He believes United 's stock will increase in value as Wall Street becomes convinced " the inmates are n't running the asylum . " If the stock rises , he predicts , employee criticism of the deal will evaporate . <p> Greenwald has spent the last few weeks telling financial analysts that cost savings from the labor concessions and the ESOP 's tax benefits are helping United financially . In the first quarter , UAL had $ 3 million in net income . It had a loss of $ 97 million in 1994 's first quarter . Wall Street airline analysts estimate UAL 's net income for the 1995 first half , including a non-cash charge of $ 200 million for the employee ESOP , at $ 79 million vs. a loss of $ 35 million last year . <p> Sick-leave rates dropped an average 12% from March through May . United 's standing in some passenger service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-time record in April , up from ninth in April 1994 . But those arguments do n't sit well with Robert Fisher , a mechanic at Dulles International Airport outside Washington , D.C. Fisher says United is still finding ways to contract out work , such as the maintenance of the interior electronics on the new Boeing 777 jets . <p> " We did n't get job security , we just got a pay cut , " Fisher complains . Because his paycheck is down more than $ 200 a month , he says , his wife has taken a job cleaning houses from 8 a.m. until noon each day . She previously stayed home with their younger two children , who are hearing-impaired . Now , she arrives home just in time for him to leave for the afternoon shift at Dulles . " I do n't know what we 'll do if my shift ever changes , " Fisher says . <p> Fisher voted against the ESOP . Like many mechanics , he complains that employees were n't given enough specifics about how the ESOP would work before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what some employees say were significant ways after pilots union leaders and machinists union members voted on it in January 1994 . ( Related story , below . ) And , in May , union leaders agreed to a company demand not to let employees take another vote , despite the revisions . <p> Union officials do n't dispute that the employees had only general , and in some cases , hypothetical information . They say they could n't give the employees any more specifics because the transaction 's structure was evolving until a month before the shareholder vote in July . <p> " They were advised nobody could state how much the transaction would cost them per share , " says Ken Thiede , president of District 141 , the United chapter of the IAM . " We told them it would all depend on how many people ultimately were involved , whether the flight attendants joined the buyout , whether the IAM ranks would grow or shrink , " Thiede says . <p> Fisher , who is 31 , says he stays up nights worrying about what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is my retirement they 're betting with , " he says . " This is n't the lottery . Nothing would make me feel better than if they gave me my money back and kept their stock .
