It is not yet dawn in the highlands of Kenya , but already the woman , Ukali , is walking the road that winds up Ol Doinyo Sabuk . She is wearing her heavy coat with the Lamu , brass buttons , turning her fingers around them like they are tiny knobs on a secret door , like she is trying to find a way back inside her own heart . <p> Ukali is thinking about her son , Mathu , nineteen . Two weeks ago he had his way with a girl he hardly knew , and perhaps no one would have ever known , except this girl , only fourteen and fresh from giving birth , began to bleed . They were in the grasses not far from St. Kizito School and her blood ran out in thin , twisting rivers , so many rivers Mathu ran away , leaving the girl to die . That is the part Ukali can not understand , the thing that has stolen her gladness at being Mathu 's mother . She does not know who this boy is anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old village on the slope of the mountain to the place she buried Mathu 's birth cord . She wants to remember him small and blameless , to find her mother 's heart again . <p> *** <p> When her son graduated from St. Kizito , she thought he would go on to the University of Nairobi , become a teacher , even find a government position . Instead he took up his father 's business , a touring company in Thika  --  Ivory Safaris Limited . Her husband , Owino , owned a whole fleet of zebra-stripped vans which took Americans on photographic and game-viewing trips into Amboseli , Samburu , Tsavo and the Aberdares . But it is no secret from Ukali that most of their money , the money that bought her coat with the fine Lamu buttons , came from tusks sold on the black market and even rhino horn when the elephants were scarce . Her son was becoming an expert in killing animals by night , and she does not know what this has to do with the dead girl , but in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify . <p> At night Ukali dreams of the girl . She never appears as her actual self , however . Ukali simply knows it is she in that odd way you know things in dreams . One time the girl was a dung beetle scurrying across the floor . In another dream she was an elephant , lying slaughtered and missing her tusks . Last night the girl was the legless woman who lives in a cardboard box near Kabau and they were all spitting on her  --  Mathu , Owino , even herself . <p> Ukali has asked Owino a dozen times how their son could have done this and his answer is always the same . He says Mathu did not know the girl had given birth a week ago , that he was too ashamed to go for help , that he did not know how serious it all was . Once Owino told her , " Stop fretting . Mathu did not mean to hurt the girl . Besides , she was nothing much . She was just a village girl and not even a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air was dark and laced with mist , but now light breaks suddenly across the hump of the mountain , streaking pale blue , striking Ukali 's face , glazing it ink-gold . For a moment she forgets about her son and stares a little dazed at the top of Ol Doinyo Sabuk , the Sleeping Buffalo . <p> It is said that long ago before the mountain there was a young chief who had no mother to soften his heart . He killed a buffalo calf and when its mother came after him , he changed her into a mountain . Into Ol Doinyo Sabuk . It is also said one day the mother buffalo will wake up and when she does , the earth will shake with her fury . And even now Ukali can see vapors rising like smoke along her back . <p> She crosses the bridge over the Athi River , taking the high road that will lead her to the outskirts of her old village . The road is deserted . She no longer believes in spirits , but still she looks behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savannas are lit pink . It makes her think of the grasses where the girl 's body was found . She can not say what possessed her to do it , but she went to see the place for herself . The grass was pressed down and stained . She could make out plainly where the curve of the girl 's back had been , how she drew herself into a tiny sickle . <p> She saw the girl 's mother that same day , her face like a slice of darkness shining through the slit of a shawl , jeweled with flies she did not bother to brush away . Once when Ukali stood on her porch , she thought she saw the woman crouched like a green shadow among the trees . Now walking along , she begins to see the woman again in that same half-glimpsed way . <p> The old ones from her village used to say a person , if they had reason enough , could change into a hyena or any sort of thing and Ukali knew this to be plain silliness , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egret floating in the eye of the volcano lake down the escarpment . It lifts off the water and flies up the mountain , skimming the air over her head , screaming at her as if it knows . <p> When she passes the Indian duka , even one of the Sikhs , wearing a turban like a beehive of gauze , seems to be the girl 's mother . <p> He calls to her . " You are looking for tea and biscuits , yes ? Come in . " He gestures to the doorway and Ukali , suddenly panicked , breaks into a run , hurling herself straight uphill . She runs until her lungs throb . <p> As a child , when she was scared , when her father stayed away too long drinking and her mother sent her to bring him home , she would repeat things as fast as she could-tongue twisters , missionary verses , things her mother said  --  saying them so fast there was not a crevice for fear to slip in . And this is what she does the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , " she says . " The girl was nothing much . She was just a village girl . And not even a good one . " <p> Finally she is calm again . She sets her mind on Mathu small and blameless . She remembers the day he was born . It was the dry season , in a storm without rain . The dust swept down in torrents and when the brown veil stopped beating , Ukali and her sister took the cord and membranes and knelt under the acacias , poking fun at the twisted coil , how it smelled like decaying mangoes . It was so slick with juices it wriggled from her hand onto the ground and her sister in her green kitengi , her scarf wound into a bright python on her head , hopped in a circle , shrieking " Nyoka ! Snake . " <p> That day the earth was dry and hard-caked . Ukali could barely scratch the surface with her digging stick . All her strength had gone into pushing Mathu out . Her sister took the stick and chiseled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Ukali laid the cord " and they fell on the mountain laughing . <p> Ukali heaped the dirt over the afterbirth and said the thing her mother and her grandmothers had said when they knelt in this same place , " The cord is cut , but the connection will not be broken . " She marked the place with a stone . They rose to their feet , dancing , Ukali only swaying a little on her ankles , but her sister clapping , whirling around the white bark of the trees . <p> Baboons materialized from nowhere and looped through the branches , rousing the birds , which rose like cinders until everything seemed to flutter and soar over their heads , to rejoice in the coming of Mathu . Ukali 's heart leapt like those baboons , flew like those birds . And Owino had been proud too . When he first looked on Mathu , he said , " Now I will never die . " <p> Ukali reaches her old village at midday , but the sun , which was staring so bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milky like an old man 's eye . The graveyard of afterbirth lies dim under the thorn trees , marbled with old stones and surrounded by a wire fence red with age . She finds Mathu 's stone and kneels beside it . She is thinking now God will swoop down like those baboons long ago and make her heart leap again at being Mathu 's mother . <p> The clouds thicken and sift down the hill . Rain starts to fall , at first touching her like feathers , then pelting hard , running down the slope in gorged veins . It seems to Ukali the whole mountain is crying , that Ol Doinyo Sabuk is finally awake and weeping . <p> Her coat with the brass buttons grows soaked and dripping , but still she does not move . Her knees sink into soft : ruts . Beyond the fence a few people hurry by , seeking a dry place , their voices floating to her through a watery curtain . <p> " Look , that is Ukali from Thika . What is she doing out there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting wet . " <p> " She ca n't be very well , can she ? " <p> Ukali feels herself sinking into the shoulder of Ol Doinyo Sabuk . All day her thoughts have darted like tiny shadows , like shards of black glass flying everywhere , but now they coalesce all at once into an awareness , into a fathomless shape . She says , " When I became Mathu 's mother , I promised myself I would keep his heart soft . When Owino stole eggs from the ostrich to sell , Mathu and I went all the way to her nest to say we were sorry . We picked up beetles , geckos , chameleons , every small thing , and carried them from the porch so his father could not stomp them with his shoe . Twice , crying , I showed Mathu the bloody tusk of an elephant Owino poached and Mathu cried with me , wailing like his heart was split apart . And each time his father spit on the legless woman in the cardboard box , I gave Mathu a shilling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Ukali speaks , there are flashes and rumbles and clouds shaking . The rain beats harder . She says , " But all these things were too difficult to keep up . The other boys , even Mathu 's father , called him girlish names and I could not bear his shame . I was afraid I had made his heart too soft and so I let him stomp the beetles and go with his father to kill the elephants . I let him steal eggs from the ostrich . I stopped giving him shillings for the legless woman . " <p> Ukali looks up at the drowned sky . She opens her mouth and the rain falls in . She starts to cry , to rock , to pull her fingers through the black mud and rub it on her face . <p> " Ukali . " Turning , she sees her sister walking toward her on silver puddles like they are carpets . She is holding a piece of old tin over her head . She comes and kneels beside Ukali . Her hands pat Ukali 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tiny black wings . She kisses Ukali 's cheek and mud sticks to her lips She does not say " Look at you , making a fool of yourself out here in the rain . Everyone in the village is talking . " <p> She says , " Here Sister , I will hold the tin over you while you cry . " <p> The drops strike the tin , landing like hooves and Ukali thinks she will never forget the sound they make , falling on her like a stampede , beating on this tiny roof of love her sister has made for them . <p> When the rain stops and Ukali 's tears have run their course , her sister says , " Is this Mathu you are crying about ? " <p> Ukali peers up with the taste of mud on her tongue . " Do you know , one day I saw Mathu spit on the legless woman over near Kabau ? " <p> They are quiet . Ukali lifts the stone and starts to dig . Her sister digs , too . When their fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another like they are conspirators in something too solemn to put in words . They form a hole the length of their arms , until their fingernails scrape the piece of plastic over Mathu 's cord . <p> Ukali eases her hand beneath the plastic and draws out the cord , only now this thing that once held him swimming in her is nothing but a piece of blackened root . <p> They walk holding hands , Ukali and her sister coming down Ol Doinyo Sabuk with the soggy wind on their backs and the cord deep in Ukali 's pocket . <p> At the Atki River , Ukali 's sister picks her way through the brush down to the bank and , stooping , dips her skirt in the water . She returns and cleans the mud from Ukali 's face . She washes Ukali until she is shining . <p> They move onto the bridge . After the rain , the river is churning . Ukali reaches in her pocket and lifts out the shriveled ligament . She tosses it high . It rides the wind , then grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes no splash when it touches the water . <p> Staring at the place it disappeared , Ukali says , " The girl was a person , " <p> " Yes , " her sister says . " She was a person . " <p> That night in Ukali 's dream , the dead girl comes again . She returns as the legless woman , but instead of spitting on her , this time Ukali is patting her face , draping her with the brass-button coat , holding a piece of tin over their heads . <p>
