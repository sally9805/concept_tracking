Rosalie bought me a telescope for my fiftieth birthday , an expensive brass one with a tripod , but the woods surround our new house and there 's nothing to see . She 's a typical social worker , who assumes reality can be shuffled about like the takeout items on some Chinese menu . <p> "  --  Max , honey , pessimism is n't an attractive quality . " And propping her naked self up , elbow against the mattress I 'd hauled into the empty living room last night , Rose winks and says , " Learn to look past the trees . " <p> My cryptic angel . <p> We 've been married less than a week : the bride , a twenty-six-year-old knockout Rumanian from the Lower East Side ; and the groom , strictly Central Park West via Brooklyn , an orthodox Jew , addicted to whatever might smuggle him beyond his tenuous middle-age . <p> I have a lymphoma . It 's in remission , almost eight months , but I feel awful , you know ? I honestly feel the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light fractured by all those trees , the morning sticky and hot . Rays thread the shade of the living room , glaring the dust white , the oak floor covered with scattered clothes and toiletties , four open suitcases , and a battery-powered mini fridge near the bed . <p> The movers promised to deliver the furniture Monday , the day after tomorrow . They 're Third World refugees , very superstitious , and believe weekends in Connecticut damage the soul . <p> I did n't make an issue . Who wants a Haitian voodoo curse and cancer . <p> Now the exquisite Mrs. Rosalie Nicole Kravitz nee Cuza sits crosslegged on the mattress , stiffening her back , yawning audibly , her skinny girl body deep in the brightness and shadows . <p> " Maybe you should 've tipped the guys a few dollars , " my bride says , meaning the movers . She 's staring down at her small breasts , as if instructing them instead of me , the nipples dark and the size of baby fingers . " People need motivation , honey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Our first born , " adding to the list while I lug the telescope toward another window . Besides the damn lymphoma , I 'm also getting a hernia . " Where 'd you find such uh . . . " act nice " . . . interesting gift ? " <p> " Beckman 's , " she says , and stands , arms stretching above her head , black hair tangled from sleep . God , the woman is definitely gorgeous . " C'm on , Max , you remember : Lower East Side , the antique shop off Canal Street . " <p> What am I , senile ? I 'm shooting the summer project there , in the Hasidic district . I do a couple of films a year  --  since age thirty-seven  --  the latest being a serio-comedy about sex , Jewish mysticism , and death , three favorite subjects . <p> Yesterday my analyst said I had become far too successful to end these obsessions ; she claimed I was an international neurotic whose art and anhedonia were indistinguishable . <p> Everybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but real emaciated . " The lovely Mrs. Kravitz recounting Beckman . " He 'd been a prisoner in one of those camps , no lie , honey , a Treblinka survivor . " The old man has stumbled into her social worker 's heart , her odd passion for tragedy and strangers . " We had coffee and ramcake , right in the back of his store , the cutest apartment . Oh , the stories , Maxy ! " Words turn cautious , " He . . . He knew your mother . " <p> The telescope faces the corner window . I adjust the brass tripod , staying quiet , not wanting to discuss Momma or her camp friend . <p> Then Rosalie 's embracing me , flushed and damp from the morning heat ; she , chest-high even on the tips of her toes , gazing up and asking , " Are you sorry ? " <p> " . . . ' Bout us ? " <p> The bride nods , says , " Uh-huh . " <p> " I adore you , " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married twice , both raging disasters . My fault , their fault , who cares . But finally I 'm blessed with an endearing , benevolent person ; even more unnerving , and how dissimilar to the international neurotic 's previous choices , an actual Jewish woman . ( The others were of the shiksa persuasion . ) <p> What I do n't tell her is the baseball bat story  --  same city , different shoot , the winter project  --  where the insane Beckman demolishes a 35mm Mitchell BNC , lenses included . The police had to come and drag the old man off the set . Fantastic scene : five cops wrestling a ninety-pound maniac , his fists whacking the air ; him shouting , " Big comedian ! Anti-semite ! Mumzer ! You 're not funny , Kravitz ! Our suffering ai n't funny ! May Jehovah bring a curse ! Let the Jews laugh at your misery ! " <p> He 's probably booby-trapped the telescope . <p> Rosalie and I met on Christmas Eve night , Seventh Avenue and Fifty-fifth , the Carnegie Deli just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding my left thigh , the pain scaring me bad enough to wet myself , and not one clue , you know , that was the terrifying part . Nothing unusual had occurred ; certainly nothing to cause an injury . When I looked down , I saw blood , the protruding bone . <p> And I fainted . <p> Only to be revived the hard way : by the Salvation Army abusing " Deck the Halls . " Trumpets fought shrieking clarinets as I peered into the snowfall , the flakes big feathery , reflecting Carnegie 's yellow light . I remember watching Rose kneel and the bits of ice on her eyelashes , the nonstop shiver , her cheeks and nose chilled raw ; remember the smile too , half concealed in a frayed , navy blue scarf . " I  --  I phoned the ambulance , " she said , and took a deli bag from the pocket of her denim jacket . " You like corn beef ? " <p> Precious Rosalie . <p> Mount Sinai had Drs . Cohen and Cohen , the cancer boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and radiation therapy for a multiple myeloma . The Cohens also showed me their video . Cartoon viruses wore Nazis uniforms . The Cohens wanted to talk Movie Deal while the Nazis invaded unsuspecting cells in the shape of eastern Europe . " Okay , wait , wait , " said a Cohen . " You 'll appreciate our dramatic effect . " Darkness began slipping along the landscape , the letters DNA super-imposed . Soon swastikas materialized , blip blip blip , marking the defeated countries . <p> " Get the concept ? " <p> I stared at the TV . " Nazis are in my body . " <p> " We used a film noir approach , " said Cohen . <p> " Sort of zombie Nazis , " said the other Cohen . <p> Rosalie visited during the evenings , brought paperback books , hot sandwiches , and wedges of chocolate cheesecake . I loved her immediately . But divorce can take a person 's confidence . With two divorces , you 're ready to date inanimate objects . <p> My anxieties had n't bothered Rose  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fears , laughed at all the jokes , and played gin rummy like a convicted felon . Death did n't have the chutzpa to face Rosalie the Rumanian . <p> Cohen and Cohen swore they 'd stopped the lymphoma . I pictured the zombie Nazis on the run , a retreating gloom , cartoon swastikas vanishing in the video rewind . <p> plib plib plib <p> But as I packed to leave Sinai , old thoughts reappeared . What if the Cohens had won the battle and not the war ? " What if the Nazi viruses were plotting new strategies ? What if I 'm walking down the street a month from now and my bones dissolve ? <p> Listen , it could happen . <p> Another thought : Beckman . May Jehovah bring a curse ! The insane Beckman <p> knew your mother <p> knew your . . . <p> Momma spoke a lot about Treblinka and the boy ; he would have been eighteen then , in 1943 , four years younger than her . " You should 've seen him pray , Maxy . Tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular rabbi . " She 'd be gazing out the kitchen window , rinsing the supper dishes , attending to images that had always eluded me . " His prayers killed a guard . Did I mention ? " Saying an old fact , " He prayed a guard dead . " <p> Terrific . The lunatic nebbish has connections . <p> I ca n't sleep . Rosalie 's snoring , not loud but the rhythm is irregular , a gummy clicking at the back of her throat . The forest noises do n't help , either . Tiny hooves patter through the leaves . Birds scream . Suicidal insects hurl themselves against the window screens . Connecticut nights are comparable to living in a zoo , except the animals here do shift work . <p> Moonlight powders the oak floor with silver , disrupting the shadows . I glance around the living room , the clothes separated into neat mounds , suitcases stacked , the telescope a phantom on scrawny tripod legs . <p> This weekend business is Mrs. Kravitz 's idea . Our Honeymoon Getaway . We 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit . My body fluids are down two quarts ; I 'm positive the lymphoma will snap a bone . And earlier she pouted , wanting to know , " Where 's your romantic spirit , Max ? " Am I supposed to answer that ? Maybe the damn thing took a suite at the Sherry Netherland . I would . Why do women . <p> Whoa . . . <p> Jesus , whoa ! <p> Light rushes from the lens of the telescope , laser-fine and brilliant , flaring across the room , hovering over the mattress , inches above me and the still unconscious Rose . I keep watching , squinting up , feeling my stomach constrict , hand groping the top of the mini fridge for my glasses . Trees stir , branches scrape the house . I smell urine and bowel  --  country ambiance , no doubt . Oh God . The light 's vibrating . It blooms suddenly , the room cut with such intolerable radiance that I have to shut my eyes . But the light is here and gone . <p> Rosalie has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her breasts , kissing the bride 's perspiring forehead . She sighs , fingers kneading the pillow , asleep yet mumbling , " . . . woveyoumex . " <p> " Love you too , " a whisper as I move toward my brass phantom . <p> The telescope looks normal . I tap the cylinder , the lenses , and automatically fantasize being the kid on Mr. Wizard . What would Don Herbert say ? Got a storm coming , Max . Freak lightning . Brass is an excellent conductor . <p> Of course , right . Lightning . <p> Or . . . <p> I peer out the window . " Or ? " <p> . . . Or the insane Beckman 's praying again . <p> My thigh bone starts to throb . The lymphoma is worse than a conscience . I decide to go with the lightning hypothesis but scan the woods to be prudent . Branches clatter ; the breeze enters the open windows , carrying the odor of urine and bowel . Leaves shiver under the moon . I mutter , " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping from behind a shrub , inflamed by Torah and Cabala , waving his fist and prancing among the trees . Then I peek into the lens of the telescope . <p> We 've been at the train station twelve hours now , since the morning , your Aunt Zadie , myself , Grandpop . Neighborhood people , mostly . I ask a young soldier why there is n't any food for us , any water . Such a handsome boy , Maxy , the grayest eyes . He says to be patient ; he says , " The cooks have prepared a splendid feast . Our camp 's small . But if you lose your way , just follow the Road to Heaven . " And I think , what a pretty name . And the young soldier smiles . . . <p> I 'm hearing Momma 's voice , the telescope forming the images : her memories fixed with a son 's details , a son 's invention , images collected from stories and from the photos she had arranged on the walls  --  histories pinned together and assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow and brown , strangers who belonged to me but had never visited Brooklyn -a son patching the dead faces to the dead lives , a way to explain her nightmares , her cries , her distance . <p> . . . The train arrives sometime during the night . We 're told to hurry and board . I hear the guards yelling , " You do n't want to miss supper.t Are n't you hungry ? Are n't you thirsty ? " <p> I 'm climbing into one of the cars when I notice a little girl squat on the platform and defecate . We had n't been allowed to use the bathrooms . . . <p> A soldier is next to the child , the young man who 'd spoken to my mother , both spotlighted in the beam of an overhead lamp . I see him holster his pistol and absently unstrap the rifle from his shoulder . Everything pantomimed , everything silent . Steam rises off the long train as the last of the passengers step inside the darkness . Only the soldier and the child remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six , maybe seven , I do n't know . Strings of black hair web her cheeks . She is shaking tearful . The soldier lifts his rifle , lamplight glinting the barrel . He sends the butt of the weapon into her skull . The train begins to glide past them . Arms and hands reach between the wooden slats of the boxcars . The child is lying in the luminous circle , her limbs crooked , blood obscuring her face . Now the young soldier nudges the body with the toe of his boot . <p> The asshole is actually grinning . <p> Did he enjoy the evening ? Will he and his psychotic friends grab a beer later and swap child mutilation techniques ? After six analysts and nineteen years as a couch junkie , I still ca n't fathom the madness of my mother 's life . <p> A hunched figure is running atop the boxcars . He  --  no , no , she , it 's a woman  --  she drops to one knee and pivots , aiming a pistol at two soldiers who are chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the train . Both hands grip the pistol , her arms outstretched , rigid , then the recoil and tiny flashes . One guard collapses in place , the other toppling backwards . All of it seen but not heard . The young soldier on the platform brings his rifle to eye-level . Again the woman fires . Once , twice . Chunks of the boy 's neck rip away . A dozen or so guards hurry across the moving boxcars , toward the woman . Their weapons spike flames , cracking the shadows . <p> She 's been shot . <p> Her leg . . . <p> I immediately feel pain in my left thigh . I 'm beginning to question the whole multiple myeloma thing . Cancer would n't be this empathic . <p> Her leg . . . <p> Our wounds match . Whatever I had experienced Christmas Eve is identical to what I am seeing here : her blood , the protruding bone . And she 's looking at me . Is n't she looking at me ? The yellow lights blink over her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That face . <p> The woman crawls to the far edge of the boxcar , hesitates , then falls into the night . <p> I turn from the telescope , huffing a breath and scanning the living room , the moonlit suitcases , the folded clothes on the oak floor . Beckman , you sonuvabitch . Our bed 's empty , sheets bunched in points and cuds . <p> No mistake . The woman was Rose . <p> Trees line the highway , rimmed with a pink , early morning sky . I am driving the Cherokee , heading for the city . A leatherbag containing the telescope and tripod rests upright on the passenger seat , fastened by a safety harness . I 've been plotting strategies , how to confront Beckman while managing my homicidal impulses , but each plan ends with me strangling the guys yelling , Thief Where is she ? Where 's Rosalie ? I wo n't report him to the police . What do you say , exactly ? An obsessed hasid prayed my wife into World War II ? <p> Uh-huh , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low behind the woods , flanking the road like a shy companion , golden amid the damp branches and leaves . <p> My pain 's disappeared . Totally , poof , G-O-N-E . I am trying to stay indifferent , you know , composed . Mother always said , " If God 's miracles get you too excited , He 'll change His mind . " ( The mysteries of celestial justice . I To be without pain is remarkable , though , a blessing . <p> Momma did n't trust miracles . Pleasure was the intermission of an ongoing catastrophe ; serenity , a betrayal of old ghosts : she could n't forgive herself for escaping Treblinka . I grew up hearing the sobs , waking to her private horrors , and I 'd see Mother huddled beside my bed , knees to chest , rocking , rocking her shape thin and delicate beneath a cotton gown . The dreams did not vary , the same lonely terrain , the same anguish . Factual dreams : a German soldier raping hers Aunt Zadie murmuring " ... Let him . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you beautiful for a reason . Please , offer yourself  --  let him . " <p> When she became pregnant with me , the German hid her in the back of his laundry truck and drove to a town four kilometers to the west , Wolka Okranglik . This was the day before the Committee of Resistance torched the camp . Three hundred and fifty inmates got past the barbed wire fence . <p> My analyst says escaping Treblinka did n't mean you survived ; that living and surviving are n't necessarily synonymous . Perhaps it 's true . But how does a son grieve a dead parent with a pulse ? I know she would look at me and see only that soldier , her months of imprisonment . <p> The night Mother killed herself , a lifetime ago now , I 'd been doing stand-up at Village Gate . Her brother Abe had called and read the note : <p> Max , I am sorry . Grandpop believed our souls ca n't remember us after we die . Hope he is right . Love you . <p> Drs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a zombie Nazi . Momma said my father died while driving her to Wolka Okranglik . <p> " We 're closed . " <p> " Beckman , open the goddamn door . " <p> " I got a gun . " <p> Jesus , he does . I 'm staring at him , a hand cupped above my brow and pressed to the front window of the store , the telescope bag strapped over my left shoulder . Beckman is crouching , knees bent , waving a .357 Smith &; Wesson , his style reminiscent of Dirty Harry , except for the yarmulke , the tallis , and the maroon plaid , alte kocker bathrobe . <p> " I have bullets , " he says . "  --  A gun with bullets . " He also has a palsy tremor . " You understand my English ? We 're closed , no Saturday business . " <p> " Hey , it 's me . " <p> The old man squints . " Me who ? " <p> " You blind putz , get your glasses . " <p> " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucks the .357 magnum under his arm . Fingers burrow into the robe and retrieve a pair of wire-rims . He hooks them around his ears , through the white , hasidic ringlets . His eyes go bright . " Ah-ha ! Kravitz , the movie star ! Mr. Comedian ! Ha ! " <p> " Where 's my wife , Beckman . " <p> " The birthday boy ! Ha ! " <p> What a fruitcake . <p> " Hold the horses ! Hold the horses ! " He 's shuffling over to the door , each step excruciatingly slow ; muttering , " A privilege , Mr. Hotsy-Totsy Kravitz . " <p> I hear the lock click , then a metallic thud , the sound of the pistol hitting wood . Crazy Beckman starts to slump to the floor as I enter the shop , and I catch him , grasping his waist . Skinny legs fold inward . His breathing is all wheezy . For a moment he has the appearance of a frail , confused bird . It does n't last . He shakes loose from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the store , his monologue soft , continuous , " Maxy Kravitz , pretty Chesia 's Treblinka kid , ha ! , wooo-weee , " disappearing behind a velour curtain . <p> Wonderful . Beckman 's sincerely deranged . But fight now I 'm not feeling too sane myself . The walls seem to creep in and shrink the room . Antiques fill the comers with dark points . Okay . How bizarre can he be ? Relax , handle the situation . Demonstrate your tremendous inter-personal skills . I brace the telescope bag against the counter and follow him . <p> Beyond the curtain , his dimlit apartment smells like Vicks Vaporub . Newspapers and books litter the Persian rag . Lopsided piles are wedged about the furniture , expensive pieces , two Queen Anne wing-backs , a mahogany desk , and a partially refinished Louis the Something chiffonier . <p> Beckman whispers , "  --  Crummy heart . The doctors , they think I 'm supposed to be dying . " He is sprawled on the sofa , eyes shut , bathrobe and tallis open to a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his chest . " The telescope belonged to your momma 's friend . " A voice raw and weak , " That German bum who helped her escape . " <p> " Let 's discuss Rosalie , " I say , verrry non-confrontational , Mr. Smooth , determined not to excite the old man . " Tell me the problem . Why hurt my wife ? Seriously , she 's an innocent person . Is n't this between us ? " <p> The approach has class . I am Brando in The Godfather , asking for compassion ; hoping for reasonable men . ' q murdered him , " he says . " . . . What ? " <p> " Chesia 's lover , her Nazi with the laundry truck . " Beckman sits up , crosses those chalky , twig legs , tugging on the hem of the robe . " I prayed him dead . " <p> The room turns warm , the odor of Vicks burning my throat and nose . I feel jittery inside , brittle . His prayers killed a guard . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never said which guard . Nor do I remember her connecting the two stories  --  the German and the teenage hasid  --  or maybe I had quit listening . <p> " . . . ' A sweet baby , ' Chesia called me . ' You 're still a baby , Yetzel , ' she 'd say . " The old man 's caught in history , speaking of the Treblinka days , how he worshiped Mother and hated her soldier , the years spent finding his peace . " So last winter , three shyster doctors decided I was dying , and again I got angry . I gave up too much . Children . Grandchildren . But who could marry ? " He does a wobbly rise off the sofa , his words sly , " We know the miseries of love , huh , Kravitz ? " <p> " I do now , yes . " <p> " Ha , good . " <p> Beckman is gripping my arm . We walk toward the mahogany desk . It 's cluttered with photographs , fifteen , perhaps twenty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairway near the curtain . <p> He nods at the pictures . " You recognize anyone ? " <p> Glare and shadow smear the images . I tilt my head to block the light . Nobody 's familiar . His collection reminds me of the photos that had covered our wall in Brooklyn , the faces worn to the skull . <p> " C'm on , pay attention , " says Beckman , obviously irritated . Fingers clutch a silver frame and twitch out weird Parkinsonian rhythms . " Look , Mr. Show Bid'ness , look . " <p> Like a dummy I 'm being accommodating , bobbing along to his tremor . Finally , I snatch the thing . <p> The old man stares at me as if I 've slapped him . " Chesia 's Nazi boy , " he mumbles , his hands quivering . And louder , " It 's in the blood . You and your poppa , both Nazis . " <p> Right . Take a pill for Christsake . <p> With enormous control , I apologize , demeaning my impatience , pretending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a maniac . Life wo n't be worth the effort unless Rosalie 's safe ; unless we 're together . <p> He wiggles his eyebrows , Groucho style . " Such a funny Nazi boy . " <p> I ignore the comment . Sticks and stones , etc . There are no new names , none I have n't said to myself . <p> Even his photograph 's demented . A cluster of ten prisoners stand among the trees , skeletons wearing only muddy underwear and dark caps . Written beneath this scene , the penmanship shaky , the ink a faint brownish-yellow : Committee of Resistance , August 2nd , 1943 . Success at last ! <p> Beckman speaks quietly , close to my ear . <p>  --  And Jehovah says , " What can I do for you , Yetzel ? " And I say , " Lord , Chesia 's Nazi boy ought to feel our pain . " And God says , " You want mental or physical ? " And I say , " Please , a little of each . " <p> She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her thigh bandaged , a piece of soiled cloth wrapped tight and knotted , the blood dried to a half-dollar sized disk . Rose ? Oh Rose , is that you ? The black hair shaved , eyes uninhabited , gazing straight at the camera , porcelain bones and paperskin : another zombie on the run . <p> Did you survive ? <p> Beckman mutters , " The soldiers brought her to the camp , " and giggling , poking my shoulder , " your bride did n't stay . " <p> The old man died , three months ago now . His heart . And the telescope arrived the week after the funeral . Death apparently does n't phase him . The guy 's relentless , my hasidic Terminator . A note from his attorney said I 'd been " bequeathed item #38-5 . " He hoped Mr. Beckman 's thoughtfulness would ease my grief . <p> Lawyer humor . <p> I 've set the telescope on the balcony . Across the street is Central Park , a spectacular view of autumn . Though relieved to be back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave my apartment , and the answering machine 's loaded with messages which remain unanswered . <p> Today I did the usual . Peered into the lens ; watched other people 's lives , judged performances . It 's what I do best . The park was glorious this morning . An intense October sun ignited the trees , all frost , all fire , red-orange and lime . But I felt dissatisfied with the angle of the frame , the skewed distribution of light , the histrionic colors . Blah blah blah . Forever the methodical auteur , forever the observer . Some prisons are harder to escape than Treblinka . <p> Where 's my Committee of Resistance , Beckman ? When does the laundry truck arrive ? <p> The old man swore Rosalie had n't known his plan , repeating what Grandpop once told Momma , Souls forget , they do n't keep their memories . Then Beckman confessed , The woman did n't recognize me . And if you went to her , she would n't remember you . <p> I am the second generation heir to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness , reluctantly trailing the zombies . But it 'll be done soon . I can feel that too . <p> The evening 's here . I go to the balcony ; the wind , abrupt and gritty , stinging my hands , my face . Beckman has n't finished with his Nazi boy . A farewell torture , Rosalie is on the other side of the lens . <p> She appears at sundown , one show a night  --  the pursuit over boxcars , torching the camp , the panicked race to the woods  --  and these scenes were consistent until recently . Now I 've begun seeing the shape of a man jogging behind her . Through high , reedy brush , amid pine trees , the silhouette 's undefined yet present , shadows failing to camouflage his inept stride . <p> The runner is me , unmistakably me . <p> Who cares what Yetzel Beckman said . The guy did n't have the Jehovah franchise . Anybody can pray . And tonight I will be with her , a celebration on the other side of the lens ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Whenever . I 've been reading the Cabala . You know , lewish mysticism . The book says , our souls are paired from the exact moment God creates them . It also warns us , nothing 's guaranteed , lifetimes may pass before the right souls meet . But we know , instantly , intuitively , we know the contours of that devastating fit . I do n't need Rose to remember Maxy Kravitz , swooning at our reunion is n't necessary . All I need her to do is turn around . You listening , Rose ? Just turn around and wait for the runner . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : How the Panda Evolved <p> <p> By Ron Savage <p> Ron Savage 's short fiction has appeared in Temple University 's literary magazine , Modem Short Stories , and F &SF,; among other magazines .
