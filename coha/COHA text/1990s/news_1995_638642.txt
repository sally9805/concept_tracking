<p> Delisa Falsetto placed it between her lips and took a long , sweet draw . <p> Then she delicately set it in the tray , and exhaled - slowly . The smile on her face was telling . <p> To the ancient Mayans , this was " kuots . " In the dialect of modern-day Mexican Indians , in the Lahuatl language , it is " yetl picietl . " In modern Spanish , it is " puro . " <p> To Delisa Falsetto , sitting in a nouveau LoDo restaurant amid billows of white smoke and the swirling motions of single-malt scotches being consumed by others there , it was simply a Monte Cruz . <p> A light brown , artfully wrapped cylinder . <p> A cigar . <p> Falsetto is riding the cutting edge of the latest in U.S. trends for those with perhaps a bit too much leisure time on their hands or a dearth of things for which they can part with excess cash . <p> " This is not a guy thing , " Falsetto said as she put down the stogie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a drag on a cigarette she 'd just lit up . <p> Indeed . <p> Flyfishing . In-line skating . Golf . The World Wide Web . And now , a considerably less-healthy and largely nocturnal addiction : smoking cigars . <p> " In the last three years what we 've seen is basically a 30 percent increase in the consumption of cigars , " said Jerry Goodman , owner of Jerri 's Tobacco Shop on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver . <p> " This whole market has changed so much in the last three years . " <p> These days , cigar smoking has become , for some , almost cultish . <p> There is a glossy , upscale magazine devoted to cigars , and the stogie-puffing lifestyle , called Cigar Aficionado . Stogie , though , is n't a word the magazine prefers to use identifying its chief subject . Nor cheroot . Along with the numerous photos of famous folks boldly holding and smoking stogies , the magazine offers its readers reviews of various types of cigars . <p> In the summer 1995 issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macanudo Petit Corona with a ring gauge of 38 as being " a mild , elegant cigar with a toasty aroma . Flavors of dry spice and wood dominate . " Price : $ 2.40 . <p> Meaty and spicy <p> The Veultabajo Corona , it says , " has some unusual flavors of strong hot spices with a meaty aroma . " Price : $ 2.15 . <p> Elegant . That about sums up the image the cult of the cigar tries so hard to cultivate . <p> There 's another magazine published in Rhode Island that specializes in erotic writings having to do , somehow , with cigar smoking . <p> There 's the Black Tie Connoisseurs Club in Barrington , Ill. , which offers its members five new cigars each month , and publishes The Wrapper , a newsletter about stogies . <p> There are cigar-oriented trips , and vacations . The June issue of the Robb Report , a magazine that touts itself as being " for the affluent lifestyle , " sports a photo of four Macanudo cigars on its cover . And there are cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moondance restaurant on Market Street . <p> To be sure , not everyone takes the cigar scene quite so seriously . <p> Consider JR , a company that distributes cigars , at a discount , through a colorfully written catalog . <p> " OK boys , " reads a recent edition of the company 's catalog , not to be mistaken for a haven of politically correct gender references . " We 've done it again yep , back by popular demand our ' Crap A ' and ' Crap B ' bundles you all came to love in our Christmas flyer . " <p> Falsetto said she felt perfectly at home puffing away with the boys at Moondance a few weeks ago . <p> But Sandra Beckwith , who publishes a newsletter in New York state " that takes a lighthearted look at male behavior , " begs to differ . In a recent release , she argued that men smoke cigars precisely because women ca n't stand them . <p> A last refuge <p> " Cigar smoking is the last male bastion , " she wrote . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beckwith wrote : " These popular events in clubs and restaurants offer a predominantly male group an opportunity to escape from women while they enjoy premium cigars in the company of like-minded puffers . " <p> In fact , Falsetto appeared to be the only woman smoking cigars among the several dozen people gathered at the lower downtown restaurant . <p> And some of the attendees complained that they like such events because unapproving wives and girlfriends do n't allow them to smoke the stogies at home . <p> " Where else can you go where you can smoke a cigar , eat a good meal , and not get a rash of ( droppings ) , " said Henry Schlueter , a lawyer who was smoking a Dunhill cigar that he guessed was 5 inches long and had a ring gauge of 46 , meaning it was fairly fat . <p> The menu for the cigar outing at Moondance featured boursin-stuffed rib-eye steak and peppered salmon with fennel corn relish as well as an appetizer of tequila shrimp and sauteed mussels . <p> Four cigars , wine and single-malt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it comes to cigar smoking at home , Schlueter said , " I get mine out and I get sent to the back porch . " <p> " I 'm surprised my wife does n't like it . It keeps the women away , " added Glenn Axelson , who said he 's been smoking cigars for about three years and enjoys the smoking gatherings . <p> Schlueter said his favorite smoke is a Cuba Alianos , Churchill-sized . Churchills are among the Lincoln Logs of the cigar world . They 're usually at least 6 inches long with large ring gauges . Winston liked his smokes large . <p> At least part of the appeal of cigar smoking these days has to do with the details . As is the case with the gear used in such things as flyfishing and technical climbing , understanding cigars means learning a panoply of measurements , designs , brand names and style . Especially style . <p> All of this , of course , is acquired . Just like taste . <p> There are Robustos , Toros , Palmas , Petit Coronas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magellans , Balboas , Panatelas , Presidentes , Viajantes , Rothschilds , Largo Elegentes , and Brevas . And that 's a small fraction of the list . <p> Some have long-leaf fillers . Some do not . <p> The most expensive have cameroon wrappers imported from Africa . Some 40 years ago , most cigar smokers - 99 percent , says Goodman - preferred what is called a double claro wrapper . That 's a green cigar . Today , the pendulum has shifted to heavier shades like the " natural " wrapper , which is light brown , or the " maduro " which is even darker . <p> " The green wrapper is like a Coors Light . And the dark wrapper is like a Heineken , " Goodman said . <p> The most popular size of cigar , he said , is probably either the corona or the double corona . Those generally are between 5 1/2 and 6 3/4 inches long . <p> The most commonly known brand name of cigar is the Macanudo , he said . Macanudos once were made in the Canary Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davidoff also is one of the premiums . Once the world 's largest distributor of Cuban cigars , Davidoff no longer carries them because it questioned the quality of that country 's tobacco products in recent years , Goodman said . <p> Walking into the Davidoff store in mid-town Manhattan is like walking into a jewelry store . The huge stogie protruding from the mouth of Demi Moore in a recent photo in People magazine was a Davidoff . <p> That Schlueter could even guess the length and ring gauge of the cigar he was puffing was something of an anomaly at the recent cigar dinner in Denver . <p> It does n't take a neurosurgeon to figure out that lots of the folks who attend these cigar events have n't been cigar aficionados for long , and really do n't have much of a clue about the sport of stogie puffing . <p> " Do you leave them on ? " asked Dave Zook of the bands on the cigars . <p> " You take them off , unless you 're in London , " responded Les Sechler , seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershwin 's " Porgy and Bess " on a piano that also served as a table for four other diners . <p> Sechler , a transplanted Californian now living in Evergreen , offered a listener another little morsel . <p> " This is a Cuban cigar , " he said holding up one of those rarities , and speaking with the tone of someone describing an illegal stash of some narcotic substance or other . <p> " The good stuff , " he said . " I get it from a guy I know in L.A. " <p> Such good stuff , technically , has been illegal ever since the U.S. severed relations with Cuba in 1963 after Fidel Castro came to power in the island nation . <p> Technically , even owning a Cuban cigar in the U.S. could bring fines as high as $ 50,000 . Per violation . <p> The U.S. Treasury Department , and its Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( the folks that helped stage the Branch Davidian theatrics in Waco , Texas ) do n't purport to treat the matter lightly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking underscores the need to remind you and your customers of the prohibitions that have been in place for many years with respect to cigars of Cuban origin , " the Treasury Department wrote in a June letter to tobacco retailers . <p> " We recognize the prohibitions that apply to Cuban cigars may deprive many consumers of a sought-after product , " the agency continued . " Contrary to what many people may believe , it is illegal for travelers to bring into the United States Cuban cigars acquired in third countries ( such as Canada , England or Mexico . ) We will continue to make every effort to apply the provisions of the Cuban sanctions to all persons . " <p> Goodman traces the explosion in cigar popularity to the birth of Cigar Aficionado magazine three years ago . <p> And that 's created a minor headache for stores like his . To make a cigar , from seed to final product , takes between three and five years . But five years ago , producers were n't expecting the current boom in cigar interest . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by women , he said , taste does n't appear to be gender-specific . <p> " It 's like anything else that you go out to consume . I think that it 's based on individual tastes to a great extent , " he said . <p> " We do have a lot of women who want the same size a man smokes , " he said . " The women 's part of the market is not a huge part of the market by any means , but we find more women who are more willing to puff on a cigar or to try their husband 's or boyfriend 's cigar , and find them very tasty .
