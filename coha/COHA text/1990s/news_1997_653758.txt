<p> " The rental of an automobile is not an inalienable right granted in the Constitution , " Richard Aronow , president of the New York Rental Vehicle Association , observes . Yet the scope of those rights has provoked a growing , national brawl , with Avis , the No. 2 rental agency , at its center . <p> The company faces a lawsuit over complaints that several outlets in North and South Carolina have refused to rent cars to blacks and that the top executives of Avis have hesitated to step in . In New York , the lawsuit by the state Attorney General to keep Avis and others from rejecting younger drivers has reached the state 's highest court . The state Assembly plans to investigate whether some rental companies systematically turned down blacks and Hasidic Jews , as well . <p> Most recently , two former employees have accused Avis supervisors and telephone representatives at the company 's global reservations center in Tulsa of rejecting corporate accounts for those who appeared to be Jewish , especially Hasidic Jews , in what the employees described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that charge higher rates to Brooklyn , Queens and Bronx drivers are the targets of Federal legislation to be introduced on Tuesday that would outlaw basing rates on where a renter lives . <p> All these complaints bear on industry practices that rental companies consider necessary to making money in a business built on putting valuable , potentially lethal assets into strangers ' hands . An 1866 Federal law that bars discrimination because of race or religion has been interpreted by the courts as applying to a broad range of businesses and services , including schools , restaurants and rental agencies . The companies say they still must be choosy about whom they will rent to and at what prices . The young , the accident-prone , the Brooklyn resident all threaten , experience shows , to cost the car rental companies more than they pay . <p> " The rental of an auto combines the exposure of an insurance company and a bank rolled into one , " Mr. Aronow , whose group leads the defense against threatened state legislation , said . <p> Banking and insurance , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes slide into bias . Some neighborhoods , however prosperous , with high concentrations of members of racial minorities have found that red-lining makes mortgages or insurance coverage scarce . <p> Challenges to such practices have increasingly succeeded . Federal agencies have forced many banks to step up their lending in neighborhoods they had shunned . Pressed by protests and lawsuits , many big insurers have begun writing homeowners policies in inner-city neighborhoods  --  and are finding it profitable . <p> In the restaurant business , Denny 's , a unit of the Flagstar Companies , agreed in 1994 to pay $54 million to settle accusations that some of its outlets had refused to serve black customers . The lead lawyer in that suit , John P. Relman of the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs , is also handling the Federal lawsuit in Wilmington , N.C. , that accuses Avis and its local franchisee of bias against blacks . <p> Avis , pointing out that more than 42 percent of its employees are members of racial minorities , says that any discrimination was the fault of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton 3d , who operates Avis lots in Wilmington and four other cities in the Carolinas . <p> " Avis did not discriminate against blacks , against Jews or against any other majorities or minorities , " said Henry R. Silverman , chief executive of HFS Inc. , the Parsippany , N.J. , franchising operation that bought Avis last October . <p> Mr. Silverman acknowledged that Mr. Dalton might have shown bias . Avis , based in Garden City , L.I. , tried to take over his locations in December , but a Federal court in North Carolina blocked any immediate action . Mr. Silverman called the new complaints of discrimination against Jews false  --  prompted , he said , by lawyers who were trying to manipulate the media and embarrass Avis into settling the Wilmington case . <p> " This is a new way  --  I 'm trying to use a nicer word than extortion  --  that lawyers for plaintiffs try to extract money from corporations , " Mr. Silverman said in a phone interview . <p> Mr. Dalton and his lawyers refused to comment beyond issuing a statement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The North Carolina case has gotten wide exposure , but the details of what happened in Tulsa are still emerging . <p> In about 1990 , the company says , underage drivers falsely claiming to work for yeshivas  --  Jewish day schools , usually high schools  --  began renting cars under the schools ' corporate accounts . Some used the cars as taxis , trash haulers and , in one case , a hearse , then returned them in sad shape . The company says it alerted its reservation center in Tulsa to avoid establishing corporate accounts that were likely to be abused , checking customers from the Northeast most closely . <p> According to two former employees , however , managers of the division that sets up small-business accounts responded with a broader pattern of discrimination . In a sworn statement he provided , William B. Ward said that supervisors had coached him and other telephone representatives to watch for " Jewish-sounding names , " look for locations like New York and New Jersey and listen for " Jewish accents , " and then deny applications for corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr. Ward recalled that a supervisor blamed an agent for granting a corporate account to a New Jersey fish market that the supervisor said was a yeshiva . Another supervisor put a caller on a speaker phone to demonstrate the screening process , Mr. Ward said in the sworn statement . " We do n't want your business , " the supervisor said . He hung up , then looked at Mr. Ward and explained , " That was a yeshiva . " <p> Usually , Mr. Ward said , the slight was more subtle . Customers were given accounts that yielded discounts no better than those available to auto club members . True corporate accounts offered larger discounts , ample insurance coverage and a free day 's rental for every 15 paid , he explained . Over about a year and a half , Mr. Ward said , he denied hundreds of such accounts . <p> In Tulsa , a metropolitan area of 743,000 where there are no yeshivas and the Jewish population is estimated at 3,000 , Mr. Ward said that employees were befuddled . " The term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some kind of Yiddish cuss word , " Mr. Ward said in an interview . <p> In January , Mr. Ward was dismissed after being accused of cheating on an incentive program , a charge he is challenging in an unemployment compensation proceeding . <p> Another former telephone agent , Elaine M. Rodgers , said in a court filing in the Wilmington case that she was instructed to spot " yeshivas " by customers ' accents and addresses , though she said agents used the word to mean Hasidic Jews in particular . <p> Avis said that no customers had complained about prejudice against Jews and that it did not screen customers by accent or name . " The suggestion that there was any anti-Semitic motive to it is preposterous , " John H. Carley , the Avis general counsel , said . Agents may have applied the term " yeshiva " more generally to customers who tried to deceive the company , he said . " Ultimately , it may have been used to denote in some minds a problem , not an ethnic group , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 in the Carolinas and several more in Tulsa  --  have described discrimination by Mr. Dalton and his five franchises , with some instances dating back two decades . Mr. Dalton , several said , instructed them to find any pretext for turning down blacks , whom he often referred to in derogatory terms , and also shunned members of the military . His business rationale was that blacks were more likely to return cars dirty or damaged or use them to deal in drugs . <p> According to a statement that an Avis complaint handler in Tulsa filed in the Wilmington case , Mr. Dalton said , " I own these cars , and I can rent to whomever I want . " <p> That policy , according to the three black women who filed the class action lawsuit , humilated them  --  spoiling vacations , family reunions and other long-held plans . One of the plaintiffs , Lerline E. Wilson , made a telephone reservation to drive a rental car about 300 miles from Mr. Dalton 's Florence , S.C. , lot to visit a mother-in-law dying of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the lawsuit , Ms. Wilson  --  then 54  --  was told she was too old to drive so far . <p> Several employees of the Dalton franchises said they had forwarded complaints to the Avis service center in Tulsa . Here , employees said they had alerted their bosses , including those at company headquarters . <p> " You can imagine the disgust , " said Dixie Dean Bailey , a former Avis employee in Tulsa who recalled having more than 100 conversations with Mr. Dalton about the complaints . " In order to get your paycheck , you had to file reports , but nothing was ever done . " <p> Sue P. Parker , third in command at Tulsa from 1985 to 1994 , said in a court filing that the complaints came up at meetings attended by all the top Avis executives . Mr. Silverman , however , said that until former employees made sworn statements late last year , the company lacked enough evidence to take action .

Schumer , a Brooklyn Democrat , plans to introduce a bill in Congress to keep car rental companies from charging higher rates based on where customers live  --  as Hertz and Budget do for residents of Brooklyn , Queens and the Bronx , no matter where they rent in New York City . <p> " The kind of discrimination we 're talking about is broad-brushed and callous , " Mr. Schumer said . " Once they say anyone from Queens pays a higher rate , maybe it 's a short step to saying anyone who 's a black or Jew deserves a higher rate as well . " <p> Budget charged Bronx drivers $127.99 a day  --  $54 more than the regular rate  --  for picking up a car in Manhattan , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The company 's chairman , Jack A. Frazee , said in a letter to Mr. Schumer on March 5 that Budget was seeking to limit its losses in New York City  --  $8 million last year , he said  --  by charging more to those most likely to steal their cars or have accidents , including residents of some boroughs . <p> " It is a fairness in pricing concept , " Mr. Frazee said , similar to the geographical rating systems used by insurance companies . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : March 19 , 1997 , Wednesday <p> CORRECTION : A picture yesterday with an article about discrimination complaints against Avis , showing William B.
