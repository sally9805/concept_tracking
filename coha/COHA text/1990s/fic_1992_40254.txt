" What were those dull bonks I heard this morning ? " <p> Jason and Mopsy had just come down to breakfast , and I threw up my hands in mock dismay as she put that old , old question to me . <p> " Why , Mopsy , do n't tell me you have n't read my travel articles ! Shame on you ! Those were the famous thudding church bells of Viborra ! ' Thunk , thunk , thunk , ' they say . ' Welcome , Mopsy ! Welcome to Viborra ! " <p> The poor girl went pink and the dining hall of the PanLupus Hotel erupted into good-natured laughter . The diners laughed and the waiters laughed and so did Ugo , the jolly old elf at the buffet table , who was sprinkling a bit of this and a bit of that into his tangy and oh so scrumptious herring paste  --  a Viborran delight called huegma . <p> Nonresonant church bells ? Freshly pounded huegma smeared on warm buns straight from the oven ? Romantic moonlight rides in circular boats not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unfamiliar vegetables on display  --  so knobby and streaky ? Narrow cobbled streets ? Bargain belts  --  and purses too ? Great fun at breakfast ? <p> Well , yes , and these are just a few of he joys awaiting the traveler who finds his way to this lovely old colonial city nestled in a sapphire cove under a cerulean sky on the Sea of Tessa  --  known locally as Da Magro , or " the Burning Sea . " <p> We had arrived the night before on a high-wing Tessair Fokker  --  I and my new chums , Jason and Mopsy Crimm . With my port-of-entry know-how I soon had us cleared through customs  --  a painless business on the whole . The Crimms were dazzled by my moves as I pushed in ahead of others , jumping this line and that one . With a wave and a knowing wink I steered them quickly through all the control points . There was one awkward moment , when the Propriety Officer caught sight of Jason 's hideous jogging shoes . But then the officer  --  doing a priceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfy on long flights ) , and the poor man was all but speechless . <p> " Chick Jardine ! " he sputtered . " Winner of five gold Doobie Awards for travel writing ! How I envy your powers of description , sir ! " <p> After that , as you can imagine , the city was ours . <p> This brings me , however , to my one teeny caveat for you folks planning your first trip to Viborra . Be advised that the Ministry of Fitness and Propriety maintains a Vigilance Desk at the airport . If the duty officer there perceives you to be a lout , rich or poor , he will assign you to the Morono Palace , a magnificent hotel for louts on the eastern beach , or mud flats , just across the Bal River from Viborra proper , regardless of any previous arrangement you have made . As a registered lout ( stamped thus on your visa in luminescent orange ink  --  LOUT ) , you will be somewhat restricted in your movements , to the eastern beach and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nimmo , or the Plaza of Louts . You will also be fitted with and made to wear an orange plastic wristband for ready identification . <p> But not to worry . The guests at the Morono Palace have loads of fun in their own way , and prices are considerably cheaper in that district  --  particularly on belts , yo-yos , fishnet tank tops , heavy woolen shower curtains , and tortoise-shell flashlights . You can even watch these unique torches being made in ancient workshops , where the delicate craft of shell-routing is jealously guarded and passed on from father to son . And the central dining hall at the Morono is a show in itself , with its famous rude waiters cavorting comically about in striped jerseys as they insult the guests , and with its Morono Mega-Spread , a free-for-all salad bar 188 feet long . Then , blazing and blaring atop the Palace , there is the legendary Club Nimmo , reputed to be the world 's loudest nightclub , with music and hilarity and flashing lights twenty-four hours a day . <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her making a move toward the bud vase on our breakfast table . " Smell , but do n't touch . That delicate white blossom is not so innocent as it appears . That , my dear , is an artu flower from the volcanic highlands , and it exudes a toxic alkaline resin that can blister the fingers . A defense mechanism , you see . " <p> It was all coming back to me , remarkably enough  --  a torrent of Viborran memories and lore , on this , my first visit to the old city in many years . I thought how lucky the Crimms were to have scraped acquaintance with me , for I seldom reveal my identity to ordinary people on my jaunts around the world , knowing and hating the fuss chat always follows . My helpful tips to less experienced travelers are strictly confined to my prizewinning magazine articles and my widely syndicated newspaper column , and when I hear star-struck people murmuring around me ( they having spotted my trademark turquoise jacket ) , I go all deaf and ignorant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitate to one another . In our chat on the Fokker it came out that Jason and Mopsy , far from being ordinary , had appeared on the covers of nine popular financial magazines in the past year , posed in front of their restored Victorian house , with expensive new silvery cars parked in the driveway . Mopsy showed me the most recent cover , and an amusing photo it was , too . Jason , his arms straining under the load , is standing behind a red wheelbarrow that is filled and indeed spilling over with documents representing his sensible budgets , wise investments , and long-range tax-planning strategies . At his side is our little gamine , Mopsy , with a sheaf of CDs and tax-free municipal bonds spread fanwise and peeping out ever so coyly from her bodice . She confided to me , with pardonable pride , that of all the grinning young couples ever to appear on the covers of these magazines in front of their restored Victorian houses , she and Jason were judged to have the least-blemished shutters and the most beautifully complacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth knowing , and the feeling was mutual , to put it mildly . Can you picture the scene at the airport when the officer spilled the beans  --  that I was award-winning syndicated columnist Chick Jardine ? The Crimms were addled with delight ! <p> It also turned out that none of us was paying for any thing . Plane fare , hotel rooms , meals  --  all free . I never pay , on principle , as a guest of the world , and the ever-calculating Crimms , who read forty-one financial newsletters each month , had managed to get in on the ground floor of something called the Ponzi Travelbirds , through which society , as Early Birds , they will enjoy free travel for life , at the expense of all Late Birds joining the club . Need I say it ? My kind of folks ! <p> After breakfast we were off for a day of adventure under the azure vault of the sky , with yours truly acting as cicerone . We clambered up the winding stone staircase to the topmost battlement of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way down narrow cobbled streets to the Thieves ' Market , and we took a bus ride to the Crispo Lupus Windmill Plantation . There is little to see on that barren hilltop  --  a tangle of copper wire and seven or eight rusting steel towers with broken windmill sails . Not one watt of electricity was ever generated by the project . But I knew this little excursion would be a treat for the Crimms . Back home they could entertain their friends with the story of how they had ridden on a ramshackle bus in a tropical country  --  with pigs and chickens aboard ! <p> We inspected the bushes at the National Arboretum , running mostly to prickly , grayish xerophytic scrub . We toured the Arses Lupus Mask and Wig Factory downtown . We admired the slavering ferocity of the women gnawing on leather ( to soften it ) at the Arses Lupus Belt and Purse Co-op . We descended ( watch your head ! ) into the dark , dripping dungeons of Melanoma Prison , now a horror museum complete with shackled skeletons artfully laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that infamous hole you will need a candle , on sale at the reception desk for fifty pilmiras . Luckily , I had my own penlight , and the alert Crimms neatly got around the fee by exchanging some little foil-wrapped bricklets of butter ( lifted from the hotel buffet ) for their candles . <p> Then once again out into the shimmering light of day , and under a sky of that heartbreaking shade of delft blue you will find nowhere else in the world , we took a pleasant stroll along the bayfront promenade . We ate flavored ices and watched the children clubbing rat fish in the shallows . <p> Jason was fascinated by the Viborran coins , light as fine pastry . ( Even the money is fun in Viborra ! ) I explained that they are minted from a curious alloy of chalk and aluminum , or actually baked , on greased sheets , in government kilns , and that , unlike all other coins in the world , they float . The 500-pilmira pieces are particularly buoyant , and these huge gray discs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusty surface somewhat like that of a butterfly 's wing . This creepy feeling or quality of dry slipperiness is held in great esteem by Viborrans , and they have a word for it  --  rhampa , which translates not only as " free of asperities " but also as " charm , " " magic , " " felicity , " " a leap of the heart , " " brutal cunning , " " inner certitude , " or " a sudden white spikiness , as of a yawning cat 's mouth , " according to context . If you wish to say " Thank you " or " Is it not so ? " or " Beat it ! " or " The bill , please , " you can never go far wrong with the all-purpose phrase " Ar rhampa palayot , " delivered with a servile bob of the head . <p> " Our free tub ride ! " Mopsy cried out , as she looked at her watch . " It 's almost noon ! Are we far from the tub docks ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her against using such derisory terms as " tub " and " bucket " around the fishermen . These proud fellows do not laugh at jokes about their small leather coracles  --  called moas . Mopsy had her coupon ready . Through clever booking  --  all their trips are planned in detail a year in advance  --  the Crimms had received from Tessair a free bottle of skin lotion and a book of valuable coupons , one of which entitled them to a free moa ride in Viborra Bay on any weekday before noon , between April 20 and December 5 . <p> Hearty singing told us that the fishing fleet was coming in  --  and with a good catch ! The little round vessels , painted in soft pastel colors and decorated with painted human eyes , gyrated and jostled against one another like bumper cars at the fair as the men struggled to bring them in against the current . Steering a moa , or indeed making it go at all , in a particular direction is a difficult art to master . <p> And noon is not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moa out into the Burning Sea . The sun at meridian is a fearful thing in Viborra . We paddled frantically and our goatskin craft kept spinning around and around in place . There was no breeze . Stinging sweat blurred our vision . ( But nights can turn cool in Viborra , so be sure to pack a sweater or light wrap . ) Still , you must make the effort , because the only proper way to see the Melanoma Memorial is from the sea . <p> This is a colossal equestrian statue of the late President Eutropio Melanoma , rising up against a cobalt sky at the end of a long mole , or breakwater . Fabricated of ferro-concrete on site , and standing as high as a nine-story building , it commemorates the long rule ( more than forty years ) of the beloved old President . It is a robust , lumpy work ( what one art critic has called " the apotheosis of portland cement " ) , and a grand tribute to the man 's political genius and " The Year of the Edict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year of Decision . " The horse is rearing up in a fine capriole , and the presidential sword ( giver of victory ) is pointed out to sea . A black rubber raven ( bird of prophecy ) is perched on his shoulder . <p> The old President was elected over and over again by acclamation and is still fondly remembered here for his disheveled hair and clothing , for his dramatic and alternating acts of mercy and cruelty , and for the mischievous teasing of his ministers , some of whom he made give their reports while running alongside his moving Packard , with the window glass only partly rolled down . He also undertook to teach lawyers humility , giving his Supreme Court justices the choice of working for three months of the year in the nitrate mines or serving for three months on road-repair crews , wearing red vests and flagging traffic . <p> At the Cafe Tessa , a waterfront bar where dissident jugglers and poets meet to grumble and conspire , you will hear that it was the old man 's simple tastes in food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . One of his favorite amusements was to prowl stealthily about the grounds of the presidential mansion with a garden hose , squirting water on cats and servants , and taking gopher colonies by surprise with sudden inundations of their little underground apartments . At night , after a light supper of a single warmed-over bean cake , he liked to retire to the ballroom for an hour or so of running his fist up and down the white keys of a piano . <p> Something of a prodigy , Melanoma consolidated his power early on , as quite a young man , by disposing of all likely claimants to the office of chief executive . His father and his infant sons he garroted personally . With his brothers , uncles , and nephews , for whom he felt less natural affection , he was more severe , condemning each of them to a protracted , popeyed death in leather harness , dragging ore carts out of the nitrate pits . But he had overlooked someone in his planning , and so the Melanoma era came to an appalling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only legitimate daughter , Arses Melanoma Lupus , plunged a white-hoc poker into the sunken belly of the ascetic old man . The puncture was mortal . Arses 's husband , Crispo Lupus , then succeeded to the presidency , after a brief scuffle with guards on the veranda of the mansion . <p> Elderly firebrand poets at the Cafe Tessa , whose subsidies were sharply cut back by the new administration , will tell you that Crispo Lupus lacks rhampa and a masterly hand ; that he neglects his duties ; that he is not a man of bold strokes , of deeds you could sing . They say he does nothing but fool about with his hunting birds , leaving the much feared Arses in full and very active command at the mansion . Under the Lupus regime , the poets say , the people of Viborra have actually become shorter and uglier , and everybody 's hair has gone all gummy . Whatever the truth of the matter , it is certain that Lupus has never captured the hearts of his countrymen in the way hat Melanoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the listings in the telephone directory were alphabetized . <p> Anyone can direct you to the cafe Tessa , which is situated near the base of the natural rock pinnacle known as the Needle of Desolation , and just around the corner from another downtown landmark , the Arses Lupus Black Pavilion , or the Dark Hall of the People . This very modern structure , with lots and lots of darkish glass , is something of a barren shaft itself , rising up in bleak splendor under the gentian bowl of the sky . The thing fairly takes your breath away , and in Chick Jardine 's humble opinion there is nothing in New York to touch it for sharp angularity of line and blankness of aspect . <p> It is here , in the spacious atrium of the Hall , that Carnival season begins each year with the auction of public offices and preferments . Nimmo Lupus , the playboy son of Crispo and the imperious Arses , presides over the bidding in the red silk robes of Grand Chamberlain , to which is affixed the golden sunburst badge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these state occasions by his youngest son , Bungo Lupus , a cute toddler , who , all decked out in a little policeman 's uniform , sits dozing on his father 's knee . One frequent bidder told me that he took the limp Bungo at first for a dummy ! The poets say that Bungo has the same weak eyes as Nimmo . <p> So  --  Carnival in Viborra . Should you go ? Yes , but be prepared for something a little different . The revels in Viborra proper are nothing at all like those in Rio and New Orleans . There are no gala parades or balls . The people simply go out at night wearing dog masks or dog helmets and mill about in darkness and eerie silence . They take measured steps and move in slow tidal fashion up and down the narrow cobbled streets . Now and then they stop and look at one another , nose to nose , without speaking , rather like dogs , for some little time . And when the shuffling stops  --  such stillness ! The ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been unable to find out when or how it started , or just what the point of it is . The Long March of the Dogs , they call it , though there is no canine friskiness about the thing ; it is really more like a shambling procession of cattle . Bring comfortable walking shoes . Leave your dog helmets and dog masks at home , as they will only be confiscated at the airport . Only those made in Viborra ( with longish snouts ) and certified by the Central Committee can be worn in the March . <p> Things are livelier , of course , across the Bal in transpontine Viborra , where , every night at midnight , there is the celebrated Stampede of the Drunks , around and around the Plaza of Louts . It is not for everyone , this stumbling , boisterous race , but to say you have run with the international drunks on the River Bal  --  well , take it straight from Chick Jardine , few travel claims confer more prestige these days . Your application for the Stampede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee , must be made to the Central Committee six months in advance . <p> All other events are open to the public . Everyone ( with orange bracelet ) can join in the frolic around the fountain and in the reflecting pool and along the narrow cobbled streets radiating out from the Nimmo Arch . Wear casual clothes . Beware the melon ambush . Take care when rounding corners or you are likely to have a watermelon or some rotten and unfamiliar vegetable smashed down on your head  --  with what seems to me unnecessary force . Stay well clear of those roving gangs of hooded urchins who call themselves the Red Ants ; they will seize you and gag you and truss you up and scrawl Red Ant slogans across your belly and then toss you about on a stretched bull hide . Keep a sharp lookout for boulders and burning tires rolling down the hillside streets . There is a certain amount of capering around bonfires . After the first night the streets are littered with putrefying vegetable fragments . There are one or two deaths each night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years the season has been spoiled a bit by nightly typhoons , which are sometimes followed by predawn tsunamis . The poets claim that something has gone wrong with the prevailing winds , and they blame the unholy Arses and her practices in necromancy . Despite this , the merrymakers still come in swarms , and I must caution you that there is a lot of shameless overbooking in Viborra during Carnival . You may be forced to double up in your hotel room with unsavory strangers , and sleep in shifts . " Hot bunking , " as we call it in the trade . Three years ago , I am informed , the Morono Palace was so jam-packed with louts that the hotel itself subsided eight : and a half inches into the mud . <p> Poor Mopsy was ready to drop . it was just after one in the morning and we were weary and stuffed . We were fairly waterlogged with oysters . But we still had a gratis supper coming , and the dining hall at the Pan-Lupus did n't open until 2:00 A.M. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viborra before about 2:30 A.M. This by way of showing you do not have to rise early . ) <p> What to do ? Fighting off sleep , and determined not to be done out of any meal that was due us , we gave each other playful slaps and dashed cold water in our faces . We went to the bar to kill some time and found it filled with English travel writers in suede shoes and speckled green suits . What a scene ! They were laughing and scribbling and asking how to spell " ogive " and brazenly cribbing long passages of architectural arcana from their John Ruskin handbooks , which are issued with their union cards . <p> " Look , that sod Jardine is here too ! " one of them shouted . Then he and the others came crowding around , seething with bitter envy of me and my Chick 's Wheel of Adjectives , a handy rotating cardboard device , which , at $24.95 , was such a super hit with the travel journalists at our winter conference in Macao . Mopsy feared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaped childish ridicule on my cluster of lapel pins , tokens of numerous professional honors . A serene and scornful smile soon sent them reeling back in confusion . <p> We left them there , stewing in resentment and muttering over their pink gins , and ac two on the dot we were standing first in line outside the dining-hall doors . From campaniles all over town the bells of Viborra were striking the hour , with paired thuds and thumps of slightly different pitch . I was explaining how these strange dead bells are cast from a curious alloy of pumice and zinc when Mopsy silenced me with a raised hand . <p> " No  --  listen , " she said . " Those  --  bells . They seem somehow to know we 're off tomorrow on the morning Fokker . They seem to be  --  saying something . " <p> " But I do n't understand , " said Jason . " How do you mean , Mopsy ? Just what is it they  --  seem to say ? " <p> " Those  --  sounds on the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem to say . ' Come back , Mopsy ! Come back , Jason ! Come back , Chick ! Come back to the sparkling shores of the Burning Sea ! Come back in time to a more gracious and all but forgotten way of life in the enchanting old city of Viborra nestled snugly in a sapphire cove ' neath the vast rotunda of an indigo sky ! " <p>
