Things seemed just perfect for Robert L. Johnson last week . His BET Holdings Inc. ( 1996 sales : $133 million ) , the nation 's foremost black media conglomerate , posted its 13th consecutive quarterly profit increase . As the cash floods in , Johnson is living a media god 's life . He has built a mirrored glass-and-steel headquarters in a poor neighborhood of Washington and acquired a lavish 133-acre horse farm in Virginia hunt country . He has also planned to buy the company and offered shareholders a deal that values BET at $800 million . His concept : transform BET 's golden logo into the pre-eminent brand name for African Americans by stamping it on everything from restaurants to credit cards , apparel and magazines . <P> Perhaps the week was too perfect . Some of Wall Street 's wheels think Johnson is trying to get BET on the cheap , and they are demanding a price that matches the value inherent in BET 's mix of **25;5823;TOOLONG programming and access to 50 million households , a combination that has made it one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that BET could be worth almost 50% more than Johnson is offering . " It 's such a fabulous company that I see Johnson 's offer as nothing more than preliminary , " says Mario Gabelli , a high-profile media investor who complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission ; other holders sued BET directly . <P> Johnson , who controls a majority of BET 's voting stock , now has a thorny problem : sweetening his offer will siphon capital from BET 's planned expansion . On the other hand , since he has essentially put the company up for sale , a failure to raise the bid might tempt deep-pocketed media giants like NBC or Disney to make a bid . Johnson is adamant that he wo n't cede control . Says he : " I will not give up my stake . Never . Why should I , when I can make this company grow so much larger ? " <P> Rags-to-riches stories do n't come any better than Robert Johnson 's . The ninth of 10 children , he grew up poor in Freeport , Ill. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable-industry lobbyist . He founded BET in 1980 with $15,000 in borrowed money , convinced he could mine gold from ore that others had found less rich . Marketers have known forever that black consumers have a ton of money at their disposal  --  $425 billion annually  --  and are quality conscious and extremely brand loyal . Johnson not only created a brand , BET ( Black Entertainment Television ) , but in TV he also found an ideal way to reach the target audience . <P> BET shows are an eclectic if often insipid mix of music videos , infomercials and reruns of sitcoms such as Sanford and Son , along with talk and news shows produced in-house . But the programming comes dirt cheap . Profit margins currently run in the 50% range , in contrast to about 35% for many cable companies . The network already reaches 98% of all black cable homes , so future growth will have to come from new ventures . For example , the BET on Jazz cable channel , which features live performances , has more than 2 million domestic and 300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
