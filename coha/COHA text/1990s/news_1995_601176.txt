<p> The way baby boomers grew up made comfort a cliche . The way they grow old will make history because millions of the most privileged generation wo n't ever have enough money to retire . <p> The oldest boomers turn 50 next year , and for many the looming question is not when they 'll retire , but if they can . <p> Millions will have to work eight , 10 or more years beyond the traditional retirement age . Social Security benefits are almost certain to be cut . Pensions are at risk . <p> Yet they still are n't saving . <p> Four in 10 set aside less than $ 1,000 last year , according to a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll . At the same time , two-thirds expect to live as well  --  or better  --  in retirement as they do today . <p> " I do n't think the nation as a whole understands the immensity of the situation that 's going to unfold at the beginning of the 21st century , " says Don Sauvigne , head of IBM 's retirement programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire in 2011 , they will need about $ 1 million in savings to ensure an annual income equivalent to about $ 50,000 throughout retirement . And that assumes Social Security benefits and pensions are n't cut . <p> " People underestimate how long they 'll live . They underestimate how much of that time they might be ill . They overestimate how much money they 'll have , " says Barbara Casey , president of Dreyfus Retirement Services . <p> Adds Steven Vernon , author of Do n't Work Forever and retirement practice director at Watson Wyatt Worldwide , a benefits consulting firm : " If you 're saving less than $ 1,000 and you ask the question at what age will you be able to retire , the answer will probably be well beyond death . " <p> Retirement on shaky legs <p> Baby boomers  --  the 76 million people born from 1946 through 1964  --  have taxed the nation 's social institutions all their lives . <p> As children , they strained schools . As young adults , they flooded the job market . When they started buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's : day care , physical fitness , low-fat food . <p> Demographers liken them to a pig moving through a python . <p> Now the concern is retirement , and for many the wake-up call will come too late . <p> If they have n't started saving yet , boomers who turn 50 next year can forget about retiring at 65 . <p> " There 's no possible way for most people to make it up between now and retirement , " says Byron Oliver , president of Cigna Retirement and Investment Services . " People are going to have second careers . People are going to work for 10 years , maybe more , beyond what we think of as normal retirement . " <p> In many ways , the bleak outlook for baby boomers ' retirement comes as no surprise . <p> For years , experts have known that boomers ' sheer numbers would crack the cornerstone of retirement income  --  Social Security . <p> And economists long have lamented the USA 's falling savings rate  --  about 4% of income now vs. 11% in the 1950s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the widespread threat to company pensions , which typically replace 15% to 20% of pre-retirement income . <p> Companies , in their quest to beat low-cost global competitors , are unloading retirement responsibility onto their workers . Increasingly , company savings plans are replacing traditional pensions as the main source of retirement income . <p> Congress , too , has unwittingly undermined pensions . In its efforts to cut the budget deficit , Congress limited tax breaks for that experts still are only guessing at the full impact on boomers ' retirement . But most agree pension benefits almost certainly will shrink . <p> " The pension and retirement system in America is headed for disaster , " says Lawrence Weinbach , chairman of the Committee for Economic Development , a group of 250 top corporate executives and university presidents . Last week , the committee urged Congress to roll back complex regulations and funding limits on company retirement plans . <p> The upshot is this : For the first time , all three legs of the retirement-income stool  --  Social Security , company pensions and personal savings  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many boomers , regardless of income , are like a couple who came to see Honolulu financial planner Harry Kasanow : They were in their late 40s , grossed $ 300,000 a year , had three children in private school , no retirement savings and no college savings . Kasanow put them on a strict plan , and they saved $ 14,000 in a year . But then they wanted to spend the money on a family trip to Europe . " I basically had to slap them around , say , ' Wake up here , ' " Kasanow says . <p> " Nobody wants to think about retiring . It sounds so mortal , " says Bob Rich , 33 , of New Paltz , N.Y . He and his wife , Dawn , started their retirement planning three years ago when their daughter was born . <p> On the surface , they appear to be in good shape : Last year , they earned $ 104,000 and saved $ 11,000 for retirement . But only $ 3,000 came out of their paychecks . The balance was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They just started making monthly contributions to a mutual fund  --  a habit crucial to building a nest egg . <p> " Putting away money regularly is hard to do , even though it may not be that you 're scrimping to do it , " Bob says . He and Dawn have a constant tug-of-war between paying off credit cards or saving for retirement . <p> And how much is enough ? " It 's like trying to shoot for a moving target . You do n't know what the future will bring , " says Bill Wise , 31 , of Greensboro , N.C. <p> But Wise , who sells computer equipment to hardware stores and home centers , has been prudent . He saves at least 10% of his $ 52,000 salary a year and plans to increase that so he has $ 1 million when he retires . <p> Whether they 're savers or spenders , baby boomers ' retirement predicament is n't completely of their making . They 're beset by a unique set of real and emotional demands that have left them labeled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between their children 's college funds and their parents ' old-age expenses . <p> Across the nation , a low-level anxiety about retirement courses through the population . Three in 4 worry they wo n't have enough money to live comfortably in retirement , according to the poll . <p> When Steve Farkas of Public Agenda told focus groups last year he wanted to talk about retirement , he was met with blank stares . People who had been leaning forward waiting to learn the topic sank back in their seats . Some rolled their eyes . <p> Then someone shared an experience or a fear  --  turning 40 , sending a child to college , watching parents age . Slowly , others engaged . The discussions " tapped underlying anxieties , " Farkas says . <p> Baby boomers are right to be anxious . Retirements are crumbling . <p> Social Security <p> The Social Security trust fund will be broke by 2030 , just as the last of the baby boomers near retirement age . Two workers will be supporting every retiree , compared to 3.3 workers now and 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But few experts believe Congress will let Social Security run out of money . Instead , lawmakers will keep the system solvent by raising taxes and cutting benefits . Eventually , many predict , the program could become a safety net for retirees with nothing else . <p> Already , the system is being scaled back : <p>  --  The age at which people can collect full Social Security benefits is going up  --  to 66 in 2005 and 67 in 2022 . Many believe Congress will raise the age to 70 . <p>  --  Since 1994 , taxes have been levied on 85% of Social Security benefits paid to couples with income greater than $ 44,000 and singles with income greater than $ 34,000 . Before , 50% of benefits were taxed . <p> Social Security is the main source of income for 42% of retirees , according to a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and Mathew Greenwald &; Associates . Average 1995 benefit : $ 698 a month . <p> Most people do n't think the current system will survive . <p> The USA TODAY poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the current level ; a third say they 'll get nothing . <p> These days , many financial advisers do n't even bother to include Social Security in their clients ' retirement plans . <p> " If it comes in , let 's look at it as another vacation , another golf outing . But it 's gravy , " says New York financial planner Peter Palion . <p> Pensions <p> A traditional pension promises lifetime retirement income for long-time employees . That promise is in danger of being broken for millions of baby boomers . <p> About 1 in 4 pensions has promised more benefits than it can pay , and companies can change their promises for future pension benefits with just 15-days notice . <p> In the 1980s alone , companies dropped almost 40,000 pension plans . Kmart joined the list last month . As of Jan. 31 , 1996 , benefits for 180,000 employees will be frozen , and the plan will be closed to new workers . Instead , the retailer will make annual contributions to employees ' retirement accounts based on its profits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater interest in the retailer 's overall performance . But the shift also could save the company money : Last year , it contributed $ 64 million to its pension plan . If the profit sharing plan had been in place , it would have put in $ 30 million . <p> Some experts fear other companies will follow Kmart 's example as baby boomers near retirement . That 's because Congress , to reduce the budget deficit , has forced companies to delay pension contributions until later in workers ' careers , rather than allowing contributions throughout . <p> Pension contributions are n't taxed . So by forcing companies to put less money into their plans in recent years , the government collected more taxes . <p> For companies that have enjoyed so-called " funding holidays , " the bill will start coming due in eight or nine years . At that point , company contributions will have to jump an average of 60% if firms are going to cover benefits promised to baby boomers , says Sylvester Schieber , head of research for Watson Wyatt . <p> " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future , are either not going to be willing or not going to be able to meet them , " Schieber says . <p> Those firms will cut benefits or kill their pension plans outright . Especially vulnerable : industries facing global competition with tight profit margins and a low-skilled , nonunion workforce  --  such as retailing and health care  --  or shrinking industries such as aerospace . <p> Baby boomers , especially younger ones , sense that pension promises might be too good to be true : The poll found 36% do n't expect to get all the pension benefits their companies are projecting . Among boomers younger than 40 , that leaps to 43% . <p> The regulatory maze governing pensions has led many small companies to drop their pension plans in favor of 401(k) savings plans , in which employees invest their own money . And firms that previously offered no retirement plans have added 401(k)s instead of pensions . <p> The trouble is that at least a quarter of employees who have 401(k)s do n't contribute to them . And experts say that those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed-income accounts and money market funds that barely keep pace with inflation . 401(k) accounts typically earn 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points less a year than professionally managed accounts . <p> Savings <p> So how are baby boomers preparing for the coming retirement crisis ? By and large , they 're doing nothing . <p> They continue to spend as though they want to work forever . Almost a third saved nothing last year , the USA TODAY poll found . <p> " It 's a classic state of denial , " says Joseph Seymour , head of retirement planning at Quest for Value , a mutual fund company . <p> A fairly typical baby boomer  --  someone earning $ 50,000 a year who saves 4% of income , earns 6% on investments and will get an average pension  --  will have to work until age 73 to have enough money to sustain his lifestyle in retirement , says Vernon of Watson Wyatt . <p> To change that , baby boomers need to triple their savings , says Stanford economist B. Douglas Bernheim , who studied the issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because it assumes that Social Security benefits wo n't be cut and taxes wo n't go up . <p> But Bernheim 's calculations also are controversial because he does n't count the value of baby boomers ' homes as savings . If homes are included , baby boomers are saving about 80% of what they need . <p> Bernheim says he excludes homes because polls show that baby boomers want to live in their homes after they retire , not sell them . Today 's elderly feel the same way . <p> It is possible , of course , that baby boomers might behave differently than past generations . They often have . And they might have to tap their home equity for income because they have so little else . <p> Financial institutions are counting on that . More are offering reverse mortgages , which let retirees stay in their homes while using the equity to cover living expenses . When homeowners die or move , the homes usually are sold to pay back the bank . <p> " The aging-in-place preference seems to be very strong , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's largest mortgage company . " There will be more flexibility in managing the equity a family has . " <p> Stocks and bonds <p> But even boomers who believe they 've saved enough to avoid reverse mortgages might be shocked when they start cashing in their stocks and bonds . <p> John Shoven , dean of Stanford University 's School of Humanities and Sciences , projects a 20% decline in asset prices  --  stocks , bonds , real estate  --  from 2010 to 2020 as enormous numbers of baby boomers simultaneously sell investments for income . That would be similar to the bear market of the 1970s . <p> " The question that begs to be answered is who is going to be buying the assets that the pension funds are selling and at what prices ? " Shoven says . The bright side : Generation Xers will be able to get bargains on stocks and bonds for their retirement accounts . <p> Surprisingly , baby boomers learned their poor savings habits from their parents  --  the World War II generation venerated for their thrifty ways . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents did at their age , according to a Brookings Institution study . <p> So how is it that parents of many boomers are enjoying comfortable retirements ? Luck , mostly . <p> Strong economic growth pushed up pay during the older generation 's working years . Because Social Security and private pension benefits are based largely on earnings , they increased as pay increased . <p> And the value of their homes skyrocketed when millions of baby boomers started competing to buy them . Houses account for more than half of the wealth of people close to or past retirement age , says the Congressional Budget Office . <p> Baby boomers ca n't count on that appreciation because the generation that follows them is much smaller . Still , the recent influx of immigrants  --  and their eagerness to become homeowners  --  should keep home prices stable , economists say . <p> Even so , the stereotypical retirement of golfing and fishing may never be a reality for most boomers . More than three-quarters say they 'll work part-time after they retire . <p> That might not be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established in 1935 , people who reached age 65 typically lived another 13 years . Now , they live 17 more years . <p> Some baby boomers will want to work ; many others will have to . <p> " The nation is going to need the skills of that older part of the workforce , " says Sauvigne of IBM , which this year changed its pension plan to encourage people to work until they 're older . <p> Baby boomers , says futurist Ken Dychtwald , are faced with " the dream of all history  --  the chance to live a long life . The chance to live decades after our 40th birthday . " <p> But , " There 's no free ride . " <p> Why the three pillars of retirement are wobbly Company retirment plans , personal savings and Social Security are the three key components of a comfortable retirement . But baby boomers are in trouble in each area . Part of the blame falls to Congress . <p> Since the 1920s , Congress has permitted individuals and companies to avoid or delay income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their efforts to cut the federal budget deficit , lawmakers are chipping away at tax breaks that encourage retirement saving . And the cornerstone of retirement income in the past  --  Social Security  --  is projected to run out of money just as the largest groups of baby boomers begin to retire . <p> Company retirement plans <p> 1982 : Congress cut the maximum pension that can be paid to retirees each year . It now stands at $ 120,000 , down from the old maximum of $ 136,425 . Lawmakers also cut the maximum that employers and employees can put in a 401(k) savings plan each year  --  to $ 30,000 or 25% of pay , whichever is less . Old maximum : $ 45,475 . <p> 1986 : Congress limited individuals ' 401(k) contributions to $ 7,000 a year  --  now $ 9,240 after increases for inflation . Even with that limit , employees ca n't put in more than 25% of pay . It also capped contributions for most people who now make more than $ 66,000 a year . Lawmakers want to ensure that 401(k) plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid income taxes . <p> 1987 : Congress barred companies from considering expected pay increases and years of service when putting money in pension plans for future retirees . Lawmakers wanted to prevent companies from building pension surpluses , then terminating the plans to get the excess money . But the law shifted pension funding to late in baby boomers ' careers . Some experts fear many companies will end their pension plans rather than make the huge contributions needed for baby boomers . <p> 1993 : Congress cut the maximum amount of pay  --  to $ 150,000 from $ 235,840  --  that can be counted when funding pensions and making 401(k) contributions . At first glance , that would appear to hurt only people earning more than $ 150,000 . But when combined with a separate IRS rule that caps contributions to 401(k)s , the people hardest hit are those who earn just bit more than $ 66,000 . <p> 1994 : Slowed the growth of 401(k) contributions . The maximum employee contribution and salary at which people are considered highly paid had been adjusted each year for inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest $ 500 and the salary cutoff is rounded down to the nearest $ 5,000 . The effect : That cut this year 's maximum contribution by $ 200 and the salary cutoff by $ 1,430 . <p> Savings <p> 1981 : Congress said everyone could take a $ 2,000 tax deduction for contributing to an Individual Retirement Account . <p> 1985 : IRA tax deductions peaked at $ 38.2 billion . <p> 1986 : Congress limited deductions for IRA contributions to people without pensions or who earn less than $ 50,000 for couples and $ 35,000 for singles . <p> 1993 : IRA deductions plummetted to $ 8 billion . <p> 1995 : House passes an IRA proposal that would eliminate taxes and penalties for people who use the money before retirement to pay for a first home , college or medical expenses . Senate action is expected this summer . <p> Social Security <p> 1983 : Congress raised Social Security taxes to build a surplus to cover baby boomers ' retirement benefits . Social Security actuaries predicted the surplus would last until 2063 , when the youngest baby boomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , the age for collecting full Social Security benefits will go to 66 from 65 . <p> 2013 : Social Security will pay out more in retirement benefits than it collects in payroll taxes , according to Social Security trustees . The system will have to spend interest earnings to cover benefits . <p> 2019 : Social Security will exhaust interest earnings and tap the trust fund , trustees say . <p> 2022 : Age for collecting full Social Security benefits will go to 67 . <p> 2030 : With baby boomers now aged 66-84 , Social Security will run out of money , the trustees project . That 's long before 2063 because people are living longer , they 're having fewer babies and their pay is not going up as much as expected in in 1983.
