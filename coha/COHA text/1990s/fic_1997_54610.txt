from Citizens Review <p> Then there was the police chief 's daughter , always bad news . Like tonight  --  another roasting summer night , air conditioners not quite keeping up  --  she sat alone at the bar , tapping her chipped fingernails against a glass . She took a last drag on the cigarette the fag gave her , a lousy , tasteless , low-tar wimp of a cigarette . Drag on a fag . Fag in drag . She giggled . " They sure got that right . " She said it out loud in a deep voice . Then she said it again , squeaky falsetto . " They sure got that right . " Everybody said that phrase these days , but what did it mean ? You were always supposed to know these things but she was never sure she did . So kill me , she thought . She tugged at the hem of her shirt , yanking the plunging neckline into a deeper V. <p> She drummed her knuckles on the bar . Fidget , fidget , fidget . Thuse had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children do n't fidget , other children never fidget , fidgeting children burn in hell . Like maybe she 'd have rather had a cripple for a kid , at least it would n't fuckin ' fidget . " Fidget , fidget , fidget , " she said out loud , then she giggled . It was so weird to hear her mother 's old warning in here , with raunchy music blasting and couples necking , just the kind of place her mother would rather die than he in . " Fidget , fidget , fidget . " Even weirder to hear the words without her father 's inevitable retort . " Who 's a fidget ? " She mocked his voice , a tight baritone swallowed down into her glass , doubling in on itself in a liquidy echo . She giggled . " Not my little gi-irl ! " By then she 'd have climbed up on his lap to start a long galloping horsy ride on his knee , while her mother clucked her tongue and faded away . That 's how Francie Lou remembered it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paltry substance of her becoming wispier and wispier until she was transparent and , finally , invisible . But no , she must have simply walked off somewhere to pray , to pray for Francie Lou 's pathetic little soul . Nowadays she seemed to have let up on prayer , thank God . Francie Lou giggled . " Thank God . " What a rip . " My little gi-irl ! " She sang the words over the rim of the glass , which was empty now . <p> She turned and yelled to her boyfriend , who was down at the end of the bar . " Hey , Eddie , how about let 's dance now ? In this lousy light , dwarfed by the guy next to him , Eddie looked washed-out and puny . She wished she had n't noticed . <p> " Yeah , in a minute , " he said , his voice not only fiat but just this side of annoyed . Annoyed at who ? <p> It pissed her off , him standing there , skinny and blank , talking with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paunch , ten years older than them at least , wearing an earring and tight jeans . He had to be a fag . Could n't Eddie even see that ? Nope . All he saw was a connection . Eddie and his fucking connections , like he 'd just about stumble into an investor in this dive . He 'd taken one lousy business course at the community college and figured himself a wheeler-dealer , as if there was anything there to wheel and deal except some half-baked idea he had about bungee jumping from the old railroad bridge . Who 'd buy that ? But this fag bragged about a weekend house somewhere out past Woodstock , and Eddie pictured bucks . Open your eyes , Eddie , Christ , the guy 's cheap as sawdust , even she could tell . God , making such a production buying them a couple of drinks . <p> She slid sideways off the stool , wobbled , and steadied herself with one hand on the seat . She felt for the hem of her shirt , as if that was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in things . The shirt ended a couple of inches above the waistband of her little skirt , exposing a section of her midriff . She rubbed the slippery synthetic fabric between her thumb and forefinger , then patted her bare skin : firm , flat , cool . Her skin was always silky smooth and cool , even on the beach , even making love . <p> " Eddie , c'm on ! " she called out to him . For a second he seemed to look toward her , but then he sideswiped eye contact , never breaking from the nodding assent with which he listened to the other guy . <p> Once she was on her feet , the thumping bass of the music took hold of her . With both palms flat against her cool belly , she dipped and swayed her shoulders and then her hips , took a step , then another , dipped and swayed , took a step , and undulated her way slowly toward the end of the bar , squeezing between couples who talked and danced , dancing sexy by herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the fag 's , rolling it around there . He pushed and rolled right back . Well , what d' ya know , she thought , giggling . Then she moved on to Eddie , butt to butt , and did a slow rotation , hinging her hip to his , until she was in his face . " Take me in your arms , " she warbled in no particular tune , " and dance with me-e-ee ! " <p> " Goddamn it , Francie Lou , I 'm talking ! " He put a hand on each of her shoulders and pushed her away . <p> In a split second she knew that he had pushed her angrily , right here for anyone to see , so he could keep talking to a fucking fag rather than hold her and dance close to her and feel the dry coolness of her skin against him . <p> She started to shove back at him , reaching her arms out to slam into his chest , but he grabbed her by the wrists , rough and tight so it stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie , that hurts ? <p> " Hey , hey , you two , take it easy ! " The guy from New Jersey put his big arm around her shoulder and with his eye on Eddie eased her slowly out from Eddie 's grasp as Eddie let up and finally let go . <p> " Bastard , " she muttered under her breath , massaging one wrist with the other hand . <p> The guy laughed and maneuvered her closer to the bar . " How about another drink , huh ? You 're ready for another . No point getting mad , we 're all here to have a little fun , right ? " <p> " Yeah , sure , right " she said , struggling up onto a stool . " Fun . Just loads and loads of fun . " She stared sullenly at the whiskey sour in front of her , then lifted it , eyed it more closely , and put back half of it in one gulp . Next to her , Eddie and the guy nursed along their beers . Fags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but she could n't unthink it now . <p> " Man , you got ta pay better attention to your lady friend , " the guy from New Jersey chided Eddie . <p> Eddie snorted . " Believe me , I pay plenty . Pay through the goddamn nose . " <p> Francie Lou scowled at him , but he was n't even looking . She finished off the drink in a second gulp . " Hey , " she tapped at the guy 's shoulder , " you got another cigarette ? " <p> He gave her a cigarette and lit it with a lighter that was trying to look like solid gold . Cheap , she thought . She took a deep drag , making sure the cigarette was lit okay , and blew the tasteless smoke up to the ceiling in perfect rings . " Thanks , buddy " <p> Then she slid off the stool , tugged her skirt down from where it had bunched around her ass , and stepped behind the guy and over to Eddie . " Hey , Eddie , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one quick move , sure at least that he was watching now , she held out her cigarette to focus his gaze , then shoved it down into his beer . <p> She turned and pushed through the crowd , past the dance floor , past the ladies ' room , which God knows she could have used , out the door , and into the parking lot and the sweltering , thick moonless night . The dank heat stopped her . It encircled her totally , as Eddie had not ; it licked her skin . She stood for a moment in the folds of humid air and peered through the murk in search of her car . Resting her hands against her cool midriff , she spotted the car , swayed , and goose-stepped her way to it . <p> Inside , she put the air conditioning on full blast , switched on the radio , turned up the volume , and peeled out of the driveway . Commercials blared , then oldies . An old Rolling Stones . Glimmers of distant lightning flashed above the Catskills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the highway to get to the old bridge into town , singing at the top of her lungs . " Do you ne-ed anybody , I just need someone to love ... " She laughed . Right . Love . She cursed Eddie , she cursed the balding fag and his awful cigarettes , she cursed everyone she 'd ever known who 'd gotten in her way , which was everyone she 'd ever known . " Do you ne-ed anybody ? " she shrieked along with the Beatles on the bridge . It felt good , damn it , sealed up in her air-conditioned old Mustang , cursing and singing far above the inky ripples of the river . " I get by with a little help from my friends , oh , I get high with a little help ... " Oh , but the words , for Chrissakes , she could n't stand the words . She groped around on the floor for a tape , found one , it did n't matter what it was , she threw it in the slot . Then she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear end of a Chevy stopped at the red light at the end of the bridge . <p> The thwonking smash of metal was brief . " Shit , " she hissed under her breath . She waited for the car to stop rocking before she inhaled . " Daddy is not gon na like this one bit , " she said to the air . She felt for her extremities , stretched her limbs , rolled her neck all around , and decided she had not been hurt . But the car . Shit . Nothing smouldered or spurted , at least ; there were n't any smells . But the front was shorter , its nose folded somewhere inside the back of the other car . The radio had stopped , the glove compartment had sprung open . She reached into it , felt around , and found a crumpled old cigarette pack with two flattened but whole cigarettes left in it . " My lucky day , " she muttered . <p> Francie Lou lit a cigarette , rolled down the window to toss the match , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A black woman 's face . She jumped , startled and afraid , and rolled up the window fast . Then a hand hit the window , and close behind it menaced that angry face . How could all of this possibly be happening to her at the same time ? Her heart thumped hard in her chest . Wake me up , she whispered , please wake me up . She stole a look back at the face , and as her glance traversed the scene , she took in the driver 's door hanging open in the smashed car in front of her . And then it dawned on her : this person was the other driver . <p> She rolled the window back down . " Christ , you scared me . " <p> The other woman spluttered . " I scared you ! You damn near kill me , you come plowing into me and wreck my car and nearly kill me dead and you do n't even bother to stir yourself and get out to see what you 've done and if anybody 's hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch ? <p> " I 'm sorry " Francie Lou forced herself to mumble the apology , not completely convinced yet that she was safe from harm here . <p> But the woman was n't satisfied , oh no , she had to go on and on . " just look at my car , will you ? Will you please look at it ! " <p> Francie Lou looked and thought it had n't been much of a car to begin with but decided not to say so . " The insurance 'll take care of it , " she said . " Do n't worry " <p> " I 'm stopped at a red light , big as life , dammit , and you .. , you .. , what ? What the hell is wrong with you ? Are you blind ? " <p> Francie Lou rolled her window up all but a crack . " I 'm sorry , lady , Jesus , you 'll get your money , it 'll get fixed , that 's what insurance is for , what the hell else do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gas station on the corner , and Francie Lou sat . All she had to do was wait for the cops to come , but waiting was hotter than hell . Still , she knew better than to start the car just for the air . She finished the first cigarette , which was stale but an improvement on those low-tar things she 'd just had . She waited , tapping her fingers on the steering wheel . Her bladder was ready to burst . She squirmed . Really ready to burst . She looked around ; the other driver was nowhere in sight . Nobody else either . So she opened the door carefully , got out , and scooted around to the curb . Then , hidden at least halfway by her own car , she squatted and peed onto the pavement . There was nothing else she could do but let go of a long gushing torrent that took forever . Damn good thing the streets were deserted in this God-forsaken neighborhood . Finished , she got back in the car and lit the second cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the cruiser pulled up , sirens blaring and lights flashing . <p> It was Sergeant Joe Schmidt , one of the old-timers . He looked in and smirked . " You again , " he said . " Lookie here , Al " he called out to his partner . Albert Santino crouched down and clicked his tongue . <p> " Why , Francie Lou , you bad girl , you . It seems like just last month  --  " <p> " It was last month . Okay ? Now will you just please call Daddy and let 's get this over with ? " <p> When the phone rang , he ran his hands through his headful of curls . To this very day , the chief 's auburn ringlets still made the ladies in the church remember him fondly as the pudgy , impish little boy he used to be , so long ago . Back then , their desire to believe in  --  and believe  --  a child of such cherubic looks gave him license to pawn off on other kids the blame for the bullying assaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on it : the mothers would sooner jump to unforgiving conclusions about the guilt of their own sons than impugn those red ringlets , those rosy full cheeks . Frankie Hudgins , the angel . <p> Back then , he liked waylaying kids down by the creek , hammering with both his fists until they gave him the bike or the money or the BB gun . If it was a good day , they 'd cry , too , and run home howling . Now , except for an occasional slug in the groin with someone really uncooperative , he generally talked his way through anything . A different sort of hammering , to be sure , but with basically the same results . <p> He was jowly now , his face broad and lumpy in the cheek . Any high color was from anger or surging blood pressure . Over the years his curls had become more brown , less red , and now they were flecked ever so slightly with gray , which the church ladies called distinguished . His poor little wife of twenty-some years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortures that left burning red splotches on her forehead and scalp , a merciless itch that went on sometimes for weeks . She could n't help be offended  --  resentful , even  --  that Frank got away with his gray . But what did n't he get away with ? He got away with gray . He got away with jowls . He even got away with short-sleeved shirts , letting the TV crews tape him without a jacket as he gloated over the latest drug bust , his unashamed bare workingman elbows planted firmly on a cluttered desk , the extreme abundance of freckles and the pale , soft , almost womanly flesh above those elbows right out there for everyone to see . How many times had it run on the five o'clock news , that image of Frank the freckly good guy , the cherub who 'd grown up to do his duty ? How often had that image been juxtaposed against shots of grim muscular dark men in undershirts and sweatpants , arms raised to shield their faces from the camera , as they were led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so accidentally reminiscent of the chain gang ? <p> " Again ? " he asked into the phone . " Again ? " he repeated . It was a word of confirmation rather than of questioning or shock or even anger . Chief Hudgins was never surprised to get a call about his daughter , though he was known to plunge his fingers deeper into his hair and clutch his temples in exasperation , especially if someone else in the department was in the room . In his line of work , of course , he had seen everything , but it was not just the hard reality of decades of police work that stole the surprise . No , in some strange way he actually looked forward to these calls : each new mishap only seemed to strengthen his grave and abiding disappointment in Francie Lou , a disappointment  --  unclouded by disapproval  --  that somehow satisfied him . The very dependability of its source , that inexhaustible spring of bad judgment , carelessness , lust , and self-preoccupation , fulfilled for him a certain pivotal expectation of family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Was anybody hurt ? " he asked next . " Okay , good . Who was in the other car ? " <p> He frowned as he listened . " Her ? The one who got brought in the other night ? Shit . No ... No ... Listen , forget it , we 'll take care of that one later . Just get the information , call the wrecker , whatever , tell the lady to start making her wish list and send her home in a cab ... Yes , right , a cab ... Then write out a summons for Francie Lou ... Yes , that 's right .. , right ... You got it . Yeah , yeah , sure , I 'm sorry your Breathalyzer is n't working tonight . " He laughed . " No ... yes ... a simple rear-end collision . And for Christ 's sake , keep it off page six . " <p> She had already waited while they called in to Daddy . She had watched them write out her ticket and make nice to the ranting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not let up , that one , until she went off , finally , in a taxi . Francie Lou thought it was over then . But just as the tow truck started to disengage the two cars , Sergeant Joe suddenly produced the Breathalyzer . <p> " No , " she whispered , incredulous . " Daddy said do the test ? " <p> Both officers nodded gravely . <p> " But he could n't have ! Why else ... " She let her voice trail off . Something was n't right . She tried to think . The wrecker , meanwhile , pulled slowly at the other car , which emitted a screech of grating metal , then yelped outright . <p> " Just like dogs , " said Albert Santino , folding his arms across his chest as he watched . " Y'know , we shoulda tried a bucket of cold water " <p> Both men chortled . <p> The Chevy staggered forward with one last high-pitched groan . The Mustang rocked a bit , then stilled . <p> " You 're trying to trick me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You wan na give Daddy a quick call and find out ? " <p> She sighed . When the game got this weird , when it crossed over to that fuzzy place where things could not be said , she was out there on her own . Shit . She was n't very good on her own . She pictured her father shaking his head at her in disgust . Daddy . She 'd have to go back home to him , because that 's where she lived . Even now , working off the DWI charge in the only way she knew how , she fought off the picture of him and the sound of his pissed-off whiny harangue . <p> Hurry up , hurry up , hurry up , she repeated to herself , sucking as hard as she could , bits of gravel piercing sharp into her bare knees . She grasped both of Joe 's thighs for balance . Hurry up , hurry up . Al , the first one , had been so much quicker . A car went by , its lights flickering into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a moment he stopped the frenzied pushing at the top of her head and checked that AI was waving the car on . But she kept going , faster , tighter , ignoring his gasping pleas to ease up . She worked her mouth in an urgent rhythm , aware of a staticky voice from the cruiser radio , then A1 answering . <p> " Christ , take it easy , " Joe hissed . <p> She did not take it easy , she did not slow down , she did not stop hurrying him up until Joe finally groaned and stumbled forward , almost knocking her over , and she counted the seconds in her mind , one-one-thousand , two-one-thousand , three-one-thousand , to keep from retching . Enough . She spat out the second mouthful . <p> He zipped and buckled , did not help her to her feet . Leaning against the cruiser , she picked out the gravel from her knees and shins . A1 finished at the radio . " Trouble on Main Street , " he called to Joe . " Backup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from the car as it started up . And they were gone . <p> The Mustang moved okay , the steering worked , there were no fumes , no red lights or flashing signals on the dash . She drove slowly to Broadway , then stopped at Stewarts to buy cigarettes . If only she knew where she was going next . Not to Eddie 's place , not after the way he treated her , she still had that much pride . But it was too late to barge in on Gloria or Deb , her only friends . And she was much too sober to go home and deal with her father , to listen to him rant at her or to hear him brush the whole thing off . Either way was disgusting . Icch . Like the bitter musty taste of cop still in her mouth . She needed something to get her through the rest of this . <p> She drove back down Broadway and parked by the riverfront , where places were still open and lots of people milled around , too hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , the partying roared full swing . She recognized guys she knew , but she had to lie low now , not get drawn in . From a pay phone she called Robert . His phone rang and rang and rang , and though she gave up hope , she let it keep ringing while she glanced around : Annie J 's ; Boat and Bottle ; Wing Shu Garden . Uh-uh . No question of scoring in one of these places , three blocks from the police station . <p> And then , just as she was about to hang up , Robert answered , his voice thick with sleep and growly with impatience . " Whatdya want ? " <p> " Robert , it 's Francie Lou . " <p> " Shit , I 'm asleep , man , it 's one fuckin ' thirty in the morning " <p> " I need something fast , " she said . " Whatever you got " <p> There was no answer , just the sound of a baby screaming in the back , his dumb wife hollering , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then muffled , then silent . But she knew he was back on . <p> " Robert ! " she called out . " Robert , I know you 're listening . I know there was a bust and that you must 've snitched first . I know they turn their backs when they let you in there " She did n't know any of this , but she was a pretty good guesser . He sure as hell did n't come by the stuff honest . <p> She waited through more screeching commotion in the background . Then he said , " You hear what 's going on here , Francie Lou ? I 'm a family man , for God 's sake . Christ , she argued with me for five fuckin ' minutes before she 'd let me even pick up the goddamn phone . " <p> Francie Lou sighed as emphatically as she could . " Listen , Robert . I really do n't have time for this . I 'm down in a parking space in front of Annie J 's . I just crashed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're gon na have to come here . But if you got something good , I got two hundred on me . " She took his silence as an answer . <p> " I 'm waiting for you , Robert , I 'm giving you fifteen minutes " She hung up . Then she got into her car , rolled down the windows , lit a cigarette , and waited . <p> What a pain , that Robert . Once he had been the kid in school who smelled . There always was one , here in the sticks . He 'd lived on a farm where his father was the hired hand , and even when he wriggled out of helping in the barn or in the fields ( and you always knew he wriggled out of anything he could ) , he 'd still carry the not-so-faint whiff of cow manure with him wherever he went , a pungency that permeated his clothes and his skin , stuck in dry clumps to the bottoms of his shoes . You could tell with your eyes closed the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of the kids liked him , anyway , so nothing held them back from heaping on the ridicule , not teachers , not school bus drivers , not common decency , and certainly not the meek presence of his mom or dad , who smelled , too ; shrieks and taunts were hurled at him as soon as he got anywhere . Francie Lou remembered howling and pinching her nose along with the rest of them . She remembered how much fun it was , as she sat fidgeting in her car on this hot night . <p> He did n't smell anymore . He had n't smelled of the farm for years . Probably right now she smelled even worse than him , sitting in this pool of sweat for God knows how long . But it still galled her to be indebted to someone who used to be the kid who smelled . Galled her more than being indebted to the snitching snake he had become . But really , who owed who ? She and Robert were locked into this weird dance , a high-stakes game with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to keep getting stuff , she could n't tell Daddy any of the shit she had on Robert , but to make sure she did n't tell , he 'd have to keep supplying , and on credit when that 's all she had . But if she did n't pay up , he 'd tell the chief she was his biggest customer ; if he told on her , she 'd tell Daddy he 'd stolen the stuff from his own busts . <p> She thought she had the highest card , she had him nailed : Daddy would have to put Robert away if anything came out , but he 'd never get rid of her . Leaning back in the car ( and something did smell oily , after all , shit , maybe a leak ? ) , she grinned to herself . Robert was the only game in town where she had clout . <p> But her smile faded . Deep down she sensed that Daddy knew everything . Must know Robert got paid off , this way and that . Must pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feed his daughter 's habit , which he only pretended not to know about ? She shuddered . No , impossible . She shuddered again . Yes , possible-as long as it was never said . Not a word . The ultimate collusion of hers and Robert 's , their silence , somehow played right into her father 's game , the real game . No , no , no , that was too farfetched . She closed her eyes and shook her head , as if to empty it . She wanted to stop thinking . But a thought surfaced anyway : her father needed them to do just what they did . A dance for three , that 's what it was . And not one of them could afford to have their cover blown . <p> " Hey , Francie Lou , wake up ! " <p> Robert had pulled his car up next to hers . He got out and opened her door . " Let 's take a little walk " He pointed to a bench facing the river , just past the gazebo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to feel better and Robert started to seem okay , a long-lost friend . <p> " No arrest ? Not even a DWI ? " he asked as he folded up his money and she put the little bag of coke into her purse . <p> " Uh-uh . Anyway , there was no reason to suspect . I mean , do I look drunk to you ? " Suddenly she sat up straight , crossed her ankles primly , frowned , and clutched her arms in front of her chest . It was as if a line of elastic running through all her muscles had been pulled tight . <p> Robert sniggered . " Right , sober as a judge . " <p> " Hah ! No judge in this town ! " She let the elastic go , fell back so she was half-lying on the bench , and convulsed with laughter , clutching her bare midriff . <p> " That 's one mean little stretch of road up there before the bridge , " he said . " Not so long ago , remember ? That lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school kids walking back from the skating rink . Remember ? And come to think of it , ai n't that where the off-duty trooper ran himself off and rolled over last month ? They did n't do no test on him , either . And what a shitload of flak there was for that . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So , I woulda thought they 'd be crackin ' down along there about now . Crackin ' down pretty hard . " <p> " So ? What are you trying to say , Robert ? " <p> He laughed . " So , what I 'm sayin ' is that it must be nice , to have cops , like , so understanding . " <p> " Oh , come off it , Robert " She burst into another long peal of laughter . " You got your ins more'n I do . Look at you . Christ , I have to do my daddy proud , I got this terrible , terrible weight on my shoulders , shit , while you 're out dealin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fine upstanding citizen ? ' <p> He snorted . " Well , you 're doin ' one hell of a job , Francie Lou . " <p> She laughed a string of long , dopey ripples . " Thank you so much . Y'know , that 's what I like about you , Robby , you say such nice things , I mean , you know how to make a girl feel appreciated . " Her voice dissolved again in giggles . She took another hit on the joint , then offered it to him . <p> He held up his hand , refusing . " You mean Eddie do n't ? " <p> " Oh , Christ . Eddie . Who brought him up ? " She sat up straight , suddenly seething mad . " Hanging with fags . Did you know that ? Over in Chick 's hanging with a guy who wears an earring . What does that make me , I wan na know ? What does that make me look like ? The bastard . Two years we 're together , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert laughed . " A wrecked car . A lousy habit . For starters . Not to mention you 're sittin ' here with me on a Saturday night . " <p> " Christ , sometimes I wish he was just out of my life . Out of my life for good . " <p> Robert laughed again . " Hey , just say the word . It can be arranged . " <p> She finished off the joint , then paused . " What can be arranged ? " <p> He sniggered . " Now what was it you just said ? " <p> She thought for a few seconds . " You mean ' out of my life . ' " <p> " For good . ' You said it . ' For good . ' " <p> She rolled her eyes and scowled . " Shit . I did n't mean that like that . " <p> " Hey , accidents happen all the time , Francie Lou . You know that . " <p> " Robert , stop it . I did n't mean that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His lip curled in a sneer . " Then watch who you say things to . " <p> She shuddered . " Christ , Robert . " She breathed out a long sigh , looked away from him , then looked back . Now he was grinning . " Christ , you 're weird . " <p> He laughed . " I 'm only joking , Francie Lou . Where 's your fuckin ' sense of humor ? " <p> " Right , joking , sure . " <p> " Lighten up , sweetheart . " <p> She scowled , then giggled . The giggle picked up , took in air , blew itself into a full gale of laughter . She gasped as she tried to speak . " Is that better ? " <p> " Yeah , that 's better " <p> " Okay , then drive me home now , okay ? " <p> It was as if she saw things through a telescope , as if they were brought closer from a great distance through long , narrow tubes : the driveway , the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and the six and the four , and the lonely doorknocker figurine of a poodle 's face right underneath . The real little dog who 'd shared her childhood got run over years before . " Poor Noodles , " she murmured , clutching the knob and bracing herself . Although every other house along this street of identical , well-manicured homes was wrapped in sleep and darkness , a pale orange light poured through gauzy drapes from every window of her parents ' house . <p> And when Francie Lou stepped into the living room , there they sat , staring at the TV , which was not even on , a thick , tense silence already filling up the vast space between the two of them . Her father was fully dressed , his white shirt gleaming , as if he were at work . Well , really he was at work , he was always at work , always in control everywhere , even in his sleep . If he ever did sleep , which she doubted . Had she ever seen him sleeping ? She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three o'clock in the morning was nothing for old Frankie . But her mother  --  now this was a real occasion , her being awake at this hour . Her face drained to a total yellowish pallor , she was lost inside some awful ancient flowery housecoat that must have been the wrong size even years ago , and her hair was wrapped in a faded piece of cloth . A surge of disgust rose into Francie Lou 's throat . Her mother looked like somebody 's cleaning lady . <p> They sat on widely separate chairs , stewing in their own separate turmoil . At first they seemed tiny and far away , but now they appeared through those long telescopic tubes of Francie Lou 's stoned vision and grew monstrously large . She squeezed her eyes shut . She 'd die if either of them spoke first . <p> " I 'm home " she announced . " I got a ride . I left the car parked down by the waterfront , in case you 're interested . " <p> They were silent , watching her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if at the end of that long telescopic tube , as if they were old birds , too dumb to fly , perched on chairs . Yes , birds , that fit them . Would they open their stupid beaks ? <p> She took a big breath . " I thought the car was okay at first , when I started it up , but then it smelled funny . Oily , kinda . " Still they persisted in their separate , glum silences . <p> " Okay , then , great , we 're all safe and sound ? Fine . I 'm going to bed . " She kicked off her sandals and pushed them with her toes to the side of the kitchen doorway . ( She repeated to herself her mother 's first rule : no shoes in the house . Her second : no bare feet . ) When she looked back around , her father was standing in the middle of the room , arms crossed , beak still closed . She noticed he was wearing his shiny black police oxfords , right there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes ! " she exclaimed , then giggled again . <p> He slammed a magazine onto the coffee table . It was being stoned that made her notice : Better Homes and Gardens . Who was reading that ? she wondered . <p> Then he spoke . " I just ca n't understand you , Francie Lou . Waltzing in here in the middle of the night , hours  --  hours  --  after  --  " <p> " And look at you ! " her mother cut in . " Dressed like a  --  I ca n't even say it ! " <p> Francie Lou laughed . " Yes you can , Mommy , c'm on , just once . Say ' ss-ll-uh-t . ' " <p> " Shut up , " said her father . " Shut up ! " <p> " We were worried enough as is ? ' Her mother was a crow now , beating her wings uselessly . " And then , where were you ? Where did you go ? Who knows ? Having another drink ? Having another accident ? How many calls can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drink after the accident . You did not get another call . Jesus , Mommy , have a little trust " ' <p> Her mother burst out with a loud squawk , a bird sound that started like nasty laughter but then petered out into a whimper . <p> " So where were you ? " her father prodded . A seagull , she thought , pecking around , scavenging in the dump . <p> She clenched her jaw , then opened it . " I ca n't believe this . I 'm shook up , y'know , I 've been in a car accident , remember ? And does anybody ask me am I all right ? Did anybody offer to come pick me up ? Jesus , Daddy , you left me to my own devices , and I did the best I fucking could . " <p> " Your language , young lady ! " shrilled her mother . <p> " We see you 're all right , " said her father . " The officers told me , believe me . " <p> She snickered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure they did . " <p> " You got yourself into the accident , " said the crow , tucking loose feathers under her scarf . " Your father gets you out of trouble again . Again . " <p> " Oh , he does , does he ? " <p> " And you did manage to get yourself home . You 're a big girl . " <p> She sighed loudly . " If I 'm such a big girl , then quit treating me like a child . " <p> " Whatever your age , dammit , " her father yelled , voice positively booming , " you live here in our house . You go by our rules . And you owe us , at minimum , some common courtesy ? <p> She threw him an angry look and raised her chin defiantly . " Yes sir ! Yes ma'am ! Is that common enough for you ? " <p> " Oh , Francie Lou , " said her mother in her low , resigned , there 's no-hope for-you voice . She picked up a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of the room . <p> Francie Lou saw the movements as a beating of wings . " Take off , that 's right ! " she shouted after her . " Let Daddy do the big interrogation . After all , that 's his job . " She threw herself down onto a dining room chair and glared at her father . <p> He stomped into the dining room . " Goddamn it , Francie Lou , I 'm pissed as hell ! " His grating voice was as angry and as domineering as it had been seconds before , but it had changed , as it always did when Margaret was out of hearing : not lowered , exactly , but loosened ever so slightly , a modulation only Francie Lou could detect , betraying a hint of relief . He yanked out a chair and sat down across from her . She watched him , his beak receding , as he became simply her angry father again . She could deal with that . <p> " You screw up ! " the harangue began . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to get out of the picture once it 's taken care of ! " <p> " Taken care of ! " she hooted . <p> " How many times can you come running to Daddy to fix it ? " She sighed . " Fix what ? " <p> " And keeping it outta the goddamn papers . Do you think that 's easy for me ? How many times , Francie Lou ? " <p> " What do you mean , fix it , Daddy ? " she asked . Had n't she fixed it herself ? <p> " Do n't , for God 's sake , ask me to spell it out for you , Francie Lou . " <p> Suddenly she felt dizzy . " I do n't think I get it , Daddy " <p> He blew out a long sigh of exasperation . " They treated you good , my men , right ? " <p> She groaned . " Are you serious ? Do you mean you think they did me some kind of favor out there ? " She was utterly lost now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got around the Breathalyzer . But what did he know ? Or think he knew ? That she 'd been tested and found sober , or not tested at all ? She tugged at the hem of her shirt , but it was no use : her bearings were gone . <p> " All they did was write out a ticket , right ? " he asked gruffly . <p> " Yes , Daddy , that 's all they did . " <p> " No arrest , no talk of charges , right ? And the other driver never got a chance to give you trouble ? " <p> " Just some attitude . " <p> " You do n't think that other one had reason to be out for blood ? " <p> She shrugged , dying for a cigarette . <p> He laughed . " So what does that mean , you 're just lucky ? " <p> She laughed , too . " I do n't know , Daddy , there 's still all the insurance stuff to get through , right ? " <p> He sneered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faking it . " <p> She suddenly felt a lump in her throat . For once she was really not faking . Instead she was floundering , in over her head and grasping for anything to hold on to . <p> " You 're bluffing , " he said , his tone utterly neutral . <p> Her voice shook . " And you 're not ? " <p> Their eyes met and locked . She was afraid he might actually answer her . But he said nothing , he did n't move at all , and the stare which they shared , maintained at first by an invisible but palpable tension from each of them , was usurped by his own hard glare , which pushed to hold and subdue her . She did n't breathe . The room was absolutely still , the heat more and more stifling . She struggled to glare back at him harder , unblinking , through an endless minute , while a videotape in her head spun silently out of control , racing back to the times when he 'd beat his own small children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy triumphing again and again over a five-year-old , a seven-year-old , an eight-year-old ; then to the giddyup horsy rides on his knee , those rapturous moments when she was encircled in his big strong arms and the entire sweep of his attention ; then fast-forwarded through a long blur to this eternity of uncertainty , this tug-of-war of glares . <p> But then , as if in response to something , his look shifted . Had hers , without her knowing ? Tiny smile lines began to crack first around his eyes , then at the corners of his mouth . Slowly he leaned forward , reached his arm all the way across the table and , with his thumb , blotted a tear from her cheek that she did n't know was there . <p> " Well , well , well , " he said . That was how he declared himself the winner . " Well , well . " Her tears  --  even just a single tear  --  automatically became his victory . Any show of feeling would have , but this hurt confusion of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game for him . She could read it now in his broadening smile : she could n't have pleased him more if she had tried . Shit . <p> He pushed his chair back from the table and stood up . " I 'm hungry . I 'm gon na make some toast . Want some , Francie Lou ? " Just like that , it was over . Balance was restored the way he liked it . <p> And she gathered herself together again . Grabbing at the hem of her shirt , she rose from her chair and followed him into the kitchen , where he seemed so large and clumsy , looming over those few , small , unimportant corners that were not his domain . He stared at the breadbox . <p> " I 'll do it , Daddy , " she said . She nudged him away , pulled out a bag , drew out six slices of white bread , and arranged them neatly on the toaster oven rack . <p> " So much ? " he questioned . <p> She shrugged . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had presented him one more gift , another of her distorted appetites . <p> But he was the one who went to the refrigerator first and searched for the real butter instead of the imitation crap her mother would have used . And he was the one who pulled out the pale slices before the toasting even stopped . Standing side by side at the counter , wielding their knives , Francie Lou and her father worked fast but carefully , each letting the melting yellow swirls soak down into the web of tiny dry craters before they heaped on jam . They both ate standing up , side by side , slurping at the sticky mounds of strawberry that dripped down the edges of the bread . With their fingers , they both dabbed up the jam that ran onto the countertop , then licked their fingers clean . And when Margaret suddenly cleared her throat in the kitchen doorway , Francie Lou and her father exchanged the same quick , knowing look and smiled the same quick , knowing smile . <p> " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housecoat around her as if she were cold . <p> Francie Lou turned toward her . " Go to sleep , Mommy , " she said . <p> " Go to sleep , Margaret " said the police chief over his shoulder as he shook the last four slices of bread out of the bag and opened the toaster door . <p> <p> By LUCY HONIG <p>
