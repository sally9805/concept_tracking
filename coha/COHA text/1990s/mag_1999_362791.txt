Gapped , American Eagled and Abercrombie &; Fitched to the teeth , teens emerge from cars packed four to a seat , flirting and yelling , heading for the back of senior Katie Sonderman 's tidy white house on Greeley Avenue . Within half an hour , the 24-ft. by 26-ft . Sonderman family room contains  --  just barely  --  about one-ninth of the Webster Groves High School student body . Suddenly an overhead projector flips on , two amplified acoustic guitars chime in and 160 youthful voices scream , " Here 's a story ! It 's sad but true ! About a girl that I once knew ! ... Keep away from Runaround Sue ! " <P> It is ebullient ; it is deafening . " It 's bigger than band , " says Herm Adams , who convened it . " It 's the largest group in the school . " Actually , not in the school . One of the peculiarities of life in Webster Groves is that in a community in which Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination , and in a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekday social event is Club , the entry level of a national Evangelical group called Young Life . <P> For 59 years , Young Life has specialized in gathering " unchurched " teens back into the religious fold ; officially nondenominational , Young Life has a strong Evangelical Protestant base . Wednesday-night Club is its accessible first level ; the second is Camp , a $500 , one-week stay at a Young Life facility . The third is Campaigners , a small group that convenes at the Adams ' home Fridays at 6 a.m. for prayer , fellowship and mutual exhortation : to bring new kids to Club . Of tonight 's hearty choristers , Adams estimates , 120 will end up trying Camp . Of those , he predicts , " probably 70% will give their life to Christ . " <P> The young crowd roars through Brown-Eyed Girl , The Lion Sleeps Tonight and other oldies that seem suspended in amber . " Yeah , they seem corny , " says a sophomore . " But everybody 's singing them , and that makes it fun , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laptop computer . " We want to do two things here , " he announces . " One , we want to have a lot of fun , and , two , we 're gon na answer some of the most serious and fundamental things about life . " He gestures to the computer . " You look at this , and you realize its a fairly complex piece of equipment . We recognize that someone fairly intelligent designed it . Our bodies and souls are far more complex than this is ... The Bible says God created heaven and earth and created us . What do you guys believe ? That is the starting point for us . " <P> Most students , teachers and Webster High parents support Young Life . " It 's incredibly cool , " enthuses Beth Perez , a Campaigners member . " It just shows kids , at a very early age , why they are here and what God has planned for them and how great their lives can be . " Her mother Susan Perez , a lapsed Catholic , speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children 's fervor , are extremely grateful for the program 's fruits . " If your teenager is going to be tied to some sort of group ; if she comes out of it saying I do n't drink , I do n't smoke pot , I do n't do this or that because I 'm a Christian ... well , that 's O.K. , " she says .
