<p> Kantian philosophers believed that art was good because it was useless . We believe that art is good because it is useful . " <p> So says Siah Armajani , who is one of the major sculptors working in the realm of public art today . This is a big summer for Mr. Armajani . On July 19 , his Olympic tower and bridge , built of wood and gray steel , topped by a brilliantly painted caldron , stood as the symbolic center of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and on millions of television screens around the world . <p> And any day now , Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to cut the ribbon for the new North Shore Esplanade Extension , a plaza on the Staten Island waterfront near the St. George Ferry Terminal , for which Mr. Armajani has built a 65-foot-long bridge and a 65-foot-tall tower topped with a lighthouse motif . <p> Mr. Armajani 's Staten Island project , whose design was a precursor to the one in Atlanta , cost about $500,000 and was financed through New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer size and expense , it constitutes one of the largest public art projects in New York in recent years , according to Tom Finkelpearl , the former director of the Percent for Art program . <p> The elusive Mr. Armajani may be the perfect man for the new age of public art , one in which cautious bureaucrats typically fear a repeat of controversies that resulted when artists challenged community tastes or tried to impose their egos on a community . Never again the outcry like the one accompanying the 1981 installation of Richard Serra 's " Tilted Arc " in Federal Plaza in Manhattan . Mr. Armajani , 56 , who was born in Iran , and became a citizen in 1968 , does n't like to leave his hometown , Minneapolis , refuses to be photographed and usually is n't even present when his projects are being built . <p> And his Staten Island project is a perfect example of the new public art . The steel and wood structure is painted a nonthreatening gray , with accents of green and orangey-yellow , to represent " the sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reddish-gold glass top , with a 1,000-watt light in it , to evoke the lighthouse facility that stood there from the 1860 's until the 1970 's . Also , like most of Mr. Armajani 's projects , it is functional . The bridge connects the bus ramp of the St. George Ferry Terminal to a section of the new plaza . <p> " I will not express my angst , " said Mr. Armajani of his esthetic . " The warmth and friendliness of the bridge  --  I work very hard at that . According to me , I should do something functional , something that should bring joy and happiness . We are just trying to harness our ego . " Mr. Armajani says his favorite public space is the immense Mall of America in his hometown . " Forty million people come to the mall , and they 're all happy , " he says . <p> THE SCULPTOR , A SLENDER man with round , black-framed glasses who usually wears a suit and tie , has had no formal training as an artist ; his undergraduate degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes airy remarks , as if in the end , words do n't matter . Indeed , he does n't always make sense . " By the way , I contradict myself quite a bit , " he says with a laugh . <p> It is all these qualities that have made Mr. Armajani a successful purveyor of the new public art , work that tries to be either participatory or functional . In 1988 , Mr. Armajani designed the Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge in Minneapolis , uniting two communities split by a 16-lane highway . Paul Goldberger , writing in The New York Times , called it " an almost magical mix of the toylike and the monumental . " <p> Mr. Armajani also designed the poetry garden for the headquarters of the Lannan Foundation in Los Angeles . And in 1983 , with the sculptor Scott Burton , the architect Cesar Pelli and the landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg , he collaborated on the design of the World Financial Center plaza in Lower Manhattan . Following the architectural traditions of Mr. Armajani 's native Iran , the railing along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Frank O'Hara and Walt Whitman . <p> Currently , Mr. Armajani is designing a bridge for Beloit , Wis. ; two skyway bridges for the Louisville , Ky. , airport ; a glass bridge for Newcastle , England , and three covered bridges for Leipzig , Germany . <p> The site of Mr. Armajani 's Staten Island project once had a utilitarian purpose . During the 1860 's , it was the location of the United States Lighthouse Service supply base for all lighthouses from Narragansett Bay to Delaware Bay . In 1939 the Coast Guard took over the property , and in the 1970 's it was given to the city . The deterioration began soon after . <p> For years , the fine old buildings , some historic landmarks , stood neglected . Homeless people took up residence in the officers ' houses . The land was overgrown with weeds and wild roses . Visitors crossing on the ferry were confronted by a forbidding sight , acres of vermin-infested land strewn with the husks of stolen cars and tantalizing glimpses of old red-brick buildings , one with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a symbol of the contradictions of Staten Island itself , a place of sweeping bluffs and glittering vistas , impregnated with the culture of the sea , yet in sections bleak and rife with urban decay . Many visitors coming for a day 's outing found little to do and simply turned around . <p> Over the years , Staten Islanders discussed various solutions to the problem , and one seemed to emerge in connection with a new ferry-maintenance building planned for the borough . In 1991 , a mayoral task force suggested extending the nearby Bay Street Landing Esplanade to the ferry terminal so people coming over on the ferry would have somewhere to go . The resulting plaza could accommodate art fairs and farmers ' markets , and , it was hoped , some of the old Coast Guard buildings adjacent to it could be restored and put to use . <p> The project was envisioned as the first stage of the planned six-mile-long esplanade running from the ferry terminal south to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and north to Snug Harbor . Eventually , the whole area might become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visitors . <p> In 1992 a landscape architectural firm , Johansson &; Walcavage , was hired to design the plaza . Under city law , a percent of the project 's total budget of approximately $40 million  --  about $33 million for a new maintenance building and about $7 million for the plaza  --  was designated for art . A panel of community leaders , local artists and representatives from city agencies was formed to consider what kind of art should be within the project area . <p> Late that year , the city 's Department of Cultural Affairs showed the panel slides of work by 81 artists , Mr. Armajani 's among them . The list was narrowed to 18 . It included Andrew Leicester , who designed the tile mosaics for Penn Station , an entrance to a Cincinnati park and a riverside walk in Philadelphia . Later , Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel , who had designed a series of glass blocks embedded with artifacts at Stuyvesant High School , were added . <p> In March 1993 , Mr. Armajani flew to New York to be interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site , " Mr. Armajani said afterward . " Some did . But I 'm not that fast . " Some of the panelists felt that the scale of his work might overwhelm the site . Others thought that his passion for bridges was ideal for the project . <p> Mr. Armajani won the final round of voting , with 13 votes , and Mr. Leicester close behind at 12 , and Ms. Jones and Mr. Ginzel with 11 . " It was the closest vote I 'd ever seen for a project like this , " said Mr. Finkelpearl . <p> Then the real planning began , with Mr. Armajani flying regularly to New York for community meetings . " I told them I 'm not interested in their taste , " he said . " But I listen very carefully to the needs of the people . " <p> In his stark studio in a warehouse district in Minneapolis , filled with models of his projects , Mr. Armajani began constructing a model of the tower and bridge from balsa and cardboard . There were already discussions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new plaza . Did Mr. Armajani originally have a bridge in mind for the site , a bridge that would be a work of art ? Well , he always does bridges . Also , he added with a laugh , " I always gravitate toward the lazy . Besides , I 'm always looking for a bridge . " <p> Mr. Armajani , who often incorporates snatches of poetry in his work , this time chose some lines from Wallace Stevens . " It is very important to invite people to come to the piece , " Mr. Armajani said . At the same time , he said , he wanted " to be a little bit subversive , to attract attention to someone good . " <p> CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLAZA began last spring . A structural engineer photographed the area with a video camera , and , using a computer , calculated the possible effect of wind changes and stress points on Mr. Armajani 's design . At American Structural Metals in Hugo , Minn. , 30 workers began to make the bridge and tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outfitted with granite tables topped with chessboards , decorative red buoys and garden furniture . <p> On Friday and Saturday , May 24 and 25 , in Minnesota , the bridge and tower were loaded in pieces onto seven tractor trailers , each 45 feet long . On Tuesday , May 28 , the convoy , sometimes accompanied by escort vans with flashing lights , set out for Staten Island . Two days later , three trucks carrying the tower arrived at the New Jersey side of the Goethals Bridge . At 4 A.M. on Friday , May 31 , they arrived at Bay Street in Staten Island while four others loaded with sections of the new bridge arrived later . <p> Mr. Armajani was nowhere to be found . " The piece was too large for me to install , " he explained . But he was keeping in touch by phone . <p> Finally , on midday on Wednesday , June 5 , the bridge was lowered onto steel piers . At 4:40 P.M. , the last bolts were being tightened . Passengers leaving Staten Island on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining through the orange-colored glass of the lighthouse tower . <p> High on the horizontal framework of the bridge were some of Wallace Stevens 's words , in small brass letters : " The cloud rose upward like a heavy stone/ That lost its heaviness through the same will , / Which changed light green to olive then to blue .
