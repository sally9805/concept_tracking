Her heroes were Abraham Lincoln and Albert Einstein . Lincoln was out of the question , but with a little work I could look Einsteinesque . I grew a dark mustache , adopted wild graying hair . From wardrobe I requisitioned a pair of wool slacks , a white cotton shirt , a gabardine jacket with narrow lapels . The shoes were my own , my prized possession  --  genuine leather , Australian copies of mid twentieth-century brogues , comfortable , well broken in . The prep-room mirror reflected back a handsomer , taller , younger relative of old Albert , a cross between Einstein and her psychiatrist Dr. Greenson . <p> The moment-universes surrounding the evening of Saturday , August 4 were so thoroughly burned  --  tourists , biographers , conspiracy hunters , masturbators  --  that there was no sense arriving then . Besides , I wanted to get a taste of the old LA , before the quake . So I selected the Friday evening 18:00 PDT moment-universe . I materialized in a stall in the men 's room at the Santa Monica Municipal Airport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train stations , bus terminals . Lots of strangers if you 've missed some detail of costume . Public transport easily available . Crowds to lose oneself in . The portable unit , disguised as an overnight bag , never looks out of place . I stopped in a shop and bought a couple of packs of Luckies . At the Hertz counter I rented a navy blue Plymouth with push-button transmission , threw my canvas camera bag and overnight case into the back and , checking the map , puzzled out the motel address on Wilshire Boulevard that Research had found for me . <p> The hotel was ersatz Spanish , pink stucco and a red tile roof , a colonnade around a courtyard pool where a teenage boy in white T-shirt and DA haircut leaned on a cleaning net and flirted with a couple of fifteen-year-old girls . I sat in the shadowed doorway of my room , smoked a Lucky and watched until a fat woman in caftan came out and yelled at the boy to get back to work . The girls giggled . The early evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-tsunami pier , the one she would tell Greenson she was going to visit Saturday night before she changed her mind and stayed home . I ate at the Dancers : a slab of prime rib , a baked potato the size of a football , a bottle of zinfandel . Afterward I drove my Plymouth along the Miracle Mile . I rolled down the windows and let the warm air wash over me , inspecting the strip joints , theaters , bars , and hookers . A number of the women , looking like her in cotton-candy hair and tight dresss , gave me the eye as I cruised by . <p> I pulled into the lot beside a club called the Blue Note . Over the door a blue neon martini glass swamped a green neon dive in gold neon gin . Inside I ordered a scotch and listened to a trio play jazz . A thin white guy with a goatee strangled his saxophone : somewhere in there might be a melody . These cutting-edge late-moderns thought they had the future augured . The future would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did n't understand that the future , like the present , would be dominated by saps , and the big rush of 2043 would be barbershop quartets . <p> I sipped scotch . A brutal high , alcohol , like putting your head in a vise . I liked it . I smoked a couple more Luckies , layering a nicotine buzz over the alcohol . I watched couples in the dim corners of booths talk about their pasts and their futures , all those words prelude to going to bed . Back in Brentwood she was spending another sleepless night harassed by calls telling her to leave Bobby Kennedy alone . <p> A woman with dark Jackie hair , black gloves , and a very low-cut dress sat down on the stool next to me . The song expired and there was a smattering of applause . " I hate this modern crap , do n't you ? " the woman said . <p> " It 's emblematic of the times , " I said . <p> She gave me a look , decided to laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen worse , " I said . . . <p> " You 're not American , are you ? The accent . " <p> " I was born in Germany . " <p> " Ah . So you 've seen bad times ? " <p> I sipped my scotch . " You could say so . " Her eyelids were heavy with shadow , eyelashes a centimeter long . Pale pink lipstick made her thin lips look cool ; I wondered if they really were . " Let me buy you a drink . " <p> " Thanks . " She watched me fumble with the queer , nineteenth-century style currency . Pyramids with eyes on them , redeemable in silver on demand . I bought her a gin and tonic . " My name 's Carol , " she told me . <p> I am Detlev . " <p> " Detleff ? Funny name . " <p> " Not so common , even in Germany . " <p> " So Detleff. what brings you to LA ? You come over the Berlin Wall ? " <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted . " Wo n't find any in here . " <p> " I think you could be a movie star , Carol . " <p> " You 're not going to believe this , Detleff , but I 've heard that line before . " <p> " You 'll have to offer me another then . " <p> We flirted through three drinks . She told me she was lonely , I told her I was a stranger . We fell toward a typical liaison of the Penicillin Era : we learned enough about each other ( who knew how much of it true ? ) not to let what we did n't know come between us and what we wanted . Her image of me was compounded by her own fantasies . I did n't have so many illusions . Or maybe mine were larger still , since I knew next-to-nothing about these people other than what I 'd gleaned from images projected on various screens . An image had brought me here ; images were my job . They had something to do with reality , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed by Carol 's dress , she leaned against my shoulder , and from this we generated a lust we imagined would turn to sweet compassion , make up for our losses , and leave us blissfully complete in the same place . We would clutch each other 's bodies until we were spent , lie holding each other close , our souls commingled , the first moment of a perfect marriage that would extend forward from this night in an endless string of equally fulfilling nights . Then we 'd part in the morning and never see each other again . That was the dream . I followed her back to her apartment and we did our best to produce it . Afterward I lay awake thinking of Gabrielle , just after we 'd married , sunbathing on the screened beach at Nice . I 'd watched her , as had the men who passed by . How much of her wanted us to look at her ? Was there any difference , in her mind , between my regard and theirs ? <p> I left Carol asleep with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the pink hotel , and got some sleep of my own . <p> Saturday I spent touring pre-quake LA . I indulged vices I could not indulge in Munich in 2043 . I smoked many cigarettes . I walked outside in direct sunlight . I bought a copy of the Wilhelm edition of the I Ching , printed on real paper . At midafternoon I stepped into a diner and ordered a bacon cheeseburger , rare , with lettuce and tomato and a side of fries . My mouth watered as the waitress set it in front of me , but after two bites I felt overcome by a wave of nausea . Hands sticky with blood and mayonnaise , I watched the grease congeal in the corner of the plate . <p> So far , so good . I was a fan of the dirty pleasures of the twentieth century . Things were so much more complicated then . People walked the streets under the shadow of the bomb . They all knew , at some almost biological level , that they might be vaporized at any second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . I imagined my ancestors half a world away in a country they expected momentarily to turn into a radioactive battleground , carrying their burden of guilt through the Englischer Garten . Sober Adenauer , Marilyn , the world over , was their goddess . That improbable female body , that infantile voice , that oblivious demeanor . <p> Architecturally , LA 1962 was a disappointment . There was the appropriate amount of kitsch , hot-dog stands shaped like hot dogs and chiropractors ' offices like flying saucers , but the really big skyscrapers that would come down in the quake had n't been built yet . Maybe some of them would n't be built in this time-line anymore , thanks to me . By now my presence , through the butterfly effect , had already set this history off down another path from the one of my home . Anything I did toppled dominoes . Perhaps Carol 's life would be ruined by the memory of our night of perfect love . Perhaps the cigarettes I bought saved crucial lives . Perhaps the breeze of my Plymouth 's passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better or worse , who could say ? <p> I killed time into the early evening . By now she was going through the two-hour session with Greenson trying to shore up her personality against that night 's depression . <p> At 9:00 I took my camera bag and the portable unit and got into the rental car . It was still too early , but I was so keyed up I could n't sit still . I drove up the Pacific Coast Highway , walked along the beach at Malibu , then turned around and headed back . Sunset Boulevard twisted through the hills . The lights of the houses flickered between trees . In Brentwood I had some trouble finding Carmelina , drove past , then doubled back . Marilyn 's house was on Fifth Helena , a short street off Carmelina ending in a cul-de-sac . I parked at the end , slung my bags over my shoulder , and walked back . <p> A brick and stucco wall shielded the house from the street . I circled round through the neighbor 's yard , pushed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest hacienda-style ranch , a couple of bedrooms , tile roof . The patio lights were off and the water in the pool lay Smooth as dark glass . Lights shone from the end bedroom to the far left . First problem would be to get rid of Eunice Murray , her companion and housekeeper . If what had happened in our history was true in this one , she 'd gone to sleep at midevening . I stepped quietly through the back door , found her in her bedroom and slapped a sedative patch onto her forearm , holding my hand across her mouth against her struggling until she was out . <p> A long phone cord snaked down the hall from the living room and under the other bedroom door . The door was locked . Outside , I pushed through the shrubs , mucking up my shoes in the soft soil , reached in through the bars over the opened window , and pushed aside the blackout curtains . Marilyn sprawled face down across the bed , right arm dangling off the side , receiver clutched in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent side of the house , broke it open , then climbed inside . Her breathing was deep and irregular . Her skin was clammy . Only the faintest pulse at her neck . <p> I rolled her onto her back , got my bag , pried back her eyelid and shone a light into her eye . Her pupil barely contracted . I had come late on purpose , but this was not good . <p> I gave her a shot of apomorphine , lifted her off the bed and shouldered her toward the bathroom . She was surprisingly light  --  gaunt , even . I could feel her ribs . In the bathroom , full of plaster and junk from the remodelers , I held her over the toilet until she vomited . No food , but some undigested capsules . That would have been a good sign , except she habitually pierced them with a pin so they 'd work faster . There was no way of telling how much Nembutal she had in her bloodstream . <p> I dug my thumb into the crook of her elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wake up , Norma Jeane , " I said . " Time to wake up . " No reaction . <p> I took her back to the bed and got the blood filter out of my camera bag . The studio 'd had me practicing on indigents hired from the state . I wiped a pharmacy 's worth of pill bottles from the flimsy table next to the bed and set up the machine . The shunt slipped easily into the artery in her arm , and I fiddled with the flow until the readout went green . What with one thing and another I had a busy half hour before she was resting in bed , bundled up , feet elevated , asleep but breathing normally , God in his heaven , and her blood circulating merrily through the filter like money through my bank account . <p> I went outside and smoked a cigarette . The stars were out and a breeze had kicked up . On the tile threshold outside the front door words were emblazoned : " Cursum Perficio . " I am finishing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I went back and sat in the bedroom . The place was a mess . Forests of pill bottles covered every horizontal surface . A stack of Sinatra records sat on the record player . On top : " High Hopes . " Loose-leaf binders lay scattered all over the floor . I picked one up . It was a script for Something 's Got to Give . <p> I read through the script . It was n't very good . About 2:00 a.m. she moaned and started to move . I slapped a clarifier patch onto her arm . It would n't push the pentobarbital out of her system any faster , but when it began to take hold it would make her feel better . <p> About 3:00 the blood filter beeped . I removed the shunt , sat her up , made her drink a liter of electrolyte . It took her a while to get it all down . She looked at me through fogged eyes . She smelled sour and did not look like the most beautiful woman in the world . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many pills . ' You 're going to be all right . " <p> I helped her into a robe , then walked her down the hallway and around the living room until she began to take some of the weight herself . At one end of the room hung a couple of lurid Mexican Day of the Dead masks , at the other a framed portrait of Lincoln . When I got tired of facing down the leering ghouls and honest Abe , I took her outside and we marched around the pool in the darkness . The breeze wrote cat 's paws on the surface of the water . After a while she began to come around . She tried to pull away but was weak as a baby . " Let me go , " she mumbled . <p> " You want to stop walking ? " <p> " I want to sleep , " she said . <p> " Keep walking . " We circled the pool for another quarter hour . In the distance I heard sparse traffic on Sunset ; nearer the breeze rustled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . <p> " Please , " she whined . " Let 's stop . " <p> I let her down onto a patio chair , went inside , found some coffee and set a pot brewing . I brought a blanket out , wrapped her in it , poked her to keep her awake until the coffee was ready . Eventually she sat there sipping coffee , holding the cup in both hands to warm them , hair down in her eyes and eyelashes gummed together . She looked tired . " How are you ? " I asked . <p> " Alive . Bad luck . " She started to cry . " Cruel , all of them , all those bastards . " Oh , Jesus ... " <p> I let her go on for a while . I gave her a handkerchief and she dried her eyes , blew her nose . The most beautiful woman in the world . " Who are you ? " she asked . <p> " My name is Detlev Gruber . Call me Det . " <p> " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't remember ? You sent her home . " <p> She took a sip of coffee , watching me over the rim of the cup . <p> " I 'm here to help you , Marilyn . To rescue you . " <p> " Rescue me ? " <p> " I know how hard things are , how lonely you 've been . I knew that you would try to kill yourself . " <p> " I was just trying to get some sleep . " <p> " Do you really think that 's all there is to it ? " <p> " Listen , mister , I do n't know who you are but I do n't need your help and if you do n't get out of here pretty soon I 'm going to call the police . " Her voice trailed off pitifully at the end . " I 'm sorry , " she said . <p> " Do n't be sorry . I 'm here to save you from all this . " <p> Hands shaking , she put down the cup . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide it , but her expression was full of need . I felt an urge to protect her that , despite the fact she was a wreck , was pure sex . " I 'm cold , " she said . " Can we go inside ? " <p> We went inside . We sat in the living room , she on the sofa and I in an uncomfortable Spanish chair , and I told her things about her life that nobody should have known but her . The abortions . The suicide attempts . The Kennedy affairs . The way Sinatra treated her . More than that , the fear of loneliness , the fear of insanity , the fear of aging . I found myself warming to the role of rescuer . I really did want to hold her , for more than one reason . She was not able to keep up her hostility in the face of the knowledge that I was telling her the simple truth . Miller had written how grateful she was every time he 'd saved her life , and it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd always liked being rescued , and the men who rescued her . <p> The clarifier might have had something to do with it , too . Finally she protested , " How do you know all this ? " <p> " This is going to be the hardest part , Marilyn . I know because I 'm from the future . If I had not shown up here , you would have died tonight . It 's recorded history . " <p> She laughed . " From the future ? " <p> " Absolutely . " <p> " Right . " <p> " I 'm not lying to you , Marilyn . If I did n't care , would you be alive now ? " <p> She pulled the blanket tighter around her . " What does the future want with me ? " <p> " You 're the most famous actress of your era . Your death would be a great tragedy , and we want to prevent that . " <p> " What good does this do me ? I 'm still stuck in the same shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She tried to look skeptical but hope was written in every tremble of her body . It was frightening . " I want you to come with me back to the future , Marilyn . " <p> She stared at me . " You must be crazy . I would n't know anybody . No friends , no family . " <p> " You do n't have any family . Your mother is in an institution . And where were your friends tonight ? " <p> She put her hand to her head , rubbed her forehead , a gesture so full of troubled intelligence that I had a sudden sense of her as a real person , a grown woman in a lot of trouble . " You do n't want to mess with me , " she said . " I 'm not worth it . I 'm nothing but trouble . " <p> " I can cure your trouble . In the future we have ways . No one here really cares for you , Marilyn , no one truly understands you . That dark pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill it . We can heal the wounds you 've had since you were a little girl , make up for all the neglect you 've suffered , keep you young forever . We have these powers . it 's my job to correct the mistakes of the past , for special people . You 're one of them . I have a team of caregivers waiting for you , a home , emotional support , understanding . " <p> " Yeah . Another institution . I ca n't take it . " I came over , sat beside her , lowered my voice , looked her in the eyes . Time for the closer . " You know that poem  --  that Yeats poem ? " <p> " What poem ? " <p> " Never Give All the Heart . " Research had made me memorize it . It was one of her favorites . <p> " Never give all the heart , for love , <p> Will hardly seem worth thinking of <p> To passionate women if it seem <p> Certain , and they never dream <p> That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lovely is <p> But a brief , dreamy , kind delight ... " <p> She stopped me . " What about it ? " Her voice was edgy . <p> " Just that life does n't have to be like the poem , brief , and you do n't have to suffer . You do n't have to give all the heart , and lose . " <p> She sat there , wound in the blanket . Clearly I had touched something in her . <p> " Think about it , " I said . I went outside and smoked another Lucky . When I 'd started working for DAA I 'd considered this a glamour job . Exotic times , famous people . And I was good at it . quick study , smart , adaptable . Sincere . I was so good that Gabrielle came to hate me , and left . <p> After a considerable while Marilyn came outside , the blanket over her head and shoulders like an Indian . <p> " Well , kemosabe ? " I asked . <p> Despite herself , she smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet at the corners of her eyes were visible . " If I do n't like it , will you bring me back ? " <p> " You 'll like it . But if you do n't I promise I 'll bring you back . " <p> " Okay . What do I have to do ? " <p> " Just pack a few things to take with you  --  the most important ones . " <p> I waited while she threw some clothes into a suitcase . She took the Lincoln portrait off the wall and put it in on top . I bagged the blood filter and set up the portable unit in the living room . <p> " Maf ! " she said . <p> " What ? " <p> " My dog ! " She looked crushed , as if she were about to collapse . " Who 'll take care of Maf ? " <p> " Mrs. Murray will . " <p> " She hates him ! I ca n't trust her . " <p> She was disintegrating . " I ca n't go . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is Maf ? We 'll take him . " <p> We went out to the guest house . The place stunk . The dog , sleeping on an old fur coat , launched himself at me , yapping , as soon as we opened the door . It was one of those inbred overgroomed toy poodles that you want to drop kick into the next universe . She picked him up , cooed over him , made me get a bag of dog food and his water dish . I gritted my teeth . <p> In the living room I moved the chair aside and made her stand in the center of the room while I laid the wire circle around us to outline the field . She was nervous . I held her hand , she held the dog . " Here we go , Marilyn . " <p> I touched the switch on the case . Marilyn 's living room receded from us in all directions , we fell like pebbles into a dark well , and from infinitely far away the transit stage at DAA rushed forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put a hand to her head . I held her arm to steady her . From the control booth Scoville and a nurse came up to us . The nurse took Marilyn other side . " Marilyn , this is a nurse who 's going to help you get some rest . And this is Derek Scoville , who 's running this operation . " <p> We got her into the suite and the doctors shot her full of metabolic cleansers . I promised her I 'd take care of Maf , then pawned the dog off on the staff . I held her hand , smiled reassursingly , sat with her until she went to sleep . Lying there she looked calm , confident . She liked being cared for ; to she was used to it . Now she had a whole new world waiting to take care of her . She thought . <p> It was all up to me . <p> I went to the prep room , showered , and switched to street clothes : an onyx Singapore silk shirt , cotton baggies , spex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day : I selected a broad-brimmed hat . I was inspecting my shoes , which looked ruined from the muck from Marilyn 's garden , when a summons from Scoville showed in the corner of my spex : meet them in the conference room . Levine and Sally House were there , and the doctor , and Jason Cryer from publicity . " So , what do you think ? " Levine asked me . <p> " She 's in pretty rough shape . Physically she can probably take it , but emotionally she 's a wreck . " <p> " Tomorrow we 'll inject her with nanorepair devices , " the doctor said . " She 's probably had some degree of renal damage , if not worse . " <p> " Christ , have you seen her scars ? " Levine said . " How many operations has she had ? Did they just take a cleaver to them back then ? " <p> " They took a cleaver first , then an airbrush , " Sally said . <p> " We 'll fix the scars , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood was between Cryer and a news camera . " And Detlev here will be her protector , right Det ? After all , you saved her life . You 're her friend . Her dad . Her lover , if it comes to that . " <p> " Right , " I said . I thought about Marilyn , asleep at last . What expectations did she have ? <p> Scoville spoke for the first time . " I want us into production within three weeks . We 've got eighty million already invested in this . Sally , you can crank publicity up to full gain . We 're going to succeed where all the others have failed . We 're going to put : the first viable Marilyn on the wire . She may be a wreck , but she wants to be here . Not like Paramount 's version . " <p> " That 's where we 're smart , " Cryer said . " We take into account the psychological factors . " <p> I could n't stand much more . After the meeting I rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I approached the front doors I could see a crowd of people had gathered outside in the bright sunlight . Faces slick with factor 400 sunscreen , they shouted and carried picket signs . " End Time Exploitation . " " Information , not People . " " Hands off the Past . " <p> Not one gram of evidence existed that a change in a past moment-universe had ever affected our own time . They were as separate as two sides of a coin . Of course it was true that once you burned a particular universe you could never go back . But with an eternity of moment-universes to exploit , who cared ? <p> The chronological protection fanatics would be better off taking care of the historicals who were coming to litter up the present , the ones who could n't adjust , or outlasted their momentary celebrity , or turned out not to be as interesting to the present as their sponsors had imagined . A lot of money had been squandered on bad risks . Who really wanted to listen to new compositions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-first century , let alone write VR scripts that anybody would want to experience ? <p> I sneaked out the side door and caught the metro down at the corner . Rode the train through Hollywood and up to my arcology . <p> In the newsstand I uploaded the latest trades into my spex , then stopped into the men 's room to get my shoes polished . While the valet worked I smoked the last of my Luckies and checked the news . Jesus , still hotter than a pistol , was the lead on Variety . He smiled , new teeth , clean shaven , homely little Jew , but even through the holo he projected a lethal charisma . That one was making Universal rich . Who would have thought that a religious mystic with an Aramaic accent would become such a talk-show shark , his virtual image the number one teleromantics dream date ? " Jesus ' Laying on of Hands is the most spiritual experience I 've ever had over fiberoptic VR , " gushed worldwide recording megastar Daphne Overdone . <p> On Hollywood Grapevine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAA , was unhappy with third-quarter earnings . If Scoville went down , the new boss would pull the plug on all his projects . My contractual responsibilities would then , as they say , be at an end . <p> " What a mess you made of these shoes , Herr Gruber , " the valet muttered in German . I switched off my spex and watched him finish . The arco hired a lot of indigents . It was cheap , and good PR , but the valet was my personal reclamation project . His unruly head of hair danced as he buffed my shoes to a high luster . He looked up at me . " How is that ? " <p> " Looks fine . " I fished out a twenty-dollar piece . He watched me with his watery , sad , intelligent eyes . His brown hair was going gray . <p> " I see you got a mustache , like mine , " he said . <p> " Only for work . For a while I need to look like you , Albert . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room . <p>
