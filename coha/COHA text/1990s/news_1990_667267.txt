<p> ' T was time for the tourneys And all through the land , All the players were dribbling , Their jumpers were canned . Their sweat socks were hung By the backboard with care , In hopes that Saint Nicholas Soon would be there . Hold it , hold it . No. 13 St. John 's we know . But who is this St. Nicholas ? Is St. Nick ranked , too ? <p> Well , yes . This time of year , he 's No. 1 . <p> And , this time of year , so is college basketball . <p> Because just as surely as Christmas and Hanukkah mean good cheer , they also mean good cheers - dozens of holiday tournaments featuring hundreds of players with more than visions of sugarplums dancing in their heads . <p> " We have a chance to give ourselves an early Christmas present , " says Florida International player Dwight Stewart . <p> It really ' t is time for tournaments . Florida International 's Golden Panther Holiday Classic in Miami and Hawaii 's Pre-Holiday Tournament in Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 36 men 's and 33 women 's Division I tournaments to be played between tonight and the Feast of the Epiphany Jan. 6 , the 12th day of Christmas . <p> Oh , and that does n't even count the 34 other men 's and 55 women 's tournaments already played in December . <p> That 's a total of 158 tournaments and more than 600 games . Which is a lot of basketball . But as the song almost says : All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Seats . <p> And if you like Christmas songs like that one , try next week 's Music City Invitational in Nashville . Vanderbilt hosts Austin Peay , Rice and Fordham - coached not by St. Nick , but by Nick Macarchuk . <p> " Christmas is a bad time for home games , because the students are gone , " says Macarchuk . " But you do n't want your kids hanging out for two weeks . So Christmas tournaments give you a chance to get in some games and take the kids someplace nice in the bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , home of three holiday tournaments , including next week 's eight-team Rainbow Classic . Some of the best tourneys are the ones aligned with football bowl games , like the Fiesta Bowl Classic ( featuring No. 4 Arizona ) and the USF &G; Sugar Bowl Tournament ( starring Georgia Tech 's sugar-sweet Kenny Anderson ) . <p> Tonight begins the third Golden Panther Holiday Classic . Clemson plays Coppin State and host Florida International meets Florida Atlantic . <p> How about this for a future field : Florida International , California , Minnesota and Canisius ? That would be the Golden Panthers , Golden Bears , Golden Gophers and Golden Griffins - in an imaginary Golden Panther Classic sponsored by Molson Golden . ( Do n't laugh - Friday 's Old Style Classic in Chicago is sponsored by a beer company . ) <p> " Hey , great idea , " says Florida International 's Stewart , a 6-7 forward . " Last year , we played Georgia State in the tournament - the Crimson Panthers vs. the Golden Panthers . We beat ' em , too . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , for that matter . The first year , the Panthers even lost to tournament winner Ball State in the first round . They have since learned Rule No. 1 of invitational tournaments - always rig the matchups to give the host team its best chance to reach the final , ensuring home fans show up the second night . <p> Struggling schools like Florida International ( 2-5 ) must entice good programs like Clemson and Coppin State ( both NCAA tournament teams last season ) to goose attendance at their tournaments . <p> The irony is top teams like No. 7 Indiana often do the opposite - with predictable results . Indiana hosts two holiday tournaments each season , the Indiana Classic and the Hoosier Classic . Guess who has never lost a game in either one . <p> The Hoosiers won the Indiana Classic two weeks ago by decimating designated victims Niagara and San Diego . Next up is next week 's Hoosier Classic with Marshall , Ohio University and North Texas . <p> " Some tournaments are more competitive than others , " says NCAA assistant statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach once said of holiday tournaments , ' Gim me three teams I can beat and we 'll call it a Classic . ' " <p> North Texas is a popular tournament opponent . It will play in tonight 's Hawaii Pre-Holiday Tournament before next week 's Hoosier Classic . That 's what a 5-25 record like last season 's will do for you . <p> Women 's tournaments , to their credit , are not as likely to feature a ranked team with rank teams . In fact , no fewer than three holiday tourneys feature three ranked teams : Friday 's Cardinal Classic with host No. 13 Stanford , No. 3 Georgia , No. 9 Northwestern and unranked Brigham Young ; next week 's Super Shootout in Hilton Head , S.C. , with Stanford , No. 8 Tennessee , No. 20 Texas and unranked Ohio State ; and next week 's Bell Atlantic Holiday Tournament with host No. 18 Rutgers , Georgia , No. 10 Arkansas and recently ranked Maryland . <p> Why do top women 's teams play more blockbuster tournaments than top men 's teams ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defending national champion Stanford . " But there is a good reason . The women 's NCAA tournament is played back-to-back . The men get a day off between games . So tournaments give you a chance to see how your team can do against good competition on consecutive days . " <p> The games at the Super Shootout will be top shelf ; the same ca n't be said of where they will be played . The Hilton Head Island Recreation Center seats about 500 and its court is 10 feet shorter than regulation . <p> " It 's an exciting trip for the kids , " says VanDerveer , " but our guarantee does n't even pay all of our expenses for it . " <p> Men 's tournaments are in larger arenas - for instance , next week 's 39th ECAC Holiday Festival in New York 's Madison Square Garden , which has Rutgers , Maryland , BYU and South Carolina . <p> " You used to be able to count on fans coming out because it was part of a holiday tradition , " says Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're finding that is not as true as it once was . " <p> A dozen years ago , the Holiday Festival averaged 17,000 for two nights ; last season attendance slipped to half that . <p> " It used to be easier to schedule good teams , " says Chapman . " Now , with the expansion of conferences and fewer games on schedules , it is becoming more difficult . " <p> Some tournaments feature all in-state teams ( like next week 's Times- Dispatch Invitational in Richmond , Va. , with Richmond , James Madison , Virginia Tech and Virginia Commonwealth ) . <p> Some have unwieldy sponsor names - like Dr Pepper Classic in Chattanooga , Tenn. ; Medical Value Plan Classic in Toledo , Ohio ; and Eastern Airlines Palm Beach Classic in West Palm Beach , Fla . <p> Miami meets Miami in that last tournament - Miami of Florida vs . Miami of Ohio . <p> In December 1985 , St. Joseph 's ( Maine ) invited St. Joseph 's ( Vt . ) , St. Joseph 's ( Brooklyn , N.Y. ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament . St. Joseph 's won . The host team , that is . <p> There is no more all-St . Joseph 's Tournament , but there is the St. Louis Christmas Tournament , which starts Friday and matches host St. Louis against Morgan State , Northwestern and Western Illinois . <p> That 's the St. Louis Billikens - not the St. Nicholas Blitzens . Which brings us back to that right jolly old elf . <p> He 's put on a few pounds . He 's lost a step . And he ca n't go to his left anymore . But St. Nick would still be a big favorite in a field with St. Bonaventure , St. Olaf and St. Norbert . St. Nick laced up his sneaks , In his heart had no fear , Then took off down the lane Like a rapid reindeer . And as he slam-dunked the ball We could hear him exclaim : ' Happy Christmas to all - And to all a good game ! '
