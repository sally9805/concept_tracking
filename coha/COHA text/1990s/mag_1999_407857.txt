Back in December , we decided to challenge our readers to a totally different kind of fitness makeover : an inner-outdoor adventure that would tap their every cell . After scouring 3,000-plus reader entries , we chose Angela Babb , a 27-year-old actress from Portland , Ore. , and Roxanne Lee , a 30-year-old information systems consultant from Los Angeles , Both demonstrated the high level of fitness and commitment to go - and grow - way beyond their comfort levels , as demanded by this experience . For our pilots , we chose Sheri Griffith , owner of Sheri Griffith , owner of Sheri Griffith Expeditions in Moab , Utah , a foremost river guide and leader in women 's growth experiences and her sidekick Faerthen Felix , a riverside **52;314;TOOLONG chef who provided an endless supply of four-star food for body and soul ; Also gently leading our readers : Susan Cantwell , a personal trainer from New Brunswick , Canada ; social worker Kristine Huffman , M.S.W. , executive director of Headnote health and healing at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires , Lenox , Mass. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacobs , Shape senior editor , travel . Photograph // So where 's the Jacuzzi ? quips Roxanne , cinching her jacket tight against the cold-wet-gray of the river . and sky . Angela peers out from her hood across the mud-colored water ; the rest of us shift uneasily in our polypro and fleece . We 've only been on the river for an hour and already we 're freezing . " Second prize is a two-week rafting trip , " I joke . In the ensuing silence we read each other 's minds : Five days will be enough . We had promised our two winning readers a fitness makeover courtesy of the wilds , and from the look of things ( the weather , usually sunny and warm this time of year , had turned unseasonably sinister just in time for our adventure ) , we were all going to get one . We 're on a **28;368;TOOLONG adventure through Desolation Canyon , a roadless desert without a flush toilet or pay phone for miles ; even cell phones ca n't penetrate the labyrinthine maze . Beneath us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen with sediment pulling against an ocean of and . From either shore the land lifts in treeless cliffs and boulders poised at precarious angles - an earth with no skin under a blank stare of sky . A camel 's hump of dry bags is lashed to the back of the raft : our provisions for the week . These oversized Ziploc bags hold our food and clothing ; tents and sleeping bags ; medical supplies and matches ; leather , feathers " and beads for making medicine bags ; marshmallows for making s'mores . Just an hour before , we 'd all peered excitedly from the windows of a single  --  prop plane , soaring mere inches ( or so it seemed ) over a Zorroland of slash canyons and razorback ridges . Landing in a flat valley between the spines of the brontosaurus 's back , we 'd leapt from the plane like sprung gazelles , embraced the wide-open sky , then single-filed a mile down a zigzag path to the Green River , a stone-encased artery that 's more brown than green . Photograph Side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we float along , we ask our two readers what they are bringing to the adventure - and what they expect to get out of it . Roxanne says she is n't worried about the kayaking , canyon hiking or camping  --  she 's done plenty of that . A recreational athlete ( running , rock climbing , Pilates ) whose workout revolves around volleyball and yoga , she feels up for any physical challenge Desolation can offer . When she confesses that her only reservation about the trip is having to spend five days of enforced togetherness with seven women , we 're surprised . She seems so outgoing . " I do n't have any sisters , " she explains , suddenly turning shy . " And a lot of my friends are men . " When we ask about her goals , she rattles off a resume 's worth , including " reducing unnecessary items in my environment ( including thoughts and feelings ) , " and " providing support to valuable people in my life . " Angela , an avid cyclist and occasional hiker , uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . Never having been camping or kayaking , she is psyched about opening herself up to new experiences and getting out of her comfort zone , " although I 'm a little nervous about keeping up on the hikes , " she admits . As the canyon narrows , Sheri tells us to kiss our expectations goodbye . Then she demands our wristwatches . " We 're on river time now , " she says . " Keep it inside the canyon . " As if on cue , the sky unleashes a chilly drizzle . I can almost hear the enthusiasm fizzle from the raft like a slow leak . With a final heave of the oars , Sheri rows into Stampede Flats , a narrow sliver of beach fringed by leafy cottonwoods . We step off gingerly so we wo n't get our feet wet . Goodbye to Flat Water We crawl out of our sleeping bags to a steely dawn . Angela 's a zombie : " I did not sleep a wink . " Roxanne feels fluish . We all eat breakfast with our wool gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother rafts ; tomorrow morning - hell or high water  --  we 'll inflate the two-man kayaks ( " duckies " ) and become one with the river . Over dinner last night at Pack Creek Ranch - tucked between green pastures and Moab 's red rock canyon lands - Barb explained why she decided on a river trip rather than a spa for this year 's reader makeover taking fitness to the next level . " If the river is life , " she muses , " fitness is our life preserver . " Armed with strong bodies and emotional fortitude , we could paddle from the circling eddies of life into the hard , fast water ; forge headlong into tumultuous rapids ; leap high waves with a single bound  --  while braving all manner of creature discomforts , of course : sand in our underpants . Grit in our toothpaste . Creatures that go bump ! in the night . Just for fun , we recite the things we 've left behind . Roxanne 's unleashed herself from her laptop , while Angela has stridden into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate , a Herculean effort I unwittingly foil by smuggling in a box of See 's chocolates for Sheri . Barb 's left her kitties behind , Susan ( at the final hour but not before scouring Moab for fuel ) has decided to brave the wilds without her butane-powered curling iron , while Faerthen ca n't think of anything she 's left behind at all . A tree , a rock , a cloud , the river : Everything she needs is here , she says . We all cheer as the sun finally peeks through the clouds . Later , we pull in for lunch at a Robinson Crusoe beach , then scramble up a precipitous canyon to Moonshiner 's Cabin , a miner 's haunt littered with petrified boots and broken bottles . Nearby a few of us fill our water bottles from a tinkling spring - a miracle of moss in the parched cliff face . Back on the river , the talk drifts to jobs , dreams , men . Roxanne says she already misses her pet rabbit . We laugh and laugh ; one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gently rippling by the time we pull into camp near Dripping Springs that night . As we linger around the campfire after one of Faerthen 's four  --  star meals , Roxanne pulls Sheri aside . " Is this a professional trip or are we all supposed to become best friends ? " she asks earnestly . Later , Barb tells Roxanne whether or not the trip results in deep friendships that last , she should feel safe about opening up - because whatever else happens , we 'll be there for her and remain connected after the trip . tuesday morning Duckies to the Waves Another cold , gray morning . No one really wants to kayak . Roxanne wonders if she can ride in the mother raft , a question that some of us are also privately wondering . Barb says no . We drag out breakfast as long as we can , dawdling in our tents , drinking cup after cup of coffee , praying for the sun . Sheri 's got our number . " OK , duckies , time to fly , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , sweating and giggling . It 's an aerobic component of the trip we had n't counted on . By the time we 're all suited up , the sun 's come out ( a hopeful sign , but I keep on my mittens ) ; Sheri promises it 'll be warmer when we 're actually paddling . Photograph Our daring duo with editor in chief Barb Harris Photograph - Angela and Roxanne relax riverside . // Angela decides to paddle with Kristine , Barb with Susan . Roxanne says she wo n't mind paddling by herself . After a brief demo and safety talk , the duckies launch on their maiden voyage . " Work together now , " clucks Sheri , ever the mother hen , " or you 'll just wear yourselves out . " Barb , a veteran kayaker , and Susan , a novice , establish instant rapport : Their paddling is poetry in motion . Kristine , also experienced , soothes the ruffled feathers of Angela 's propeller stroke , and soon they , too , are scooting along the surface of the river like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls way behind ; by lunch time she 's tired , sore and feeling a little defeated . After lunch I team up with her , but we get nowhere fast . Sheri pulls up behind our duckie with an instant diagnosis : " Stop ! " she says . " You 're both steering ! " I feel hesitant , so Roxanne offers to steer . I sense her quicksilver mind reading the river like a computer  --  clickityclickityclickity  --  sorting , categorizing , scrutinizing the currents as surely as we 've felt her scrutinizing us : " Left ! " " Right ! " " Left ! " " Right ! " " Great ! " " Great ! " " Rest ! " " Drink ! " I paddle like hell , anxious to pull my weight . I even drink when she tells me to . And somehow it all works .

By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted but exhilarated . We are strong , we are invincible , we are ... river goddesses ! Angela is beaming , having mastered steering as well as having kept up with the pack on our half-day hike to Rock Creek , including cliff faces bearing Native American petroglyphs . Roxanne 's also pumped and apparently eager to bolster my lack of paddling confidence . " We make a great team , " she says . " Tomorrow , you should steer . " " My main concern is my hair , which has become so tangled I ca n't even get my Afro comb through it . " I 'll fix it for you , " Roxanne says softly . As she gently wraps my hair in a bun , I sense that something is troubling her . " You know how open you were around the campfire this morning ? " she finally asks . " Was it because these women are strangers and you 'll never see them again , or because you hope you 'll become friends ? " tuesday night Hawks and Swans We spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having the time of our lives . Sheri was right - it is warmer when you 're paddling . But as the sun drops behind the cliffs , we get cold and colder . " Camp 's just around the bend ! " Sheri yells . Unfortunately , another party 's beaten us to it . " The nerve ! " yells Angela . We push on , numb to the bone . Angela and Roxanne are doing their solos tonight , meaning they 'll pitch their tents away from us and spend the evening contemplating the trip . But first we pull Native American medicine cards , each portraying an animal whose characteristics may provide insight into our strengths and weaknesses . Angela gets a hawk , signifying a messenger . Makes sense  --  Angela is nothing if not receptive to new things . Roxanne pulls a swan . " An ugly duckling ? " she wonders . After dinner , we pack them off to their tents with dessert , journals and materials for making medicine bags ( leather pouches used by Native Americans to hold personal amulets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Angela and Roxanne claim they 're eager for a little private time . " If I 'm not in my tent and there 's a boat gone tomorrow , it means I 've gone to Ben &; Jerry 's , " Angela sings . Roxanne looks a little lost . During the course of the evening she wanders out of her tent several times and makes a wide circle around our campfire . " I think she misses us , " says Kristine . Photograph Photograph // Wednesday morning Rapids Baptism " I feel like a million bucks ! " cries Angela as we gather around the morning campfire . " Finally - I slept ! " Then she draws out the beautiful medicine bag she 's made . We 're astonished when she confesses it 's the first thing she 's ever sewn in her entire life . " I had no idea where to begin so I just started and ... it happened , " she says . Tents down , rafts loaded , mittens off , wet suits on . " Not to scare you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but Three Fords , which is just downstream , is one of the biggest rapids of the trip . Be careful . More people have flipped over on this section of river than any other . " Kristine and I will be scouting from the mother raft , so Sheri pairs Angela with Roxanne . " But Kristine and I have telepathy ! " Angela wails , only half-kidding , while Roxanne is quiet ; she 's still feeling pretty ill . As Angela and Roxanne power off , we can almost see the steam rising from their kayak . It does n't take long to figure out who 's won the power struggle for the steering position . " Left ! " " Right ! " " Left ! " " Right ! " " Drink ! " Barb and Susan slip into their kayak too . After a little time on the river , we stop for a hike at McPherson Ranch , where Butch Cassidy and his cronies once hid from the law .

In fact , after Sheri had warned us about the rapids , Barb had quoted an inspirational line from her favorite river book : " It was n't danger they were seeking but life lived full and in the present . " As it turns out , they get both . Plowing headlong into Three Fords Rapid , their raft flips backward and spits Susan out like a watermelon seed . Barb disappears under the raft , followed by Susan and before we know it , both are pinheads adrift in a swirling Maytag . Sheri and Faerthen close in from opposite sides while Roxanne and Angela maneuver around crashing surf to get closer , back-paddling in perfectly silent sync . Before anyone can blink , Faerthen has plucked them out of the river like driftwood and into the mother raft . They are cold , drenched and stunned - but safe . At Faerthen 's suggestion , Barb gets right back in the kayak , while Susan , who hit a rock while waiting to be rescued and has hurt her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wednesday Night Kumbayah We reach camp early that night - the river is picking up speed visibly . Before dinner , Kristine asks us to collect two things , one representing what we 'll leave behind and other what we 'll take home from the trip . Around the campfire we show-and-tell . Angela goes first , holding up a green plant with dead roots : " This represents old fears I 'm leaving behind , " she says . Next , she shows us a stone symbolizing " the reservoir of strength in me I never knew I had . On this trip I learned I have the power to push myself a lot harder in terms of fitness , and the courage to open myself to new experiences . " Then she adds , " I was thinking about the night the other group took our campsite . Even though we were all cold and wet , we just kept paddling . Is n't it funny that if you have a goal , you push toward it no matter what ? But without one you can sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxanne 's turn , she holds up " a rope with knots tied to nothing , " representing what she wants to leave behind . " I tend to cling to things and ways of being that do n't really work , " she says , adding she 's always been competitive and into winning . " But I see the true purpose of the trip for me was not about that or even about river rafting but about forging deeper connections with other women , " she says . Then she holds up a feather . " In search of swan , " she explains . " But I did n't find it , it found me . Kristine said it had my name on it . It represents all of you and everything you 've all seen in me this past week .

If we had kayaked each day with the attitude that we would stop when we reached exhaustion , we would have stopped vife miles before our destination . Instead , we had specific campsites ( goals ) to reach at the end of each day , which gave us a reason to keep paddling . This lesson can be translated into achieving greater fitness , personal and career goals . Get specific ! If there is a specific destination to be reached , the mind and body will work in tandem to accomplish it .  --  Angela Babb Footnote Note : See this months Editor 's Letter for information on two customized river trips being offered next June to Shape readers . // <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
