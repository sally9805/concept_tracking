Happy Thoughts on a Sunny Day in New York City // Galileo described the universe in his most famous line : " This grand book is written in the language of mathematics , and its characters are triangles , circles , and other geometrical figures . " Why should the laws of nature be subject to statement in such elegantly basic algebra ? Why does gravity work by the principle of inverse squares ? Why do simple geometrics pervade nature  --  from the hexagons of the honeycomb , to the complex architecture of crystals ? D'Arcy Thompson , author of Growth and Form and my earliest intellectual hero ( along with my father and Charles Darwin ) , wrote that " the harmony of the world is made manifest in Form and Number , and the heart and soul and all the poetry of Natural Philosophy are embodied in the concept of math ematical beauty . " Many scientists , if only to coin a striking metaphor , depict a creating God as a mathematician from the realm of Plato or Pythagoras . The physicist James Jeans wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician . " // But much of nature is messy and multifarious , markedly resistant to simple mathematical expression ( at least before fractals gave us a way to formulate the complexities of a mountaintop , a coastline , or a leaf ) . And other scientists have developed equally striking metaphors about a creator who revels in the unquantifiable details  --  as in J. B. S. Haldane 's famous quip ( see essay 29 ) that God must have an inordinate fondness for beetles . // We have , in many respects , been oversold on the mathematical precision of nature . Even the preeminent field for abstract , quantified beauty  --  a domain whose very name , celestial mechanics , seems to evoke ethereal harmony  --  includes ever so many awfully messy and downright inconvenient irregularities . Why , for example , could n't God have arranged some simple and decent proportionality between the earth 's axial rotation and solar revolution ? Why did n't he give the year a nice even number of days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendars ? Why 365 days and almost ( but not quite ) an extra quarter ?  --  so that we have to add a leap day every fourth time round , but remove it again every hundred years ( because God ordained a little less than an extra quarter after 365 ) , except for every four hundred years when we put it back again . ( And thus , if you penetrated that sentence , you will grasp why 2000 will be a leap year , even if , among some purists , it will not mark a millennium  --  see next essay . // Nature also mocks our attempt to encase her in a Platonic straitjacket by establishing an almost laughably fortuitous reason for some apparent , highly visible regularities that have played a major role in human history . In my favorite example , much discussed by many commentators , solar and lunar eclipses produce a gorgeously precise and tight fit ( as the moon 's shadow snugly covers the sun and vice versa ) . Must not such exactitude be explicitly arranged , or at least arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of nature ? But the effect is only a happenstance of history . The sun 's diameter is about four hundred times larger than the moon 's . But the sun is also about four hundred times more distant  --  so their discs appear the same size to an observer on earth . ( Now consider how much of human mythology rests upon an image of two guardians , intimately related by their common size : " And God made two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night . " ) // When nature so mocks us , she often comes clean every once in a while , as if to offer confession for such a sublime joke . On May 10 , 1994 , a rare form of solar eclipse , far less spectacular than the conventional lid of darkness , but immensely fascinating for its own more subtle strangeness , enveloped much of North America . The moon 's distance from the earth varies quite a bit during its revolution ( planetary orbits are also not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If a solar eclipse occurs when the moon lies at maximal distance from the earth , then the lunar shadow does not fully cover the sun 's disc . At totality , therefore , a ring of bright light remains at the sun 's periphery . Such eclipses are called annular , from a Latin word for " ring . " ( Annular eclipses are much less spectacular than total eclipses at normal lunar distances , for a ring of bright sunshine still yields substantial light  --  as much or more than on an ordinary cloudy day  --  while the sky turns off as if God threw a light switch when the moon 's larger disc fully covers the sun . // I was angry with myself on May 10 . The eclipse was eighty-eight percent complete at my Boston home , while totality beckoned only an hour or two north from Concord , New Hampshire , and many other pleasant sites throughout New England . The next annular eclipse in New England will occur on July 23 , 2093 , long past my watch  --  so May 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I ordered all my students to drive into the region of totality on pain of instant expulsion . ( Professors  --  enjoying these odd moments of surcease from Shaw 's observation that those who can , do ; while those who ca n't , teach  --  really do revel in such application of limited power . I so ordered , and not a one of them went-to their eternal shame , but otherwise without consequence . ) Meanwhile , duty-bound to honor a commitment made before I heard about the eclipse , I went south to New York City , toward less solar coverage by an already compromised lunar shadow . // Many things keep us going in this vale of tears  --  a baby 's smile , Bach 's B-minor Mass , a decent bagel . Every once in a while , as if to grant us the courage to go on , the powers that be turn one of life 's little disasters into a bit of joy or an episode of instruction . The Lord of the ( Partial ) Ring must have been smiling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sour mood to my natal city of New York and then rewarded me with a better experience than totality in Concord could ever have provided . // I love pristine nature , but I am a humanist at heart , and I revel more in complex interactions between fellow members of Homo sapiens and the great external world . Now think of every stereotype you hold about New Yorkers . ( They are untrue , of course , but culturally powerful as a recognized type or icon nonetheless . ) New Yorkers are harried , selfcentered , cynical , rushed , acquisitive , uncurious , uncommunicative , and downright nasty to all humans who can not be wheedled or manipulated for material gain . Right ? Of course , as all Americans know , even those who have never been east of the Mississippi ! A solar eclipse must therefore rank as the last thing that could ever intrigue a real New Yorker . I mean , gim me a break mister . You want me to stop what I 'm doing and look into the sky  --  at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own light bulb . // Yet , as Joshua once stopped the sun over Gibeon , New York City returned the compliment on May 10 . In midtown Manhattan , in the middle of a busy working day , New York stopped to watch the sun . Let me not exaggerate . Many folks just went on about their business , as the human tide of midday swept down Seventh Avenue . But large knots of eclipse watchers also stood their ground on every street . What features in this less spectacular version of the general phenomenon  --  partial and annular , rather than total and completely covered  --  could have inspired the interest of New Yorkers ? Consider two aspects of this remarkable event . // First , in this age of artificially induced full-body shake-me-ups , from rollercoasters to all the electronic powers of film , video games , and amplified sound , we hardly think that anything so subtle , albeit pervasive , as the character of surrounding sunlight could move our passions , or even invite our notice ( but then the Impressionist painters did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It does not get very dark when the sun is occluded by eighty percent on a bright day ; an ordinary cloud cover reduces visibility by more than this . Thus , the sky did not darken precipitously over New York on May 10 . But we are exquisitely sensitive to the usual character of light , even though we may not explicitly credit our awareness , and may not be able even to state what feels so odd . // It did not , I repeat , get very dark over New York , but the cloudless sky implied brightness , and the day turned eerily somber , while sunlight continued to reign  --  and people noticed , and trembled ever so slightly . " Moses and the children of Israel " sang a song to God to praise the stunning power of altered celestial events ( Exodus , chapter 15 ) : " The people shall hear and be afraid . . . the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them . . . they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so New York , mightier by far and incomparably more sophisticated than these old kingdoms of the Middle East , noticed and stood still as a sky full of daylight darkened to the level of a clearly nonexistent thunderstorm . A woman said to her friend , " Holy shit , either the world is about to end , or it 's going to rain  --  and it sure as hell ai n't gon na rain . " // Second , the sight of a crescent sun is so unusual , so outside our daily experience , that people do pause to notice , and wonder . If the first phenomenon , eerie ( if slight ) darkness , impelled a kind of visceral attention , the crescent sun , by contrast , provoked a more intellectual response . // At every eclipse , official purveyors of the news deluge us with warnings about grave dangers to our sight should we stare at the eclipsing sun . Do n't look up , even for a moment . The sun will burn a painless hole in your retina faster than masturbating boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do understand why such exaggerations must be presented . Staring at the sun for minutes on end is a very bad idea and can have all the consequences stated in eclipse warnings  --  so news sources must say , " Do n't look at all , " in order to impart sufficient fear for preventing these longer starings . So strident are these warnings that many people actually come to believe in a special power of eclipse light to do such harm . But one can , of course , stare directly at the sun for a moment without danger on all days , both regular and eclipsed . After all , we do glance inadvertently into the sun 's disc every once in a while , and we do not go blind . // But most people , and quite rightly , did not look directly at the sun , and took official advice for observation by a clever set of devices for filtering or projecting images . And I became grateful for this panoply of strategies during my humanistic " field trip " for science through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion and encourage sharing , thus helping to forge the eclipse community . // Some people look up through filters . A young man had prepared several strips of overdeveloped film , and he passed them around , a double layer for each observer ( as the newspapers had advised ) , to all interested parties . A welder on 53rd Street spent his work break sharing his goggles with the gathering crowd . // Others took advantage of a wonderful phenomenon in optics , using the principle that almost any small hole or space will act as a pinhole camera to project the image of the crescent sun . Here New York City even holds an advantage over the country  --  for an image projects badly upon rumpled ground , but ever so well against a smooth white sidewalk . New York is such a wondrous mixture of colors , classes , dress , and activity ( I have seen many cities more beautiful and more exotic , but none more diverse ) . But we so rarely come together , for what can transcend our differences and forge common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elegant or literal than the pervasive sun itself ? // On 58th Street , a West Indian janitor in his work clothes stood in front of an apartment building , where a ripped awning contained several small holes , each projecting a beautiful image of the crescent sun upon the sidewalk . The janitor , acting the part of a carnival barker , gathered in the passersby under his awning to see the grand sight , gratis of course . At the next building , like the proprietor of the adjacent stall at the same carnival , an Asian man pierced holes in envelopes , sheets of paper , and manila folders , showing people how to project the sun 's image upon the ground  --  again for free and for the sheer pleasure of sharing . // People gathered on every street to show off their newly discovered devices for projecting images . Trees attracted the greatest crowds , for the spaces between leaves act as little cameras , and hundreds of dancing crescent suns appeared on the sidewalk amid the shadows of branches and leaves . One woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held up her hand into the path of sunlight at the eclipse 's acme , and a crescent image appeared at the bottom of the space between each pair of adjacent fingers . She squealed with delight , and the people around her cheered . A boy then took off his adjustable baseball cap , unsnapped the connecting band , and projected a sun through each tiny hole of the band . And again , the people cheered . // I have watched eclipses with relish for all my conscious life . Like all devotees , I have my favorite stories and main events . I remember my best lunar eclipse , seen when I was a teenager from the twenty-fifth floor of a friend 's apartment , high over Manhattan . The fully covered moon often turns dark , but may also glow with a variety of colors . On this night the entire disc of the eclipsed moon turned red , a deep , dark red that I had never seen in the heavens , or perhaps even on earth . And I understood that two verses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipses , not abstract scare stories of eschatology ( I played washtub bass in a folk group at the time , and we often performed this song ) : " When the sun refuse to shine . . . when the moon turns red with blood ; oh Lord , I want to be in that number , when the saints go marching in "  --  a description , after all , of the Last Judgment , when eclipses will accompany the panoply of awful events . Did not the prophet Joel ( 2:31 ) also speak as an astronomer in citing the same image for the same purpose " The sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come . " // And I remember , for how can one blessed with an opportunity to witness this most spectacular of all celestial events ever forget , the total solar eclipse of early 1970 . Our department rented a fishing boat to sail off Nantucket , the only bit of New England real estate privileged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon 's shadow fully cover the sun ; I thrilled at a chance to observe the sun 's corona . But I had not understood the most awesome phenomenon of all . We live in a natural world of shadings . Even catastrophes have foreshadowings ; clouds precede thunderstorms , and tornadoes can be seen in the distance . But when the sun enters total eclipse , the sky turns off as if a celestial janitor threw a switch . For the sun is powerful , and a fraction of one percent of sunlight is daytime , while totality is nighttime  --  and the transition is a moment , a twinkling of an eye . The sky turned off , and my infant son cried in my arms . // We hear so many dire warnings about the poor quality of science teaching in our schools , so many lamentations over the profound ignorance of most Americans about nearly any phenomenon of the natural world . Perhaps these jeremiads have validity ; half of my own students could not explain to me why our planet has seasons . Surely we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of education could be more important . // But I am convinced that the problem does not arise from lack of interest . Such a false charge is often made amid the litany of correct accusations mentioned in the last paragraph . Interest is immense , but not always expressed as activity traditionally called science or ranked among its pursuits ( and our misattribution therefore arises from our inadequate taxonomies of intellectual enterprise ) . My colleague Phil Morrison is fond of cataloguing the large number of common activities requiring a good deal of scientific understanding , but not usually so classified : the astronomical knowledge of people who build and maintain telescopes ; the deep botanical experience of members in gardening clubs ( a fine example of power concentrated in older women ) ; or even the people who frequent racetracks and bet intelligently on horses , for misunderstanding of probabililty , may be the greatest of all general impediments to scientific literacy . // May I now add to this list the aggregate intellectual power ( how I wish we could quantify it ) of all the dinosaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year-old kids in America today . And also the accumulated joy and pleasure of millions upon millions of Americans who paused to watch the sun and to wonder on May 10 , 1994 . New York City was the best place to be on that date ; my faith in raw interest is fully affirmed  --  and raw interest is the substrate and sine qua non of any real reform in education and larger understanding . // We often argue that only misfortune can bring us together . We do help each other during snowstorms ; we do open our hearts and our houses to victims of an immediate disaster in our vicinity ; we will search all night in the woods for a lost child we do not know . All these observations properly give us hope about common humanity in a world more often characterized by thoughtlessness , self-serving action , and even downright cruelty . But we also suppose that only disaster can provoke this effect , never pleasure , and certainly not intellectual as opposed to purely visceral delight . But interest and curiosity can also bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature and spontaneously talking about the sun somehow give me more hope than our joint courage in times of crisis can provide , even though unity in disaster may make me cry in sublime appreciation , while the bonding of eclipses only makes me smile . // And so I end this essay by quoting the greatest of all tributes to the sun . I have often stated my personal theory about popular writing in science . I divide this genre into two modes , which I call Galilean , for intellectual essays about nature 's puzzles , and Franciscan , for lyrical pieces about nature 's beauty . I honor Galileo for writing his two major works as dialogues in Italian , and therefore addressed to all thinking people in his orbit , and not in the formal Latin of churches and universities . And I honor Saint Francis of Assisi for his tributes to nature 's loveliness. // I am an unrepentant Galilean . I work in a tradition extending from the master himself , to Thomas Henry Huxley in the last century , down to J. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly admire Franciscan lyricism , but I do n't know how to write in that mode . I began this essay with a quotation from the eponymous hero of my literary bloodline , Galileo himself . But my essay talks about the power of the sun to unify our diverse cultures and concerns , so I must end with a man I have never quoted before in these columns , the eponym of the other style  --  Saint Francis of Assisi . Saint Francis composed his beautiful " Canticle of Brother Sun " in 1225 . He wrote in the Umbrian dialect of his local people , and his poem is often regarded as the first preserved in any modern language : // Brother Sun , who brings the day . . . // How beautiful is he , how radiant in all his splendor !
