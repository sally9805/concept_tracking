IT WAS A MELODRAMATIC END TO WHAT HAD been a life of small and little-noted defeats . Frank Eugene Corder spent the hours of Sunday , Sept. 11 , at the seedy Keyser 's Motel in Aberdeen , Md. , sitting outside Room 6 drinking beer , smoking crack and talking with fellow lodgers about how lonely he had been since his wife threw him out of their house three weeks earlier . At one point , Corder , 38 , said he " wanted to buy a Harley motorcycle and just take off . " Then he invited his friend Cindy Jianniney to go for an airplane ride . " We were sitting on the steps here , and he says , " You ever been up in a plane ? ' ' " recalls Jianniney , 38 , a part-time manager at the motel . " And I says , " No , the Lord built my ass low to the ground  --  and that 's where I 'm gon na keep it . ' ' " The last thing anyone remembers Corder saying , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was , " See you later  --  I 'm gon na go fly my plane . " In fact , Corder did n't have a plane , but that was no problem . In the early hours of Monday , Sept. 12 , Corder stole a single-engine Cessna 150 two-seater at the Harford County Airpark in Aberdeen , then flew 65 miles south to Washington , into the two-square-mile no-fly zone around the nation 's capital and straight into the side of the White House . Undetected by the Secret Service until the final seconds , Corder died in a jumble of twisted fuselage and shattered glass , just 30 feet from the President 's second-floor bedroom window . Initial autopsy results found traces of alcohol and cocaine in his blood . Although the Clintons were asleep across the street at Blair House , where they were staying temporarily during routine renovations to their living quarters , the crash was a frightening  --  and embarrassing  --  breach of government security . Though the investigation into precisely what occurred that night is ongoing , the plane did appear on the radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated White House airspace  --  but at 2 a.m. no one was monitoring the radar , and the White House was not notified . None of the Stinger antiaircraft missiles thought to be positioned on top of the White House were fired at the plane . ( Secret Service agents might be loath to use such weapons under any circumstances because if these heat-seeking missiles miss their first target , they will go for the next source of heat  --  which could include other airplanes flying in and out of National Airport . ) But about any possible security mix-ups , Sen. Dennis DeConcini , chairman of the Senate subcommittee that funds the Secret Service , said , " They 're going to correct that real quick , I think . " The Cessna , which also tore through a magnolia tree planted by Andrew Jackson in 1832 , was the first airplane to get close to the White House . But Corder was not the first intruder to try to break into the White House grounds . Over the years several people have tried to scale White House fences or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in 1974 , Army Pvt . Robert Preston landed a helicopter on the South Lawn before Secret Service agents wounded him with shotgun blasts . " You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that if somebody wants to crash an airplane into the White House , he can do it , " says author Tom Clancy , whose newest best-seller , Debt of Honor , includes a scene in which a jet violates Washington 's no-fly zone . " But Clinton 's life is in far more danger when he goes jogging in the morning . " Corder 's goal , however , does not appear to have been an attempt on the President 's life . Instead , say relatives , he was driven by a suicidal despair over the direction his own life was taking . The younger son of Dorothy Corder , a 63-year-old housewife in bad health , and her late husband , William , an airplane mechanic and amateur pilot who passed on his love of flying , Frank Corder had always felt like the " black sheep " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Maryland native , he dropped out of Aberdeen High School in 10th grade ( though he later earned his GED ) and in 1975 was honorably discharged from the Army after nine months because of his lackluster performance . He worked as a truck driver and a house builder , and a few years ago he and his older brother John , 41 , started a trucking business , only to see it collapse last year . Corder had also battled drug and alcohol problems for some time . After his father died of cancer last year , Corder served 30 days in jail for drunk driving . And his lengthy rap sheet includes another arrest for drunk driving and two for theft within the last 36 months . At the time of his death , he was on probation for possession of marijuana and driving with open bottles of liquor in his car . And according to residents of Keyser 's Motel , he stole a $400 television set from his room the weekend before he died and sold it to buy drugs . Last year he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , but , says George , a nurse 's aide at the hospital , " every time he had something that was upsetting in his life , he slid off the wagon again . " The final blow appears to have been the collapse of his on-again , off-again 10-year marriage to his third wife , Lydia , 60 , a nurse at the Perry Point hospital . ( Both his previous marriages had ended in divorce ; he has a 17-year-old daughter from the first of these . ) " He was so depressed the three weeks before he died , " says his aunt Edith Dishman . " He did n't have a clear mind to say , " I need help . ' ' " But he had often considered suicide . " He told me numerous times that when he was under the influence , he just did n't want to live , " says George . And he knew just how he wanted to go . According to John , Frank had been fascinated by the 1987 episode in which West German teenager Mathias Rust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow 's Red Square . During a party a year ago , John recalls Frank saying , " If you 're going to kill yourself , the way to do it is to take an airplane and crash it into the White House . " Of course , John says , " everybody thought he was joking . " Now family members are saddened , if not entirely shocked , by Corder 's dramatic end . " His mother is all broke up , " says Corder 's nephew Scott , 16 . " She helped Frank out more than anybody , and she knew it was going to happen sooner or late . " And though they are all horrified that Corder chose to involve the White House , Scott says , " I do n't think he wanted to hurt the President . I just think he wanted to die ; I think he wanted to die hard . " <p>
