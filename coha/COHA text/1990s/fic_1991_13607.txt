DR . CHREODE You 've stuffed yourself . He wipes her mouth . I used to love the chocolate traces hidden in the corners of your lips when you came home late from the lab . You looked so sweetly guilty then . Soul . It 's an archaic concept , after all . A man does n't actually have a soul . It 's an idea . A thought . A chemical reaction in the brain .

Ladies and Gentlemen , Mr. President , distinguished members of the National Academy of Science , welcome to this auspicious gathering . applause This meeting marks a very special occasion . We gather together to celebrate the completion of the Human Genome Mapping Project . ( applause ) We now know the precise location and the complete DNA sequence of each of the 100,000 human genes . We can now write down in exact detail all the genetic instructions for making a complete human being . ( applause , again . He holds up his hands for silence . ) Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I know , it 's absolutely intoxicating . Throughout the scene , Haila makes her remarks and elicits responses as " under-talk " during the formal speeches of the scientists . The whispered dialogue is amplified and is delivered simultaneously with the speeches. p. 13 DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they all are . spotting a late arrival There she is ! Stand up and wave to her , Edward ! Theodora . Theodora Forensic , over here . DR . FORENSIC stumbling across audience feet to them How terrible to be late . Forgive me , please . I was caught up in the lab . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Theodora Forensic , my new post doc. , meet Edward Chreode , my son . DR . FORENSIC Dr. Chreode , I 'm so very glad to meet you . DR . CHREODE Dr. Forensic , my pleasure . Here , sit here . We 've saved a seat on the other side of mother . DR . FORENSIC Thank you . How kind of you , Dr. Gudenschmartzer . Have I missed much ? DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER The usual self-congratulatory clap-trap . DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST Together scientific visionaries , venture capitalists , and the United States Government joined forces to create what I think we must all agree is the most significant accomplishment of the twentieth century . The map of the human genome is the first step in affording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 14 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER And what will they do now ? Make better people . DR . FORENSIC Oh , yes . Do n't you think so . . . DR . CHREODE I think there 's something essential we have n't even formulated yet . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER If that 's what you really think stop blathering about it , Edward , and get to work . DR . FORENSIC I 'm afraid I do n't follow what you're. . . " hush " sounds from the audience . DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST Like the Manhattan Project of the 1940 's , the Human Genome project of the 1990 's has put America first in the areas of visionary scientific breakthrough , major technological accomplishment and renewed economic edge over the rest of the industrialized world . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER The Manhattan Project was the first scientific concentration camp in this country ; this genome project has been the second . DR . CHREODE Mother . . . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Edward . . . you 've done nothing for the past ten years but count proteins . DR . FORENSIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the eminent research scientists who joined forces to complete this massive project in record time , no one man deserves our thanks more than Dr. Philbert Wallace . applause DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Philbert Wallace is a self-serving fool . DR . CHREODE Mother , please , you 're not having breakfast with me , you 're in a crowded room . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Where I am does not alter the character of Philbert Wallace one slight bit . DR . CHREODE Hush . DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST Philbert Wallace , three time Nobel Prize winning scientist and fortune 500 CEO who from his adjacent laboratories at this great university and offices at Generecombo , Inc. directed the mapping of more of the human genome than any other senior researcher . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I taught him everything he knows about science . I suppose his own mother is responsible for the corruption of his character . DR . FORENSIC Gene alteration is my special area of interest . Are you deeply involved , Dr. Chreode ? DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER He sequenced genes ad nauseuam . It 's miraculous his brain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , for god 's sake , you ca n't keep talking like this . . . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Do n't forget , I spoke up against Hitler in ' 34 . I criticized his mad eugenics program then and I did my time in a camp because of it . DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST Dr. Ladies and gentlemen . Distinguished fellows of the National Academy of Science , may I present to you , Dr. Philbert Wallace . As the applause increases , and during the following dialogue , the actor who had played the DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST turns around and takes off moustache or beard , changes ties , etc. , becoming PHILBERT WALLCE , when the transformation is complete he begins his speech . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Our kind ought to be unworldly , monkish . Philbert 's a master politician . It 's dangerous . DR . CHREODE Mother , please , this is n't Germany ; it 's not 1934 . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Philbert 's had Congress eating out of hands for the past 10 years , and they 've eaten plenty of shit . enormous applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Philbert Wallace speaks with studied confidence and a smooth , ingratiating manner . He has learned how to win an audience. p. 17 DR . WALLACE My fellow colleagues in this great enterprise , thank you very much for your warm enthusiastic welcome . You know , it 's been said that a man has nothing until he has won the respect of his peers . If that 's so , then I must be among the very richest men in the world . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER He 's made a fucking fortune off of science . DR . CHREODE Will you try to listen to Philbert 's speech . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER The arrogance appalls me . The " human genome " as if there were some single one . DR . CHREODE Yes , well did it ever occur to you that insults are n't terribly effective ? DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Mark my words , Edward Chreode , mark my words . A entirely new theoretical formulation is what 's needed . DR . CHREODE That 's exactly what I 'm working toward . A new vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop doing shit work for Philbert Wallace . DR . CHREODE How else does one fund oneself ? DR . WALLACE You know it was n't always this way . I remember days and weeks and months of people telling me I was nuts , that the human genome could n't be mapped , that we did n't have the technology necessary to master such a task . Then there were the arduous and depressing Congressional hearings spent answering our critics , the environmentalists , the feminists , the Catholic Church , even those few doubters within our ranks , people and organizations who for their own , I 'm certain , honorable motives cling to the out-moded notion that human beings are not equipped to interfere with nature and that human knowledge itself ought to be limited . Well , let me tell you something right here and now , human knowledge is not limitable . Human knowledge is a God given gift and we are here on this earth in order to carry out the greatest of all human projects , to join hands with nature , not against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause p. 18 DR . FORENSIC Oh , I 'm so excited to be sitting here , at this moment ! Now that the genome has been mapped , human gene alteration is around the corner . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Have you read any history along with all that science ? DR . FORENSIC We 're making history today . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Regrettably . DR . CHREODE Hush . He 's about to acknowledge his colleagues . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Memory . Memory ! Where , in what gene , does the collective memory reside ? an amplified " Shushhh " , as if from all the people seated around Haila DR . CHREODE Mother , you 've got to be quiet now . DR . WALLACE Now , let me tell you something you might not already know . I was n't always a research scientist . No , once I was a humble resident on a hospital ward and I saw , day in and day out , the suffering of human beings . I saw cancer deaths , heart attack deaths , deaths by stroke , deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cystic Fibrosis , Tae Sachs . One Christmas eve , my esteemed friends and colleagues , I lost four beautiful children to the ravages of leukemia . The deaths of those four innocent children on Christmas Eve drove me into the lab , ladies and gentlemen , fellow scientists . The deaths of those four innocent babes led me to devote the rest of my life to the two-pronged task of curing and preventing genetic defects in our young . Yes , I promised myself I would not rest until the human genome had been mapped . And I have not rested and we have brought this project home a full five years ahead of schedule . ( applause ) And now that this enormous task has been accomplished , I want to renew my promise , in front of you and with you . I will not rest until the molecular biology community has learned how to prevent or to correct each and every terrible trick the human gene pool persists in playing on human beings . Gene alteration is the answer , ladies and gentlemen . Once we learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands . Gene alteration will allow us to cure , in utero or in vitro , any of the over 10,000 genetic maladies that are currently detectable , and many other malfunctions we do n't even label as diseases , yet . With gene alteration , every couple 's natural longing to achieve the best possible genetic make-up for each of their off-spring will become a glorious reality . Once parents , acting in concert with The Recombinant DNA Advisory Commission are actually able to choose the physical and intellectual characteristics of their off-spring who can doubt that a world of gods and goddesses awaits us ? With gene alteration techniques under our belts , we will have become impervious to illness , to defects and , ultimately , even to death . Our goal is nothing less than genetic perfection for every American . This and only this is the great work before us. deafening applause Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much . p. 19 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Reach into my bag , Edward Chreode ; I 've brought some ripe tomatoes just for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is here . I wo n't let you humiliate yourself like this . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Theodora , hand me my tomatoes . The three of them begin to move out of the auditorium ; Edward wheels his mother 's chair across the floor in front of the stage , where the following dialogue is played . DR . FORENSIC It 's so inspiring , is n't it , Dr. Chreode . Philbert Wallace is brilliant . Genetic Perfection . A disease free world . Such a challenge is worth an entire lonely lifetime in a lab . DR . CHREODE You 've been bred to the task , have n't you ? DR . FORENSIC You mean because I was born from two sperm inserted into an egg from which all the genetic material except the extra X had been previously removed . My fathers are feminist men . They made a bet with other less enlightened Nobel Prize winners that a woman might for once make a lasting mark on science . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER After all these years , my accomplishments are n't seen as major . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to suggest . . . Your work on memory is supreme . She bends enthusiastically over HAILA 's chair , paying homage . You are the most highly esteemed woman scientist alive , Dr. Gudenschmartzer . That 's why I 'm here . I felt the need of a strong female influence since I never had a mother . I want to be a credit to my sex . I intend to perfect gene alteration techniques . For a moment , THEODORA , her hand on her breast , gazes out into her glorious future. p. 20 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Listen to her , Edward , you need guts like that . DR . FORENSIC But you were involved in the genome mapping project were n't you , Dr. Chreode . DR . CHREODE Call me , Edward Chreode , please . My real work is something else . My wonderings are a bit diffuse right now . Difficult to pin down . But the speculations are endlessly fascinating . I do believe I 'm on to something . DR . FORENSIC Could you introduce me to Dr. Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . I have some rather concrete ideas for experiments . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER She 'll marry the first Nobel Prize winner who asks her . She 'll get money , patronage , a lab. of her own ; it all comes attached to his penis . And you , Edward , will never find a brilliant wife until you win the Prize . DR . CHREODE Mother , I 'm certain Dr. Forensic and I. . . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Ignoring Edward , to Theodora I created Edward Chreode by myself . He 's fatherless . So that I might present a masculine antidote to their pseudo-scientific twaddle and gibberish . A compassionate man with a brain . That 's what I meant him to be . EDWARD wheels his mother off-stage ; THEODORA follows . The rest of the speech is heard as if it took place in the hall leading to the laboratory doors . A feelingful soul with a speculative flare . Edward , my dear , self-assertion comes so very hard to you . But now the time has come for you to take a bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wheel me back to the lab . Edward , Theodora , I feel the blood begin to thunder in my veins . We have important work ahead . THEODORA opens the door to HAILA 'S lab. @x HAILA GUDENSCHMARTZER is wheeled in the door of her lab by THEODORA FORENSIC . HAILA is still talking . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I am locating the exact spot where memory is stored within the brain . I am very , very close to the solution , now . HAILA holds up some papers containing research results . THEODORA eyes them eagerly as she shuts the door with one hand . PHILBERT opens the door just as she shuts it . DR . WALLACE Haila , I need your ear . HAILA quickly hides her research . THEODORA gapes at PHILBERT , her " hero " , but sees she is not expected to stay as HAILA waves her away and she exits awkwardly . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Pah . Philbert Wallace . When did you ever need anything from me ? Except my knowledge and that you have pilfered , Philbert , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the best teacher I ever had . I 'm your protg . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER The best teacher of the biggest genetic mogul in the nation is struggling away , as always , in an under-equipped laboratory , underfunded , understaffed , underrespected . DR . WALLACE Haila , gene alteration is around the corner . I need your enthusiastic endorsement of my research program . PHILBERT takes the endorsement paper from his right lab coat pocket , flourishes it at her . She waves it away ; she is n't going to sign. p. 23 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I thought your speech was a piece of shit , by the way . DR . WALLACE Always the kind word from you , Haila , always the kind word . You 'll never understand how much your disapproval hurts me . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I 've offended you , Philbert , that 's why my grants do n't come through ? DR . WALLACE I always vote in your favor . I 'm a loyal man , Haila . Let 's face it , you have n't been hot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philbert . And you 've always known how hot I 've always been . DR . WALLACE Your lab is almost out of money . It 's been a long time since you published anything . Now , if you do n't want to turn your attention to gene alteration , it might finally be just the right moment for you to retire . I 'll plan the festivities myself . Retire in style , o.k. ? PHILBERT puts the endorsement paper back into his pocket . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Bullshit , Philbert . You ask that young genius who has just apprenticed herself to me . She understands better than any of you how close I am to solving the secret of memory --  by myself . When I publish my results in a few months you wo n't even bother to read what I 've found . I 'm a woman . What could I know ? I might even have been menstruating , polluting my results with unclean blood . That 's how scientific you and your woman-hating tribe are . I still do menstruate , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . I still menstruate because I 'm still fertile . Not a one of you read the paper explaining how I accomplished that . You 're too busy making babies in petrie dishes . p. 24 DR . WALLACE What did you say , Haila ? DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I still menstruate . I still bleed . DR . WALLACE I 'll take you out for dinner , you can tell me about your private life . Right now , let 's talk science . Let 's talk brain , mind , memory . At the Top of the Sixes , I 'll get us a nice table , you can continue your feminist diatribe over the beef . Maybe my speech was a little gisty , after all . I was n't altogether pleased . Maybe I should have come right out and said all we need from the whole messy process are the eggs . Now what did you say about memory ? DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER You keep your hands off of my eggs , Philbert Wallace . I can still conceive quite nicely on my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid strapped to my belly , within a week . I would prove it to you , if I was able to find a man with genetic and moral fiber equal to my own . But you all have always been swine . In a month , I 'll understand human memory . DR . WALLACE Haila , if you were n't such a damn fine scientist I 'd never be able to put up with you . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER In a month , I 'll know exactly where and how memory is stored within the brain . I 'm on the verge of understanding everything . p. 25 DR . WALLACE That 's the stuff , Haila . Get me a full report today . I 'll put you on full retainer at Generecombo , Inc . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Do n't patronize me , young man . Give me the money I need because of my brilliant mind . Triumphantly , HAILA hands HIM the proof , her research results . He takes the papers , reads ; becomes convinced and excited . Immediately he 's off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WALLACE The control of human memory . That 's marketable . We win the public 's sympathy by offering it up as a cure for Alzheimer 's disease ( which I forgot , by the way , to mention in my speech ) . An ethics committee will be convened by the boys in Congress . Who is worthy of having a memory , that sort of thing . Meanwhile , who can resist ? It 's science . It 's progress . It 's truth . Haila , I knew you 'd come through for me in the end . Philbert offers his hand for her to shake . She refuses , swings her chair away . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Not so fast , Philbert Wallace , I want the Nobel Prize for this . My life 's work . I want to die with the Prize in my hand . I want my eggs frozen alongside all that sperm in the Nobel sperm bank . I want equality at last . DR . WALLACE Haila , I 'm offering you millions . p. 26 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the results again . Decides . DR . WALLACE O.k. , o.k . I 'll see what I can do . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER So you think I 'm hot , at last , Philbert . DR . WALLACE Haila , there 's no one in science whose integrity and accomplishments I admire more . You 've stuck to the good , hard , theoretical work ; you 've never profiteered off of science . You 're a well known supporter of liberal causes ; you 're an old line feminist , a refugee from Hitler and a single mother to boot . You 've got principles , Haila . You deserve the Nobel Prize . I 'm glad to have you on our team . He offers his hand , again . This time she takes it . They shake . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER And you , Philbert , are a slippery , self-important penis who was badly toilet trained . But , I 'm glad to be included on your team . DR .

WALLACE This is Generecombo 's standard option agreement . It gives the company complete rights to market any and all memory control products we invent based upon your pure research . It also gives you quite a handsome advance . Philbert pencils a large $ figure into the contract . Hands it to her. p. 27 DR . WALLACE Sign it . HAILA reads quickly , signs . He takes it back . DR . WALLACE And , Haila , no more displays like the one I witnessed at my speech . He comes quite close to her You may humiliate me in private only . He pulls back and begins to pace You know , Haila , I was disappointed in my speech , myself . It lacked nerve . The truth is I got scared . I cut out the most radical part .

If so , genetic material would be removed from the depository , mated suitably , and implanted into a surrogate . If not , the genetic material is destroyed . How simple , elegant , direct . But at 3 a.m. , I cut the paragraph out . I should n't have done that , should I ? But HAILA has fallen asleep in her chair . DR . WALLACE Haila , are you listening ? That old trick again . What a pig-headed , impossible woman . He whispers to her sleeping face . You had better not make a fool out of me , Haila . You had better come through ; I 've invested in you .

I 'm not like them at all . DR . SCHNEIDER It 's wrong to cry about that . You ca n't help the way you are . DR . SCHNEIDER Other people have inner lives . They have places they can get to . Places they can hide . Other people have private thoughts . DR . SCHNEIDER Yes , Eduard . Be proud . You 've been asked to give up so much . You can live without an inner life . DR . SCHNEIDER But I must cry . I must grieve . I must mourn . DR . SCHNEIDER Buck up , Eduard . You still look fine . It 's important to pretend . Think of your grandmother . No one ever knew she was a Jew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the right thing . But I 'm not what they say . I remember when I could see the whole distance round the world . I had the whole vision , then . I saw everything . DR . SCHNEIDER So what . Do you think anyone cares about you ? DR . SCHNEIDER Why do you make me cry ? What 's the purpose in that . If I cry , I ca n't feel anything . And I used to have feelings of my own . p. 29 DR . SCHNEIDER Shut up , Eduard , do n't go soft on me . That sort of talk is better unheard . You 're not like other people , Eduard . You do what you 're told . You give what you 're asked . You sacrifice . DR . SCHNEIDER No . Stop . I had an idea . I had a thought . A thought came into my head . This time , this time , I am going to try . I am going to try to show who I am . EDUARD SCHNEIDER writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refute this charge of imbecility with schizophrenic tendencies , since I am capable of writing and of doing arithmetic without error and without outside help . For this reason , I would like to request another physical examination . " DR . WIRTHS ( played by the actor who plays PHILBERT WALLACE ) enters with HAILA , playing herself as a young woman . Dr. Eduard Wirths was soon to become one of the chief doctors , i.e. killers at Auschwitz . Tall , handsome Aryan looks , he is also bizarrely gentle and kindly ( as indeed the real Wriths was known for his compassionate care of patients , even as he oversaw the killing of millions . ) A committed Nazi , devoted husband and father , Wirths believes he is doing his duty purifying the German race . In other words , Wirths is the true split personality , the killer/doctor in one body . Haila 's dream memory intensifies these characteristics ; Wirth 's split is boldly portrayed. p. 30 DR . WIRTHS Good morning Herr Schneider . He takes the letter , pockets it . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraulein Docktor will perform another examination on you . Sterilize him , Fraulein . Inject this caustic substance through the urethra . It will block the testes . Check him in a week . If gangrene has set in , amputate . Do n't be afraid , Herr Schneider . You see , I 've brought you a beautiful young woman doctor . What could possibly go wrong . She 'll be won completely over by your charm . Sterilize him , now , Fraulein . WIRTHS exits DR . SCHNEIDER You are a nice lady . I can see that . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Do n't count your chickens before they hatch . DR . SCHNEIDER That 's just it . I ca n't help doing that . Everyone must . It 's human . I feel that it is . I do n't want to be sterilized . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Whoever put that idea into your head . I 've come to speak with you a bit , take your blood and do a sperm count . Here , masturbate into this jar . DR . SCHNEIDER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I will never marry . I wanted to marry this year . Maybe the woman I love will not want to marry me . I would n't marry except for love . I know how to love , I do . p. 31 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I 've had thirty-nine lovers , I 've given myself five abortions . I 've cured myself three times of pelvic inflammatory disease and of countless yeast infections . I 'm the last woman in Berlin who remembers the erotic life . DR . SCHNEIDER It 's because they found out I have a Jewish grandmother . That 's why they are doing this . I 'm not stupid , you know . I 'm no dumber than lots of them in uniform . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I had a Jewish lover , once . But he asked for too much . DR . SCHNEIDER Maybe you have been hurt in love . Too many times . I 'm a dairy herdsman . I work with cows . But I 've got my dreams . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Yes , yes , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we two could talk . If we could share , well , you wo n't be able to do what they want done . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I 'm here on orders . Routine examination only . DR . SCHNEIDER I could love a woman . I know I could . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER You 're not done . Quickly , finish up before he comes back . It 's a simple mechanical thing . I just need a sperm count . We are doing a comparison rating . Do Jewish men produce more sperm ? It 's pure science . Pure research . p. 32 DR . SCHNEIDER I believe the amount of sperm produced must have to do with the amount of love felt . I believe it 's the passion at the moment of conception which determines the joy in the soul of the unborn . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Now , then , I just must give you this injection She injects his penis with the caustic substance . Sound of machine gun fire . HIS body reacts in a spasm to the pain . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that ? I begged you . I pleaded with you . I looked into your eyes . I shared my dreams . I believed in tenderness . I believed in love . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Buck up , Eduard Schneider . Buck up . These are hard times . None of us does what we want . We are struggling to stay alive . Go home . Forget about this . DR . SCHNEIDER You expect me to forget ? DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Look , I 've saved your sperm . They wanted to destroy it . HAILA looks at the ( imaginary ) sperm-jar . " Why did I save this ? " she silently asks herself . Then she knows . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I 'm going to have a child with this . I 'm going to inject myself . I will sex select . I will make a son . A noble , gentle , brilliant man . A boy-child with your soul , my brains . I 've had counts , classicists , artists , actors , professors of chemistry , biology , physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are the only man I 've desired a child with . p. 33 DR . SCHNEIDER What will become of him ? What will become of my son ? He missed out from the start . Never to feel the shock of collision between egg and sperm . Never to feel the light of my love ? How I sought him everywhere with every thrust , never to hear my shout , my shout of triumph when he was formed ? PW as Wirths returns DR . WIRTHS Finished , Fraulein , I hope . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Yes . Everything is as you wished . DR . WIRTHS We killed two birds with one stone . WIRTHS sends EDUARD SCHNEIDER 's wheel chair rolling towards the double doors , SCHNEIDER disappears . DR . WIRTHS An idiot and a Jew . It must make you feel proud , Fraulein , to be a woman in 1934 , at the forefront of eugenic science . I 'm going to recommend you for promotion . There are some very interesting experiments soon to begin at several major hospitals here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . We are entering a golden age of science . Of racial purification and advanced reproductive techniques . I 'm going to recommend a transfer and a promotion for you . HAILA falls back into her chair , jerks awake , screams . DREAM ENDS DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Edward ! Edward , my son ! EDWARD rushes in . Like many children of concentration camp survivors , he 's been through camp nightmares many times before. p. 34 DR . SCHNEIDER You 're not in the camps , mother , you 're here , in the lab , with me . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER The beatings . My back . My back . The horrible pressure on my spine . DR . SCHNEIDER It 's all over , now . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I ran , I ran . For the last time , I walked by myself . DR . SCHNEIDER You 're safe in the lab with me . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Why , Edward , is it always pain ? Pain so vivid , biting at us ? DR . SCHNEIDER Calm , mother , calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAILA is fully present . An important new thought has come into her head because of the dream and waking moment she just had . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Edward , I 've been wrong . Memory can not be stored solely in the brain . Memory is lodged in the flesh . The body , the organs , the cells , the hormones , the glands feel the memory first , before we are conscious of it . She pauses for a moment , following this thought through to its next question. @x EDWARD CHREODE enters his lab. and begins to work . PHILBERT WALLACE enters just behind . DR . WALLACE Hallo , Edward . DR . CHREODE Philbert , come in . A most impressive speech . DR . WALLACE That 's not what your mother said . DR . CHREODE You know mother , a most difficult one . DR . WALLACE Listen , pal , I 've got a plum for you . Huge contract . Major grant . DR . CHREODE Philbert , that 's very kind . DR . WALLACE Fortunately , I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHREODE I 'm honored , touched . DR . WALLACE Edward , you 're in line for promotion , at last . Only . . . you 've hardly published a thing . You 're not very good at getting grants . DR . CHREODE Well , perhaps . Philbert , I 'm thinking out a major theory . It 's slow work , not easy . DR . WALLACE Edward , I , for one , have faith in you . DR . CHREODE Philbert , I 'm onto something big . p. 36 DR . WALLACE How would you like a small fortune for research ? Prestige ? An inside track on what 's happening , what 's hot ? DR . CHREODE Well , of course . . . DR . WALLACE Fascinating research . Necessary to the U.S. You can do your own thing on the side . Which , by the way , is what ? DR . CHREODE Thoughts far-ranging . Problems of creation and form , mysteries of epigenesis , of regeneration , embryological speculations . How does form come into being for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? Biology 's unsolved problems . Recently , I ca n't quite tell you why , I 've become rather obsessed with the problem of extinction . What happens to the life force of the extinct , or soon to be so ? DR . WALLACE What sort of question is that ? Life force , it 's an archaic concept . DR . CHREODE Your speech led me to thinking that we ought to prepare for future extinctions by freezing the genetic material of endangered species so that we might regenerate them in future times , under more auspicious environmental conditions . DR . WALLACE Perfect , Edward . How soon can you get some general papers out ? I 'll see they 're placed in the environmental magazines . We need precisely this sort of visibility at this great university . It provides you with a perfect cover . EDWARD is thrilled . PHILBERT moves in very close. p. 37 DR . WALLACE Edward , we need your help manufacturing a new , lethal virus ( as a vaccine , of course , as an antidote , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for the Department of Defense . Will you say , " yes ? " DR . CHREODE I do n't think I really could consider that . DR . WALLACE A great deal is at stake . Personally , professionally and for our country . DR . CHREODE This stuff is dangerous . It 's cultured in the E-coli bacterium which lives quite naturally in the human intestine . What if it got out ? DR . WALLACE We build safety doors . Better you be the one than someone less environmentally inclined . DR . CHREODE Oh , I do n't know about that . My mind , at present , is quite occupied . DR . WALLACE This DOD contract will fund your passion , man . If I might be frank , there 's no way the problems you just out-lined will bring in the grants , not with the current administration . No way the current faculty can grant you the promotion . In contrast , slipping a little lethal virus into the e-coli bacterium might help us understand gene alteration ! Be altruistic , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always of yourself . For us , here at this great university , a contract from the DOD is not to be sneezed away . Take an hour to think it over . I 'll pop in again . PHILBERT exits . EDWARD , disappointed and confused , sits down at his desk where he falls immediately to sleep . DREAM MUSIC &amp; LIGHTS . HAILA comes racing in madly in her wheel chair , beginning the Dream Image. ) p. 38 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Edward , I need , I need , I need . I have needs , Edward Chreode , needs . I have needs which must be met . DR . CHREODE Yes , yes , of course . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Give me your legs , Edward Chreode . I need them for mine . HE sits heavily on useless legs . SHE rises and walks . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER You must grab opportunity when it knocks . I rose to the top . By hard work , sacrifice , good common sense . Love , there was no room for love . I had lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand on their own . DR . CHREODE I can , mama , I can stand up . HE tries to pull himself up by holding onto her . SHE brushes him off . HE falls . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER They used me , each one . Weaklings . Sapped my strength . DR . CHREODE Do n't give your legs away , Edward Chreode . No , next time , I wo n't . I did n't really give them up . Not my own two feet . I kept my feet for myself . Legs can regenerate . It 's a marvelous fact . The damaged organ regrows itself . Cut it off . It comes back . Grows again . Cut it off . It returns . What a marvelous fact . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Edward , give me your head . I want to think a thought worthy of me through to the end . EDWARD CHREODE 'S head goes limp on his neck. p. 39 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER It was always so difficult simply to be . To be strong . To be self-willed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shut up Haila . Your son let lethal bacteria leak from his lab . Three hundred thousand innocent civilians are expected to die . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Is Edward all right ? Did Edward survive ? DR . CHREODE Crawls to her Mama , I have collected their genes . The genes of all the condemned are in glass jars underground . DR . WALLACE Luckily , the undernourished , over-medicated , drugged and despised will be first to succumb . Assure the population at large that everything 's fine . DR . CHREODE Out back , beneath the cement , I 've stored all their traits . We will recreate each last one . Babies in their cribs . Octogenarians . Lovers entwined in their beds . I 've stolen their genes to make them again . DR . FORENSIC carrying a baby doll Look at my child . She 's dead . She died . DR . CHREODE Oh , my god , did you take out her genes ? Did you save one of her eggs ? DR . FORENSIC She was a test tube baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you have any idea of what I went through ? p. 40 DR . WALLACE Call in the press . This is a perfectly acceptable level of environmental distress . DR . FORENSIC I 'm going to sue . She was a perfect child . Blond , blue-eyed . High I.Q. DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER We need protest marches , boycotts , riots . A good disaster rouses the blood . DR . WALLACE Half a million have died . The plague is spreading . The DOD wants no part of this . We need a high-toned memorial meeting . We need some good public grieving . DR . CHREODE I will make her , again . I swear . Perfect as she was before . DR . FORENSIC Five procedures to flush the eggs out . Five punctures of the vaginal wall . Hundreds of diagnostic tests . Hormones , minerals , vitamins , sonograms , scans , bed rest . DR . CHREODE On my honor , as a man of my word , I will recreate each lost life , from their own genetic material which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to crawl out there . I just have to dodge the lethal bacteria . I knew something would happen someday . We all knew it , did n't we ? That 's why I collected their genes . The genes of the innocent ones . I stored them in a deep freeze . Next to the orange Popsicles . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Nothing like a disaster to bring people together . Now they 'll understand how stupid , lethargic , weak-minded , deluded they have been along . Trusting science to set it right ! Take it from someone who knows the field . It 's idiotic . Absurd . p. 41 DR . WALLACE The DOD ca n't be bothered with this . DR . CHREODE If only I had my legs back . If only I had the use of my head . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Yes , we organized . We resisted . In the camps , underground . We refused . We suffered for our ideals . DR . WALLACE The DOD wants a whitewash . A sex scandal in the White House . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hundreds of thousands of team hours , dollars . What a blessing she was . What a right . DR . CHREODE If I could only think straight . Maybe I could remember how they all were , rushing around . I can put them back just like that . They will regenerate . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Come , come , Edward , screw your head on straight . Get off your behind . There 's work to be done . Disaster is challenge for those who move fast . Seize opportunity when it knocks . You wo n't be their dupe . You 'll know what to do . You 'll use them . They wo n't use you . HAILA falls back into her chair , and wheels herself out . EDWARD wakes abruptly . DREAM ENDS PHILBERT WALLACE enters . DR . WALLACE So , Edward , what do you say ?

DR . CHREODE Plague is possible . DR . WALLACE Possible . Possible . Are you seriously suggesting we halt the progress of the scientific effort because something awful might result ? Pause . They look at one another . EDWARD does n't know how to answer this line of thought. @x The double-doors swing open ; HAILA and THEODORA FORENSIC are in the midst of a serious conversation . HAILA is filled with excitement ; THEODORA is worried , depressed . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER So , memory is not stored within the brain . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Now we go out again , into the unknown . DR . FORENSIC But an entirely new set of experiments needs to be thought through . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Naturally . How thrilling . DR . FORENSIC But I do n't have the slightest idea where to start . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Ask yourself . Where can memory hide do you suppose ? DR . FORENSIC But . . . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER This is science , my dear . Constant ignorance . Constant bliss . . . because what we will discover now will be far more beautiful than what we have disowned . HAILA wheels herself back out the double doors . DR . FORENSIC Bosh . Just when I thought I 'd have more time for my own research . The phone rings . THEODORA is clearly exhausted ; she 's been trying to keep up with HAILA 's changing demands plus pursue her own research at night . Through-out the following phone call , she chews ravenously on a squished candy bar , she finds in her lab coat pocket. p. 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know . I know . I 'm sorry . I know . Still , it does not seem to me that three , even four or five first trimester abortions are too great a price a pay to achieve a perfect baby , if you still want a genetically connected child . silence But you are carrying defective genes . Abort , wait two months . Try again . ( silence ) Yes , I know the Times did report my astonishing success , but that was with mice . PHILBERT WALLACE opens the door a crack , stops to listen to the phone call . DR . FORENSIC The press exaggerates . silence No , it has nothing to do with cost . Look , I do n't have my own lab . It 's even difficult for me to talk . The technology has not been perfected yet . I have no time . silence I 'll phone you in for the abortion . Try again . silence You can always go the surrogacy route . Implant a healthy egg and sperm . There is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain dead fetal nurturer . They 're reporting great success utilizing these neomorts. silence I 'll get you a list of available wombs on life support systems . Think over your options . silence Crying wo n't help . PHILBERT WALLACE enters p. 46 DR . FORENSIC Someone 's just come in , I must get off the line . Make yourself some tea . Read a book . Go shopping . She hangs up the phone , throws her clipboard down on the floor . DR . FORENSIC Women ! She 's set herself up as a broodmare . DR . WALLACE You know how it is , Theodora , for a woman the need to procreate is all . DR . FORENSIC No , Philbert . I do n't know how it is . The need to procreate does n't show itself in me . The need to master gene therapy -- that I feel . If I could get inside this weeping woman , now , with a needle , and stick a good gene on so she could have her perfect child in peace ! That , Philbert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , Theodora . Patience . Perseverance . DR . FORENSIC It 's so damn frustrating , Philbert , to know so much . . . HER glasses off , she stares , nearsightedly , into PHILBERT 's face . They gaze at one another . DR . WALLACE Odds are one among us will figure it out , this year or next . PHILBERT begins to move towards HER ; THEODORA backs away from him , as he moves her around the table . DR . WALLACE Too many of us are right on the verge . Our business is simply to make certain the final breakthrough happens here . In these laboratories . THEY end standing close together in the middle of the room . PHILBERT whispers seductively. p. 47 DR . WALLACE Theodora , you need money , technicians , peace of mind . THEODORA is thrilled . DR . FORENSIC Oh , yes , Philbert , I do . I do . That 's exactly what I need ! HE continues coming towards her , and she backs across the room too the wall . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstatic . HE keeps coming at her , backing her up against the wall . DR . WALLACE Then once we get gene therapy under our belts , we 'll be set . For those who can pay the price , there will be no limits to perfectibility of the race . The human gene pool will be ours to endlessly manipulate . Of course , selective abortion will always be cheaper , easier . He falls on his knees in front of her , his arms pinned to the wall on either side of her . DR . WALLACE Theodora , You possess the perfect genes and so do I. Together we can make a dynasty . Will you marry me ? SHE leaps in fright . DR . FORENSIC Philbert , please get up . I ca n't marry yet . I have n't proven myself . SHE gets away from him . HE follows her , until during this speech he has backed her into the table . SHE leans back on the table and he comes down on top of her , as if to kiss her. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own laboratory . You 'll be in complete control of your life . Face it , Theodora , human gene alteration therapy is for those with flaws . But among the intellectual elite , genetic perfection already exists . We can become the models for everyone else . Just before his lips reach hers , PHILBERT pulls away . HE goes upstage to the blackboard to illustrate his plan . THEODORA sits , stunned , listening to him . DR . WALLACE Here 's my plan . We scrape a mere ten eggs per month off of your uterus , after multiple ovulation has been induced with injected drugs . We can fertilize those ten eggs in vitro with my sperm , collected fresh , or if I am feeling overworked , from the frozen stock already deposited in the Nobel sperm bank . Each zygote would be cultured to the blastocyst stage in vitro , and screened for any unforeseen mutation before being implanted into a surrogate class of women , created from our immigrant or homeless populations , or , as you just said , from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would keep on making your genetic contributions to succeeding generations . Practiced monthly for 25 years , the strategy I 've just outlined would produce 2,910 off-spring . I know that is n't much . But coupled with the efforts of an internationally select group of gene donors equal in stature to ourselves , a small , but powerful genetically elite intelligentsia could be created in our lifetime . Think of how humanity would benefit . PHILBERT comes back to her , kneeling again in front of her. p. 49 DR . WALLACE Theodora , be my wife . I adore you . I want to enter the gene pool with you . HAILA wheels herself in , recklessly DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Philbert , get up from that ridiculous position . I need to speak with my assistant . DR . WALLACE I want you for eternity . I 'll set you up in your own laboratory . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Cut the crap , Philbert . You want to use her brains to speed your own research . But she 's my post doc . DR . WALLACE She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Dante felt for Beatrice . It 's not her brains I want . She can keep them for herself . I promise her intellectual freedom and respect . By the way , Haila , I need your memory work . The market research boys are getting antsy . DR . FORENSIC looking at the paper Haila has handed her But , Haila , these experiments will keep us busy for years ! DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Then we 'd better get started , had n't we ? DR . WALLACE Theodora , a lab of your own . He exits DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Philbert , you 're a thief . p. 50 DR . FORENSIC He 's asked me to marry him and give him all my eggs . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER And set you up in your own lab . DR . FORENSIC Yes . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Are you ready for your own lab ? That 's the real question . Not whether you love him , which you do n't . DR . FORENSIC Of course , I do n't love him . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FORENSIC Yes . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER You can always take a lover in your spare time . DR . FORENSIC I do n't have spare time . I need three years of funding and peace of mind . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER And , so , you would abandon me at this crucial moment ? DR . FORENSIC But , Haila , I have to solve gene alteration techniques . . . your memory work is . . . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Ca n't those famous fathers of yours set you up in a funded lab ? DR . FORENSIC Their bet was I could make it on my own . p. 51 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Marry Philbert , then . He 'll support your work and he wo n't distract you with his emotional needs . Philbert 's completely blocked . DR . FORENSIC At least he does n't want sex . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER When I was your age , I used to have my lovers in the lab . Make love , take a bath , do an experiment , make love . I 'm the last woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The erotic life does n't interest me . I must get back to work . Can Edward drive you home ? It 's late . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Do n't stay all night . THEODORA falls immediately to sleep at her lab bench . DREAM IMAGE Voices of SCIENTISTS ' on tape . Their large , grotesque shapes are seen through the plexi-glass windows of the large double-door . As THEODORA lies sleeping on the table , her belly grows large . SHE wakes , very pregnant , stands drowsily , rubbing her big belly . VOICE All right , that 's it . Here 's to a job well done . The Caucasian gene pool is officially declared free of defect . VOICE Wait , what 's that bleep on the screen ? VOICE That 's Theodora Forensic . VOICE She got herself pregnant by natural means . p. 52 VOICE She 's joined the herbal underground .

VOICE Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests ? VOICE This is still a free country . VOICE Of course , a technocracy . THEODORA walks dreamily out the double-doors into the arms of the doctors . VOICE At what age can the fetus bring suit ? THEODORA FORENSIC appears at a lab door . She is wheeling a chair on which sits the talking head of EDWARD CHREDOE , her new-born , bodiless child . He is babbling uncontrollably as head rolls , egg-like , on the seat . THEODORA dotes on him , arranging his cap , and the blankets around his neck as he talks . EDWARD CHREODE AS THE TALKING HEAD Just like Sam Beckett , I retain a vivid memory of my mother 's womb . I was carried , I said , with my head outside the universe . The body inside , inside of her , that one there who pushes my chair . But the head floated free in a space unexplored , a space denied , the space beyond space . Outside the universe , my head through a black hole in the firmament , I saw and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space , my head through a medium sized black hole in the universe , that there is a transcendent cause , that some vast intelligence rules and we are the creatures of what this great thinking pulse is . I saw . There I saw . No surprises , no . Nothing new . Nothing to tell . Nothing to tell , because there is no one to hear . No one to listen to me . No hearers . Nothing heard from the head that once floated free from beyond the beyond . And suddenly saw the divine cause , the implicate order , rising in waves , and felt , yes , felt through the tremors in the iris of the eye , free floating the past being present , wave after wave of form giving form . The future attracting the past , pulling the past after it . The future desiring itself , attracting , pulling at form . And I being formed by everyone unusual who had ever lived , a talking head come from beyond , a bearer to earth of forms about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

FORENSIC to the scientists , shadows on the wall I 've brought you my child . As my rightful fathers , I wanted you to see what I 've conceived . She removes the cloth . He beings speaking immediately again DR . CHREODE It 's highly probable that beyond the beyond there is new beginning , if we ask ourselves where did the ability to generate form first arise we have to remember that outside the universe is something else . Something like pure feeling . Yes , I said the word . Kill me . Kill me if you wish . Before I say something worse . Wave after wave of essence of creative capacity flows in the flesh , rises in us from beyond . . . SHE drops the cloth again , he is silent . All the SCIETISTS point at THEODORA screaming . VOICES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective child from the womb . Now society suffers from gibberish . Guilty . Guilty . Sterilize her . Tie her down . Life unworthy of life can not be allowed . As the shadows rush towards THEODORA , she manages to unveil the head once more . PHILBERT WALLACE rushes out , dressed in surgical attire , rubber gloves . He drags THEODORA FORENSIC out to be sterilized . As she is violated , EDWARD CHREODE , immobile in the chair , keeps talking ) p. 54 DR . CHREODE There is sense to the universe , a thinking mind of creation , an incessant becoming , which we are bidden to know , out of which all form arises , rearranges , returning , resurfacing , there is meaning and most of all there is feeling . This knowledge , my friends , of oneness , and unity , of all things connected , this knowledge of infinite grace , organic compassion , ceaseless becoming , purpose , unfolding meaning is the end result toward which science struggles . . . A totally masked and gowned figure appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheels him out the double-doors . VOICE Look at what we 've done to Theodora Forensic . VOICE We could unblock her tubes . VOICE Let 's make her new ones . From plastic . VOICE Plastic , of course . Plastic is wonderful . VOICE Let 's rebuild Theodora Forensic . VOICE She must know the joys of motherhood . VOICE Yes , operate . VOICE What about him ? VOICE Forget him . Put him away . Lock him up . VOICE Cut off his head . VOICE Cut off his head ? Ha , ha , ha gales of laughter and THEODORA wakes up . DREAM ENDS. ) @x THEODORA FORENSIC enters EDWARD CHREODE 's lab . DR . FORENSIC Edward Chreode , Philbert asked me to share these results . DR . CHREODE Just a minute , Theodora , stay where you are . I have to clear something away . Rendezvous . DR . FORENSIC Oh , let me in , Edward . What have you got to hide ? DR . CHREODE Nothing , rendezvous , nothing at all . DR . FORENSIC Everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHREODE Do n't touch that . Do n't sit over there . Rendezvous . DR . FORENSIC Why do you keep saying that word ? DR . CHREODE All right , Theodora . Sit down . I do have something that should interest you . He turns on a projector . Various slides of the DNA are projected on the wall . DR . FORENSIC Edward , how absolutely beautiful it is . I 'm always struck by the beauty of the genes . When I see someone small-minded or mean , I ca n't help but think , " but inside you are as beautiful as the Grand Canyon , or a tropical island , if you only knew . " p. 57 DR . CHREODE It 's the cancer gene spliced next to the gene for cardiovascular failure . DR . FORENSIC There does seem to be a distinct predilection to be weak one way or the other . DR . CHREODE " Rendezvous . " Because of my work a pre-natal test is about to be marketed which will determine the likelihood of each unborn succumbing at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the probable date of death from either illness . Then parents can decide , if the fetus shows a marked predilection for , say , childhood leukemia , or heart attack during peak earning years , whether or not they wish to terminate the pregnancy . And try again . Funny , how I 've been led quite naturally from ideas about imminent extinction , rendezvous , to this work on diseaseless perfection . Life-insurance companies are already suing to gain access to longevity information , so are the best colleges who do n't see any reason to educate anyone but the fittest . I 'm suddenly so busy with a whole range of experiments , and with all the graduate students I have to supervise , rendezvous , I have no time to spend hours , as I used to , dreaming or speculating . But , then again , the days of creating science from dreams are gone . Now that the basic laws of nature are known , it 's become a matter of filling in details , fitting together the pieces , developing technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great time to be a biologist. p. 58 DR . FORENSIC By the way , Edward , congratulations on your promotion . DR . CHREODE Thank you , rendezvous . Congratulations on your new laboratory and on your marriage . DR . FORENSIC Why do you keep saying that word ? DR . CHREODE Is n't it strange . It began in my sleep last night . I sat up straight and woke mother with a shout . " Rendezvous " she told me at breakfast I screamed . Frankly , I ca n't even seem to tell when I say the word . " Rendezvous . " DR . FORENSIC " Rendezvous " It 's a meeting . Do you have an important meeting ? But it also means surrender . " I surrender to you . " " I put myself in your hands . " I give over to you . " It 's strange . DR . CHREODE It 's a small involuntary act , like a hiccough , perhaps . DR . FORENSIC But with meaning ? Does n't it make you stop to consider what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't remember my dreams . DR . FORENSIC Oh , I never have . Certainly not since graduate school . DR . CHREODE We 're wasting time . DR . FORENSIC Yes , let 's go on . p. 59 DR . CHREODE There 's something quite tricky , we 've begun to think about here in this laboratory . I tell you as a trusted colleague . Do n't breath a word . Could n't we not somehow shoot these genes into people who are not carrying them at all . Advancing armies , perhaps , suddenly decimated by fast growing cancers or heart attacks ? " Rendezvous " The , if we could do away with these two major killers , our side would be left , basically , invulnerable . A defensive weapon with this potential might end the last possible threat of nuclear war and actually lead to disarmament . So that the field of molecular biology might actually right the great shame of physics . Then , we , on our side , would be left with the problems of aging . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as long as the body functions ? Then , perhaps , in cases of exceptional achievement , we could keep certain outstanding individuals alive for several hundred years or more . That sort of thing . Think how society would benefit . " Rendezvous ? " DR . FORENSIC The only cells known to have the capacity for endless division are those which are malignant . It seems clear , we have to steal the secret of immortality from the cancerous cells and give it to the healthy cells which , at present , all die in good time . DR . CHREODE Rendezvous , rendezvous , rendezvous ! DR . FORENSIC Edward , are you in control of what you are saying ? p. 60 DR . CHREODE Absolutely , rendezvous . Between us we seem to be sitting on most far-reaching basic research discoveries in the realm of rendezvous . I do wish I could stop saying that rendezvous . EDWARD CHREODE is increasingly possessed by the word " rendezvous " , his body is contorted with the effort of saying , or not saying the word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in your usage ? A minute ago , you were saying Rendezvous as a sort of exclamation , but just now you 've begun to use it within sentences itself , as if it had distinct meanings . DR . CHREODE Rendezvous to you , Theodora Forensic . Rendezvous . What can you possibly rendezvous of rendezvous ? DR . FORENSIC Edward , do you suppose you should see a neurologist ? Dr. Leaderman down the hall is the best in his field . The usually mild mannered EDWARD CHREODE chases THEODORA FORENSIC out of his lab . DR . CHREODE That son of a rendezvous . Rendezvous is a butcher . I 'll be rendezvous momentarily . Do n't rendezvous a word of this to anyone , especially not to my own rendezvous , or your rendezvous , himself . It would drive them both rendezvous . Theodora , rendezvous out of here . Do what I rendezvous of you ! Alone , he tried desperately to steady himself. p. 61 DR . CHREODE Now , I must get a grip on my rendezvous . Now a rather whimsical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is black and brown and short haired with a hump on its back and the hump is covered with long , shaggy , , darker hair . It has horns and large , round , expressive dark eyes . The BEAST walks right up to EDWARD CHREODE . Looks him straight in the eyes and clearly and distinctly says : BEAST Rendezvous . EDWARD CHREODE faints The BEAST begins to lick EDWARD CHREODE , with a sloppy wet tongue , and to nuzzle him awake . EDWARD CHREODE sits . The BEAST , who has the sweetest of all imaginable voices , says : ) BEAST Rendezvous . Rendezvous . DR . CHREODE Rendezvous . BEAST Rendezvous . Rendezvous . DR . CHREODE Rendezvous . The BEAST nudges EDWARD CHREODE up on his feet . BEAST Rendezvous , rendezvous . EDWARD CHREODE understands the invitation to dance . EDWARD CHREODE and the BEAST begin to dance to the beat of rendezvous . They make music with the word and with little bells , and they dance to the beat of the rendezvous song . When the dance is done , EDWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHREODE 's shoulders . They speak to one another , pleading eternal fidelity , using the one word of their common language. ) p. 62 BEAST ( Now , I must go . Do n't forget me . ) Rendezvous . Rendezvous . Rendezvous . DR . CHREODE ( Do n't leave me . Do n't go . ) Rendezvous , rendezvous , rendezvous . BEAST ( I must go . Do n't forget me ) Rendezvous . Rendezvous . Rendezvous . DR . CHREODE ( I will never forget you ) Rendezvous . The BEAST goes out the door , nearly running into HAILA in her wheel chair , who does not notice . The BEAST steps aside , letting her enter , and throws one long look at EDWARD CHREODE before vanishing . EDWARD , visibly unsettled , nevertheless , attempts to appear calm before his mother . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Edward , you 've frightened that poor girl half to death . I want you to speak to me now without once using that word . DR . CHREODE Certainly , mother . No cause for excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUDENSCHMARTZER Bad dreams have no place in a lab . DR . CHREODE Mother , I 'm fully recovered . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Very good , Edward . We 'll forget this unfortunate lapse ever happened . As you continue to advance , Edward , you 'll learn that forgetfulness is a great virtue . It 's impossible to live a productive life without forgetting a good deal of what happens to oneself . Now , duty calls us both . p. 63 DR . CHREODE Of course , mother , back to work . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Yes , yes . My research has taken a particularly difficult turn . I 'm all alone , without a close colleague , partner or husband . No , I 've never had a true companion in work . Never an equal to comfort or inspire or pay the bills . And memory , Edward , this fact of being able to recall what is past , has plagued me all my life . Why should n't the past simply cease to exist ? It could , if the evolutionary information were contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , does the flesh need to hold on ? HAILA wheels herself out . The BEAST sticks her head around the door . BEAST Rendezvous . EDWARD CHREODE , his head turned away from the BEAST , shakes his entire body in an attitude of despair and dismay at what has happened/is happening to him . INTERMISSION @x Absolutely deafening applause Triumphal music , celebratory lights . THEODORA wheels HAILA backwards in front of the stage . HAILA throws confetti at PHILBERT WALLACE who is carried in on the shoulders of EDWARD CHREODE and another scientist in white lab coat . PHILBERT is deposited on stage at the podium . This is PHILBERT 'S DREAM . HE begins to speak . ) DR . WALLACE Today , I 'm thrilled to announce to the entire human race that we have completely mastered gene alteration techniques . There are no defects we can not correct . DR . FORENSIC He 's brilliant . Absolutely brilliant . What a mind . How glad I am to join my genes with his . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER I 'm prouder of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider him my real son . DR . CHREODE What a man ! The best around . I am honored to assist in his great plans . DR . WALLACE Suffering has been abolished by us , the genetic scientists . No loss , no pain , no doubt , no handicaps , mental or emotional , come between the individual and his or her full potential . Everyone is optimized at genius level . Thunderous applause p. 65 DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER At last , we are freed from destiny and fate . Freed from the past . DR . WALLACE Of course , we must now leave the earth which threatens us still with disease and with death . The entire galaxy beckons us , offering unparalleled potential for economic development and human betterment . Thunderous applause . PHILBERT holds his hands for silence . ) Ladies and gentlemen , I have a special surprise guest for you this afternoon . May I have your attention and a very warm welcome for our very own Mother Earth . In PHILBERT 's dream , HAILA is MOTHER EARTH . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is decorated to look like a rather frowsy suburban matron 's hat . She speaks in a halting , low , apologetic , passive , mother 's voice . DR . GUDENSCHMARTZER Thank you , Philbert . Thank you very much . Well , I thought . . . I 'm not really used to public speaking . I hardly ever say anything at all . But I thought , well , as you are all about to depart , well , I could n't really let you go without offering some few words of advice . You know how mothers are . We always do want the best for our children and we try , well , we do try , in our own imperfect ways , to do the right thing , we worry , you know , those of you who are mothers will understand what I mean . Are there any mothers left out there ? Oh , yes , yes , I see a few hands , one or two . Yes , well then , you will understand . You will understand what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to admit the mistakes you 've made with your children . To really look hard at your own failings and at all the ways your own limitations have warped your off-spring . Yes , well all we mothers can do is try . We all do try just as hard as we can . Now , of course , that you 've perfected birth , you 've forgotten all of that . No one woman is responsible . Perhaps , I should have thought it out like that . Maybe it 's the best way , after all . In any case I wish you luck . And I do just want to take a moment of your time to leave you all with a few parting words . Some little saying to carry away , some words to live by on your outer-spacial journey . Well , I 'm not going to tell you how much I 'm going to miss you . I will miss you . That might seem strange to you , after all the troubles we 've had , but I will miss you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss me one little bit , but I have always had your best interests at heart . I have tried and I have given a lot . I 've done my best . And if that best was n't good enough , well , now , I promised myself I would n't go on like this . I really just came here because I do simply want to leave you all with a word or two that might somehow be helpful . I 'll try not to bore you with much , but I did want to say , well , in all these years that you 've been here with me , and in the all the years before you came , and maybe , too , in all the years to come once you leave me alone to clean up your mess I 've only had one thought , really , one thought only has guided me . Odd , how hard it is to put it into words . I suppose I had hoped you would see it for yourselves . Well , all right , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of mine I always have had . It goes a little bit like this : No matter what ever happened , no matter how many mistakes I made , no matter what ever was done to me , from the first time they cut me to mine oil and coal , to the time they dropped the atom bomb , to more recent years when they took from me the secrets of the genes , and started putting human growth hormones into pigs so the poor little things could n't stand up , and were depressed all the time , I 've always thought only one thing , and it 's been this : whatever happens to you , mother , you just keep on doing what you 've always done , you just keep on answering everything with life , you just keep putting forth life , you just keep making the green earth sprout . And in the cities , you know , I had the plants grow right up through the sidewalks . And even in the barren deserts and the jungles I made so many diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moths alone , well , I thought that would give you pause . I really thought you would understand . Well , that 's all , I wanted to say . I just wanted to remind you and ask you to remember that as you go on your way . It was n't enough , I understand . It was n't enough to make you happy in the end . Maybe in space where there are n't any other forms of life you will be more comfortable and you 'll be able to look after yourselves better out there than you have done here , where you had so many brothers and sisters and the competition seemed to overwhelm you . So I wish the very best to each and every human being . Thank you for taking the time to listen to me . Thank you , Philbert . Thank you all . silence. p. 66 DR . WALLACE Thank you , mother . How about a round of applause . DREAM ENDS THEODROA enters , holding print-out material . DR . FORENSIC Philbert , I must speak with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scans them hastily Theodora , I find these results unsatisfactory . DR . FORENSIC So do I , of course , that 's why I 'm here . DR . WALLACE These results are inconclusive . We need the answer . We need a fool-proof method for gene alteration . We need it now . DR . FORENSIC But it is n't going to work . SHE storms out , HE follows her through the hall to her office . DR . WALLACE Of course , it will work . DR . FORENSIC Look , Philbert , we 've already proven conclusively that the attachment of new genetic material has completely unpredictable effects . The organism becomes confused . It seems to me that DNA has been vastly overrated . DR . WALLACE Theodora , do you want a divorce ? DR . FORENSIC Yes . p. 67 DR . WALLACE Traitor . DR . FORENSIC I ca n't make gene alteration work . DR . WALLACE You were my brightest hope , Theodora , the brilliant star on the horizon . You 've failed me , Theodora . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FORENSIC Philbert , something we have n't dreamed of yet is happening . DR . WALLACE Legally , I 'm entitled to joint custody of your eggs and if you do n't behave admirably , I 'll sue you for full custody in perpetuity . DR . FORENSIC I 'm telling you I have to abandon all my research . What do you think I am a prize winning hen ? DR . WALLACE Team work , Theodora , team work . Your eggs and my sperm . DR . FORENSIC I do n't need to reproduce , Philbert . I need to work . DR . WALLACE My parents did n't care what I achieved , Theodora . They had no aspirations for their son . My father was a mechanic ; my mother cooked lunches at the high school . As a child , I used to dream that these people were just my surrogate caregivers , and that my real parents , my gene donors , were out in the real , world , brilliantly successful , rich . Maybe I was right . Legally , Theodora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FORENSIC Take my eggs , Philbert , if you want them so much . DR . WALLACE You really are totally without maternal feeling . DR . FORENSIC I suppose I can stand one thoroughly invasive medical procedure . The pain might be a relief from the unbearable agony of this failed research . DR . WALLACE For a real woman , the pain is bearable . We simply drill a small hole through the uterine wall . DR . FORENSIC I know the procedure , Philbert . DR . WALLACE Give me your eggs , Theodora , I 'll forget I ever wanted you to share my life . DR . FORENSIC Maybe I 'm not as brilliant as you had hoped , Philbert ? Did you ever consider that ? Maybe my eggs are n't worth much . Maybe I 'm a fraud . DR . WALLACE Nonsense . I 'll take care of your eggs , Theodora . I 'll see to the details of their fertilization and their implantation . I 'll follow through on their maturation . I 'll send them to all the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my lab . DR . FORENSIC I tell you , I 'm stuck . I do n't know which way to turn . DR . WALLACE How many short sighted people said the atom could n't be split . Genes can be altered . They will be . We will do it . Here , in these labs . All of us . Together . Like a family , Theodora . We must . Theodora , I want you standing next to me the day we conquer DNA . We can reconsider our divorce , Theodora , it was never just for your eggs . . . I had hoped . . . p. 69 DR . FORENSIC No , Philbert , no . These personal things mean nothing to me . You 're right , of course , I ca n't start questioning the very premises of all of our work just because I 'm momentarily frustrated . DR . WALLACE Think ! Theodora , think ! DR . FORENSIC Maybe , if I can devise a simple alteration in the experimental technique , perhaps , if I change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I begin to see a way to proceed . Let me take another look at those results . DR . WALLACE That 's the spirit , Theodora . I 'll schedule you in for complete egg removal . DR . FORENSIC ( Thoroughly preoccupied ) Right , Philbert , right . Just make certain they do n't want to keep me overnight . I ca n't take that much time off . SHE takes the papers and leaves.
