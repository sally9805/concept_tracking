<p> D-Day is two months away , but Billy Graham 's evangelical army stands ready for the Battle of the Bay . <p> Eight thousand volunteer soldiers recruited from more than a thousand local churches have already been trained to win souls in the fields of the Lord  --  the Cow Palace , the Oakland Coliseum and the San Jose Arena . <p> From his command center above downtown San Jose , field marshall Scott Lenning walks among computer screens flashing Biblical messages to inspire the troops . <p> " For the wages of sin is death , " one screen saver warns , " but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord . " <p> Lenning , resident crusade director for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association , has done this before . <p> In fact , he 's done it 13 times in the last 14 years , moving his family to a new city nearly a year before Graham issues his first altar call . <p> Like many involved in the Graham organization , Lenning has revival in his blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Hour of Decision , " for 37 years . <p> " This crusade involves three diverse communities , " said Lenning . " Any one of them would be a challenge to prepare . " <p> Since founding his evangelical empire in 1950 , Graham , now 78 years old and suffering from Parkinson 's disease , has held hundreds of crusades before millions of Christians and potential converts all over the world . <p> Like all his crusades , five of the Bay Area revival sessions will be taped for national television broadcast two months after Graham leaves town . <p> His failing health has given an air of urgency to each upcoming crusade . But his legendary organization hums along like a finely tuned machine . <p> This fall 's Bay Area crusades will be held September 26-28 in San Jose , October 9-11 in San Francisco and October 25-26 in Oakland . But the inspiration for the event dates back to 1985 and a Billy Graham crusade at Angels Stadium in Orange County . <p> " Mr. Graham had finished the Anaheim crusade and flew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " Lenning said . " But he had a burden on his heart , and thought about how long it had been since he 'd preached in San Francisco . " <p> Graham had not held a San Francisco crusade since the spring of 1958 , when nearly 700,000 people saw him during a seven-week revival at the Cow Palace . <p> Ten years after the Anaheim crusade , during a 1995 rally in Sacramento , three South Bay pastors invited Graham to come to San Jose . <p> Graham , who had preached in San Jose in 1981 , asked the South Bay delegation to see if there was interest in having him return to San Francisco and Oakland , where Graham last appeared in 1971 . <p> There was . Once word got out that Graham was interested in a three-city Bay Area crusade , his Minneapolis-based association received hundreds of letters asking him to come . <p> Following consultations with local clergy and stadium operators , the Bay Area crusade was announced at a rally in San Jose last October . <p> Lenning soon arrived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite offices in Oakland and San Francisco . <p> Local churches are key players in Billy Graham crusades , providing volunteer power and follow-up counseling for the thousands of " inquirers " who come forward to be " born again , " to dedicate their lives to Jesus Christ . <p> Invitations to participate were sent to 5,000 Bay Area churches . <p> In January , 1,056 clergy and lay leaders from 433 churches responded by attending 18 crusade information seminars around the Bay . More meetings were held , and by the beginning of the summer , 724 churches were participating in the crusade . <p> Last month , nearly 20,000 Bay Area Christians attended training courses held at 33 churches stretching from Mill Valley to Gilroy . The classes are specially designed to prepare the volunteers to work as counselors for those who answer Graham 's altar call . <p> Eight thousand volunteers completed the course , and signed up to work as counselors . <p> At one recent session at the San Francisco Christian Center , around 400 volunteers listened as Art Bailey , the director of counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of what they 'll face when potential converts stream onto the floor of the Cow Palace or the playing field of the Coliseum . <p> Bailey preaches with the evangelical zeal and folksy charm of the Graham team , pacing back and forth before the class , punctuating his lesson with down-home jokes and personal vignettes . <p> " People will come up to you at the crusade and tell you they are going through terrible times , " Bailey told the class . " You can help them diagnose the problem . " <p> Volunteer counselors in the Christian Life and Witness Course are given instruction booklets full of advice on how to handle potential converts . <p> " Win the confidence of people by being interested in them , " the booklet advises . " Let them tell you their concerns . Ask them what is their greatest need . Just being a good listener will open many doors . " <p> Other tips for counselors range from explaining why God lets innocents suffer to making sure they come equipped with " something to sweeten the breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco Christian Center , a Pentecostal church in the Mission District , was impressed with the course . <p> " It takes away the fear of being a counselor , " Manion said . " It helps you look at your own Christian life , how to face problems , and how to witness to other people . " <p> Another leading member of the San Francisco Christian Center , Johnny Stein , has been hired by the Graham organization as the fulltime coordinator for the Cow Palace crusade . <p> Stein , the former general manager of the San Francisco Municipal Railway , is using some of his transit expertise to organize shuttle bus service to the aged auditorium . <p> He 's also making phone calls to the San Francisco churches that have not responded to the invitation to participate in the crusade . <p> " There are 522 churches in San Francisco , and we only have about 20 percent of them participating , " Stein said . " They usually get about a third of them involved in a crusade . We 're just making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just a matter of the pastors being too busy to participate . " <p> Church interest on the Peninsula , and in the South Bay and East Bay , is much higher , with around 40 percent of local churches participating . <p> Not surprisingly , conservative evangelical churches  --  such as Baptist , Assembly of God , and other independent fundamentalist , evangelical and Pentecostal congregations  --  are best represented among the 1,098 churches participating . <p> At the same time , dozens of mainline Protestant churches  --  and a growing number of Roman Catholic parishes  --  are signing on . <p> All three Bay Area Roman Catholic bishops have given their blessing , allowing parish priests to participate if they wish . <p> Joining the crusade takes time , but it 's also a way for congregations to attract new members . Those who answer Graham 's altar call are referred to local churches in their neighborhoods . <p> " Many Catholics go to these crusades , and a lot of them are Catholics who 've had problems with the church , " said the Rev. Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . " It can be a way for them to have their faith renewed and restored . " <p> O'Rourke said the Graham organization " will meticulously send them back to the ( Catholic ) church if they declare they are Catholic . " <p> " It can be substantial numbers , " he said . " In San Antonio about 6,000 Catholics filled out cards , and their names were sent back to the archdiocese . " <p> Stein said many churches signing up for the crusade are putting denominational and political differences aside . <p> " Catholics and Protestants are coming together , " said Stein . " Mr. Graham is the only person in the country who could bring together this diverse cross section . " <p> Stein said he would have loved to have seen that kind of cooperation during his 33 years as a bus driver and transit manager for the City of San Francisco . <p> " Billy Graham has this work down to a science , " said Stein . " Everyone has the same goal in mind . It 's like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO FAITH <p> A CONVERT REMEMBERS GRAHAM 'S LAST SAN FRANCISCO REVIVAL , 39 YEARS AGO <p> It was the worst earthquake since the Great One of 1906  --  more than enough to inspire Cecille Burton to " find Christ at the Cow Palace . " <p> In the spring of 1958 , one month after a 5.5-magnitude earthquake rocked San Francisco , a 38- year-old evangelist named Billy Graham began a seven-week crusade at the Cow <p> " We 'd just had the earthquake , and I was scared , " recalled Burton , now 69 , retired and living in Richmond . " I thought I might be eternally doomed . " <p> At the time , Burton was married , living in San Francisco and working for the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union . <p> Although raised in a church-going family , Burton said she " was n't a Christian at all " back in 1958 . But she managed to persuade her husband to go with her to see Billy Graham . <p> " I thought I was just going because I liked him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when he gave the altar call , I thought , ' Well , this might be my last chance . ' <p> " We were sitting in the balcony at the Cow Palace . I asked my husband if he 'd go down with me and he said , ' No . I 'm not going down there . ' I went down and Billy gave a prayer , and then they took us all into another room . A lady with gray hair spoke to us , and asked us if we wanted to accept the Lord . She told us to go out and find ourselves a church . " <p> Burton joined the Emmanuel Christian Church on Post Street , later switching to the San Francisco Christian Center on Mission Street , where she 's still a member . <p> Like Billy Graham , Burton now suffers from Parkinson 's disease , which has prevented her from becoming more involved in the upcoming Bay Area Graham crusade . <p> " Mr. Graham put me on the right path , " she said .
