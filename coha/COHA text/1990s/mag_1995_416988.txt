YES , WE KNOW , THE HOLIDAYS ARE HERE , and you may have serious shopping to do . But put down that credit card for a minute , and take this pop quiz : Which best describes your savings habits ? a . You stash away more than 10% of your income every year . b . You save only if there 's money left over at the end of the month . c . What savings ? If you answered c , you know this article is for you . But if you answered a or b , you 'd better keep reading too . Most Americans are simply not saving enough to reach their financial goals  --  and you may be one of them . Over the past decade , the nation 's personal savings rate has plunged ; recently it has hovered near 3.6% of pretax income , compared with an average of 6.8% in the 1970s . What 's more , a new nationwide MONEY telephone survey of nearly 1,000 adults conducted by ICR Survey Research Group of Media , Pa. ( margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that an alarming one out of five Americans says they 're not saving any money at all . Our poll also shows that the typical American household has net financial assets of only $13,000 excluding home equity . Older , upper-income families have saved far more , however . ( To find out how your savings stack up against others in your age and income group , see the chart on page 123 . ) ( Chart omitted ) The savings shortfall is giving people the willies . Nearly half of those polled worry that they are n't saving enough money . Economists are increasingly concerned too . Warns Stanford economist Douglas Bernheim : " Most baby boomers need to triple the amount they are saving now in order to retire comfortably . " For the typical American , that means saving at least 12% of your paycheck before taxes . Sound impossible ? It is n't . In fact , on the following pages , you 'll read about three supersaver families who are stashing away an impressive 15% or more of pretax income  --  and are still living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 , and his wife Sharon , 45 , of Golden , Colo. ( shown below ) are setting aside an awesome one-third of their combined $78,000 salaries for early retirement yet still own a five-bedroom house with a mountain view . ( Photo omitted ) Declares Roy , an eighth-grade computer teacher : " It 's easier to enjoy yourself when you feel financially secure . " Unfortunately , Uncle Sam has been doing less and less to help you save  --  though that may soon change . In 1986 , for instance , Congress took away the $2,000 write-off for Individual Retirement Account contributions available to every working American , restricting the full deduction to people who are not active participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans and plan participants earning less than $25,000 ( $44,000 for married couples ) . But a Senate Republican plan would , by the year 2007 , extend the IRA write-off to singles making as much as $85,000 and couples with incomes of up to $100,000 ; nonworking spouses could get IRA deductions too . Anyone could also open a nondeductible IRA whose earnings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tax upon withdrawal ) . What 's more , House and Senate Republicans back tax-free IRA withdrawals to pay for major expenses such as college tuition and medical bills . But as MONEY went to press , the tax bill was stuck in budget gridlock . Moreover , any savings benefit you might receive from Congress is likely to be offset by future reductions in Medicare and Social Security . Apparently the savings incentive that most people want , according to our poll , is a slap on the wrist for overspending . A striking 56% of the people MONEY surveyed said they would start saving more if the government created a national sales tax on goods and services . This kind of tax is unlikely to occur anytime soon , however , say Congress watchers . But you need n't and should n't wait for Congress or President Clinton to come to your rescue . There 's plenty you can do alone to boost your savings  --  and your savings returns  --  to reach your goals of a cushy retirement , a college education for your kids , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you do n't have to adopt a Tightwad Gazette lifestyle to do it either . In the following story , we 'll show you six ways that together will help you save a world-class 15% of your income , and we 'll point you to no fewer than 10 great mutual funds for your short- , medium- and long-term savings goals . So relax and keep reading . How to save more 1 . Choose your goals , and then put yourself on a savings diet  --  but leave room for few bonbons . Your first move to bolster your savings should be honing your financial goals . Once you 've set your priorities , calculate how much you must save monthly to achieve each  --  whether your aim is buying a minivan in 1996 or retiring in 15 years . For complex retirement calculations or college planning , consider hiring a financial planner . Or you can do it yourself using software programs such as Quicken Financial Planner ( $39.95 ; 800-816-8025 ) or ones sold by T. Rowe Price ( $15 ; 800-541-4041 ) or Vanguard ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to think about what you really want the most , and to set up a budget for getting it says Peg Downey , a certified financial planner in Silver Spring , Md . But be realistic about the amount of money you plan to set aside  --  and allow yourself a few indulgences . If you launch a crash savings diet , odds are you 'll feel deprived , give up , and head for the mall . To stay motivated , just remember that saving does not mean depriving yourself endlessly . At some point , you will get to spend the money you put away . And the more you save , the bigger the eventual rewards . For those who have trouble staying committed to a financial plan , Carol Keeffe , author of How to Get What You Want in Life ( Little Brown , $10.95 ) , suggests starting with a short-term savings objective , such as a vacation or a CD player . " That will give you a tangible goal to shoot for , not just a boring number like putting away 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 've tasted one savings success , it will be easier to save for longer-term goals . " 2 . Sock away your invisible income . Close in faster on your financial goals by putting away any additional money that comes your way . If you get a raise , for instance , discipline yourself to save the extra amount each month rather than just increasing your expenditures . Also , try to squirrel away any bonuses or cash gifts you receive . Look too for " hidden " income that can be saved instead of unwittingly spent . If you get paid every two weeks , there will be two months each year when you 'll get three paychecks instead of two . Try diverting all or part of that " extra " money into savings . Another tip for those earning more than $62,700 annually : Since your withholding for the 5.2% Social Security payroll tax will stop before the end of the year , save the portion of your salary that you had to give to Uncle Sam in the previous months . Consider it your personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , you can probably put away an additional $1,000 or so just by banking this cash . Similarly , if you finish paying off a debt  --  a student loan or credit-card balance , for example  --  start plowing into savings the money you used to give your creditors . Another smart strategy : If you usually get a tax refund , head to your payroll department and ask for a W-4 form so you can reduce your withholding allowance for 1996 . That way , you  --  not Uncle Sam  --  will earn interest on your money . 3 . Do n't pay your bills until you pay yourself . You 've heard it before , but the advice bears repeating : Never wait till the end of month to search for money to save . After you pay all the bills and take the family out to dinner a few times , there may not be any spare cash . A foolproof method for avoiding that problem is to set up an automatic investing plan , which authorizes your bank to transfer a fixed amount every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutual fund of your choice . You can often painlessly save as little as $50 to $100 a month this way . This pay-yourself-first strategy has worked spectacularly well for Theron Goynes , 66 , and his wife Naomi , 61 , of North Las Vegas , pictured on page 125 . ( Photo omitted ) For the past 25 years , the couple have had regular amounts automatically taken out from their paychecks each month and invested in a retirement annuity . The current size of that portfolio : $200,000 . " If you do n't see it , you do n't miss it . " Theron says . 4 . Shield your savings from the tax man , and watch your returns swell . You can really power up your savings by taking full advantage of your opportunities to save in tax-deferred accounts . If your employer offers a tax-deferred defined-contribution savings plan , such as a 401(k) or 403(b) , you 're in luck . Contribute as much as you can . For one thing , every dollar you put into your plan reduces your taxable income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax break . You also defer taxes on your account 's earnings until you withdraw the cash , so your investments grow faster . Say you earn $80,000 and invest 6% of your salary each year in a balanced fund that returns 8% annually . If you pay taxes on that money at a 28% rate , you 'll have $172,082 in 20 years . But if you invest the same amount in a tax-deferred retirement plan , you 'll end up with $219,657 before taxes . Even if you withdraw all the money at once and then pay the taxes , you 'll still be ahead . And if your employer offers you a matching contribution , as roughly 95% of major firms with 401(k) plans do , that 's free money you ca n't afford to pass up . Do n't overlook the humble IRA , which can still help you save , even if you do n't qualify to deduct your full contribution . Craig Smith , a 32-year-old transmission repair shop owner in Dix Hills , N.Y. , and his wife Pamela , 31 , who sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been shoveling $2,000 a year into their IRAs for over seven years . ( Photo omitted ) Today their IRA accounts have grown to nearly $70,000 . Says Craig : " Contributing to an IRA is the best thing anyone can do for his or her future . " 5 . Make a few small sacrifices to save big bucks . Examine your expenditures carefully , and you 're likely to find some you could easily trim . If , like most people , you 're clueless about where your money is really going , keep track of your spending for a month or two . You may be startled to see how your cash is frittered away  --  $100 a month on Domino 's deliveries , for example . Once you have a clear picture of your spending habits , start looking for ways to cut back . Look first at your most flexible expenses such as entertainment , dining out and travel , suggests Marilyn Capelli , a certified financial planner in Bloomfield , Mich . Taking a vacation close to home next year rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And consider brown-bagging your lunch one or two days a week , instead of spending $7 a day at the local deli . Over a year , that move alone might save you $750  --  and maybe a few pounds too . 6 . Shop till your expenses drop . Careful spending can provide a big payoff . We 're not talking about buying mayonnaise in 55-gallon drums at the Price Club , either . You can save thousands of dollars and then saw those thousands by plugging the biggest drains on your wallet , such as your mortgage payment and insurance coverage . If the interest rate on your mortgage is higher than today 's rates  --  7.8% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan , say  --  you ought to consider refinancing , says Peter Miller , author of the Common-Sense Mortgage ( HarperPerennial , $13 ) . If you swap a 9.95 , 30-year , $100,000 mortgage for one at 7.8% , you 'll reduce your monthly payments by $154 . True , refinancing costs will dent your savings initially , unless you can opt for a higher-interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll save as much as $55,400 . Better yet , if you refinance your $100,000 mortgage but keep up your old monthly payments  --  thereby prepaying your mortgage  --  you 'll save a whopping $130,900 in interest costs over the life of the loan . You can also free up a considerable amount of cash by shopping for a cheaper life insurance policy , points out Steve Ames , a certified financial planner in Annapolis , Md . If you 're currently paying for a costly whole life policy , for example , consider switching to a low-load term policy . That will save you hundreds of dollars in annual premium payments as well as dramatically reduce commission costs . To get a free comparison of low-load policies for both term and permanent coverage , call the Wholesale Insurance Network ( 800-808-5810 ) , which is a broker for nine of the 10 companies that sell such policies . Where to put your savings Once your savings plan is in gear , aim to get the highest possible return on your money without taking undue risk . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher returns . For example , right now the average money-market bank account yields just 2.9% , but the highest-yielding money-market fund returns 6.2% . For most investors , mutual funds are the best option , since they offer instant diversification and professional money management at low cost . Most fund companies will let you set up automatic investing plans too . The funds you choose should be geared to your risk tolerance and the time horizon for your savings goals . Here are no-load fund picks for short- , medium- , and long-term financial goals from investment advisers and fund experts : * Short-term goals . For investment objectives that are less than two years away-such as building up an emergency fund or saving for a vacation  --  bank certificates of deposit or money-market mutual funds make the most sense . Current taxable yields : 5% to 6.2% . You can find 27 top-yielding choices listed in Your Money Monitor on page 46 . If you do n't mind taking on a tad more risk to earn higher returns , go for a short-term bond fund . Financial planner Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield : 5.7% ; 800-851-4999 ) , which holds mainly U.S. Treasury issues with maturities of two years or less . Says Ames : " The expense ratio the percentage of assets deducted each year for the fund 's costs is half a percentage point less than other short-term bond funds , which also saves you money . " Investors in the 28% tax bracket or higher ( singles with incomes of $23,350 to $56,550 ; married couples filing jointly with incomes of $39,000 to $94,250 ) , however , might get a fatter return from a short-term , tax-free municipal bond fund . An excellent choice , according to Ralph Norton , managing editor of the Investing for Income newsletter ( $59 a year ; 800-343-5413 ) , is $58 million Twentieth Century Tax-Exempt Short-Term ( yield : 4.2% ; 800-345-2021 ) , which typically buys tax-free issues with maturities under three years . This fund 's recent yield is equivalent to 5.8% for those in the 28% bracket . * Medium-term goals . Say you want to come up with a down payment on a house or buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon lets you take on more risks for higher returns than bank CDs , money funds and short-term bond funds provide . On the other hand , you do n't want to take a big gamble , either . A wise choice is an intermediate-term bond fund , which typically buys issues with maturities of five to 10 years . Historically , intermediates have matched the return of long-term Treasuries with one-third less volatility . A favorite of Kathy Stepp , a financial planner in Overland Park , Kans. , is $304 million Vanguard Bond Index Intermediate-Term ( up 15.4% since its inception in January 1994 ; yield 6.2% ; 800-851-4999 ) . With an average weighted maturity of seven years , this portfolio seeks to match-and has recently surpassed  --  the return of the Lehman Bros. intermediate-term government/corporate bond index . For those in the 28% and higher tax brackets , Norton likes $5.5 billion Vanguard Muni Intermediate ( up 7.2% in the three years through Sept. 30 ; yield 4.6% ; 800-851-4999 ) , whose returns have ranked in the top 10% of its group for the past three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more volatility is $1.1 billion Fidelity Convertible Securities ( up 14% ; 800-544-8888 ) , a favorite of Ames . The fund buys small-company convertibles  --  fixed-income issues that can be exchanged anytime for a specified number of shares of the issuing company 's stock . Over the past five years this fund has outperformed both the Lehman Bros. bond index and the S &P; 500 stock indexes with 25% less risk than the average fund . * Long-term goals . For investment objectives that lie 10 years away or more , keep 80% or more of your savings in stocks . Reason : Equities figure to give you the highest returns for the long haul . Over the past seven decades , stocks have returned an average of 10.2% annually , more than twice what you would have earned in bonds or cash investments such as money-market funds . True , stocks can drop sharply in any given year , and few experts , including MONEY 'S chief investment strategist Michael Sivy , expect 1996 to be the Wall Street picnic 1995 has been . But over all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns 97% of the time , according to Ibbotson Associates , a Chicago investment research firm . For those with only enough money to buy one fund for long-term savings , Stepp recommends $15.4 billion Vanguard Index 500 ( up 14.8% ; minimum investment $3,000 ; 800-851-4999 ) , which boasts a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.19% . If you have $10,000 or more to put away , however , you can diversify among several equity funds . Since different types of stocks rise and fall at different times , you can frequently offset losses in one sector with gains in another . That will help you reduce your risk without costing you much in return . As a first step , consider adding a small-company fund . Although small stocks are riskier than their large-company peers , over the long term they have chalked up returns that are two percentage points higher than blue chips ( 12.6% vs. 10.5% ) . A top choice , according to Jeff Kelley , managing editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds ( $395 a year ; 800-876-5005 ) , is $289 million Baron Asset ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks with market capitalizations of $1 billion or less that are likely to benefit from long-term trends , such as the aging of the population . Over the past three years , Baron Asset has delivered returns that ranked in the top 17% of its small-company peers , while its risk level ranked in the safest 19% . To fill out your roster , look for a fund that holds the stocks of companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion to $5 billion . Thurman Smith , editor of the Equity Fund Outlook newsletter ( $115 a year ; 617-397-6844 ) , prefers $1.3 billion MAS Value ( up 33.5% ; 800-354-8185 ) , which seeks out stocks that sell at a discount to their asset values . Despite its low-risk strategy , MAS Value has outgained the S &P; 500-stock index for each of the past five years . Although the fund usually requires an eye-popping minimum investment of $1 million , small investors can buy in for as little as $2,500 through the Charles Schwab brokerage . International stock funds can also add valuable diversification , particularly since many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to outpace the U.S over the next few years . Craig Litman , co-editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst ( $195 a year ; 800-776-9555 ) , likes $2.1 billion Warburg Pincus International ( up 7.6% ; 800-257-5614 ) , which typically buys blue chips in Europe . Japan and the Pacific Rim . Warburg Pincus ' five-year returns beat the Morgan Stanley EAFE international stock index by four percentage points . To capture the growth in developing countries , consider $952 million Montgomery Emerging Markets ( up 13.1% ; 800-572-3863 ) . This mutual fund focuses on companies based in rapidly expanding economies , including Brazil , Malaysia and South Korea . Though the recent performance of these markets has been rocky , this fund boasts a solid , three-year average annual gain of 13.1% and poses slightly less risk than other funds of its type . Over the past three years , this assortment of five stock funds would have delivered an annual average gain of 18.1% , nearly five percentage points more than the S &P; 500 , with slightly less risk than the typical equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings should be a cinch , without turning you into a grinch during the holidays . <p>
