<p> The postseason ballots are in , and much like the soon-to-be- concluded regular season , there are few overwhelming favorites in any of the races , Most Valuable Player the rare exception . So without further ado , here 's how one NBA columnist voted after considerable anguish and at least one last-second change . <p> MVP . David Robinson . The San Antonio center is among the league leaders in scoring ( second ) , rebounding ( fifth ) and blocks ( fourth ) , and displayed similar leadership in the club 's attempts to control the game 's reigning head case , Dennis Rodman . <p> Rookie of the Year . Jason Kidd . This was tough . Because of his consistency and superior numbers , Grant Hill owned my vote until Friday . But after watching Kidd against the Phoenix Suns , my fondness for point guards and passion for brilliant passing caused me to retrieve the old ballot and cast a new one for Dallas ' point . <p> Coach of the Year . Utah 's Jerry Sloan . Lost his starting center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to wrangle quality minutes out of limited sub Adam Keefe and ancient James Donaldson , the mechanical man himself . Besides , no one appreciates this guy . <p> Defensive Player . Dikembe Mutombo . Clogs the lane , blocks shots . What else is there ? <p> Most Improved . Dana Barros . He only needed playing time . <p> Sixth Man . Nate McMillan . A leader , defender , passer who accepts his role . <p> All-League , First Team : Scottie Pippen , Karl Malone , Robinson , Anfernee Hardaway and John Stockton . Second Team : Charles Barkley , Derrick McKey , Shaquille O'Neal , Gary Payton , Mitch Richmond . <p> POST-LABOR PAINS : In the aftermath of Charles Grantham 's shocking resignation as executive director of the Players Association - accompanied by a gag order on all player reps - the organization 's vice president , Charles Smith , hastened to assure his constituents ( and others ) that the union is continuing to function efficiently . " We are not falling apart , as some think , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident in the leadership Simon ( Gourdine ) will provide us . Buck 's ( union president Buck Williams ) decision and the executive board 's decision to accept Charlie 's resignation was for 325 players . We just had a difference in philosophy in how we wanted things run . Charlie has done a great job over the years . But he and his predecessor ( Larry Fleisher ) sort of ran things with an iron fist with no checks and balances . " Smith further expressed confidence that a new collective bargaining agreement will be reached in the near future , with t <p> Salary cap . Owners want a $ 27 million hard cap , players want a soft cap with exceptions . <p> College draft . Owners want it , players do n't . <p> Rookie cap . Owners want lids on rookie salaries , players want cap limited to three years . <p> Revenue sharing . Owners are offering players 53 to 55 percent of defined gross revenue ( they now receive 53 percent ) , primarily deriving from television , radio and ticket receipt revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gross revenue , while expanding the scope to include international properties , licensing and earnings from luxury suites . <p> Free agency . Owners want to retain restricted free agency , which allows teams to retain their own free agents by matching other offers , while players want no restrictions on player movement when contracts expire . <p> BULLETS STRIKE BACK : As the Washington Bullets near conclusion of a hugely disappointing season , Chris Webber predicted - and delivered - a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks that snapped a 13-game losing streak and precluded the setting of a franchise record . " Desperate measures , I guess , " Webber said of his vow . " I 'm not a guy who likes to guarantee a lot of things . I 'm not a psychic or anything . I knew the guys would n't let me down . " The second-year forward drilled his final 10 shots , while rookie Juwan Howard converted his final nine attempts , and tossed in 14 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter . But Webber 's remarks annoyed Bucks coach Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and guard Todd Day , who countered : " If that 's the case , he ( Webber ) should have been guaranteeing ( stuff ) all year . He did n't guarantee they 'd lose 50 games , did he ? " <p> FOULING OUT : While injuries , lousy defense and lack of incentive have contributed to the Orlando Magic 's late-season woes , the major cause has been ( surprise , surprise ) atrocious foul shooting , with Shaquille O'Neal the main culprit . Omitting Shaq 's 53.9 percent failings at the line , the team 's overall figure ( 67 percent ) improves to a respectable 74 . So what to do ? Practice , practice , and more practice , says part-time shooting coach Buzz Braman . " The shooting stroke is like a finely tuned instrument that has to be grooved and maintained on a daily basis , " said Braman , after noting that the Magic often practices in Orlando Arena , with only two baskets available . At his suggestion , an additional backboard/rim has been wheeled onto the court during practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , too late . Since 1980 , only seven NBA teams have shot worse than 70 percent from the line during the regular season , and none made it beyond the first round of the playoffs . <p> AROUND THE ARENAS : Though back in the starting lineup after seven games as the Suns ' sixth man , Kevin Johnson still seems miffed about the demotion . His target , naturally , is coach Paul Westphal . " I 've defended him for a long time , his stances , his philosophy as a coach , his relationship with players , etc. , " began the ever tactful KJ . " Going into the playoffs , I think it 's important for there to be limited division . I think we need to challenge each other and communicate . But I do n't think now is the time to turn your back on each other . So , therefore , I support him . " . . . Lamond Murray 's one-game suspension reportedly was levied after he erupted during a conversation with coach Bill Fitch , who had urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensively . " When you start seeing a guy 's game drift away from him , there 's no sense to let it ( continue ) , " said Fitch . " ( The punishment is ) nothing personal . It just reflects on basketball and his basketball personality . " . . . What a year for Bobby Hurley . He recovers . He returns . He regresses . Finally , after straining his back while playing one-on-one prior to pre-game warmups , the second-year point guard was placed on the injured list for the season 's final week . Kings officials privately are conceding that Hurley is a bust and looking elsewhere for their future point guard . . . . Just when Chris Ford appeared destined for the same fate as the old Boston Garden ( out of here ) , the Celtics ' late surge ( won eight of 10 ) is said to be muddling matters . . . . Mark Price 's latest ailment ( an inflamed foot tendon ) is more common in great leapers , leaving the Cavs ' veteran uncertain how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . After receiving a cortisone shot on Monday , Price allowed , " That will make you cry . " . . . As they neared conclusion of a franchise-first 50-win season , the Hornets made plans for a pre-playoff mini-camp beginning Monday in Augusta . . . . Where have you gone , Reggie Miller ? The Pacers ' sharpshooter has averaged 13.6 points the last seven games and shot 33.8 percent , yet insists he is not in a slump . His coach , Larry Brown , seems to disagree . Seems to believe Reggie 's woes are season-long , and instead is touting McKey and Rik Smits as the team 's MVPs . Adds point guard Mark Jackson , a former teammate of Danny Manning and an even bigger fan of the versatile McKey , " I 've never played with a guy that has the package like him . People just do n't realize what he does for this basketball team . "
