Helmut Kohl and Germany look like a good physical match : the tall , burly Chancellor casts as large a political shadow at home as his powerful country does across the European Continent . While Kohl needed a lot of help from his coalition partners to win a fourth straight four-year term last week , he was the real issue of the campaign . Some posters carried only his portrait , without bothering to mention his name or that of his Christian Democratic Party . Unfazed when popularity polls showed him trailing 11% early this year , he insisted he would still win the national election . As his prediction came true , he smiled and asked , " What more could I have hoped for ? " <P> Well , possibly a larger majority . He and his partners from the Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party will control the new 672-member Bundestag by only 10 seats  --  a drop of 124 from four years ago . No one has forgotten how swiftly and confidently Kohl engineered Germany 's unification , but this electoral decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price he paid for a steep post-union recession , now ending , and the resentment felt in both eastern and western Germany over the high cost of bringing them together . Even so , unified Germany stuck with Kohl 's leadership . <P> In the capitals of Europe and in Washington as well , that was excellent news . Demonstrations of continuity and stability are particularly welcomed from Germany , the colossus of Western Europe and the world 's No. 3 industrial economy . Most of Germany 's neighbors were at least a bit apprehensive about how the country would behave after coming triumphantly together five years ago , but Kohl 's administration has reassured them . " Germany is not what it was in the past , " says a French government official in Paris . German neo- Nazis have committed shocking public atrocities , but they do not presage a national trend toward extremism . An important proof : the far-right Republican Party took only 1.9% of last week 's vote . <P> One criticism Germany 's neighbors sometimes make about Kohl is that he is preoccupied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd charge to lay against a man dedicated to expanding the Atlantic alliance and making the European Union live up to its name . " Germany , " says a senior NATO official in Brussels , " is probably the only major country that is whole- heartedly committed to both NATO and the European Union . " Germans must realize , Kohl said last week , that their new unity " will be wasted if we do n't press ahead in parallel with European unity . " <P> Kohl wants to see Germany so embedded in European institutions that it will never again be tempted to swing its weight alone . He is so eager to create a common currency and a common foreign policy that he is willing to do so in a two-tier union , with an inner core of those ready to move forward by the end of this decade and an outer ring of those not financially or politically ready .
