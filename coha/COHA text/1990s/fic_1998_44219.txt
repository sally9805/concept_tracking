The Land of Nod , according to the word , was located East of Eden and made of desert . Phoenix , it seemed , had become for her the place to try again-a second chance , hope where there is life , however tentatively , and thanks to modern irrigation . In college for the very first time , Natalie read about mythology , as well as architecture and current social ills . To make ends meet , she was paid to care for the elderly-twelve hours a day , three days a week . She lived beside the university then and had been clean for seven months . She 'd left her son in the Midwest , at first believing someday she might be able to buy him back . The state of Michigan had legislated certain preconditions that , given her history , she had not been expected by anybody , certainly not the legislators of the state , to meet . <p> Nights , she took her classes , slowly at first , one at a time . She bought a second-hand motorcycle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home , she began to think about a career in social services . She was almost nineteen , and life , she felt certain , could be endured only by way of keeping busy . In rehab , along with her obligatory confessions , she had been expected to congratulate herself for her courage . Change was not easy , people said , even if you did n't have to . There she 'd thought about her baby often . Her mother visited and brought a picture , blown up poster-size , for her to pin up on her wall beside an illustration of the Rocky Mountains . In the poster , her three-year-old son is wearing a new outfit , purchased by a pair of loving foster parents , and in this light , he did n't appear to have anything wrong with him at all . During his pregnancy , she 'd managed to keep herself clean , for his sake , and it had now become conceivable he could grow up to be a banker or a clergyman . When she took the poster down , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't love your son ? What 's wrong with you ? " <p> " I love my son , " she said . In an hour , she was expected to be in Group . After two more weeks , she would be free to leave the institution , complete with a new and inexpensive lease on life , though of course she had no idea where she would go , or if she would stay , here in Phoenix , which was n't quite as far west as Los Angeles , where there was an ocean and a beach . She said , practicing to remain calm , " I love my son . " <p> " You love your son ? You take his picture down ? I bought that picture for you to remember him ! " <p> Her mother lit a cigarette , the third since breakfast . Over the years , her mother 's skin had yellowed , and she appeared increasingly on the verge of being diagnosed with something terminal , which frightened Natalie : not the threat of death , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You do n't love anybody , do you ? You 're a selfish bitch , Natalie . You are a selfish bitch . " <p> It was the same old song . Now her mother began to cry . Then , before leaving for home in Michigan , where her mother would arrive in time to watch a couple hours worth of television until her third husband left for work , she made Natalie hug her for several moments . <p> " This place is so much nicer than the other , " her mother said , leaving . " You should be grateful . " <p> This place had been furnished by a television talk-show host , Lucinda ! Her mother had written to Lucinda , who actually went by Lucia , along with Donahue and Oprah and Sally Jesse , in an appeal for help . Her daughter was living on the streets , had become a prostitute , had lost her grandchild to the state . Could n't somebody please help ? Because Natalie was fairly middle-class , and Italian , as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to structure a show around Natalie 's recovery : White Girls Who Do Heroin . One week after Natalie had been arrested in Detroit , thrown into a tank , and then a state detox , Lucia flew her out to Los Angeles to do the story . She also flew out her mother and her grandmother , whom Natalie had n't seen since she was five , and a neighborhood friend , Kyle . Her grandmother had aged considerably and Kyle , who had always been a little bit in love with her , barely said a word . He was there mostly to show support , he said , nervously ; he was embarrassed by his crutches . On the air , Natalie had been clean for less than seven days , and Lucia permitted her to smoke . <p> Lucia had paid the price of the new rehab , which generally catered to middle class youths with health insurance ; the food was decent , and most of the patients were closer to her age . She 'd started at fourteen , turning tricks a year later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to college and doing homework ; she was caring for the elderly at Hacienda Home and riding around Phoenix , Arizona , on a motorcycle . The heroin had kept her thin , and consequently beautiful , and she was repeatedly being hit on by fraternity boys at the university-an Italian girl , driving around town on a motorcycle in torn jeans and a tank . Usually , they just wanted to drink a lot of beer , maybe get laid some lonesome Friday . Usually she put them off by saying she had to go to a meeting , by which they thought she meant something akin to Student Government or possibly even Church . <p> Miraculously she had not become HIV positive . In Phoenix , she believed the desert heat would be good for her ; she cut her hair short , the first time in her life , and began to make adjustments to her persona : no make-up , for example , or frilly dresses . She asked people to call her Nat , which took a while getting used to-a source of constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had first been tested for HIv in rehab , but it took her several months to summon up the courage to test herself again , to make certain she had n't acquired the virus through its diagnostic window . Her lover , an evangelical Catholic named William , insisted that it would n't matter , though of course she knew it would . She 'd kept him at bay for several weeks with hand-jobs and apologies until one night after she cut her toe on a piece of broken glass in his kitchen . He 'd searched through cabinets for antiseptic and band-aids , and when he reached for her foot , urging that she rest it on his lap , she 'd pulled it back , insisting . <p> " No , " she said . " Do n't you see ? I 'm not safe ! " <p> " Nonsense , Nat . You tell me what 's safe . " <p> William soaked her toe in a bowl of water , removed a shard of glass with tweezers from a pocket knife : generally , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran electrical conduit for a construction firm . His job was to make sure the current was alive and hot . He 'd been around the block enough times to know that it was mostly square-downright boring once you figured out the plumbing , he 'd say , which nonetheless always seemed to work . To keep the dream alive-especially your own-what was needed was adventure . Now he wanted to go to Africa or Latin America as part of a missionary group to provide relief . He had friends high up in the diocese who could pull certain strings . Still , given the number of people she had been with , the number of shared needles and whatnot , she believed it inconceivable she could still be safe . According to the Surgeon General , the odds increased exponentially just by shaking hands . <p> " I do n't want you to get sick , " she said . <p> " I 'm not going to get sick . " <p> " Yeah ? How do you know ? How do you know that , William ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . " You know ? Like when you go outside and stand on the lawn ? You stand there , and a car comes by , and you just know it 's not going to hit you . Could it hit you ? Sure . But is it going to ? No . The car is not going to drive up onto my lawn and hit me . " <p> " I 'm not a car , William . " <p> " Faith , " he said . " Things not yet seen ? " <p> Like a forthcoming audience with your treatment counselor , or guardian angel . She belonged , of course , to Saint Christopher . As for William , he was close to twenty years her senior . He owned both a house and a renovated airplane . Weekends , he 'd fly her down to Tijuana , where they 'd walk along the streets , longing for an opportunity to do some good . William knew she 'd had a drug problem-they 'd met in NA , a daytime group that he had personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some understanding of certain elements of her past , those things a sixteen-year-old addict does to get by on the streets of Detroit , she had still never told him about her son , or her mother , or her patron , Lucia , in Los Angeles , who had sent Natalie her home phone number as well as checks twice a month to help her with tuition . Lately William had been encouraging her to move in with him . If he found a mission , they 'd have to be married , at least on paper . Living together , he argued , they could get used to living a normal life . What the Pope did n't know would n't hurt him . <p> That night , caution to the wind , they made love proper the very first time . They made love first on the sofa , the light falling in through the blinds , her toe bandaged with gauze . She had to be careful not to bump it . She had to be careful with her teeth . William was expert primarily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Over the years , her body had become far too distant for her mind to ever fully reach . It was something one learned to live in , the best you could , and it was something you learned to take advantage of so long as you could use it to bring you comfort . If you fed the body-smack , an occasional blueberry muffin-it kept you free from side effects . You did n't have to bother with the intrusions of a boyfriend who sold you to his friends , or a cop , who promised to drive you home if you were good . By good , he did n't necessarily mean behavior . The body , she reasoned then , had been constructed for the use of others , particularly a man who claimed to need it . Even the body of Christ had been given up to feed the world , each and every day , all over the world . The body needed to be fed because the world was hungry . It was that simple , as well as complicated , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because that 's what pleasure needed-the right to be first announced , in a dark room , on your lover 's sofa . Then it made her angry , this unexpected surprise . She locked herself inside the bathroom and wept for hours . <p> She had herself tested anonymously the next day , waited dutifully for the results-an appointment that she began to postpone : first a day , then lingering into the next week . Thursday , after her shift at the Hacienda Home , where she 'd spent an hour reading to a man who claimed to be on a Caribbean cruise , she exchanged the hospital coat for her leather jacket and ran out to her motorcycle in back . She had been instructed to park it behind the kitchen in order to facilitate appearances . The motorcycle would n't start at first , and she took this slight malfunction to be a sign of her potentially broken future . Then , quite unexpectedly , it did start , which scared her at first . Eventually she adjusted her helmet and mirrors and pulled out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she always recognized as familiar territory-the street , and the excessive car exhaust , and the boys and girls , hustling . Waiting for a light , she watched a pimp drop off a girl beside a telephone booth . Even from this distance , the girl had hollow cheeks and tracks in her arms . The pimp pulled away and Natalie turned the corner , paused , then stopped at the phone booth . <p> The girl smiled pathetically and asked Natalie if she 'd like a date . <p> Then Natalie removed her helmet . She smiled at the girl . At first she considered , as if by instinct , asking for a place to buy . <p> " You 're a girl , " the girl said , shrugging . " No matter . " <p> " You need a bath , " Natalie said , gently . " You need some food ? " <p> " Makes me sick , " the girl said , nervously . " He 's going to be back . He 's gon na drive around the block and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to- " <p> " Shh , " Natalie said . " I know . " Now she reached into her jeans and located a ten dollar bill , folded into the size of a coin . She passed the girl the money and said , " No strings . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " I just got tested , " Natalie said . " You know what I mean ? I been clean seven months . Now I 'm getting my results . I lost my baby . I got scars in between my toes . " She smiled now , turned to check the traffic . " I know somebody who can help . " <p> " Jesus ? " <p> " No , " Natalie said , looking up at the clouds . " He 's long gone . " <p> " Me , then . I 'm supposed to help myself ? What makes you think I need any help ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Natalie said . " I meant to do something good . " <p> " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She pulled out into the traffic , feeling apologetic and inexpressibly sinful . She had n't meant to show off-a housewife at a meeting , having driven there in her forty thousand dollar car , wallowing in some private moment of suburban indiscretion . Driving , Natalie began to cry , which was becoming increasingly common . Watching television , reading her mythology , looking up at the sky , she found herself constantly breaking down . Her teacher said the Phoenix was a bird before it became a city ; personally , she 'd prefer to be a bird , flaming and aloft . William had said she was catching up with a lot of grief , that it was all perfectly natural , by which he also meant her desire to be a bird . It was healthy , he said , all this crying . . a grieving process , he called it , as if it had become a way to build something sturdy . Mostly it just made it difficult to see clearly inside your motorcycle helmet . Eventually she switched lanes and pulled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cold , she wiped her eyes and bought a pack of cigarettes . <p> Outside , she sat on her helmet , lit a cigarette and took a drag . The curb , she noticed , was hot and scattered with butts . And it made her dizzy , the nicotine , flushing into her bloodstream . She 'd found she could quit smoking on a day 's notice , no problem whatsoever . She held no interest in alcohol . And she realized , sitting there , that she had talked herself into finding a place to score . It terrified her , realizing that . Now she turned up her wrist to examine her veins . Her veins were blue and , from this distance , seemed to be located in a remarkably distant place . <p> " No , " she said , coming home , her head in her hands . " No . No no no . " <p> Then a man walking by , six-pack in hand , asked her if she 'd like a ride . <p> Sebastian , she realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen arrows . <p> The next day she tried again . She read to the man on the Caribbean cruise from her second-hand copy of Classical Mythology . He liked the love stories best , he said , shielding his eyes . Then she said goodbye and exchanged her coat for her jacket and drove her motorcycle to the clinic , brushed her hair from her eyes , and walked into the building as if she knew precisely what she was doing . The clinic was located in a deserted mall on Thomas Street . The chairs were orange plastic , filthy , covered with soot . A pregnant white girl was reading a magazine . Natalie was instructed to wait beside the pregnant girl and magazines until her counselor , a maternal-looking Hispanic , called her in for her results . <p> The woman 's name tag read Juanita . She wore the same kind of lab coat Natalie wore at Hacienda Home in order to appear professional . <p> " Natalie ? " Juanita said , sitting behind her desk . <p> " Nat , " Natalie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , generously . " Clean bill of health . " <p> At first she believed she had done something wrong again . Mostly it was n't supposed to be this easy . She wanted to have a reason to make herself feel bad , if only to provide an explanation for her condition , this constant state of inexplicable sorrow , and she waited expectantly for Juanita to finish asking questions about her lifestyle . Drugs , sexual histories , certain preconditions which might have prompted this particular visit-each of which , the questions , was entirely humiliating and required by law . <p> " This is my second test , " Natalie said , finally . " To confirm . " <p> " So , " Juanita said , smiling . " It 's been confirmed then ? " <p> " I 'm safe , " Natalie said . " I mean , I 'm really safe ? " <p> " It 's like a birthday , " Juanita said , happily . " A brand new holiday ! " <p> " Easter , " Natalie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desk . Apparently she shared it often . Possibly this was a good thing ? <p> " The thing , " Juanita said , sadly . " The thing about starting over . . . the thing is , you know you 've done it before . Eventually , you even get pretty good at it . " <p> She thought about it all the way home-starting over , which she was beginning to get used to . She 'd gone through detox before : starting over simply meant you had n't got it right the time before . At best , it was a good thing to keep secret , and she knew now where this line of thought was going . Just down the road , where she 'd also been before , and she discovered later that night she wanted to be fuckednot raped , which would allow for martyrdom , and therefore complicity , but instead a moment of pure and simple disabuse . She wanted to lay herself down before a stranger and have returned to her a source of probable cause . Pain becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its origin . Being healthy , eating three meals , not putting yourself willingly into a place of senseless danger , she had proved to herself she could do all this . She could be a good person of capital disposition . She knew how to behave . What she did n't understand was how anybody could possibly endure it-the numbing ennui that her mother had mistaken for the good and religious life . Her mother , before she divorced her second husband , had managed to slit her veins with a broken bottle of Scotch . Natalie had called the paramedics . She 'd been wasted then , doing even that . Her mother was lying in a pool of blood and Natalie was sitting on the floor , smoking a cigarette , admiring the way it traveled . The blood reached her bare ankles , sprawled on the linoleum , before the paramedics finally arrived . They asked Natalie if she was all right . Then they left the phone number of a counselor who could help . That day on television , in Los Angeles and before all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie 's general lack of gratefulness . <p> " What do you want her to say ? " Lucia asked . <p> " I want her to say she loves me , " her mother said . " I want to hear her say she loves me ! " <p> Lucia then turned to the audience , to allow for commentary , most of which was innocent and sweet , and then a commercial break . Afterward , when Lucia came to visit Natalie at the hospital , the one for the well-insured , Lucia explained that her own sister was an addict . Her sister had given up her husband and her children and was hooking somewhere in San Francisco . Lucia said , hugging Natalie , " I ca n't help my sister . Your mother ca n't help you . But I sure can give you money . " <p> " I do n't want your money , " Natalie said . <p> " Course you do , Girl . What you do n't want is guilt . " <p> " Okay , " Natalie said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to hang that up if you do n't want to . This is about you . This is about you getting yourself well . The rest of the world 's going to do just fine without you . " <p> And then Lucia brought in a box full of viewer-mail . There were hundreds of letters . " Have n't had so many since that show on witches in the public schools . You know , brooms ? " The letters were mostly by parents and recovering addicts , a couple by high school teachers offering encouragement , another dozen by men asking for a date . Lucia pointed to all the letters and said , laughing , " This- . Now this is the power of the spoken word ! " <p> By now Natalie was clear-headed enough to find her situation entirely remarkable , including Lucia 's kindness and affection . Natalie had watched Lucia on television enough to know that she was funny , particularly when she put on her black act , getting folksy with the audience . What she did n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose cornrows smelled mildly of sweat , and whose body felt strong enough to become safe in . When Lucia put her arms around her and squeezed , one last time , Natalie asked her for another favor . <p> " What ? Now you want some stamps ? " <p> " Do n't let my mother back in here . Please . " <p> Among other things , Lucia was true to her word . She had the doctors prohibit , politely , any further visitation from her mother . Lucia had n't even asked for Natalie to do a follow-up episode . Instead , she gave Natalie her home number and told her to feel free to call . " Anytime , anyplace . You just give me a call . " <p> She still had n't used that number : instead , she carried it on a piece of paper tucked inside her wallet-a last , secret wish . And of course it was more complicated than that ; a dissolute life involved more than merely trying to blame your mother . Her mother was pathetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her keep her grandchild . But it 's not as if her mother did n't have her own and private reasons . That night , after receiving from Juanita a clean bill of health , Natalie went to class-a night class filled with several hundred students , during which she wrote her son a letter . In it she told her son about the desert and the cactus and all the friends she had-this , she thought , was the advantage of the written word : it was easier to lie . It was easier to cross things out . After class she gathered up her books from beneath her chair , crumpled up her letter and wandered outside toward a parking lot . The sky was dark and hopeful . The air smelled like semen and in the distance she could hear sprinklers watering the grass . Then it struck her , as if by accident , that she did n't have any place to go . She sat on a dry patch of lawn in order to watch the students pass . They carried with them their books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed , thanks to a forgiving code of conduct and daytime television . To get wasted , to take your friend 's lover to bed , to oversleep for class-that 's about as bad as things could get . <p> Sitting there , she remembered sucking off her mother 's second husband in exchange for twenty bucks . She remembered being raped inside a dumpster behind an Italian restaurant : there were three of them altogether . When she woke , she could n't find her clothes , and her hair smelled like garlic . Her neighbor , Kyle , had come to find her . Kyle was newly wed , they had grown up on the same block , and he confessed often to wanting a divorce . Often her mother would call Kyle in the middle of the night , and Kyle would go out and find her , cruising the streets , and then he 'd drive Natalie home to his house , give her a bath , brush her knotted hair and feed her ice cream . After a while , she could n't even keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . She lived with Kyle and his new wife while she was pregnant . The new wife was having an affair with a cop ; days , while Kyle was at work , skinning hides , the cop would come over and do the new wife on the rented furniture inside the living room . After the baby was born , Kyle got drunk and hit the new wife with a brick , and then the cop showed up in the driveway and shot Kyle in the knee-it took several operations to fix . Then her mother took the baby , because she insisted on it , and Natalie was in no condition to argue : mostly because she just wanted to die . She hitched a ride downtown ; at best , it should n't take more than a couple months . Kyle , meanwhile , began cruising the streets , looking for her , his knee in a brace , his crutches splashing through the puddles and shit . After a public drunk , her mother lost the baby to social services , and mostly , right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , she wanted to remember the details of this life . It had , after all , been hers . But instead she could recall only how it made her feel-empty , entirely hollowed out , as if by a knife . There was n't even any reason left to bleed . <p> Being an addict , recovering or otherwise . . . it was n't meant to be easy . She knew that . She knew , too , that mostly you had to watch out for the past : the way it could contort the present moment , which was yours not to screw up unless you really planned for it . It took good hard work to be healthy , something to be proud of , especially when you could n't any longer find a reason : simply , it was so much easier to die . She thought of her son , who would be turning four soon . Years from now , she would have no idea what he would look like . Probably she would have to rely on her mother to send some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the letter she had written , and it made her feel foolish , writing to a four year old . It made her realize she was standing in dangerous territory , some lonely place caught between longing and regret , and she dropped the letter into a wastebasket . She slung her books across her shoulder and made her way beneath the city lights . <p> At William 's house , he was sitting on the sofa , rifling through a stack of brochures on Somalia . He pointed to some starving and photogenic children and said , " Look , Nat , we could be of use here . " <p> She poured herself a Diet Coke in the kitchen . She said , sitting down beside him , " Do you have to have a passport ? " <p> " Of course ! " <p> " I mean , a special kind ? You know-like for secret agents ? I thought all those people were spies . " <p> In Somalia , she thought , there would n't be anybody to have a meeting with . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either-at least not so easily relieved , and was n't it the possibility of sin , the very accessibility of it all , which made you hungry ? Instead they could swat flies and carry sacks of grain and bury the dead by the hundred-fold . In the morning , William said , shifting his weight , in the morning he was going to fly up to the Grand Canyon . There was a priest up on the res he wanted to have breakfast with . The priest spoke in tongues , William said . He was one of the faithful . He was being pressured by the elders to cast his vote for a casino . <p> She sat back into the deep couch . He put his arm around her and said , " Rough day ? " <p> " Sad . Just sad . " <p> " You want to go up north with me ? We could buzz the Colorado ? We 're going to help with some houses , too . " <p> " Jesus , " she said , blinking . " You really believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , do you really pray to Jesus ? " <p> " Only when I 'm lonely , " William said , laughing . <p> " So it 's a show ? It 's a performance ? " <p> " It 's God , " William said . " Call it what you like . Supreme Being ? Captain Higher Power ? In this country , Jesus tends to win more votes because he 's handsome . " <p> She began to cry , softly , her face in his chest . She realized he was older than her father . She realized she did n't even know where he had been born . <p> " What ? What 's happening , Nat ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " I guess I was kind of hoping it might have been true . You know ? I mean , I 've always wanted it to be true . " <p> " Of course it 's true . It has to be true , Nat . How else would we be here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit late to try and do away with the inquisition . " He ruffled her hair , the back of her neck , which had been closely shaved . " Just because it 's myth does n't mean it is n't true . " <p> " So everything 's going to be all right ? Tomorrow 's going to be a better day ? " <p> He lifted her face . He kissed her eyes and said , " Of course not , Nat . Do n't you see ? That 's what makes us different . We know better . " <p> She smiled , wiping her eyes . " I 'm not sick , " she said . " The results came in . " <p> He nodded , because of course he 'd known it all along . Because she had a long life to live and was n't going to be let off so easily . " Those who can , " William liked to say , especially over coffee , " those who can , must . " <p> She was afraid to stay the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her sleep , which at this rate was going to take hours to arrive-sleep , and the possibility for escape , however briefly . She kissed William at the door and drove home , slowly , in order to extend the trip . Once home , she 'd merely have to sit in her chair , overlooking the pool of a neighboring apartment complex , waiting for the sunrise . When the sun rose , it would hit the water and set the world aflame-the fine and glorious conflagration of the day . At seven , she could go to Mass , which for a while would make her feel as if she were part of something , if only the congregation-the sleepy and the hopeful , ducking into a cool church , just beyond reach of the sun . Driving , the streets now finally quiet , the air cutting through her jeans and socks , she relished the warmth from the engine . At night in the desert , driving fifty miles an hour , it was possible to chill yourself to the bone . The bike felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that felt-the moment the sun rose , simply because it had to , because it had become a law . In order to stay alive , to redeem the past , to forgive yourself for the life you were still afraid to take , one day and into the next , the sun still had to rise . Otherwise , all was dark , and cold as rock . <p> That night she had a dream she died . <p> William flew up north to the reservation . He called , two days later , to say he wanted to finish up wiring a block of houses . He said on the phone , excitedly , " They did n't know I understood electricity ! " <p> In the background , she could hear trucks driving . <p> " The government built the brothers ' houses without wire ! Tax dollars , you know . Now all we got ta do is find a decent plumber . " He said , " Lights , rock ' n ' roll , a kitchen stove . These guys want it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before hanging up . <p> " Next week- " he said . " Next week , you 'll come too ? " <p> " Okay , " she said , knowing she had made a promise . " Okay , sure . " <p> Afterward , hanging up , she realized it had n't been that hard a thing to do-saying yes . She went to Hacienda Home and emptied bed pans . She helped the kitchen staff set up lunch , and then after she helped clear she read to her friend on the Caribbean cruise . Several times he complimented the captain , interrupting her reading , for steering so well through the stormy seas . Once he reached for her arm , firmly , and said , " He 's really a very fine captain , you know . He ate with us at our table just the other night . He speaks French . " <p> " Would you like another blanket ? " she asked . <p> " Oh yes . Yes . It 's cold up here on deck . " <p> She closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of his bed : the magic of cotton , the way it could warm you just so . Then she went into the kitchen and asked the cooks for a slice of lime , which she put into a cup of water with a pink Japanese umbrella . When she returned , she set the cup on his nightstand , compliments of the crew . <p> " Oh , " he said , beaming . " Oh , bless your heart . " <p> The man was dying , though by the looks of it he had a few more years to go . The body could last far longer than the brain , or heart . The body , it was a wonder , the way it took you places : here , then there . Once it took her to a park , just east of the city , where she offered to blow a man if he 'd buy her a muffin . It had to be blueberry , she remembered that . She was on her knees , begging in a park , just shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slush and tore her jeans . The man , she recognized later , turned out to be Kyle : she had forgotten about the crutches and the brace . It took an hour to make it to his car-somehow , he managed to carry her parts of the way . Now he wrote her letters she left unanswered . To become capable of being loved , she realized , one first had to learn how to give it properly . <p> Having so decided , she left work early and drove her motorcycle downtown . She stopped at a bank machine , and then a pharmacy , gathering various items-soap , lotion , pellucid , and shampoo-and then she explained to the pharmacist that she was diabetic and had left her kit in Los Angeles and he gave her a half dozen needles . He was Lebanese and did n't speak English too well , he said . He said he hoped a pretty girl like her would enjoy her stay . <p> Outside , on the street , she parked her bike and waited for her friend . She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shakes . First she recognized the pimp 's car , a white job with chrome wheels and stripes , and then she finished up her coffee . <p> The street was hot today . The girl did n't recognize her . Her eye was swollen-she 'd been hit . She smiled at Natalie and expected her to pass by . <p> " It 's me , " Natalie said . <p> " Me ? " <p> " Yeah . You know , the other day ? Does n't matter . " <p> " You like- " <p> " I 'll pay . " <p> " So , yeah . Sure . " <p> " Thing is , you got ta come with me . " <p> " Yeah , I know , " the girl said , remembering . " You know somebody who can help . You know Jesus . You know the Mayor ? " <p> " I know these motels , " Natalie said . " Let 's find a Days Inn . A Comfort Inn . Someplace where they let you in politely . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was clear she 'd been here before . She knew to lean with the turns , and not against , and she gripped her hands around Natalie 's waist and said , loudly and into the wind , " I got ta be back in an hour . I mean , he 's gon na check on me . " <p> She found a motel that looked safe enough and had several stories and orange balconies . Natalie bought the room , took the key and led the girl around back . The girl 's name , she said , going up the steps , was Sofia . " But you can call me Tanya . " <p> " What 's you 're real name ? " <p> " Anything . Changes all the time . Depends . Usually it 's Sofia . You know , " she said , stopping , " you can just give me a ten and take me back . I mean , if you change your mind or anything . You can just give me a ten spot and we can call this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Natalie said , turning on the steps . She took the girl by the shoulders and looked her in the eyes . " You 're sick ? " <p> " No . Not yet . " <p> " Look at me . I promise . Nothing bad . " <p> Inside , Natalie ran a bath , then quickly poured in the pellucid . The girl went to the radiator and looked out the window . She reached for the drapes , sighed , and left them open . She took off her T-shirt and jeans and underwear . She said , standing there , balancing her weight from one foot to the other , " You change your mind , it 's okay . I said that . I let people do that all the time . " <p> " You 're pretty , " Natalie said . " It 's not that . I want you to take a bath . You 'll feel better . " <p> " You gon na take off your clothes ? You just want to watch me do stuff ? What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " Natalie said . <p> The girl laughed , as if in disbelief . <p> " No , " Natalie said . " That 's not what I mean . " <p> The room smelled like cigarette smoke , which provided Natalie an excuse to light one . She lit a cigarette and pointed to the bath . The girl was shivering with the air-conditioning . The girl said , clearly making a decision , " I got ta call him . He 's gon na come back and then he 's gon na be really mad and beat the shit out me if I do n't tell . " <p> The girl sat on the edge of the bed and made the call . She promised double , she said into the phone . Back in a couple hours , maybe five . There was a lot of yelling on the other end before she hung up . Then she reached into her bag for her works . She said , " These places , they always give me the creeps . Never stops . " She filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , wait , " and she gave her a fresh syringe . <p> " Clean , " Natalie said . " Doctor fresh . " <p> " I do n't share with anybody , " the girl said . " Anybody . Do n't you like television ? You want me to turn on the television ? Sometimes it helps , you know . To break the ice . " <p> She could n't find a vein . Natalie removed her belt and wrapped it around the girl 's thigh . She pulled it hard , then again , cinching it , and the girl said , " The calf . Got ta use the calf . Nobody looks there , anyway , " and then she found the vein and then the heroin entered the girl 's bloodstream behind the bruises and she sat there , utterly dazed . After a while she managed to drop the syringe on the floor . She lay back on the bed and said , " Hey , stranger . " <p> " Hey , " Natalie said . <p> " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can help . " <p> The girl was almost light enough to lift , but not quite . " The nods , " Natalie said , remembering . <p> " Sweet , " said the girl . <p> It took several minutes before together they made it to the tub . The water was perfect-safe enough for the elbow , then the wrist , which was precisely the way Natalie had been taught . Her son would cry at first , in the water , and then he would begin to splash , one foot at a time . The girl lay in the tub and Natalie scrubbed her hair . <p> " What ? No , " said the girl . " Do n't do that . " <p> " I 'm good at this , " Natalie said . " I 've had a lot of practice . Go ahead , close your eyes . " <p> " You 're a junkie like me , " the girl said , sleepily , " you know lots of people . " <p> " I 'm a junkie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night , I had a dream . You do n't have to do this . You do n't have to let this happen . You know ? Because I know all about it . I know and this is n't the part that 's going to kill you . Heroin , that 's the easy part . This is n't the bad part . Getting beat-up and whatnot-that 's easy . The bad part 's what comes after and knowing you 're going to live through it . That 's the bad part and I know all about it . " <p> The girl folded her arms across her chest , which would hide the tracks in her arms . Natalie knew that people had been good to herLucia , who lived in Los Angeles , and Kyle , and others she had known , usually on the street . In the fifth grade , in Michigan , she once knew a boy who had a crush . In the fifth grade , she was still good , as opposed to bad : then one day it was easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd learned about it in counseling , but in counseling it had n't made much sense . You said you were powerless , et cetera , but you did n't feel it . You did n't know it the way you knew your own clothes and the way they fit , depending on the weather . For that you had to wait for some unexpected moment in a motel room with a television in order to help break the ice . <p> The girl dozed , naked in the tub , while Natalie shampooed her hair . She recycled the water in the tub and poured in bath oil to counterbalance the disinfectant . She turned the temperature up and sat on the lid of the toilet and held the girl 's hand and realized it was n't hard as she thought it might have been-doing good , providing comfort to somebody you still might any day become . There were easier things , and harder things , than simply being clean ; someday , she might be able to tell Lucia , and then she realized this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this moment with her first to Latin America , or Africa , and then to all the other places she was going to live . In her dream , the dream in which she dies , she is riding her motorcycle on a dark street , and by the time she hears it coming , she knows she has n't heard it : the chain , which slips , at first a pleasant sensation until the rear end begins to slide . Coming around an intersection , she understands she needs to lay the bike down gently as she can . She understands that to fail at this is to fail at life . And when her jacket rips , first at the seams , and then into shreds , she knows her skin is just beneath . She ca n't feel her leg beneath the bike , but eventually her jeans begin to vanish , and what 's left becomes muscle and bone , and her elbow , shaving the asphalt , and she knows she will be unable to wake before she begins to feel any pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as she dies bleeding on the street beneath a sea of streetlamps , she knows there never will be . The pain is in the living , not the dying , which is why nobody ever understands it . What 's left is the body , demoralized and broken , lying on the pavement , and a final opportunity for somebody else to speak . Usually it 's William , flying overhead in his airplane , waving . If she could lift her arm , then possibly she might be able to wave back , because it 's her dream . She knows this . It 's a dream that belongs strictly to the body in which she lives . And to change the dream , first you have to make it welcome . You have to find a safe place to sleep and you need a little time and opportunity and you need to understand the current of the final word . . . Mercy . Sweet , sweet mercy . . . because otherwise , otherwise you 're just a girl , lying naked in the tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost longing for a chance to touch the dirt . Otherwise you 're just another body without another place to go . <p> " Home , " she said to the girl , holding her hand . " Why do n't you let me take you home ? " <p>
