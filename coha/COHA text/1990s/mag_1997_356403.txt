China 's top leadership , now that Deng Xiaoping is gone , looks like the ducks on a quiet pond in Zhongnanhai , the palatial government compound in Beijing . The ducks swim along serenely and smoothly . But below the surface their legs are paddling furiously , spreading unseen turbulence . They may or may not change places in their parade , but everyone watching knows that real effort goes into it . <P> That 's not exactly the image Beijing is promoting . The official line is that the transition from the Deng era to that of President Jiang Zemin happened years ago and is locked firmly in place : Jiang was Deng 's chosen successor , and he has handily gathered up the reins of power . Well , it would not be China or the Communist Party if that were true . Even under the red emperors Mao Zedong and Deng , as with the real emperors of the past , there were constant plots and purges . But Chinese and Western experts do generally agree that none of Jiang 's potential rivals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Although Jiang is clearly ranked above his colleagues in the leadership , power plays seem inevitable , probably timed to the next Party Congress this fall , where the new leadership will be confirmed . At that meeting , says a Chinese analyst in Beijing , " some people will get jobs , and others will lose theirs . " The main contenders will try to strengthen their positions and prepare for the day Jiang trips over a policy or runs into a crisis he ca n't handle . <P> For now , Jiang , 70 , is better positioned than most people expected . The portly technocrat , a former mayor and party boss of Shanghai , has been a national figure only since 1989 , and he is regularly dismissed as a lightweight and a weather vane who swings with the political winds . In fact he has shown a lot of political savvy since Deng called him to Beijing in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre . With Deng 's help he took on all the posts that matter : President , General Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jiang did not let it rest at titles . He went on to build a network beholden to him . He fired scores of civilian , military and police officials and filled their jobs with his own appointees . He promoted Shanghai colleagues to the Politburo and shook up regional party organizations . During the past seven years he has done very well for a leader supposedly without a power base . <P> Those who dismiss Jiang as a transitional chief say he has no charisma , no military experience , no long career as a revolutionary fighter . In other words , he 's not Deng . But none of the other members of China 's collective leadership are either . Today 's top Politburo members are bureaucrats and engineers . In Soviet terms , Jiang would not even be Nikita Khrushchev ; rather , he 's more like Leonid Brezhnev . The others are no different , and that works in two ways . They may have no more claim to greatness than Jiang , but now that Deng is gone they can easily go after their present leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , " says Kenneth Lieberthal of the University of Michigan , " they could n't do a frontal assault on Jiang .
