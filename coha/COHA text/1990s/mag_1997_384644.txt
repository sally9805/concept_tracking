MAUI NO KA OI . You need n't be an akamai ( in the know ) resident to make the translation : Maui is the best . For years the reference applied to the Valley Isle 's stunning beauty , which even by Hawaiian standards is surpassing . But now its golf has met the measure of its ocean-kissed beaches and awesome Haleakala ( " House of the Sun " ) Crater . In fact , the 1990s have witnessed the opening of the island 's top courses , so that now this most glamorous of getaways can back up its braggadocio : For superb golf in an exquisite array of settings , Maui no ka oi . Maui is actually two islands in one , with a dozen microclimates between them . The island began as a pair of bubbling volcanos that fused eons ago . A fertile isthmus joins the two land masses . The weather can be wet and windy in the west , especially in the winter , but is invariably dry and sunny in the east . West Maui 's star property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pineapple plantation backdropped by fuzzy green sawtooth peaks . Kapalua 's Bay and Village courses are a Jekyll-and-Hyde duo : One has seaside thrills , the other is an upland journey into the mountains . The Plantation Course is Maui 's reigning heavyweight , a brilliant 7,263-yard design by Ben Crenshaw-Bill Coore marked by enormous greens , unusual blind shots , and several perilous drops . The 550room Ritz-Carlton Kapalua , terraced into a hillside among century-old Cook pines , has emerged as one of Hawaii 's finest resort hotels since opening in 1992 . A few miles south of Kapalua is KULl , a 500-acre resort complex set between sugarcane fields and the sea . Developed in the late 1950s , Kaanapali pioneered the concept of a master-planned destination . Set back from a three-mile-long beach are six hotels , a smattering of condos , and Kaanapali 's North and South courses . The North , site of the Hyatt Regency Maui Kaanapali Classic , a Senior PGA Tour event , opens tamely at sea level before climbing into mountain foothills . Topsy-turvy greens , water hazards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par-71 South Course is a pleasant warm-up track . East Maui , the larger half of the island , is dominated by massive Haleakala Crater , a 10,023-foot dormant volcano with a broken cone for a summit . On its western flank is WAILEA , a 1,500-acre resort that celebrates its 25th anniversary this month . Golf-wise , the only holdover from the original development is the Blue Course , an agreeable layout with wide fairways and gentle inclines . With a $65 green fee after 3 p.m. ( through March ) , it 's one of the best in-season deals on Maui . Wailea 's newer Gold and Emerald courses , both by Robert Trent Jones Jr . and both featured among GOLF MAGAZINE 'S " Top 10 You Can Play " ( in 1994 and 1995 , respectively ) , are exceptionally attractive . The 7,070-yard Gold is a player 's track with minimalist decor-native grasses , exposed lava , and papohaku ( ancient stone walls ) framing the course . The Emerald , shorter and gentler , is a near-perfect resort layout that feels like a lush tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , players can drop by SeaWatch Restaurant at Wailea , which offers some of the most imaginative dishes in the state . Accommodations are available at several nearby hotels , including the well-appointed Four Seasons Resort Maui . Photograph Perched above the Pacific , Wailea 's Emerald Course is worth crossing an ocean to play . // A few miles from Wailea is the 1,800-acre MAMI-ARE , its lodging centerpiece the A-shaped Maui Prince Hotel . In 1993 , the resort 's existing 18-hole course was divided , with each nine combined with new nines by Robert Trent Jones Jr . to create the North and South courses . The South , which swings near the sea , retains the signature par-four 16th from the original design , a sprawling dogleg that parallels the sea and leads to an elevated , undulating green . The tougher North climbs the foothills of Haleakala to higher elevations , the holes routed among gaping ravines , wind-stunted kiawe trees , and strategic water features . Sunshine and gentle breezes are a given here-Haleakala 's bulk shields the region from rain and wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
