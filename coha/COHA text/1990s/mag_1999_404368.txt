On Arbor Day , " Miss Lewis said , " we shall have a surprise school picnic . " That made Arbor Day hard to wait for . The fifth grade always had the best surprises in the school . But on the morning of Arbor Day , when they all met in the schoolroom , there was no sign of the picnic-no jugs of lemonade , not even a basket . When everyone was in his seat , Miss Lewis explained , " This is a real Arbor Day picnic . The trees know the secret of where the picnic is to be and we can only find out about it from them . How many of you know the name of the tree on which these leaves grow ? " Miss Lewis held out a spray of leaves and they all looked at them . As no one answered , she separated one of the leaves and held it out . " Perhaps you can tell better by looking at just one leaf . " " It 's lopsided , " Billy said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Rose excitedly . " It 's a white elm . We have a pressed leaf at home just like it that Mother picked up under the Washington Elm at Cambridge . It was under that tree that Washington took command of the American army " Yes it is , " said Miss Lewis . " Now we 'll follow where the white elms lead until we come to a tree with leaves like this . " Miss Lewis held up another leaf . " I think that 's a tulip tree leaf , " said Clark and they all laughed at him for not knowing that tulips were flowers . But Miss Lewis said that he was right . " That 's as much as we need to know to start , " she added . So they all trooped out of the school door . It was easy to find the way to start , for the white elm trees began right outside the school door and led away on both sides of the walk , forming a green arch above them . Some of the children raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Miss Lewis , now and then pulling a few leaves from the white elms as they went along . Presently they reached a corner and found the ones who had gone on ahead , waiting in doubt , for the white elms led away in each direction . " Why in the world do they have so many white elms ? " Ernest asked . Miss Lewis explained that the white elm was one of the most valuable trees . " It is very beautiful ; the wood can be used for a great many purposes , and the tree will grow in almost any part of America , " she said . But where was the tulip tree ? All of the children were sure that it should be found easily because of the odd shape of the leaves . But so far as they could see , the green archway of white elms continued . " Let 's divide in groups , " Fred proposed . " Then we can explore in each direction , and as soon as one of us finds the tulip tree , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . " // Quickly they separated and set off . Clark 's group proved to be the lucky one . Before the others had gone a block , they heard them shouting . The tulip tree had been found right in the corner of Anne 's yard and everyone laughed at her for not knowing the trees in her own yard . " But I do know it , " Anne said . " In autumn it has the prettiest pure yellow leaves of any on the street . And if you joggle the branches , the seeds go whirring off like flocks of little brown fairy birds flying . I just did n't know its name . Tied to the trunk of the tulip tree was a branch from another tree . " It 's some kind of oak leaf , " Jim said . Miss Lewis said that he was right , that the leaf was from a white oak tree . " It has very valuable wood , too . " " I know where it grows , " said Rose positively , " right by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering acorns from it in the fall . " But when they reached the tree , the leaves were not the same . Miss Lewis looked carefully at the leaf they pulled from the tree and said that the tree was a pin oak . " I think there 's an oak down by the bandstand , " Christopher said . But at the bandstand they were disappointed again . This tree , Miss Lewis said , was a red oak and she told them to look carefully at the leaf and remember that it was one of the prettiest oaks and that it grew more rapidly than any other oak . " In the first year , " she exclaimed , " it has been known to grow nineteen inches . It is the one to plant if you are eager to have an oak tree as soon as possible . In ten years it will be about eighteen feet high . " " I believe there is another oak tree across the street , " Anne exclaimed . But when they reached it , though the leaves were somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Miss Lewis said that the tree was a bur oak and that from such trees came the pretty quarter-sawed oak that was used for desks and other furniture . " Let 's go back to the tulip tree , " Christopher said , " and start looking for the white oak from there . " As they went along he added , " We must have learned almost all the different kinds of oak leaves by this time . " But Miss Lewis said no and told them that there were more than three hundred different kinds of oak trees . " These are only the more common ones that we have found this morning , " she said . " Why , here it is ! " cried Clark suddenly , and there right flat on the sidewalk before them lay a white oak leaf . It was a perfect match for the one they had been carrying with them . They looked up overhead and saw tied to the trunk of the white oak tree another branch of leaves . " I know that pretty star-shaped leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our yard by the bird bath . " " Do you know its name ? " Miss Lewis asked . As Ernest shook his head , she explained that the tree was the sweet gum . Tied to the branch of the sweet gum they found another branch of leaves and Miss Lewis said , " Now let 's not make any more blunders such as we made about the oak trees , for the tree to which this leaf belongs also has many close relatives . Does any one know what family it is ? " " Is there a maple family ? " asked Fred who had been looking closely at the leaf . " There is , " replied Miss Lewis , " and this is one of the seventy members of it . And it is n't an ash maple or , as it is sometimes called , a box elder . That has three and sometimes five leaflets shaped like this . " Miss Lewis sketched an outline . " And it is n't a red maple . That has bright red twigs and a leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple . That has leaves green on top and silvery white on the bottom and shaped like this . " " It is a sugar maple leaf ! " cried Christopher . " I know where there 's a whole grove of them . We buy maple syrup from the man who owns them . " Christopher led the way and they all followed . When they reached the grove , they found the picnic all spread out on the tables of the sugar camp . All the mothers and fathers were there , too , waiting to have the picnic with them . By each place was a little paper book with a pencil for tracing the outlines of leaves they collected and a place to write the name of the tree and its family and anything they might learn about its habits . Clark made them all laugh . Peeping inside his sandwich he said : " I think I 'll start with a lettuce leaf " // <p>
