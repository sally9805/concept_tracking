<p> A learning vacation is the only way Eugene Rowe will travel these days . <p> " After years of standard tourist vacations , I was getting bored , " he says . " What I needed was focus , not five-star hotels . I also wanted more for the money I was spending to see the world . Now that I vacation to learn , I get lots of bang and pizazz out of my travel dollar . " <p> Mr. Rowe is part of a new wave driven by the yearn to learn , an outlook that experts say is shaping up as one of the biggest travel trends of the 1990s . <p> Such vacationers pursue not only fun , but also knowledge and understanding of an area 's culture and habitat . <p> During scientific field-research expeditions sponsored by Earthwatch , Mr. Rowe has helped scientists study lake pollution in Siberia and Kenya , track baboons in Ethiopia , monitor lobsters in the Florida Keys , explore shipwrecks off Bermuda and count parrot fish in the Canary Islands . Since 1984 , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28,000 volunteers such as Mr. Rowe have participated in Earthwatch projects in 87 countries and 36 states . The non-profit company is based in Watertown , Mass. , near Boston . <p> " We 're not treated like kings , " says Mr. Rowe , a semiretired veterinarian who lives in Highland Springs , Va . " We work eight hours a day . It can be tiring but , for me , never dull . Nothing compares with the experience . " <p> Earthwatchers live simply but comfortably in tents , bunkhouses , college dorms and occasionally charming old hotels . To participate , you need n't be a scholar to fall under the tutelage of a scientist , but you should be in good health . And age is no barrier to participation : Some volunteers are in their 80s . <p> Enrichment travel takes many forms , satisfying both the adventurous and the sedentary vacationer . Some people choose to challenge their physical skills by trekking in the wilderness ; others attend university classes at faraway campuses . Some cruise the Greek islands to learn about ancient history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care in Africa , Indian mounds in Missouri , rain forests in Brazil , regional cuisine in Italy and photography in India . <p> Universities , museums and such specialized travel organizers as Elderhostel , Earthwatch and Outward Bound offer numerous study trips and expeditions . Adventure tour operators attract many who want to broaden their horizons . <p> For some , the first travel-learn experience is a university- sponsored trip . Robert Pomaville , an investigator of industrial accidents in Fresno , Calif. , raves about his first " egghead " vacation . He and his wife , Katherine , celebrated their 30th anniversary by taking a two-week study trip to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador . <p> " Let 's put it this way : I 've always learned something on a vacation , but never on purpose , " he says . " The trip was phenomenal . We explored the islands with naturalists and actually snorkeled among sea lions that played with us like puppies . " <p> More than just an adventure , the trip also was a learning experience . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pomaville says . " Each night back on ship , he lectured on geography and history . If he had given exams , all 17 of us would have gotten As . His classes were fascinating . " <p> The Pomavilles ' excursion was organized by TraveLearn , a Pennsylvania company specializing in setting up university-sponsored trips for non-acedemic travelers . <p> Most TraveLearn trips are to non-Western nations , often in Kenya , Egypt , Nepal and Morocco . Within a country , such as the former Soviet Union or China , TraveLearn has excursions for various interests . Professors are tour leaders ; accommodations are the best available . <p> Enrichment travel will continue to grow because Americans are attuned to the idea of lifelong learning , says Ed Willians , founder of TraveLearn . He 's an education professor at Kean College in New Jersey . <p> A pioneer in continuing education for Elderhostel , which offers study programs at 1,600 locations in the United States , Canada and 43 other countries . Many programs are on college campuses , taking advantage of classrooms and dormitories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For $ 270 , for example , you can attend three classes a day and get six nights ' lodging and board . You do n't need a high school diploma to be an Elderhoster , but you must be at least 60 . <p> " Elderhostel attracts dynamic people , " says Cady Ann Goldfield , who works at Elderhostel 's Boston headquarters . " They 're not the type to sit on the porch and rock . " <p> Ginna Gauss , an avid traveler and sculptor from Bailey 's Harbor , Wis. , went on her first Elderhostel trip last summer . She spent two weeks living in a chateau 50 miles southwest of Paris while studying the government of villages . <p> " Whenever I go , I try to learn as much as possible , but this was the only tim e I could really discuss what I was learning with people who shared my interests , " Ms. Gauss says . <p> Those who join museum-sponsored tours also are assured that fellow companions are like-minded . The most extensive are operated by the Smithsonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign study tours and seminars . <p> The costs are $ 180 to $ 250 per day for domestic trips ( transportation to tour sites is extra ) and about $ 250 per day abroad ( airfare included ) . They are considered very upscale ; the focus is on culture and natural history . Museum curators and scholars lead the trips . <p> If you try a Smithsonian learning adventure , you may retrace caravan routes of Soviet Central Asia , stroll through gardens of northern Italy or travel by boat on the Yangtze River in China . <p> Or you may stay closer to home , as George Rosser of Charlotte , N.C. , did , sharing time with fellow history enthusiasts at Antietam Battlefield in Maryland . " It 's fun being with other Civil War buffs and chatting about mutual friends - Abraham Lincoln , Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant , " he says . <p> Not all learning vacations are as upscale as the Smithsonian 's , but those sponsored by Outward Bound can mean " scaling-up . " <p> Outward Bound operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing . Other challenges may be rafting , backpacking in the desert , dog-sledding , cross-country skiing , coastal trekking or canoeing . <p> The organization , founded in England in 1942 , has its U.S. headquarters in Greenwich , Conn. , with a Southern branch in North Carolina . About 30,000 Americans have participated in Outward Bound 's 600 annual courses . <p> You need n't be an athlete or know how to ride a horse , paddle a canoe , go sailing or climb a mountain to participate . But you must be willing to try . Although these vacations focus on wilderness skills , what makes a difference in participants ' lives is learning teamwork and building self-confidence by conquering fears . <p> Not long ago , Debra Jordan , a nurse in Jacksonville , Fla. , chose to trade the city streets and high-stress life of the hospital for a nine- day intensive Outward Bound course in the North Carolina mountains . <p> " We backpacked for miles , walked across a log 40 feet above the ground , crossed a rope bridge , rappelled down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought I was in boot camp . But I accomplished things I never thought possible . It was super for my self-esteem . " <p> Philosopher Francis Bacon once said : " There are as many reasons people travel as there are travelers . Some enjoy exploring the unknown , others like plunging into their special interests . Most delight in the company of kindred spirits . " <p> On a learning vacation , you are among " kinfolk . " <p> Freelance writer Joy Lewis lives in Minneapolis .
