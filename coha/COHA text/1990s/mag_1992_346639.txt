Multiple-choice test for global strategists : if Western military forces intervened in Bosnia , they would face a situation most like a ) the Vietnam War , b ) Desert Storm , c ) Northern Ireland , d ) none of the above . Since history rarely repeats itself exactly , the most likely answer is d . But there are enough points of similarity to a and c  --  and of dissimilarity to b  --  to give pause to the U.S. and Europe . <P> Western leaders are moving steadily closer to going ahead anyway . Public revulsion at the killing shown on television and a sense of impotence in the supposed new world order are beginning to build pressure in Washington , London , Paris and Bonn to do something . Economic sanctions against Serbia promise no quick solution . Even the airlift of supplies into Sarajevo that began last week seems likely only to stave off starvation . <P> But successful intervention requires strong leadership that sets clear and achievable political objectives and assembles sufficient forces  --  conditions met in Desert Storm but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants the European nations to take the lead . They have been just as conspicuously unwilling . Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney last week said American planes would supply air cover and support to an international expedition , but insisted that under no circumstances would American troops be sent into ground combat in what he calls " an internal civil war . " <P> To some allies this sounds like an invitation for their soldiers to do the dying . According to a senior French official , George Bush last week telephoned President Francois Mitterrand to try out an idea for joint air strikes against Serbian positions around Sarajevo and along the road to Split , the Adriatic port from which relief supplies might be sent overland . Mitterrand , says the official , refused because that might expose the 250 French soldiers flown into Sarajevo airport last week to Serbian reprisals . White House officials snort that Bush proposed no such thing . But the story illustrates the unwillingness of Europeans to commit ground troops unless American G.I.s share the risks . <P> In any case , how much force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends heavily on what political objectives the allies set . Even the minimum objective  --  securing the area around the airport so that relief flights can land safely  --  might require taking out Serbian gun positions and tanks in the surrounding hills . Guesses of the force needed range from 45,000 to 100,000 . French Colonel Jean-Louis Dufour , author of a book on the gulf war , thinks that it would take 75,000 troops grouped in three contingents , each including two tank regiments and two artillery regiments . <P> Some experts doubt that a full-scale airlift could bring in enough food to do more than help Sarajevo 's 400,000 residents survive . A genuine end to the - siege might require opening an overland corridor from Split . That would be a still more difficult task if relief convoys negotiating shell-pocked roads also had to shoot their way past Serbian roadblocks.
