<p> All across Washington , in doctors ' offices and people 's family rooms , in hideaways on Capitol Hill and think-tank conference rooms , the political diagnosis is sinking in : National health care reform legislation for this year is in terminal condition . <p> As the shock wave rolls through the health care community  --  for some , it 's a victory ; for others , a defeat  --  the discussion of how to fix the problems of the country 's patchwork health care system has shifted . Just last week , at George Washington University 's Intergovernmental Health Policy Project , director Richard Merritt asked his staff to do an about-face . Instead of analyzing medical trends in light of major health reform legislation , the researchers are now studying what will happen in the event of no reform or very modest legislation . <p> But just as it was said of the death of kings in times past , it can also be said of the current health care political debacle : <p> Reform is Dead  --  Long Live Reform . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steelman , former adviser to President Bush on Social Security and health care . <p> Steven A. Schroeder of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation agrees : " The access problem does n't get better . You still have the number of uninsured . You still have the insecurity of losing coverage . " <p> " You can run , but you ca n't hide , " adds Drew E. Altman , president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation . " We failed in an historic attempt to deal with health care reform in a sweeping way . Now we 'll deal with it in an incremental way . " <p> Over the few remaining weeks of this congressional session , Americans will be watching lawmakers to see if some small pieces of health legislation can be enacted from the wreckage of the Grand Plan that had been proposed by President Clinton and his standard bearers in Congress . <p> But whether reform legislation is possible this year or next  --  or does n't surface until the end of the decade  --  the following principles are likely to dominate the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of medical practice has become a badge of honor for those who are ready to bury health care legislation for this year . They believe that time has run out on crafting a solid bill . <p> Resistance on the basis of do-no-harm to even a modest plan comes from both the right and left of the political spectrum . Sen. Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) has attacked the so-called mainstream bipartisan proposal in the Senate as " more mainstream Washington " than " mainstream America . " GOP national chairman Haley Barbour has declared that it would be better to do nothing now than pass a last-minute compromise . To William Kristol , chairman of the Project for the Republican Future and former adviser to Vice President Dan Quayle , " the best of health-care Clintonism " dressed up as " innocuous incrementalism ... still deserves to die . " <p> Leaders on the left are just as adamant . Rep. Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) , who heads a group that favors a Canadian-style , " single-payer , " government-financed system , has argued for junking all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similar sentiments have been voiced by such ardent advocates of major reform as Rep. Fortney " Pete " Stark ( D-Calif. ) and Sen. Paul Wellstone ( D-Minn . ) <p> Policy analysts at Consumers Union , an advocacy group that favors national health insurance , have lambasted incremental plans for raising insurance premiums for many middle-class families and continuing to imprison poor families in what they call " poverty lock "  --  the situation in which people can not earn above a certain income or else they lose government benefits that help provide health coverage . As Consumers Union 's legislative counsel Robert Carolla says : " If you ca n't do it right , I do n't know whether it 's worth it . " <p> Behind the medical principle of " first , do no harm " is the realization that many illnesses such as the common cold take care of themselves without major intervention by physicians . Some reform critics argue that the same is true of the health care system . They point out that with the dramatic changes that have occurred in the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of itself . <p> The changes go by the name of " managed care . " In this type of care , people belong to health maintenance organizations or plans with a specific network of medical facilities . Their treatments are monitored , and their choices of physician and hospital may be limited . The shift to managed care has resulted in a shakedown of the medical industry , with some hospitals closing or merging with other facilities . Some high-priced specialists are finding it harder to fill their appointment books or are being forced to take smaller fees , while nurses in many hospitals are facing cutbacks . <p> Just as the debate over national health reform heated up , the rapid rise in medical costs slowed . What 's more , once the economy started to grow again , fewer people feared that they would lose their jobs  --  and thus their health insurance . <p> The urgency for legislation stalled , and lawmakers have not come back from their August recess with a mandate for action . " The people I 've talked to said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Democrat Stark . <p> Nevertheless , the medical principle of do-no-harm does not always mean do nothing for a patient , even when signs and symptoms of illness seem faint . In fact , doing nothing can be fatal , as proponents of reform are quick to point out . <p> " The vacuum created by Congress is going to be filled by an entrepreneurism that is more interested in profits than patients , " says James S. Todd , executive vice president of the American Medical Association . " With the consolidation of the marketplace , with the giant insurance companies taking over , patients suddenly become pawns in this great competitive health care system . " <p> Without any legislation , the consensus is that the burden will continue to fall on the chronically ill , the uninsured and those with inadequate coverage  --  and the hospitals and doctors who treat them . Fewer people will get insurance through their jobs . The percentage of those under 65 who have job-based coverage has already dropped from 65.4 percent in 1989 to 62.5 percent in 1992 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute ( EBRI ) . People without insurance will find it harder to get " free " care from private facilities . Hospital emergency rooms will continue to see patients who have put off treatment until a crisis arises . <p> " The only way to make a health system work is to have the greatest number of people in it , " Todd continues . " If you do n't approach universal coverage , you have cost shifting , uncompensated care and delayed care . " <p> A Small Step for Congress , a Giant Leap for Americans . Under this scenario , even a modest proposal is significant . As Altman says : " Incremental does not mean unimportant . " <p> Circulating in these last weeks of Congress are a number of proposals for a scaled-down bipartisan bill . Foremost is the Senate measure put together by the " mainstream coalition " headed by Sen. John Chafee ( R-R.I. ) working with such senators as John Breaux ( D-La . ) , Dave Durenberger ( R-Minn. ) and Kent Conrad ( D-N.D . ) . <p> Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health insurance to make it easier for individuals and small businesses to obtain coverage at reasonable prices . It would also provide federal subsidies each year to help low-income people to buy private health insurance policies . Depending on the funding , a bill of this type might eventually provide coverage for 15 million to 20 million people  --  about half of those who now lack coverage . <p> If insurance reforms were enacted , people could not be refused coverage because of their health status or age . They could carry their coverage from job to job . Variations in the price of premiums based on health status would be eliminated and variations based on age sharply reduced . Insurers ' ability to deny care for a " preexisting condition "  --  insurance parlance for having a health problem such as diabetes or cancer  --  would be limited to six months after a person obtained insurance for the first time or after a long period without insurance . <p> " It is , in fact , a good beginning , " says physician David Satcher , the director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the White House task force on health care reform and is a former president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville . " It would not allow insurance companies to drop people . It would provide subsidies . It would not get to universal access , but it would get more people in the system . Anything that begins to put us in the right direction would be better than nothing . " <p> Another approach is to design a kids-first program for people under 18 . Medicaid requires states to cover many low-income children but not all . Among the proposals being readied for Congress is a limited program to expand subsidies to all children in families whose incomes are under 200 percent of the poverty line  --  about $ 30,000 a year for a family of four . Proponents expect that it would cover an additional 3.5 million children , " It extends the safety net . You can do it inexpensively , " says EBRI 's Custer . <p> Some versions are more ambitious , seeking a new program that would cover all children in families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest enemy of incremental legislation in this Congress is the clock . " The language of a bill is important because of unintended effects , " says health care analyst Gail R. Wilensky , who headed the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the Bush administration . " If incremental reform includes major subsidies , where is the money coming from ? Until we make some fundamental decisions , it 's silly talk . " <p> Many lawmakers also remember the bruising experience in 1988 of passing a so-called modest bill providing coverage of catastrophic medical expenses for the elderly  --  only to have it ignominiously repealed after many beneficiaries raised strong protests about the cost . " If you do something small and it blows up in your face , it 's catastrophic revisited , " says reform advocate Rep. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , a political lesson lodged " up front in the cranial lobes . " <p> At the same time , even if the incremental approach fails in this Congress , it may gain credence in the next sessions of Congress . Depending on the makeup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House  --  lawmakers may deliberately seek to enact health care reform legislation , piece by piece , rather than tackle a whole gigantic plan at one time . <p> As Steelman puts it : " Instead of a whole meal , the Senate Labor Committee will do vegetables , the Senate Finance Committee mashed potatoes . It will make life hell for people on the outside . " <p> The result , incrementalists argue , would be that piecemeal legislation over several years could achieve many of the same goals as the Clinton Grand Plan . Take the concept of a federal program for children . Rather than a token , points out Altman , " universal coverage for children would represent the most significant health legislation since Medicare . " <p> But the major losers of a go-slow approach are the 38.5 million Americans who currently lack insurance and many of the chronically ill who already have trouble getting adequate care and suffer severe financial losses due to uncovered medical expenses . <p> On the Road Again . As health reform founders in Washington , legislative action hits the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental programs are underway . <p> Most states put their initiatives on hold when President Clinton made enactment of a national plan a priority of his presidency . Now the green light is blinking for the states , and the administration has signaled its willingness to support state plans . <p> Almost all states have started with reforms of the insurance marketplace to make it easier for small businesses and individuals to purchase coverage . A dozen states are trying out some form of health alliance  --  a kind of health insurance buying club for people to get better prices for policies . <p> Florida , Tennessee , Hawaii and Oregon all have federal permission to design very different state programs for their Medicaid and uninsured populations . Hawaii already requires employers to provide coverage for their workers . <p> In California , residents will vote on whether to take steps toward a state-wide , government-run " single-payer " system similar to national health programs in Canada and Europe . <p> " If we can have six to eight states developing their own models of how to provide universal coverage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canada or Great Britain on how to design our own system , " says Merritt of George Washington University 's Intergovernmental Health Policy Project , which recently published a report profiling health reform changes in all 50 states . <p> Four states  --  New York , New Jersey , Vermont and Maine  --  now require insurers to offer coverage at the same price to all individuals and small firms within a given area , using the insurance technique known as community rating . With the exception of New York , the insurance reforms were phased in over several years . " That 's the way to go , " says Kala Ladenheim , one of the George Washington University report 's authors . " You do n't want to drop off the cliff . " <p> In New York , where the new system for selling insurance went into effect in April 1993 , the results have been mixed . Some younger people tended to drop their individual policies because they suffered sharp premium increases when their plans enrolled sick and older people who had been excluded before . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A major obstacle is a 1974 federal law called ERISA that exempts firms that insure themselves from state regulations . Virtually all large companies and many smaller firms with 100 or more employees take this route and can therefore opt out of any state reform program . <p> State experimentation also creates a futuristic scenario of 50 separate health-care kingdoms , with conflicting rules and practices . The prospect engenders strong opposition from large national corporations , unions and many in the health care community . " I do n't think anybody is enthusiastic about the Balkanization of health care in this country , " says Steelman . <p> " Whatever the states do , it will not be uniform enough , " adds Custer . " Eventually , members of Congress are going to have to address this on a federal level . There is a great deal of burnout at this particular moment , but the problems that brought us to this debate will not go away . " <p> Meanwhile , the health policy crusaders who came to Washington to enact sweeping legislation are licking their wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , it 's going to be vitally important that our political leaders be more forthright about how much it will cost , " says Altman of the Kaiser foundation . " How can you pay for health reform in a **28;295;TOOLONG environment ? The answer is you ca n't . " <p> In Altman 's view , the public is grappling with two monsters in health care reform : The first is " Big Government . " The second is the medical marketplace as the trends toward managed care roll across the country . This time around , the public has " been preoccupied with the wrong monster , the government monster , " says Altman . The next time , the public may turn to the marketplace monster . <p> " I think we were ahead of the times , " says psychiatrist Sue Bailey , deputy assistant secretary of defense , who has campaigned for a Clinton-style health care plan for the Democratic Party . " Until the problem hits home , it 's hard to convince the nation to make changes of this magnitude . Unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , you do n't know if you 're well covered or not . <p> " But in the future , when people do have a problem in their family , they 'll remember  --  who tried ? Who put the issue on the table ? Bill Clinton . I still think it can be used to our political advantage . "
