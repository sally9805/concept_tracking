Sweat dampening the wrinkled sheet beneath him , Joshua Duff counted the spurts of AK-47 bullets hitting the front door.The first round slipped into his nightmare  --  house check on a nameless street in Kabul . A search for insurgents . Dread crawled through him like a snake , twining around his neck , suffocating him as he crept forward in the heat . Faces stared at him , brown eyes luminous beneath long , fringed black lashes . Mouths smiled , lips parting over missing teeth . Hands reached out , fingers extended . <p> Friend ? Or enemy ? <p> The second round of staccato hammering woke Joshua from the troubled dream.The strangled breaths were his own.Jerking upright , he reached for a gun that was n't there . The smell of gym shoes , basketballs , dusty concrete caught in his nostrils.This was not his barracks . <p> Or was it ? <p> His eyes searched the darkness . Confusion tore through his brain as he worked to decipher data . A form lay on a bed across from him . The mound of muscled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the door . <p> Comrade or civilian ? <p> Asleep or dead ? <p> A single window filled the only visible wall . <p> Somewhere nearby , an animal snuffled . <p> Death still stalking him , perspiration beading his bare chest , Joshua gripped the rounded aluminum frame of his cot . He licked his lips , expecting grit . Its absence surprised him . The tendon in his jaw flickered as he tried to force reality into his brain . <p> Of all the adversaries he 'd faced in his thirty years , this was the most wily.This doubt and hesitation , this inability to decode the truth , eluded him like aTaliban sniper in the Hindu Kush Mountains.He tensed , waiting for an imam 's voice to drift from a distant minaret , the morning melody of Islam.The start of another day . <p> The hammering rang out a third time . Not a machine gun , it was fist against metal . <p> " Devil take ' em . " Sam Hawke 's familiar voice was drowsy in the stifling room . Hawke was a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many times to count . <p> The other man unfolded now , a hiss groaning through the air mattress beneath him . " Where 's Duke ? Come here , boy . " <p> A German shepherd 's low-throated growl answered . Joshua recognized it . He had seen the dog before . But where ? Toenails clicked across the cement floor as Duke paced . The edges of Joshua 's nightmare began to sift away like desert sand . <p> " I 'll get the door , " Sam said , rising . He glanced at Joshua . " Duff , you stay put . Let 's go , Terell . " <p> Terell Roberts  --  the third man 's name . He stood and stretched . His dark skin shimmered with perspiration . <p> Duke tensed , waiting for one of them to open the door . The dog anticipated each movement the men made . He knew this routine . <p> Sam flipped on a lamp and Joshua scanned the room , distinguishing a heap of jeans and T-shirts awaiting detergent and a dryer . He noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam had planned for the coming day . Joshua recalled his friend handing it to him , explaining what he 'd written  --  basketball practice , homework and tutoring , woodworking , computer skills , ballet lessons , crochet , arts and crafts . <p> Hardly the business of their Marine Corps reconnaissance unit . <p> He spotted his wallet and keys on a low table . That wallet held U.S. tens , twenties , fifties . More than a month had passed since he 'd carried colorful paper afghanis with their detailed etchings of mosques , and handfuls of jingling puls in his uniform pockets . He had rented a civilian car at the airport . He recalled parking the black Cadillac near the building 's front door the evening before . <p> This was what they called post-combat disorder . Post-traumatic stress syndrome <p> A fourth round of hammering broke his focus . <p> " Persistent booger , " Sam muttered . <p> Shaking off his confusion , Joshua got to his feet . " What 's up , Hawke ? " <p> " Nothing.We get this every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , another fix bang on Haven 's door . Some think it says Heaven . " <p> " Yeah , and they 're ready . " Terell chuckled ruefully as he stepped into a pair of flip-flops . <p> Joshua recalled the old building now . Haven , the sign over the entrance read.This was Sam Hawke 's place , the youth center he and Terell Roberts had opened about a year ago . While deployed together , Sam had told Joshua about playing basketball in college . He had spoken of Terell , the consummate athlete , destined for the history books . Last night , Joshua learned that Terell had spent a few years in the pros before bottoming out . <p> Sam had come to his rescue , and with the last of Terell 's NBA savings , they had started Haven . <p> Sam Hawke was loyal , a man who never forgot a friend . Joshua had n't been home in Amarillo for a full day before Sam called and invited his friend to St. Louis . <p> " Come see what I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your old man is planning to slip those velvet handcuffs around your wrists any day now . Get over here and pay me a visit while you can . " <p> The idea of spending time at a youth center in the run-down inner city did n't appeal to Joshua . He had invested more than enough of himself in the poverty and danger of Afghanistan . His parents ' rambling adobe house with its swimming pool and tennis court looked pretty good . He would enjoy riding out on one of the Arabians his father bred.There would be dinners with friends and family , flying over the spread in the Cessna , heading into town for a <p> Come to think of it , Joshua could n't figure out what he 'd want to do in Amarillo . The ranch certainly was n't going anywhere . His father 's oil business and the executive position could wait , too.With his parents both protesting , he had grabbed his duffel bag and headed back to the airport . <p> In St. Louis , he had rented the Cadillac.Then he drove into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Haven , he , Sam andTerell had stayed up talking for hours.When his head hit the pillow , Joshua had expected to sleep at least until the sun came up . But it seemed the two directors of the youth center were accustomed to regular interruptions of their night 's rest . <p> " Armed ? " Sam asked Terell as they stood in the half-light of the large room . <p> Expecting the men to reach for handguns , Joshua was surprised when Terell picked up a can of pepper spray . Defensive weapon . Strange choice , he thought . <p> Sam reached for a box he kept under his bed . He offered it to his friend . <p> Gleaming steel knives . Joshua glanced up in confusion . Sam and he were both expert marksmen . <p> " We keep a low profile around here , " Sam said with a shrug . <p> Fingers closing around a slender stiletto , razor sharp , Joshua considered his friend 's arsenal . A knife was an offensive weapon . That fit with what he knew of Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much alike . <p> The German shepherd led the way out of the humid room , across a dank landing to a flight of chipped concrete steps . <p> " Male , " Terell said as they began the descent . <p> " Agreed . " Sam 's voice was husky . " White . " <p> " Nah , black . A kid . Scared . " <p> Joshua realized this must be a nightly guessing game . <p> " Middle-aged , " Sam offered . " Drunk . " <p> " Bleeding . " <p> " Probably . " Sam picked up a first-aid kit near the stairwell . " Knife wound . " <p> " Gunshot . " <p> None of it sounded good to Joshua . <p> The three men crossed the cavernous gym , the site of Haven 's single basketball court , two foursquare layouts , and just enough room for a gaggle of jump-ropers . Duke huffed with anticipation as he padded ahead.Yet another round of knocking began as they arrived at the front door . <p> " Whatcha need ? " Terell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> At the pleading voice outside , Sam and Terell looked at each other , blue eyes meeting brown . <p> " Illegal alien , " Sam said . " Adult male . Lost . " <p> " Bet he got kicked out of his apartment , " Terell muttered , reaching for the bar that secured the door . <p> Joshua weighed the stiletto in his palm . Earlier that evening , Sam had told him that African-American kids were a consistent majority at Haven . Latin Americans were part of the mix , too  --  most poor , persecuted , living on the brink . Unable to obtain visas or achieve refugee status , their parents had spent all they had and risked their lives to enter the U.S. illegally . <p> But the composition of the neighborhood had begun to change in recent months . Charitable foundations were resettling refugees by the score in St. Louis.An influx of immigrants from Burma , Somalia , Sudan , Congo , Bosnia and other war-torn countries led to new youngsters stepping timidly through the metal detector at Haven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to take a " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy regarding legal documentation , they told Joshua . Haven was about the business of God 's work . And the Lord had laid out a clear mandate for His people to welcome the alien . <p> " You ready ? " Sam asked , flicking a glance at Joshua . <p> He gave a brief nod as he sized up Terell.Tall and massively built , the man held up his slender can of pepper spray while Sam lifted the bar and drew back the bolt . <p> At the slide and click of metal against metal , wisps of Joshua 's nightmare floated across his mind . He gritted his teeth . The door swung open . <p> Liz Wallace turned a page in her scrapbook and ran a fingertip over the photograph of her parents waving goodbye at St. Louis 's Lambert Airport . They had no clue that within three days , their precious child would be sitting down to a meal of roasted bush rat . <p> In fact , they never found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that read , Hi Mom and Dad . Ate monkey meat and fried termites for dinner today . <p> This was not the kind of thing that would boost their enthusiasm for Liz 's dreams of becoming a foreign aid worker . Of course , her brief trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo had n't exactly been about transforming the plight of a Third World nation . She and her college teammates went to help rebuild a primary school that had been hit too many times by mortar fire.They put up a few walls and hurried home . <p> But that trip , more than a year before , had changed Liz 's life . The moment she graduated from college , she took a job with Refugee Hope , a resettlement agency in St. Louis . Her goal : to learn Swahili , enter a training program and move to Africa to work for the United Nations in refugee camps . <p> On this stifling night , unable to sleep after long hours toting supplies to incoming families from Burma and Bosnia , Liz could n't sleep . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly stand up . But after arriving home to her studio apartment , eating a quick bite of dinner and checking her schedule for the next day , she felt her second wind kick in . Wide-awake and unable to turn off her brain by 2:00 a.m. , she made a cup of decaf tea and settled on her sofa with the scrapbook . <p> Liz turned the page and studied the faces gazing back at her , impassive and worn . She had briefly considered decorating the page in the colors of the Congo flag and placing stickers of wild animals here and there . But why distract from the beauty of the Congolese people with their buttery chocolate skin and deep eyes ? <p> Yet what suffering the people had endured . Until that trip , Liz had never heard of such horrors . She understood now that Rwanda 's civil war had sent nearly a million refugees pouring over the border into Congolese camps . When those refugees began to build power to retake their homeland , they enlisted the help of men in Congo 's government.That brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1996 , complete with genocide , looting and genital mutilation . In some areas , soldiers raped more than half the women . Almost fifty thousand children were kidnapped and forced into combat , slave labor , sexual servitude . <p> Not long after a cease-fire was signed in 1999 , insurgent groups led a second uprising . Yet another peace treaty was signed in 2003 . By the time Liz arrived in Kinshasa , more than four million people had died . Some were killed in the conflict , but most perished from disease and starvation . <p> Three million were homeless . Houses , hospitals and schools lay in rubble . Fields and food supplies were burned . People hovered on the brink of starvation . <p> Under the umbrella organization of Refugee Hope , Liz cared for many of those woeful survivors who arrived in St. Louis . She was n't doing much to help , though . Her job was mostly desk work . Filing government forms . <p> She wondered if anyone could prevent genocide . Probably not . <p> Four sets of dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a man , a woman , two children , a plea for help written on earnest faces.Their innocence could belie a body strapped with explosives . In battle , Joshua had learned not to trust any expression of virtue . But this was n't warfare  --  not the combat kind , anyway . <p> With a tired smile , Sam stepped into the open doorway of Haven . " Hey , there , " he greeted them . " What can we do for you tonight ? " <p> The man gave an awkward little bow . Skin of polished ebony glowed in the streetlight . His gray shirt was too big , made of cotton , short-sleeved and wrinkled . Khaki trousers sagged at the ankles . Shoes , cracked patent leather with frayed laces , had parted at the seams to reveal threadbare socks . <p> " Good evening , sir , " he said , clutching a battered suitcase . A faint British accent , Joshua noticed . " I am Stephen Rudi . If you please , may I present my wife , Mary . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virtue.We come from Paganda . " <p> " What are you folks doing on the street at this time of night ? " Sam asked . " This is a dangerous area . " <p> " Yeah , and it 's after two in the morning . " Terell was peering at his Rolex , evidently a vestige of his once-lucrative basketball career . " Mr. Rudi , your children ought to be in bed . " <p> " Indeed , sir . But we have had a most unfortunate day . Please , may I explain ? You see , we had recently arrived in Atlanta when we received a letter from my wife 's brother.This man is our only family member to escape the recent unrest in Paganda . He invited us to join him here , where we could live with him and find better jobs . We traveled to St. Louis by bus , arriving this morning . But we searched all day , and we could not find him . " <p> " Aha . " Terell stifled a yawn . " So , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paganda , sir . It is in East Africa , near Lake Victoria . " <p> Joshua could see that neither Sam nor Terell recognized the country . He did n't recall much about it himself . Former British colony . Few natural resources.Tribal conflict  --  humanity 's constantly failing effort to eradicate enemies . Sunnis and Shiites . Kurds and Iraqis . Hindus and Muslims . Nazis and Jews . Spaniards and Aztecs . Settlers and Natives . Boers and British . <p> Extermination never worked , but people forgot that . Again and again they attempted the wholesale slaughter of their foes . Genocide would n't end until trumpets rang out in the eastern sky to announce the end of time . <p> " You still got that letter ? " Terell asked , focusing on the man 's wife . " Uhwhat was the name ? " <br> Continues ...
