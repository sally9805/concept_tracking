Section : the u.s. national observatories <p> The National Optical Astronomy Observatories are ground zero of the crisis in astronomy . Over the past 40 years , they have turned astronomy from a clubby oligarchy into a vibrant meritocracy . We must not allow slash-and-burn budgets to turn back the clock . <p> This is a period of rapid change for the National Optical Astronomy Observatories . WIYN , a new state-of-the-art telescope , has just begun operation at Kitt Peak in Arizona , and the construction of two 8-meter telescopes  --  the International Gemini Project  --  is proceeding toward a completion date of 2003 . At the same time , however , a shrinking budget is hampering attempts by NOAO to maintain its current complement of telescopes . These telescopes , located at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo in Chile , are relied upon by half of American optical and infrared astronomers as their only access to research facilities . <p> Whereas the scientific and technological advances of the ' 90s should be pushing NOAO forward , budgetary pressures and political infighting threaten to hold it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in Washington , D.C. They are respected astronomers from some of the nation 's top universities . <p> Prior to the late 1950s , all research telescopes in the United States were operated by private institutions . Access to these instruments was restricted to the astronomers who happened to work at those institutions . Although many other universities had their own observatories on or near campus , these local telescopes were usually small , poorly equipped , and poorly situated . Back then , many of the most important problems in astronomy could only be attacked using the few large telescopes , and so the handful of lucky astronomers who had access to those telescopes also had a monopoly on the science . <p> Many astronomers felt that this situation was intolerable . Following the creation of the National Science Foundation in the early 1950s , they formulated plans for an astronomical center that was to be supported by the government and available for all qualified observers . Their goal was realized in 1958 with the creation of the Kitt Peak National Observatory . Finally there was a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe . <p> Starting with a single 16-inch telescope , a city of domes sprouted on the mountaintop in southern Arizona . By the time of the completion of the 4-meter Mayall telescope in 1974 , Kitt Peak was the most important center for optical astronomy in the world see " Observing at Kitt Peak National Observatory , " July/August 1981 , p. 98 . At the same time , American astronomers realized the need for access to telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere , and they pushed for the creation of a second national observatory center : the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in the Chilean Andes . A Dual Agenda <p> In the 1980s , NOAO started to become a victim of its own success . The number of proposals far exceeded the number of available nights , and astronomers with good projects were not getting telescope time simply because there was n't enough to go around . Many astronomers looked for alternatives , the result being a large number of new telescopes built and operated by universities . In many cases , the same universities that had led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopes in order to have less dependence on NOAO . While they continued to support NOAO , many were now focusing their attention and resources on their own private facilities . <p> Optical astronomy moved into the 1990s with this dual agenda . The cracks in the national observatory model started to widen as federal belt-tightening squeezed NOAO 's budget and individual research grants . <p> The NOAO of the 1990s is a mix of old and new . The old is represented by the existing telescopes . Although still remarkably productive and very much in demand , these stalwart sentinels of the night are aging . Designed and built in the ' 50s and ' 60s , they fall short of modern instruments in terms of image quality . <p> The new NOAO shows its face in many ways . WIYN , a collaboration among the University of Wisconsin , Indiana University , Yale University , and NOAO , is a brand-new 3.5-meter reflector . Whereas older telescopes rarely produce stellar images sharper than 1 arcsecond , WIYN readily resolves objects half that size during periods of good seeing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine details to an extent never before possible from the ground . WIYN began regular operations in summer 1995 , and NOAO receives 40 percent of its time . <p> NOAO is also a leader in Gemini , a multinational effort to build a pair of 8-meter telescopes , one for each hemisphere . Gemini North will be on Mauna Kea in Hawaii , the premier observatory site in the Northern Hemisphere , and probably the world , because of its high altitude ( 4,200meters ) and clear skies see " Two Astronomical Centers of the World , " March/April 1989 , p. 34 . Gemini South will be built on Cerro Pachon , the mountain adjacent to Cerro Tololo . Construction is underway at both sites , and the two primary mirrors have already been fabricated at Corning Glass in N.Y . ( see photo on p. 11 ) . Gemini North should be operational by 2000 , and Gemini South the following years . American astronomers will get 45 percent of the time , with Britain , Canada , Chile , Brazil , Argentina , and the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap forward has been in its instruments and detectors . Futuristic instruments can take spectra of 100 objects simultaneously or image the sky through four different infrared filters at the same time . The instrumentation has allowed observers to get cutting-edge science out of even the smallest telescopes . <p> The National Solar Observatory , the third branch of NOAO , also has been investing in new facilities . In recent years , the solar observatory has been developing and deploying its Global Oscillations Network , a six-site helioseismic observing network that provides continuous monitoring of solar oscillations see " Sites Selected for Global Oscillation Network Group , " March/April 1991 , p. 85 . The GONG show went into full swing last year . A Brave New 10-Meter World <p> Of course , anyone who reads Mercury knows that NOAO is not the only American organization building new facilities see " A Thousand Points of Light , " p. 14 . The last decade has seen an unprecedented explosion in the number of telescopes built or planned for by private organizations : the two 10-meter Keck telescopes ( Caltech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Carnegie Institution , University of Arizona , and Harvard ) , the Hobby-Eberly 8-meter telescope ( University of Texas and Penn State ) , and the 8.5-meter Large Binocular Telescope ( University of Arizona ) . Yet this progress does not come without a cost . <p> Only astronomers associated with those institutions will have access to these telescopes . The rest will continue to rely on the national observatories . But will NOAO continue to be able to operate its current facilities ? Will open access become an endangered concept ? How will astronomy pay for operating these new facilities ? <p> In the past 10 years , the NOAO budget has shrunk 30 percent in real terms , and it is projected to drop another 16 percent by the year 2000 . Meanwhile , National Science Foundation grants , which support research by individual astronomers , have been unable to keep up with demand . Given the current and projected funding , some astronomers have suggested publicly that the national observatories should close many of their existing telescopes . These astronomers would prefer to have the NSF redirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on NOAO telescopes , this plan would stop their research dead in its tracks . <p> Two years ago , the NSF asked a committee of the National Research Council to figure out how it should support ground-based optical and infrared astronomy . The committee met with astronomers from around the country , looked into the details of observatory operations , and came up with a prioritized list of the facilities that NOAO should operate under gloomy funding scenarios . The inescapable conclusion : NOAO could not continue to operate all its telescopes ; significant changes would have to take place see Editorial , March/April 1995 , p. 2 . <p> The committee gave highest priority to Gemini , followed by the large telescopes at Cerro Tololo , and then the two largest telescopes at Kitt Peak . The smaller scopes would most likely have to go , leaving only two of the seven telescopes at Kitt Peak and two or three of the six at Cerro Tololo . If this happened , could NOAO still claim to be a " national " observatory ? Is the outlook really this gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Urged on by NSF , the observatories started their own planning sessions with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy ( the entity that oversees NOAO on behalf of NSF ) and with the astronomers who actually use the facilities . The goal was a plan that would meet the needs of users , while facing up to the fiscal realities . Although not yet finalized , the plan puts forth some innovative ideas for how the NOAO of the future might look . Re-engineering NOAO <p> The heart of the plan is a significant change in the way Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo are operated . Within five years , all the smaller telescopes would be closed or given to universities , which would operate them with their own funds . Only the 4-meter Mayall and WIYN telescopes at Kitt Peak and the 4-meter Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo would remain in national hands . That 's the bad news . <p> At the same time , NOAO would build three new telescopes : a 4-meter telescope in Chile and a 2.4-meter telescope at each site . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research , would be a collaboration with the University of North Carolina and Brazil . As with WIYN and Gemini , NOAO would get a portion of the time on SOAR . This project has been under consideration for some time . <p> The 2.4-meter instruments would be designed for wide-field imaging . By operating them in queue mode  --  that is , having the observations carried out by a full-time observer to make optimal use of the telescope see " All Telescopes Great and Small , " p. 13  --  nearly all the research currently done with three or four smaller telescopes could be accommodated on a single new 2.4-meter scope . The savings that the national observatories would realize by closing their many small telescopes would pay for these two new ones in less than eight years . NOAO would simultaneously reduce its costs while offering state-of-the-art telescopes  --  not a bad deal . <p> This plan suggests just one of the many possible directions that NOAO could take . What are the alternatives ? Some astronomers have called on NOAO simply to close its smaller telescopes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of NOAO to provide for the astronomical community . Hundreds of American astronomers would be unable to carry out research . <p> Another option is the quid pro quo suggested by the National Research Council committee : In return for additional money for new instruments , private observatories would provide telescope time to astronomers from other institutions see Thousand Points of Light , " p. 14 . If this strategy were adopted , astronomers who had used the Kitt Peak 2.1-meter telescope might be able to apply for time on , say , the Steward Observatory 2.3-meter telescope instead . The proposal has merit , but does not entirely replace the observing capabilities that would be lost if NOAO closed its small telescopes . <p> The national observatories are just as necessary today as 40 years ago . Amidst their direct benefits  --  open access , innovation in instrumentation and software , graduate education  --  another issue often gets overlooked : the way our field makes scientific progress . Many of the cutting-edge discoveries in astronomy are made with data pushed to their limits . The scientific truths that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vagaries of subtle instrumentation effects , analysis procedures , and sampling biases , not to mention the personal biases of the individuals doing the work . Only when different groups of astronomers , working independently , produce a consistent answer do we accept a result as fact . A well-equipped national observatory , open to all , helps to preserve the scientific checks and balances that we take for granted . <p> The profile of NOAO will certainly change significantly in the next five years . On the one hand , the new telescopes ( WIYN , Gemini ) will lead to exciting new opportunities for American astronomers . On the other , the possible cutbacks in the number of telescopes operated by NOAO could result in many of its users being unable to carry out their research . How the facilities of NOAO stack up as we enter the new millennium will depend on a number of factors , some budgetary , some political , and some scientific . I hope the latter will be the primary motivation for the decisions that are made . <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be the biggest , but the 3.5-meter WIYN is among the most sophisticated telescopes around , with a lightweight structure and active control of the mirror shape .
