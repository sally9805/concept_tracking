" SORRY ABOUT YOUR GUIDE , MARCEL , " THE OUTFITTER APOLOGIZED . " HE WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING WITH YOU ON THIS TRIP THAT HE ... UH ... WELL ... HE GOT DRUNK . YOU 'LL HAVE TO BEGIN YOUR HUNTING TRIP TOMORROW . " OUTSIDE IT WAS RAINING HARD . IT IS ALWAYS RAINING WHEN I GO MOOSE HUNTING . MY FRIEND AND I HAD PLANNED GREAT A TRIP . JUST THE TWO OF US AND THE REQUIRED guide in two canoes with minimum gear . We would strike out for the backcountry , portaging the canoes into small , remote watersheds where we could hunt moose the old-fashioned way beyond the reach of motorboats and floatplanes . At dawn we loaded the canoes , two trim 18-foot wood and canvas beauties that smacked of tradition . Then Marcel showed up . He was a short fellow wearing enormous unlaced leather boots , green pants , a red and black plaid shirt , and one of those unique little French Canadian hunting hats . He was sucking a toothpick and looked utterly destroyed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jut of his chin . " Plenty of room , " I countered . " We 'll travel in this canoe with all the food , clothing , and camping stuff ; the other canoe is for moose meat , you , and your personal gear . " " There 's no room for my personal gear , " Marcel complained . " All you need is your sleeping bag and a rainsuit , " I said . " We 've got all the rest . How much personal gear do you have ? " With that Marcel turned , sweeping his arm as if he were indicating the entrance of royalty , and gestured toward an immense heap of goods , most prominent among which was the mattress off his double bed at home , rolled and tied with a rope . There was also a 50-pound sack of potatoes and a great carton containing twenty-four loaves of bread , plus an assortment of large plastic garbage bags stuffed with blankets , pillows , and clothes . " When I go into the woods , I go comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorboat to transport Marcel and all his gear . That meant we could only go where other motorboats could go , so we never did reach the silent wilderness we sought . We never saw a moose , either , except for one poor young bull that came out into view one morning and was slain in a fusillade of shots from two motorboats full of overequipped artillerymen that immediately converged on him with all guns firing . THE NEXT YEAR , WHEN THE MISTS curled like smoke over the water and the frostbitten poplar leaves turned yellow and pungent , I again pursued my dream of a remote moose hunt conducted by canoe far beyond the throng . This time I was to accompany a man who bore the reputation of being one of Canada 's very best moose callers . Frank was half Ojibway and half Irish and had served in the Canadian Navy . He was in his late seventies when I met him and had sired children the length and breadth of Ontario and beyond . Of moose , he had slain hundreds . It was raining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote lake somewhere north of Kipewa . " We wo n't leave today because it 's raining , " Frank said . " We 'll go tomorrow . " With that he fixed dinner  --  great slabs of steak , piles of fried potatoes , cans of carrots and peas , and a whole box of cookies with coffee for dessert . In the morning it was raining still and Frank said we 'd have to wait another day . He sliced and cooked a whole canned ham and served it with a dozen eggs , a loaf of toast , and a bowl of jam for breakfast . For lunch he heated several cans of beans and served them with sliced raw onions and fried pork chops . That night he baked a chicken for dinner . The next day it was still raining and , again , Frank postponed our departure saying , " No good starting off wet ; we 'll stay here and have a good feed . " When we finally embarked on our hunt it was still raining , but we insisted on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of small lakes and eventually made camp beside an exposed sheet of granite . We got the tent up and I said , " Okay , Frank , let 's go call a moose . " " Too early , " he said . It was about 4 o'clock . " When do you want to start ? " I asked . " Mebbe 8 o'clock , " Frank said . " That 's after dark . We ca n't go then . " " Me , I have killed hundreds of moose in my life , " Frank told me . " All at night . " " What do you mean ? " I said . " You shine ' em with a light ? " " I am an old man , " Frank said in his soft Indian voice . " I ca n't hear so good no more . I 'll make the call of a lonesome cow moose and you stand beside me and listen for an answer . If you hear something , tell me what you hear and I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If it 's a moose , " he continued , " we will take the canoe along the shore and make sounds with the paddle like a moose walking and I will make beautiful love calls . You will hear the bull come into the lake and start swimming toward us . When he comes out of the water , I will shine a light in his eyes and you shoot him . " " We ca n't do that , Frank , " I told him . " White men are n't allowed to shoot at night . It 's against the law . " " It 's the only way I hunt , " Frank said stolidly . " Well , let 's make dinner and think it over , " I said . " There is no dinner , " Frank growled . " What do you mean ? " I demanded . " We 've been eating like kings . " " We ate all the food , " Frank said . " There 's only one can of peaches left . We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning , I thought . Eat it all before it gets away , then go hunt for more . Believe it or not , we did kill moose on that trip . We shot two of them , a cow and a very big bull , hunting without Frank ( he refused to hunt in daylight ) on the following morning . We just blundered into them in the rain and shot the pair . That time , there was nothing to it  --  no calling , no anticipation , just a sudden opportunity , a couple of shots , and then a hell of a lot of work . I never did get to hear Canada 's best moose caller play his birchbark horn , and the whole experience left me feeling empty , so , a few years later , I started planning another wilderness moose hunt . This time we would save ourselves a lot of trouble and do it without a guide . MY PARTNER ON THIS TRIP WAS JIM Henry , a national whitewater canoe racing champion and founder of Mad River Canoe Company . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen nine bull moose during the trip . To reach the northern hunting zone , where the moose season opened in late September , we had to paddle through 40 miles of whitewater and make a 6-mile portage around Thunder House Falls  --  we figured that would keep other people out . After killing a moose we would paddle north another 100 miles to a railroad trestle where we could flag down the Polar Bear Express freight train on its way to or from the arctic tidewater community of Moosonee on James Bay . We 'd load the canoes and the moose into a box car at the trestle and eventually wind up back in Cochrane where we had left the truck . To help with the work and provide an extra canoe to carry the meat , we brought along a nonhunting paddler , Stan , who offered to cook and do camp chores while we hunted . Now , that was a trip We ran the 40 miles of whitewater without difficulty and found we could shorten the 6-mile portage to 3 . Pike fishing was good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we reached the northern hunting zone so we set up camp the evening of the second day . By the following afternoon , the rain had turned to snow . But there was moose sign everywhere and we made strenuous attempts at calling with our birchbark horns . " Sounds more like a pig , " Jim said when I demonstrated my technique . Nevertheless , late that afternoon , as snow fell steadily , a good bull came out of the forest across the river from my calling station and I held behind the shoulder and fired three .30/06 rounds at a range of about 200 yards and heard the bullets strike . The moose crashed away back into the forest . I ran a mile upriver to where I had left the canoe , and crossed the river to our campsite , but by then it was dark and the search for my moose had to be delayed until morning . We were back at the shooting site shortly after daylight . Finding the dead moose at the end of a half-mile blood trail was easy ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes . A large Canadian bull moose weighs about 1,400 pounds . The wet hide alone weighs 100 pounds . The antler rack weighs about 75 . Field dressed , the carcass may be reduced to half a ton of meat , bone , hide , and antler that must be cut into manageable pieces and backpacked to the river 's edge . By the time we had the moose loaded in the three canoes , moose hunting had lost a lot of its romantic allure . The 100-mile paddle to the railroad trestle still loomed ahead of us and the strong north wind would be spitting snow in our faces and slowing our progress all the way . We elected to split the moose we had , forget about killing a second one , and get the hell out . That was a long paddle , but we reached the trestle in three days and arrived several hours before the southbound train was due . There was a motley collection of Indian shacks near the trestle and we had been forewarned that , while the inhabitants were normally honest people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means available . " Do n't leave the meat unattended , " we had been advised . So we took turns . One man stayed down at the river with the canoes , one man portaged meat and gear , and the third man stayed with the growing pile next to the railroad track . It was my turn at the meat pile when the first Indian appeared coming up the track with a wheelbarrow . A minute later another Indian came out of his shanty , dumped the trash out of his wheelbarrow , and started pushing it up to the track . Soon there were half a dozen Indians headed my way with wheelbarrows . What the hell am I going to do ? I wondered . I made a big display of pulling the .30/06 up across my lap and checking the magazine . The Indians seemed not to notice and kept wheelbarrowing my way . I ca n't shoot ' em , I thought . They look like they need the meat more than I do . The Indians stopped about 30 yards away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A standoff , I thought , trying to look tough . Then Jim came up with the last of the meat , saw the situation , and hollered down to Stan , " One of you guys start bringing up the canoes ; the rest of you stay down there unless we call you . " One by one , Stan brought up the canoes . The Indians watched , smoking , saying nothing and making no moves . Finally the train came . When it pulled to a stop , a boxcar door slid open and the conductor started throwing out packages that the Indians loaded into the wheelbarrows and trundled away . " Hell , " Stan said , " They were n't here for the moose meat ; they were just getting their mail " IN RETROSPECT THE TRIP STOOD OUT as a shining time so , two years later , Jim and I decided to do it again , only this time we would fly in with the canoes and skip the 40 miles of whitewater and the Thunder House Falls portage . " Let 's do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a plan , " said Jim . We made up a party of four hunters in two large canoes . We camped in the same place we had used before . It was raining , but moose sign was heavy and our spirits were high . On the third afternoon I called in a big bull . Jim shot it through the lungs with his .50 caliber muzzleloading replica rifle and Dean and Ken put in shots that ended the death throes , so we all had a piece of the action and were content to share the carcass . We made a leisurely trip of the 100 miles to the railroad trestle and reached it with time to spare before the train came . This time the Indians with their wheelbarrows did n't worry us and when the train arrived traveling north to James Bay instead of south toward our truck we just loaded everything into boxcar number 1206 and looked forward to a night up in Moosonee . But when the conductor came to sell us tickets he said , " Every Indian on this train knows there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to lose your meat , one of you will have to stay in the boxcar and nail the door shut from the inside . " We drew straws and Dean lost . When we got to Moosonee we bought poor old Dean a six-pack of Molson Export and a couple of greasy cheeseburgers , handed him a hammer , some 2x4s , and a handful of 12-penny spikes and boosted him into the boxcar with the dead moose , the canoes , and the gear . The rest of us went to the Polar Bear Hotel , showered up , and ate steaks in the dining room . Later we sent out for a bottle of Scotch that was delivered by a bootlegging Indian who scaled the hotel wall and handed us the bottle through our upstairs window , the hotel door being locked against such nighttime carryings-on . Next morning we went out to the railroad yard , found our boxcar with Dean still nailed inside with the moose . I started whacking the side of the boxcar with a rock and Dean hollered from inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conductor says we got ta nail the door shut from this side , too , " Jim shouted . " You 've got ta stay in there all the way home ... " MOOSE HUNTING IS A FUNNY BUSINESS . When a moose trip is over , you heave a great sigh of relief and all you can remember is the hard work , the cold , wet camps , and the incessant rain . I 've never finished a trip without swearing off moose hunting forever . But the next autumn you start remembering the funny stuff that happened . You hear the loons and the geese flying high overhead and smell the autumn leaves and it reminds you of moose hunting . Before long you 've got the maps out and are down on the floor running your finger over watercourses you have traveled and others you have n't traveled yet , noting the spots where you have seen moose or where you bet you could find one . You pick up the phone and call your hunting partner and say , " I 've been kinda thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man you are , he 'll jump at it . " Me , too , " he 'll say . " Let 's make a plan . ... " <p>
