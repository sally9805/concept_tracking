As Hillary Clinton 's Task Force on National Health Care Reform completed its deliberations last summer , it sometimes seemed as though the health-care debate we were told the nation was clamoring for had been replaced by a process akin to the selection of a pope . Some five hundred health-care " experts " met behind closed doors over a period of four months , occasionally emitting smoke signals for the media laced with obscure acronyms and buzzwords : HMOs , DRGs , HIPCs ( to be pronounced " Hipics , " we were instructed ) , " global budgets , " and " managed competition . " By now , the public response to the idea of health-care reform is reminiscent of the way most of us feel about our doctors when they begin spouting incomprehensible jargon : we trust that they at least know what they 're doing and pray they do no harm . The most unfortunate thing about this shuttered process is that a remarkable opportunity has been missed . What could have been a wide-open , far-ranging public debate about the deeper issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the goals of medicine , the meaning of " health , " suffering versus survival , who shall live and who shall die ( and who shall decide )  --  has been supplanted by relatively narrow quibbles over policy . It is a lot easier and safer for politicians and policymakers to talk about delivery systems , **26;32;TOOLONG procedures , and third-party payments than about what care to give a desperately ill child or whether a kidney patient over the age of fifty should be eligible for a transplant . The paradox of our current situation , however , is that unless we address such basic , almost existential questions , we stand little chance of solving our nation 's health-care crisis . Partly because of its unwillingness to confront these issues , the Clinton Administration now finds itself tangled in a profound yet largely unacknowledged contradiction . The two key goals of its health-reform plan are ( 1 ) to democratize health care  --  to confront the problem of the 40 million uninsured Americans who ca n't get adequate care ; and ( 2 ) to control the ballooning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for health care . No amount of tinkering with the process of delivery or payment , no number of new tongue-twisting acronyms , can resolve the fundamental contradiction of the Clinton plan : if you promise everyone access to whatever medical care he or she needs or wants , you will enormously increase the total amount the nation spends on health care  --  the very costs Clinton was elected to bring under control . It is of course cost , and not equity , that has driven health care to the fore of the national debate ; injustice has never been as urgent a motivating principle as insolvency . The pressure for health-care reform comes on the heels of a staggering surge in spending that threatens to swamp the federal budget and distort our national purposes , not to mention the bottom lines of America 's corporations . Twenty-five years ago , 7.6 percent of the gross domestic product was devoted to health , 6.8 percent to education , and 9.7 percent to defense . Today both defense and education expenditures are roughly 6 percent , whereas health expenditures have climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 percent by the end of the decade . It can easily be argued that it is better to spend money to cure cancer or AIDS than to build more bombs and space stations  --  and , in fact , that 's an argument I agree with . But at the rate by which we are increasing our spending on health care , soon the contest for resources will no longer pit the good guys against the bad guys . For however you define the bad guys , we are quickly running out of them . It is becoming a question of good guys versus good guys , as health-care costs gobble up money that ought to go to those authentic needs that are ancillary , yet essential , to a comprehensive conception of health : such things as drug control , education , crime prevention , housing , and poverty . Most students of the economy , and of the medical economy in particular , agree that the need to contain medical costs is absolute and urgent . The questions that divide us involve how it should be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts for the explosion in health-care costs . Most of the experts and policymakers in Washington have been focusing on the deficiencies and failures of modern medicine : greedy pharmaceutical and insurance companies ( not to mention physicians ) ; unnecessary procedures ; bureaucratic inefficiency and paperwork ; expensive technologies ; and so forth . These " efficiency experts , " as I call them , have taken control of the debate ; their ideas have been embraced by the Clinton Administration . They see the solution to our health-care crisis in terms of improving the efficiency of the system . The shibboleths that identify their approach include managed care , HMOs , and managed competition . Implicit in their recommendations is the assumption that the elimination of waste will obviate the need for " rationing " health care . Opposed to this group are those , myself included , who acknowledge that although there is waste in the system , it is incidental to the basic forces driving up costs . I would argue , in fact , that the greatest part of the increase in health-care costs can best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine but of its successes . The relentless increase in costs is actually a product of the expanding capabilities of medicine . Implicit in this view is the assumption that controlling waste will save money only in the short haul , and that we had best use the limited time such a strategy will buy to figure out a way to confront the deeper and more challenging reasons for escalating health costs : our unbridled appetite for health care and our continuing expansion of the definition of what constitutes health . The efficiency experts generally advocate a few basic , businesslike principles that , if adopted , would supposedly solve the cost crisis . The first is the need to reduce the venality of health-care providers , particularly physicians . ( If only they had the same generosity of spirit and humanity as other professionals in our society  --  say , lawyers , accountants , and bankers . ) Another way of putting this is that we must cut the fat out of the health-care system . But what system is there that has no fat ? Is our goal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automobile industry , the steel industry ? Where can we look to find models of efficient managed competition outside of medicine ? And where can we look within medicine ? A second bete noire of the efficiency experts is what is called the " halfway technologies "  --  technologies that extend the life of a patient without actually curing his or her disease . Kidney dialysis is an example . Such technologies sustain people with chronic illnesses at great expense . But the distinction is artificial : since everyone alive is destined to die , all medical technologies are halfway technologies . They sustain the human being in the terminal condition we call life . This leads directly to the third argument made by the efficiency experts . If only more money were spent on preventive medicine , as opposed to therapeutic medicine , we could solve the problem of health-care costs . The data here are misleading . We all are familiar with the examples : a measles shot costs $8 , whereas hospitalization for a child with measles costs $5,000 ; nine months of prenatal care for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature baby for one day costs $2,500 . But when you try to extend the economic analysis beyond the individual case to the entire system , it becomes clear that the rationale for preventive medicine is not an economic one . The child who would have died from polio or measles or pertussis will grow up to be a very expensive old man or woman . Preventive medicine drives up the ultimate cost of health care to society by enlarging the population of the elderly and infirm . I am certainly not opposed to preventive medicine , only to irrational arguments for its use . The proper argument for preventive medicine is the grief and misery that it averts and the fact that it allows individuals to lead healthy and productive lives . The efficiency experts offer several other explanations for ballooning health-care costs , each one based on some other supposed defect in the current system : unnecessary tests , malpractice litigation , bureaucratic waste , profiteering drug companies . Each of these factors adds its penny weight to the scales , but even together they do n't begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen . Even if we were to make angels out of hospital employees and philanthropists out of drug-company executives , we still would not stem the forward march of health-care costs . So what , if not venality and inefficiency , is really driving health costs ever upward into the stratosphere ? I would divide the principal causes into four . 1 . THE INCREASE IN MORBIDITY RATES DUE TO GOOD MEDICINE . It is often difficult for laypeople to appreciate that good medicine does not reduce the percentage of people with illnesses in our population ( what is called the morbidity rate ) ; it increases that percentage . There are more people wandering the streets of the cities of the United States with arteriosclerotic heart disease , diabetes , essential hypertension , and other expensive chronic diseases than there are in Iraq , Nigeria , or Colombia . Good medicine keeps sick people alive , thereby increasing the number of sick people in the population ; patients who are killed by their disease are no longer a part of the population . Even outright cures of diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about diphtheria rates or whooping-cough rates , even though those were the two leading causes of death in children for many generations . Those diseases have ceased to exist . But they were rarely expensive . The child either lived or died , and , for the most part , did so quickly and cheaply . 2 . THE EXPANDING CONCEPT OF HEALTH . Health today does not mean what it did a hundred years ago . If I might begin by casting stones at my own glass house , consider the case of psychiatry , though psychiatry is not the worst offender . The fact is that the patients I deal with in my daily practice would not have been considered mentally ill in the nineteenth century . Mental illness then was rigidly defined . Those considered mentally ill were insane  --  patently different from you and me  --  and they were put into hospitals . The leading causes of mental illness were tertiary syphilis and schizophrenia . This , more or less , was psychiatry ( a minor branch of neurology ) at the turn of the century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freud decided that people did not have to be exclusively either crazy or sane , but that a normal person , like himself or people he knew , could be partly crazy . These " normal " people , who were still in touch with reality , exhibited only isolated symptoms of irrationality  --  phobias , compulsions , etc . Freud invented a new category of mental diseases now called " neuroses , " thereby vastly increasing the population of the mentally ill . Some thirty years later , Wilhelm Reich decided that one does not even have to display mental symptoms to be mentally ill , that one can suffer from " character disorders . " The personalities of even completely asymptomatic individuals might so limit their productivity or pleasure in life that we are justified in diagnosing them as mentally ill . Then medicine " discovered " the psychosomatic disorders . There are people with no symptoms of mental illness who have physical conditions with psychic roots  --  peptic ulcers , ulcerative colitis , migraine headache , allergies , and the like . These people , too , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the category , we eventually managed to get some 60 percent to 70 percent ( as one serious study found ) of the residents of the Upper East Side of Manhattan into the population of the mentally ill . What has happened in mental health has happened across the board in medicine : we have radically altered our concept of what it means to be sick or healthy . Probably the best way to understand this process is to consider how medicine goes about " discovering " new diseases . Most people assume that medical researchers first uncover an illness and then seek a cure for it . This , of course , does happen ; the infectious diseases are the paradigm case . What is less familiar , but is becoming more common , is the opposite mechanism : we discover a cure and then invent a disease to go with it . As I am writing this article I am using reading glasses . These reading glasses are paid for by a health insurer , based on the diagnosis of " presbyopia " ( an eye " disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Before the invention of the lens there was no such disease as presbyopia ; there were also no ophthalmologists . Old people were n't expected to read . A decline in faculties was simply part of the aging process ; with age , sight would be impaired or lost , as would be hearing , potency , and fertility . As we began to find treatments to delay the aging processes , we reclassified various aspects of aging as " diseases . " This vast expansion of the concept of health can be demonstrated in surgery , orthopedics , gynecology  --  indeed , in any field of medicine . Infertility , for example , was not considered a disease until this generation ; before then , it was simply a God-given condition . With the advances of modern medicine  --  including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , and surrogate mothering  --  new cures were discovered for " illnesses " that now had to be invented . All of them make demands on the health-care dollar . Another example : People do not get their knees or elbows operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us do not work at jobs requiring physical strength . Many operations on the knee are performed strictly so that the patient can continue to play golf or ski ; it is the same with elbow operations . Are these justifiable " medical " expenses ? If one is free of pain except on the tennis court , is one " ill " ? Should " inability to play tennis " be classified as an insurable disease ? 3 . THE SEDUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE DECEPTION OF MARKETPLACE MODELS . All of us know about how doctors can be seduced by medical technology  --  how , for example , the ubiquity of delivery-room fetal monitors ( which alert obstetricians to the merest hint of fetal distress ) has contributed to a surge in cesarean sections . But it is not only the physician who is seduced by technology ; the patient and her family are , too  --  and not because of an infatuation with gadgetry , but because of the nature of decision-making in matters of life and death . Decision-making becomes distorted whenever extreme risks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the setting . A driver is probably safer in an $80,000 Mercedes than in an $8,000 Isuzu , but few people are likely to mortgage the house for the Mercedes , at least not for reasons of safety . Similarly , driving 65 miles an hour carries a greater risk of a fatal accident than driving 55 , yet this well-publicized fact does n't seem to keep many drivers under the speed limit . The possible consequence is too remote ; on a drive to Cape Cod one is thinking about a dip in the ocean , not the imminence of death . But these perceptions change in a hospital setting . Imagine if a doctor were to tell a patient that he sees no sign of a tumor in the X ray and that though a CAT scan might pick up the 1 percent of tumors that X rays miss , he is not sure it is worth the extra money . The patient would fire him on the spot . He wants any edge , however minute , when what is at stake is the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor then tells him , after a negative CAT scan , that an MRI might still pick up a tumor , the patient demands the MRI . He will mortgage the house for that , although the statistical validity of doing so , compared with exercising prudence on the highway , may make no sense . Death has a greater reality in the hospital setting . People will pay anything to defend against the possibility of death , all the more so when the money involved does n't come directly out of their own pockets . Because our approach to medical technology is special , we are wrong to assume that the marketplace in medical technology will ever follow classical patterns . Generally , as technologies mature and become more prevalent their costs decline rapidly . I remember once discussing with a brilliant money manager the perilous rise in the cost of medicine . I was being unduly pessimistic , he claimed  --  it is in the nature of new technologies to become cheaper over time , and he cited the ballpoint pen , the CD player , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that highly specialized technologies controlled by small groups of manufacturers do not respond to the marketplace in the same way that mass-produced items do . Nor did he take into account the fact that , in health matters , people are willing to pay substantially more money for relatively minor improvements . When what is being improved is life expectancy rather than , say , the fidelity of sound coming off of a recording , all the rules change . Medical technology will continue to be expensive simply because it pays to market a 1 percent improvement even though it might be 100 percent more expensive . Armed with this knowledge , a manufacturer will rush to market with an expensive procedure or a drug only marginally superior to one that is already available at a significantly lower price . 4 . THE AMERICAN CHARACTER AND APPETITE . People often ask how nations such as England and Canada can provide health care comparable to ours for much less money . First of all , they use a single-party payment system  --  that is , the government pays everyone 's health-care costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seem unwilling even to consider . Secondly , they are not , in fact , offering comparable services . Their health-care system does not make nearly as much use of technology , and they are willing , at least for now , to settle for less . ( But this appears to be changing : most nations with managed care are now accelerating their health-care spending at a more rapid rate than we are . ) The health-care crisis is at its most critical in America not only because we are the preeminent high-technology culture but also because of the nature of the American character . I was reminded of this recently during a seminar at which a distinguished English Marxist was holding forth on the venality of the American medical system by citing the higher rates of hernia-repair surgery done in America as compared with England . Since the incidence of hernias is the same in both countries , he interpreted the increased rate of repairs as the product of unnecessary surgery , driven by American greed . It occurred to me that there might be at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the one that turns out to be the most accurate , is the funnel effect . Under the medical system in England , health-care services are free and widely distributed . But in order to control costs , also to save hospital space , voluntary surgery to correct conditions that are not life-threatening is limited to a relatively small number of hospital beds . This results in a long waiting period  --  a six-lane highway leading to a single tollbooth will allow fewer cars through in an hour than one with six tollbooths . Limited facilities simply mean that the system allows for fewer hernias to be repaired in a given period of time . The disparity does not require the greed of the American surgeon . The deeper explanation , however , is rooted in differences between the American and the British characters . Americans want things solved completely and they want them solved now ; they do n't want to hear about restrictions , especially on something like health care . I can easily conceive of a typical midland Englishman actually preferring to walk around wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time he coughs , rather than rushing off for surgery to repair his hernia . The American character is different . Perhaps because of our frontier heritage , Americans refuse to believe there are limits  --  even to life itself . Consider the struggle in America to define such terms as " death with dignity , " which really means death without dying , and " growing old gracefully , " a related term that , on closer analysis , means living a long time without aging . Dying in one 's sleep at ninety-two after having won three sets of tennis from one 's forty-year-old grandson that afternoon and having made love to one 's wife twice that same evening  --  this is about the only scenario I have found most American men will accept as fulfilling their idea of death with dignity and growing old gracefully . Medical costs will bankrupt this country if they continue on their current trajectory . And there are no data to demonstrate that improved management techniques will solve the problem . " Managed care " and " managed competition " might save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other managed industries  --  such as the utilities and airlines  --  do not inspire confidence ) . But the bulk of the savings achieved by Health Maintenance Organizations has been achieved by cutting back on expensive , unprofitable facilities such as burn centers , neonatal-intensive-care units , emergency rooms , and the like . In other words , HMOs conduct what amounts to a hidden form of health-care rationing  --  confident in the knowledge that municipal and university hospitals are still around to pick up the slack . As the managers of HMOs know only too well , the surest ways to contain health-care spending are to limit access to health care and to rethink our ever-expanding concept of health . But if we must have allocation , the process should not be hidden from public view or determined by a small group of health-care professionals . It requires open discussion and wide participation . When what we are rationing is life itself , the decisions must be subjected to public scrutiny and debate . The first step is to admit to the cruel necessity of rationing health care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to principles of equity and justice . The kinds of questions we will need to debate can be divided into three : issues of access ( how do we decide who gets to receive a scarce health resource ? ) , egress ( how long may they receive it ? ) , and allocation ( what medical services can the system as a whole provide to everyone ? ) . 1 . ACCESS . We can no longer leave to the marketplace decisions about access to medical care . We do not want kidneys to be sold to the highest bidder , and yet we now tolerate something perilously close to that . People can still use influence , power , position , and simply money to buy access to life-sustaining services . It is disgraceful to see a parent forced to " advertise " for a liver for her baby on Oprah while the governor of Pennsylvania is rushed to the head of the line for his heart and liver transplant . Access to scarce health resources must be organized on some equitable basis  --  even if equitable does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are various factors we might consider in evaluating competing claims on scarce and expensive services . One obvious consideration is age . Most of us would agree that a seventy-two-year-old man , let alone a ninety-two-year-old man , has less of a claim on an organ transplant than a thirty-two-year-old mother or a sixteen-year-old boy , all other things being equal . And yet proponents of such policies are commonly attacked as " ageists . " These are never easy decisions . They force us to face our own mortality and demand that we look beyond our own sympathies and interests . But they must be confronted nevertheless . When I recently presented the problem of access to an interdisciplinary class of law , medical , and theology students , the students ' first response was that a lottery would be the best way to guarantee fairness . Yet leaving such an important decision to a lottery  --  precisely because it seeks to avoid questions of justice and fairness  --  is itself immoral . If my name were put into a drawing for access to a lifesaving resource along with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the lucky one drawn , my first act upon recovery would be to throttle the idiot who set up such a system . Claims on life must be based on enunciated values . Only after we have decided on our priorities and established our categories should we consider using a lottery , as we have done when we have operated a wartime draft . 2 . EGRESS . The ethical dilemmas do not end with decisions about access to scarce services or technologies ; now comes the even trickier ( and seldom asked ) question of deciding if and when that access should end . Imagine a system in which we have a limited number of artificial-heart devices . We must allocate not only a patient 's access but also the amount of time he or she may have on this lifesaving machine . A year might seem insufficient ; so might five . But forever until death ? Even when someone else , much younger , will be dying while waiting for access to that very machine ? So perhaps we pull the plug after an agreed-upon period  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been forced out onto the treacherous moral ground of euthanasia  --  and yet this is precisely where our technology , coupled with our funding crisis , is taking us . It is ludicrous to think we can take away a lifesaving technology once we have introduced it . Since every new medical technology , however expensive , quickly becomes part of the therapeutic norm ( and , from the patients ' point of view , no longer a privilege but a right ) , we might be better off deciding in advance not to develop certain new technologies . Such an argument is now being made by bioethicists in debates over the boundaries of future medical research . Some argue , for example , that in view of the health-care system 's current economic problems , we ought not develop a left-ventricular pump ( essentially , a portable artificial heart ) . But how can we limit scientific inquiry ? We ca n't  --  but we can debate what we as a society are willing to fund , just as we now debate whether we really need a supercollider. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide to everyone ? Here lies the political mine field that the Clinton Administration has apparently decided not to cross . From all indications , the Clinton plan will offer a very generous package of " basic " health-care benefits to be made available to everyone . Guided by a group of " policy wonks " and quants disdainful of the sticky dilemmas inherent in moral reasoning and terrified by the ambiguities inevitable when dealing with values , the Clinton task force has indulged in the wishful thinking that we can have it all  --  as long as we get the flow charts and systems theory right . By focusing exclusively on cost efficiency , the Clinton plan will do little to disturb the self-deceptive and self-destructive belief that we can meet every Americans every " health " need : artificial organs , genetic screening , transplants , unproven AIDS drugs , psychotherapy for unhappiness , surgery for the tennis elbow , intensive care for the infirm elderly as well as for the two-pound fetus . But we can not do everything for everybody . Limited resources will force us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now , under the Clinton plan , then very soon . To the uninitiated , these may look like medical choices , best made by medical professionals . In fact , they are not medical choices ; they are moral and ethical ones , best made by all of us , struggling toward consensus through the usual , sloppy devices of democratic government . Perhaps this is too much to ask of a governmental task force . But there is a precedent for just such a public process . Five years ago the state of Oregon attempted to confront the very dilemma the Clinton task force has chosen to duck . Oregon sought to guarantee a basic health-care package to everyone ; at the same time , it acknowledged that doing so would bankrupt the state unless some hard choices were made about what should constitute " basic health care . " Not all health services could be included . In other words , Oregon faced up to the issue of allocation , and it did so out in the open : in a series of town meetings and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical priorities were debated publicly , sometimes fiercely . The state 's health commission then published a comprehensive list of medical conditions and treatments , each ranked according to its costs and benefits . More debate ensued ; the list was revised . Finally , the legislature decided exactly where on the revised list the state could afford to draw the necessary cutoff line : it would pay for hip replacements and neonatal care , for example , but not liver transplants or in vitro fertilization . ( Oregonians who still wanted such treatments were free to pay for them . ) By conducting much of this process in public , the health commission was able to develop a consensus behind some otherwise unpopular decisions . The Oregon plan is by no means perfect . But at least the state has addressed the uncomfortable truth that they can not have equity in their health-care system without making anguished , even tragic choices . Even more important , the people of Oregon have had a searching public conversation about new technologies and medical priorities , chronic care and cosmetic surgery  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really means to be healthy . That is probably a lot more than the rest of us can expect from the narrow , numbing discussion of systems and policies and acronyms that the President insists on calling a health-care debate . We are now told that the President 's health-care plan must be " sold " to the American public . Of course , had the plan been authored by the American public , it would not now have to be sold to it . But the task force was more concerned with secrecy than participation , and little interested in the questions of life and health and death that would have engaged the public 's attention . It should come as no surprise that the result of such a process would be bad medicine : a prescription for ineffectual treatment based on a faulty diagnosis .
