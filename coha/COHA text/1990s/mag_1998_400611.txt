You do n't have to suffer just because you 're a woman . // Our unique health woes are not terribly pleasant to think about : infections of the vagina and bladder , fibrous growths in the breasts ( we wo n't even get into labor pains ) . In part , we have our anatomy to thankmammary glands , enclosed genitalia and a urinary tract that 's shorter than men 's and more prone to infection . But must we endure these problems just because we 're women ? " We 're conditioned to think that chronic discomfort and even disabling pain are natural or the result of raging hormones that ca n't be controlled , " says Carolyn DeMarco , M.D. , a women 's health specialist in Toronto and author of Take Charge of Your Body ( The Well Women Press , 1997 ) . But these conditions do not have to be accepted as part of a woman 's lot , nor do they necessarily require invasive medical approaches or prescription drugs . Natural medicine-and a simple , vegetarian lifestyle-can be all you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in normal discharge , vaginal infections are caused by an overabundance of bacteria , or single-cell fungi called candida albicans . In a healthy vagina , infection-causing microorganisms are kept in check by an acid/alkaline balance and " friendly " bacteria . However , many medications ( especially antibiotics ) , an unhealthy diet or a stress-filled life can throw off your internal chemistry , giving the little devils the chance to multiply . " Treatment varies depending on the microbe responsible , so it 's important to differentiate between a yeast and a bacterial infection , " says DeMarco . Yeast typically produces mucous that smells like bread or beer , while bacteria produce a discharge with a slightly fishy odor . Recurrent yeast infections can be a sign of a more serious yeast overgrowth throughout the body . Here are some ways to manage infections . If you 're in doubt about the nature of yours-or if you 're pregnanttalk with your health-care provider before treating yourself . Photograph // Eat right . " Diet is the single most important contributing factor in recurring infections , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making you less resistant to infection as well as encouraging the growth of troublesome microorganisms . " Yeast absolutely thrives on sugar , " explains Shari Lieberman , Ph.D. , a clinical nutritionist in New York City and coauthor of The Real Vitamin and Mineral Book ( Avery Publishing Group , 1990 ) . " Think about baking bread . As soon as you add sugar to the yeast starter , it goes nuts . " She recommends eliminating refined sugar , concentrated sweets like dried fruit and fruit juices , as well as bleached wheat flour and baked goods . " But do n't turn to artificial sweeteners , " DeMarco warns . They 'll only trigger more cravings and make it that much harder to skip the sweets . Many women also reduce yeast infections by eliminating dairy . Go herbal . If you have an active bacterial or yeast infection , DeMarco suggests using fresh garlic as a vaginal suppository . Peel a whole clove and wrap it in a piece of cheesecloth to resemble a tampon with a cloth " tail . " Insert and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution of two tablespoons of vinegar in a quart of water . Do this daily for three days . You also can buy a commercially prepared vaginal suppository that contains tea tree oil , a potent antimicrobial , and follow package instructions . Or add eight to 10 drops of tea tree oil to warm bath water and soak for 20 minutes . ( Never apply undiluted tea tree oil to the vagina . ) Grapefruit seed extract also is very effective against a variety of microorganisms , says Margi Flint , an herbalist based in Marblehead , Mass. , who teaches herbal medicine at Tufts University Medical School in Boston . Take 20 drops orally three times a day during an acute infection . ( Because it 's bitter , you may prefer to put the extract into empty veggie caps . ) Flint also recommends an herbal tea made from one part each raspberry leaf , sage leaf and mullein flower and one-quarter part barberry . Make four cups every day ; drink three , cool the fourth and use it as a douche . Do not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normally , douching is unnecessary and can actually contribute to recurring infections by disturbing the vagina 's normal moisture balance , says DeMarco . But a gentle douche can help wipe out infection-causing microbes . Use either of the douches described above , but never douche more than three times a week . Keep things moving . According to Ayurveda , the ancient Indian school of natural medicine , vaginal infections are caused by a buildup of impurities called area . Nancy Lonsdorf , M.D. , medical director of the Maharishi Vedic Medical Center in Rockville , Md. , and co-author of A Woman 's Best Medicine ( Jeremy P. Tarcher , 1993 ) , suggests exercising regularly and avoiding cold , heavy foods , especially if you have an infection . Instead , she recommends eating light , spicy foods ( seasoned with warming herbs like cumin and ginger ) and cooked dishes like steamed vegetables and legumes . " Make sure you 're getting enough fiber , " stresses DeMarco . Good sources include fresh fruit and vegetables . You can take psyllium powder ( see label for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your digestion is sluggish . Cultivate " good " bacteria . Lactobacillus acidophilus , a beneficial bacteria sold in health food stores , maintains the proper acid balance in the vagina to prevent " bad " bacteria and yeast from proliferating . Take one-quarter teaspoon twice a day for prevention ; take half a teaspoon when you have an infection . Eating a cup of yogurt that contains active cultures each day also is effective , says Lonsdorf . Yogurt also makes a good topical remedy for acute yeast infections . Larry Kincheloe , M.D. , a holistic obstetrician and gynecologist in Oklahoma City , suggests inserting yogurt directly into the vagina ( use the applicator that comes with over-the-counter yeast-infection products or a bulb baster ) . Apply one tablespoon once a day , at bedtime , for up to seven days . Boost your immunity . Echinacea stimulates your immune system , helping to fight active infections and avoid new ones . ( Bonus : Echinacea also has antifungal and antibacterial properties . ) Take up to 50 drops of a standardized extract orally per day . De Marco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid vaginal infections . If you tend to get infections right before your period ( and many women do because hormone fluctuations change the vagina 's acid/alkaline balance ) , take echinacea for a week before menstruation and through your period . CYSTITIS AND UTIs Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) , characterized by a burning sensation and painful urination , are caused by bacteria in the bladder and urethra , through which urine flows out of the body . UTIs cause a painful irritation of the bladder and urinary tract called infectious cystitis . A less common chronic version , interstitial cystitis , can occur without any infection . Though its cause is unknown , researchers believe it 's an autoimmune response , the product of an oversensitive bladder or triggered by the consumption of acidic or fermented foods . UTIs are common in women who 've had surgery or a lower back injury that prevents the bladder from emptying completely , thus allowing bacteria to flourish in the leftover urine . Likewise , using a poorly fitting diaphragm also can impede bladder function . And the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hospitable to bacteria , have been associated with a higher incidence of UTIs . Echinacea ( see dosage above ) and garlic ( eat two to three raw cloves a day or take a pill form and follow package dose directions ) help prevent and fight UTIs . Lieberman also suggests getting at least 1,000 milligrams ( mg. ) of vitamin C , 10,000 international units ( IU ) of natural betacarotene and 400 IU of natural vitamin E a day . Eat plenty of whole foods , including colorful vegetables , for natural doses of these antioxidants . To treat the inflammation of infectious and interstitial cystitis and prevent future flare-ups , look to the following remedies : Analyze your diet . " Diet should be your number one concern with cystitis , " says DeMarco . Flint agrees : " I tell people to cut out the SCAR foods : sugar , caffeine , alcohol and refined stuff . " This is good advice for anyone , but especially for women enduring recurring interstitial cystitis . Stay hydrated . Moving liquids through the urinary tract is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in . Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day . At the first sign of an infection , mix a teaspoon of baking soda into one of the glasses . Try tea . For recurring cystitis , make one of your daily drinks a cup of this soothing , mildly diuretic herbal tea . Mix equal parts com silk , marshmallow root , uva ursi ( also known as bearberry ) , St. John 's wort and chamomile . Use one teaspoon of the dried herbs per cup of water . When you got ta go ... Go . But cruelly , one symptom of cystitis is the sensation that you urgently have to urinate , although you may only produce a few drops . But if you have an infection , heed the call-even if urination is painful . Insert here . If you 're prone to recurring infections , DeMarco suggests changing your internal chemistry to be less hospitable . " For immediate relief , give yourself a vaginal suppository of acidophilus in 00-size veggie caps , and leave in overnight . Do this every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For long-term prevention , continue doing this once a week for six months . " Consider cranberry . " Cranberry juice can help prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of the urinary tract , " says Kincheloe . Buy unsweetened juices , or look for brands sweetened with other fruit juices ( like apple ) instead of refined sugar . Drink 8 ounces a day as a preventive and as much as you can if you have an active infection . Most experts recommend juice , but you also can buy cranberry in tablets and capsules ( follow dosage directions on the label ) . See alternative practitioners . DeMarco has had success treating infections with homeopathy , but says that since every case is different , you need to have a full evaluation . She also refers patients to chiropractors ( for lumbar adjustments ) and acupuncturists , who also report good results . FIBROCYSTIC BREAST DISEASE ( FCBD ) An estimated 80 percent of all women suffer from this condition , characterized by painful lumps in their breasts , says DeMarco . Though benign , these small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt more right before your period . Follow these suggestions to ease your discomfort . Eliminate coffee . Caffeine , also found in soda , tea and chocolate , is a huge culprit here . " Women have an 80 percent success rate in eliminating FCBD when they cut out caffeine , " says Kincheloe . Balance your hormones . Benign breast lumps have been linked to hormonal imbalances , notes Lieberman . To level things out , eat lots of soy , which contains phytoestrogens , beneficial precursors to human hormones . Avoid animal foods , which contain xenoestrogens , chemicals that can interfere with normal estrogen levels . Take supplements . According to DeMarco , vitamin E can help reduce the size-and discomfort-of breast fibroids . And she recommends vitamin C , betacarotene and bioflavonoids ( see dosages above ) . Flaxseed , borage and evening primrose oils , all sources of the essential fatty acid gamma linoleic acid ( GLA ) , also help ease symptoms . " The results are amazing , " says Flint . Follow label dosage guidelines , as products vary . Or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flint also advises taking an extract of yarrow , which helps relieve congestion in the tissues . Start with three drops , three times a day , and work up until you notice a difference , she suggests . Do n't exceed label recommendations .
