THINK YOUR HOME IS PRIVATE ? THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE WHAT GOES ON INSIDE YOUR BEDROOM ? SO DID SUSAN WILSON  --  UNTIL SHE DISCOVERED THE VIDEO CAMERA THAT A NEIGHBOR HAD HIDDEN IN HER ATTIC . BY JOYCE MAYNARD // ONE DAY LAST SUMMER&lt; JUST BEFRE everything changed , Susan Wilson , a 40-year-old mother of three , held a " lock-in " at her Monroe , Louisiana , home for a group of teenage girls from her church-a sleepover to bring them together for spiritual instruction . She had baked two batches of cupcakes : one beautifully decorated , with red , white , and blue frosting and sprinkles ; the other totally plain . " Of course everybody chose the pretty ones , " she recalls . " But when they bit into them , they gagged . I had put pepper and garlic in that batch . " Her lesson to the girls that night was not to trust in appearances , that it 's what 's inside that counts . As the mother of a teenage daughter , Susan understood how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was probably another reason she chose the theme : A strikingly pretty woman with long , wavy hair and perfect skin whose body testifies less to having given birth three times than to years of marathon running and in-line skating , Susan must have been noticed for her looks all her life . " I did n't want my daughter , or the other girls , viewed as an object put on earth for the pleasure of men , " she says . Prompted by the cupcake lesson , several girls raised a troubling issue that night . One said it made her uncomfortable when Steven Glover , the 42-year-old deacon in charge of the youth ministry at their church and Susan 's neighbor , made remarks about how cute she looked and how good she smelled . Others chimed in their agreement . None of this was news to Susanshe 'd felt the same way about Steven for years . She 'd just never been able to resolve the problem . In fact , at the time of the " lock-in , " she did n't even realize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a good , obedient girl , " Susan says , sitting on the piano bench in her modest , sunny home on a crisp February day . Married since she was 19 , Susan homeschools her children , goes to church every Sunday , and has n't held a job outside her home since her wedding day . " My goal in life was to get married and have children . When a man said you were pretty , you smiled . Even if he did more than that , you still smiled . " Respecting your elders still means a lot in the Wilson household : Susan and her husband , Gary , have taught their children to say " Yes , ma'am " or " Yes , sir " when addressed by an adult . So when Steven patted the leg or the bottom of the Wilsons ' 16-year-old daughter , Emily , as he sometimes did , Emily kept it to herself . " I wish my daughter could have felt safe speaking up , " says Susan , " before things got out of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I never spoke up myself ? " Susan first met Steven Glover in 1968 in her hometown of Starkville , Mississippi , back in junior high . " I guess you 'd call him ... a nerd , " she says , hesitating . " Steven was always hanging around the girls , but they 'd pretty much ignore him . Then he got together with one of the brightest , most active , vivacious girls at school , Nancy Blair . We all wondered what she saw in him . " The pair married right out of school . Photograph Susan Wilson ( center ) . with children Emily . Amy . and Orin. and husband Gary // By her senior year of high school , Susan had met her future husband , Gary Wilson , a graduate student studying entomology at Mississippi State . " What I loved about Gary right away was how he always supported my independence , " she says . " My parents were so strict and protective , getting married was the first freedom I ever had . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was so shy and fearful , I 'd stay home all day , fixing the house , planning what to make for supper . " Gary got a job with the state of Louisiana , advising farmers on pest control , and the couple moved to Monroe , a city of 50,000 in the Delta country . Susan was glad to soon discover two familiar faces at their church : Nancy and Steven Glover . Steven had recently leased a piece of land outside of town with the plan of raising cotton and soybeans ; Nancy worked for the state , reviewing grants for farm loans . Saturday nights , they 'd get together with other couples from the church to watch movies and make ice cream . The Glovers had children around the same time as the Wilsons , and their children became friends . As a farmer , Steven was free a lot during the winter ; he 'd stop by the Wilsons ' house often to pick up or drop off kids , but mostly just to chat . Even early on , Susan says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He always had opinions about her life ; he did n't think much of her devotion to running and marathon training . He criticized her decision to get her college degree , her driving , and her clothes , telling her that her thighs were too fat for her to wear skirts above the knee . More than one woman from church remembers Steven as a man obsessed with female appearance . " We all knew he liked to hug on the women , " says Michele C. Greer , 30 , as her mother , Donna , 51 , nods in agreement . That was just Steven . " He 'd always comment on how you looked , " adds Sandy Hayes , 20 , who often babysat for the Glovers . " He 'd smell your hair and tell you the name of the fragrance . He 'd say , If I was younger , I 'd give the boys a run for their money with you . " ' As the church 's youth counselor , Steven organized a plan to set up concession stands at football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they had enough money , the kids were to go on a field trip to Six Flags amusement park . " One day he said we should go to the water park instead , " recalls Sandy . " My older sister said the girls might feel self-conscious unless they wore T-shirts over their bathing suits . Mr. Steve said that was unnecessary . My sister held her ground , and finally he dropped it . " But Steven had another plan to get the women of his church into their swimsuits . " He and Nancy bought this hot tub , " says elementary school teacher Tisha Parker , 24 , also a church member " He was always after us to come over and take a hot tub . We never heard the end of it . " " When I was getting married , he told me I should bring my whole wedding party over to relax , " recalls Michele . Like Tisha and Sandy and Susan , she remembers Steven pointing out the precise spot in his laundry room where she should stand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just wear our suits over since we just lived down the street , " she says . " He kept saying , Why 'd you want to do that when you can change right here ? " ' And to Sandy Hayes , who continued to resist the hot tub on her nights of babysitting , he said , " I 'll bet you ten dollars you do n't take a hot tub tonight . " To win the bet , she did . But no woman seemed to preoccupy him more than Susan Wilson . " I knew that Susan was n't welcoming the attention , " says Gary , a quiet man . " It was just something she put up with . " HOW DID HE KNOW SO MUCH ? Despite the Wilsons ' growing reservations about him , when Steven told them about a house for sale in his neighborhood , the news felt like a godsend . " The place we 'd been living in was so tiny , " says Susan . " This one had four bedrooms and a big yard and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by the church , we could never have afforded it . " Because he 'd been given the job of keeping an eye on the property , Steven had a key and promised he 'd help get the Wilsons a good price . They moved in around Christmas 1997 . Susan remembers feeling uncomfortable when Steven kept the key to their new house , but once again , she said nothing . Steven had given them his own house key , suggesting that they keep an eye on each others ' homes . " I was uneasy moving so close to Steve and Nancy , " Susan says . " But I figured things could n't very well get out of control with Nancy right there . " But Nancy worked long hours , and Steven took to visiting Susan often during the day . " One day he brought over wallpaper paste and tools , and said he 'd come to help me hang wallpaper , " she recalls . " I told him I like to hang wallpaper alone , but he just would n't take no for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in our yard without asking if we wanted it . It got to the point where I did n't even want to answer the door . I 'd be playing the piano and hear his knock , and I 'd just play louder . Then I 'd see him lurking behind the hedge , trying to get my attention . " " I 'd come home and there was Steve , weed-eating my driveway , " says Gary . " And the weeds at his own house would be up to your knees . He 'd say to me , " I know how to treat women ' ' - as if I was n't taking care of my wife properly . " More and more , Steven seemed to know what was going on in the Wilsons ' lives . He told Gary he should install a better floor in the attic , instead of just drywall . " Another time , " recalls Susan , " I was looking in the mirror and I said out loud , Talk about a bad hair day ! ' and a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your hair does n't look that bad . " ' Emily remembers telling her mother one day she was looking for someone to go jogging with her . " Five minutes later there 's a knock at the door , " she says , " and Mr. Steve says , " I was just going for a jog and wondered if you 'd like to come . " ' Sometimes Steve 's remarks to Susan were flattering . He 'd bring his camera over and take her picture . " And what did I do when he put the camera in my face ? " muses Susan . " Oh , I smiled . " Other times , he 'd be hostile and disapproving . " He told me it looked like I 'd been poured into my jeans , " she says . " What do you say to that ? " He told me nobody knew me like he did , " Susan recalls . " ook at you , ' ' " he said . " You do n't even have a best friend . " ' SPYING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Shy and reserved to begin with , she 'd been home with the children for so many years that she rarely met new people . Then , at an event for parents who home-school , she met Kathy Kicklighter , who 'd recently moved back to Monroe . An outgoing 37-year-old mother of four , Kathy seemed like exactly the sort of woman Susan wanted as a friend . The two quickly grew close , and Susan found herself telling Kathy about Steven . She admitted that they were so concerned their house might be bugged that Gary had checked their walls and their phones for bugging devices . " I was shocked that she could n't see for herself how unhealthy the situation had become , " says Kathy . " But it was like what happens if you put a frog in cold water and bring it slowly to a boil . Susan and Gary had been living with this so long , they could n't recognize how bad it had gotten . " With Kathy 's encouragement , Susan agreed to a plan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town and then let ourselves into their house . We did n't even really know what we were looking for . I just wanted to prove to myself that all my fears were crazy . " So a few weeks later , when the Glovers went to visit Nancy 's relatives , the two women sent their husbands to the movies with the kids and went over to the Glovers ' ' - feeling , Susan says , " like we were in some Nancy Drew book . " Susan headed straight to Steven 's desk , where she spotted an unmarked videotape . Kathy suggested they stick it in the VCR . An image of a rumpled , unmade bedviewed from above-appeared on the screen . " What 's the Glovers " bed doing on the tape ? " Susan asked , adding , " I do n't think we should be watching this . " Then it hit her . It was n't the Glovers ' bed-it was hers . The women watched the tape , stunned . After a few minutes , the image changed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gary . They ejected the tape and returned to the Wilsons ' ' . When the men got home , Barry Kicklighter and Gary climbed the pull-down stairs leading from the carport to the attic crawl space . There , in the far corners of the attic , Gary discovered a surveillance camera pointed toward a tiny pinhole cut in the drywall over their bedroom , with a VCR and TV monitor attached . There was another pinhole directly over the shower and toilet in the master bathroom , and a third over the children 's bathroom . Knowing the Glovers were due back in town soon , the two couples copied the tape and returned the original to the desk . Then they called the police . " We were in shock , " Susan says . " At that point , it still had n't fully sunk in what this meant . " Back at the police station , though , detectives were having a problem : There was no law on the books to prosecute Glover for what he 'd done . According to district attorney Jerry Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime would have been covered by the Peeping Tom statutes . But he was working from inside their house , and he had a key . In the end , all they could charge him withbecause he had to plug in the surveillance equipment-was burglary of electricity . The next day two officers visited the Wilsons . Not surprisingly , Steven spotted the car and called Gary at work to ask what was going on . Gary said simply that they 'd had a little problem . Steven then paid a visit to Gary 's office . " I guess I know what this is about , " Steven said . Gary said he guessed he did . Shortly thereafter , Steven , accompanied by two church elders , turned himself in to the police . After his arrest , Steven signed a form authorizing the police to search his home . The way the police then handled the situation still troubles the Wilsons : Instead of obtaining a search warrant that might have enabled them to seize all potentially incriminating videotapes , two officers asked Nancy to voluntarily hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember seeing dozens of tapes ( they 'd only watched the one they found in Steven 's desk ) , Nancy turned over just four . The Glovers maintain that only those four were homemade ; the rest were family tapes and commercially produced pornography . Steven later brought the tapes to his farm , where he burned theman action that , he told the church elders , was proof that he had purged himself of his desire to view pornography . A few hours after Steven 's arrest , two church elders bailed out their deacon . And that night , Susan received a phone call from elder Ken Williams , expressing sympathy and telling her the situation was now under control , and that from here on , the church would be handling it . " Ken told me the number to call to tell the police I 'd be dropping the charges , " Susan says . " Most of the time , when men told me to do something , I did it . " Not this time . The next day , the elders paid Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian thing to do was forgive him and keep this matter quiet so we could all move on with our lives , " says Susan . " I told them I believe in forgiveness too . I have prayed plenty for Steven Glover and his family . But a person has to be accountable . Steven has a deep problem that is n't going to go away just because he 's been caught . " WHAT THE TAPES REVEALED In the days that followed , Susan learned just how much of her own intimate behavior Steven had observed . When she could finally bring herself to view the tapes , she discovered that Steven had not only watched her in bed , but also in the shower and on the toilet . " There are things a person does every day , but you never actually see yourself doing them , " she says . " When you dowhen you watch all those little actions you make , that you never even think of-it 's the most humiliating experience . Seeing myself and my daughters on the toilet , watching myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pubic hair ... and knowing he was studying me that whole time .. . I felt raped . " The invasion of her privacy did n't stop there . " I 'd walk in the police station and wonder which of those men had watched me on the tapes , " she says . " And then there were the lawyers . At one point , Glover 's lawyer threatened that if I continued to press charges , my tapes would be shown in open court . " Sheriff Chuck Cook is adamant that only three officers watched the tapesand only on fast-forward . District attorney Jones asserts that to this day he refuses to look at them . But Susan believes the officer in charge of evidence abused his access . " One time , when I came to view the tapes , " she recalls , " he looked me up and down and said , " I see you 've lost weight . " " When she told him that she could now shower only in the dark , he told her she should n't feel ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a beautiful body . " The tapes revealed that Steven had videotaped other women , too . A camera in his laundry room , aimed at the spot where he directed women to change before entering the hot tub , captured Tisha Parker and a friend undressing . Tisha wept when she saw it . " Nobody but my husband was ever supposed to see my body like that . " If Steven had videotaped a minor , the charges against him would have been far more serious . Emily was the only person under age 18 visible on the tapes , and because she was not naked , the authorities were not confident that charges of unauthorized taping of a minor would hold up under appeal . But the fact that-unlike the tapes shot at the Wilsons ' ' - the hot tub tapes contained audio did allow for the additional charge of oral interception of communication , a felony . BLAMING THE VICTIM It was June 28 , 1998 , when Susan Wilson and Kathy Kicklighter first discovered the tape in the desk , but the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In early July , the church deacons read a statement by Steven Glover to the congregation , offering his resignation as deacon and youth counselor . Acknowledging in the vaguest terms that he had brought reproach upon the church , Steven asked for the forgiveness of his fellow parishioners . After the service , remembers Janice Hayes , 45 , people crowded around Steven and Nancy to ask what they could do to help . " Because he never really said what he 'd done , " Janice says , " most people just assumed it must have to do with his farm . We all prayed for them that week . And every week after that , we were asked to pray for them . " Not present in the prayers of the congregants were Susan and Gary Wilson and their children , who by then had joined a church across town . Rumors soon spread through the church community that Susan had led Steven on with racy outfits , begging him to come over . One of Steven 's lawyers contended that they were having an affair ; Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " In a way , I guess that 's true , " says Susan . " Only I did n't know I was doing it . " ) When asked by this reporter to respond to the Wilsons ' sense of abandonment by their church , Minister Stephen Teel hung up the phone . Enduring the icy looks and gossip of a few onetime friends , Susan felt as if her life had been ripped apart all over again . " With so many people behaving as if this was n't such a terrible to think what had happened to me was all that bad , " she says . " And if it was n't important , that must mean nobody thought my feelings were important . I did n't matter . " For a while , Susan could n't play the piano ( " I kept seeing Steven 's face , looking in the window of my music room " ) . Sometimes she even wore her clothes in the shower . " I felt fearful all the time , " she says . " The only safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened , so that was n't safe either . I was living in a crime scene . " As for Gary , " I ca n't even deal with my own grief yet , " he says . " I 'm still trying to do the best I can for my wife . " Susan started going into her closet for refuge ; sometimes she 'd stay there for hours . She was spending so much time there that she put a mat on the floor . Her children came to understand when she would disappear , she says . It was just Mom , going into the closet again . One feels hesitant to broach the subject , but it has to be asked-what the experience of having her sex life recorded on videotape has done to the couple 's intimate relationship . " I love my husband dearly , " Susan says quietly . " He 's been the kindest , most understanding man in the world through all of this . I could n't ask for a more supportive husband . He even tried to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me all Steven saw was Gary 's own big , old rear end . " But something is gone for me . Everything we used to do , that Steven Glover recorded , was destroyed . You have to find new ways to do things that he did n't see . But making love-that kind of joy-there was only one thing like that . I ca n't seem to get that feeling back . " As the Wilsons struggled to recover some sense of privacy , the Glovers were settling into a new life . Deep in debt to the government for a loan he could n't repay because his crop had failed , Steven sold his house and moved to Tennessee . He got a new job as a car salesman and enrolled in Christian counseling classes . Appearing ( in shadows ) with his wife on the Leeza show last summer , he announced that he had had a pornography addiction but was now cured . " Things just got out of control , " he said . " Tisha Parker was totally innocent , " he acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . " Taping Susan , he implied , was a different matter . Yes , he had sinned , but what could you expect when a woman threw herself at you the way Susan Wilson had ? " The relationship that Susan and I had was extremely intimate for over a decade , " he told the audience . ( Susan was not present to challenge his assertion . ) " You want to see the phone bills ? You want to see the phone calls to and from my cell phone ? " Steven pled guilty to charges of unauthorized entry into an inhabited dwelling and received a suspended jail sentence with three years probation . He was ordered to pay the Wilsons $2,000 in damages , for counseling and repairs to their ceiling . The Wilsons are now pursuing a civil suit against him , believing the damage he caused will take more than some new plaster to repair . " I WAS JAMES BOND " Having spent her first four decades avoiding calling attention to herself , Susan is now campaigning for a new law , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specifically address the growing threat of video voyeurism . She hopes Louisiana 's law will become a model for other states , where-with few exceptions-there remains little recourse for private citizens who are secretly taped . When she and Gary traveled to New York last year to be interviewed on the Today show , they stayed in a hotel . There , in an unfamiliar bedroom with no pinholes in the plaster overhead , they were able to retrieve something of what had been lost for so long . Although they 've found a more welcoming church community , the Wilsons plan to leave Monroe . " It 's sad , because I have friends I care about a lot here , " she says , " but I 'm not sure I could tell anyone where we went . I 'm still afraid . " Steven Glover contends he 's no longer a threat to anyone . Never was , really . He and his wife now say they have only love in their hearts for the Wilson family . " If Susan Wilson walked in the room this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her a hug . " He pauses . " Or I 'd shake her hand . " A trim , pleasant-looking woman who speaks in a faintly plaintive tone , Nancy sits close beside her husband as she describes the devastation of learning that he had an addiction to pornography , and what it meant for her family . She never considered leaving her husband , she says . " I believe in the commitment of marriage . You either give up , or you get on with your life . We chose to get on with ours . " Steven-who calls himself a " people person " - is more animated . " I 'm not a monster or a pervert , " he says . " I 'm just a guy who had a problem . I 've never denied what I did was wrong . The devil got in me , and I 'm getting help to make sure I never let it happen again . " The Glovers have dis- connected their Internet access to pre vent Steven from visiting any porn sites These days , Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week with his Christian support group . " I 've got myself the best woman any man could ask for , " he says , patting his wife . " Susan and I ... what Susan did ... I was weak ... I let myself get lured in ... I 'm glad I got caught , so I could get back on track . " What was going on in his mind when he set up the equipment in the Wilsons ' attic ? Partly , it was depression , he saysbecause of the uncertainties of farmingand partly the evils of pornography . " I was sick , " he adds , then smiles . " But partly it was just a game . I was James Bond . " " There 's more to the situation ... , " offers Nancy . She just ca n't say what . " Tisha getting on that tape .. that was an accident , " says Steven . He does not explain how the footage of Tisha Parker , naked , got spliced together and run twice , back to back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was all caused by one woman , and though he ca n't explain how she induced him to sneak into her attic and videotape her , he makes it plain that he feels she was hardly an innocent victim . Is he saying he had an affair with her ? That 's a hard question , he says . " Let 's just say I pity Gary , " says Steven , leaning forward in his chair , his voice rising slightly . " And it 's a shame the two of them had to drag the courts into all of this , instead of letting our church take care of it the way everyone wanted , so we could all just get on with our lives . It could 've been a win-win situation . " I hope one day she and Gary find the closeness and peace Nancy and I have , " he says , stroking his wife 's shoulder . " But Susan 's still obsessed . That 's Susan for you . Susan 's got to do what Susan 's got to do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiable . But there is suddenly a hard , unmistakably bitter edge in his voice . In the distorted world of Steven Glover , it would seem , not much could be clearer evidence of a woman 's irredeemable nature than this : She does what she wants-instead of what he wants her to .
