" Sit down ! " hissed members of the agitated crowd in front of Communist Party Central Committee headquarters in Dushanbe , capital of Tadzhikistan . Humiliated , the group of veteran Soviet combat officers and their men sank awkwardly to the ground when ordered to do so by the throng of 10,000 militant Tadzhiks . The troops then listened grimly as a mullah recited the Islamic call to prayer from atop one of their armored vehicles . <P> The startling display of religious assertiveness took place at the height of the revolt against Moscow 's rule that broke out three weeks ago in Tadzhikistan , perhaps the most ardently Islamic of the 15 Soviet republics . For the Tadzhiks who forced the soldiers to observe their demonstration of piety , the moment represented a vindication of their faith , long suppressed under the official Soviet policy of atheism . But for Soviet journalists who took in the scene , the moment may have confirmed a nightmare . <P> Under glasnost , ordinary Soviets are only now learning how deeply Islam is rooted in their federation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Central Asian republics and Azerbaijan . Among some anxious citizens , the discovery has touched off premonitions of disaster , as republic after republic is shaken by unrest , often with religious overtones . After Soviet troops were called in last January to quell bloody rioting in Azerbaijan , Igor Belyaev , a prominent Soviet commentator on Muslim affairs , warned that " Iran has threatened the Soviet Union with an Islamic conflagration . " President Mikhail Gorbachev argued that " Islamic fundamentalism " was a major factor in the rioting against minority Armenians in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku . <P> Neither Gorbachev nor Belyaev is exactly on target in Azerbaijan . Fundamentalist Islam had very little to do with the rapid growth of the republic 's Popular Front before the crushing intervention of the Soviet army in mid-January ; the main issues were autonomy from Moscow and an end to the Communist Party monopoly of power . But elsewhere , profound Islamic forces  --  some of them violent  --  have begun to shake up the status quo in response to Gorbachev 's decision to allow freedom of conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dushanbe protesters last month demanded that Islam be declared the official religion of Tadzhikistan . <P>  --  Mullahs in Tashkent are now permitted to conduct proselytizing meetings on the street , in factories , even in prisons . <P>  --  In Samarkand last summer gangs of young Tadzhik thugs roamed the local marketplace , slashing the faces of women who wore makeup . <P>  --  To compensate for a chronic lack of Islamic holy books , Saudi Arabia has printed 1 million copies of the Koran for Soviet Muslims  --  and Aeroflot has agreed to deliver them . <P>  --  Primarily in Uzbekistan but also in other Central Asian republics , Muslim TV and radio programs are now a regular feature . Some Muslim prayer gatherings are televised along with readings from the Koran . <P>  --  Across the Soviet Union 's Central Asian region , a construction and restoration program is under way that has tripled the number of functioning mosques to 250 since the beginning of 1989.
