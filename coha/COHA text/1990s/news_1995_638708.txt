<p> EDITOR 'S NOTE : This first part of a four-day package on values and the family continues an ongoing series of stories The Denver Post is publishing on issues involving children . <p> Like General Motors in the 1980s , the American family in the 1990s seems an institution in need of an overhaul . <p> Among the signs of distress : Working parents putting their preschoolers in day care for 11 1/2 hours a day . ... Affluent kids being brought up by nannies from foreign countries . Single mothers holding down two jobs and still struggling to stay out of poverty . ... Fathers who seldom see their young children . <p> High divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births , many believe , have undermined the concept of the family and robbed alarming numbers of children of the support , security and stability they deserve . <p> Hardly anyone argues that this basic building block of society should be scrapped and replaced by some trendier , sportier model ; indeed , opinion polls indicate that most Americans continue to hold up the nuclear family as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Still , there 's a widespread sense that the old sedan needs major work , if not a total restoration . <p> " We 're now at the end of about a 30-year debate on whether we have a problem on our hands . The bipartisan conclusion of scholars on both the left and right is that we do , " says David Blankenhorn , president of the New York-based Institute for American Values . <p> " Now the question becomes , what are we going to do about it ? And on that issue , there 's very little agreement . " <p> Among the countless researchers , counselors , social workers and other professionals in the field , those who might be called pessimists tend to believe that the current trends affecting the family must simply be reversed . If divorce and unmarried parenthood do n't become shameful again , they argue , society in general will suffer greatly , with particularly negative consequences for children . <p> " There 's a growing consensus that the principal cause of the decline in children 's well-being is family breakup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's getting weaker , children are doing worse , case closed , " asserts Blankenhorn , a former community organizer who is working to put family issues atop the U.S. agenda as chairman of the National Fatherhood Initiative . <p> " The whole basis of the American Dream has been that each generation will not just be economically better off , but that it will reach higher and be more fulfilled . In this generation , there has been an interruption of that tradition . " <p> The optimists , on the other hand , maintain that even though families of the future may be smaller , more diverse or less long-lived than the traditional version , society is hardly doomed . <p> " There 's no question that the family is changing , and there 's no question that a range of factors are making it difficult for families to cope . But it 's a mistake to take what are admittedly very tragic statistics for one part of the population and apply that to the whole population , " says Reed Henderson , senior vice president for member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 300 social service agencies across the country . <p> " There 's a reality that children are growing up to become productive members of society , as measured by school performance , college attendance and movement into the workforce . I would n't deny that there are problems , but those do n't represent society at large . " <p> In Colorado , more children are in two-parent families than in most other states - meaning they are generally better off both financially and emotionally , says Barbara O'Brien , executive director of the Colorado Children 's Campaign , which tracks the prime indicators of children 's well-being . <p> " Colorado families have a higher per capita income and higher education level than the nation as a whole , " she notes . " We have a really good opportunity here to get past the ideological debates over ' good ' and ' bad ' families and take a look at the families that are at risk and need help , and do something about it . Maybe we ca n't reverse societal trends , but ( we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are met . " <p> However the trends are viewed , experts from coast to coast report that Americans in general are growing more concerned about the state of the family - and especially about the role that fathers play in raising children . <p> " The real issue here is kids who do n't have adequate parenting . But what it mostly boils down to is a lack of fathering , because the mothers are normally around , " says John Calhoun , coordinator of Gov . Roy Romer 's recently formed Responsible Fatherhood Initiative . <p> " There 's no common theme , though , on just what the problem is with fathers . Is it dads who are there but are psychologically absent ? Is it dads who are n't there because of divorce ? Dads who never have been there ? Dads who are irresponsible in getting women pregnant ? We 're looking at several questions . " <p> One sign of the mounting public concern has been the huge turnouts for the recent Million Man March on Washington and the stadium rallies sponsored by Promise Keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney . <p> Another is the popularity of radio programs put together by Colorado Springs-based Focus on the Family . Still another is the proliferation of couples ministries offered in mainstream churches , mentoring programs sponsored by businesses , and teen parenting classes in high schools . <p> " There 's such an effervescence of things . Even McDonald 's has a family thing - McFamily . It 's on the ' Net , " reports Ian Evison , until recently the coordinator of a Lilly Foundation-funded study of religion , culture and the family at the University of Chicago Divinity School . <p> " Where it 's all leading is unclear , " Evison adds . " But we 're coming to some big decisions about it , and there are going to be struggles , because there 's such raw power behind this issue . Regarding Promise Keepers , for example , is it a good thing that men are taking responsibility , or a bad thing that they 're reasserting traditional roles ? " <p> Blankenhorn , author of the book " Fatherless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue to the fore this year , lists three main wellsprings for the widespread anxiety over the state of the family : <p> Out-of-wedlock births . Some 31 percent of all babies born today are delivered by mothers who have never been married - most of them white women over the age of 20 . <p> Divorces . While this key indicator of family stability has leveled off in recent years and may even be starting to decline slightly , the U.S. divorce rate is still highest in the world . <p> Missing fathers . About 40 percent of all American children will go to bed tonight in homes where their father does not live . <p> " If you look at what was happening to the black family in 1965 , when the Moynihan Report first called attention to ' the deterioration of the fabric of Negro society , ' those numbers are exactly descriptive of what is happening to white families in 1995 , " Blankenhorn points out . <p> " We 've spent 30 years arguing over whether this is good or bad . Marriage has been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more creative , and so on . But that debate is largely over now , because the evidence has been clear - it 's not good . And there 's no difference between Dan Quayle and Bill Clinton on this , " he goes on . <p> " There are plenty of children from intact families who grow up and turn out to be terrible , and plenty who grow up to be terrific . But in general , those who grow up in a household without their fathers present are more at risk for psychological problems , dropping out of school , getting low test scores , having earlier sex experiences , getting divorced later in life , etc . For all the basic issues of identity , character and competence , the studies tell us that if one of the parents is not there , those children are at greater risk . " <p> Maybe so , reply the optimists . But they argue that children are n't necessarily better off in families that stay together when the mother and father are incompatible . Unfortunately , concrete numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kids do experience a loss when the parents decide to break up . But what do they gain if they are in a dysfunctional family for a number of years ? " wonders Henderson , the executive with Family Service America , which promotes National Family Week during Thanksgiving week each year . <p> " Have we as a society become too laissez-faire about divorce ? Maybe . But mandating that people stay together is n't going to solve the problem . Helping people , and supporting them as they meet family challenges , may . " <p> As an example of what can be done , Henderson cites Families Together With Schools , an innovative program in which 10 to 15 families get together for weekly sessions designed to redirect at-risk children , empower their parents and enhance their interaction with schools and community agencies . <p> The program , developed in the late 1980s by a Family Service America affiliate in Madison , Wis. , has resulted in " sustained improvement " in the lives of most of the families involved , Henderson says . It is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities argue that family breakup is merely a symptom of deeper troubles - domestic abuse or alcoholism , for instance - that must be addressed for the overall prospects of families to improve . <p> " It 's hard for me to say that the broken home is the critical factor , because there are so many variables , " says Joy Allen , a clinician with Human Services Inc. in Denver . <p> " You can have a great single-parent family transmitting values more effectively than an intact family where there 's substance abuse or mental illness . " <p> Adds Carolyn Noorbakhsh , a clinician and consultant with an employee assistance program provided by Human Services , " The families I see now are more multiproblem . There may be chemical dependency , some form of abuse , financial concerns , a layoff . " <p> One reason for the change , she suggests , may be that managed care programs are limiting the services or number of therapy sessions covered by insurance , so people are waiting until problems mount up before seeking help . Other people ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D-Colo. , a longtime champion of family issues in Congress , says the stresses created by corporate cutbacks and other changes in the marketplace are aggravated by the business world 's traditional indifference to workers ' personal lives . <p> " Employees are hesitant to talk about family problems at work because they think they are going to look unprofessional , " she says . " If they have to pick up a kid from day care , men say they 're going to get a car repaired ; women say they 're going to a doctor 's appointment . We 're so ' family-friendly ' we force people to lie . " <p> Schroeder says it would n't take much to make the workplace more attuned to family needs . Some California firms , for instance , have provided inexpensive beepers to parents with sick children so they wo n't have to wait by the phone all day in case things at home get worse . Others have instituted flexible hours and paid family leaves . <p> The government , Schroeder contends , could offer tax incentives to employers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full cost of day care as a work-related expense , and subsidize day care for women on welfare . <p> But University of Texas sociologist Norval Glenn doubts that political approaches like changes in tax policies would have much effect on the general pattern of family dissolution . <p> " I think to a large extent it 's a values change that has occurred , " he says . " The idea of a permanent commitment to a lifelong marriage , the willingness of people to sacrifice for children , has declined . The way people organize their lives has changed . " <p> Glenn sees some indications of a turnaround , including the plateauing of the divorce rate and the surge of interest in the role of fathers , as seen in the fact that almost as many preschoolers are now being cared for by stay-at-home fathers as are enrolled in day-care homes and nursery schools . <p> But whatever changes may occur , he suggests , the outcome will probably be seen as " not a return to the family as it used to be , but more a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy Allen , the Denver therapist : <p> " In spite of all the stresses , the families that come in my door give me real hope . There are many , many parents that are really serious about child-rearing , and conscious of the values they want to transmit . ... I do n't know any parent - on welfare , middle-class , biracial or whatever - that does n't want their children to have the best . " <p> IN COLORADO <p> 15 percent of children live in households with no adult male ( age 21 and over ) present <p> Between 1980 and 1990 , there was a 36 percent increase in female-headed households statewide . This was a : <p> 31 percent increase for whites <p> 45 percent increase for African-Americans <p> 65 percent increase for Hispanics <p> 71 percent increase for Asian-Americans <p> 97 percent increase for Native Americans <p> 24 percent of all births are to single women <p> 69 percent of teen births are to single moms <p> The median family income for : <p> Two parents with children - $ 47,987 <p> Male-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
