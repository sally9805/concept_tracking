This is a school day but he is nowhere near the classroom , the box of forty faces looking blank . The longing to be here , standing in the shadow of this old rust-hulk of a structure , is too intense to resist  --  this metropolis of steel and concrete and flaky paint and cropped grass and enormous Chesterfield packs aslant on the scoreboards , a couple of cigarettes jutting from each . <p> Longing on a large scale is what makes history . This is just a kid with a local yearning but he is part of an assembling crowd , anonymous thousands off the buses and trains , people in narrow columns tramping over the swing bridge above the river , and even if they are not a migration or a revolution , some vast shaking of the soul , they bring with them the body heat of a great city and their own small reveries and desperations , the unseen something that haunts the day  --  men in fedoras and sailors on shore leave , the stray tumble of their thoughts , going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the roily gray of sliding surf . <p> He is standing at the curbstone waiting to make the mad rush . He is the youngest , at fourteen . Why are these boys in American chronicles always fourteen ? He has never done this before and he does n't know any of the others and only two or three of them seem to know each other but they ca n't do this thing singly or in pairs so they have found one another by means of slidy looks that detect the fellow foolhard and here they stand , black kids and white kids up from the subways or off the local streets , lean shadows , banditos , fifteen in all , and according to topical legend maybe four will get through for every one that 's caught . <p> They are waiting nervously for the ticket holders to clear the turnstiles , the last loose cluster of fans , the stragglers and loiterers . They watch the late-arriving taxis from downtown and the brilliantined men stepping dapper to the windows , policy bankers and club owners secure in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished and pristine . They watch garment bosses and Broadway sharpies and a couple of dumpy men clambering out of a powder blue Cadillac , picking lint off their mohair sleeves . They stand at the curb and watch without seeming to look , wearing the sourish air of corner hangabouts . All the hubbub has died down , the pregame babble and swirl , vendors working the jammed sidewalks waving scorecards and pennants and calling out in ancient singsong , chicken-neck men hustling buttons and caps , all dispersed now , gone to their roomlets in the beaten streets . <p> They are at the curbstone , waiting . Their eyes are going grim , sending out less light . Somebody takes his hands out of his pockets . They are waiting and then they go , one of them goes , a mick who shouts Geronimo . <p> There are four turnstiles just beyond the pair of ticket booths . The youngest boy is also the scrawniest , Cotter Martin by name  --  scrawny tall in a polo shirt and dungarees , and maybe the scaredest too , located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the others . You shout because it makes you brave or you want to announce your recklessness . They have made their faces into scream masks , tight-eyed , with stretchable mouths , and they are running hard , trying to funnel themselves through the lanes between the booths , and they bump hips and elbows and keep the shout going . The faces of the ticket sellers hang behind the windows like onions on strings . <p> Cotter sees the first jumpers go over the bars . Two of them jostle in the air and come down twisted and asprawl . A ticket taker puts a headlock on one of them and his cap comes loose and skims down his back and he reaches for it with a blind swipe and at the same time  --  everything 's at the same time  --  he eyes the other hurdlers to keep from getting stepped on . They are running and hurdling . It 's a witless form of flight with bodies packed in close and the gate-crashing becoming real . They are jumping too soon or too late and hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's back , and what kind of stupes must they look like to people at the hot-dog stand on the other side of the turnstiles , what kind of awful screwups  --  a line of mostly men beginning to glance this way , jaws working at the sweaty meat and grease bubbles flurrying on their tongues , the gent at the far end hanging a dubious look and going dead-still except for a hand that produces automatic movement , swabbing on mustard with a brush . <p> The shout of the motley boys comes banging off the deep concrete . <p> Cotter thinks he sees a path to the turnstile on the right . He drains himself of everything he does not need to make the jump . Some are still jumping , some are thinking about it , some need a haircut , some have girlfriends with swinging breasts , and the rest have landed in the ruck and are trying to get up and scatter . You have a sheepish panic here , kids with pink smirks . A couple of real-live cops are rumbling down the ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand waves of information hitting on his skin . His gaze is trained on the iron bar projected from the post . He picks up speed and seems to lose his gangliness , the slouchy funk of hormones and unbelonging and all the dumb-hearted things that seal his adolescence . He is just a running boy , a half-seen figure from the streets , but the way running reveals some clue to being , the way a runner bares himself to self-examination , this is how the easy-gaiting kid seems to open to the world , how the blood-rush of a dozen strides brings him into eloquence . <p> Then he leaves his feet and is in the air , feeling sleek and unmussed and sort of glass-surfaced , flying in light , white-eyed , and in one prolonged molecular second he sees precisely where he 'll land and which way he 'll run , and even though he knows they will be after him the moment he touches ground , even though he 'll be in danger for the next several hours , watching left and right  --  bespectacled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trumaine Martin , dead at twenty-six of being in a room that contained a discharging pistol  --  there is less fear in him now . His head is tucked , his left leg is clearing the bar . Bystanders saying What-the-hey . He comes down lightly and runs past the ticket taker groping for his fallen cap and he knows absolutely  --  knows it all the way , deep as knowing goes , he feels the knowledge start to hammer in his runner 's heart  --  that he is uncatchable . <p> Here comes a cop in municipal bulk with a gun and cuffs and a flashlight and a billy club all jigging on his belt and a summons pad wadded in his pocket . His arms are rising slowly from his sides , a happy dazzle in his eyes . Cotter gives him a juke step that sends him nearly to his knees and the hot dog eaters bend from the waist to watch the kid veer away in soft acceleration , showing the cop a little finger-wag bye-bye . <p> He surprises himself this way every so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere . <p> He runs up a shadowed ramp and into a crossweave of girders and pillars and spilling light . He hears the crescendoing last chords of the national anthem and sees the great open horseshoe of the grandstand and that unfolding vision of the grass that always seems to mean he has stepped outside his life  --  the rubbed shine that sweeps and bends from the raked dirt of the infield out to the high green fences . It is the excitement of a revealed thing . He runs at quarter speed , craning to see the rows of seats , looking for an inconspicuous wedge behind a pillar . He cuts into an aisle in Section 35 and walks down into the heat and smell of the massed fans , he walks into the smoke that hangs from the underside of the second deck , he hears the talk , he enters the deep buzz , he hears the warmup pitches crack into the catcher 's mitt , a series of reports that carry a comet 's tail of secondary sound . <p> Then we lose him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the crowd . Looks like thirty-five thousand and how do you figure it . When you think about the textured histories of the teams and the faith and passion of the fans and the way these forces are entwined citywide , and when you think about the game itself , live-or-die , the third game in a three-game playoff , and you say the names Giants and Dodgers , and you calculate the way the players hate each other openly , and you recall the kind of year this has turned out to be , the pennant race that has brought the city to a strangulated rapture , an end-shudder requiring a German loanword to put across the mingling of pleasure and dread and suspense , the fatalism that sighs through the long rivalry and the soul 's melodious hope twisted by bitterness , and when you think about the blood loyalty , this is what they 're saying in the booth  --  the love-of-team that runs across the boroughs and through the snuggled suburbs and out into the apple counties and the raw north , then how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " All day it looks like rain . It affects the mood . People say the hell with it . " <p> The producer is hanging a blanket across the booth to separate the crew from the guys who 've just arrived from KMOX in St. Louis . Have to double up since there 's nowhere else to put them . <p> He says to the engineer , " Do n't forget . There was n't any advance sale . " <p> And the engineer says , " Plus the Giants lost big yesterday and this is a serious thing because a crushing defeat puts a gloom on the neighborhoods . Believe me , I know this where I live . It 's demoralizing for people . It 's like they 're dying in the tens of thousands . " The engineer does a flourish of the hand . It is broad and Roman , a flat hand moving parallel to the earth as a gesture of burial or a way of writing finis to something significant . " So they stay home the next day and they hunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could also be the expectation of a sellout that keeps people from showing . If you could ever expect a sellout , " the producer says , " today 's the day . But where are they ? " <p> " I just gave you two good reasons for where they are . " <p> " I 'm saying the crowd that does n't come keeps the real crowd down . " <p> Engineer says , " Now you 're getting us into things I 'd just as soon avoid . " <p> Russ Hodges , who broadcasts the games for WMCA , he is the voice of the Giants  --  Russ has an overworked larynx and the makings of a major cold and he should n't be lighting up a cigarette but here he goes , saying , " That 's all well and good but I 'm not sure there really is a logical explanation . When you deal with crowds , nothing 's predictable . " <p> Russ is going jowly now but there are elements of the uncomplicated boy in his eyes and smile and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might belong to almost anyone . Can you do games , can you do play-by-play almost every day through a deep summer and not be located in some version of the past ? And there 's the grits-and-tater voice that Russ has never tried to alter , the homey ramble of the water boy for the college football team back , that was , in some Kentucky town when all the time and space he could imagine were equal to a playing field , some patch of striped earth bounded by plank seats . <p> He says , " Al knows this . Al , am I right ? Sometimes you get a feeling on a warm evening , say about mid-June . It 's not a big game or an old rivalry but you feel something gathering in the air and sure enough they start pouring off the subways and trailing up Eighth Avenue and coming down the stairs from the bluff and they fill the place completely . It 's a contagious thing that moves through the city . And today it 's just the reverse . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . " <p> The engineer is trading raunchy talk with the crew on the other side of the blanket and barely listens to this . <p> Al , the producer , says , " It 's been an off year for crowds , come to think of it . All year really . And in a lot of cities . " <p> Two days of iron skies in Boston and all the mike time of the past week , the sore throat , the coughing , Russ is feverish and bedraggled  --  train trips and nerves and no sleep . He looks out at the field with its cramped comers and the overcompensating spaces of the deep alleys and dead center . The big square Longines clock that juts up from the clubhouse . Strokes of color all around , a frescoing of hats and faces and the green grandstand and tawny base paths . Russ feels lucky to be here . Day of days and he 's doing the game and it 's happening at the Polo Grounds  --  a name he loves , a precious echo carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have grown uncertain . He thinks everybody who 's here ought to feel lucky because something big 's in the works , something 's building . Okay , maybe just his temperature . But he finds himself thinking of the time his father took him to see Dempsey fight Willard in Toledo and what a thing that was , what a measure of the awesome , the Fourth of July and a hundred and ten degrees and a crowd of shirt-sleeved men in straw hats , many wearing handkerchiefs spread beneath their hats and down to their shoulders , making them look like play-Arabs , and the greatness of the beating big Jess took in that white hot ring , the way the sweat and blood came misting off his face every time Dempsey hit him . <p> When yon see a thing like that , a thing that becomes a newsreel , you begin to feel you are a carrier of some profound sort of history . <p> In the second inning Thomson hits a slider on a line over third . <p> Lockman swings into an arc as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Pafko moves to the wall to play the carom . <p> People stand in both decks in left , leaning out from the rows up front , and some of them are tossing paper over the edge , torn-up scorecards and bits of matchbook covers , there are crushed paper cups , little waxy napkins they got with their hot dogs , there are germ-bearing tissues many days old that were matted at the bottoms of deep pockets , all coming down around Pafko . <p> Thomson is loping along , he is striding nicely around first , leaning into his run . <p> Pafko throws smartly to Cox . <p> Thomson moves head-down toward second , coasting in , and then sees Lockman standing on the bag looking at him semi-spellbound , the trace of a query hanging on his lips . <p> This is the first time Pafko has come near the wall and it rouses the crowd . He belongs to the other side , meaning not only the other team but the side away from the wall , far from the wall , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make him disappear . <p> Cox peers out from under his cap and snaps the ball sidearm to Robinson . <p> Other people simply staring , not watching the throw or the runners or anything that 's happening in the infield . They only want a look at Pafko 's actual face . <p> Mays is walking toward the plate , dragging the barrel of his bat on the ground . <p> Robinson takes the throw and makes a spin move toward Thomson , who is standing shyly maybe five feet from second . <p> They like to see the paper fall at Pafko 's feet , maybe drift across his shoulder or cling to his cap . The wall is nearly seventeen feet high , so he is well out of range of the longest leaning touch and they have to be content to bathe him in their paper . <p> On the dugout steps Durocher leans his elbow on his knee , hard-guy Leo , the gashouse scrapper , and he says into his fist , " Holy fuggin ' shit almighty . " <p> Near the Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice box when Robinson slaps the tag on Thomson . They are three-quarters show biz , Frank Sinatra , Jackie Gleason , and Toots Shor , drinking buddies from way back , and they 're accompanied by a well-dressed man with a bulldog mug , one J. Edgar Hoover . What 's the nation 's number one G-man doing with these crumbums ? Well , Edgar is sitting in the aisle seat and he seems to be doing just fine , smiling at the rude banter that rolls nonstop from crooner to jokesmith to saloonkeeper and back . He would rather be at the racetrack but is cheerful enough in this kind of company , whatever the venue . He likes to be around movie idols and celebrity athletes , around gossip-meisters like Walter Winchell , who is also at the game today , sitting with the Dodger brass . Fame and secrecy are the high and low ends of the same fascination and Edgar ca n't resist the forms of energy that spin abundantly around you , the silky crackle of static fields . He is a fan at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hidden life is in his private files , all the rumors collected and indexed , the lost facts emergent . <p> Gleason says , " I told you chumps , it 's all Dodgers today . I feel it in my Brooklyn bones . " <p> " Bones ? What bones ? " Frank says . " They 're rotted out by booze . " <p> Thomson 's whole body sags , it loses vigor and resistance , and Robinson calls time and walks the ball to the mound in the pigeon-toed gait that makes his path seem crooked . <p> " The Giants 'll have to hire that midget if they want to win , what's-his-name , because their only hope is some freak of nature , " Gleason says . <p> Jackie has a beer in one hand and a cigarette held high in the other . He whirls about when he speaks , drawing in listeners . He is a rare fellow , the agile fat man , and Edgar thinks this makes him dangerous . He has Gleason directly to his left and ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks in his seat . Edgar 's suits are custom-tailored , he has this Italian who comes to his hotel whenever he 's in New York , and he has been trying most of the day to stay clear of Gleason 's epic gesturing  --  from early lunch at Shor 's place and throughout the limousine ride when Jackie kept on belting scotches and tapping long ash at the folded jump seat and ramming sandwiches into the side of his mouth , and here he is even now hailing the hot dog man , who comes down the steps half-bent , an old scrag softly moaning his song . <p> " An earthquake or a midget , " Gleason says . " And since this ai n't California , you better pray for a midget . " <p> Frank says , " Funnee . " <p> Edgar does n't like hearing the word " midget . " He is sensitive about his height even though he is safely in the middle range . He has added weight in recent years and when he sees himself in the mirror getting dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looks back at him . This is something he fears more than something he is . This is something that was once true  --  he was Mother Hoover 's cuddled runt  --  but as his body changed over time the presence remained intact , the shadow demon of his shortness . Finally it is something the yammerheads in the press have reported to be true , as if a man can wish his phantom torment into public print . And today it 's a fact that taller-than-average agents are not likely to be assigned to headquarters . And it 's a further fact that the midget our pal Gleason is talking about , the three-foot-seven-inch sportif who came to bat one time for the St. Louis Browns some six weeks ago in a moment , Edgar believes , of nihilistic theater  --  this fellow is Eddie Gaedel and if Gleason recalls the name it will be the merest instant before he connects Eddie with Edgar and then the short-man jokes will begin to fly like the storied shit that hits the fan . Gleason got his start doing insult comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager table comic  --  does it for free , does it for fun , and leaves shattered lives behind . This is the danger that Edgar confronts when he associates with boozers and lampooners . <p> Toots Shor says , " Do n't be a shlump all your life , Gleason . It 's only 1-zip . And the Giants did n't come from thirteen and a half games back just to blow it on the last day . This is the miracle year . Nobody could make a vocabulary for how this team came back . " <p> The slab face and meatcutter 's hands . You look at Toots and see a speakeasy vet , dense of body , with slicked-back hair and a set of chinky eyes that summon up a warning in a hurry . This is an ex-bouncer who throws innocent people out of his club when he is drinking . <p> He says , " Mays is the man . " <p> And Frank says , " This is Willie 's day . He 's due to bust loose . Leo told me on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " You 're not actually telling me that this fellow stepping up to the wicket is going to do something extraordinary . " <p> Edgar , who hates the fucking English , falls forward laughing even as Jackie takes a breathless bite of his frank and begins to cough and choke , sending quidbits of meat and bread in many directions , pellets and smithereens , spitball flybys . <p> Edgar turns at once , facing away from Gleason . He is dismayed at the thought of unseeable lifeforms approaching his clothing and skin . He wants to hurry to a lavatory , a zinc-lined room with a bar of untouched oval soap , a torrent of hot water and a swansdown towel that has never been used by anyone else . But of course there is nothing of the kind nearby . Just more germs , an all-pervading medium of pathogens , microbes , floating colonies of spirochetes that fuse and separate and elongate and spiral and engulf , the trainloads of matter that people cough forth , rudimentary and deadly . <p> That 's it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the microstuff of life , the more clearly you sense the lethal weave of the material world . <p> It is all around us , waiting to happen . <p> The constant noise of the crowd , the breath and hum , a basso rumble building now and then , the genderness of what they share in their experience of the game or how a man will scratch his wrist or shape a line of swearwords . And the lapping of applause that dies down quickly and is never enough . They are waiting to be carried on the sound of rally chant and rhythmic handclap , the set forms and repetitions . This is the power they keep in reserve for the right time . It is the monotone that will make something happen , change the structure of the game and get them leaping to their feet , flying up together in a free thunder that shakes the place crazy . <p> Sinatra saying , " Jack , I thought I told you to stay in the car until you 're all done eating . " <p> Mays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending a routine fly into the low October day . The sound of the ash bat making contact with the ball reaches Cotter Martin in the left-field stands , where he sits in a bony-shouldered hunch . He is watching Willie instead of the ball , seeing him sort of shrug-run around first and then scoop his glove off the turf and jog out to his position . <p> The arc lights come on , catching Cotter by surprise , causing a shift in the way he feels , in the freshness of his escapade , the airy flash of doing it and not getting caught and sitting here looking out from inside , being sure of who he is because no one else exactly knows . And telling the daring tale in his head to schoolkids waiting for the bell . This lightness and silence he 's been sitting in , the transparent secret that lives in his chest , all this suddenly gone . The day is different now , grave and threatened , rain-hurried , and he realizes how quick the end could come . Giants fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss as heavens open . This is a thing he had n't thought about . He watches Mays standing in center field looking banty in all that space , completely kid-size , and he wonders how the guy can make those throws he makes , whirl and sling , with power . He likes looking at the field under lights even if he has to worry about rain and even if it 's only afternoon and the full effect is not the same as in a night game , when the field and the players seem completely separate from the night around them . He has been to one night game in his life and it was something he thought about and prepared for , built up to over many weeks , and he still thinks about it when he lies in bed sometimes , a brightness pushing past the ordinary flood of color , something better than any preparation could cause him to expect . He came down from the bluff , walking into a bowl of painted light . He thought there was an unknown energy flaring down out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , and it isolated the players and the grass and the chalkrolled lines from anything he 'd ever seen or imagined . They had the glow of first-time things . He was a brain-soft twelve at the time and maybe too excited and maybe not . But he knows , because he 's heard the stories from his father , that in the war they did not play at night so that enemy spies could not use the lights to locate major targets . This makes the lighting of a ballpark seem a business of the most special and delicate kind . <p> The way the runner skid-brakes when he makes the turn at first . <p> The empty seats were the first surprise , well before the lights . On his prowl through the stands he kept seeing blank seats and thought this is a case of the rightful owner off buying a beer or taking a leak but then he realized it made no sense for so many people to be doing petty things at the start of a crucial game , quibbling with their bladder and whatnot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of striped-tie men who probably slunk out of the office pleading parrot fever . Of course he is flat broke , busted  --  do n't have a sou , he has heard people say  --  and he 's still trying to accept his good luck , the well-being and ease of a seat , without failing into dark suspicion . <p> The man to his left says , " How about some peanuts hey ? " <p> Peanut vendor 's coming through again , a coin-catching wiz about eighteen , black and rangy . People know him from games past and innings gone and they quicken up and dig for change . They 're calling out for peanuts , hey , here , yo , and tossing coins with thumb flicks and discus arcs and in every known manner of hurled projectile , and the vendor 's hands seem to inhale the flying metal . He is magnet-skinned , snatching backhand and off his ear and between his dang legs . People cheering him on and peanut bags sailing left and right . The guy is Mr. Everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then airmails the peanuts to them chesthigh . It 's a thrill-a-minute show but Cotter feels an obscure danger here . The guy is making him visible , shaming him in his prowler 's den . Is n't it strange how their common color jumps the space between them ? Nobody saw Cotter until the vendor appeared , black rays phasing from his hands . One popular Negro and crowd pleaser . One shifty kid trying not to be noticed . <p> The man says , " What do you say ? " <p> Cotter raises a hand no . <p> " Care for a bag ? Come on . " <p> Cotter leans away , the hand going to his midsection to mean he 's already eaten or peanuts give him cramps or his mother told him not to fill up on trashy food that will ruin his dinner . <p> The man says , " Who 's your team then ? " <p> " Giants . " <p> " What a year hey ? " <p> " This weather , I do n't know , it 's bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . He 's about forty , close-shaved and Brylcreemed , with a baby pinkness that Cotter links to clean living . <p> " Only 1-0 . They 'll come back . The kind of year it 's been , it ca n't end with a little weather . How about a soda ? " <p> Men passing in and out of the toilets , men zipping their flies as they turn from the trough , and other men approaching the long receptacle , thinking where they want to stand and next to whom and not next to whom , and the old ballpark 's reek and mold are consolidated here , generational tides of beer and shit and cigarettes and peanut shells and disinfectants and pisses in the untold millions , and they are thinking in the ordinary way that helps a person glide through a life , thinking thoughts unconnected to events , the dusty hum of who you are , men shouldering through the traffic in the men 's room as the game goes on , the coming and going , the lifting out of dicks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seat and speaks to Cotter from off his shoulder , using a crafty whisper . " What about school ? Having a private holiday ? " Letting a grin slide across his face . <p> Cotter says , " Same as you , " and gets a gunshot laugh . <p> " I 'd a broken out of prison to see this game . Matter of fact , they 're broadcasting to prisoners . They put radios in cellblocks in the city jails . " <p> " I was here early , " Cotter says . " I could have gone to school in the morning and then cut out . But I wanted to see everything . " <p> " A real fan . Music to my ears . " <p> " See the people showing up . " <p> " My name 's Bill Waterson , by the way . And I 'd a gladly gone AWOL from the office but I did n't actually have to . Got my own little business . Architectural firm . " <p> Cotter tries to think of something to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses that are fun to live in . " <p> Peanut vendor 's on his way up the aisle and headed over to the next section when he spots Cotter and drops a knowing smile . Of course the kid thinks here comes trouble . This gatemouth is out to expose him in some withering way . In other words how 'd you get in here , four eyes , with all the ticket-buying folks . Their glances briefly meet as the vendor moves up the stairs . In full stride and double-quick he dips his hand for a bag of peanuts and zings it nonchalant to Cotter , who makes the grab in a one-hand blur that matches the hazy outline of the toss . And it is one sweetheart of a moment , making Cotter crack the smile of the week and sending a wave of goodwill through the area . <p> " Guess you got one after all , " says Bill Waterson . <p> Cotter unrolls the pleated top of the brown bag and extends it to Bill . They sit there shelling the peanuts and rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and index finger and eating the oily salty flesh and dropping the husks on the ground without ever taking their eyes off the game . <p> Bill says , " Next time you hear somebody say they 're in seventh heaven , think of this . " <p> " All we need is some runs . " He pushes the bag at Bill once more . <p> " They 'll score . It 's coming . Newcombe 's overworked . They 've been working him like a dray horse . Watch him lift his arms every ten or twelve pitches . He 's raising his arms way over his head . That 's year-end fatigue . That 's too much pitching down the stretch . Do n't worry . We 'll make you happy you did n't go to school today . " <p> Robinson stands at the edge of the outfield grass watching the hitter step in and he is thinking idly , Another one of Leo 's sheepfucking country-boy krauts . <p> Cotter did n't skip school knowing he 'd be rushing the turnstiles with a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of event , that 's all . On such a day of truth it was high prosperity for him to stand outside the ballpark and let the scene breathe its sidewalk heat and noise all over his face . He had it all worked out , one to four . First you get to the park early enough to stand by the clubhouse entrance and watch the players go in , hatless and mortal men just out of their cars and wearing shirts pressed by a wife or a mother , carrying traces of your own enfolded world , a place they remarkably share . Then you watch the ticket holders shuffle toward the gates in narrow numbers at first and then in marching swarms , all tuned to the rhythm of each other 's movement , quick-walking , every kind of face and shape  --  this is interesting to see . Then you hustle on down to a Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street , you go flat out , it is a test of speed and car-dodging skills , and you do n't stop until you reach the Davega store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Black Daylite by General Electric . Then you ease and wheedle and worm your way into the shifting cluster of forty other deadheads standing in front of the window watching the game . <p> " Now there 's a law of manly conduct , " Bill says . " And it states that since you 're sharing your peanuts with me , I 'm duty-bound to buy us both some soda pop . " <p> " That sounds fair enough . " <p> " Good . It 's settled then . " Turning in his seat and flinging up an arm . " A couple of sportsmen taking their ease . " <p> But he never got past number two . When he saw that ragtag pack in torn sneakers smoking their Luckies to the minimum butt and slouched a certain way , sort of vulture-winged , he thought he might attach himself . Because anytime you see black and white together you know they are joined in some effort of betterment . Says so in the Constitution . They had to be readying for a crash and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are always people rushing the gates to get inside some place that 's closed to them . It happened right here weeks ago when they climbed the grillwork , grown men scaling the walls to see Sugar Ray take back his title . One minute you needed a ticket , then you blinked and it was holy hell . Grown men teeming toward ringside to occupy the thirty-dollar seats and who could stop them in the numbers they comprised ? <p> These are the stories people tell , legends of the common streets . <p> Stanky the pug sitting in the dugout . Mays trying to get a jingle out of his head , his bluesy face slightly puffed , some razorblade thing he 's been hearing on the radio lately . The batboy comes down the steps a little daydreamy , sliding Dark 's black bat into the rack . The game turns inward in the middle innings . They fall into waiting , into some unshaped anxiety that stiffens the shoulder muscles and sends them to the water cooler to drink and spit . <p> Across the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with pointy elfin ears , tight-armed and throwing easily , just getting loose . <p> Mays thinking helplessly , Push-pull , click-click , change blades that quick . <p> In the stands Special Agent Rafferty is walking down the stairs to the box-seat area behind the home-team dugout . He is a thickset man with a mass of reddish hair  --  a shock of red hair , people like to say  --  and he is moving with the straight-ahead look of someone who does n't want to be distracted . He is moving briskly but not urgently , headed toward the box occupied by the Director . <p> Gleason has two sudsy cups planted at his feet and there 's a hot dog he has forgotten about that 's bulging out at each end of his squeezed fist . He is talking to six people at once and they are laughing and asking questions , season boxholders , some old-line fans with their spindly wives . They see he is half-swacked and they admire the clarity of his wit , the fine edge of insult and derision . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie 's happy to do it , bypassing his own boozy state to do a detailed imitation of a drunk . He goes heavy-lidded and growly , making sport of one man 's ragmop toupee , ridiculing a second for the elbow patches on his tweed jacket . The women enjoy it enormously but they want more . They want him to go all the way , say everything , do their own spent marriages . It is innocent on one level and deeply malicious and truthful and revealing on another . They watch Gleason , they look at Sinatra for his reaction to Gleason , they watch the game , they listen to Jackie do a brief turn as Ralph Kramden , they watch the mustard slide down his thumb and they feel too shy to tell him . <p> When Rafferty reaches Mr. Hoover 's aisle seat he does not stand over the Director and lean down to address him . He makes it a point to crouch in the aisle . His hand is set casually near his mouth so that no one else can make out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says something to his companions . Then he and Rafferty walk up the stairs and find an isolated spot midway down a long ramp , where the special agent recites the details of his message . <p> It seems the Soviet Union has conducted an atomic test at a secret location somewhere inside its own borders . They have exploded a bomb in plain unpretending language . And our detection devices indicate this is clearly what it is  --  it is a bomb , a weapon , it is an instrument of conflict , it produces heat and blast . It is not some peaceful use of atomic energy . <p> Hoover knows this is not completely unexpected . It is their second atomic explosion . But the news is hard , it works into him , makes him think of the spies who passed the secrets , makes him think of atomic weapons being sent to Communist forces in Korea . And even if he knows they have not had a record of completely steady success , he feels them moving ever closer , catching up , overtaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands here , drawing the skin tighter across his face , sealing his gaze . <p> Rafferty is standing on the part of the ramp that is downhill from Mr. Hoover . <p> The crowd noise breaks above them , a chambered voice rolling through the hollows in the underbody of the stadium . Edgar feels a memory begin to resonate . He was in New York that Sunday , it was just under ten years ago , here for the weekend , two-thirty in the afternoon , that Sunday the seventh , when Pearl Harbor was bombed . Officials being paged at football games , dashing for cabs , for seats on airplanes , and the news seemed to shimmer in the air , everything in photoflash , plain objects hot and charged . And Edgar hurrying from lunch to the New York office to listen on a shortwave hookup to the sound of bombs striking our ships in the harbor . He stands in this concrete place and feels the slow pulse of that office on a Sunday , he can smell the leather corners of the desk blotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemptied , and there 's a voice distinctly saying Listen , saying It 's war , and then the long bursts of static and the sea-spouting bombs and the voice counting off the detonations so you can tell the bombs from the random noise , another and another and that 's another and smoke and ship and listen . <p> Now this , he thinks . The sun 's own heat that swallows cities . <p> Ralph Kramden is a new Gleason character , a bus driver who lives with his wife , Alice , in a bare Brooklyn flat . People want to hear Jackie do a little more Kramden . This is making Sinatra uneasy , all these people lapping at their seat backs . He is used to ritual distances . He wants to encounter people in circumstances laid out beforehand . Frank does n't have his dago secret service with him today . And even with Jackie on one flank and Toots on the other  --  a couple of porcos who function as natural barriers  --  people keep pressing in , showing a sense of mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to him . The way his career 's been going , he wonders why . But this is a thing they have to do , speak across the shore to the pinwheel vision on the other side . And the rigid grins floating near . And the way they use him as a reference not only for Gleason 's routines but for the game itself . Somebody makes a nice play , they look at Frank to see how he reacts . Or a fan trips on the steps , scraping his hand , and they look at Frank to see if he has noticed . <p> He leans over and says , " Jack , it 's a great boot being here but you think you can put a towel over your head so these people can go back to watching the game ? " <p> People want Gleason to do familiar lines of dialogue from the show . They 're calling out the lines they want him to do . <p> Then Frank says , " Where the hell is Edgar , by the way ? We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The catcher works up out of his squat , dirt impacted in the creases that run across the back of his ruddled neck . He lifts his mask so he can spit . He is padded and bumpered , lips rough and scored and sun-flaked . This is the freest thing he does , spitting in public . His saliva bunches and wobbles when it hits the dirt , going sandy brown . <p> Russ Hodges is over on the TV side for the middle innings , talking less , guided by the action on the monitor . Between innings the statistician offers him part of a chicken sandwich he has brought along for lunch . <p> He says to Russ , " What 's the wistful look today ? " <p> " I did n't know I had a look . Any look . I do n't feel capable of a look . Maybe hollow-eyed . " <p> " Pensive , " says the statman . <p> And it 's true and he knows it , Russ is wistful and drifting and this is so damn odd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilting back , an old creaky easing back , as of a gray-haired man in a rocker . <p> " This is chicken with what ? " <p> " I 'm guessing mayonnaise . " <p> " It 's funny , you know , " Russ says , " but I think it was Charlotte put the look in my face . " <p> " The lady or the city ? " <p> " Definitely the city . I spent years in a studio doing re-creations of big league games . The telegraph bug clacking in the background and blabbermouth Hodges inventing ninety-nine percent of the action . And I 'll tell you something , scout 's honor . I know this sounds farfetched but I used to sit there and dream of doing real baseball from a booth in the Polo Grounds in New York . " <p> " Real baseball . " <p> " The thing that happens in the sun . " <p> So maybe it 's not so odd after all , this reflective mood . Russ has reached a sort of culmination , this is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only natural for him to wonder how he got to be sitting here , in a television-blue shirt , careful not to talk too much . <p> " That 's not a bush curve Maglie 's throwing , " he says into the mike . <p> Somebody hands you a piece of paper filled with letters and numbers and you have to make a ball game out of it . You create the weather , flesh out the players , you make them sweat and grouse and hitch up their pants . You construct the fiction of a distant city , making up everything but the stark facts of the evolving game . Now the umpire 's dusting off the plate . Some wispy clouds hanging in the west  --  you are sitting in a windowless room , remember , with an oil company calendar on the wall  --  cirrus or stratus maybe , you are quick to admit you are n't sure , and Vernon knocks the dirt from his spikes and says something to the lanky veteran catcher , a son of the Old South is Bill Dickey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make time ( as with a girl ) , you talk out the time in your small-town baritone . Then the operator receives the next Morse-coded message , which he transcribes on the typewriter into standard baseball cryptic , and you must interpret and embellish once again , using every property and quality that distinguishes living individuals from symbols on a page , and it is remarkable , thinks Russ , how much earthly disturbance , how much summer and dust the mind can manage to order up from a single Latin letter lying flat . <p> He puts the last bite of sandwich in his mouth and licks his thumb and remembers he 's alive . <p> Back in Charlotte doing ghost games he liked to take the action into the stands , getting the fans involved  --  people bestirring themselves to chase a foul ball , scrabbling under seats , and always it 's a kid who comes up with the ball , towheaded or freckle-faced , and why not ? If you 're going to make a moment , give it a lilt , a lucky bounce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy with a cowlick ( shameless , ai n't I ) and he holds the ball aloft and then throws it back on the field , thank you very much , because there 's a war going on and we need to save every scrap and snip and thingamajig . <p> In this half-hell of desperate invention he did four years of Senators ' baseball without ever seeing them play . <p> And it is fitting , it is fair and just that the baseball does not end up in some dustwebbed corner of a closet while the winsome kid grows up and marries and moves away , abandoning a major emblem of remembrance  --  this five-ounce sphere of cork , rubber , yarn , horsehide , and spiral stitching eventually reduced to common garbage , thrown out with the shoe trees and aspirin bottles . <p> Over on the radio side the producer 's saying , " See that thing in the paper last week about Einstein ? " <p> Engineer says , " What Einstein ? " <p> " Albert , with the hair . Some reporter asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , one team wins so many of their remaining games , the other team wins this number or that number . What are the myriad possibilities ? Who 's got the edge ? " <p> " The fuck does he know ? " <p> " Apparently not much . He picked the Dodgers to eliminate the Giants last Friday . " <p> The engineer wings some four-letter words through the blanket at his counterpart from KMOX . The novelty of the blanket has made these men want to talk to each other . They are becoming forcefully obscene , it is a game , a competition . The technical men have control of scene material because it 's all about specialized skills , is n't it ? Not just dick dimensions and fancy fucking but how to say the words . When the wrong person uses profanity , it makes everybody feel bad . The technicians have street sense , an ear for staccato consonants , for the kind of repetition that breaks down meaning and becomes a cooked-up rhythm , the double scat of jazz and shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , they 're doing blackvoice now , a couple of reefer Negroes in the fumy murmurs of some cellar room . The producer gets them to stop but after a while they 're at it again . Not loud enough to be picked up on mike of course . Just an ambient noise like some sleepy player 's dugout buzz  --  a patter , a texture , an extension of the game . <p> Down in the field boxes they want Gleason to say , " One of these days , Alice  --  pow  --  right to the moon . " <p> Russ makes his way back to the radio side after the Giants go down in their half of the sixth still trailing by a run . He 's glad he does n't have a thermometer because he might be tempted to use it and that would be demoralizing . It 's a mild day , glory be , and the rain 's holding off . <p> Producer says , " Going to the wire , Russ . " <p> " I hope I do n't close down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " This is radio , buddy . Ca n't close down . Think of what 's out there . They are hugging their little portables . " <p> " You 're not making me feel any better . " <p> " They are goddamn crouched over the wireless . You 're like Murrow from London . " <p> " Thank you , Al . " <p> " Save the voice . " <p> " I am trying mightily . " <p> " This game is everywhere . Dow Jones tickers are rapping out the score with the stock averages . Every bar in town , I guarantee . They 're smuggling radios into boardrooms . At Schrafft 's I hear they 're breaking into the Muzak to give the score . " <p> " All those nice ladies with their matched sweater sets and genteel sandwiches . " <p> " Save the voice , " Al says . <p> " Do they have tea with honey on the menu ? " <p> " They 're eating and drinking baseball . The track announcer at Belmont 's doing updates between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . They got it in jail . They got it in taxicabs and barbershops . " <p> Speed of the thrown ball coming at your head . This son of a buck can bring it . Infielders leaning , backs curved and heads set high . Hitter fidgeting in the box . Everybody waiting on the pitcher , he 's a faceful of boding , his upper body drawn forward , glove hand dangled at the knee . He 's reading and reading the sign . He 's reading the sign . He wants to freeze you to the spot so he can sink his fastball in your waxy ear . They 're all looking hard , straining in , watching the hitter , waiting , seeing him step out  --  it 's his turn now and he steps out and squeezes the bat handle and rolls his shoulders and aims a half-swing and extends his arms with the bat straight up and reaches down to hoist his balls and steps in again and digs a pit with his back foot and makes the dust boil up and then gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baleful stare . <p> The shortstop moves his feet to break the trance of waiting . <p> Everything happening now comes down to us through common law . It is the rule of confrontation , well-established and faithfully maintained , written across the face of every slackwit pitcher since the days when there were teams named the Superbas and the Bride-grooms . The difference comes when the ball is hit . Then nothing is the same . The men are moving , coming out of their crouches , blood pumping , tendons stretched in the soft moist air . The forms and orders all submit to the pebble-skip of the ball , to rotations and backspins and airstreams . There are drag coefficients . There are trailing vortices . The energy of the ball is proportional to the square of the velocity . There are things that happen only once , muscle memory and jots of dust , the narrative that lives in the spaces of the official play-by-play . <p> And the crowd is also in this lost space , the crowd made over in that one-thousandth of a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rustle of murmurs and curses , people breathing soft moans , their faces changing as the play unrolls across the grassy scan . J. Edgar Hoover stands among them . He is watching from the wide aisle at the head of the ramp . He has told Rafferty he will remain at the game . No purpose served by his leaving . The White House will make the announcement in less than an hour . Edgar hates Harry Truman , he would like to see him writhing on a parquet floor , felled by chest pains , but he can hardly fault the President 's timing . By announcing first , we prevent the Soviets from putting their own sweet spin on the event . And we ease public anxiety to some degree . People will understand that we 've maintained control of the news if not of the bomb . This is no small subject of concern . <p> Edgar looks at the faces around him , open and hopeful . He wants to feel a compatriot 's nearness and affinity . All these people formed by language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell and the cars they drive have never had anything in common so much as this , that they are sitting in the furrow of destruction . He tries to feel a belonging , an unstopping of his old acid soul , but he only has the familiar things , the spite and rage and need to defend and the narrow edge of satisfaction . He is happy at the bottom of it all . There is some bitter injury he has never been able to name and when he encounters a threat from outside , from the moral wane that is everywhere in effect , he finds it is a balance to this damage , a restoring force . His ulcer kicks up of course . But there is that side of him , that part of him that depends on the strength of the enemy . <p> We 're looking at a young man with gaps in both rows of teeth and he 's drinking from a fountain outside a mens room and then shooting water through his teeth in slender jets for the amusement of his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat for the seventh-inning stretch . He says nothing of course . Gleason is shouting down a vendor , trying to order beers . People on their feet , shaking off the tension and fret . A man slowly wiping his glasses . A staring man . A man flexing the stiffness out of his limbs . <p> " Get me a brandy and soda , " Toots says . <p> Jackie tells him , " Do n't be a clamhead all your life . " <p> " Treat the man nice , " Frank says . " He just had his picture taken by that famous photographer . Whosis . The guy who did Churchill . " <p> Toots says , " Karsh of Ottawa if you want his full name . " <p> " Karsh of fucking Ottawa . Exactly , " says Frank . " So do n't begrudge this man a single thing . He 's come a long way for a Jew who drinks . He 's best buddies with political leaders you never even heard of . Every world figure rolls into his joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except Mahatma Gandhi . And him they shot . " <p> Gleason flares his brows and goggles his eyes and shoots out his arms in a nitwit gesture of revelation . <p> " That 's the name I could n't think of . The midget that pinch-hits . " <p> People around them , hearing part of this and reacting mainly to inflection and body slang  --  they 've seen Jackie physically building the remark and they knock together laughing even before he has finished the line , their faces crumpled up , some of them asking others what did he say , speaking through their own laughter so they ca n't be understood . <p> Edgar is also laughing despite the return of the midget business . He admires the rough assurance of these men . It seems to flush from their pores . They have a size to them , a crazy stamina that mocks his own bible-school indoctrination even as it draws him to the noise . He 's a self-perfected American who must respect the saga of the knockabout boy emerging from a tenement culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gusty egos , it makes for appetites . The pussy bandits Jackie and Frank have a showy sort of ease around women . And it 's true about Toots , he knows everybody worth knowing and can drink even Gleason into the carpeting . His place does n't have the swank of the Stork Club in its prime , the bitchy kick Edgar thrives on , but when Toots clamps a sympathetic paw on your shoulder you feel he is some provident force come to guide you out of old despond . <p> Frank says , " This is our inning . " <p> And Toots says , " Better be . Because these shitheel Dodgers are making me nervous . " <p> Jackie is passing beers along the row . <p> Frank says , " Seems to me we 've all made our true loyalties known . Shown our hearts ' desire . We got a couple of old-timey Giant fans . And this porpoise with a haircut from Brooklyn . But what about our friend the G-man . Is it G for Giants ? Fess up , Edgar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeps across the Director 's face . <p> " I do n't have a rooting interest . Whoever wins , " he says softly . " That 's my team . " <p> He is thinking of something else entirely . The way our allies one by one will receive the news of the Soviet bomb . The thought is grimly cheering . Over the years he has found it necessary to form joint ventures with the intelligence heads of a number of countries and he wants them all to die a little . <p> Look at the four of them . Each with a hanky neatly tucked in his breast pocket . Each holding his beer away from his body , leaning forward to tease the high scud from the rim of the cup . Gleason with a flower in his lapel , a damp aster snatched from a vase at Toots 's place . People are still after him to do lines from the show . <p> They want him to say , " Hearty har-har . " <p> The plate umpire stands mask in hand , nearly blimpish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting the pitcher 's warmup tosses . This is the small dogged conscience of the game . Even in repose he shows a history thick with embranglement , duststomping men turning figures in the steep sun . You can see it in his face , chin thrust , a glower working under his brow . When the number reaches eight he aims a spurt from his chaw and prepares to take his whisk-broom to the rubber slab . <p> In the stands Bill Waterson takes off his jacket and dangles it lengthwise by the collar . It is rippled and mauled and seems to strike him as a living body he might want to lecture sternly . After a pause he folds it over twice and drops it on his seat . Cotter is sitting again , surrounded by mostly vertical people . Bill looms above him , a sizable guy , a onetime athlete by the look of him , getting thick in the middle , his shirt wet under the arms . Lucky seventh . Cotter needs a measly run to keep him from despairing  --  the cheapest eked-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up . You know that thing that happens when you give up before the end and then your team comes back to perform acts of valor and you feel a queasy shame stealing over you like pond slick . He looks at Bill 's hands , studying the pale hair just above the finger joints . <p> Bill says down to him , " I take my seventh-inning stretch seriously . I not only stand . I damn well make it a point to stretch . " <p> " I 've been noticing , " says Cotter . <p> " Because it 's a custom that 's been handed down . It 's part of something . It 's our own little traditional thing . You stand , you stretch  --  it 's a privilege in a way . " <p> Bill has some fun doing various stylized stretches , the bodybuilder , the pet cat , and he tries to get Cotter to do a drowsy kid in a classroom . <p> " That 's the thing about baseball . You do what they did before you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole long line . A man takes his kid to a game and thirty years later this is what they talk about when the poor old mutt 's wasting away in the hospital . Maybe it 's the only thing they 're able to talk about that does n't have some anger in it . Or maybe it 's just the closest memory they share . Did you ever tell me your name ? " <p> " Cotter . " <p> " Or a game of catch in the park . You wo n't get sentimental about your old man until you 're my age . Then it hits you full tilt . Not that we did n't have our share of knock-down-drag-out fights , about one a week that you could set your watch by . " <p> " Who got dragged out ? " <p> " The same as got knocked down . You 're looking at him . " <p> Bill scoops his jacket off the seat and puts it on his lap when he sits down . Seconds later he is standing again , he and Cotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes up , bushy and dense , and the fans send more paper sailing to the base of the wall . Old shopping lists and ticket stubs and wads of listed newsprint come falling around Pafko in the faded afternoon . Farther out in left field they are dropping paper on the Dodger bullpen , on the working figure of Labine and the working figure of Branca and the two men who are catching them and the men sitting under the canted roof that juts from the wall , the gum-chewing men with nothing to say . Branca wears the number thirteen blazoned on his back . <p> " Told you , " Bill says . " What did I tell you ? I told you . " <p> " Told me what ? " <p> " Big Newk 's losing it . " <p> " He has n't lost anything yet . " <p> " Everything 's in jeopardy . His shutout , his game , his season . Look at Robinson yapping at him . " And here Bill grips Cotter by the arm . " Telling him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , stay with it . ' " <p> " We still have to score the run , " Cotter says . <p> They take their seats and watch the hitter steer a look right up the line at Durocher dummying through the signs from the coach 's box at third . <p> Bill says , " I know what this calls for . A gentlemen 's wager . You 're such a gloomy Gus we need to take action . Now here 's the bet , old man . I say the Giants score this inning . If I 'm right , you lose the bet but you get a precious run or two for our team . If I 'm wrong , you 're still pulling a long face but at least you win the bet . " <p> Cotter says , " What 's the bet ? " <p> " Let 's say I buy you a hot dog with a mountain of sauerkraut . " <p> Bill rolls up his sleeves and shouts through his cupped hands at the players , some common encouragement  --  he stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's saying . <p> Cotter likes this man 's singleness of purpose , his insistence on faith and trust . It 's the only force available against the power of doubt . He figures he 's in the middle of getting himself befriended . It 's a feeling that comes from Bill 's easy voice and his sociable sweaty gymnasium bulk and the way he listens when Cotter speaks and the way he can make Cotter believe this is a long and close association they share  --  boon companions , goes the saying . He feels a little strange , it 's an unfamiliar thing , talking to Bill , but there 's a sense of something protective and enclosing that will help him absorb the loss if it should come to that . <p> He smells the peanuts on his fingers . It is a great rich fatty smell and he inhales sharply and looks at his fingers and realizes he has never fully noticed them . Everything else recedes around him , the game and noise and crowd , while he studies his fingers . It is surprising how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can write a book about a finger . He looks at the system of ridges on his fingertips , these are criminal prints , and it makes him wonder how many others made it over the turnstiles and what will happen to those who got caught and he imagines he is wanted by the FBI and thinks of himself leading a life of crime , alone in moonless streets , a rented room with neon vivid at the window . <p> Bill says , " Who 's better than us ? I mean we 're here , are n't we ? What else do we want ? We have to love it , do n't we ? " <p> Lockman squares around to bunt . There 's a man in the upper deck leafing through a copy of the current issue of Life . There 's a man on Twelfth Street in Brooklyn who has attached a tape machine to his radio so he can record the voice of Russ Hodges broadcasting the game . The man does n't know why he 's doing this . It is just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game twice , it is like being young and being old , and this will turn out to be the only known recording of Russ 's famous account of the final moments of the game . The game and its extensions . The woman cooking cabbage . The man who wishes he could be done with drink . They are the game 's remoter soul . Connected by the pulsing voice on the radio , joined to the word-of-mouth that passes the score along the street and to the fans who call the special phone number and the crowd at the ballpark that becomes the picture on television , people the size of Minute rice , and the game as rumor and conjecture and inner history . There 's a sixteen-year-old in the Bronx who takes his radio up to the roof of his building so he can listen alone , a Dodger fan slouched in the gloom , and he hears the account of the misplayed bunt and the fly bail that scores the tying run and he looks out over the rooftops , the tar beaches with their clotheslines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with total fear . The game does n't change the way you sleep or wash your face or chew your food . It changes nothing but your life . <p> The producer says , " At last , at least , a run . " <p> Russ is frazzled , brother , he is raw and rumpled and uncombed . When the teams go to the top of the eighth he reports that they have played one hundred and fifty-four regular-season games and two playoff games and seven full innings of the third playoff game and here they are tied in a knot , absolutely deadlocked , they are stalemated , folks , so light up a Chesterfield and stay right here . <p> The next half-inning seems to take a week . Russ sees the Dodgers put men on first and third . He watches Maglie bounce a curve in the dirt . He sees Leo come out to order an intentional walk . The crowd noise is wavering and drained . He sees Thomson try to backhand a tricky bouncer on the off-hop . A hollow clamor begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time to make out individual voices , men calling from the deep reaches , an animal awe and desolation . He sees Cox bang a shot past third that nearly takes Thomson with it into left field . Russ is feeling dashed , that 's the only damn word , and it 's an effort for him to speak into the mike . People are moving steadily toward the field boxes below the broadcast booth . They are moving out of the rear sections to get close to the field . He sees a priest with a passel of boys in white shirts and blue ties . He hears the announcer on the other side of the blanket , it is Harry Caray and he is sounding like his usual chipper self and Russ thinks of the Japanese word for ritual disembowelment and figures he and Harry ought to switch names right about now . He sees the fans move along the aisles and he feels the power of their discouragement . It is tastable in the air , the sense of promise come to waste . Paper goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose its coherence , people leaving the ballpark , people sitting on the concrete steps . Light is washing from the sky . He sees a man dancing down the aisle , a goateed black in a Bing Crosby shirt . Everything is changing shape , becoming something else . <p> Young Cotter can barely get out the words . <p> " What good does it do to tie the score if you 're going to turn around and let them walk all over you ? " <p> Bill says , " They 're going into that dugout and I guarantee you they 're not giving up . They 're not sitting there hitching and moaning . There 's no quit in this team . We 've got two turns at bat . We 're buddies in bad times  --  got ta stick together . " <p> Cotter feels a mood coming on , a complicated self-pity , the strength going out of his arms and a voice commencing in his head that reproaches him for caring . And the awful part is that he wallows in it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of losing , being a loser , drawing it out , expanding it , making it sickly sweet , being someone carefully chosen for the role . <p> Bill says , " I 'm still a believer . What about you ? " <p> At least he is miserable in the house of misery . He is not listening to the radio in the kitchen where nobody understands what this means . He is here in misery 's own keep . Ahead is the long walk home and that will be worse than anything , voices coming out of his pockets to razz him . <p> The score is 4-1 . <p> It should have rained in the third or fourth inning . Great rain drenching down . It should have thundered and lightning 'd . The thing he 'd feared did not happen and now he wishes it had and he wonders if this is an element that has to be figured in every time he rates a situation . Players fleeing their positions in the smashing rain . Heads bent , game called . <p> Bill jabs him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talks a few lines of a song that says ac-cen-tuate the positive e-lim-inate the negative and he clips the syllables and does the stresses and Cotter has to grin at the jokiness of it but also finds himself flattered and coaxed and foolishly boosted . <p> The pitcher takes off his cap and rubs his forearm across his hairline . Then he blows in the cap . Then he shakes the cap and puts it back on . <p> Shor looks at Gleason . <p> " Still making with the mouth . Leave the people alone already . They came here to see a game . " <p> " What game ? It 's a lambasting . We ought to go home . " <p> " We 're not going home , " Toots says . <p> " Ask your buddy Bones . Do we want to go home ? It 's a runaway with all the trimmings . " <p> Toots says , " We 're staying . " <p> Jackie says , " Ask your friend over here . Hey Bones . What do you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toots says , " We 're staying until the end . " <p> " I do n't know , " Frank says . " We could beat the crowd . " <p> Jackie says , " We could beat the crowd , clamhead . " <p> " We 're seeing the last out and then we 're beating the crowd . Not before . " <p> " I 'm for taking a vote , " says Frank . <p> Toots says , " You 're tubercular in the face . Eat something and sit back and watch the game . Because nobody goes until I go and I ai n't going . " <p> Jackie waves down a vendor and orders beers all around . Nothing happens in the home half of the eighth . People are moving toward the exit ramps . It is Erskine and Branca in the bullpen now with the odd paper shaving dropped from the upper deck . The Dodgers go down in the top of the ninth and this is when you notice the grass is patchy between the mound and the plate and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless scattering  --  nothing you 've put into this is recoverable and you do n't know whether you want to leave at once or stay forever , living under a blanket in the wind . <p> The engineer says , " Nice season , boys . Let 's do it again sometime . " <p> " I need a long holiday , " the producer says . <p> The engineer 's name is Turco . He says , " But what do you actually do that you need a holiday ? " <p> This is an old set piece and nobody listens . <p> " But what are we talking about here ? But what does the man do that he needs to drive his car to some lake in Jersey ? " <p> Russ lights another cigarette and for the first time all day he does not reproach himself for it . They owe him this one . He stands for a moment , mainly to separate his skin from his clothing . When his trousers lift away and go loose at the knees and crotch he feels a disproportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . He observes that the floor of the booth is covered with butts and wrappers and other debris . And he hears the unventilated beat of Turco 's voice . And he hears the solitary wailing from high in the stands , the lone-wolf call of some fan who bears the circumstances gravely . And he hears his statistician reciting numbers in French . It is all part of the same thing , the sense of some collapsible fact that 's folded up and put away , and the school gloom that traces back for decades  --  the last laden day of summer vacation when the range of play tapers to a screwturn . They were intent on socializing little Russell , fitting him to the shared institutions and the common culture . This is the day he has never shaken off , the final Sunday before the first Monday of school . It carried some queer deep shadow out to the western edge of the afternoon . <p> " But what does he do all day that he has to take long walks in the woods with some dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all this crammed maleness is making Russ edgy . He wants to go home and watch his daughter ride her bike down a leafy street . <p> Dark reaches for a pitch and hits a seeing-eye bouncer that ticks off the end of the first baseman 's glove . <p> A head pops up over the blanket , it 's the engineer from KMOX , and he starts telling a joke about the fastest lover in Mexico  --  een May-heeko . An amazing chap named Speedy Gonzalez . <p> Russ is thinking base hit all the way but glances routinely at the clubhouse sign in straightaway center to see if the first E in CHESTERFIELD lights up , indicating error . <p> Robinson retrieves the ball in short right . <p> " So this guy 's on his honeymoon in Acapulco and he 's heard all the stories about the incredible cunning of Speedy Gonzalez and he 's frankly worried , he 's a highly nervous type , and so on the first night , the night of nights , he 's in bed with his wife and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speedy Gonzalez from sneaking in there when he 's not looking . " <p> Mueller stands in , taking the first pitch low . <p> In the Dodger dugout the manager picks up the phone and calls the bullpen for the skaty-eighth time to find out who 's throwing good and who ai n't . <p> Mueller sees a fastball belt-high and pokes a single to right . <p> " So then he 's dying for a smoke and he reaches over for a second to get his cigarettes and matches . " <p> Russ describes Dark going into third standing up . He sees Thomson standing in the dugout with his arms raised and his hands held backwards gripping the edge of the roof . He describes people standing in the aisles and others moving down toward the field . <p> Irvin dropping the weighted bat . <p> " So then he lights up quick and reaches back to the bed finger-first . " <p> Maglie 's already in the clubhouse sitting in his skivvies in that postgame state of disrepair and pit stink that might pass for some shambles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Irvin stands in . <p> Russ describes Newcombe taking a deep breath and stretching his arms over his head . He describes Newcombe looking in for the sign . <p> " And Speedy Gonzalez says , ' Sen-yor-or , you got your finger up my a-ass . ' " <p> Russ hears most of this and wishes he had n't . He does a small joke of his own , half-standing to drape the microphone with his suit coat as if to keep the smallest oddment of raw talk from reaching his audience . Those are decent people out there . He knows it is foolish to think of his audience sentimentally , one of those fond groupings of mom , dad , sis , and junior settled contentedly around the big console with the glowing dial and grandma with her knitting and the spaniel flop-eared on the rug . He knows we do n't look like that anymore . The postwar boom has changed the way we look . We 're beginning to look younger , sleeker , we 're beginning to think of dinette sets , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The crowd noise is uncertain . They do n't know if this is a rally in the works or just another drag-tail finish that shortens everybody 's life . It 's a high rackety noise that makes Russ think of restive waiting , of train stations and bus terminals , the harsh echoes of some vague commotion . <p> Irvin tries to pull it , overeager , first-pitch hitting , and he lifts the ball to the right side and Russ hears the soul of the crowd repeat the sorry arc of the baseball , a moaned vowel falling softly to earth . Foul pop , easy out . <p> Yes . There 's something restless and scattered about us now . But Russ wants to believe there are people still assembled in some recognizable fashion , the kindred unit at the radio , old lines and ties and propinquities . These thoughts fade and return . They are not distractions . He is alert to every movement on the field . His mother used to make him gargle with warm water and salt when he complained of a sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family gathered around the gramophone and listened to Caruso and Galli-Curci , names from the photographed Europe , the place of boulevards and long shadows . The records were blank on one side and so brittle they would crack if you looked at them crosseyed . That was the going joke . <p> Lockman stands in . <p> And the contralto Schumann-Heink . Rare names but warm and strong , bright in their own way as the redneck monikers of ballplayers he followed in the papers every day , Eppa Rixey and Hod Eller and old Ivy Wingo . <p> A couple of swabbies move down to the rail near third base . <p> Dressen goes out to the mound in a waddling trot to talk to his pitcher . Russ is hunched over the mike . The field seems to open outward into nouns and verbs . All he has to do is talk . <p> Saying , " And now action is ready to resume . Dressen is leaving Newcombe in and he 's got Carl Erskine and fireballer Ralph Branca still throwing in the bullpen . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case . " <p> Lockman stands in again . <p> Pitch . <p> He fouls it back into the netting . <p> Now the rhythmic applause starts , tentative at first , then spreading densely through the stands . This is how the crowd enters the game . The repeated three-beat has the force of some abject faith , a desperate kind of will toward magic and accident . <p> He stands in once more , wagging the yellow bat . <p> They are a mass of rooters now , hand-banging and foot-pounding . This is the sound that Russ has been waiting for all inning . He was beginning to think they 'd simply forgotten . <p> He hits the second pitch on a low line over third . Russ hears Harry Caray shouting into the mike on the other side of the blanket . Then they are both shouting and the ball is slicing toward the line and landing fair and sending up a spew of dirt and forcing Pafko into the corner once again . <p> Men running , the sprint from first to third , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action on the base paths . All the Giants up at the front of the dugout . The crowd is up , heads weaving for better views . Men running through a slide of noise that comes heaving down on them . <p> The pitch was off the plate and he reached for it and Harry started shouting . <p> The hit obliterates the beat of the crowd 's rhythmic clapping . They 're coming into open roar . They 're absorbing the moment , placing the base runners , they 're checking the score and the outs and the hitter up next and they 're making a noise that keeps enlarging itself in breadth and range . This is the crowd made over , the crowd renewed . <p> Harry started shouting and then Pafko went into the corner and the paper began to fall . <p> One out , one in , two runs down , men on second and third . Russ thinks every word may be his last . He feels the redness in his throat , the pinpoint constriction . Dressen out to the mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured sliding or not sliding , stopping short and catching his spikes on the bag , in pain , the crowd slowly coming to notice and people saying did you see it , did you see it , did you see it , and what happened did you see it  --  should have slid but did n't . <p> They keep moving toward the field . They 're coming from the far ends of the great rayed configuration and they 're moving down the aisles and toward the rails . <p> The paper started falling , crushed traffic tickets and field-stripped cigarettes and work from the office and scorecards in the shape of airplanes , windblown and mostly white , and Pafko taut near the wall watching the infield . When he walks back to his position he alters stride to kick a soda cup lightly and the gesture functions as a form of recognition , a hint of some concordant force between players and fans , and maybe something deeper , the way he nudges the white cup , it 's a little onside boot , completely unbegrudging  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the patterns that are undivinable , and those who notice find the moment touched by grace and fate . <p> The trainer comes out and they put Mueller on a stretcher and take him toward the clubhouse . Mueller 's pain , the flare of pulled tendons , the pain that makes you twist your head away from the place that hurts  --  a man on a stretcher makes sense here . Mueller carries the crowd 's belief that sensation is the source of knowledge , that pain can bring us to a durable truth . Whatever they believe as individuals , this is the crowd 's conviction . They will forget him the instant he is off the field . They would forget him if he were dead . But while he is in sight , in pain , escorted by a train of men , Doc Bowman and his bearers , he gives the crowd a satisfying sense of the pain the game exacts , the kind of pain that makes you think , if it is yours , that there is nothing in the material tier more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the crowd to rebuild its noise . Russ keeps pausing at the mike to let the sound collect . This is a rumble of a magnitude he has never heard before . You ca n't call it cheering or rooting . It 's a territorial roar , the claim of the ego that separates it from other selves , from everything outside the walls . <p> Russ nuzzles up to the mike and tries to be calm although he is very close to speaking in a shout because this is the only way to be heard . <p> Men clustered on the mound and the manager waving to the bullpen and the pitcher walking in and the pitcher leaving and the runner for Mueller doing knee bends at third . <p> They are banging on the roof of the booth . <p> Russ says , " So do n't go way . Light up that Chesterfield . We 're gon na stay right here and see how big Ralph Branca will fare . " <p> Yes . It is Branca coming through the dampish glow . Branca who is tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dale , he has the aura of a man encumbered . The drooping lids , clodhopper feet , the thick ridge across the brow . His face is set behind a somber nose , broad-bridged and looming . <p> The stadium police are taking up posts . In the upper deck the man with a copy of Life is tearing out the pages and dropping them uncrumpled over the rail , letting them fall in a seesaw drift on the bawling fans below . He is moved to do this by the paper falling elsewhere , the contagion of paper  --  it is giddy and unformulated fun . He begins to ignore the game so he can watch the paper fall . The act is mechanical and dumb , you tear out a page and waft it , but the fellow likes to believe it brings him into contact with the other paper-throwers and with the fans in the lower deck who reach for his pages and catch them  --  they are all a second force that 's deeper than the game . <p> Not far away another man feels something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to sit down but does n't know if he can reach his arm back to lower himself to the seat . <p> Branca who is twenty-five but makes you think he exemplifies ancient toil . By the time he reaches the mound the stretcher-bearers have managed to get Mueller up the steps and into the club-house . The crowd is relieved that he is gone . The noise expands once more . Branca takes the ball and the men around the mound recede to the fringes . <p> Shor looks at Gleason . <p> He says , " Tell me you want to go home . What happened to Let 's go home ? If we leave now , we can beat the crowd . " <p> He says , " I ca n't visualize it enough , both you crumbums , you deserve every misery in the book . " <p> Jackie looks miserable all right . He loosens his necktie and undoes the top button of his shirt . He 's the only member of the quartet not on his feet but it is n't the shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Tell me you want to go home so I can run ahead and hold the car door open and like usher you inside . " <p> Paper is coming down around the group , big slick pages from a magazine , completely unremarkable in the uproar of the moment . Frank snatches a full-page ad for something called pasteurized process cheese food , a Borden 's product , that 's the company with the cow , and there 's a four-color picture of yellowish pressed pulp melting horribly on a hot dog . <p> Frank deadpans the page to Gleason . <p> " Here . This will help you digest . " <p> Jackie sits there like an air traveler in a down-draft . The pages keep falling . Baby food , instant coffee , encyclopedias and cars , waffle irons and shampoos and blended whiskeys . Piping times , an optimistic bounty that carries into the news pages where the nation 's farmers record a bumper crop . And the resplendent products , how the dazzle of a Packard car is repeated in the feature story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the same thing . Rubens and Titian and Playtex and Motorola . And here 's a picture of Sinatra himself sitting in a nightclub in Nevada with Ava Gardner and would you check that cleavage . Frank did n't know he was in this week 's Life until the page fell out of the sky . He has people who are supposed to tell him these things . He keeps the page and reaches for another to stuff in Gleason 's face . Here 's a Budweiser ad , pal . In a country that 's in a hurry to make the future , the names attached to the products are an enduring reassurance . Johnson &; Johnson and Quaker State and RCA Victor and Burlington Mills and Bristol-Myers and General Motors . These are the venerated emblems of the burgeoning economy , easier to identify than the names of battlefields or dead presidents . Not that Jackie 's in the mood to scan a magazine . He is sunk in deep inertia , a rancid sweat developing , his mouth filled with the foretaste of massive inner shiftings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flicking the glove to indicate a curve . Never mind the details of manner or appearance , the weight-bearing body at rest . Out on the mound he is strong and loose , cutting smoothly out of his windup , a man who wants the ball . <p> Furillo watching from right field . The stone-cut profile . <p> There 's a guy in the bleachers pacing the aisles , a neighborhood crazy , he waves his arms and mumbles , short , chunky , bushy-haired  --  could have been one of the Ritz Brothers or the Marx Brothers before they cast him out , or a lost member of the Three Stooges , the fourth stooge , he 's called Flippo or Beppo or Dummy or Shaky , and he 's distracting the people nearby , they 're yelling at him to sidown , goway , meshuggener , and he paces and worries , he shakes his head and moans . It is the head-shaking that gets them mad . He thinks he knows something they do n't . He 's right , they 're wrong . Up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head going so fast it 's making people dizzy . <p> Russ feels the weight of the men in the booth , the concentrated bulk that shapes their alertness , the thickness of mood , the detailed regard , the heedful pauses in their breathing . <p> Frank keeps putting pages in Gleason 's face . <p> He tells him , " Eat up , pal . Paper clears the palate . " <p> When in steps Thomson . <p> The tall fleet Scot . Talking to himself as he gets set in the box . See the ball . Wait for the ball . Do your job , fool . <p> Russ clutching the mike . Warm water and salt . <p> Thomson 's not sure he sees things clearly . His eyeballs are humming . There 's a feeling in his body , he 's digging in , settling into his stance , crowd noise packing the sky , and there 's a feeling that he has lost the link to his surroundings . Alone in all this rowdy-dow . See the ball . Quick hands . Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby . It 's like the first waking moment of the day and you do n't know whose house you 're in . <p> Russ says , " Bobby Thomson up there swinging . " <p> Mays down on one knee in the on-deck circle half-leaning on his cradled bat and watching Branca go into a full windup , push-pull click-click , thinking it 's all on him if Thomson fails , the season riding on him , it 's all on me , here I am , the jingle playing in his head . <p> There 's an emergency station under the stands and what the stadium cop has to do is figure out a way to get the stricken man down there in a wheelchair without being overrun by a rampant stomping madman crowd . The victim looks okay , considering . He is sitting down , waiting for the attendants to arrive with the wheelchair . It may be a while . The staff is not known for swiftness of performance even on the dullest days . All right , maybe he does n't look so good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he can make a fist and stick out his tongue and there 's not much the cop can do until the wheelchair arrives , so he might as well stand in the aisle and watch the end of the game . <p> Thomson in his bent stance , chin tucked , waiting . <p> Russ says , " One out , last of the ninth . " <p> He says , " Branca pitches , Thomson takes a strike called on the inside corner . " <p> He lays a heavy decibel on the word " strike . " He pauses to let the crowd reaction build . Do not talk against the crowd . Let the drama come from them . <p> Those big rich pages airing down from the upper deck . <p> Lockman stands near second and tries to wish a hit onto Thomson 's bat . That may have been the pitch he wanted . Belt-high , a shade inside  --  wo n't see one that good again . <p> Russ says , " Bobby hitting at .292 . He 's had a single and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run with a long fly to center . " <p> Lockman looks across the diamond at home . The double he hit is still a presence in his chest , it 's chugging away in there , a body-memory that plays the moment over . He is peering into the deltoid opening between the catcher 's knees . He sees the fingers dip , the blunt hand make a flapping action up and left . They 'll give him the fastball high and tight and come back with the curve away . A pretty two-part scheme . Seems easy and sweet from here . <p> Russ says , " Brooklyn leads it four to two . " He says , " Runner down the line at third . Not taking any chances . " <p> Thomson thinking it 's all happening too fast . Thinking quick hands , see the ball , give yourself a chance . Bristol in the Appalachian League . Rocky Mount in the Bi-State League . Jersey City in the International League . <p> Russ says , " Lockman without too big of a lead at second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits one . " <p> In the box seats Edgar plucks a magazine page off his shoulder , where the thing had lighted and stuck . At first he 's annoyed that the object has come in contact with his body . Then his eyes fall upon the page . It is a color reproduction of a painting crowded with medieval figures who are dying or dead  --  a landscape of visionary havoc and ruin . Edgar has never seen a painting quite like this . It covers the page completely and must surely dominate the magazine . Across the red-brown earth skeleton armies on the march . Men impaled on lances , hung from gibbets , drawn on spoked wheels fixed to the tops of bare trees , bodies open to the crows . Legions of the dead forming up behind shields made of coffin lids . Death astride a slat-ribbed hack , he is peaked for blood , his scythe held ready as he presses people in haunted swarms toward the entrance of some hell trap , an oddly modern construction that could be a subway tunnel or office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is clear to Edgar that the page is from Life and he tries to work up an anger , he asks himself why a magazine called Life would want to reproduce a painting of such lurid and dreadful dimensions . But he ca n't take his eyes off the page . <p> Russ Hodges says , " Branca throws . " <p> Gleason makes a noise that is halfway between a sigh and a moan . It is probably a sough , as of rustling surf in some palmy place . Edgar recalls the earlier blowout , Jackie 's minor choking fit . He sees a deeper engagement here . He goes out into the aisle and up two steps , separating himself from the imminent discharge of animal , vegetable , and mineral matter . <p> Not a good pitch to hit , up and in , but Thomson swings and tomahawks the ball and everybody , everybody watches . Except for Gleason who is bent over in his seat , hands locked behind his neck , a creamy strand of slime swinging from his lips . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> His voice has a burst in it , a charge of expectation . <p> He says , " It 's gon na be . " <p> There 's a pause all around him . Pafko racing toward the left-field corner . <p> He says , " I believe . " <p> Pafko at the wall . Then he 's looking up . People thinking where 's the ball . The scant delay , the stay in time that lasts a hairsbreadth . And Cotter standing in Section 35 watching the ball come in his direction . He feels his body turn to smoke . He loses sight of the ball when it climbs above the overhang and he thinks it will land in the upper deck . But before he can smile or shout or bash his neighbor on the arm . Before the moment can overwhelm him , the ball appears again , stitches visibly spinning , that 's how near it hits , banging at an angle off a pillar  --  hands flashing everywhere . <p> Russ feels the crowd around him , a shudder passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mike and there is a surge of color and motion , a crash that occurs upward , stadiumwide , hands and faces and shirts , bands of rippling men , and he is outright shouting , his voice has a power he 'd thought long gone  --  it may lift the top of his head like a cartoon rocket . <p> He says , " The Giants win the pennant . " <p> A topspin line drive . He tomahawked the pitch and the ball had topspin and dipped into the lower deck and there is Pafko at the 315 sign looking straight up with his right arm braced at the wall and a spate of paper coming down . <p> He says , " The Giants win the pennant . " <p> Yes , the voice is excessive with a little tickle of hysteria in the upper register . But it is mainly wham and whomp . He sees Thomson capering around first . The hat of the first base coach  --  the first base coach has flung his hat straight up . He went for a chin-high pitch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sank , missing the facade of the upper deck and dipping into the seats below  --  pulled in , swallowed up  --  and the Dodger players stood looking , already separated from the event , staring flat into the shadows between the decks . <p> He says , " The Giants win the pennant . " <p> " The crew is whooping . They are answering the roof-bangers by beating on the walls and ceiling of the booth . People climbing the dugout roofs and the crowd shaking in its own noise . Branca on the mound in his tormented slouch . He came with a fastball up , a pitch that 's tailing in , and the guy 's supposed to take it for a ball . Russ is shouting himself right out of his sore throat , out of every malady and pathology and complaint and all the atavistic pangs of growing up and every memory that is not tender . <p> He says , " The Giants win the pennant . " <p> Four times . Branca turns and picks up the rosin bag and throws it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned at a slant  --  he begins the long dead trudge . Paper falling everywhere . Russ knows he ought to settle down and let the mike pick up the sound of the swelling bedlam around him . But he ca n't stop shouting , there 's nothing left of him but shout . <p> He says , " Bobby Thomson hits into the lower deck of the left-field stands . " <p> He says , " The Giants win the pennant and they 're going crazy . " <p> He says , " They 're going crazy . " <p> Then he raises a pure shout , wordless , a holler from the old days  --  it is fiddlin ' time , it is mountain music on WCKY at five-thirty in the morning . The thing comes jumping right out of him , a jubilation , it might be heyyy-ho or it might be oh-boyyy shouted backwards or it might be something else entirely  --  hard to tell when they do n't use words . And Thomson 's teammates gathering at home plate and Thomson circling the bases in gamesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a romping boy lost to time , and his breath comes so fast he does n't know if he can handle all the air that 's pouring in . He sees men in a helter-skelter line waiting at the plate to pummel him  --  his teammates , no better fellows in the world , and there 's a look in their faces , they are stunned by a happiness that has collapsed on them , bright-eyed under their caps . <p> He tomahawked the pitch , he hit on top of it , and now his ears are ringing and there 's a numbing buzz in his hands and feet . And Robinson stands behind second , hands on hips , making sure that Thomson touches every base . You can almost see brave Jack growing old . <p> Russ pauses for the first time and catches the full impact of the noise around him . It sounds like static , it sounds like radio static , like massive static from afar that 's jamming the band  --  a dense cosmic shimmer in the air , the sound of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning . The manager stands and spins , he is spinning with his arms spread wide  --  maybe it 's an ascetic rapture , some kind of Sufi exercise , they do it in a mosque in eastern Turkey . He is standing near third base spinning and here is Stanky in a team jacket coming out of the dugout and running across the diamond right at Leo . Stanky bangs into him and tries to bring him down and Thomson rounds third knowing there 's something happening here that makes no sense and they both go after him and Stanky wo n't let go of Leo and bulldogs him to the ground halfway to home . <p> People make it a point to register the time . <p> Edgar stands with arms crossed and a level eye on Gleason folded over . Pages dropping all around them , it is a fairly thick issue  --  laxatives and antacids , sanitary napkins and corn plasters and dandruff removers . Jackie utters an aquatic bark , it is loud and crude , the hoarse call of some mammal in distress . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomiting someone 's taupe pajamas . The waste is liquidy smooth in the lingo of adland and it is splashing freely on Frank 's stout oxford shoes and fine lisle hose and on the soft woven wool of his town-and-country trousers . <p> The clock atop the clubhouse reads 3:58 . <p> Russ has got his face back into the mike . He shouts , " I do n't believe it . " He shouts , " I do n't believe it . " He shouts , " I do not believe it . " <p> They are coming down to crowd the railings . They are gathered at the netting behind home , gripping the tight mesh . <p> Pafko is out of paper range by now , jogging toward the clubhouse . But the paper keeps falling . It is coming down from all points , laundry tickets , envelopes stolen from the office , rolls of toilet tissue unbolting lyrically in streamers , pages from memo pads and pocket calendars , old letters that people carry around for years pressed in their wallets , the residue of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are throwing faded dollar bills , snapshots torn to pieces , ruffled paper swaddles for cupcakes , there are crushed cigarette packs and sticky wrap from ice cream sandwiches and bond paper in a soft-white eggshell finish  --  very sort of thin sheet material made of cellulose pulp and derived mainly from wood and rags and grasses and processed into flexible leaves and used chiefly for writing , printing , drawing , package-wrapping , and covering your kitchen walls . <p> Russ is still shouting , he is not yet shouted out , he believes he has a thing that 's worth repeating . <p> Saying , " Bobby Thomson hit a line drive into the lower deck of the left-field stands and the place is going crazy . " <p> Next thing Cotter knows he is sidling into the aisle . The area is congested and intense and he has to pry his way row by row using elbows and shoulders . Nobody much seems to notice . The ball is back there in a mighty pileup of shirts and jackets . The game is way behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baseball now and there 's no time to ask himself why . They hit it in the stands , you go and get it . It 's the ball they play with , the thing they rub up and scuff and sweat on . He 's going up the aisle through a thousand pounding hearts . He 's prodding and sideswiping . He sees people dipping frantically , it could be apple-bobbing in Indiana , only slightly violent . Then the ball comes free and someone goes after it , he 's the first one out of the pack and he goes after it , a young guy with tight hair , and he goes in a scuttling crawl with people reaching for him , trying to grab his jacket , a fistful of trouser-ass . He has tight wavy hair and a college jacket  --  you know those athletic jackets where the sleeves are one color and leathery and the body is a darker color and probably wool and these are the college colors of the team . <p> Cotter takes a guess and edges his way along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes a guess , he anticipates , it 's the way you feel something will happen and then you watch it uncannily come to pass , occurring almost in measured stages so you can see the wheelwork of your idea fitting into place . <p> He coldcocked the pitch and the ball shot out there and dipped and disappeared . And Thomson bounding down on home plate mobbed by his teammates , who move in shuffled steps with hands extended to keep from spiking each other . And photographers edging near and taking their spread stances and the first of the fans appearing on the field , the first strays standing wary or whirling about to see things from this perspective , astonished to find themselves at field level , or running right at Thomson all floppy and demented , milling into the wedge of players at home plate . <p> Frank is looking down at what has transpired . He stands there hands out , palms up , an awe of muted disgust . That this should happen here , in public , in the high revel of event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looks down at the back of Jackie 's glossy head and he looks at his own trouser cuffs flaked an intimate beige and the spatter across his shoe tops in a strafing pattern and the gumbo puddle nearby that contains a few laggard gobs of pinkoid stuff from deep in Gleason 's gastric sac . <p> And he nods his head and says , " My shoes . " <p> And Shor feels offended , he feels a look come into his face that carries the sting of a bad shave , those long-ago mornings of razor pull and cold water . <p> And he looks at Frank and says , " Did you see the homer at least ? " <p> " I saw part and missed part . " <p> And Shor says , " Do I want to take the time to ask which part you missed so we can talk about it on the phone someday ? " <p> There are people with their hands in their hair , holding in their brains . <p> Frank persists in looking down . He allows one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his shoe for vomit marks . He sees a horizontal rash that drips thickly in several places toward the sole and heel . These are handcrafted shoes from a narrow street with a quaint name in oldest London . <p> And Shor says , " We just won unbelievable , they 're ripping up the joint , I do n't know whether to laugh ; shit , or go blind . " <p> And Frank says , " I 'm rooting for number one or number three . " <p> And Shor says , " Let me get to the point . This is an all-time memory . This is a thing I 'll never forget in my normal life span except you 're ruining my memory in advance by standing here with your hands flapped out saying , ' My shoes . ' " <p> Frank decides there is no need to inspect his socks . Because he feels the alien damp . Because the stink is rising up his legs and under his belt and into his shirt , this beer-blast funk from the gutter . His hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement at this mischance . <p> Russ is still manning the microphone and has one last thing to say and barely manages to get it out . <p> " The Giants won it . By a score of five to four . And they 're picking Bobby Thomson up . And carrying him off the field . " <p> If his voice has an edge of desperation it 's because he has to get to the clubhouse to do interviews with players and coaches and team officials and the only way to get out there is to cross the length of the field on foot and he 's already out of breath , out of words , and the crowd is growing over the walls . He sees four ushers trying to carry a man in a big coat toward the box seats , the fellow is swimming in their grip . He sees Thomson carried by a phalanx of men , players and others , mostly others  --  the players have run for it , the players are dashing for the clubhouse  --  and he sees Thomson riding off balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the ballpark and into the streets for a block party . He sees Thomson and loses him , he tries to find him down there , he sees him drop abruptly and try to run off , fend off the hands , there are people chock up against each other , moving in a vortex around Thomson . <p> Gleason is suspended in wreckage , bulbous and humped , and he has barely the wit to consider what the shouting 's about . <p> It is always a scare when fans mix with players . There is something fundamentally wrong . It shakes the observer , it makes Russ feel that some long-standing logic has collapsed . Those people do n't belong on the field . It 's something about uniforms , the uniformed men poked and jolted by people in a hundred kinds of unmatching clothes , any-color shoes or pants  --  divers , from the Bible . There 's something about the field streaked with people that makes Russ understand why he always feels clumsy when he walks across the diamond to the clubhouse  --  he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what you wear . <p> He sees Thomson darting between people , the hat-snatchers , the swift kids who imitate banking aircraft , their spread arms steeply raked . He takes half a dozen strides and has to slow down and veer away , he uses his forearm to repel when he feels threatened  --  they want to slap his back and wrestle him down , tell him something about their lives . <p> All over the city people are coming out of their houses . This is the nature of Thomson 's homer . It makes people want to be in the streets , joined with others , telling others what has happened , those few who have n't heard  --  comparing faces and states of mind . <p> And Russ has a hot mike in front of him and has to find someone to take it and talk so he can get down to the field and find a way to pass intact through all that mangle . <p> And Cotter is under a seat hand-fighting someone for the baseball . He emphatically wants the ball . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the open grass . It 's the season-ending smash and he is trying to get a firmer grip , he is compressing his body , he is wadding his body under the seat so he can isolate his rival , he can block his rival 's access to the baseball except for the one hand  --  the rival 's arm stretched under the seat from the row above and the hand that clutches the ball . <p> He is shrunken and bent , he is wrapped around a seat leg and straining to place his weight on the rival 's arm . He needs to adjust his head and get his armpit over the middle part of the rival 's arm and press his skinny frame on the whole arm and use both his hands to prise the ball from the rival 's isolated hand . <p> It is a tight little theater of hands and arms , some martial test with formal rules of grappling . <p> He is working to isolate the rival 's hand . He wants to get his body between the rival 's body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts into his back . He hears the earnest breathing of the rival . They are working for advantage , trying to gain position . There is the crowd noise around them , the great beating of voices , completely meaningless to Cotter  --  he only hears the regulated grunts , the rival 's earnest labor for the ball . <p> People made it a point to read the time on the clock atop the notched facade of the clubhouse , the high battlement  --  they registered the time when the ball went in . <p> And Cotter is tucked and wadded under the seat trying to separate the rival 's fingers from the ball . The competition of hands and arms is now a thing that 's down to fingers . He presses his weight on the rival 's arm and releases his own grip on the ball and takes the rival 's wrist with one hand and tries to unbend his fingers with the other . <p> The rival is blocked off by the seat back , he is facedown in the row above with just an arm stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and some fingers . It is down to fingers , it is concentrated effort that 's taking only seconds . <p> When Cotter sees this is n't working . When he knows he has to do something fast before somebody else gets into the thing , somebody takes sides  --  too much longer and they 'll take sides . <p> He is going fast , thinking fast  --  he gets his hands around the rival 's arm just above the wrist , it is completely concentrated work , he hears the labored grunts , it is an effort under a stadium seat with people looking on . <p> And if they take sides , there is the rival , the foe , the ofay , he sees the veins stretched and bulged across the white knuckles  --  guess who draws all the support . <p> Two heart attacks , not one . A second man collapses on the field , not exactly falling but letting himself down one knee at a time , slow and controlled , easing down on his right hand and tumbling dully over . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the type to do dog tricks in the dirt . Ushers drop the guy they were trying to carry off the field  --  he is loud and drunk and they bounce him on the earth , discard him and forget him  --  and then they lock arms at the wrists and make a sedan seat for the heart man and get him to the station under the grandstand . A doctor is there with a stethoscope down his shirt front and that master practitioner 's knack for blurring his gaze six inches before it reaches the stricken individual . <p> And Cotter 's hands around the rival 's arm , twisting in opposite directions , burning the skin  --  it 's called an Indian bum , remember ? One hand grinding one way , the other going the other , twisting hard , he knows there is n't time . <p> There 's a pause in the rival 's breathing . He is pausing to note the pain . He fairly croons his misgivings , it 's a sound in the manner of someone humming a trembly tune . Cotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opponent , the foe , twisting in opposite directions , and he feels the arm jerk and the fingers lift from the ball . <p> He holds his rival 's arm with one hand and goes for the ball with the other . He sees it begin to roll past the seat leg , wobbling on the textured cement . He sort of traps it with his eye and sends out a ladling hand . <p> The ball goes in a minutely crooked path into the open . <p> The action of his hand is as old as he is . It seems he has been sending out this hand for one thing or another since the minute he shot out of infancy . Everything he knows is contained in the spread-out fingers of this one bent hand . <p> The whole business under the seat has taken only seconds . Now he 's backing out , moving posthaste  --  he 's got the ball , he feels it hot and buzzy in his hand . <p> A sense of people grudgingly getting out of his way , making way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how people move out of someone 's way mainly to get a better look at him . In other words they 're not doing him any favors . They 're easing off and looking . They want to see who 's the grabby kid that moves so quick . <p> The ball is damp with the heat and sweat of the rival 's hand . He 's got his arm hanging lank at his side and he empties out his face , he is blank and disregardful and going down the rows by stepping over seat backs and fitting himself between bodies and walking on seats when it is convenient . <p> The idea is to move with inhuman speed and not draw notice . The idea is to be slack-bodied and casual and proceed at audacious rates . He keeps on descending from the scene . He steps into a row and works toward the aisle and the exit ramp nearby . The raised seams of the ball are pulsing in his hand . <p> One glance back at the area above , he allows himself a glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd , a casual , a neutral  --  and he sees the rival standing and looking . This is the man who has to be the rival , white-shirted and rumpled and hulking , up on his feet now , and it 's not the college boy he thought it might be , the white boy with nappy hair and a jacket with college colors . And the man catches his eye  --  this is not what Cotter wants , this is damage to the cause . He made a mistake looking back . He allowed himself a glance , a sidewise flash . Now he 's caught in the man 's field of vision , his contemplation of the crowd . <p> He realizes he did n't have to see the man to know who it is . There is a fact of knowing that applies retroactively . <p> Their eyes meet in the spaces between raised arms , between faces that jut and the broad backs of shouting fans . He is caught in the man 's hard glare and they look at each other over the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair all mussed , good neighbor Bill showing a wild-man smile . <p> The dead have come to take the living . The dead in winding-sheets , the regimented dead on horseback , the skeleton that plays a hurdy-gurdy . <p> Edgar stands in the aisle fitting together the two facing pages of the reproduction . People are climbing over seats , calling hoarsely toward the field . Edgar stands with the pages in his face . He had n't realized he was seeing only half the painting until the left-hand page drifted down and he got a glimpse of burnt sienna terrain and a pair of skeletal men pulling on bell ropes . The page brushed against a woman 's arm and spun into her vacated seat and Edgar slipped behind her in the tumult of the moment , sniffing at her neck to catch a nip of lilac . <p> Thomson is out past second base dodging fans who come in rushes and jumps . They jump against his body , they want to take him to the ground , show him snapshots of their families . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a sixteenth-century work done by a Flemish master , Pieter Bruegel , and it is called The Triumph of Death . <p> A nervy title me-thinks . But he is intrigued , he admits it  --  the left-hand page may be even better than the right . <p> He studies the tumbril filled with skulls . He stands in the aisle and looks at the naked man pursued by dogs . He looks at the gaunt dog nibbling the baby in the dead woman 's arms . These are not just dogs but long gaunt starveling hounds , they are war dogs , hell dogs , boneyard hounds beset by parasitic mites , by dog tumors and dog cancers . <p> Dear germ-free Edgar , the man who has an air-filtration system in his house to vaporize specks of dust  --  he finds a fascination in cankers , lesions , and rotting bodies so long as his connection to the source is strictly pictorial . <p> He finds a second dead woman in the middle ground , straddled by a skeleton . The positioning is sexual , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman being straddled or is it a man ? He stands in the aisle and they 're all around him cheering and he has the pages in his face . The painting has an instancy that he finds striking . Yes , the dead fall upon the living . But he begins to see that the living are sinners . The cardplayers , the lovers who dally , he sees the king in an ermine cloak with his fortune stashed in hogshead drums . The dead have come to empty out the wine gourds , to serve a skull on a platter to gentlefolk at their meal . He see gluttony , lust , and greed . <p> Edgar loves this stuff . Admit it  --  you love it . It causes a bristling of his body hair . Skeletons with wispy dicks . The dead beating kettledrums , the sackcloth dead slitting a pilgrim 's throat . <p> The meat-blood colors and massed bodies , this is a census-taking of awful ways to die . He looks at the flaring sky in the deep distance out beyond the headlands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , it suggests blast heat and firestorm , let 's face it , let 's own up to it , the panoramic death of airburst and radiation , let 's call it what they call it in the war room . <p> The old dead fucking the new . Is that a man or a woman being straddled ? The dead raising coffins from the earth . The hillside dead tolling the old rugged bells that clang for the sins of the world . <p> He looks up for a moment . He takes the pages from his face  --  it is a wrenching effort  --  and looks at the people on the field . Those who are happy and dazed . Those who run around the bases calling out the score . The ones who are so excited they wo n't sleep tonight . Those whose team has lost . The ones who taunt the losers . The fathers who ca n't wait to get home and tell their sons what they have seen . The husbands who want to jump on their wives . Those who press together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who will have fights on the subway going home . The ones already on the subway because they left before the game was over . The screamers and berserkers . The old friends who meet by accident out near second base . Those who will light the city with their bliss . <p> Cotter goes down the ramp telling himself there 's no reason to run . If you start running , then you 're saying there 's a reason and that 's when someone starts to chase . His long dusty fingers press the baseball to his leg . There 's a small solemn hop in his stride , a kind of endless levered up-and-down . You do n't want to run surrounded by crowd unless you 're sure there 's a body in pursuit . <p> He glances back every few paces to see where Mr. Bill is . The idea is to keep Bill in a position off his shoulder as opposed to directly behind him . This way you see him at a swivel , the distance unchanged , he 's maybe twenty yards back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ramp , then Cotter angles out . <p> People going in the forced motion of a downhill crowd , bodies tipped backwards to counteract the incline . <p> He sees the guy in the two-tone jacket fall in behind Bill . The college boy , determined . He 's got a face that comes to a corner in the front , sharp-edged as a hero in the comics . Cotter watches him draw up to Bill , he wants Bill to see him and approve his inclusion , his enlistment in the cause . <p> Cotter 's in no hurry , nobody 's hurrying here . They are three secret members of some organized event . Bill has lost his buckaroo grin . He barely shows an awareness that Cotter exists , a boy who walks the earth in basketball sneakers . Nobody wants to run or shout or make an unbecoming move . The crowd keeps them thoughtful and reserved . Let 's maintain a uniform pace and see how things develop . <p> Crowd voices on the ramp , echoes crashing and mixing . Cotter sees daylight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all that 's left of the last lighted hour . <p> He goes south on Eighth Avenue , keeping to the outer edge of the sidewalk so he ca n't be pinned against a fence or building . People jamming the street . There 's a stretched second of panic when he loses sight of Bill in the thousand bobbing heads , it 's an emptying of breath , a starkness  --  he feels a basic layer drop away , some material in the world swept from his perception . <p> Cotter 's body wants to go . But if he starts running at this point , what we have is a black kid running in a mainly white crowd and the kid 's being followed by a pair of irate whites yelling thief or grief or something . <p> Then he spots them both , they are closer to him than they ought to be , this is the second shock , and he sees that Bill has noticed his alarm  --  the big Bill smile is back , confident and amused . <p> Cotter smiles in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living day to day is knowing when to keep a distance and which murky doorways you 're advised to stay away from and how to read the face of some strongboy on the stroll . <p> With advancing dark the field is taking on a deeper light . The grass is incandescent , it has a heat and sheen . People go running past , looking half-ablaze , and Russ is moving with the tentative steps of some tourist at a grand bazaar , trying to handshuffle through the crowd . <p> Some ushers are lifting a drunk up off the firstbase line , it is the same man they were hauling off the field when Russ was in the booth , and he warps himself into a baggy mass and shakes free and begins to run around the bases in his double-breasted raincoat with long belt trailing . <p> Russ makes his way through the infield and dance-steps into an awkward jog that makes him feel ancient and disposable . But he tastes the air in his lungs and knows there is a silly grin pasted across his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is running across a ball field to conduct a dialogue with a pack of athletes in their underwear . <p> He says to someone running near him , " I do n't believe it , I still do n't believe it . " <p> Out in dead center he sees the clubhouse windows catch the trigger-glint of flashbulbs going off inside . He hears a shrill cheer and turns and sees the raincoat drunk sliding into third base . The sliders and leapers . The ones who drop down from the outfield walls . Those who still do n't believe it . Those who are basically wondering what 's for dinner when they get home . The cartwheelers . The ones who are describing the home run for those who somehow , tragically , missed it . <p> He realizes the man running nearby is Al Edelstein , his producer . <p> Al shouts , " Do you believe it ? " <p> " I do not believe it , " says Russ . <p> Then they shake hands on the run . <p> Al says , " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving a Cuban cigar . " It 's like I-don't-know-what . " <p> " If you do n't know what , then I do n't know what . " <p> " Save the voice , " says Al . <p> " The voice is dead and buried . It went to heaven on a sunbeam . " <p> " I 'll tell you one thing 's for certain , old pal . We 'll never forget today . " <p> " Glad you 're with me , buddy . " <p> The running men shake hands again . They are deep in the outfield now and Russ feels an ache in every joint . The clubhouse windows catch the flash of popping bulbs . <p> In the box seats across the field Edgar sets his hat at an angle on his head . It is a dark gray homburg that brings out the nicely sprinkled silver at his temples . <p> He has the Bruegel folded neatly in his pocket and will take these pages home to study further . <p> Thousands remain in the stands , not nearly ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aimless eddies and stirrings , single figures sprinting out of crowds . Edgar sees someone dangling from the wall in right-center field . These men who drop from the high walls like to hang for a while before letting go . They hit the ground and crumple and get up slowly . But it 's the static drama of the dangled body that Edgar finds compelling , the terror of second thoughts . <p> Gleason is on his feet now , crapulous Jack all rosy and afloat , ready to lead his buddies up the aisle . <p> He rails at Frank . " Nothing personal , pal , but I wonder if you realize you 're smelling up the ballpark . Talk about stinko . I can smell you even with Shor on the premises . Usually with Shor around , blind people are tapping for garbage cans in their path . " <p> Shor thinks this is funny . Light comes into his eyes and his face goes crinkly . He loves the insults , the slurs and taunts , and he stands there beaming with love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain mind  --  the stand-up scorn that carries their affections . <p> But what about Frank ? He says , " It 's not my stink . It 's your stink , pal . Just happens I am the one that 's wearing it . " <p> Says Gleason , " Hey . Do n't think you 're the first friend I ever puked on . I puked on better men than you . Consider yourself honored . This is a form of flattery I extend to nearest and dearest . " Here he waves his cigarette . " But do n't think I am riding in any limousine that has you in it . " <p> They march toward the exit ramp with Edgar going last . He turns toward the field on an impulse and sees another body dropping from the outfield wall , a streaky length of limbs and hair and flapping sleeves . There is something apparitional in the moment and it chills and excites him and sends his hand into his pocket to touch the bleak pages hidden there . <p> Cotter walks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that always falls too fast . He goes past rows of tenements down Eighth Avenue and sees the Power of Prayer sign and the stray dogs that come slinking out of side streets to crap in the traffic of people . <p> He carries the ball in his right hand and rubs it up several times with both hands pressed to his belt , an automatic gesture of protection . <p> Bill calls out , " Hey Cotter buddy come on , we won this game together . " <p> Many people have disappeared into cars or down the subways , they are swarming across the walkway on the bridge to the Bronx , but there are still enough bodies to disrupt traffic in the streets . The mounted police are out , high-riding and erect , appearing among the cars as levitated beings . <p> Bill says , " Hey we had a bet , remember . Fair 's fair , you know . " <p> Bill and the college boy in synchronized stride . They go past the stoops where people stand and sit and distantly watch , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What bet ? " Cotter calls back . " That was you buy me a hot dog . We never finished saying the rest of the bet . " <p> " That was I buy you a hot dog , you give me the baseball . " <p> Bill laughs the instant he says it . They both laugh and Cotter begins to like the man all over again . Car horns are blowing all along the street , noises of joy and mutual salute . <p> Bill carries his suit jacket clutched and bunched in his hand , wadded up like something he might want to throw . <p> " Hey Cotter I had my hand on that ball before you did . " <p> Cotter keeps to the curbstone fifteen yards ahead of them with people passing in between . He 'd like to stop and get a close look at a horse , a cop on a horse  --  this is something he could study for a while . <p> Bill calls out , " Right is right , Cotter . I had the ball in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second but I had it and you know it . There 's bound to be some law of prior right . What do you think ? Talk to me , buddy . " <p> And the college boy says , " I think it 's time I got in this . I 'm in this too . I was the first one to grab ahold of the ball . Actually long before either one of you . Somebody hit it out of my hand . I mean if we 're talking about who was first . " <p> Cotter is watching the college boy speak , looking back diagonally . He sees Bill stop , so he stops . Bill is stopping for effect . He wants to stop so he can measure the college boy , look him up and down in an itemizing way . In other words this is someone who has been stealing along the edge of Bill 's attention and now it is time to swing him around to the front . That 's what Bill is doing and Cotter stops to watch . Bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , he is taking in the whole boy , the entire form and structure of the college boy 's status as a land animal with a major brain . <p> And he says , " What ? " That 's all . A hard sharp what . <p> " I had the ball in my hand in the first pile-up . Somebody knocked it out , you know ? I mean there 's no reason I should surrender my right . I mean if we 're talking about who had first possession . If there 's a criterion here and if that 's the criterion . Then I want to be considered . " <p> Bill has not yet finished taking the measure of the boy . He stands there agape , his body gone slack in a comic dumbness that 's pervaded with danger , and he looks at the college boy , he examines him point by point as if to espy the secret reason for his astonishing remarks . <p> He says , " Who the hell are you anyway ? What are you doing here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and watches like a fool . He is entertained by the look on the college boy 's face . The college boy thought he was part of a team  --  you know , two against one , us against him . Now his eyes do n't know where to go . <p> Bill says , " This is between my buddy Cotter and me . Personal business , understand ? We do n't want you here . You 're ruining our fun . And if I have to make it any plainer , there 's going to be a family sitting down to dinner tonight minus a loved one . " <p> Bill resumes walking and so does Cotter . He looks back to see the college boy following Bill for a number of paces , unsurely , and then falling out of step and beginning to fade down the street and into the crowd . <p> " Hey Cotter now let 's be honest . You snatched it out of my hand . A clear case of snatch and run . But I 'm willing to be reasonable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talk turkey hey ? I want to make an offer . What do you say to ten dollars in crisp bills ? That 's a damn fair offer . Twelve dollars . You can buy a ball and a glove for that . " <p> " That 's what you think . " <p> " All right , whatever it takes . Let 's find a store and go right in . A fielder 's glove and a baseball . You got sporting goods stores around here ? Hell , we won the game of our lives . There 's cause for celebration . " <p> " The ball 's not for sale . Not this ball . " <p> " What do you plan to do with it ? You 'll stick it in a drawer , okay ? I 'll get you a new ball . " <p> " But it wo n't be this ball . " <p> Bill says , " Let me tell you something , Cotter . " <p> Then he pauses , not sure what it is he wants to tell the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My arm needs attention in a big way . You really put the squeeze on me . " Here he uses one arm to support the other , extending the second arm toward Cotter , hand swinging limp . " Contusion , that 's the word I want . You contused my arm something fierce . " <p> " Lucky I did n't bite . " <p> " Oh really ? Tell me more . " <p> " I could of bitten . I had a bite all ready if nothing else worked . " <p> " It was in your plans , was it ? " <p> Bill grins , he seems delighted at the way Cotter has entered the spirit of the moment . The crowd is thinning quickly now . Cotter goes past the last of the mounted police down around a Hundred and Forty-eighth Street . The side streets are weary with uncollected garbage and broken glass , with the odd plundered car squatting flat on its axle and men who stand in doorways completely adream . <p> Bill runs toward Cotter , he takes four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and a movie growl rolling from his throat . Cotter sees it is a joke but not until he has run into the street and done a loop around a passing car . They smile at each other across the traffic . Then Cotter crosses all the way to the east side of the avenue with Bill following on . <p> " I looked at you scrunched up in your seat and I thought I 'd found a pal . He 's a shy kid that wears glasses . He roots for the right team . Not like so many others . These kids , these days . This is a baseball fan , I thought . Not some delinquent in the streets , a petty thief that does people out of things that are rightfully theirs . Baseball is what saves kids from mean lives . Understand what I 'm saying ? We had a big day together at the ballpark and now you 're dead set on disappointing me . Cotter ? Buddies sit down together and work things out . They find a way to reach an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are walking briskly now and Cotter is n't sure who was first to step up the pace . He feels a pain in his back at the spot where the seat leg was digging in . <p> " Now tell me what it 's going to take to separate you from that baseball , son . " <p> Cotter does n't like the tone of this . <p> " I want that cotton-pickin ' ball . " <p> Cotter keeps walking . <p> " Hey goofus I 'm talking to you . You maybe think this is some cheapo entertainment . String the guy along . " <p> " You can talk all you want , " Cotter says . " The ball 's not yours , it 's mine . I 'm not selling it or trading it . " <p> The next words come with substantial spacing . <p> " Do n't be so god-damn al-mighty nigger-ish . Not with me , okay ? " <p> Then Bill pauses , he stops cold and looks up and away in a dumb show of self-exasperation  --  a pained regret in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk , arms flat at his sides , and Cotter stands and waits . <p> " Look at that now , Cotter . Aw Christ , you made me say the word . Goddamn , you made me say it and there 's no forgiving the fact , is there ? Aw shit , good Christ , but I 'd a never said it if you had n't made me . Jesus in heaven , I 'm completely mortified . " <p> They are both walking again , slowly now . <p> " You have to tell me we 're still friends . Cotter , I 'm depending on you to tell me it 's okay . I said the goddamn word and I swear I did n't mean it . " <p> A car comes veering off the avenue and Cotter stops to let it go by . He sees the driver is a Puerto Rican in a black cap . Then he feels something shift around him . There 's a ripple in the pavement or the air and a scant second in a woman 's face nearby  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turns to see Bill coming wide and fast and arm-pumping . It seems awful heavy traffic for a baseball . The color coming into Bill 's face , the shiny fabric at his knees . He has a look that belongs to someone else entirely , a man out of another experience , desperate and prop <p>
