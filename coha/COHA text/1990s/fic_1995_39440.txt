Hard to believe how popular I was . At Mt . Ephraim High School where I was in ninth grade that spring . Counted ten , twelve , sixteen , nineteen new friends Not just boys in my class but popular juniors and seniors , athletes began to notice me , smiled and called me Doll , Doll-girl , Ingrid , In-grie . Word spreads fast , who the good-looking ninth-grade girls are . Asked me on dates , but Momma would n't allow it saying I was too young . Tried to get my phone number to call . Whispering , staring . A guy named Artie in jeans , a T-shirt , biker boots running his thumb along the row of ninth-grade lockers prowling the ninth-grade corridor to check Doll-girl out . But it was the popular boys , a better class of boys I sought . I loved it , their attention That feeling leaves you sick and faint with excitement knowing you 're popular Could n't get enough of it drifting through school corridors between classes as in a dream smiling Hello Hi Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no friends , a horse-faced girl named Bernice who talked about me behind my back saying I had bedbugs , a boy named Jig from Mohawk Street who talked me into kissing him open-mouthed then laughed at me I started to choke and gag and somebody told me he 'd written something nasty about INGRID BOONE in all the boys ' lavatories at school . But I had certain friends I listed their names in code in my notebook with a star by the special ones and there was a special-special list of boys all hearts . And there was a special list growing longer with each passing day of boys and girls who had insulted me , cut me to the heart , these were marked with a skull and crossbones the way the mystery-detective novels were marked at the public library , on their peeling spines . Marked for Death . But truly I was pretty , and I was popular . Girls in my neighborhood were jealous of me the way their mothers were jealous of my mother with her blond hair , her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore , funky little tops and poor-boy sweaters and jeans snug in the rear , now I refused to wear most of what Momma sewed for me , made me look older than I was whatever age I was . And I 'd started to smoke , carried my own cigarettes and a gilt-lettered matchbook from the Yewville Park Lane Hotel where one of Momma 's man friends with money to spend took her certain weekends . And I was smart . My mind rattled on fast as a machine sometimes , ran its own way without my participation . So I 'd know the answer to an algebra problem but not the steps to that answer . Or what a poem like Robert Frost 's " The Road Not Taken " meant but not how to explain it . Stammering and going beet-red if called upon . Even by my English teacher Miss Elsworth who liked me . And the other teachers who were hopeful of me at first then grew impatient , exasperated . My problem was nerves I guess . Too nervous and excited to do well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out and even sometimes if I made this exhausting effort it did no good , my blood beat too hard , my thoughts ran wild . You 're stupid . You 're a bad girl . White trash . Going to hell like every other Boone . This voice I 'd never heard in my life and it was not a voice I acknowledged but at such times taking tests and exams it rang unimpeded in my head like <p> radio you ca n't shut off . But I excelled in take-home assignments and homework in general so a teacher like my social studies teacher Mrs. Hornell would think I was cheating getting help from an older student or a parent and if interrogated about this I stammered and blushed and stared at the floor scarcely able to whisper No . When I did my homework my grades wee A 's except if I lost my homework to some guy grabbing my duffel bag , turning it upside down over the oil-splotched pavement behind the high school teasing me calling me Doll-girl the way they did . Or maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been listening when the teacher gave the assignment . Or I was listening but staring so hard at this guy Foxy sitting sprawled in his desk by the window at the far side of the classroom ignoring me , stared and stared at Foxy who 'd hurt me and never apologized so I did n't hear the teacher 's droning voice . Or it was one of my feverish days scribbling poems in my notebook Poems about love , and dying , and flying high above the earth , and white horses with long streaming manes wild in the mountains . Cascades of words filling up pages in my notebook like the churning channels of water of Tintern Falls you can stare at until you 're hypnotized but you can never determine their pattern except to know there is a pattern inside the falls . Or maybe I was n't writing poems at all , maybe I was scribbling love letters to Foxy who had kissed me and run his hands over me and said he was crazy for me then hurt me squeezing my breast , turned mean when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I burst into tears , and he never apologized Not a one of them ever apologized Or letters to Dale , or Bibi , or Dorie , or Rich , or Carrie Kimble the " captain " of the varsity cheerleaders ' " squad "  --  the senior girl I would have traded my soul , of all the girls of Mt . Ephraim High , to be . Or letters to Mr. Quincy our algebra teacher I wanted so desperately to please . Homely frog-face with his mean little bored half-smile , leaning his chin on his hand every day and his eyes trailing over most of his students in pity and contempt but I loved Mr. Quincy , I was terrorized by him , a clammy sweat broke out over me and my brain shuddered to a stop when he announced with his mocking smile Spot quiz Take out a clean sheet of paper and put away your books From Ingrid Boone a paper with so many corrections and X 'd out problems it was virtually unreadable and no surprise when the quiz came back marked F-in red felt-tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me with the usual F-but also that time a swirling indignant question mark through my scrawled INGRID BONE  --  I had misspelled my own name And Mr. Quincy staring at me hunched and thumbnail-biting in my seat like I was white trash as hopeless as Bernice Urken . Or I might be writing to Miss Elsworth my English teacher who was the only teacher who liked me though the fact that she liked me qualified her in my eyes . Or I might be writing to " Bunny " Heinz the boys ' gym coach who ran my afternoon study hall like a drill sergeant on TV , wisecracking and harsh and unpredictable in his moods . Or I might be writing to our principal Mr. Cantry who led us in the Pledge of Allegiance at Friday assemblies with a high ringing sincere voice pressing his right hand against his fattish torso like an upright hog , the kind of man you ca n't help wanting to please . Wanting to impress so one day maybe he 'd smile saying Hello Ingrid in the hall like he did with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not popular and I was not a good student but I had my plans , my schemes . If I 'd swallowed a diet pill or two given to me by my girlfriend Bonnie ( I 'd trade her cigarettes , five Newports for one pill ) these schemes seemed to me very plausible , it was only a matter of making them happen but being patient , too . The main thing was : I had a glen-plaid wool jacket similar to one worn by a pretty red-haired JV cheerleader named Gail Ellen Ryan . And sheepskin-lined boots similar to boots worn by Carrie Kimble . These were imitations of the real things but nobody would look closely would they . Bought on sale at the Hitching Post where after school I browsed with my friends Sandy , Denise , Bonnie giggling trying on outfits in the dressing rooms working up our courage to steal ( you 'd put on layers of clothes under your own ) but the bitchy salesgirls had our number spying on us so we 'd stroll over to Bar-B-Q Diner where we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys sliding into our booth in the back right corner grinning at us especially me Hi Ingrid Got room for me , In-grie ? Some jokes about my name and BOONE which the guys would mumble-moan BOOOOONNNNE but I ignored them . Things said of me or scrawled on walls but how would I know what , and why care . And we 'd smoke our cigarettes , drink Cokes fizzing with caffeine till my head buzzed and we 'd laugh , laugh like hyenas . Bonnie 's sister 's diet pills , real prescription pills Bonnie stole a few at a time , plus the caffeine : WOW Talking screwing around with these cool guys , could n't break away , why lots of nights I did n't do my homework or if I 'd already done it in study hall it was taken from me for somebody else 's use . Or just taken , ripped or tossed away . Funny Wild And if the guys took us to movies at the mall , a show starting at 5:15 p.m. getting out at 7:30 p.m . And in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't know slipped his arm around your shoulders and began to kiss you forcing your head back like he wanted to snap your neck forcing your mouth open so there was the terror of choking on his tongue alive and thrusting like an eel , and his sudden fingers between your legs , poking , pinching , and if you began to choke , or clawed at his hand , or thrashed your head from side to side panicked trying to escape he would lean back panting in his seat whispering Shit then get up and walk away . Or if a guy had a car or his daddy 's pickup and asked to drive you home . And you knew it was an asshole thing to do but you said Sure Beer cans opened in the parking lot , warm beer in dribbles down your chin . A single can and you 're dizzy , two cans and you 're what the guys called smashed . That tone of admiration and approval like Momma 's drunk-marveling voice : smashed . And there was the old quarry road off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree limbs heavy with snow and you squealed with laughter the car bounced so , bounced and rattled on its high tires , and already it was dark , it was night and no stars and car 's lurching headlights and you 'd just gotten out of school , you 'd been expected to drop by Flora Wells 's to meet up with your mother for some purpose long forgotten . Oh oh oh  --  waiting to see if he would drive the clumsy car too far , skid out onto the quarry ice and the ice would shatter beneath the weight of the car and you would all sink , drown a hideous death in freezing water . That trucker behind his windshield gazing , up , a pilot behind his windshield gazing up , grinning , waiting . Doll-girl , do me , huh ? You know how ? Do n't play dumb . How they would go from moaning how beautiful you are , how crazy they are for you to that sound of reproach and threat , it was always a surprise . But the kissing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a guy 's strong hands cradling your head , stroking your hair , gazing at you close-up like a lover on TV or in the movies like you exist , you are there . But sometimes the hands were hurtful , and the guy too drunk and you 're not smashed enough not to be scared , and running stumbling sobbing and puking beer across a snowy debris-littered field to the rear of a neighbor 's house and so through to Mohawk Street and back home where Momma was not waiting anyway . And next morning Momma bleary-eyed and pissed examining the glen-plaid jacket , sniffing the beer-vomit you 've tried to wash out . Ingrid ?  --  what the hell are you up to ? But by then the panic was not only gone but forgotten . The swimming eyes and bruised mouth . Kept a scrupulous record of boys I " dated " but it was n't always clear if these episodes had happened yet or were meant to happen someday soon . But if it had happened it had happened and was over with . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with another time or something on TV or in a movie . Because I was smart : reasoning I could n't be pregnant , the stuff that came out of him I knew to call sperm had n't gone in . Just dribbled on my thighs , in my pubic fuzz . Where I 'd touched it afterward examining it on my finger , just  --  nothing . Clear wetness a little sticky , and no smell . Like a more transparent snot . But not nasty like snot . Reasoning too I was too skinny , tiny breasts and my pelvic bones jutting , I was thirteen years old and had n't begun " my periods " yet one of the last girls in the ninth grade according to the girls ' gym teacher who kept a weird record of such things . And how strange to me that my face was so different to the outer eye than I knew it to be from inside . My fevered skin , that itched and demanded scratching . I would stare in amazement at my reflection in any mirrored surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of joke . Unless it was a trick . But who was playing the trick ? The girls ' lavatory bluish-foul with smoke though smoking was forbidden so I would lean close to the mirror in wonder as if to kiss the staring blond girl with the wide-set brown eyes lightly threaded with veins but the skin actually clear-looking . My God am I pretty ?  --  how is it possible I am pretty ? Discovering then a tiny red pimple beside my mouth , a budding dull-red lump at my hairline . C'n I borrow a cigarette , Ingrid ? <p> girl would ask and my heart would swell in pride . Sure Take two . How proud I was counting five , six , nine , eleven girlfriends . And more boys asking me out , or following me home . But were these girls I could trust ?  --  what were they saying behind my back ? Their eyes narrowing when I passed by them in the cafeteria , smirking when Miss Elsworth read my essay " Winter Riverscape " to the class , a conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of friendships at Mt . Ephraim High I was beginning to learn . But I would never give up . Each morning vowing to make a new friend , or anyway to try . Could be a girl or a boy , in ninth grade , or tenth , or eleventh , or most prized of all a senior . Because in fact I had no friends , not a single girl not even Bernice . Not a single boy who would not betray me . But I forced myself to smile like Carrie Kimble H'lo Dale Hi Dorie Hi Foxy moving in the noontime crush jostled along the corridor to the cafeteria my eyes stark and staring as a zombie 's . And later in the day taking a certain stairs hurrying from one end of the hall to the other where Kirk Belknap who was a senior dark-haired and good-looking a basketball player with a terrific smile left his biology class to go downstairs to his sixth period class which was gym and by chance I would be headed downstairs too beside him , or as close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking and laughing with his friends he might not hear so I would say a little louder HI KIRK and he would glance back at me quizzical and possibly a little annoyed not recognizing me or not remembering my name but mumbling Yeah , hi reddening as one of his buddies poked him in the ribs and the guys moved on together eyeing Doll-girl in that way that scared and excited me like somebody bringing a lighted match up close to my hair : WOW And one afternoon after school there was Kirk in his car cruising the curb where I was walking by myself and he leaned out his window asking in the nicest voice how 'd I like a ride home ? And I could not believe my eyes who it was , I must have stared amazed and there was a beat or two before I managed to say Sure  --  thanks and lots of people were watching , girls stricken with envy , and we rode around talking and smoking cigarettes and listening to the radio and Kirk told me all sorts of things about himself I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor ministering unto the poor someday , possibly in the Peace Corps , and he had three basketball scholarships offered him by colleges but could n't make up his mind which one to accept , and he 'd had bad luck with girls , in his opinion at least , there was always some hurt feelings and misunderstandings and he was damned if he caught on why . Driving in sleety rain north of Mt . Ephraim and along the river following the railroad tracks the way I remembered from some other time unless it was a dream I was remembering , so sweet . And we stopped at a place that sold fishermen 's supplies plus beer and liquor and the owner seemed to know Kirk so sold him two six-packs of ale though he was underage , this strong dark ale like nothing I had ever tasted before Kirk said takes getting used to . And in a hidden place we parked above the river and drank and talked and laughed listening to the radio and I was snuggled in Kirk 's arms like I 'd been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was gentle like no other kissing of my life but like kissing on TV or in the movies and Kirk was saying over and over like the lyrics of a song Ingrid you 're so pretty Ingrid you 're so special and he groaned he was so crazy for me , wanted me so , and it was a long time later I tried to wake up pushing , his hands away where he was inside my clothes and he 'd opened his trousers like some of the guys want to but Kirk was gentle , saying Ingrid ?  --  let 's go in the back seat okay ? and I saw how big his penis was , big for me , I was proud how big it was for me , and I was sleepy and sort of sickish saying Gee I do n't know maybe I should go back home ? and Kirk said But honey I love you , I 'm crazy about you and I said in this slow dazed voice Gee I do n't know , I guess not but he was n't listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and we never needed to go into the back seat . <p>
