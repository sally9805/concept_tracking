Della <p> She feels the first pain when she bends over the potato hill . She straightens , then moves down the row , leaving mounds of russets behind her . It is a good crop with no scab or mildew . Along with parsnips , onions , and squash , the potatoes will keep in the cellar well into spring . The next pain drops her to her knees . Then she knows and goes in the house . Jars of freshly canned apples cover the table , their packed quarters swathed in a sugary syrup with specks of cinnamon that shine through the glass . <p> The seventh child , a girl , born on her forty-second birthday , and this baby does not cry , blessed from the beginning with an accommodating disposition , the doctor says . When her neighbor hands the child to her , wrapped in a light cotton blanket , she notices how smooth her face is , almost unscathed by the trauma . Only when the doctor gently folds back the blanket edge and shows her a swelling , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , does she understand something is wrong , something she could never imagine . She does not recoil from it or the strained look in the doctor 's light blue eyes . <p> " You 'll have to take her to the specialist in Spokane . I 'll make an appointment for you . I just do n't know . We ca n't treat these things out here , Della . " He pats her shoulder , and she nods at him , then at George , her husband , knowing there is no money , knowing also that after rantings and denials , somehow he will get them there . She takes the little hand and names her daughter Mary Elizabeth for all the trouble that lies ahead . <p> At six months the doctors drain the sac , now big as a lemon , for the last time . When Mary Elizabeth 's brothers and sisters chase each other around the kitchen , she laughs and rolls in her crib . Sometimes Unis , the eldest , picks her up and dances into the dining room where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeling beige wallpaper . Then she moves her fists up and down against her big sister 's shoulders in excitement and makes her small pink mouth form an " Oooo . " <p> Every morning her eyes follow her father as he puts on his work boots , eats fried potatoes and eggs , then dips his pipe in the Prince Albert tobacco can . He can not resist looking back at her . In spite of himself , he smiles and waves his hand over the crib in acknowledgment as he heads out for morning chores . She has captured him , too . Della smiles but covers her mouth with her hand , so he can show his affection without gruff denial , so he can savor the gentlest of loves . <p> One morning when he rises , Mary Elizabeth 's eyes remain closed . He reaches across her bed for the overalls hung on a nail , then touches the cool baby flesh . He turns away hard and leaves the room . <p> " Della . " <p> She hears her name as the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before with the rawness of a knife scraping bone . <p> It is not as if she did not know the day would come . It is not as if her prayers were to somehow escape from the pain , old and new at the same time . It is just the finality-separation . She picks her child up , looks into her still face , and feels her merge with another little girl , a child with smoky eyes and a large bow in her hair . Ten years old , but George carries his daughter into the photographer 's studio in Lewiston , for she no longer has the strength to climb stairs . Sepia tones make the solemn face still graver , and no degree of beauty shields the viewer from thin white-stockinged legs beneath the dark pleats of her low-waist dress , from the sunken cheeks . Their first child-Lydia . <p> Born nine months after the marriage , Lydia watches her father with the same curious brown eyes that Mary Elizabeth brings to him twenty-five years later . Like Mary Elizabeth , she entrances him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his detachments and worships her with unguarded love . <p> Almost two years later , there is another girl child and then another though Della knows George needs a boy to help with farmwork . He grumbles about the cost of a hired man because he has no sons , but Della catches him standing beside the lilac bush , mesmerized by his three girls at play after Sabbath services , the prairie wind lifting their starched white dresses as they race through the orchard . Often she hears him tease them as they try chasing the hens off their nests to collect eggs . The youngest , still in diapers , calls out , " Wait for me , Daddy , wait , " until he sets her on his shoulders . When Lydia grows weaker and weaker , her heart unable to survive the ravages of rheumatic fever , something shuts off in him , something the sons who come later never replace . <p> Today this is her only comfort-that Lydia was not afraid , that she somehow knew she would not live and told her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone stronger , filled with vigor , to take her place . And he did , a first son , never sick , and then two more , the last a towhead with thick curls covering his forehead . <p> Now there is this little one who almost never cried- " the best little baby in the world , " Unis always said when she took her baby sister in her arms and made up songs for her-gone , too . <p> Only one day , and her breasts burn with the loss , the unwanted milk . She stands by the black cookstove , hums " Jewels for a Crown " as she stirs potato soup for dinner and sets clover buns on the table . Unis tells the boys to stop cutting up and wash their hands . Then it 's quiet , unnatural . Without turning , she knows they are staring at her . <p> She hears Unis whisper to George at the door . " She 's got an extra place at the table , like she used to do after Lydia . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes his head- " Do n't talk about it , Della " - takes one setting off the table , and starts spreading butter on his whole wheat bun . They are with us , still with us , she wants to say , only you can not take it in yet . He refuses to look up , and she is left alone with the spirits of her dead children , her feelings for them again dammed up inside . <p> In the morning , there is the pounding of the last nails in Mary Elizabeth 's tiny coffin . George works in the cold with his rough but still beautiful hands , so different from hers , the almond-shaped fingertips more suited to accounting , the work he once did , than to struggling with wood and farm implements . It is the life he wants . She has always helped him , pitching hay through July , shocking grain in the fall . The days the harvest crew comes , she stops and cooks for them : canned Sweet Ann cherries ; cottage cheese cooled at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes and gravy ; smooth lemon pies . But when she stays in the field alongside him , they settle for bread soaked in milk and applesauce . <p> She 's heard what his family thinks of it , at least the sister . " Now he 's gone and married some peasant girl who ca n't even set a proper table-works like a field hand . " <p> As if she chooses to labor until she can barely stand , then nurse her baby , feed and wash her children . <p> " And he had a future , an education-all wasted on that scrubby piece of land he filed for when he met her . " <p> She has watched George 's sister clean china and silver while her husband 's mules drag plows over two thousand acres of hot , rich bottom land . They can afford a carriage , purebred riding horses , a house with the biggest veranda in town . She sees the difference between her sister-in-law 's delicate , protected face and her own broad , tanned one , senses how crude her efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George 's obsession with a thirty-year-old married woman got out of hand , indiscreet , forced him to leave Tennessee , that he compromised his bank job over that . Never mind that he did not regret it , showed no concern for what the rumors cost him or his sister-all this before she ever knew him . It is the pleasure he finds leading a team of horses , sewing grain sacks that takes him away from ledgers and banking offices now . Still , they blame her , and the accusation stings . <p> From the first time she saw him at Morrowtown , when her father finished driving the water wagon for harvest crews and there was time to go for supplies , she knew he was connected to this land , to her . He did not speak , but it was the same as if he had . She could tell by the way he leaned against the hotel railing while his eyes played with the reins she held , intent and amused at the same time . She looked straight back . <p> This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , like the time she walked on the hillside and the light of God-she had no other name for it-reached down and touched her . The next time it happened , she was at church , sitting on a plain wood pew , her feet planted on the pine floor . What streamed through the open window at Sabbath service that morning felt the same . Was it the morning sun that brought on the knowing ? That 's what her sister said , but Mable had a way of downplaying everything that did n't center on her . When the newspaper story about two newlyweds traveling on the just completed Camas Railroad came out , she showed it to Mable . Married five hours before , the groom had stepped from the back of the train , and when it crossed the wooden trestle two hundred feet over Lawyer 's Creek , he jumped . Mable said he probably just wanted some fresh air and slipped . <p> She and George got married in January by the justice of the peace because he could n't wait , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up stranded three days in Morrowtown , surrounded by snowbound wheat fields and a frozen granary . It seemed fitting that a blizzard would hold them there , give her time to take in the beauty of their lives in winter . For those three days he worshiped her , could not get enough of looking and touching . When it dropped to twenty below , a farmer asked for help with an old bull who got his front legs stuck in the feed bin and nearly froze because he could n't move . He went then , but only for an hour . <p> She knew the natural world acted as a vehicle , a way to get at something deeper , just like her father 's wagon brought water to laboring men at harvest . The sun let something or someone tell her there was more to life than she could ever imagine , and she should n't forget it . She never did . And she never ate pork again , either , abiding by the Seventh Day Adventist injunction just in case some connection existed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty years . She folds her strong , square hands in her lap and watches George load the coffin on the wagon , turn the horses into the ice-covered road , the driving wind . It is not a new sight ; grimness has rolled past the window for days-one wagon after another with victims of a flu epidemic that will not end . No funerals now , no gatherings of any kind allowed in the hope that isolation will halt the pestilence . And there is always someone worse off-worse for the Indians who have no resistance , who go to the sweat lodges in their pain and fever , then jump in the cold river or creek , dying in droves , probably from pneumonia the doctor says . The remedy of centuries no longer suffices . They will not stop ; it is all they have . <p> She suffers for her husband , going alone to place his last child in the halffrozen earth and refusing to be comforted , going alone with that dead weary look in his eyes . But she sees the spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb , sweet Jesus , on her sister 's grave . She turns before the frozen wheat field , goes up the dirt road through the gate , through pine trees that distract the wind . Morrowtown cemetery . Place of death but also of beginning , the same wheat fields where she first felt the power of a man within her . It was more than ecstasy , this conception . <p> He will not let her tell him how Lydia prayed , how she laughed even then and saw past her own end . He will not let her even say Lydia 's name , so she holds all the truth of it in , waits for the day when he will listen and not shut out what a child has meant to him , still means , for the day when he will grieve outright . She waits for the time when he will know there is more in one child loving him than logic and reason or anything the skeptics who taught him at that New York Academy , filling his head with geology and Darwin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it is in the very earth he labors over and loves , in the new spring grain and the deep , plowed earth . <p> The first and the last-gone now . She sits at the black organ with its ornate carving and chipped ivory keys and pumps out " What a Friend We Have in Jesus , " while her rich alto voice fills the room . She sings for the tiny soul who can have no funeral with all the sickness and dying around and the fear of it . A song is the single thing she has left to give . Music wells up in her body , a last tangible link between them , for she knows God will let her tiny daughter hear . Then she straightens , looks at Lydia 's picture and realizes there will never even be one of these for Mary Elizabeth . Beside the window , she holds her Bible and reads a poem from the Morning Watch calendar . <p> Never fretful are these treasures , Hills and vales . . . <p> Ice clings to the pear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind can sever . When the clouds move away and sun spills over the orchard , warming it to just above freezing , the tree looks bejeweled . Then darkness rolls back , obscuring the vision . Sleet tackles the window . But she sees no divisions ; both solace and grief hang like half-frozen drops from the pear tree limbs . <p>
