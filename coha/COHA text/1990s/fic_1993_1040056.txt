" Mann shook his head decisively . " No way , Solly . I ai n't never seen him before . " " He is an agent of our enemies , those minions of Rylieh who seek to profit from the teachings of Our Lord . He came to me , asking of Kinbarn . " The Bishop of Chartres entered the room . He wore local garb , loose flowing trousers and vest , but still had his cross dangling in the middle of his chest . It sounded as if R. E. Mann had really sold him a bill of goods , coming off as Mr. Clean . " Rylieh ! " Mann 's face tried to turn as purple as his shirt , and almost made it . " That scumbag 's been giving me a real pain . Particularly Egypt . We divided up the territory , but he 's trying to horn in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small operator ? Did Belle Zebub send you ? She 's got the monopoly on the Pharisees . Small sect , but really popular , for some reason . Ah , screw it . Alphonse , get ' im ! " There was suddenly a huge figure behind me . How did people keep sneaking up on me ? He took hold of me , gently . I felt like I had been welded into an Iron Maiden . He was about twice the size of the two goons from Akhetaten . He had a tiny head whose only apparent purpose was anchoring neck muscles . With a turban on it looked like a bandaged thumb . He caught me looking at him and hit me . I got the idea , and stopped looking at him . " What luck ! " Mann said . " Ngargh was thinking of buying Thuggee , the ritual murder cult of the goddess Kali , but I told him we were fresh out of demonstration models . I think we can put it back in the catalog . " He began to stalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Silken strangling cords , silken strangling cords , " he muttered . " How come nothing ever stays put around here ? " He looked up at all of us . " Do n't just stand there . Stick him in a cell . Hell , let him pick out some last rites for himself , on the house . " He winked at me . " No one ever called R. E. Mann a cheapie . Enjoy yourself . " Alphonse hauled me downstairs and threw me into a room the size of a gym locker that smelled of urine and pain . The door slammed shut and left me in total darkness . I leaned against the rough stone walls and decided that , at long last , I could not console myself with the thought that things might be worse . The Bishop looked worried . Extremely worried . " You are a Cath-olic ? " He spoke to me through a slot in the door .  | " Yes , of course , " I lied . " You can not allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , as well as I could within the confines of that tiny cell . " Wait , wait , " he said . I could tell I 'd called him right , from what I had seen and heard that night , when he 'd gone to Kinbarn 's monk 's cell with Martin . He was a genuine and convinced Christian . " If you are a Catholic , why do you not help us in our struggle to convert the ignorant races of the galaxy ? " Oho . So that was it . The urge to proselytize is a dangerous one . The Bishop was bagging souls and racking up an immense score , not realizing the hollowness of his triumph . Martin had known the truth . " I pursued Kinbarn , " I said , " because of the sacrilege he had committed , to assist in Mann 's marketing plans . " A sharp indrawn breath . " What sacrilege ? " " He stole the true Tunic of the Virgin , put a false one in its place . The true Tunic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the galaxy . " " You lie ! It is the same relic that has been there since I can remember . I was almost convinced by your ? " " The Tunic was switched long before your time , at least before the fire , forty years ago , your time . There are other wormholes to Chartres , you realize . If you wish to find the real Tunic , it lies among Mann 's loot , upstairs . It lies on top of ? " I was talking to empty air . The Bishop was gone . But the door was still locked . A few minutes later I heard voices . It was Rachel and Solomon , who had decided on the hallway leading to my cell as a convenient place to argue . " I warned you , " she said . " I told you it was dangerous , that it was a sacrilege . The search for knowledge is God 's work , ' you said . Selling your soul is the Devil 's work , ' I said . Now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Solomon said miserably . " We will leave now , and return to our shtetl in Chelm . It was so green there . " He sighed . " I never thought that I would miss Poland . " " Leave ? And allow that abomination to continue its foul existence ? The golden calf , Aaron 's sin , right before your eyes . How can you ignore it ? " Solomon groaned . " Oh , God , I should have stuck with my study of the Talmud . It is so much less complicated . " " That 's what I told you . " " I know , I know . " " Hey ! " I said . " I can help you . "  | They stopped their argument and came up to the door to my cell . " How can you help us ? " Solomon said , hope coming into his voice . " He ca n't , " Rachel said venomously . I felt like hitting her . " He 's just one of Mann 's competitors . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no different . " " You 're wrong . I 'm not like the others , " I said . " I 'm an agent of the Constabulary . I 'm after Kinbarn . " The slot opened up and Solomon peered in , eyes wide . " The Constabulary ? Why are you after Kinbarn ? He 's just a runner , small fry . " " I 've figured that out , finally . Do n't you know how hard it is to police an entire planet over five hundred millennia ? Let me tell you , it 's a real bitch . " I realized I was sounding querulous , but figured I 'd earned it . " It 's a wonder we get anything done at all . Particularly stuck in a cell in the basement of a building in seventeenth-century Isfahan . Now if you just let me out ? " Rachel muttered something that indicated that she was still suspicious about my bona fides , but Solomon simply said , " How ? " " Do I have to think of everything ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before I could think of a wise reply , we all heard the stair creak beneath an abnormally heavy step . Solomon and Rachel vanished . The door groaned open , and Alphonse hauled me out of the cell . He carried me up to the top floor , kneeled me down , tied my hands and feet , and left me alone with Mann and Ngargh . Mann held a scarlet silk cord in his hands . He stroked it . " See how it clings , Ngargh ? " he said . " Only the best ones do that . " He put it around my neck . Ngargh watched with interest . " Doing this is a little tricky . It 's harder than it looks . When you 're done with the messy part , there 's a few chants , the consecration of the pickax , and the sacrifice of sugar . Nothing to it , really , but it makes for a nice change of pace . " " Do proceed , " Ngargh said . The cord tightened . Suddenly , the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Standing in the doorway was an awe-inspiring figure . It was the Bishop of Chartres , in the full glory of ecclesiastical vestments , chasuble and stole in gold and scarlet , a mitre on his head , and a gold crosier in his hand . For the first time since I 'd seen him , he was unmistakably a Bishop . He made the sign of the cross at us . " My house shall be called a house of prayer , but you have made it a den of thieves , " he thundered. p 103 " Save it for the marks , Bishop , " Mann said , as he picked the cord back up . " Close the door , you 're letting in a draft . " " You have committed a gross sacrilege and are beyond forgiveness , R. E. Mann . " Mann looked irritated . " Hey look , Bishop , do n't you know your own product ? Forgiveness is one of the biggest selling points of ? " The heavy gold-encrusted crosier made a misleadingly soft thunk as it struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , where he lay sprawled and unconscious . Ngargh backed into the opposite corner , trembling . " I believe I expressed an interest in some rather less violent devotions . Zen Buddhism , for example . This is not to my liking . No , no indeed . " The Bishop stared at what he had done , now at a loss . There was a huge crash and someone else came through the door , though he did n't bother to open it first . It was Alphonse , who came through as if fired from a cannon . A very large cannon . He fell on his back but was on his feet in an instant , completely unaffected by his unusual mode of entry . Rachel and Solomon ran in after him . They darted around Alphonse like rabbits around a bear . Rachel grabbed his knee , barely having to bend down to do so , and Solomon bounced high into the air and kicked him at the angle of his jaw . His head snapped back . Rachel 's fingers went under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played soccer with his head for a while , and he was finally silent . I was not able to do anything but kneel and watch , which was fine , because there was no way I could have helped . Solomon came up behind me and cut my bonds with a knife . " Where did you learn to do that ? " I asked . " Where I grew up , Polish soldiers are a constant problem . We are not allowed to carry arms , but we have learned to deal with it . " As an afterthought , he walked over and punched Ngargh , who fell over , kicked once , and was still . " Now we must try to escape with our lives . " The Bishop shrugged out of his robes . " These are most strange , " he said . " So soft , like a lady 's undergarments . Satin and silk . See ? " I felt the material . It did indeed feel like lingerie , though how the Bishop knew what lingerie felt like I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a moment it came to me . " Ah , " I said , " sixteenth-century Italian . Borgias , Medicis . They did believe in comfort in everything , even their vestments , when their families succeeded in making them a Bishop . " I smiled to myself . Did wearing these make the Bishop of Chartres a transvestmentite ? I suppose that that then made Kinbarn a transectual . I wished there were  | someone around to appreciate the joke , though on second thought I suspected that such a person might be hard to find . Solomon and Rachel took some time to destroy the golden calf . It turned out to be gold sheet over a figure of wood , which broke satisfyingly into splinters . When they had finished , Solomon led us all through several back passages and out into the street . At his insistence , we carried Mann along with us . He would not listen to any arguments to the contrary , and he and the Bishop seemed to have reached some sort of agreement , so I was outvoted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth . We crossed over the tree-lined Chahar Bagh , the avenue that led south , and into a tangle of houses and shops . Several passersby stopped to stare at us and our burden . " Poor fat Mustafa , " Solomon said sadly , loudly enough for everyone to hear . " The heat . Too much wine . " " A load , " I said , enjoying the act . " He is a great , sodden load . " " His wives will slaughter us , " Solomon said . " But as his friends , we have no choice . " " Woe is us , " I agreed . " His wives are cruel . " " And he is heavy . " Our litany turned the unconscious body of Mann from a victim into a figure of fun . Shopkeepers laughed and waved to us , and small boys ran alongside , making fun of fat Mustafa . Solomon cuffed them and chased them away . " Insolent children ! Do not make fun of your elders . " We entered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face grave . He then signaled to us , and we brought the body forward . Gently , maintaining a precise angle , he rolled it toward the wall . It was a difficult matter to send someone through a wormhole without actually carrying him through yourself . Mann , just waking up and muttering , vanished down the wormhole . I looked up at Solomon . Sweat had beaded his brow , and he was shaking . Rachel , silent for once , rubbed his back . The Bishop avoided my glance . " It is a terrible thing , " Solomon said . " But necessary . " I was starting to suspect something . " Where did you send him ? " " A place , " he said . " A certain place . " " Where ? " He stared off into space . " I told you that there are certain wormhole exits known to local inhabitants , who use them for their own purposes , like those men who attacked you . The other end of this wormhole is in Mexico , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our calendar , 1543 by yours . The Spaniards have everywhere prohibited the old religion , which entails human p 105 sacrifice to the god Huitzilopochtli . The sacrifice is followed by a cannibal ritual , an important part of the diet of the priesthood . Victims have grown scarce . Yet a small temple survives , even flourishes , in a hidden valley , a place where mysterious people suddenly appear from nowhere . " I thought about Mann 's fate and shuddered . He 'd somehow never realized his game of religion had turned serious . The Bishop choked . " May God have mercy on our souls . " " I would not be surprised if He does n't , " Rachel said . She tugged at Solomon 's sleeve . " Let us go . Chelm is far from here . " Solomon nodded silently and , not looking at us , allowed her to lead him away . They walked out the end of the street , turned the corner , and were gone . The Bishop and I just looked at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached into his shirt , and let me catch just a glimpse of the Tunic of the Virgin . " Martin will aid me in replacing the fraud that lies within the reliquary at the Cathedral . He is an accepting soul , and miracles are of little consequence to him , as they are to any man of true faith . But I have been long enough away , and it is time that I returned . " " Wait , " I said . " I still have a job to finish . Where is Kinbarn ? " He smiled . " Venerating St. Josaphat , as I think you overheard me tell Martin . " Great . Now he was being coy . " Please do n't play games with me , Bishop . " He chuckled . " Ah , how soon humor leaves when the joke concerns ourselves . St. Josaphat is not a true saint . He is based on a rumor of a most holy man , who lived in India . His faith , however , was not Christian , which should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , such things were not always administered with proper rigor . You know him better , perhaps , as Gautama Buddha . " " Thank you very much , your Reverence . " I knelt , and he blessed me . We went through three wormholes , and arrived in Chartres in 1227 . He proceeded to the Cathedral , and I went through the wormhole that led from that time and place to the central highlands of Ceylon , in 810 . St. Josaphat . I should have remembered that . It could have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble . I emerged in a garden . I could n't see it , because it was night there , but I could smell the ponderous aromas of night-blooming flowers and hear the chuckle of a running spring . Birds whooped at each other . The air was warm , and damp , and I stood there waiting while my eyes adjusted to the darkness and the moon rose over the moun-  | ains to light my way . I was on a wide grass-covered path that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ceremonial pool ntended for ritual ablution . My need for washing was considerably pore than symbolic , and I took advantage of it . I had n't had a bath ; ince Rome , however long ago that had been . The trail ran up the hill toward the looming bulbous shapes of lagobas , which housed Buddhist relics . Below me , in the darkness , could now hear the lazy rumble of a river . As the hill became steeper , the trail became stairs , which climbed among the low vooden buildings of the Buddhist monastery surrounding the dagobas . All was darkness and silence . " May I be of assistance ? " a voice said . Behind me . Again . This time I did n't even bother to turn around . I just stopped ind let him walk around in front of me . He was a tiny , bald , ancient monk in a saffron robe . He smiled at me , shyly and toothessly , and bowed , or rather bobbed up and down repeatedly , like some sort of foraging bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . Why not ? " I 'm looking for a four-root-high black demon covered with diamonds . Seen any lately ? " He tried to appear sad , but his eyes glowed joyfully . The result ooked like mockery . " You are too late . " Damn , damn , damn . Always too late . " Where has he gone ? " " Nirvana ! " he said , and stood up straight . He was not much taller than Kinbarn . " His soul has left the Wheel . Follow me , you will see . " I walked behind him , slowing my pace to his tiny shuffling steps . We walked past several of the dagobas and into a hut perched precariously on a cliffside . Inside , it was pitch-black . I heard a faint summing sound . My guide struck a flint and lit several lamps inside the hut . It grew bright enough to see . Kinbarn sat in the middle of the room , in full lotus position . : Es three eyes stared off into nothingness . The faint hum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked up and vouched him . He did not react . An empty bowl sat next to his left knee . " We feed the body , " the monk said . " Rice . " I thought about shouting , " Come with me , pal , you 're under arrest ! " It did n't seem quite appropriate . I stood and watched him or a long time , letting that hum penetrate , until I could n't stand t any longer . It felt like something I 'd been hearing all my life , but lever noticed . The basic sound of the universe , maybe . The echoes nside my own skull . I did n't know . All I knew was that hearing it , Jut loud like that , was going to drive me crazy . I thanked the monk or his trouble , and left . He smiled after me . He did have one tooth , saw in the lamplight , at the right , way in back .  | So much for Kinbarn . The basic problem with using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good he might be , is that sooner or later , being so near the stuff all the time , he 'll overdose . I pushed my way into the jungle around the monastery toward a wormhole , trying not to think about panthers and snakes . It was time to return to the rendezvous point . Marienbad was waiting . He lay on the bottom of a large swimming pool behind an elaborate Moorish mansion in Beverly Hills , 1923 . It was midmorning . The house seemed to be deserted , though I could hear the hiss of sprinklers and the low conversation of Mexican gardeners somewhere behind the hedges . I sat down in one of the chairs by the side of the pool . " I want a daiquiri , " I said . Marienbad chuckled . " It is the houseboy 's day off , I fear . He is assisting at a party at Cecil B. deMille 's house . They are celebrating the release of his film The Ten Commandments . It is good to see you again , Mathias . Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both barrels . The Bishop , Solomon , R. E. Mann , Korans in New Kingdom Egypt , golden calves , Nirvana . " Astounding ! " he said . " I must say , I had half suspected such an operation . " " Why did n't you warn me about it then ? You could have saved me a lot of grief . " " Mathias ! And prejudice you ? That would not have been professional . But you have done an excellent job , nonetheless . Leaving the well-larded Mr. Mann to be repasted by hungry Aztec religionists was a stroke of genius . I applaud you . But , as you may have concluded , our job is not yet finished . We have uncovered a smuggling operation , incredible for its great size and its lack of scruples . Religious faith ! Parents spend their family 's monies on sacrifices and ritual vessels , children become intoxicated with dogma and doctrine . The social fabric of life is rent apart . A young lad begins with a few of Loyola 's Spiritual Exercises in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a cross on his back and is converting the heathen to support his own vile habit . We must put a stop to this ! " His voice quivered with outrage . I had been afraid of that . " When do I get a vacation ? " " After all this fun , you wish a vacation ? Oh , very well , Mathias . I know you are difficult . One week . Go to Elizabethan London . Take in a few plays , drink some sack , roister . That was a good time for roistering . But remember , when you return , you have your work cut out for you . The villain Mann has been masticated and digested . Rylieh , and justice , have yet to be served ! "  | THE SNOWSHOE HARE 'S half-eaten carcass lay under the deadfall of the figure-four trap , frozen blood crystallized on its fur , mouth still closed around the tiny piece of desiccated carrot that had served as bait . The snow was flattened around it , the rabbit 's fur thrown everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and growled . Canine bona fides reaffirmed , it settled on its haunches and looked expectantly up at the man . Part Samoyed , part husky , Jack 's thick white fur concealed a body thin from hunger . Elam did n't have to sniff . The stink of wolverine was malevolent in the still air . It turned the saliva that had come into his mouth at the thought of roasted hare into something spoiled . He spat . " Damn ! " The trap could n't be descented . He 'd have to make another . No animal would come anywhere near a trap that smelled like that . The wolverine probably had n't even been hungry . He pulled the dry carrot from the rabbit 's mouth and flung the remains off among the trees . The deadfall and the sticks of the figure four followed it , vanishing in puffs of snow . " That 's the last one , Jack , " Elam said . " Nothing , again . " The dog whined . They set off among the dark smooth trunks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freshly fallen snow . The dog turned its head , disturbed by the unprofessional noise , then loped off to investigate the upturned roots of a fallen tree . A breeze from the great lake to the north pushed its way through the trees , shouldering clumps of snow from the branches as it passed . A cardinal flashed from bough to bough , bright against the clearing evening sky . Elam , a slender , graceful man , walked with his narrow shoulders hunched up , annoyed by the chilly bombardment from above . His  | clothing was entirely of furry animal pelts sewn crudely together . His thick hat was muskrat , his jacket fox and beaver , his mittens rabbit , his pants elk . At night he slept in a sack made of a grizzly 's hide . How had he come to be here ? Had he killed those animals , skinned them , cured their hides ? He did n't know . At night , sometimes , before he went to sleep , Elam would lie in his lean-to and , by the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands through the fur , seeking memories in their thick softness . The various pelts were stitched neatly together . Had he done the sewing ? Or had a wife or a sister ? The thought gave him a curious feeling in the pit of his stomach . He rather suspected that he had always been alone . Weariness would claim him quickly , and he would huddle down in the warmth of the bear fur and fall asleep , questions unanswered . Tree roots examined , Jack London returned to lead the way up the ridge . It was a daily ritual , practiced just at sunset , and the dog knew it well . The tumbled glacial rocks were now hidden under snow , making the footing uncertain . Elam carried his snowshoes under one arm as he climbed . The height of the ridge topped the bare trees . To the north , glowing a deceptively warm red , was the snow-covered expanse of the great lake , where Elam often saw the dark forms of wolves , running and reveling in their temporary triumph over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year . Elam had no idea what body of water it was . He had tentatively decided on Lake Superior , though it could have been Lake Winnipeg , or for that matter , Lake Baikal . Elam sat down on a rock and stared at the deep north , where stars already gleamed in the sky . Perhaps he had it all wrong , and a new Ice Age was here , and this was a frozen Victoria Nyanza . " Who am I , Jack ? Do you know ? " The dog regarded him quizzically , used to the question by now . The man who 's supposed to get us some food , the look said . Philosophical discussions later . " Did I come here myself , Jack , or was I put here ? " Weary of the pointless and one-sided catechism , the dog was barking at a jay that had ventured too close . It circled for a moment , squawked , and shot off back into the forest . The lake wind freshened and grew colder , driving the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks tightened . " Let 's go , Jack . " He pulled off a mitten and plunged his hand into a pocket , feeling his last chunk of pemmican , greasy and hard . Aside from a few pathetically withered bits of carrot , which he  | needed to bait his traps , this was the last bit of food left him . He 'd been saving it for an emergency . Every trap on the trapline that ran through these woods had been empty or befouled by wolverines , even in a hard winter that should have driven animals to eat anything . He would eat the pemmican that night . Man and dog started their descent down the twilit reach of the ridge 's other side . As they reached the base , Elam , his hand once again feeling the pemmican , afraid that it too would vanish before he could eat it , took too long a step and felt his right foot slide on the icy face of a tilted rock . His left foot caught in the narrow crack of an ice-shattered boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world flung itself forward at him . He felt the dull snap in his leg as the icy rock met his face . He awoke to the warm licks of Jack London 's tongue turning instantly cold on his face . He lay tumbled on his back among the rocks , head tilting downward , trees looming overhead . Annoyed , he pushed back and tried to stand . Searing agony in his leg brought bile to the back of his throat and a hot sweat over his body . He moaned and almost lost consciousness again , then held himself up on his elbows . His face was cut , some of his teeth were cracked , he could taste the blood in his mouth , but his leg , his leg . . . he looked down . His left leg bent at an unnatural angle just below the knee . The leather of his trousers was soaked black with blood . Compound fracture of the . . . tibia ? Fibula ? For one distracted instant naming the shattered bone was the most important thing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . He shifted position and moaned again . The biting pain in his leg grew sharp burning teeth whenever he moved , but wore the edges off if he lay still , subsiding to a gnaw . With a sudden effort , he pulled the leg straight , then fell back , gasping harshly . It made no difference , of course , but seeing the leg at that angle made him uncomfortable . It looked better this way , not nearly so painful . He patted the dog on the head . " Sorry , Jack . I screwed up . " The dog whined in agreement . Elam fell back and let the darkness take him . His body did not give up so easily . He regained consciousness sometime later , the frenzied whining and yelping of his dog sounding in his ears . He lay prone in the snow , his hands dug in ahead of him . His mittens were torn , and he could not feel his hands . He rolled onto his back and looked over his feet . Full night had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the trail his body had left through the snow . Elam sighed . What a waste  | of time . The pain in his broken leg was almost gone , as was all other feeling from the thighs down . He spat . The spittle crackled on the snow . Damn cold . And the dog was annoying him with its whining . " Sure , boy , sure , " he said , gasping from the cold weight of death on his chest . " Just a minute , Jack . Just a minute . " He pulled what was left of the fur glove off with his chin and reached the unfeeling claw of his hand into his pocket . It took a dozen tries before it emerged holding the pemmican . He finally managed to open the front of his jacket and unlace his shirt . Cold air licked in eagerly . He smeared the greasy , hard pemmican over his chest and throat like a healing salve . Its rancid odor bit at his nose , and despite himself , he felt a moment of hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his shirt . " Here , Jack , " he said . " Here . Dinner . " The moon rode overhead , half in sunlight , the other half covered with glittering lines and spots . The dog snuffled , suddenly frightened and suspicious . Elam reached up and patted it on the head . Jack London moved forward . Smelling the meat , the dog overcame its caution at its master 's strange behavior and it began to lick eagerly at Elam 's throat and chest . The dog was desperately hungry . In its eagerness , a sharp tooth cut the man 's skin , and thick warm blood welled out . The tongue licked more quickly . More cuts . More blood , steaming aromatically in the cold air . And the dog was hungry . The smell penetrated to the deepest parts of its brain , finally destroying the overlay of training , habit , and love . The dog 's teeth tore and it began to feed . And in that instant , Elam remembered . He saw the warm forests of his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had become his own . Justice had at last been done . Elam was going to die . He smiled slightly , gasped once , then his eyes glazed blank . When it was sated , and realized what it had done , the dog howled its pain at the stars . It then sprang into the forest and ran madly , leaving the man 's tattered remains far behind . " Is that all you are going to do from now on ? " Reqata said . " Commit suicide ? Just lie down and die ? Nice touch , I admit , the dog . " She held his shoulder in a tight grip and looked past him with her phosphorescent eyes . " A real Elam touch . " Five dark ribs supported the smooth yellow stone of the dome . They revealed the green gleam of beetle carapaces in the light of the flames hanging in a hexagon around the central axis of the view chamber . Rows of striated marble seats climbed the chamber in p 115 concentric circles . The inhabitants of these seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet . Elam was himself startled at his clone 's acquiescence in its own death , but he was surrounded by admirers before he could answer her . They moved past him , murmuring , gaining haut by their admiration for the subtlety of his work . Elam stared past them at his own corpse , a sheen of frost already obscuring the face , turning it into an abstract composition . He had died well . He always did . His mind , back from the clone with its memories restored , seemed to rattle loosely around his skull . His skin was slick with amniotic fluid , his joints gritty . Nothing fit together . Reqata 's hand on his shoulder seemed to bend the arbitrarily shaped bones , reminding him of his accidental quality . " An artist who works with himself as both raw materials and subject can never transcend either , " Reqata said . Her scorn cut through the admiration around him . He looked up at her , and she smiled back with ebony teeth , flicking feathery eyelashes . She raised one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever body she was in . " And how does the choreographer of mass death transcend her material ? " Elam 's mind had been gone for weeks , dying in a frozen forest , and Reqata had grown bored in his absence . She needed entertainment . Even lovers constantly dueled with haut , the indefinable quality that all players at the Floating Game understood implicitly . Reqata had much haut . Elam had more . He squirmed . Was his bladder full , or did he always feel this way ? " Mass death , as you put it , is limited by practical problems , " Reqata answered . " Killing one man is an existential act . Killing a million would be a historic act , at least to the Bound . Killing them all would be a divine act . " She ran her fingers through his hair . He smelled the winy crispness of her breath . " Killing yourself merely smacks of lack of initiative . I 'm disappointed in you , Elam . You used to fight before you died . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desperate struggles of his early works , the ones that had gained him his haut . Men dying in mine shafts , on cliffsides , in predator-infested jungles . Men who had never stopped fighting . Each of those men had been himself . Something had changed . " Tell me something , " Reqata said , leaning forward . Her tongue darted across his earlobe . " Why do you always look so peaceful just before you die ? " A chill spread up his spine . He 'd wondered the same thing himself . " Do I ? " He squeezed the words out . He always paid . Five  | or ten minutes of memory , the final instants of life . The last thing he remembered from this particular work was pulling the pemmican from his pocket . After that , blackness . The dying clone Elam understood something the resurrected real Elam did not . " Certainly . Do n't be coy . Look at the grin on that corpse 's frozen face . " She slid into the seat next to him , draping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried dying . Not as art , just as experience . I die screaming . My screams echo for weeks . " She shuddered , hands pressed over her ears . Her current body , as usual , had a high rib cage and small firm breasts . Elam found himself staring at them . " But enough . " Reqata flicked him with a fingernail , scratching his arm . " Now that you 're done , I have a project for you to work on ? " " Perhaps each of you just gets a view of what awaits on the other side , " a voice drawled . " Do n't lecture me on the absolute inertia of the soul , " Reqata said , disconcerted . " No one 's giving our clones a free peek at eternity , Lammiela . " " Perhaps not . " A long elegant woman , Lammiela always looked the same , to everyone 's distress , for she only had one body . She smiled slowly . " Or perhaps heaven is already so filled with the souls of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you finally arrive . " Reqata stood up , fury in the rise of her shoulders . Because of her past irregularities , Lammiela had an ambiguous status , and Reqata hated risking haut in arguing with her . Usually , Reqata could n't help herself . " Be careful , Lammiela . You do n't know anything about it . " And perhaps , Elam found himself thinking , perhaps Reqata feared Death indeed . " Oh , true enough . " Lammiela sat . " Ssarna 's passing has everyone on edge . I keep forgetting . " Her arrival had driven the last of the connoisseurs away , and the three of them sat alone in the viewing chamber . " You do n't forget , Mother , " Elam said wearily . " You do it quite on purpose . " " That 's unfair , Elam . " She examined him . " You look well . Dying agrees with you . " She intertwined her long fingers and rested her chin on them . Her face was subtly lined , as if shaded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as Elam 's own . " Ssarna , they say , was withered in her adytum , dry as dust . The last time I saw her , which must have been at that party on top of that miserable mountain in the Himalayas , she was a tiny slip of a girl , prepubescent . Long golden . . . tresses . That must be the correct word . " She shook her head with weary contempt . " Though she p 117 disguised herself as young , old age found her in her most private chamber . And after old age had had his way with her , he gave her to Death . They have an arrangement . " " And the first of them is enjoying you now , " Reqata said . " How soon before the exchange comes ? " Lammiela 's head jerked , but she did not turn . " How have you been , Elam ? " She smiled at him , and he was suddenly surrounded by the smell of her perfume , as if it were a trained animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smell was dark and spicy . It reminded him of the smell of carrion , of something dead in the hot sun , thick and insistent . He found himself holding his breath , and stood up quickly , suddenly nauseated . Nauseated , yet somehow excited . A child 's feeling , the attraction of the vile , the need to touch and smell that which disgusts . Children will put anything in their mouths . He felt as if maggots were crawling under his fingernails . " Air , " Elam muttered . " I need . . . . " He walked up the striated marble stairs to the balcony above . Locked in their own conflict , the women did not follow . The warm summer air outside smelled of herbs and the dry flowers of chaparral . He clamped his teeth together and convinced himself that the flowers did not mask the smell of rotting flesh . Sunset turned the day lavender . The view chamber 's balcony hung high above the city , which flowed purposefully up the narrow valleys , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spiky crystal plants that had evolved under some distant sun . The Mediterranean glinted far below . Lights had come on in the city , illuminating its secret doorways . No one lived here . The Incarnate had other fashions , and the Bound were afraid of the ancient living cities , preferring to build their own . A Bound city could be seen burning closer to the water , its towers asserting themselves against the darkening sky . Tonight , many of the Incarnate who had witnessed Elam 's performance would descend upon it for the evanescent excitements of those who lived out their lives bound to one body . So this place was silent , save for the low resonance of bells , marking the hours for its absent dwellers . The city had been deserted for thousands of years , but was ready for someone to return . The insectlike shapes of aircars fluttered up against the stars as Elam 's audience went their separate ways . A coppery half-moon hung on the horizon , the invisible half of its face etched with colored lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lammiela had told him that the moon was  | inhabited by huge machines from some previous cycle of existence . The whole circle of a new moon crawled with light , an accepted feature . No one wondered at the thoughts of those intelligent machines , who looked up at the ripe blue-green planet that hung in their black sky . " You should lie down , " Lammiela said , " and rest . " Her perfume was cloying and spicy . Though it did not smell even remotely of carrion , Elam still backed away , pushing himself against the railing , and let the evening breeze carry the scent from him . Starlings swooped around the tower . " You should get up , " Reqata said , from somewhere behind her , " and run . " A blast of freezing air made him shiver . He took a step and looked down at the now hoarfrost-covered corpse in the deserted rotunda . No Incarnate alive knew how the ancient machines worked . The corpse : was it just an image of the one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved its spectators to hover over that forest in fact ? Or was this body a perfect duplicate , here in the hills of Provence , of that other one ? The knowledge was lost . No one knew what lay within the sphere of image . But Elam did know one thing : the cold winds of winter did not blow out of it . Elam spotted the zeppelins about two and a half hours out of Kalgoorlie . Their colors were gaudy against the green fields and the blue Nullarbor Sea . Frost glittered on the sides away from the morning sun . Elam felt a physical joy , for the zeppelins had been caught completely by surprise . They drifted in the heavy morning air , big fat targets . They were shuttling troops from somewhere to the North , in central Australia , to participate in one of those incomprehensible wars the Bound indulged in . Reqata had involved herself , in her capricious way , and staked haut on the outcome of the invasion of Eyre , the southern state . Elam could see the crewmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun like butterflies emerging from their chrysalis , but it was too late . Their zeppelins were doomed . Elam picked his target , communicating his choice to the other bumblebees , a few Incarnate who , amused at his constant struggle with Reqata , had joined him for the fun . The microwave signal felt like a directed whisper , save for the fact that it made his earlobes itch . He aimed for a bright green deltoid with markings that made it look like a giant spotted frog . For an instant the image took a p 119 hold of his mind , and he imagined catching a frog , grabbing it , and feeling its frightened wetness in his hand , the frantic beating of its heart ... . He pushed the thought away , upset at his loss of control . Timing was critical . A change in the angle of his wing stroke brought him back into position . Elam was gorgeous . About a meter long , he had short iridescent wings . A single long-distance optic tracked the target while two bulbous 270-degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Reqata was undoubtedly aboard one of the zeppelins , raging at the unexpected attack . The defending flyers were wide-faced black men , some odd purebred strain . Elam imagined the black Reqata , gesturing sharply as she arranged a defense . It was the quality of her movement that made her beautiful . A steel ball whizzed past his left wing . A moment later he heard the faint tock ! of the zeppelin 's catapult . It took only one hit to turn a bumblebee into a stack of expensive kindling . Elam tucked one wing , tumbled , and straightened out again , coming in at his target . He unhooked his fighting legs and brought their razor edges forward . The zeppelins were billowing , changing shape . Sudden flares disturbed Elam 's infrared sensors , making him dizzy , unsure of his target . Flying the bumblebees all the way out of Kalgoorlie without any lighter-than-air support craft had been a risk . They had to knock the zeppelins to the ground and parasitize them for reactive metals . The bumblebees would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreckage , but no one gained haut without taking chances . He dodged past the defending flyers , not bothering to cut them . That would only delay him . The green frog was now below him , swelling , rippling , dropping altitude desperately . He held it in his hand where he had caught it , amid the thick rushes . The other kids were gone , somewhere , and he was alone . The frog kicked and struggled . It had voided its bowels in his hand , and he felt the wet slime . The air was hot and thick underneath the cottonwoods . Something about the frog 's frantic struggle for life annoyed him . It seemed odious that something so wet and slimy would wish to remain alive . He laid the frog down on a flat rock and , with calm deliberation , brought another rock down on its head . Its legs kicked and kicked . The other zeppelins seemed to have vanished . All that remained was the frog , its guts lying out in the hot sun , putrefying as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He wanted to  | slash it apart with fire , to feel the flare as it gave up its life . The sun seared down on his shoulders . With a sudden fury , the zeppelin turned on him . He found himself staring into its looming mouth . A hail of steel balls flew past him , and he maneuvered desperately to avoid them . He did n't understand why he had come so close without attacking . Two balls ripped simultaneously through his right wing , sending flaring pain through the joints . He twisted down , hauling in on the almost nonfunctional muscles . If he pulled the wing in to a stable tip , he could glide downward . Green fields spiraled up at him , black houses with high-peaked roofs , colorful gardens . Pale faces peered up at him from the fields . Military vehicles had pulled up on a sandy road , the dark muzzles of their guns tracking him . The right wing was flopping loose , sending waves of pain through his body . He veered wildly , land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cutting leg and sliced off the loose part of his wing . Hot pain slashed through him . He had finally managed to stabilize his descent , but it was too late . A field of corn floated up to meet him . For an instant , everything was agony . " I want something primitive , " Elam said , as the doctor slid a testing limb into the base of his spine . " Something prehistoric . " " All of the human past is prehistoric , " Dr. Abias said . He withdrew the limb with a cold tickle , and retracted it into his body . " Your body is healthy . " Elam stood up , swinging his arms , getting used to his new proportions . His current body was lithe , gold-skinned , small-handed : designed to Reqata 's specifications . She had some need of him in this form , and Elam found himself apprehensive . He had no idea if she was still angry about her defeat over Australia . " No , Abias . I mean before any history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neanderthal ? " Abias murmured , hunching across the floor on his many legs . " Pithecanthropus ? Australopithecus ? " " I do n't know what any of those words mean , " Elam said . Sometimes his servant 's knowledge bothered him . What right did the Bound have to know so much when the Incarnate could dispose of their destinies so thoroughly ? Abias turned to look back at him with his multiple oculars , brown human eyes with no face , pupils dilated . He was a machine , articulated and segmented , gleaming as if anointed with rare oils . Each of his eight moving limbs was both an arm and a leg , as if  | his body had been designed to work in orbit . Perhaps it had . As he had pointed out , most of the past was prehistory . " It does n't matter , " Abias said . " I will look into it . " A Bound , Abias had been assigned to Elam by Lammiela . Punished savagely for a crime against the Incarnate , his body had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ran Elam 's team of cloned bodies . He was considered one of the best trainers in the Floating Game . He was so good and his loyalty so absolute that Elam had steadfastly refused to discover what crime he had committed , fearing that the knowledge would interfere in their professional relationship . " Do that , " Elam said . " I have a new project in mind . " He walked across the wide , open room , feeling the sliding of unfamiliar joints . This body , a clone of his own , had been extensively modified by Abias , until there were only traces of his own nature in it . A plinth was laid with earrings , wrist and ankle bracelets , body paints , scent bottles , all supplied by Reqata . He began to put them on . Light shone from overhead through semicircular openings in the vault . A rough-surfaced ovoid curved up through the floor in the room 's center . It was Elam 's adytum , the most secret chamber where his birth body lay . After his crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , with a feeling of agony , as if every part of his body were burning . The thought still made him shudder . An Incarnate 's adytum was his most strongly guarded space , for when his real body died , he died as well . There could be no transfer of consciousness to a cloned body once the original was dead . The ancient insolent machines that provided the ability to transfer the mind did not permit it , and since no one understood the machines , no one could do anything about it . And killing an Incarnate 's birth body was the only way to truly commit murder . Elam slid on a bracelet . " Do you know who attacked me ? " " No one has claimed responsibility , " Abias answered . " Did you recognize anything of the movement ? " Elam thought about the billowing froglike zeppelin . It had n't been Reqata , he was sure of that . She would have made certain that he knew . But it could have been almost anyone else . " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embarrassed at bringing up such a private function , even to his servant . " I woke up in my adytum . " Abias stood still , unreadable . " A terrible malfunction . I will look into it . " " Just make sure it does n't happen again . "  | The party was in the hills above the city of El'lie . Water from the northern rivers poured here from holes in the rock and swirled through an elaborate maze of waterways . It finally reached one last great pool , which extended terrifyingly off the rocky slope , as if ready to tip and spill , drowning the city below it . The white rock of the pool 's edge extended downward some thousands of feet , a polished sheet like the edge of the world . Far below , cataracts spilled from the pool 's bottom toward the thirsty city . Elam stood on a terrace and gazed down into the water . Reqata floated there , glistening as the afternoon sun sank over the ocean to the west . She was a strange creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , based on some creature humans had once encountered in their forgotten travels across the galaxy . She sweated color into the water , heavy swirls of bright orange and yellow sinking into the depths . Until a few hours before she had been wearing a slender gold-skinned body like Elam 's . " They seem peaceful , " she whispered , her voice echoing across the water . " But the potential for violence is extreme . " Reqata had hauled him on a preliminary tour of El'lie , site of her next artwork . He remembered the fresh bodies hung in tangles of chain on a granite wall , a list of their crimes pasted on their chests ; the tense market , men and women with shaved foreheads and jewels in their eyebrows , the air thick with spices ; the lazy insolence of a gang of men , their faces tattooed with angry swirls , as they pushed through the market crowd on their way to a proscribed patriarchal religious service ; the great tiled temples of the Goddesses that lined the market square . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not before the fall , when the S'tana winds blow down from the mountains . You 'll really see something then . " Hydraulic spines erected and sank down on her back , and she made them make a characteristic gesture , sharp and emphatic . If she was angry about what had happened in Australia , she concealed it . That frightened Elam more than open anger would have . Reqata had a habit of delayed reaction . Reqata was an expert at exploiting obscure hostilities among the Bound , producing dramatically violent conflicts with blood spilling picturesquely down carved staircases ; heads piled up in heaps , engraved ivory spheres thrust into their mouths ; lines of severed hands on bronze poles , fingers pointing toward Heaven . That was her art . She had wanted advice . Elam had not been helpful . Glowing lights floated above the pool , swirling in response to incomprehensible tropisms . No one knew how to control them any- p 123 more , and they moved by their own rules . A group of partyers stood on the far side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . " This water 's thousands of feet deep , " Reqata murmured . " The bottom 's piled up with forgotten things . Boats . Gold cups . The people from the city come up here and drop things in for luck . " " Why should dropping things and forgetting about them be lucky ? " Elam asked . " I do n't know . It 's not always lucky to remember everything . " Elam stripped off his gown and dove into the dark water . Reqata made a bubbling sound of delight . He stroked the spines on her back , feeling them swell and deflate . He ran a cupped hand up her side . Her glowing solar sweat worked its way between his fingers and dripped down , desperate to reach its natural place somewhere in the invisible depths . " Put on a body like this , " she said . " We can swim the deep oceans and make love there , among the fish . " " Yes , " he said , not meaning it . " We can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened on the balcony after we saw you die in the forest ? You seemed terrified . " Elam thought , instead , of the frog . Had his memories been real ? Or could Reqata have laid a trap for him ? " Just a moment of nausea . Nothing . " Reqata was silent for a moment . " She hates you , you know . Lammiela . She utterly hates you . " Her tone was vicious . Here it was , vengeance for the trick he had pulled over the Nullarbor Sea . Her body shuddered , and he was suddenly conscious of how much larger than he she now was . She could squish him against the side of the pool without any difficulty . He would awake in his own chamber , in another body . Killing him was just insulting , not fatal . Perhaps it had been her in that frog zeppelin . He swam slowly away from her . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Of course you do n't . You 're an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgetting . She hates you for what you did . For what you did to your sister ! " Her voice was triumphant . Elam felt the same searing pain he had felt when he awoke for one choking instant in his adytum . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " he said , as he pulled himself out of the water . " I know ! That 's just the problem . " " Tell me what you mean . " He kept his voice calm . Something moved heavily in the darkness , and a row of chairs  | overturned with a clatter . Elam turned away from the pool . His heart pounded . A burst of laughter sounded from across the pool . The party was continuing , but the guests were impossibly far away , like a memory of childhood , unreachable and useless . A head rose up out of the darkness , a head twice the size of Elam 's body . It was a metal egg , dominated by two expressionless eyes . Behind dragged a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasoning and senseless terror . The creature moved forward , swaying its head from side to side . Acid saliva drooled from beneath its crystal teeth , splashing and fizzing on the marble terrace . It was incomprehensibly ancient , something from the long-forgotten past . It swept its tail around and dragged Elam toward it . For an instant , Elam was paralyzed , staring at the strange beauty of the dragon 's teeth as they moved toward him . Then he struggled against the iron coil of the tail . His body still had traces of oil , and he slid out , stripping skin . He dove between the dragon 's legs , bruising his bones on the terrace . The dragon whipped around quickly , cornering him . With a belch , it sprayed acid over him . It burned down his shoulder , bubbling as it dissolved his skin . " Damn you ! " he shouted , and threw himself at the dragon 's head . It did n't pull back quickly enough , and he plunged his fist into its left eye . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon tossed its head , flinging Elam across the ground . He pulled himself to his feet , feeling the pain of shattered ribs . Blood dribbled down his chin . One of his legs would not support his weight . The massive head lowered down over him , muck pouring out of the destroyed eye . Elam grabbed for the other eye , but he had no strength left . Foul-smelling acid flowed over him , sloughing his flesh off with the sound of frying bacon . He stayed on his feet , trying to push imprecations between his destroyed lips . The last thing he saw was the crystal teeth , lowering toward his head . Lammiela 's house was the abode of infinity . The endless rooms were packed with the junk of a hundred worlds . The information here was irreplaceable , unduplicated anywhere else . No one came to visit , and the artifacts , data cubes , and dioramas rested in silence . At some time in the past millennia , human beings had explored as far inward as the galactic core and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured undersea creature , giving up its light to intergalactic space . They had moved through globular clusters of ancient suns and explored areas of stellar synthesis . They  | had raised monuments on distant planets . After some centuries of this , they had returned to Earth , built their mysterious cities on , i planet that must have been nothing but old legend , and settled down , content to till the aged soil and watch the sun rise and set . And , with magnificent insouciance , they had forgotten everything , leaving their descendants ignorant . Lammiela sat in the corner watching Elam . Her body , though elegant , was somehow bent , as if she had been cut from an oddly shaped piece of wood by a clever wood-carver utilizing the limita-t ions of his material . That was true enough , Elam reflected , examining the person who was both his parents . When young , Lammiela had found a ship somewhere on Earth 's moon , tended by the secret mechanisms that made their lives there , and gone forth to explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but somehow her exploits had gained enough attention that she had obtained extraordinary privileges . " It 's curious , " she said . " Our friends the Bound have skills that we Incarnate do not even dream of , because the machines our ancestors left us have no interest in them . " She looked thoughtful for a moment . " It 's surprising , some of the things the Bound can do . " " Like make you both my father and my mother , " Elam said . Her face was shadowed . " Yes . There is that . " Lammiela had been born male , named Laurance . But Laurance had felt himself to be a woman . No problem for one of the Incarnate , who could be anything they wished . Laurance could have slept securely in his adytum and put female bodies on for his entire life . But Laurance did not think that way . He had gone to the Bound , and they had changed him to a woman . " When the job was finished , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fertilized my new ova . I do n't know if it was a natural consequence of the rituals they used . " Her muscles tightened with the memories . Tendons stood out on the backs of her hands . " They kept me conscious through it all . Pain is their price . They slew the male essence . I saw it , screaming before me . Laurance , burning . " It had cost most of her haut to do it . Dealings with the Bound inevitably involved loss of status . " I still see him sometimes , " she said . " Who ? " Elam asked . " Your father , Laurance . " Her eyes narrowed . " They did n't kill him well enough , you see . They told me they did , but he 's still around . " Her eyes darted , as if expecting to find Laurance hiding behind a diorama.  | Elam felt a chill , a sharp feeling at the back of his neck , as if someone with long , long nails were stroking him there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not someone else . " " Do you really know so much about identity , Elam ? " She sighed , relaxing . " You 're right , of course . Still , was it I who stood in the Colonnade at Hrlad ? " She pointed at a hologram of a long line of rock obelisks , the full galaxy rising beyond them . " I 'm not sure I remember it , not as if I had been there . It was legend , you know . A bedtime story . But Hrlad is real . So is Laurance . You look like him , you know . You have your father 's eyes . " She stared at him coldly , and he , for the first time , thought that Reqata might have spoken truly . Perhaps his mother did indeed hate him . " I made my choice , " she said . " I can never go back . The Bound wo n't let me . I am a woman , and a mother . " Lammiela did not live in the city where most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountainside , bleak and alone , the rigid curving walls of her house holding off the snow . She moved her dwelling periodically , from seashore to desert to mountain . She had no adytum , with its body , to lug with her . Elam , somehow , remembered deep forest when he was growing up , interspersed with sunny meadows . The vision was n't clear . Nothing was clear . After this most recent death , Elam had once again awakened in his adytum . He 'd felt the fluid flowing through his lungs , and the darkness pressing down on his open eyes . Fire had burned through his veins , but there was no air to scream with . Then he had awakened again , normally , on a pallet in the light . " Mother , " he said , looking off at a broad-spectrum hologram of Sirius that spilled vicious white light across the corner of the room , too bright to look at directly without filters . " Am I truly your only child ? " Lammiela 's face was still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence , and forgotten thereafter . I suppose there must be a time in the middle when they are known . Who told you ? " " Does it matter ? " " Yes . It was thrown at you as a weapon , was n't it ? " Elam sighed . " Yes . Reqata . " " Ah , yes . I should have guessed . Dear Reqata . Does she love you , Elam ? " The question took him aback . " She says she does . " " I 'm sure she means it then . I wonder what it is about you that she loves . Is that where the discussion ended then ? With the ques-tion ? " p 127 " Yes . We were interrupted . " Elam described the dragon 's attack . " Ah , how convenient . Reqata was always a master of timing . Who was it , do you suppose ? " She looked out of the circular window at the mountain tundra , the land falling away to a vast ice field , just the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains haut anonymously . " " No one recognized the style . Or if they did , they did not admit it . " The scene was wrong , Elam thought . It should have been trees : smooth-trunked beeches , heavy oaks . The sun had slanted through them as if the leaves themselves generated the light . " So why are you here , Elam ? Are you looking for the tank in which that creature was grown ? You may search for it if you like . Go ahead . " " No ! " Elam said . " I want to find my sister . " And he turned away and ran through the rooms of the house , past the endless vistas of stars that the rest of the human race had comfortably forgotten . Lammiela silently followed , effortlessly sliding through the complex displays , as Elam stumbled , now falling into an image of a kilometer-high cliff carved with human figures , now into a display of ceremonial masks with lolling tongues . He suddenly remembered running through these rooms , their spaces much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left no place to hide . In a domed room he stopped at a wall covered with racks of dark metal drawers . He pushed a spot and one slid open . Inside was a small animal , no bigger than a cat , dried as if left out in the sun . It was recognizably the dragon , curled around itself , its crystalline teeth just visible through its pulled-back lips . Lammiela looked down at it . " You two never got along . You would have thought that you would . . . but I guess that was a foolish assumption . You tormented her with that thing , that ... monster . It gave her screaming nightmares . Once , you propped it by her bed so that she would see it when she woke up . For three nights after that she did n't sleep . " She slid the drawer shut . " Who was she ? " Elam demanded , taking her shoulders . She met his gaze . " It 's no longer something that will just be forgotten . " She weakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fooled . His mother had dealt with dangers that could have killed her a dozen times over . He tightened his grip on her shoulders . " Your sister 's name was Orfea . Lovely name , do n't you think ? I think Laurance picked it out . " Elam could remember no sister . " Was she older or younger ? " " Neither . You were split from one ovum , identical twins . One was given an androgen bath and became you , Elam . The other was  | female : Orfea . God , how you grew to hate each other ! It frightened me . And you were both so talented . I still have some of her essence around , I think . " " I . . . what happened to her ? Where is she ? " " That was the one thing that consoled me , all these years . The fact that you did n't remember . I think that was what allowed you to survive . " " What ? Tell me ! " Lammiela took only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther . " She was murdered . She was just a young girl . So young . " Elam looked at her , afraid of the answer . He did n't remember what had happened , and he could still see hatred in his mother 's eyes . " Did they ever find out who did it ? " he asked softly . She seemed surprised by the question . " Oh , there was never any doubt . She was killed by a young friend of yours . He is now your servant . Abias . " " I have to say that it was in extremely poor taste , " Reqata said , not for the first time . " Death is a fine performance , but there 's no reason to perform it at a dinner party . Particularly in my presence . " She got up from the bed and stretched . This torso was wide , and well-muscled . Once again , the rib cage was high , the breasts small . Elam wondered if , in the secrecy of her adytum , Reqata was male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female body . " Just out of curiosity , " Elam said . " Could you tell who the dragon was ? " He ran his hand over the welts on his side , marks of Reqata 's fierce love . She glanced back at him , eyelids half lowered over wide violet eyes . She gauged if her answer would affect her haut . " Now that was a good trick , Elam . If I had n't been looking right at you , I would have guessed that it was you behind those glass fangs . " She walked emphatically across the room , the slap of her bare feet echoing from the walls , and stood , challengingly , on the curve of Elam 's adytum . Dawn had not yet come , and light was provided by hanging globes of a blue tint that Elam found unpleasant . He had never discovered a way to adjust or replace them . " Oh , Elam , " she said . " If you are working on something , I approve . How you fought ! You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing left of you but bones . That dragon crunched them like candy canes . " She shuddered , her face flushed . " It was wonderful . " Elam stretched and rolled out of the bed . As his weight left it , p 129 it rose off the floor , to vanish into the darkness overhead . The huge room had no other furniture . " What do you know about my sister ? " he asked . Reqata lounged back on the adytum , curling her legs . " I know she existed , I know she 's dead . More than you did , apparently . " She ran her hands up her sides , cupping her breasts . " You know , the first stories I heard of you do n't match you . You were more like me then . Death was your art , certainly , but it was n't your own death . " " As you say , " Elam said , stalking toward her , " I do n't remember . " " How could you have forgotten ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adytum . " This is where you are , Elam . If I ripped this open , I could kill you . Really kill you . Dead . " " Want to try it ? " He leaned over her . She rested back , lips parted , and dug her fingernails in a circle around his nipple . " It could be exciting . Then I could see who you really were . " He felt the sweet bite of her nails through his skin . If he had only one body , he reflected , perhaps he could never have made love to Reqata . He could n't have lasted . He pushed himself forward onto her , and they made love on his adytum , above his real body as it slumbered . Abias 's kingdom was brightly lit , to Elam 's surprise . He had expected a mysterious darkness . Hallways stretched in all directions , leading to chambers of silent machines and tanks filled with organs and bodies . As he stepped off the stairs , Elam realized that he had never before been down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a part of his house as any other . But this was Abias 's domain . This was where the magic was done . His bumblebee lay on a table , its dead nervous system scooped out . Dozens of tiny mechanisms crawled over it , straightening its spars , laying fragile wing material between the ribs . Elam pictured them crawling over his own body , straightening out his ribs , coring out his spinal column , resectioning his eyes . Elam touched a panel , and a prism rose up out of the floor . In it was himself , calmly asleep . Elam always kept several standard , unmodified versions of his own body ready . That was the form in which he usually died . Elam examined the face of his clone . He had never inhabited this one , and it looked strange in consequence . No emotions had ever played over those slack features , no lines of care had ever formed on the forehead or around the eyes . The face was an infant turned physically adult . The elaborate shape of Abias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , segmented legs gleaming . Elam felt a moment of fear . He imagined those limbs seizing his mysterious faceless sister , Orfea , rending her , their shine dulled with her blood , sizzling smoke rising . . . he fought the images down . Abias had been a man then , if he 'd been anything . He 'd lost his body as a consequence of that murder . Abias regarded him . As a Bound , and a cyborg to boot , Abias had no haut . He had no character to express , needed no gestures to show who he was . His faceless eyes were unreadable . Had he been trying to kill Elam ? He had the skills and resources to have created the zeppelin , grown the dragon . But why ? If he wanted to kill Elam , the real Elam , the adytum lay in his power . Those powerful limbs could rip the chamber open and drag the sleeping Elam out into the light . Elam 's consciousness , in a clone somewhere else , would n't know what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the new body ready ? " Elam said abruptly . Abias moved quietly away . After a moment 's hesitation , Elam followed , deeper into the lower levels . They passed a prism where a baby with golden skin slept , growing toward the day that Elam could inhabit it , and witness Reqata 's Ellie artwork . It would replace the body destroyed by the dragon . Lying on a pallet was a short heavy-boned body with a rounded jaw and beetle brows . " It was a matter of genetic regression , based on the markers in the cytoplasmic mitochondria , " Abias said , almost to himself . " The mitochondrial DNA is the timer , since it comes only from the female ancestor . The nucleic genetic material is completely scrambled . But much of it stretches back far enough . And of course we have stored orang and chimp genes as well . If you back and fill ? " " That 's enough , Abias , " Elam said impatiently . " It does n't mat-ter . " " No , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Neander-thal . " Elam looked down at the face that was his own , a few hundred thousand years back into the past . " How long have I known you , Abias ? " " Since we were children , " Abias said softly . " Do n't you remember ? " " You know I do n't remember . How could I have lived with you for so long otherwise ? You killed my sister . " " How do you know that ? " " Lammiela told me that you killed Orfea . " " Ah , " Abias said . " I did n't kill her , Elam . " He paused . " You do n't remember her . " p 131 " No . As far as I 'm concerned , I have always been alone . " " Perhaps you always have been . " Elam considered this . " Are you claiming that Reqata and my mother are lying ? That there never was an Orfea ? " Abias lowered all of his limbs until he was solid on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to kill you . These attempts are not accidents . " " I know . Perhaps you . " " That 's not even worth answering . " " But who would want to go around killing me repeatedly in my clones ? " " From the information we have now , " Abias said , " it could be anyone . It could even be Orfea . " " Orfea ? " Elam stared at him . " Did n't you just claim she never existed ? " " I did not . I said I did n't kill her . I did n't . Orfea did not die that day . " His eyes closed and he was immobile . " Only I did . " It was a land that was familiar , but as Elam stalked it in his new body , he did not know whether it was familiar to him , Elam , or to the Neanderthal he now was . It was covered with a dark forest , broken by clearings , crossed by clear icy streams scattered with rocks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His body was wrapped in fur . It was not fur from an animal he had killed himself , but something Abias had mysteriously generated , in the same way he had generated the fur Elam had worn when he died in the Michigan winter . For all he knew , it was some bizarre variant of his own scalp hair . Since this was just an exploratory journey , the creation of belowconscious reflexes , Elam retained his own memories . They sat oddly in his head . This brain perceived things more directly , seeing each beam of sunlight through the forest canopy as a separate entity , with its own characteristics and personality , owing little to the sun from which it ultimately came . A stream had cut a deep ravine , revealing ruins . The Neanderthal wandered among the walls , which stood knee-deep in the water , and peered thoughtfully at their bricks . He felt as if he were looking at the ruins of the incomprehensibly distant future , not the past at all . He imagined wading mammoths pushing their way through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the thought of a mammoth his hands itched to feel the haft of a spear , though lie could certainly not kill such a beast by himself . He needed the help of his fellows , and they did not exist . He walked the Earth ; clone .  | Something grunted in a pool that had once been a basement . He sloshed over to it , and gazed down at the frog . It sat on the remains of a windowsill , pulsing its throat . Elam reached down ... and thought of the dying frog , shuddering its life out in his hand . He tied it down , limbs outspread , and played the hot cutting beam over it . It screamed and begged as the smoke from its guts rose up into the clear sky . Elam jerked his hand back from the frog , which , startled , dove into the water and swam away . He turned and climbed the other side of the ravine . He was frightened by the savagery of the thought that had possessed him . When he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open rolling hills , the forest having retreated to the colder northern slopes . The past seemed closer here , as if he had indeed lived it . He had hated Orfea . The feeling came to him like the memory of a shaman 's rituals , fearsome and complex . It seemed that the hate had always been with him . That form , with his shape and gestures , loomed before him . The memories were fragmentary , more terrifying than reassuring , like sharp pieces of colored glass . He saw the face of a boy he knew to be Abias , dark-eyed , curly-haired , intent . He bent over an injured animal , one of Elam 's victims , his eyes shiny with tears . Young , he already possessed a good measure of that ancient knowledge the Bound remembered . In this case the animal was beyond healing . With a calmly dismissive gesture , Abias broke its neck . The leaves in the forest moved of their own will , whispering to each other of the coming of the breeze , which brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered Orfea , a slender girl with dark hair , but he never saw her clearly . Her image appeared only in reflections , side images , glimpses of an arm or a strand of hair . And he saw himself , a slender boy with dark hair , twin to Orfea . He watched himself as he tied a cat down to a piece of wood , spreading it out as it yowled . There was a fine downy hair on his back , and he could count the vertebrae as they moved under his smooth young skin . The arm sawed with its knife , and the cat screamed and spat . The children wandered the forest , investigating what they had found in the roots of a tree . It was some sort of vast lens , mostly under the ground , with only one of its faces coming out into the air . They brushed the twigs and leaves from it and peered in , wondering at its ancient functions . Elam saw Orfea 's face reflected in it , solemn eyes examining him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lens , awakening lights deep within it ,  | vague images of times and places now vanished . Midges darted in the sun , and Orfea 's skin produced a smooth and heavy odor , one of the perfumes she mixed for herself : her art , as death was Elam 's . F , lam looked down at her hand , splayed on the smooth glass , then across at his , already rougher , stronger , with the hints of dark dried blood around the fingernails . Abias stood above them . He danced on the smooth glass , his callused feet slipping . He laughed every time he almost fell . " Can you see us ? " he cried to the lens . " Can you see who we are ? Can you see who we will become ? " Elam looked up at him in wonder , then down at the boy 's tiny distorted reflection as it cavorted among the twisted trees . The sun was suddenly hot , slicing through the trees like a burning edge . Smoke rose as it sizzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope . He ran until his lungs were dying within him . The Neanderthal stopped in a clearing up the side of a mountain . A herd of clouds moved slowly across the sky , cropping the blue grass of the overhead . Around him rocks , the old bones of the I ' ; arth , came up through its sagging flesh . The trees whispered derisively below him . They talked of death and blood . " You should have died , " they said . " The other should have lived . " The Neander-t hal turned his tear-filled eyes into the wind , though whether he wept for Orfea , or for Elam , even he could not have said . The city burned with a dry thunder . Elam and Reqata ran through t he crowded screaming streets with the arsonists , silent and pure men . In the shifting firelight , their tattoed faces swirled and reformed , as if made of smoke themselves . " The situation has been balanced for years , " Reqata said . " Peace conceals strong forces pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Swords flashed in the firelight , a meaningless battle between looters and some sort of civil guard . Ahead were the tiled temples of the Goddesses , their goal . " They feel things we do n't , " she said . " Religious exaltation . The suicidal depression of failed honor . Fierce loyalty to a leader.Hysterical terror at signs and portents . " Women screamed from the upper windows of a burning building , holding their children out in vain hope of salvation . " Do you envy them ? " Elam asked . " Yes ! " she cried . " To them , life is not a game . " Her hand was t ight on his arm . " They know who they are . " " And we do n't ? "  | " Take me ! " Reqata said fiercely . Her fingernails stabbed through his thin shirt . They had made love in countless incarnations , and these golden-skinned slender bodies were just another to her , even with the flames rising around them . He took her down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . Her scent pooled dark . It was the smell of death and decay . He looked at her . Beneath him , eyes burning with malignant rage , was Orfea . " You are alive , " Elam cried . Her face glowered at him . " No , you bastard , " she said . " I 'm not alive . You are . You are . " His rage suddenly matched hers . He grabbed her hair and pulled her across the rough stone . " Yes . And I 'm going to stay that way . Understand ? Understand ? " With each question , he slammed her head on the stone . Her face was amused . " Really , Elam . I 'm dead , remember ? Dead and gone . What 's the use of slamming me around ? " " You were always like that . Always sensible . Always driving me crazy ! " He stopped , his hands around her throat . He looked down at her . " Why did we hate each other so much ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Lammiela who thought there were two . " Pain sliced across his cheek . Reqata slapped him again , making sure her nails bit in . Blood poured down her face and her hair was tangled . Elam stumbled back , and was shoved aside by a mob of running soldiers . " Are you crazy ? " she shouted . " You ca n't kill me . You ca n't . You 'll ruin everything . " She was hunched , he saw now , cradling her side . She reached down and unsheathed her sword . " Are you trying to go back to your old style ? Try it somewhere else . This is my show . " " Wait , " he said . " Damn you , we 'll discuss this later . In another life . " The sword darted at him . " Reqata ! " He danced back , but the edge caught him across the back of his hand . " What are you ? " There were tears in her eyes as she attacked him . " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . I see her at night , when you are asleep . Your face is different . It 's the face of a woman , Elam . A woman ! Did you know that ? Orfea lives on in you somewhere . " Her sword did not allow him to stop and think . She caught him again , cutting his ear . Blood soaked his shoulder . " Your perfume . Who sent it to you ? " p 135 " Do n't be an idiot . Something in you is Orfea , Elam . That 's the only part I really love . " He tripped over a fallen body . He rolled and tried to get to his feet . He found himself facing the point of her sword , still on his knees . " Please , Reqata , " he said , tears streaming down his cheeks . " I do n't want to die . " " Well , is n't that the cutest thing . " Her blade pushed into his chest , cold as ice . " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his adytum . His eyes generated dots of light to compensate for the complete darkness . His blood vessels burned as if filled with molten metal . He moved , pushing against the viscous fluid . Damp hair swirled around him , thick under his back , curling around his feet . It had gathered around his neck . There was no air to breathe . Elam . Where was Elam ? He seemed to be gone at last , leaving only Elam awoke , gasping , on a pallet , still feeling the metal of Re-qata 's sword in his chest . So it had been her . Not satisfied with killing everyone else , she had needed to kill him as well , repeatedly . lie , even now , could not understand why . Orfea . He stood silently in the middle of the room and listened to the beating of his own heart . Only it was n't his own , of course , not the one he had been born with . It was a heart that Abias had carefully grown in a tank somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the original Elam . The real Elam still slept peacefully in his adytum . Peacefully . . . he had almost remembered something this time . Things had almost become clear . He walked down to Abias 's bright kingdom . Abias had tools there , surgical devices with sharp , deadly edges . It was his art , was n't it ? And a true artist never depended on an audience to express himself . He searched through cabinets , tearing them open , littering the floor with sophisticated devices , hearing their delicate mechanisms shatter . He finally found a surgical tool with a vibratory blade that could cut through anything . He carried it upstairs and stared down at the ovoid of the adytum . What was inside of it ? If he penetrated , perhaps , at last , he could truly see . It was n't the right thing , of course . The right instrument had to burn as it cut , cauterizing flesh . He remembered its bright killing flare . This was but a poor substitute . Metal arms pinioned him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not do that yet . "  | " What do you mean ? " Elam pulled himself from Abias 's suddenly unresisting arms and turned to face him . The faceless eyes stared at him . " I mean that you do n't understand anything . You can not act without finally understanding . " " Tell me , then ! " Elam shouted . " Tell me what happened . I have to know . You say you did n't kill Orfea . Who did then ? Did I ? Did I do it ? " Abias was silent for a long time . " Yes . Your mother has , I think , tried to forgive you . But you are the murderer . " " You were not supposed to remember . " Lammiela sat rigidly in her most private room , her mental adytum . " The Bound told me you would not . That part of you was to vanish . Just as Laurance vanished from me . " " I have n't remembered . You have to help me . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes would have frightened him . Now it comforted him , for he must be near the truth . " You were a monster as a child , Elam . Evil , I would have said , though I loved you . You were Laurance , returned to punish me for having killed him .... " " I tortured animals , " Elam said , hurrying to avoid Lammiela 's past and get to his own . " I started with frogs . I moved up to cats , dogs .... " " And people , Elam . You finally moved to people . " " I know , " he said , thinking of the dead Orfea , whom he feared he would never remember . " Abias told me . " " Abias is very forgiving , " Lammiela said . " You lost him his body , and nearly his life . " " What did I do with him ? " She shook her head . " I do n't know , Elam . He has never said . All these years , and he has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but somehow you were still jealous of each other . She cared for Abias , your friend from the village , and that made you wild . He was so clever about that ancient Bound knowledge the Incarnate never pay attention to . He always tried to undo the evil that you did . He healed animals , putting them back together . Without you , he may never have learned all he did . He was a magi-cian . " " Mother ? " She glared at him . " You strapped him down , Elam . You wanted to . . . to castrate him . Cloning , you called it . You said you could p 137 clone him . He might have been able to clone you , I do n't know , but you certainly could do nothing but kill him . Orfea tried to stop you , and you fought . You killed her , Elam . You took that hot cutting knife and you cut her apart . It explodes flesh , if set right , you know . There was almost nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of remembered pleasure . " As you were murdering your sister , Abias freed himself . He struggled and got the tool away from you . " " But he did n't kill me . " " No . I never understood why . Instead , he mutilated you . Carefully , skillfully . He knew a lot about the human body . You were unrecognizable when they found you , all burned up , your genitals destroyed , your face a blank . " " And they punished Abias for Orfea 's murder . Why ? " " He insisted that he had done it . I knew he had n't . I finally made him tell me . The authorities did n't kill him , at my insistence . Instead , they took away his body and made him the machine he now is . " And you made him serve me , " Elam said in wonder . " All these years , you 've made him serve me . " She shook her head . " No , Elam . That was his own choice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has served you ever since . " Elam felt hollow , spent . " You should have killed me , " he whispered . " You should not have let me live . " Lammiela stared at him , her eyes bleak and cold . " I daresay you 're right , Elam . You were Laurance before me , the man I can never be again . I wanted to destroy you , totally . Expunge you from existence . But it was Abias 's wish that you live , and since he had suffered at your hands , I could n't gainsay him . " " Why then ? " Elam said . " Why do you want to kill me now ? " He stretched his hands out toward his mother . " If you want to , do it . I ) o it ! " " I do n't know what you are talking about , Elam . I have n't tried to kill you . I gave up thinking about that a long time ago . " He sagged . " Who then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go through all this trouble for one death ? It 's not her style , Elam . You 're not that important to her . Orfea was an artist too . Her art was scent . Scents that stick in your mind and call up past times when you smell them again . " " You wore one of them , " Elam said , in sudden realization . " The day my death in the north woods ended . " " Yes , " she said , her voice suddenly taut again . " Orfea wore that scent on the last day of her life , Elam . You probably remember it . "  | The scent brought terror with it . Elam remembered that . " Did you find some old vial of it ? Whatever made you wear it ? " She looked at him , surprised . " Why , Elam . You sent it to me yourself . " Abias stood before him like a technological idol , the adytum between them . " I 'm sorry , Abias , " Elam said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You gave yourself up to save me . " " Kill me , Abias , " he said , not paying attention to what the cyborg had lust said . " I understand everything now . I can truly die . " He held the vibratory surgical tool above the adytum , ready to cut in , to kill what lay within . " No , Elam . You do n't understand everything , because what I told Lammiela that day was not the truth . I lied , and she believed me , " He pushed , and a line appeared across the adytum 's ovoid . " What is the truth then , Abias ? " Elam waited , almost uninter-ested . " Orfea did not die that day , Elam . You did . " The adytum split slowly open . " You did try to kill me , Elam , " Abias said softly , almost reminisCently . " You strapped me down for your experiment . Orfea tried to stop you . She grabbed the hot cutting knife and fought with you . She killed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of an adytum was a dark secret . Elam peered inside , for a moment seeing nothing but yards and yards of wet dark hair . " Do n't you understand , Orfea ? Do n't you know who you are ? " Abias 's voice was anguished . " You killed Elam , whom you hated , but it was too much for you . You mutilated yourself , horribly . And you told me what you wanted to be . I loved you . I did it . " I wanted to be Elam , " Elam whispered . The face in the adytum was not his own . Torn and mutilated still , though repaired by Abias 's skill , it was the face of Orfea . The breasts of a woman pushed up through the curling hair . " You wanted to be the brother you had killed . After I did as you said , no one knew the difference . You were Elam . The genes were identical , since you were split from the same ovum . No one questioned what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to the Bound . And you 've been gone ever since . Your hatred for who you thought you were caused you to kill yourself , over and over . Elam was alive again , and knew that  | ( ) rfea had killed him . Why should he not hate her ? " " No , " Elam said . " I do n't hate her . " He slumped slowly to his knees , looking down at the sleeping face . " I had to bring her back , you understand that ? " Abias 's voice was anguished . " If only one of you can live , why should it be Elam ? Why should it be him ? Orfea 's spirit was awakening , slowly , after all these years . I could see it sometimes , in you . " " So you brought it forth , " Elam said . " You cloned and created creatures in which her soul could exist . The zeppelin . The dragon . " " Yes . " " And each time , she was stronger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a longer time in the adytum . " " Yes ! " Abias stood over him , each limb raised glittering above his head . " She will live . " Elam rested his fingers in her wet hair and stroked her cheek . She had slept a long time . Perhaps it was indeed time for him to attempt his final work of art , and die forever . Orfea would walk the Earth again . " No ! " Elam shouted . " I will live . " Abias loomed over him as the dragon had , ready to steal his life from him . He swung the vibrating blade and sliced off one of Abias 's limbs . Another swung down , knocking Elam to the floor . He rolled . Abias raised himself above . Elam stabbed upward with the blade . It penetrated the central cylinder of Abias 's body and was pulled from his hands as Abias jerked back . Elam lay defenseless and awaited the ripping death from Abias 's manipulator arms . But Abias stood above him , motionless , his limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Elam realized that he was never going to move again . The adytum had shut of its own accord , its gray surface once again featureless . Elam rested his forehead against it . After all these years he had learned the truth , the truth of his past and his own identity . Abias had made him seem an illegitimate soul , a construct of Orfea 's guilt . Perhaps that was indeed all he was . He shivered against the roughness of the adytum . Orfea slumbered within it . With sudden anger , he slapped its surface . She could continue to sleep . She had killed him once . She would not have the chance to do it again . Elam stood up wearily . He leaned on the elaborate sculpture of the dead Abias , feeling the limbs creak under his weight . What was Elam without him ? Elam was alive . He smiled . For the first time in his life , Elam was alive .  | I HAD GOTTEN LOST again , as I so often did , because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run between the universes . I 've always been impressed by the amount of crap that seems to float in through the doorways and settle there , in some sort of plea for reality . An infinite network of passages linking the worlds of Shadow with that of the real might seem like a good idea , but who was going to keep it clean ? The Lords were too haughty to concern themselves with things like that , and we humans were too . . . finite . I looked in through doorways as I walked , to see such things as a city of hanging tree dwellings or an endless stairway that curved up from mist into blinding sunlight . These were delicate worlds , miniatures . As a professional critic of such Shadows I had to say that these worlds were not the style I usually liked , though one , where a regatta of multicolored dirigibles sailed above a city whose towers stood half in the sea , was excellent . A rough wind blew past , carrying with it the clamor of a cheering army and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward , and I climbed a set of rough stairs , smelling first lilacs , then , when I took a deeper breath , an open sewer . I choked , and was surrounded by buzzing flies , which had wandered irrevocably from their world and , looking for shit , had found only the meager substitute of a critic . I ran up the stairs , waving the flies away , past the sound of temple bells , the dense choking of dust from a quarry , and a spray of briny water , accompanied by the shrieking of sea gulls . Gathered in a knot in the hallway ahead of me was a group of Lords , with their servant , a huge man wearing a leather helmet . Lord Prokhor , Lord Sere , and Lord Ammene , three balding men with prison pallor and rings below their dark eyes , waited for me  | to give them advice on acquisition . They sat on little folding stools and looked uncomfortable . " You are late , Mr. Landstatter , " Lord Ammene said , in a reedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ignoring the challenge . I eyed the three of them suspiciously . Lords were entirely unpredictable , and their motivations obscure . On my last trip I 'd almost been trapped when Cuzco , capital of the Incan Empire , fell to invading Apache Sacred Warriors who had hired Maori warships for transport from their temple cities along the Pacific coast of Mexico . I 'd spent three desperate days freezing in the Andes , my nights lit by the glow from the burning city reflected in the ice fields , before I could return home . I had wondered if it was an accident , because someone had locked me in my room just when the attack began . The three of them returned my bow without standing . The servant raised the lamp he held in his hand and examined me . I wore a three-cornered plumed hat , a heavy powder-blue tailcoat covered with useless gold buttons , a stiff embroidered vest with hunting scenes on it , extremely tight cream-colored silk trousers , and black leather boots trimmed with sable . Beneath the hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a ponytail by an ornate silver clasp . The servant sneered at me . The Lords were dressed in their usual sober dark clothes , gold chains around their necks indicating rank . Unlike most people , they did not adopt clothing from Shadow , implying , I guess , that what they always wore was " real . " Style is never real , but I am a critic of worlds , not dress , so I said nothing . Then the servant turned the lamp around . I straightened my hat . We stood in front of a stretch of blank wall . Humming gently to himself , he adjusted the lamp until it focused on the wall . The wall shimmered , and a door opened onto a brightly lit street . I could hear the ringing of steel wagon wheels on cobblestones and the puffing of a steam launch on the river that flowed just out of sight of the doorway . " There you are , Mr. Landstatter . See you in fortyeight hours . " I stopped just in front of the shimmering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . Vanishing into unreality makes me nervous . He pushed me through , not roughly , but the way you would direct a timid actor onto a stage in front of an audience . I turned to protest , but he and his masters were gone , and I found myself addressing my retort to a broken and stained brick wall . The water swirled against the brick side of the canal , as if irritated AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 145  | at having its freedom curtailed , but finally acquiesced and flowed tinder the arch of the bridge . On the river beyond , a vendor guiding his empty flatboat home from the market negotiated the uneven current with tired familiarity . Past the inflow of the canal he put his shoulders into his poling , undoubtedly thinking of a bowl of stew , a mug of beer , and a pipe of tobacco . I was starting to think of things like that too . I watched the boatman vanish into the iridescent meeting of sunset and oily water , then turned and began to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north and south branches of the Schekaagau River joined and flowed into Lake Vlekke . It was also where the best hotels were . I strayed into the path of a pedicab , and was startled by a jangle of bells that sounded like an angry gamelan . The white-suited driver bared polished scrimshawed teeth , cursed at me in Malay , and was gone , leaving only a cloud of ginger and curry to mark his passing . The tall step-gabled warehouses that had been flanking me on the left vanished , to be replaced by the unadorned brick facades of merchants ' houses , which gave only hints of wealth through panes of leaded glass : the glitter of a chandelier , the flash of a tapestry , the gleam of a silver serving bowl . From a half-open window came the sound of a drinking song , bellowed by male voices to the accompaniment of pounding pewter mugs . Merchants , home from the Bourse and ready to do their best to keep the price of malted barley high . A marble bridge carried me high over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk into the soft earth . Ahead of me rose the towers of city hall . A small boy sat on the quay , trailing a fishing line in the water . The result of his day 's labors amounted to two carp , strung through the gills , and a frog , which was jumping up and down in a jar . " Say , lad , " I said , in the Lithuanian-influenced patois of the Mississippi River trade . I thought it was a nice touch . " What is the best hotel in town ? " I 've had fellow critics tell me that , when they work in Shadow , they stay in the sleaziest fleabags they can find , because that makes the experience more " real . " I do n't find lice more real , in any ultimate sense , than satin sheets . " The best ? " The boy jumped up eagerly . " The Emperor Kristiaan , on the Streetergracht ! They have marble tubs and gold faucets . And Duc Noh the King of Nam Viet got shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide it , but you can still see the bloodstains if you look . " " Sounds ideal . And do you know how to get there ? "  | " Do I ! I once got thrown out for climbing the flagpole . You can see the whole city from the top ! It 's the tallest flagpole in Sche-kaagau . " He hung the fish on a string around his waist and picked up the jar containing the frog , which began to jump more frantically . " Follow me . " We crossed the tiled dam square , passing the triumphal arch , an explosion of soldiery , waving banners , crosses , and captive Indians pleading for mercy . Somewhere beyond city hall , bells were ringing Angelus . We walked down a narrow street , where merchants were locking up their stalls for the night . The blue lamps that taverns and places of public relief were required to show already glowed at spots along the street , lighthouses for the weary . A few minutes later , we emerged into a square that opened out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other three sides of the square formed the ornate classical pile of the hotel . On top , hanging over us like a burnished artificial moon in the laboratory of a medieval alchemist , a gilded dome caught the last rays of sunlight . Three flagpoles stood in front , the flags those of the hotel , the city of Schekaagau , and the Stadtholderate , in the process of being lowered by a squad of hotel employees in scarlet tunics and knee pants . The boy proudly pointed out the taller , center pole as the cause of his expulsion . I was properly impressed . I reached into my money purse , pulled out a crescent of silver , and flipped it to him . He stared at it in wonder , then stuffed it away in one of the secret pockets boys have . " I better go . Mum will be worried . I 'm late for dinner . " I winked at him , which he liked . " Do n't let me catch you climbing the towers of city hall . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone into the gathering darkness , his captive frog still tucked under one arm . I had never learned his name . It was after I had been lost for quite some time that I noticed I was being followed . For a moment , in my drunken state , that was funny . The poor fool thought he was going to end up in a nice hotel lobby with plush chairs and a bar where he could get a latenight glass of arrack , but instead he was doomed to wander with me through back alleys and unlit warehouse-lined streets for the rest of the night , his path constantly disrupted by dark flowing canals . That was not why he was following me , of course , and I quickly ceased to find his company amusing . I glanced over my shoulder as I turned a corner . He was dressed in some sort of robes , not normal clothes at all , and did n't seem to know the streets any AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 147  | better than I did . I emerged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of heavy granite posts holding a chain . The river unwed quickly here , constrained by the quays , and I could hear its churning and grumbling . Out in the darkness a procession of torchlit barges , loaded to the gunwales with masquers , drifted on the reflected waters of the river . They laughed and screamed and seemed to be having a terrific time , just as they had when I was with them , though I had not enjoyed them at all . I had drunk too much , and almost gotten sick . I had taken a walk to clear my head and work out my thoughts on my critical analysis . I doubted anyone had noticed my absence . Despite the threat at my back , my main emotion was still annoyance . The judgment of a good critic never relaxes . Peter Lucas had made a specialty of this sort of genre piece , and I was getting tired of it . It irritated me to think that I had another day to spend here before the Key the Lords had implanted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the real world . To think of all of Lucas 's labor in twisting human history , to create yet another set of drunken shipping magnates and aldermen in fancy masquerade pounding mugs on wooden trestle tables and pissing heartily over the sides of their barges . It made me sick . Lucas demonstrated that there was an infinite number of redundant possibilities , like a gallery hallway lined only with paintings of courting couples , or children playing with a little furry dog . I did n't know what Lucas had done to history in order to create this Shadow , what kings and queens he had given fevers , what storms he had raised , what matings he had arranged , what battles he had altered , in order for William Vlekke of Antwerp to discover this place so that Schekaagau stood on the shores of Lake Vlekke , rather than Chicago on Lake Michigan , and did n't get much more of a chance to think about it , because my pursuer decided that that was a good moment to jump me . His attack was theatrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim and strong underneath the heavy wool robes , but he was more enthusiastic than skilled , and I threw him off . He hit the ground heavily , then rolled and came up with a glittering curved knife in his hand . I backed away . He did n't seem to be trying to rob me. f le had other things in mind . My ridiculous clothes suddenly seemed as constricting as a straitjacket . He came forward with his blade dancing before him . It was a beautiful piece of work , I noticed , with an elegantly patterned silver hilt . It would look wonderful sticking out of my chest in the morning light . Critics of Shadow are used to such things , however , and I was  | not as defenseless as I looked . As he came at me , I pulled a packet of powder out of a pocket and threw it at him , squeezing my eyes shut at the same time . Even through my closed lids , the flash of the powder left an afterimage . He shrieked and stumbled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , moved in , and punched him at the angle of his jaw . This was unfair , but I was n't feeling sporting that night . His head snapped back and he yelped . He slashed back and forth with his blade , still not able to see anything , but dangerous nevertheless . I dodged in and hit him again , and he stumbled and fell . His head crunched sickeningly against one of the granite posts , and he rolled over the side of the quay into the water . For a long moment I stood swaying drunkenly , trying to figure out where he had gone . Then I ran up and looked over the edge . Water roared heavily below in the darkness , but there was nothing else to be seen . I slipped the brass knuckles off my hand and started to try to find my way home again . It was a long while before I found the square in front of the hotel , and I was still shaking when I did . A marble bathtub is a beautiful thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I finally slid into the bath and was able to relax my muscles . The attack had left me with a number of bruises , but no answers . Answers were sometimes scarce in the many worlds of Shadow , which the Lords had caused to be created for their mysterious pleasures . But the municipal river patrol would be pulling a body out of the weir at the dam in the morning , and I had no idea why he had tried to kill me , and I like to have reasons for things like that . Cuzco , Schekaagau . . . Had the Lords tired of my aesthetic sniping ? Was I simply paranoid ? That was an occupational hazard . I knew I would get no answers that night , so I got out of the bath , toweled myself dry , and went to bed . I turned the key on the gaslight , dimming it to a blue glow . The boy had been real , though . Give Lucas that much . Everyone else seemed like a moving waxwork , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the Lords enjoyed " reality " in that sense , since they themselves did not seem particularly real to me . Reveling in the feel of satin against skin , I turned over in bed to find myself staring at the patterned silver hilt of a knife , still vibrating from its impact , that had somehow come to be embedded in the bedpost next to my head . The motif was one of eyes and lightning bolts . The last knife I had seen like that was now at the bottom of the Schekaagau River . I wrenched the knife from the bedpost and ran to the window , but my second attacker had already slid down the drainpipe and vanished , leaving me with a souvenir of my night at the Emperor Kristiaan . AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 149  | " Mutated E. coli , " Salvator Martine said . He had pulled me away from the other guests at his party to give me this information . I swirled the Tokay in my glass and watched it sheet down the sides . " E. coli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tokay before dinner . Martine grinned , bright teeth in a face of tanned leather . He was annoyingly handsome , and smelled sharply of myrrh and patchouli . The Lords loved him , for no good reason that I could see . Several had even come to attend his party . " Normal intestinal flora . Mutated and hybridized with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Infects via the GI tract and destroys the central nervous systems of higher primates . Neat . Grew it in the guts of an Australopithecine on the 1frican veldt , two , three million years ago . Not easy , Jacob , not easy . When I woke up on that pallet at Centrum , I had bedsores , and . i headache that lasted a month . Killed them all . Every last one of the buggers .

We stood on the parapet of what he called his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party , voices and clinking glasses , background music , occasionally a laugh . The sun set beyond rolling green hills . From a distant ridge came the cry of a deer . A trail of mist descended on the valley , glowing in the evening light . Except for the ones behind us in the party , there were no other humans on the planet . " Infectious lateral sclerosis ... , " I murmured to myself . This was art ? Martine laughed . " Not to worry . With no hosts , it died out , and there are no other vectors . I was careful about that . " He 'd misunderstood my moodiness , of course , but it took a particularly impervious cast of mind to be a molder of worlds . Martine had succeeded in wiping out all of humanity , collateral branches to boot . By some standards , that made him a god . A god with bedsores . That left me with a blank canvas to look at , but nothing to review , which was perhaps his intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hears it , that 's one thing , but when the acorn is worm-devoured and the tree never exists , what sound does it make then ? " You are looking at Berenson 's new world next ? " " Yes . She 's been very mysterious about it , but I suspect ? " A voice interrupted us . " There you are . The most notable men at the party , and the two of you stand out here watching the sunset . Where 's your sense of social responsibility ? " We both turned . Amanda , my wife , closed  | the door behind her , passing through in the roar of voices . She wore a dress that fell in waves of green-and-blue silk , and she emerged from it like Aphrodite from the foam , her blonde hair braided and coiled around her head . A moonstone glowed in its silver setting as it rested on her forehead . " We were waiting for you , " Martine said with that charming insincerity that Amanda seemed to like . She came up and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll have you know , Salvator , that Jacob detests sweet drinks before dinner . " She took another , and kept the glass . " I 've been wandering around your palace . It 's wonderful ! How did you ever create anything like it ? " I felt a surge of annoyance . The palace was a monstrosity . It had towers , with pennants snapping in the breeze . It had triumphal staircases . It had flying buttresses . It had colonnades . What it did n't have was structure . It looked like an immense warehouse of architectural spare parts . " It was built by some people from a world I did a few years back . Remember it , Jacob ? The Berbers of the Empire of the Maghreb ruled Northern Africa . They flooded the desert and built great palaces . I had planned that . " He turned to Amanda . " As I recall , Jacob did n't like it much . " He recalled correctly . I could n't remember much about that particular work , just hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't liked it . The Lords had bid it up , though , and it was now in someone 's collection , making Martine wealthy . Critics should never socialize with artists ; it 's difficult enough to like their work in the first place . Amanda came up and pushed herself against me . Her perfume smelled of violets , and I lost track of what I was thinking . I put my arm around her , and she pulled away , as she always did once she had my attention , and walked to the other side of the parapet to enjoy the sunset . Amanda had once been close to me , but was now distant , and I could n't remember when that had changed . It could have happened overnight , since Amanda often went to bed loving and woke up cold . Something she saw in her dreams , I 'd always thought . But now it was that way most of the time , and I felt I 'd let something slip by , as if we 'd had an immense knock-down-drag-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the infrequent occasions when we made love it was like two people sawing a tree trunk , the length of the saw between us and only the rhythm of the task keeping us together . This still left me wanting to do it much more often than she did . AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 151  | Voices shouted for Martine inside , so the three of us went in through the French doors . The banqueting hall was an immense room , thirty feet high , and banners from the Shadows Martine had created hung down from the beams supporting the ceiling . Someone pressed a glass of wine into my hand , not Tokay , mercifully , hut some dry red . The party poured after Martine as he strode through the hall , out the double doors at the other end , and down the immense stairway . At the bottom rested a cube wrapped in black velvet , about six feet high . It had been delivered through the hallways by servants available to the Lords . Despite myself , I was impressed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shadow to Shadow . " Let 's carry her up , " Martine said , and the party surged forward with cheers . It took a half-dozen people to lift it . " Take my place , Jacob , " Martine said , and I found myself with a shoulder under one corner of the cube . We angled it back and , cursing and laughing , hauled it up the stairs . It was heavy and tried to slide back . I started to sweat . A space was cleared on the floor among the armchairs and the tables covered with half-finished drinks . The cube was put down . I looked for Amanda in the crowd but could n't find her anywhere . I remembered what she was wearing , and her moonstone , but was n't sure that I knew what she looked like anymore . It seemed that as she had grown more distant her face had stopped being familiar . " This is from a world I did recently . It 's not worth visiting , believe mc , but it did produce one thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it back for my collection . " He pulled on a cord , and the black velvet fell to the floor . The crowd grew silent and drew back , but no one took his eyes away . The most beautiful woman in the world was in Hell , but she had been turned to stone and no one could do anything about it . She stared at us from behind five inches of leaded glass with pleading in her eyes . She was a Madonna , and a newborn child lay in her lap . His eyes stared blankly upward , for He had been born hideously blind . I had more information than Martine thought I did , from my sources at Centrum . I knew that Martine had caused eight entire worlds to be destroyed by nuclear war before he got the effect he wanted . On the last try , a group of artists , vomiting , losing their hair , seeing the constant glimmer of optic nerves degenerating in the radiation flux , had found a boulder in a blast crater and set it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had killed the sculptors as they chiseled it . They had worked as one , and it was impossible to tell where one artist had left off and the next  | began . They had created a masterpiece , probably not even knowing why , but Martine claimed this work as his own . Radioactive fantasies had been fashionable among the Lords lately . I turned and walked away , rubbing my shoulder . The party was getting loud again , despite the pleading eyes of the Virgin Mary , and I felt a little sick . I walked down a long hallway lined with loot from Martine 's various creations . I stopped in front of one paint ing , of Christ being carried drunk from the Marriage at Cana by the Apostles . It looked like a rather murky Titian , all droopy flesh and blue mist , but Amanda had pointed it out specifically to me earlier in the day . She never really seemed to care much about art herself , but she somehow always knew precisely what I would like . Or would not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows on straight-backed chairs , like Egyptian deities , were two Lords , Jurum and Altina , who seemed to be married , although it was hard for me to tell . At any rate , they were always together . " Good evening . " I bowed , but did not speak further . " We 've just been looking at Martine 's little collection , " Altina said , her voice a gentle hiss . " Symbols and parts , it seems to us . Reflections of worlds in objects , and so an imitation of our strings of Shadow . What say you ? " They awaited my judgment . Lords are strange beings . They collect worlds the way children collect brightly colored stones and seashells , but require others both to create those worlds and to determine whether they are worth having . They had gained control of the infinite universe of Shadows before anyone could remember , raised Centrum , and seemed intent on continuing in this position forever . Had one of them decided to kill me ? The fact that two attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to give their efforts a bad review . " The objects have significance in themselves , and not just as signs to Shadow , " I said . The Lords often had trouble understanding ordinary art . " This statue of Apollo , for instance . . . " They stood and listened , Altina resting slightly on Jurum 's arm , as I took them through Martine 's collection , which ranged from the brilliant to the mediocre , and seemed to have been forgotten here , like junk in an attic . They thanked me , finally , and walked off to bed , discussing what I had said . I realized that the party above had grown silent and that it was time for bed . When I returned to the banqueting hall , it was empty save for the tormented Virgin . I stopped to look at her , but her expression had become reproachful , as if I were somehow responsible for her fate . I turned away and went to our room . AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 153  | The bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . I took my clothes off , threw them on the floor , and climbed in under the covers . Our room was in one of those dramatic towers , and there was nothing but darkness outside the windows . I fell asleep . Amanda woke me up as she slipped into bed , sometime later . I started to say something , to ask where she had been . " Shh , " she said . " I did n't mean to wake you . " She hunched up on the other side of the bed , the way she did so often , even though the bed was not particularly large and this meant that she dangled precariously over the edge . I moved closer to her and nuzzled her neck . " Please , Jacob . It 's late and I want to sleep . See you in the morning . " She yawned and was quickly asleep , or at least pretended to be .

Interpolated quotations from the Old Testament emerged in yellow , while those from the New Testament were light blue . Unavoidable references to Muslim physicists flashed a gory infidel red . I gazed out from under my cowl , impressed but unenlightened . I do n't know anything about nuclear physics , and even when I thought I had managed to pick up the thread of an argument , I was immediately thrown off by a gloss on Thomas Aquinas or Origen . I contented myself with smelling the incense and watching the glitter of the LEDs on the rosaries of the other monks as they checked the Capuchin 's calculations . He turned from the glass and faced his audience . He raised his arms in supplication to Heaven , then clapped his hands together . ' I'he equations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pancrator , His brow clouded by stormy judgment , lightning ready to be unleashed from His imperial hands . " Brothers ! " the monk said . " All is in readiness .

We will now examine this flame , and if it is not found wanting , its hunger will soon consume the arrogant cities of all those who would oppose the Will of God ! " We rose to our feet and followed him up the stairs to the surface . It was dry and bright outside , and the sky was a featureless blue .  | We segregated ourselves by Order , the gray of Dominicans to the right , the brown of Franciscans to the left , and the martial oriental splendor of the Templars and Hospitalers in the center . There were last-minute checks of the dosimeters , and several of the more cautious had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In front of us , across the cracked , dried mud , amid the rubble of what had once been the city of Venice , stood the Campanile of St. Mark 's , looking the same as it did in a Canaletto painting , except for the fact that the gray ovoid of the atomic bomb rested on a frame on top of the steeply pitched roof . Nearby , the crumbled dome of the cathedral lay on the ground like an overturned bowl . At a distance stood the crazily leaning Rialto bridge . All around , the flats of the dry lagoon stretched away . A trumpet call rang through the air . We repaired to our trenches , all now monastic grasshoppers with our goggles and breathing tubes . We knelt , facing the tower , and the bomb . When the blast came , it looked , in my goggles , like a bright glowing dot that faded quickly to red , and then darkness . The blast shoved at the shielded robe , and I felt the heat on my face . The sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . I pulled up my goggles . The ruins of Venice had been replaced by a smoking crater . The mushroom cloud towered overhead like a cowled monk of a different Order . In sudden unplanned fervor , the monks began to pull themselves out of the safety of the trench and march toward the crater . I , of course , was with them , though I felt like a fool . A resonant bass voice started the tune , and the rest of us joined in : Dies irae , dies ilia Solvet saeclum in favilla Teste David cum Sybilla .. . The Latin held a wealth of allusion lost in the English : Day of wrath ! Day of mourning ! See fulfilled the prophets ' warning Heaven and Earth in ashes burning ! We knelt by that smoking scar and prayed until night fell . My limbic Key brought me back to the hallways of Centrum , vomiting and almost unconscious . Someone found me and hauled AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 157  | c out , a long way , since it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , though somehow I doubted that it had been a Lou ! . The Medical Ward was high up and had large windows that let the sunlight in , unusual in the rest of the Centrum . It was a bright day outside , and I could see the endlessly repetitive walls and blocks of black rock that made up the home of the Lords of Time , stretching out to the horizon . There were no gardens in the pattern , no sculptures , and few windows . Centrum stretched over a large part of the continent some still called North America . I thought the Medical Ward abutted on the Rockies , but I was not sure , though I had already been here twice . My head pulsed and I felt disoriented . The ward was filled with the real effects of Shadow . A theoretical anthropologist , his arms and legs replaced by assemblages of ebony , cedar , and ivory by a race of mechanically inclined torturers , lay spread-eagled on his bed , asleep . Each twitch in his shoulder or hip sent dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there like a windup toy . In the corner lay a fat man who had been participating in a stag hunt through the forests of Calvados , in some world that still had a Duke of Normandy , when a cornered aurochs had knocked over his horse and given him a compound fracture of the femur . He 'd lain in some canopied bed , surrounded by porcelain and Shiraz carpets , dying of tetanus , while the colorful but medically ignorant inhabitants of that Shadow crossed themselves and prepared a grave in the local churchyard . When the timing signal in his Key finally came , he 'd pulled himself out of bed and through the Gate to the hallway , just as I had . The man in the bed next to mine , who gasped hoarsely every few minutes , had gotten drunk , wandered into the wrong part of town , and been beaten by some gang . This was familiar to me too . It could have been any town , the Emperor of Zimbabwe 's summer capital on Lake Nyanza , or Manhattan , minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schekaagau . It did n't really matter . He moaned again . " Ah , The Suffering Critic . ' A work to gladden the heart of any artist . " Standing at the foot of my bed , with a bouquet of multicolored daisies , was a dark , bearded man with a slight twist of amusement to his mouth . That quirk was there so often that it had permanently distorted the muscles of his face , so that he always wore the same expression , like a mask . Masks do n't reveal , they conceal , something it was easy to forget . Amanda had sent me an even dozen long-stemmed red roses , which loomed over me where I lay . He read the card , which just  | said " Get Well " and nothing else , and with the impatient gesture of a god eliminating an improperly conceived species of flatworm , he pulled them out of the vase and threw them away . He shoved his own daisies in their place . This done , he sat down in the chair next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend . You look like hell , and your hair is falling out . " " You 're too kind , Samos . " " Do you know of any reason why anyone would want to kill you ? " He peered at me to see what my reaction would be . I stared at him for a second before I thought of a response . " Samos , I 'm a critic . " " Point well-taken . But you have n't answered my question . " " Samos , when you come to visit a sick friend in the hospital , you 're supposed to make small talk , not start off with ? " " The fact that I suspect someone of trying to kill you ? " Halicarnassus was remorseless . " Not telling you that as soon as possible would be crass impoliteness . However , if you insist . On the way here I saw some cumulus clouds .

" I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To answer your question , Samos , no , I do n't think someone 's trying to kill me . Do you ? " He grimaced . " I 'm not sure . It 's just that the shielding in your robe was good , everything was in order , calculations from your dosimeter indicate that you absorbed a dose of somewhat over twenty rem , high but not fatal , and yet you were almost dead when they got you here . Do n't you find that odd ? " " How did ? " I stopped . It was useless to ask Halicarnassus how he found these things out . He seemed to know all the back stairs of Centrum , including which steps creaked . " I do n't , unfortunately , find getting radiation sickness after walking into a fresh blast crater particularly odd , no . " " Let me remind you of the fate of one of your predecessors , who died in a zeppelin explosion while eating coq au vin off a silver plate in the company of the Duc de Moscau . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gambino was reviewing one of Nobunaga 's worlds , if I remember . His people are colorful , but tend to be indifferent engineers .

AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 159  | In an infinite number of Shadows , an infinite number of things happen . But here 's an interesting thought . Can you conceive of two worlds that differ in only one important detail ? " It was a relief to talk shop , rather than death . I had n't caused anyone 's suicide . Not that I knew about . " What do you mean ? " " Say I create two Shadows , identical in everything , except in one the writing in books is boustrophedon , like the ancient Greeks did it , with alternate lines going right to left . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to move your eyes back to the beginning of each line . " I liked the idea . " Or two Shadows , but in one men kiss , rather than shaking hands .

" We laughed and explored the idea , and the thought of murder , never quite reasonable to begin with , was forgotten . " Jacob ! " Amanda finally flounced in , wearing a red dress , not one I remembered ever having seen before . She pecked me on the forehead , then sat down in the chair and rearranged the pleats of her dress until they lay in the proper pattern . Then she smiled at me . Behind her , moving silently , was Martine , holding a box . My head was pulsing again , and I felt disoriented . I blinked my eyes , but it did n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if there was something improper there . Halicarnassus stared back expressionlessly , then bowed . Amanda smiled tightly , Martine did nothing . " Good day , Jacob , " Halicarnassus said , patted my shoulder , and was gone . They had brought me cookies , airy things of almond and spice . Amanda had made them . I had n't known she could bake . They brought me cookies . Symbols are not only in books , but help us sec the structure of our own lives . Each cookie shattered as I bit into it , then stuck to my teeth . Martine avoided this problem by swallowing his whole . Martine was desperate to know what Halicarnassus and I had been discussing , but did n't want to ask . I ignored his ever more pointed hints with sickbed stupidity , and left him frustrated . It was iticager satisfaction . Amanda chattered , more talkative than I 'd seen her in months . I watched the delicate curve of her throat and shoulders . She talked about the weather , about jewelry , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her tastes were depen-  | dent on the important others in her life , but she 'd been mine for so long that I had forgotten , and was startled to hear her criticizing works that I loved , and thought she had also . I lay back and listened to them , until their voices were just a buzz . Life was full of troubles , and I had more important things to worry about than exploding zeppelins . I had n't been in Halicarnassus 's new world for more than five minutes when I saw her . I should have known better than to be in his Shadow in the first place , but I 've never been able to resist an exclusive showing , even knowing his habit of unpleasant tricks . Halicarnassus had always enjoyed forcing societies into unnatural forms , unhealthy adaptations . He 'd done an ornate Victorian-style Europe full of confectionary palaces and light operas , which practiced brutal cannibalism at fancy-dress dinner parties , a hereditary American Congress full of dangerously inbred religious fanatics who dressed in drag when deciding on bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Plains kept free of habitation from the Mississippi to the Rockies so that its Mongol conquerors could ride as their ancestors had , while forcing enslaved Europeans to build meaningless monuments larger than the Pyramids . His worlds seemed to disturb most of the Lords , who thought them mocking , and they found few buyers . He got by , somehow , the way artists always have , and still made his art . I came into this world on the bottom level of Grand Central Station , as if I were simply another traveler amid the scurrying mobs , who carried me up into the light of the streets above . Just a few blocks away , near St. Patrick 's Cathedral , I saw Amanda , her blonde hair curled and flowing , crossing 50th Street on Fifth Avenue , obviously in a hurry . I did n't stop to think , but followed her trim gray-suited figure as she walked down the street , carrying a briefcase . The people of this Shadow did not dress brightly , or use much color on their buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedrals that had never been built . So Amanda , always in fashion , dressed here in discreet urban camouflage . Love is a random process , depending on such improbable events as an introduction by mutual friends followed by a chance meeting in an exhibit of etchings , and a common liking for a certain sweet wine punch that now , in memory , makes me gag . Or perhaps not so improbable : I later found out that Amanda had gone to that gallery because she knew I would be there . She has never learned to like copperplate etchings , though she pretended to , at the time .  | The loves of our ancestors were equally random . Exact duplicates of individuals seldom exist from Shadow to Shadow , despite Halicar-nassus 's elaborate plans for almost duplicate worlds , so we almost never get to see ourselves in a different life . Was there a Jacob Landstatter in this world ? A Salvator Martine ? So I followed her , my heart pounding . Her waist and her hips were just the same , and she swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stopped at street corners , she looked up at the tops of the buildings , shading her eyes , as if searching for roosting storks , or gargoyles . Her walk was quick , even on heels , and I had to concentrate on keeping up , difficult on the crowded street . She continued for quite a distance , finally coming to the edge of a large green park called , with no particular originality , Central Park . This was a strange mechanical Shadow , full of flying machines and automobiles . It was incredibly noisy . She finally turned into a large gray building called the Metropolitan Museum of Art . I paused at the base of the stairs for a long moment . Banners announced special exhibits of eighteenth-century French crystal , Japanese swords , and the works of a Rembrandt van Rijn . Dutch again . I was tired of Dutch . I followed her up the stairs and into the museum . It was Rembrandt that she wanted , and she went straight there through the maze of corridors . It was an exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-portraits of that same Rembrandt van Rijn , from rather boorish youth to brooding old age , in a variety of strange headdresses . The man was obviously a genius , and I lost myself in his intricate lines . " He is remarkable , is n't he ? " she said , at my side . " I took some time off from work to come see him . This is the last day it 's going to be here . " I turned slowly to look at her . Her eyes were the same too , lighter blue within dark , under long soft lashes . She looked down when I met her gaze , then glanced back up . There was no sign of recognition in her eyes . No Jacob Landstatter in this world . Until now . She smiled . Here she smelled like wildflowers , something other than violets . We found ourselves strolling around the exhibit together , giving each other details of the various etchings as gifts . Some of her remarks were critical , and I suspected that she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did . " I do n't know what I should do now , " she said , looking up and down the street after we emerged . " I do n't really want to go back to work ... it 's too nice a day . " She glanced at me , then looked away .  | I suggested we get a drink , and she took my arm as we walked . I felt like an idiot . What was I doing ? It was a beautiful spring day , and our steps matched as we walked . She looked up again , at the corner , and we discussed the cornices of buildings , the eaves of the roof of the house she had grown up in , the strange places birds manage to relax , and hidden roof gardens in Manhattan . It had been a long time since I 'd enjoyed a conversation quite that much . She flirted with intent , and smiled when she looked at me . " I 've been so lonely , " she said . Suddenly she froze , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretending to admire her reflection and correct her hair . " Oh shit , " she said under her breath . " Oh damn . Oh damn . Why is he here ? " I looked up and down the street , and had no problem spotting him , no problem at all . He walked with his head held up and his arms swinging , and wore a floppy shirt from South America . His right hand was stained with chrome yellow and viridian . Still an artist , even here , Salvator Martine strode past , his eyes fixed on an image invisible to everyone else on the street , and did not see us . I glanced at Amanda . She was trembling as if with a chill . Her left hand pulled at her hair , and she looked vulnerable , like an abandoned child . It was only then that I noticed the glint of a gold wedding band on her finger , and it all made sense . " Who was that ? " I asked . " Who ? Oh . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " Let 's go . " I went with her , but everything inside of me had turned to ice . I managed to disengage myself from her after drinks but before dinner , to her obvious dismay . She liked me , and found me attractive . I felt a fool for still wanting her , like a small child who wants to play with shards of glass because they glint so prettily in the sun , but I could n't help it . We made a date to meet at the Museum of Modern Art the following week , for an exhibition of Rothko . She would be there , but I would n't be . It would be another two days before my Key would allow me back through the Gate into the hallways . They had something called television here , moving images in a box . I decided to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the time and watch it . When I returned home , I knew Amanda , my Amanda , the real Amanda , had finally gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her things were gone from her bureau . I walked through the entryway , down the hall , and into the quiet AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 163  | room , where I settled into a low couch facing the green moss-filled garden . The chuckle of the stream flowing through it was vivid in the silence . Why did I hurt ? Because I , of all possible Jacob Landstatters , had finally lost my Amanda , out of all possible Amandas ? Does a minute flux in the probability stream feel pain ? Nonsense . The pain was real , perhaps , but I was n't . I waited to vanish . But cardiac muscle does n't know anything about alternate probability worlds , or Shadow , or feelings of unreality , or the Lords . My heart continued beating . My diaphragm continued to pull downward , filling my lungs with air . My stomach rumbled . I was hungry . I got up to make myself a sandwich . The kitchen was clean and silent . Copper pots and steel utensils hung over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the open window . The breadbox contained half a loaf of rye bread , fresh and aromatic . Where the devil had it come from ? Amanda could n't have put it here , she 'd obviously been gone for too long . I hefted it . The crust was crisp . " Stop playing with your food and cut a slice , for God 's sake , " a voice said behind me . I whirled , loaf in hand . Halicarnassus was sitting at the table in the darkened alcove . " It 's impolite to threaten your guests with deadly viands , " he observed . " Cut a slice , I said . I 've got the mustard and roast beef here . " " How kind of you . " He took a luxurious bite of his sandwich . " Give it up , Jacob . Ah . Rye , beef , and mustard . There are some aesthetic verities that transcend reality . The field of gustatory ontology has been much neglected by philosophers . " " So much the worse for ontology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much grace as I could muster . I really was quite hungry . " So much the worse for philosophers ! All this Truth and Beauty stuff is fine , but it obscures the real issues . Rye bread ! I try never to create a world in which it can not be found . One must have an absolute aesthetic criterion to give an anchor to one 's life . " There are worse ones , I suppose . " Did you create that entire world to give me an object lesson about my personal life ? " " Hey , they have great rye bread in that city . Do n't be such an egotist , Jacob . I put that in as a little detail , an ironic reference , like a dog crapping in the corner of a hunting scene . No artist is going to create an entire world just to please one critic 's vanity . That 's a real world , full of real people . Just like this one . " I had been suspicious for a long time , about the Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to risk the question . 164 THE BREATH OF SUSPENSION  | " Did you create this world , Samos ? " He grimaced . " Yes , and not one of my better efforts , I must say . The Lords are an insufferable bunch , and Centrum is ... excessive . " " Where are you from ? " He passed a hand over his forehead . " You know , I 'm not even sure I remember . A lot of white stone buildings . Apple orchards . A big blue sky . Does n't tell you much , does it ? I guess it did n't tell me much either . But I remember school , a big hall with a dome , and my first world . It was a clunky thing , with brass-and-mahogany steam carriages and wars full of cavalry charges and solemn republics whose capital cities were always built of white marble and top-hatted ambassadors who exchanged calling cards and people who lived , breathed , and died , just like they did at home . I went to live there , a requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just made worlds , Shadows you call them here , and moved on , sometimes into one of mine , usually into one I stumbled onto made , presumably , by someone else . " " So yours was the real world . " " Jacob , I 've always been amazed at your inability to detach your emotions from your intellect . That world was created as a private project by a man from a culture so different from this one that my mind does not retain any information about it at all . He was ancient when I was a child , the grandmaster of the school . He died much honored , since he was , I suppose , God . " He cut himself another slice of bread . " It would be nice to be certain one existed , but as long as we spend our time twisting time like this , rather than on more rational pursuits , none of us ever will be sure . Most of the inhabitants of the worlds I have created at least believe they exist , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these absurd Keys in your limbic systems to give you all a sense of reality , since you always feel like you are coming home . A nice touch . You , incidentally , no longer have one . " I remembered my strange dizziness and disorientation at the medical ward . At the time , I had chalked it up to radiation sickness . " How did you manage that ? " " Friends at the hospital in Centrum , willing to do me a favor . And why should n't they ? I created them , after all . It 's really a simple modification , and performed more often than you might think , even in this most real of all possible worlds . " He ate the rest of his sandwich and stood up . " Well , that 's enough for now . You 'll be seeing me again , I think . You 're one of my more engaging creations . " " Oh , shut up . " I put my head in my hands . This was too much . " Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' BALL 165  | " What do you know about my next job ? " He grinned maliciously . " It 's by Martine . " I choked on my food . " That son of a bitch has taken off with my wife . " I stopped . It hurt . It was surprising how much it hurt . " Do n't worry . It 's no more real than anything else . " " It 's no less real . My guts feel like they 've been caught by a fishhook . " " And you sneer at gustatory ontology . Good day , Jacob . " And he walked out the door and was gone . The various portions of the Chancellery Gardens of Laoyin harmonized not only in space , but in time . The arrangement of dells and lily ponds , of individual Dawn Redwoods , laboriously dug , full grown , in the fastness of old China and brought here up the Lao River , which I knew as the Columbia , in barges built for the purpose , of stone temples with green bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in a devious wildness but actually existing because of the efforts of dedicated gardeners , took on meaning only when observed at a receptive stroll . I emerged from the yellow-green of a stand of ginkgoes , descended a gorge alongside a stream , and arrived at the rocky shore of a lake , its verge guarded by cunningly twisted pines and Amur maples . I trod the gravel path farther , and felt uneasy . While I strolled , too many others strode purposefully , usually in tight groups of three or four . The vistas were ignored by men who muttered and gestured to each other . Either trouble was brewing , or the inhabitants of this Shadow had decidedly odd ideas of how to enjoy a sunny afternoon in the park . A Bodhisattva blessed my exit with bland beneficence . In contrast to the serene order of the Chancellor 's garden , the city streets beyond were a tangle . What had been intended as triumphal thoroughfares were blocked every hundred paces by merchants ' stalls , religious shrines , or entire shantytowns , complete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been a swirling , delightful mess . However , the streets had the same feeling of oppression as the park . Everywhere there were knots of people discussing dark matters . A scuffle broke out between two groups , one with dark skin and bulbous deformed Mayan heads , shouting loudly and striking out clumsily , the other short , sibilant , with narrow catlike eyes and flat noses , darting with precisely placed energy . Suddenly abashed by the attention they aroused , both groups melted into the surrounding crowds .  | " The Prince is dead . " Everywhere I heard the murmur . " The Prince , murdered . Vengeance , for our Prince . Where is his murderer ? He must be found . He must be killed . The . Prince . Is . Dead . " Each word was a call of anguish . I emerged onto a wide street that had been kept clear . Flatfronted buildings of basalt bulked on either side , all identical . There was a sound down the way , the rhythmic thud of metal drums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible to me , a crowd had gathered . Some of them were dressed in woolen robes that looked suspiciously familiar to me , but there was no time to think about it . Everyone began to sway in time to the beat . As the sound of the drums approached I could hear , over it , the baying of hunting horns . I looked up the street . Sailing toward me like an image from an involuntarily recalled memory was the Face . " Woe ! " the crowd wailed . " 0 woe ! Dead . Dead ! " Tears streamed down every face , and every body moved to the beat of those awful drums . " The Prince ! Woe ! " And the Face continued . It was huge , at least thirty feet high , carved out of some dark gray-flecked rock . The eyes , blank and pitiless , stared into mine , and beyond me , to infinity . The lips were ' curved in a slight smile , like that of a Buddha , but seemed to be arrested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it have been ? A grin ? A scowl ? A grimace of pain , or anger ? Or a mindless nullity ? The Face was of stone and would carry that secret forever . There were creases in the cheeks , and the nose was slightly bent at the end . The Prince was becoming a god , but obviously intended to keep his nose intact . A god is not handicapped by a twisted nose . The sculpture rested on a great wagon , each of its many wheels reaching to twice the height of a man . It was pulled by teams of men and women , volunteers . Everyone wanted to help , and unseemly scuffles broke out for places on the ropes . The drummers seated below the god 's chin occasionally enforced justice by clubbing someone with their brass drumsticks . And the crowd cried " Woe ! " The Face swept by , becoming , from behind , a rough-hewn lumbering mountain of stone . The mood of the crowd changed . Like a shadowed pool of blood in the corner of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black despair of the crowd was revealed as scarlet imperfectly perceived . Icicles grew on my spine as shouts of rage and upraised daggers greeted the approach of the second Face . The daggers .. .  | " Murderer ! " they cried . " Death ! " Though essentially a thirty-foot-high-stone wanted poster , the sculptors had lavished no less care on this Face than on that of the Prince . Its brows were knit in jealous rage , its eyes glowered . Its lips were pulled back in a contemptuous grin , challenging us all to do our worst . Though fleshier and more dissipated than I remembered , the Face was familiar . It should have been . I looked at it every morning in the mirror when I shaved . It was my own . The sculptors had done their work well . So compelling was the Face that no one noticed my real face as , shaking with fear , I slipped through the crowd . Their daggers , with silver hilts chased with a pattern of eyes and lightning bolts , were also familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sticking out of a bedpost next to my head . Martine ! It had been him the whole time . He 'd sent his creations to kill me in Schekaagau , and when that had failed , he 'd exposed me to radiation from his Virgin Mary , so that the cumulative dosage from my visit to Berenson 's radioactive world would kill me . Hell , he 'd probably locked me in my room at Cuzco . But for what ? My wife ? It made no sense , but then , murder often made no sense , at least to the victim . But did n't the idiot know that none of this was real ? So Martine had created this entire world just to kill me , despite what Halicarnassus had said about my ego . I should have been flattered , but it 's hard to feel flattered when you 've pissed in your pants and are fleeing for your life . I quickly became lost in the tangle of streets , though I really had no idea of where I was going , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Laoyin . The houses were all about four stories high , of cracked stucco , and leaned crazily . The air smelled of frying fish and fermented black beans . I turned a corner into a dusty square . A group of locals sat gloomily around a nonfunctioning fountain . I slunk past them , trying to look nonchalant . I almost made it . " Look , Daddy ! " a little boy said , pointing at me . " Prince ! " " No , it is n't . It 's ? " Their knives were out in an instant . They did n't waste time debating points of tactics , but launched themselves at me in a mass . I turned and ran . The tangled streets , confusing enough at a walk , were a nightmare at a dead run . Every few seconds I crashed into a wall or the sharp corner of a building . I began to gain on my pursuers . Despite their hatred , they still had some concern for their bodies . I could not afford to have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself on a wide promenade , paved with multicolored slabs of rock and bordered on my left by an ornamental railing . Through the railing , far below , were the waters of the Lao , as they flowed toward the Pacific . Leaning casually on the railing , as if on the parapet of his palace , was Martine . He nervously held a gun in his hand , as if unsure of what to do with it . He had been unable to resist taking a direct hand in things , despite all of his efforts to set up a perfect trap for me . I was trapped . I stopped . Would he posture , preen , and carry on first , or would he simply gun me down ? Right on the first guess . " At last , " he said . " At last I can have my revenge . " " What ? What the hell are you talking about ? " " You have tormented and ruined me . I did my best , I poured my soul into my art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never enough . " He raised the pistol . " Say your prayers , Jacob . " " Wait a minute , for God 's sake . " " Nothing can stay my hand now , Jacob . Compose yourself for death . " " I 'll compose myself for anything you want , if you tell me what you 're going on about . You 've got Amanda , what more do you want ? " He frowned , confused . " Amanda ? What does Amanda have to do with this ? How can you mock my work , humiliate me , degrade me ? " should have known . I grinned in relief . " Is that it ? You 're all upset because of some lousy reviews ? Do n't be ridiculous . " His finger whitened on the trigger . " You have destroyed me . Now I destroy you . " " For crissakes , Salvator , are you crazy ? Who takes critics seri-ously ? " I was almost in tears . Here I 'd finally found someone who paid attention to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't fair . " Make your peace with God , though I have no doubt that you 'll pick enough with Him that He 'll wish He never created you . " Martine was proving to be an extremely gabby murderer . A knot of people emerged from an alleyway behind Martine . Seeing that he had held me prisoner rather than killing me outright made them smile . It 's always nice when someone is willing to share . I nodded . " All right , Samos . Take him . " Martine snorted . " A feeble ruse , Jacob . " The first man in the group brushed past Martine 's elbow . With a shriek , he turned and fired , blowing the man 's chest open and AT THE CROSS-TIME JAUNTERS ' BALL 169  | leaving him with a surprised and offended expression on his face . Before Martine could get the barrel pointed back in my direction , the blades were into him , silver into scarlet . He screamed once . That done , the blades turned toward me . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morgue , I took three quick steps and threw myself over the railing into the air . I do n't know if I screamed . I know that those behind me did , in disappointment . I watched the river . It did n't seem to get any closer , just more detailed , ripples , whirlpools , and flotsam appearing and sharpening as if on a developing piece of film . I must have remembered Halicarnassus 's modification to my Key subconsciously , because the next instant I found myself , sweating and soiled , in the dark hallway beneath Centrum . She was home , sitting in the quiet room reading a book about Caravaggio . She looked up at me as I entered , smiled , then went back to her reading , saying nothing . It was not a silence that could be easily broken , for it seemed to me that it would shatter into a thousand pieces at the first word . I walked to the bedroom , took a shower , and changed into household clothes . There was no clothing out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers . I breathed . The air smelled , just slightly , of jasmine . Jasmine ? I went to the kitchen . Amanda had cleaned up the remains of the final lunch Halicarnassus and I had had together . I opened the green kitchen curtains to have a view of the garden and began to pull out ingredients . Had the knives always been on the left side of the drawer ? How observant was a critic ? I examined the curtains . Still green . The last time I had seen them , at lunch , they had been red . That I remembered . One Shadow differing from another in only one minor , but significant , way . Amanda and I had had a discussion about those curtains . I had wanted green , but finally gave in . My hand shook a little as I chopped the onions , as I began to realize that Halicarnassus had sent me drifting through Shadow , with no way to ever return to the world I had spent my whole life believing was the real one . I flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the onion peels . Inside , crumpled , was a set of red curtains . A note was pinned to them . " You 'll never know , " it said . " Get used to it . " It did n't need a signature . I stir-fried beef and ginger , and thought about the woman in the other room . Was this the woman I had married , who had be-   trayed me ? Or was this someone else ? If Amanda was different enough that she would not betray me , could I still love her ? I was adrift in a sea of infinite worlds , so I was starting to think that it did n't really matter . I could discuss it with Halicarnassus , when we finally ran into each other again . Somehow , I was sure that we would . When it was finished , I took the food in to Amanda . It tasted very good .   T E S S A W O L H O L M E stood in the shadow of the twisted-trunked banyan that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calrick Bend railway station and watched the distant black speck of the hawk as it soared the updrafts over Angel 's Butte . For an instant she felt almost embarrassed to be standing with two feet on solid ground . The hawk could look down into the endless canyons of Koola 's Western Shield with wide-aspect eyes , taking in with a glance journeys that took the canyon inhabitants days and weeks . If it wished it could see Tessa 's sun-hatted figure , heavy suitcases resting to either side , and then , with just a slide of its eyes , examine the cascading roofs of Hammerswick School in its peaceful box canyon above Perala . The bird , a native of Koola , probably ignored it all , as it did the rest of the inscrutable activities of those alien intruders on its world , human beings . It had taken Tessa two days to make that hawk's-eye-flick journey from Hammerswick to middle Cooperset Canyon . As she stood by the hanging rail , which still vibrated with the train 's departure up-canyon , waiting for her brother Dom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest with a book in Hammerswick 's quiet study garden again . That part of her life was over . Her mother was dead from a sudden wasting fever . Tessa had returned to bury her and , returning , would not leave . She felt as if her own life had just ended as well . The hawk slid directly sideways , scratching its belly on the wind , and vanished behind the rocky plates that made up Dragon 's Back . It did not reappear , and with the disappearance of its eyes , Hammerswick and Perala became definitively part of another world . " Tessa ! " a voice called . She hesitated , as if moving was giving something up , then left her bags and ran toward it . Dom caught her up and swung her . Everything blurred but her   brother 's sturdy face , its tightly curled black hair quite unlike Tessa 's looser brown . He put her down and they looked at each other appraisingly , challenge already beginning . " Town life agrees with you . " His tone concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . " You 've filled out . " " Filled out " was one of those terms older people used to younger ones that Tessa never failed to find annoying . Dom was only eighteen . If he 'd already started talking that way , he was doomed . " I learned a lot there . " She strove to relax . " Oh ? Anything at all useful ? " She tightened her jaw . " That remains to be seen . " Not two minutes with him and she wanted to fight . It must be something about the way older brothers smell . Pheromones . That was it . " So when will you be going back ? You do want to go back , do n't you ? " Trust him to hit her most sensitive spot right off . It was n't pheromones , it was just plain meanness . She was too tired to fight . " I 'm not going back , Dom . That 's what Poppa told me . " She looked out across the dense plantings of the twenty-kilometer-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink canyon walls , which , in turn , ' marched grandly off in either direction . This was her home and it had reclaimed her . " He needs me here . Now that Momma 's gone " Now that Momma 's gone we do n't need anyone else . You can just go back and study ancient interplanetary history or whatever you want . " " Now , Dom Wolholme , there 's no reason to get nasty with me . I just got off the train . I have n't slept all night . And Momma 's dead . " To her dismay she found herself fighting back tears . It did n't make it any easier to see that he was doing the same thing . " Give me a chance . " " Sorry . " Dom apologized the same way he washed dishes , a quick swipe and done . " Fine . Please pick up my bags . " Without waiting to watch him , she hopped on the cart . The low-slung mule glanced back at her , erecting its vertebral spines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its contemplation of a grass clump . " If you do n't decide to eat soon , it 'll be too late . " The mule ignored her . She was clearly a prophet without honor in her own canyon . " God , " Dom grunted behind her . " Everything I own does n't weigh this much . "  | Dom was too demoralized to come back at her , and she was immediately sorry . Momma was dead . She could feel her family loosening around her . And God knew they needed to be tied together . Life on Koola demanded it . Dom yanked at the mule 's reins . It abruptly decided that the grass clump was the most delicious thing it had ever seen , but had time for only one mouthful before it was forced , resentfully , to move off . Calrick Bend was a wide elbow of Cooperset Canyon . The hanging rail ran above the high talus slopes that covered the base of the eastern wall , so Dom and Tessa had a wide sweeping view as they descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there by the terraces of tributary canyons , their outpourings marked by giant boulders . Hundreds of kilometers beyond were the frowning giants of the Boss . One could climb toward them for weeks and find them no nearer . Kardom , the northernmost visible peak , trailed a fine line of snow into a high wind , glowing in the morning light . Despite herself , Tessa thought it had to be one of the most beautiful places on Koola . They dropped into the vine-laced stillness of the fields and were closed in by plants . The lush aromatic air here was not that of the high canyons and mountains . Tessa sniffed at it , trying to decide if she liked it . Unlike the thick air above the salt pans of the Great Valleys , deeper in Koola 's atmosphere , this was an air made by human beings . The mule maneuvered through the kinked lanes with the ease of long familiarity . Tessa found herself craning forward and , after a while , was rewarded by glimpses of the house through the fronds overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing larger the higher up it went , like all farmers ' houses unwilling to take up valuable growing land for the mere business of protecting humans from the elements . The morning sun reflected in its windows . It was a beautiful house , designed by her father , who should have been an architect rather than a farmer . As the wagon approached , the plants grew lower , becoming the kitchen garden , until the entire house was visible at once , as well as the sturdy tower of the Wolholme family ward that rose beside it . The rest of the family waited at the door . Benjamin , three years younger than Tessa 's sixteen standard , stood and cried . He 'd probably been crying for days . He always overdid everything . Standing  | next to Benjamin , one small hand on the doorway to keep himself steady , was Kevin , the youngest . He gazed up at Tessa with grave eyes . Looming over them both was Perin Wolholme , Poppa , a vast balding man who stood blinking at her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with trepidation , for they all looked at her as if she was supposed to do something to make it all work . Then she jumped from the cart and put her arms around her father 's huge chest . Dom and Benjamin squabbled over who should carry Tessa 's bags into the house . Dom , previously resentful of the task , won . Kevin trotted along behind , assisting with one hand under a corner of a suitcase , until he tripped in the doorway . He found something interesting in the pattern of the cut stone and sat there in fascination , completely in everyone 's way . The others went up the stairs to her room , but Tessa stopped in the second-floor living room . Momma had been dead less than three days . The room was already a mess . Not blatantly , but Tessa knew Momma would never have left a clump of tree-training wire hanging by the door , or allowed anyone to set sprouting pots down on the rug . And who had dared to use one of Momma 's large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door swung loose , obviously needing to be rehung . Holding the heavy fossil , she walked to the window . Leafy trees with white blossoms and spiky calyx plants filled the view . On the canyon wall 's next spur hung the great house of the Dalhousies with its many roof terraces . A figure strolled across one , serene in its dominion , but she could n't recognize who it was . The Dalhousies were a large family . She held the trilobite up to the light . Segments gleaming black , its back was twisted , seemingly with the pain of its passing . When she had been younger Tessa had seen the random marks on the rock substrate as the traces of the legs ' last frantic scrabbling . Now she was n't sure . " Benjamin ! " It would do the boy good to have work . He appeared , sniffling . " Put those wires where they belong . Be careful ! If you tangle them it will take all day to get it straight . And when you see him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the living room , not the nursery . The rugs I 'll clean myself . I ca n't expect you boys to handle anything like that . " The last remark was unnecessary but made her feel better . Enough delay . She climbed the stairs to her mother 's room , trilobite under one arm as if to weigh her down . The door swung open at her touch . p 177 Sora lay stretched out on the bed . It could not be mistaken for sleep : in life she had always slept curled up in a ball . She wore the long-waisted gray-and-pink sleeveless dress she had favored at the time Tessa left for school . She 'd been wearing it during the last argument Tessa had with her . Tessa remembered shouting , feeling her face distend with anger , but try as she might she could not remember what the argument had been about . She turned and carefully placed the trilobite , a piece of evidence in that mysterious investigation into the ancient depths of Koola that had been Momma 's abiding private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the keepsakes that crowded there , already dulling with dust . Momma looked older now , without her quick movements to belie the face wrinkled by sun and wind . Her hands were folded prayerfully on her stomach . And  --  Tessa frowned  --  she wore her favorite sunstone ring on her left hand . In Tessa 's life she had never seen Momma wear it other than on her right . Wincing at the feel of dead flesh , she switched it to the proper finger . That was the sign for Tessa to see all the other incongruities in her mother 's appearance . Her makeup was too emphatically applied , her lips an odd shade of red . Tessa remembered Momma bringing the tube back from some exclusive shop in Perala , laughing in dismay at the way it made her look when she finally got it home , and throwing it not in the trash , but , as women do , back in her case . The slim golden tube had obviously caught some unperceptive male eye . Tessa wiped the makeup off with cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't it occurred to anyone that Momma was lying down rather than standing up ? Finally , the X-belt just under the breasts was backward . She switched it around . Her mother felt light in her arms . Tessa let her breath out . Her mother was dead . Protesting voices came up the stairs . Vainly protesting  --  they had a tone of foreseen defeat . The bedroom door swung open , revealing the figure of a ponderous woman with a huge spray of hair , carrying a vast shapeless bag . " Theresa ! " She dropped the bag with a heavy thump and opened her arms . Her voice was a resonant tenor . " Dalka . " Tessa hid her reluctance and slid into the embrace of her mother 's best friend . Dalka 's breasts were extravagantly large , the sort that dismayed rather than comforted men and infants . God knew they dismayed Tessa . In the face of this aggressive statement of matriarchy , her own womanhood became an afterthought . Tessa did n't want to be forcibly comforted . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found herself weeping into Dalka 's capacious bosom . " Oh , Dalka , I never said a nice thing to her . We just fought . What can I say now ? " " Hush , Theresa . No woman expects her sixteen-year-old daughter to love her . No sensible woman , that is , and Sora was as sensible as they come . She knew you 'd understand eventually . " " But did she know I 'd understand too late ? " Dalka just made a comforting noise . " Dalka ... can you help me wash her hair ? " " Surely , Theresa . It is a mess , is n't it ? She was real sick and no one thought much about anything else . " She opened the door , brusquely ordered a basin from whoever was standing there , and found Sora 's aromatic shampoo . Together the two women washed Sora 's hair , then set and dried it , as slowly and patiently as if performing an ancient ritual . The men buzzed around the closed door like disturbed wasps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads through the hair , accenting the curving lines they had put in it . Tessa was astonished by how thick her mother 's hair was . Her own hair was much thinner , but then she lacked much of her mother 's beauty , being stronger and shorter , from Perin 's blood . Dalka picked up Sora 's hand and pulled off the sunstone ring Tessa had just transferred there . She smiled grimly . " We want her to look nice , but there 's no reason in your family 's starving for it . " She started to put the ring back in the jewelry case , then turned and put it on , with some difficulty , over Tessa 's thicker finger . " There . As safe a place for it as I can think . A better memory of your momma than putting it under the fleshgrass at Topfield to be dug up by high plainsmen , is n't it ? " Tessa looked down at the ring and nodded . Perin knocked . " Please . " He held his hands in fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness . He peered over Dalka 's shoulder at his daughter and dead wife , blinking . " The death cart is waiting . We must leave soon if we 're to make Top-field ? " Dalka slapped his shoulder the way one man would another . " Do good by her , will you ? " " I will . Our family is strong enough . " " I hope you 're right . " She turned to look back at Tessa . In the dimness of the hall her eyes seemed extraordinarily large . " I 'll talk with you later , Theresa . " Tessa and Perin stood and listened to the creak of the stairs beneath Dalka 's bulk . p 179 " Well then . Well then . " Perin stood over his wife 's body and looked down at it as if he had found her napping and was wondering whether to awaken her . His large hands dangled loose at his sides . Tessa started to move out of the room , to give her father privacy , but paused at the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , and what had they meant to each other ? Perin knelt by his wife 's side and wept bitter unashamed tears , sobbing so hard he sounded like he was hiccuping . He put an arm around her waist and pulled her to him , resting his head on her shoulder and disarranging her hair . Tessa turned her head away , suddenly feeling her intrusion , but not before she saw , with sick shock , that her father 's hand held her mother 's now-cold breast . Dom and Benjamin stood stony-faced in the hall holding the funeral pallet . The heavy scent of its flowers , woven around the edge by the neighborhood women , filled the hall . It made Tessa dizzy , and she put a hand against a wall to steady herself . " Come in and get her . " Their father 's voice was muffled . " Come . " With an air of exaggerated dignity , the two boys stepped through with the pallet . The men clustered around their dead woman and Tessa stood in the hall , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses in the Shield 's upper valleys , the Wolholme house had a Death 's Door at the rear , just under the cliff . It was used for the exit of a corpse and no other purpose , so that if the dead got lonely in their grave beneath the fleshgrass of Topfield and tried to return home , the only door they could find would be sealed against them . Characteristically , Perin had lavished great care on this almost-always-useless portal . It was surrounded by dark tiling , and the doors themselves were carved with flowers . The foil-and-wax seal over it tore as Perin pulled back the bolt , and the two heavy doors , perfectly balanced , swung open into the noonday sun . Dom and Benjamin , strong wide-shouldered boys , carried Sora lightly on her pallet and slid it onto the high spring-wheeled death cart . They looked so manly and serious that Tessa suddenly felt overwhelmingly proud of them . A few of their neighbors stood among the trees to bid farewell , but most of the people of Calrick Bend would wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their success in carrying the body to its final resting place a reaffirmation of their strength as a family . The cart was ancient and motorized , a common property of the communities of this length of Cooperset Canyon . Parts of it were  | rumored to have come , centuries ago , from Earth itself . They climbed aboard and hummed up-canyon . Calrick Bend 's community cemetery was at Topfield , in the dry , high valleys that backed up against Evening Crest . Funerals were always performed by members of the deceased 's family , a significant test of their strength , stamina , and solidarity . Failure to bury a dead family member at Topfield was an indication that the family could no longer maintain itself or its holdings . Where Sterm Canyon split from Cooperset the road became rough , climbing the dry bed . Coiling tubes emerged from the red rock , turgid with the water they had sucked from deep aquifers , but no one farmed here , and only native Koolan plants grew . The canyon walls were defaced by old mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly here on the Shield , a continent of light rock that rose up out of the dense atmosphere of the flats that made up the rest of the planet 's surface . The embedded remains of heavy asteroids , a possible cause of the Shield 's existence , were the only source of metals . Tessa remembered the story of the Prochnows , who , weary , riven with internal dissension , had spent a week taking their father 's body to Topfield , or so they announced when they returned with the cart . A few weeks later a hunter found the father 's body hidden in an old excavation here in Sterm Canyon , at least two days ' travel from Topfield , which they had never reached . The Prochnow family had been unable to survive the disgrace and had vanished as an organized unit . Better to die , Tessa thought . Better to die in the heights of Evening Crest , lungs drying in the merciless Koolan air , than have the Wolholmes end that way . " Mother came here to hunt her stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous . Indeed , the exposed rock layer flanking the jolting track was dense with a tangle of ancient Koolan seafloor life . " She wanted to understand where we come from , " Tessa said . The men in the family had never understood Sora 's paleontological hobby . But that was n't fair : Tessa had never understood it either . Now it seemed overwhelmingly important that she do so . " We did n't come from here , " Benjamin jeered , with the selfconfidence of the possessor of an inarguable school-approved fact . " We came from Earth . " Tessa eyed him . " I remember when the midwife pulled out a little screaming lump and Poppa named it Benjamin . So I can tell you that you did n't come from Earth . Any further claims ? " p 181 " You know what I mean , " Benjamin began heatedly . " This is no time for fighting , " Dom cautioned . " Tell her that . " " No need , " Tessa said with deliberate serenity . " No need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perin said dreamily , as if his children were n't fighting around him . " Momma ? " Tessa said , argument forgotten . " Here in Sterm Can-yon ? " Perin nodded . " She was trying to free a fossil . I heard her swearing before I saw her . She thought she was alone and was embarrassed when she saw me . But I helped her . " Tessa could almost see the scene : her impatient mother , young , at a disadvantage , but unwilling to reject the help , and Perin 's large , careful hands working a chisel around the delicate trapped fossil as he glanced , thoughtfully , at the odd woman he had unexpectedly cornered . " Which fossil was it ? " Tessa asked . He frowned . " I do n't remember . It was n't very large . Kind of lacy . I 'm sure it 's still in the collection somewhere . " " And why were you here ? " Dom and Benjamin leaned forward while Kevin dozed , curled up with a hand over his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were willing to let her ask all the questions . " A funeral , what else ? " He looked up Sterm Canyon toward the cliffs that marked its end . " My mother 's , then . I had let the cart with my family go ahead , and was walking alone . After then , your mother walked with me . " " You persuaded her to come with you ? " Tessa was distressed to hear the tone of doubt in her voice . But how had the gentle , shambling Perin persuaded the intent Sora to leave her task , her joy , and come with him ? For the first time since his daughter had come home , Perin smiled , remembering . " No , Tessa . I wanted to go ahead alone . I had just stopped to help , nothing else . It was she who insisted on coming with me . " Clearly unwilling to answer any further questions , Perin settled back , crossed his arms , and closed his eyes . But traces of the justpassed smile remained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at the funeral encampment , an open area around a water seep . One other family , with the body of a young child , stayed at the opposite end of camp , but the two families did not speak . In the morning , by  | unspoken agreement , the Wolholmes moved out at first light , taking the death cart as far as the base of the switchback Topfield trail . Just where the trail rose toward its first switchback was a pair of giant fossil trilobites , each about two meters long . An entire fivemeter layer of the cliff face was filled with such fossils , but these were by far the largest , flanking the path like guardians . Centuries of human hands touching them for luck had rubbed them smooth . Her mother had particularly thought of them as lucky , Tessa remembered , representatives of the native Koolan forces that the human settlers had yet to come to terms with . At home was a photograph of a four-year-old Tessa perched on one , smiling ner-vously . It was a long heavy climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pallet and their mother 's body . The spiky plants along the trail twisted slowly when they sensed the moisture of the human beings . Tear-drinking flies , a symbol of funerals , settled on their cheeks to reclaim some salty water . After several hours ' climb , Tessa leaned out and looked down the cliff face to the canyon below . The tiny figures of the family with the dead child were just commencing their climb . Their heads were down , concentrating on each step . The cliff edge was sharp . One moment the Wolholmes were climbing desperately up the face , breath sharp in their lungs , the next they stood on the wide fleshgrass-covered expanse of Topfield . Fleshgrass lived on the bodies buried beneath it . When this barren high valley had become Calrick Bend 's community cemetery , there had been only sparse clumps of it here and there on bare dirt . Now it lapped up at the distant hills as if desperate to climb toward the higher mountains that loomed beyond . Dom led the family a long way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , that satisfied him . The fleshgrass was thick under their feet . Dom , Benjamin , and Tessa pulled out the folding shovels that had been stowed under the pallet and marked the grave . Kevin had brought , on his own , a toy shovel and with childish concentration straightened the line of his older siblings ' cut . The soil beneath the fleshgrass was loose and easy to dig . It did n't take long to empty a hole deep enough for their mother . The roots would grow through her in days . As far as Tessa knew , clothes and jewelry would remain below , for all the tales she 'd heard of wedding rings being found waving on fleshgrass fronds . It was also said that high plainsmen sometimes descended from their encampments beyond the Boss and dug through the ground seeking valu-ables. p 183 They slid Sora 's body off the pallet into the ground and covered her over . Tessa turned away as her mother 's still face vanished beneath the dry gray soil . " We 'll survive , Sora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like I promised you . " Benjamin made an inarticulate sound in his throat and pointed . They all looked up . No more than a hundred meters away stood a Great Wapiti , a huge quadruped , two meters at the shoulder , with curving knifeedged horns . It was a native of Koola , though had been given some approximate name from an animal of old Earth . " My God , " Dom muttered . " It 's so close . So close ! " The wapiti stalked along , graceful and powerful , as if aware of their impotence and the solemnity of their task . At last , coming near a rock slope , it crouched and , with an incredible leap , vanished . Benjamin looked after it . " Look ! " He pointed . " A troop of high plainsmen . You can just see their horses . They must be hunting the wapiti . " Tessa squinted to see what he saw . Dom did n't even bother to glance up from pulling the fleshgrass over the grave . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther , beyond the Boss . That 's the face of Evening Crest , Ben , and there are n't any plainsmen there . You 're imagining things . " " Am not . " Benjamin thrust his lower jaw out in a gesture Tessa remembered her mother making while arguing with Perin . " It does n't matter , " Tessa said . " We have to get back to funeral camp before dark . " So they turned and left Sora there beneath the grass . The funeral ceremonies had been , in their own way , more strenuous than the climb to Topfield . First there had been the argument over which symbol of their mother 's would be included in the Wolholme family ward . Tessa had n't quite dared suggest a trilobite fossil from the collection , and had found Perin 's final , and inarguable , selection , Sora 's favorite pair of pruning shears , eerily correct , despite its inadequacy . Tessa had tried to pick a fight without telling Poppa what it was about , but he had not risen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck his thick Wolholme fingers partway through the fine handles and clumsily clicked the blades to show by the mismatch how well they had , in contrast , fit Sora 's hand . And after the attachment of the shears to the upper part of the ward , there had been the feast at long tables under the low-hanging  | branches of the family dilberry grove . All the families of Calrick Bend had sent representatives , even the most-high Dalhousies and Minishkins , some closer friends arriving with all generations . Tessa and her brothers had worked desperately to feed them all the spicysweet cakes that were always served at this event and no other . Dom claimed his butt had forgotten what a chair felt like . But their weariness was good , a prelude to relaxation , for the family would survive . Momma lay properly at Topfield , and the Wolholmes were back in their fields and groves . Now Tessa sat alone under those dilberries , right at the side of the ward , and tried to think things through . She mended clothing as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would task her for wasting time on thought if she seemed to be doing something useful . The ward was a tower of family symbols , and one stood beside each house , a sign of the family 's persistence . Some wards had bases of mysterious silvery metals brought from Earth , metals poor Koola could no longer make . And more than one ward rested on a vivid green-blue sphere representing that far-away planet , Mother of All . The Dalhousies , for example , had been big on Earth , and wished this known . For all Tessa knew , they had owned that planet and come to Koola only on holiday , to be stuck here by an unexpected change of interplanetary transport schedule . The oldest things Tessa could see in the high-tension ceramic matrix of the Wolholme ward 's base could not have been much more than a century old , more than two centuries younger than the initial settlements on Koola : an enamel portrait of a woman holding a child , a man 's bronzed sun hat , and another pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , Theresa . " Though heavy , Dalka could move quietly when she had a mind to . She sat down next to Tessa and dropped her bag . " Now we can get to business . " She paused , and frowned . " Why are you wasting so much thread on those rear buttons ? " " Benjamin catches them on trellises and rips them off . " Tessa was deliberately patient with Dalka 's interference even in trifles . She hoped Dalka noticed . " He likes to climb . " " We all do , when we 're young . Well , even when we 're not . At least that foolish city school Sora insisted on sending you to has n't ruined you completely for real life . " Tessa felt the power and oppression of village life settling over her like a weighted bird net . " Momma had good reasons for sending me there . If the Wolholmes are to survive ? " " If the Wolholmes are to survive , dear , you 're going to have to see to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Careful , Dalka . " To her surprise , Tessa found herself on the verge of losing her temper . She carefully folded Benjamin 's cover-alls . " Now , now . " Dalka chuckled . " I 'm not attacking poor Perin , darling . But you have more responsibilities than a lady should , and less help in carrying them out . " She pulled something from her bag and held it out to Tessa . " Recognize this ? " " People call them judeflowers . " Tessa looked at the bundled leaves and petals and remembered both her mother 's lessons and her botany class at Hammerswick , though reconciling the two was sometimes difficult . " It has a false stem that 's actually fused bracts . " She raised her eyebrows . " Goodness , what a clever child Sora raised . Do you know its uses ? " " No , Dalka , I do n't . " " Oh dear , do n't be so angry . " Dalka put the flowers back in her bag . " They serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We use them to grow an intestinal yeast for hiking the back country . An inoculation lasts maybe two-three weeks , residing in the ileum of the small intestine . Enough for a good overpass hike , if not to live permanently in the high plains . Lord knows how the high plainsmen do it . " She sighed . " There are real mysteries up there , girl . They 've done some first-rate enzyme work . " " Momma talked about that . . . but she never taught me . " " Of course not , dear . You were too young to appreciate the subtlety of it  --  and the subtlety 's everything and why men do n't fiddle with it . " Dalka put her arm around Tessa . " Humans would n't be able to live on Koola a day if it were n't for the tailored yeasts and bacteria we women produce in our little kitchen fermenters . It scares men , you know . Best thing about it , really . Tell them tailored bacteria , and they come up with stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurching down from the high burials to find the doors they were carried out of . " She shook her head in rueful amusement . " So they build special doors for corpses while we tighten the knots in the Web . " " The Web ? " Tessa found the catechism annoying . " The Web that keeps us from falling into the crevasses right under life on Koola . It 's supported us since time im-mem-morial . " Dalka lingered over the word as if it was a particularly delicious chocolate . She waved her arm , fat jiggling . " Take these dilberries , for example . " Tessa looked up at the purple oil-containing fruit dangling just above them .  | " If these trees were left alone , " Dalka said , " they 'd die out . Nothing fertilizes them naturally . But they 're held by the Web . Men distract little wasps into them by hanging tangleflowers all over the trees . A paltry male secret . Did you ever look at those flowers and wonder why they were there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all for love ! " Dalka barked a laugh . " Well , we 'll see next spring , wo n't we ? Then I bet you wo n't be sorry to be back from school . " Tessa saw no need to respond to the sally . Lush tangleflower blossoms cascading from the branches , their intoxicating scent filling the dilberry groves , were a symbol of romance . It was a commonplace that a girl , having made love to her first boy under the trees , returned home with her loose hair full of tangleflower petals . " Who invented it all , Dalka ? " Tessa kept her thoughts on the matter at hand . Dalka slowed for the first time . " It 's been done since time immem ? " You said that . " Tessa 's lessons at Hammerswick came to her rescue . " But the ancestors of dilberries are native to Koola , while the wasps are gene-modified and come from Tal-Tal-Monga , famous for its biological products . And the tangleflowers  --  no one knows . So who put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Web . " Dalka retreated into obscurity . " And Sora wished you to learn its secrets . " " Yes , Dalka . " Tessa started the next morning by hanging vegetables up to dry . The long dark-blue roots would , in a few weeks , taste like thick , greasy meat . No one in the upper Shield valleys favored the taste , but city dwellers on the edge of the Great Flats enjoyed it , for some reason . They were stupid enough to live down there in the thick air and so could not be expected to have sense about other things . With mindless meticulousness , she quartered the arm-long tubers and strung them on the rack . She would take a stroll about the kitchen garden whenever her arms got tired and look off across the farms to the other wall of the canyon . At that moment farming seemed so painful that it had obviously been ordained by God as punishment for unknown sins . She 'd brought books back from Hammerswick but had progressed little in reading them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Benjamin 's hand , cut on a trellis , or the filth that accumulated in the house as if delivered daily by some p 187 unusually dutiful service , or simply the countless varieties of plant that grew in the canyon to be harvested every month . She had been able to spend very little time with the upstairs fossil collection , its complex Koolan taxonomies worked out in Sora 's careful hand , and longed to find out more about this , her mother 's private fascination . There were times now when she saw the farms and fields of Calrick Bend for what they were : a microscopically thin overlay of human action over an alien and enigmatic planet . That did not make the tubers any lighter . After one turn about the garden she found Benjamin himself . He sat on the side stairs by the drying rack , paying diligent attention to the tension swivels on his dart rifle . He 'd pulled the webbing off and was deliberately tightening it , strand by strand . She sat down next to him . " Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look at her but bent his head to his task . " It 's something that 's got to be done . " Tessa looked at her younger brother 's curly-haired head . What made men so certain about things that were only guesses , presumptions , and dreams ? " There 's plenty that has to be done here . " He finally looked up at her , his dark eyes appraising . " I know that . One thing is that I 'm going to get that wapiti . The one , you remember , at Momma 's burial . That 's number one . Then me and Dom can get this family working again . " Tessa fought down the anger that came at this childish arrogance . " How is killing the wapiti going to help ? " " I 've been in the high valleys . It 's still up there . Something 's brought it down from the Boss . But I can find it . And kill it . " " That 's good , Benjamin . But right now you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked disgusted . " Come on . That 's your job . I have more important things to do . " " Like hunting wapiti . " " Like hunting wapiti . " His voice rose . " Like seeing that this family does n't just disappear . " " We wo n't disappear . But it takes work . We all have to work . " " Do n't talk to me like that ! " Benjamin was near tears . " You 're not Momma . You ca n't tell me what to do . You ca n't run this fam-ily Tessa felt her temper starting to fray . " I 'm not trying to run this family . " " Dom . Dom and I can run this family . We know what to do . We do n't need you messing into it . " This was too much . Before he could react , Tessa darted for-  | ward , seized him with a strength she had n't known she had , and hung him up by his belt on the drying rack . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can just hang up there with the rest of the vegetables until you dry out . " Completely forgetting his manly demeanor , Benjamin broke into tears . He wailed and kicked his legs . " What the hell is this ? " Dom strode past Tessa and regarded his brother . Benjamin choked down his sobs . Dom shook his head and pulled him off . Not looking at either of his siblings , Benjamin ran into the house , head down . " You forgot your dart rifle ! " Tessa shouted after him . Dom bent over and picked it up . He looked at her . Annoyance and amusement vied for control of his face . " Now , Tessa , what did you have to go and do that for ? Things are tough enough for him . His pride ? " " His pride ? " Tessa was outraged . " What about mine ? " " He 's only thirteen . " " Time for him to start learning about what 's important . " They stared at each other . " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to get done . " He walked slowly away , dart rifle under his arm . Kevin ran out of the house . " Ben 's crying ! " His earnest face demanded more information . " Yes , Kevin . He 's very upset . " This seemed sufficient explanation . Kevin reached into the bin and wrestled out a tuber as long as he was . " Can I help ? " It slithered in his arms as if alive . He stumbled around trying to subdue it , his face a mask of grim resolve . Tessa turned away , using every ounce of determination to keep from laughing . Pride was nothing to be trifled with . " We all climb up here , " Dalka said , breath wheezing dangerously as she labored up the trail . " But each of us seeks something dif-ferent . " She pulled herself up onto a rock ledge , grunting . Below her was a hundred-meter drop . She sat down to dangle her feet over the edge and pulled out her pipe . On a planet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was free . " Men hunt , " Tessa said , sitting down next to her . " They do . To no good purpose , in protein/energy balance terms . " Dalka puffed the pipe to light . " The time would be more usefully spent planting another crop . " " I do n't think they see it in protein/energy balance terms . " " That 's why they need us , dear . " Above their ledge was a slope made up of large toppled rock slabs . Dalka gestured at it . " We come  | up here for necessaries , not silly animals . The air 's right up here for the proper lichens . They should be on the shaded sides of those rocks . " The air was thin and cold , shrugging off any influence of human beings . It was a high Shield air , dry and unforgiving . Tessa took the dry feeling in her nostrils as a benison . They had been climbing all morning , floating up the tilted cliff side , to this specific hanging alcove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cooperset Canyon was now invisible behind cliffs and towers of rock . Tessa climbed partway up the rock fall and searched shadowed cracks for the particular silver-blue lichen Dalka wanted . Its paracrinelike secretions were specific and rare , essential to Dalka 's enzyme operations . Was this really how she wanted to spend her rare days free of farm work ? Tessa sighed , carefully inaudible . " We do have to watch out for them , of course . " Dalka 's tenor voice carried easily on the breeze . " They know these high valleys , of course , as well as we do . Better , maybe , because they run around so much , chasing their beasts . " She made the admission grudgingly . " But they still get lost , and since they 're convinced that they do n't get lost , they 're hard to find . You 'll find an occasional dried-up body in a crevasse  --  the bad end of an unsuccessful hunting trip . No telling how old they are . " Tessa paused and peered down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight from beneath the rock ? No , no , it was just a couple of dried twigs . She squinted at it one last time and went back to work . A patch of the necessary lichen covered the top lip of a particularly precarious rock . " So how do you watch out for them ? " she asked , after a moment . Dalka did not reply immediately , but sent up an exceptionally large puff of smoke , as if to remind Tessa where she was . Tessa chimneyed up to the lichen and hung there as she scraped at it . It smelled bitter and dusty . From her precarious perch she could see the shattered teeth of Ariel 's , Fulda 's , Top Hat , and Angel 's Buttes , blue with distance . To the right , visible only as a succession of ever-hazier ranges , was the height of the Boss , the Plateau hidden behind it . A sand hawk flew overhead , catching a thermal from the open area at the base of Caspar 's Lith . Tessa paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing she liked better than walking the high cliffs , when she had a chance . Dalka did too , puffing and wheezing her way formidably up the slopes , so they made natural companions . " A number of ways , " Dalka said finally . Another pause . " Most they do n't know about . " " Oh , Dalka , " Tessa said , exasperated . " I 'm not going to tell . "  | " I 'm sure you wo n't , dear . Even under the soft blossoms of the tangleflowers . " " When the time for that comes , I 'm sure I 'll have other things to talk about . " Dalka laughed explosively . " Fair enough , child . And secrets cease to be anything if no one knows them . Well . . . my favorite is a simple one . Do you clean your brothers ' boots ? " " Only Kevin 's . He 's young and they 're really tiny , so it 's fun . The others stay dirty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra work , nothing for a woman . There 's a leather polish , an emollient and binder complex , that works well . As a side effect , the boots then leave traces on the rocks . A few simple enzyme reactions and you can track any given pair of boots , if you have a sensitive nose . " She chortled . " And the men think you 're doing it so their feet will be clean-shod . " Tessa smiled despite herself . She was starting to think that she might enjoy being as sly as Dalka . She thought about her brothers , and the wapiti , and their male secrets . " Can you show me ? " Dalka smoked thoughtfully while Tessa finished collecting the lichen . " Certainly . It 's a set of reactions useful for other purposes as well , so we are n't even being frivolous . " They cooked dinner over a portable heater and rolled out their sleeping bags right near the cliff 's edge . Mountains disappeared one by one into the darkness . The rasp of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tessa said as she lay in her bag staring up at the starfilled sky . " What was my mother looking for ? " " You mean , with all those ancient bugs of hers ? Ancestors , I think . " " Ancestors ? " " Of course . We all need them . Look at these wards families spend so much time on . They seek roots to support their branches . Sora just decided that her roots lay here , on Koola , and not anywhere else in the universe . She spent her time trying to understand those roots . It made no sense to me , mind , but that was her business . " " I was born on Koola , " Tessa said . " That you were , child . Go to sleep . " Before Tessa knew it , it was morning , and time to climb back down into the canyon to resume her labors . Tessa awoke in darkness . She did n't move or thrash around but tried to figure out why she was awake . She lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of moonlight came through the window . A shadowy figure loomed . p 191 " Tessa ! " Dom hissed . " Wake up . " " I 'm awake . Why ? " " It 's that idiot , Benjamin . He 's gone off . " " Get clear , Dom . " " He thinks he 's found the trail of that damn wapiti . " Dom was disgusted . " He 's been fascinated by it since Momma 's funeral . " " I know . He 's not been too clear on why . " " He wants to kill it . It will redeem our family . " " Does n't he know that does n't make any sense ? " Tessa said . " Never mind that ! We have to get him . Now . This is a goddam embarrassment . " Tessa got out of bed and dressed herself . After a moment 's hesitation she grabbed her small bag of chemicals and reagents , wondering if , in future years , it would grow to the size of Dalka 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for them below . " Where are you going ? " he cried . " Shh , Kevin , " Tessa said . " You 'll wake Poppa . " " Where are you going ? " His voice was the barest whisper , carefully enunciated . " Benjamin  --  gotten lost  --  night  --  we have to find him  --  you take care of Poppa . " Dom and Tessa interrupted each other in their whispered description . Kevin listened gravely , then lifted his arm in a farewell salute . " Good luck . Should I make pancakes for when you get back ? " " No , " Tessa said . " You 'll just make a mess . " Kevin pouted . " You never give me any credit . " He sat down on the floor and started playing with the blocks Perin had made for him . There was n't time to convince him to go back to bed . " His usual hunting trek is up Pong 's Defile , over Torfoot Jumble , and up into Born or Oak , " Dom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing we can do is start there . " Both Koola 's moons had risen and gave a clear light . " Good luck that the moons are out , " Tessa said as they clambered over the rocks of Torfoot Jumble . " If you think about it , little sister , you 'll realize that that 's the reason he chose tonight to go wapiti hunting . " " Oh . " Dom slowed , and stopped at the splitting point of Born and Oak Canyons . There was no sign of which way Benjamin had gone , if he had indeed come this way at all . Dom sighed and was clearly about to pick a direction at random . Her brother was a careful man , Tessa knew , and that necessity must have been driving him crazy . Tessa shifted her weight uncomfortably . " Can you wait a minute ? I 'll be right back . "  | " Sure . " Dom sat down on a rock and stared morosely at the forking canyons ahead . Tessa wandered off among the rocks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were three or four easy ways up to the two canyons , and Benjamin would certainly have taken the route of least resistance . His boots , cleaned and oiled diligently by Tessa to Dalka 's instructions , would have left distinct traces on the rocks . So Tessa walked , stumbling over unseen obstructions , and searched out the trails that had led up this way since  --  she grimaced ? time immemorial . At every likely spot she sprayed a bit of the enzyme complex Dalka had given her . On her sixth try she smelled the sharp stink of the reaction . Benjamin had gone up Born Canyon . But there was no visible trace of Benjamin 's passing . She was n't about to explain the whole enzyme business to Dom , so she needed a better reason for deciding that this was the right direction . A few minutes of search up and down the trail rewarded her : just the trace of Benjamin 's boot tread in a patch of sand . " Dom ! " she shouted . " Here ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperceptible boot print . " Good job , Tessa , " he said , finally . He scanned his eyes slowly up the trail , and pointed out something Tessa had not seen , a twig broken by Benjamin 's climb over a rock fall . " Let 's go . " " It was a lucky find , " Tessa said . " I was just ? " " I said good job and I meant it . Do n't waste energy worrying about my pride . Let 's go . " Tessa followed , slightly ashamed of herself . They crossed a spur and Tessa saw a glow in the distance . Dawn ? No  --  it was early for that yet . The light source rose out of the rocks , far away , visible through a crack in the canyon wall beyond . Suddenly , she realized what it was : the lights of Perala . Where the Hammerswick Academy still was , most of its students virtuously asleep except for those who were even more virtuously up studying . She remembered her time there , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing through the dark mountains with one crazy intent brother in pursuit of a second . Perala looked so close , as if she could reach out , grab the top of Rock Bastion , which guarded it 's upstream approach , and pull herself there to drop into her old bed in the dorm . Dom was already far ahead of her . She hurried in pursuit . Dawn seemed to grow out of the earth itself , slowly defining the bulk of rocks in shades of dark blue . Dom and Tessa found  | themselves moving more quickly and surely before they realized why . Dom 's quick hunter 's eye had found several more traces of Benjamin 's passing . The box canyon they climbed narrowed to a crack and grew steeper . A cold wind blew through it from somewhere high above . Tessa fancied she could smell the fresh grasses of the Plateau . Perhaps they would find the high plainsmen if they kept climbing . " He 's a young idiot . " Dom had been improvising variations on this theme since they started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They clambered out of the crack and over a crumbling ridge . A narrow canyon lay ahead of them . Dom pointed . " There . " Benjamin was a tiny dot on the opposite slope , moving slowly , like someone tired and unsure of what he was doing . He disappeared over the top and they slid down the talus to the bottom of the canyon , sight of their quarry giving their legs new strength . When they reached the top of the next ridge , Benjamin turned and saw them standing high above him . He stopped dead for a moment , as if not believing they were there , then started to run . " An especial kind of idiot . He 's going to hurt himself . " Dom had barely spoken before a rock turned under Benjamin 's foot and he vanished from their view . He did n't make a sound . " Damn it ! " Dom pointed to the right . " You go this way . I 'll slide this way . Damn him for a fool . " Tessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face covered with agonized sweat , but he still struggled up the next slope , whining like an injured animal . He wailed and tried desperately to bring his dart rifle to bear on something ahead of him . Tessa looked up . Looming over them , as it had at Momma 's funeral , was a Great Wapiti . It stared down at them , curved horns sharp against the cloudless sky . Benjamin whimpered and lowered his weapon . He could not fire it with only one arm . The wapiti waited majestically for a moment , as if to see the outcome of Benjamin 's struggle , then bounded over a rock and was gone . " Damn you ! Damn you ! " Benjamin sobbed in great heaves . " It 's all your fault . You lost him for me . If it was n't for you . . . oh , damn you ! " " Benjamin  --  we were just trying to find you . It 's all right . It 's all right . Let 's take care of this arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be comforted , and sobbed all the louder . It was finally too much for her . " Oh , for God 's sake , Ben , stop being such a big baby . You 're being absolutely ridiculous . " Dom slid down the slope . Saying nothing , he matter-of-factly  | took care of Benjamin 's arm with an inflatable splint from his emergency kit . He sat his brother up against a rock and looked at him . Benjamin looked back , trying to control his tears . " Do n't worry , Ben . " Dom 's voice was soothing . " It 's not a failure because you tried as hard as you could . It 's almost impossible to track a wapiti . It 's amazing you did what you did . " Benjamin 's face was transformed with pride . He looked challengingly at Tessa , closing ranks with his brother against the female interloper . Tessa felt rage , and disappointment . After that long companionable climb up the canyons , Dom had turned against her , as she had all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for acting like a self-important idiot , " Dom continued , not raising his voice . " To go off without warning in the middle of the night . . . Tessa and I had to track you all the way up here . It was a self-centered , stupid , arrogant , inconsiderate thing to do , and if you ever try it again I 'll use you to fertilize the melon vines . " Benjamin 's face went slack at this transformation of his brother from ally to scold . Tessa stepped away to give them privacy while Dom chewed Benjamin out and to keep herself from putting in her bit , which she desperately wanted to do . That would be too much . Pride , after all , was at stake . Then she saw it . Projecting from the rubble at the cliff 's base was the snout of a huge fossil trilobite . It gleamed in the sun , for it seemed to be made entirely of iron pyrite . " Dom ! " she said , feeling an excitement she could not entirely explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , without further bidding , began to dig the rubble away from it so that they could see it better . She joined him . As they dug , the sun rose and filled the high canyon . After a while , lacking any more productive activity , Benjamin came and lent the assistance of his one good arm . The fossil had been freed from its matrix by a recent rockslide . The rubble covering it was loose . In an hour the entire thing was revealed , glittering like a spacecraft from another star . It was a perfectly preserved specimen , almost as large as the ones guarding the approach to Topfield . Dom touched it , feeling the precise lines of its carapace . " That was pretty silly . " His forehead was beaded with sweat . " Am I helping you continue Momma 's fossil collection ? What are we supposed to do with it now ? " " We carry it down . " Tessa was calmly certain . Dom laughed . " Are you out of your mind , dear little sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the size of it . "  | Tessa did and finally saw it , not as a mystic symbol , her link to her mother and , through her mother , to the planet itself , but as a giant hunk of iron ore . She let out a sigh . Bringing it home would have been just the right closure for Sora 's departure from their family , something brought back from the heights just as Momma had been carried up and left . It would have made things seem to make sense . She felt bitter disappointment . Benjamin plucked at its edge . " It seems to be loose here . " " You 're delirious , " Dom said . " It 's the pain killers . Let 's stop wasting our time and head home . There 's work to do . " " Dom , will you look at it ? " Benjamin was exasperated . " Just for a second . " Dom did so . He frowned , then put both hands under the edge and heaved . The muscles stood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so easily that he almost stumbled . The pyrite carapace was hollow . He peered underneath , as if fearing something concealed . " How did this happen ? " Tessa sat down , feeling light-headed . " I bet that after this trilobite died , scavengers ate out the innards . Only the hard shell was left to be replaced by the pyrite inclusion . It 's like a giant 's shield . Can we try to pick it up ? " The three of them hefted it . There were enough spikes and protrusions that it was easy to hold on to . It was still heavy , but perfectly possible to carry . She looked at her brothers . " Will you help me ? " " Yes , " Benjamin said , eager to make peace . " Come on , " Dom said . " We wo n't be able to carry it down at once . Do n't you remember how long it took to get up here ? " " This can be a project , " Tessa said . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Try two years , " Dom said . He was closer to being right . When they returned home that day , the sun already setting , Perin was desperately worried , having been unable to understand Kevin 's garbled explanations . Kevin had dedicated himself , meticulously and with great concentration , to setting things up for pancakes . They all sat down to eat them , though it was time for dinner . " There 's a real art to pancakes , " Kevin pronounced , burning every one . After dinner , Tessa went upstairs and closed herself into Sora 's study . Racks of fossils from all of Koola 's geologic eras stood around her . Sora 's paleontological notebook still lay open to the last entry , a comparison of two amphibian skeletons from different periods . The golden trilobite , of course , would never fit in here , and that  | was not what she intended . She wanted it as the base of the Wolholme family ward . If other families thought they grew out of a distant , mythical blue-green world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Sora had long ago realized , were creatures of Koola . It was right that they should show it . If Tessa mentioned it now , the rest of the family would hoot at her , and refuse to help . By the time they dragged the thing , inch by sweaty inch , down to Calrick Bend , she thought they would feel differently . Tessa lay down on the floor , her head on a chunk of rock dense with ancient ferns , and went to sleep . THE EL STATION platform was empty , and the winter Chicago Sunday afternoon had turned into night . Stanley Paterson paused at the turnstile and rubbed his nose doubtfully . The overhead lamps cast circular pools of light on the gouged surface of the platform , but this made Stanley feel obvious , rather than safe . He hunched his shoulders inside his wool topcoat , puffed out his cheeks , and shuffled along the platform , looking down the tracks in the direction of the expected train . His mind was still full of the financial affairs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a big project , worth working weekends for , so aside from the inside of his condominium , the inside of his office , and the inside of various El trains , he no longer knew what anything looked like . Winter had somehow arrived without an intervening autumn . He 'd been to Oak Street Beach once , near the end of the summer , he remembered . Or had that been last year ? The wind blew dried leaves past him ; delicately curved , ribbed , and textured leaves . He felt himself among them , heavy and gross , and thought about going on a diet . It was tough when you worked as hard as he did , he thought , excusing himself . It was hell on your eating habits . Today he 'd eaten  --  what ? He could n't remember . The coat slapped his legs . The skin by his nose was oily , there was an itch under his right shoulder blade , and he was hungry . He wondered what he could put in the microwave when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezer ? Chinese ? Chicken Kiev ? Hell , he 'd see when he got there . High above him floated the lighted windows of the city , rank upon rank , like cherubim . The turnstile clattered . Stanley tried to tell himself that it was ridiculous to feel afraid , even in the dark , alone on the platform , but succeeded only in feeling afraid and ridiculous , both . He leaned forward , looking again for the train , trying to pull it into the sta-  | tion by the force of his gaze , but the tracks remained empty . He glanced toward the turnstile . A man stood there , a shadow . He was n't a big man and his race was not obvious , but he wore a hat , which looked like leather . Respectable people did not wear hats , Stanley felt . Particularly not leather ones . It looked too silly . The man turned and , with slow confident steps , walked toward Stanley . Stanley thought about running , but did n't . It would have made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels , hands in his pockets , and ignored the other . He tried to project an air of quiet authority . The platform on the other side of the tracks was completely empty . He never saw it , but he felt the knife press , sharp , against his side , just above the right kidney . There was no doubt whatsoever about what it was . " Your money . " " Excuse me ? I ? " " Your money . " The knife cut through the expensive fabric of his coat and grazed his flesh . Stanley felt a surge of annoyance at the wanton damage . Spontaneously , unthinkingly , like a tripped mousetrap , Stanley cried out and hit the man in the face with a balled fist , remembering only at the last second not to put his thumb inside his fingers . It was like striking out in sleep , but he did not awaken , as he usually did , sweat-soaked and tangled in sheets . Instead , the dark cold night remained around him , and as the man stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands around his throat . He really was a small man , much smaller than he had expected , and he could n't remember why he had been so frightened of him . The knife blade twisted , and Stanley felt it penetrate flesh . A scream cut the night . There was suddenly a warm glow in Stanley 's belly , which spread up through his chest . He felt dizzy , and flung his suddenly weightless assailant across the platform , seeing him whirl tiny , tiny away , joining the leaves in their dance , then vanishing back through the turnstile , which clattered again . Blackness loomed overhead like a tidal wave and blotted out the lights of the windows . The dark heaviness knocked Stanley down onto the platform , and he heard a wailing sound , like sirens , or a baby crying . He rested on the platform , which had become as soft as a woman 's breast . It was late , he was tired , and the train did not seem to want to come , so he decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had come in to check Margaret 's p 203 pulse but found , when she pulled back the blankets , that her patient had turned into a mass of giant black bats that burst up from t he rumpled sheets to fill the bedroom with the fleshy beating of their wings , became the shrill ring of the telephone . Matthew Harmon woke up with a shock , jerked the cord until the phone fell on the bed , and cradled the receiver under his ear . " Dr. Harmon , " the voice on the phone said . A simple , flat statement , as if someone had decided to call in the middle of the night to wake him up and reassure him about his identity . Harmon felt a surge of irritation , and knew he was once again alive . He reached up and turned on the bedside lamp , which cast a pool of light over the bed . He did not look at the other half of the bed , but he could hear Margaret 's labored breathing . She muttered something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked , as if having a heart seizure . " There were no bats , at least . " Yes ? " he said . " What is it ? " His throat hurt again , and his voice was husky . A pause . " I was asked to make this call . Against my better judgment . . . it 's information I do n't think you should have . But , " a deep sigh , " it seems that we have one of what you call ... abandoned souls . That is what you call them , is n't it ? " Another pause , longer than the first . " This is stupid . I wonder why I called you . " " That makes two of us . " The voice on the line was contemptuous , but uncomfortably so , ill at ease despite its advantage of identity and wakefulness . It was a familiar voice , from somewhere in the past , one of so many familiar voices , voices of medical students , interns , residents , nurses , fellow doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some respectful , some exasperated , some angry . He ran his hand over his scalp and thought about that tone of defensive contempt . " Orphaned . Not abandoned . Though that will do just as well . " Given the subject of the call , it had to be someone at an Intensive Care Unit , probably at a city hospital . Possibly connected with a trauma center . That narrowed things . . . got it . " Masterman , " he said . " Eugene Colin Masterman . Johns Hopkins Medical School , class of seventy-five . You 're at Pres St. Luke 's now . I hope that you are finally clear on the difference between afferent and efferent nerves . I remember you had trouble with the distinction , back in my neuroanatomy class at Hopkins . Just remember : SAME , sensory afferent , motor efferent . It 's not hard . But , as you said , you did n't decide to call me . Leibig , chief of your ICU , told you to . How is Karl ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aside from the inevitable effects of age . He has a renal dysfunction , and seems to  | have developed a vestibular disorder which keeps him off his feet . He will be retiring next year . " " A pity , " Harmon said . " A good man . And three years younger than I am , as I 'm sure I do n't have to remind you . Well , Eugene , why do n't you tell me the story ? " Masterman , he recalled , hated being called Eugene . Masterman gave it to him , chapter and verse , in offensively superfluous detail . Patient 's name : Paterson , Stanley Andrew . Patient 's social security number . Patient 's place of employment , a management consulting firm in the Loop . Locations of stab wounds , fractures , lacerations . Patient 's blood type and rejection spectrum . Units of blood transfused , in the ambulance , in the Emergency Room , in the ICU , divided into whole blood and plasma . Names of the ambulance crew . Name of admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then first name and middle initial . " Who was his first-grade teacher ? " Harmon said . " What  --  Dr. Harmon , I did not want to make this call , understand that . I did so at the specific request of Dr. Leibig . " " Who also wonders if I am crazy . But he did it for old time 's sake , bless him . Eugene , if , as it seems , you are not enjoying this call , perhaps you should make an effort to be more . . . pithy . " " Paterson suffered a cardiac arrest at , let 's see , one-oh-eight A.M. We attempted to restart several times with a defibrillator , but were finally forced to open the chest and apply a pacemaker . We have also attached a ventilator . His condition is now stable . " " Life is not stable , " Harmon said , but thought , " the stupid bastards . " Would they never learn ? Did n't they understand the consequences ? Doctors . Clever technicians who thought themselves scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Minimal , Eugene ? Where did he die ? " " He is n't dead . We have him on life support . " " Do n't play games with me ! Where was he murdered ? " " At the Adams Street El station , at Adams and Wabash . The northbound platform . " He paused , then the words spilled out . " Listen , Harmon , you ca n't go on doing this , talking about ghosts and goblins and all sorts of idiocy about the spirits of the unburied dead . This is n't the Middle Ages , for crissakes . We 're doctors , we know better , we 've learned . We know how things work now . Have you forgotten everything ? You ca n't just let people under your care die to protect their souls . That 's crazy , absolute lunacy . I do n't know how I let Leibig talk me into this , he knows you 're crazy too , and p 205 the patient 's not dead , he 's alive , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and I wo n't pull the plug because of some idiotic theory you have about ghosts . And I do so know the difference between afferent and efferent . Afferent nerves ? " " Never mind , Dr. Masterman , " Harmon said wearily . " At this hour , I 'm not sure I remember myself . Get back to your patients . Thank you for your call . " He hung the receiver up gently . After a moment to gather his strength , he pulled his legs out from under the comforter and forced them down to the cold floor . As they had grown thinner , the hair on them , now white , seemed to have grown thicker . He pulled the silk pajamas down so that he could not see his shins . The virtues of youth , he thought , too often become the sins of age . He had once been slim , and was now skinny . His nose , once aquiline , was a beak , and his high noble forehead had extended itself clear over the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Margaret , as she had been . He remembered her , before their marriage , as a young redhead in a no-nonsense gray suit with a ridiculous floppy bow tie , and later , in one of his shirts , much too long for her and tight in the chest , as she raised her arms in mock dismay at the number of his books she was expected to fit into their tiny apartment , and finally , as a prematurely old woman gasping her life out in the bed next to him . None of it had been her fault , but it had been she who had suffered . He dialed the phone . It was answered on the first ring . " Sphinx and Eye of Truth Bookstore , Dexter Warhoff , Owner and Sole Proprietor . We 're closed now , really , but we open at ? " " Dexter , " Harmon said . " Sorry to bother you . It looks like we have another one . " " Professor ! " Dexter said with delight . " No bother at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kabbalah . Kind of fun , but nothing that wo n't wait . Where is this one ? Oh , never mind , let it be a surprise . Usual place , in an hour ? I 'll call him and get him ready . Oh , boy . " Harmon restrained a sigh . He could picture Dexter , plump and bulging in a shirt of plum or burgundy , with his bright blue eyes and greasy hair , behind the front desk at the Sphinx and Eye of Truth Bookstore , where he spent most of his waking hours , of which he apparently had many , scribbling in a paperback copy of The Prophecies of Nostradamus with a pencil stub or , as tonight , rearranging Hebrew letters to make anagrams of the Name of God . The store itself was a neat little place on the Near North Side , with colorful throw pillows on the floor and the scent of jasmine p 206 incense in the air . It carried books on every imaginable topic relating to the occult and the supernatural , from Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loch Ness Monster , from Tarot cards to ESP . It had been almost impossible for Harmon to go there , but go there he did , finally , after exhausting every other resource , to accept a cup of camomile tea from Dexter 's dirtyfingernailed hands and learn what he reluctantly came to understand to be the truth . " Yes , Dexter . St. Mary 's , as usual . " " Right . See ya . " Harmon hung up . He 'd searched and searched , down every avenue , but he was well and truly stuck . When it came to the precise and ticklish business of the exorcism and binding of the spirits of the uneasy dead , there was no better assistant alive than Dexter Warhoff . A train finally pulled into the station . It was lit up golden from inside , like a lantern . The doors slid open , puffing warm air . Stanley thought about getting up and going into the train . He could get home that way . But he remembered how uncomfortable the seats were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the station to his condo , so he just remained where he was , where the ground was soft and warm . After waiting for a long moment , the train shut its doors and whooshed off , up along the shining metal tracks as they arched into the sky , to vanish among the stars and the windows of the apartment buildings , which now floated free in the darkness , like balloons let loose by children . Once he was alone again , Stanley found himself standing , not knowing how he had come to be so . The wind from Lake Michigan had cleared the sky , and a half moon lit the towers of the city . The city was alive ; he could hear the soughing of its breath , the thrumming of its heart , and the murmuration of its countless vessels . Without thinking about it , he swung over the railing and slid down the girders of the El station to the waiting earth . The city spread out before him , Stanley Paterson ambled abroad . After some time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cumin and garlic . He turned into it , like a salmon swimming upstream , and soon stood among the cracked plaster columns and fishing nets of a Greek restaurant . A blue flame burst up in the dimness , and Stanley moved toward it . A waiter in a white sailor 's shirt served a man and a woman saganaki , fried kasseri cheese flamed with brandy . Stanley could taste the tartness of the cheese and the tang of p 207 the brandy as they both ate , and feel the crunch of the outside and the yielding softness of the inside . He could taste the wine too , the bitterly resinous heaviness of retsina . They looked at each other . She was young , wearing a cotton dress with a bold colorful pattern , and made a face at the taste of the wine . The man , who had ordered it , was older , in gray tweed , and grinned back at her . Stanley hovered over the two of them like a freezing man over a fire . As he drew close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been friends for a long time , at the law office where they both worked , but this was their first romantic evening together . She had finally made the suggestion , and now , as she looked at him , instead of thoughts of romance , her mind wandered to the coy calculations already becoming old to her , of getting to his apartment , giggling , of excusing herself at just the right moment to insert her diaphragm , of her mock exuberant gesture of tossing her panties over the foot of the bed at the moment he finally succeeded in getting her completely undressed , of how to act innocent while letting him know that she was n't . The older man 's shoulders stiffened , and he wished , too late , that he had resisted her , resisted the urge to turn her from a friend into yet another prematurely sophisticated young woman , wished that he could stop for a moment to think and breathe , in the midst of his headlong pursuit of the Other . The saganaki grew cold as they examined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above their heads . Stanley moved back , and found himself on the street again . Music came to him from somewhere far above . He slid up the smooth walls of an apartment building until he reached it . The glass of the window pushed against his face like the yielding surface of a soap bubble , and then , suddenly , he was inside . A woman with a mass of curly gray hair and an improbably long neck sat at the grand piano , her head cocked at the sheet music as she played , while a younger woman with lustrous black hair and kohl-darkened eyes sat straight-backed on a stool and held an oboe . The music , Stanley knew , though he had never heard it before , was Schumann 's Romances for Oboe and Piano , and they played it with the ease of long mutual familiarity . Their only audience was a fuzzy cat of uncertain breed that sat on a footstool and stared into the flames in the fireplace . Stanley felt the notes dance through him and sensed the blissful self-forgetfulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moved to join them . The oboist suddenly thought about the fact that , no matter how well she played and how much she  | practiced , she would never play well enough to perform with the Chicago Symphony , or any orchestra , ever , and the love of her life would always remain a hobby , a pastime . The pianist 's throat constricted , and suddenly she feared the complexity of the instrument before her , knowing that she was inadequate to the task , as she was to all tasks of any importance , that no one would ever approve of her , and that she was old . The instruments went completely out of sync , as if the performers were in separate rooms with soundproof walls between them , and the music crashed into cacophony . The cat stood up , bristling , stared right at Stanley , and hissed . The pianist tapped one note over and over with her forefinger . The oboist started to cut another reed , even though she had two already cut . Stanley passed back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered the streets of threestory brownstone apartment buildings . He felt warm soapy water on his skin , and drifted through the wide crack under an ill-fitting door . The bathroom was warm and steamy , heated by the glow of a gas burner in one wall . A plump woman in a flower-print dress , with short dark hair , washed a child in that most marvelous of bathing devices , a large freestanding claw-foot bathtub . The little girl in the tub had just had her hair washed , and it was slicked to her head like a mannikin 's . She stared intently down into the soapy water like a cat catching fish . " Point to your mouth , Sally . Your mouth . " Sally obediently put her finger in her mouth . " Point to your nose . " She put her finger in her nose . " Very good , Sally . Can you point to your ear ? Your ear , Sally . " After a moment 's thought , the little girl put her finger in her ear . " Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having decided which she liked best , stuck her finger back up her nose and stared at her mother . Her mother laughed , delighted at this mutiny . " Silly goose . " She poured water over the girl 's head . Sally closed her eyes and made a " brrr " noise with her lips . " Time to get out , Sally . " The little girl stood up , and her mother pulled the plug . Sally waved as the water and soap bubbles swirled down the drain and said , " Ba-bye . Ba-bye . " Her mother pulled her from the tub and wrapped her in a huge towel , in which she vanished completely . The feel of the terry cloth on his skin and the warm strawberry scent of the mother covered Stanley like a benediction . He stretched forward as the mother rubbed her daughter 's hair with the towel until it stood out in all directions . The mother 's happiness vanished , and she felt herself trapped , compelled , every moment of her life now given over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , no time to even think about getting any work done on the one poem she 'd been working on since she left high school to get married , her life predetermined now until she grew old and was left alone . She rubbed too vigorously with the towel , and Sally , smothered and manipulated by forces she could not control , or even understand , began to shriek . " Quiet , Sally . Quiet , damn it . " Stanley remembered the platform . What was he doing in here ? He had a train to catch , he had to get home . He could not even imagine how he had managed to stray . He turned and hurried off to the El station . The two of them walked down the street together , Harmon with a long measured stride , and Dexter with the peculiar mincing waddle he was compelled to use because of the width of his thighs . Harmon wore a thick knee-length overcoat and a karakul hat , but the cold still struck deep into his bones . He wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sensitive . He remembered a time , surely not that long ago , when he had enjoyed the winter , when it had made him feel alive . He and Margaret had spent weekends in Wisconsin , cross-country skiing , and making grotesque snowmen . No longer . Dexter wore a red windbreaker that made him look like a tomato , and a Minnesota Vikings cap with horns on it . As he walked , he juggled little beanbags in an elaborate fountain . He had a number of similar skills  --  such as rolling a silver dollar across the back of his knuckles , like George Raft , and making origami animals  --  all of which annoyed Harmon because he had never learned to do things like that . He thought about the image the two of them presented , and snorted , amused at himself for feeling embarrassed . " Father Toomey looked a little bummed out , " Dexter said . " I think we woke him up . " " Dexter , it 's three-thirty in the morning . Not everyone sits up all night reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . Anyway , he cheered up after we talked about the horoscope reading I 'm doing for him . There 's a lot of real interesting stuff in it . " " An ordained Catholic priest is having you do his horoscope ? " Dexter looked surprised . " Sure . Why not ? " Why not , indeed ? Harmon hefted his ancient black leather bag . The instruments it contained had been blessed by Father Toomey and sprinkled with holy water from the font at St. Mary 's . Harmon , in the precisely rigorous theological way that devout atheists have , doubted the efficacy of a blessing from a priest so far sunk in  | superstition that he had his horoscope done , and performed holy offices for a purpose so blatantly demonic , but he had to admit that it always seemed to do the job . When he handed the sleepy , slightly inebriated priest the speculum , the wand , the silver nails , the censer , the compass , and the rest of the instruments of his new trade , they were nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands after the blessing , they vibrated with suppressed energy . The touch of such half-living things was odious to him , essential though they were . It disturbed him that such things worked . As quickly as he could , he wrapped them in their coverings of virgin lamb hide , inscribed with Latin prayers and Babylonian symbols , and placed them , in correct order , into his bag . That bag had once held his stethoscope , patella reflex hammer , thermometer , hypodermics , laryngoscope , and the rest of his medical instruments , and though he had not touched any of them in years , it had pained him to remove them so that the bag could be used for its new purpose . " You know , Professor , the other day I was reading an interesting book about the gods of ancient Atlantis ? " " Oh , Dexter , " Harmon said irritably . " You do n't really believe all these things , do you ? " Dexter grinned at him , yellow-toothed . " Why not ? You believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanswerable argument . " I believe in them , Dexter , only because I am forced to , not because I like it . That 's the difference between us . It would be terrible to like the idea that ghosts exist . " " Boy , did you fight it , " Dexter said with a chuckle . " You sat with me for an hour , talking about Mary Baker Eddy . Then you shut up . I asked you what was wrong . A ghost , ' you said . I 've got to get rid of a ghost . ' Took you three cups of tea to say that . You do n't even like camomile tea , do you ? " " It served . " " It sure did . You remember that first time , do n't you ? I 'll never forget it . We hardly knew what we were doing , like two kids playing with dynamite . I had pretended I knew more about it than I did , you know . " " I know . " They often talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . " I thought I could handle it , but it almost swallowed me and you had to save my ass . Quite a talent you have there . Strongest I 've ever heard of . You should be proud . " " I feel precisely as proud as I would if I discovered that I had an innate genius for chicken stealing . " DEATHBINDER 211 ,  | Dexter laughed , head thrown back . He had a lot of fillings in his back teeth . " Gee , that 's pretty funny . But anyway , this Kabbalah stuff is real interesting .... " Harmon suffered himself to be subjected to a rambling , overly detailed lecture on medieval Jewish mysticism until , much too soon , they were at the El station . Dexter craned his head back and looked up at the dark girders of the station , his face suddenly serious . " I feel him up there . He 's a heavy one . Strong . He did n't live enough , when he had the chance . Those are always the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . . . wait . They lock these things when the trains stop running , and we 're not exactly authorized . " He reached into his pocket and pulled out a little black pouch , which , when opened , revealed a line of shiny lock-picking tools . " I used to pick locks at school , " Dexter said . " Just for fun . I never stole anything . Figuring out the locks was the good part . Schools do n't have very good locks . Most students just break in the win-dows . " He walked up to the heavy metal mesh door at the base of the stairs and had it opened about as quickly as he could have with a key . He sighed , disappointed . " The CTA does n't either . I do n't even know why they bother . Well , now it 's time . Good luck . " They paused and he shook Harmon 's hand , as he always did , with a simple solemnity . Nothing to say , Harmon turned and started up toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people who want to live forever are always the ones who ca n't find anything to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon , " as Dr. Kaltenbrunner , the head of Radiology at Mount Tabor Hospital , had once said . Dr. K was never bored , and certainly never boring , enjoyed seventeenth-century English poetry , and died of an aneurism three months before Harmon encountered his first ghost . Died and stayed dead . Harmon always thought he could have used his help . Thomas Browne and John Donne would have understood ghosts better than Harmon could , which was funny , because there had n't been enough ghosts in the seventeenth century to be worth worrying about . Some doctors managed to stay away from ER duty , and it was mostly the young ones ? who needed to be taught , by having their noses rubbed in it , about the mixture of fragility and resilience that is the human body  --  who took the duty there , particularly at night . In his time , Harmon had seen a seventy-year-old lady some anonymous madman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live , with only a limp in her left leg to show for it , and a Northwestern University linebacker DOA from a fractured skull caused by a fall in the shower in the men 's locker room . As Harmon climbed the clattering metal stairs up to the deserted El platform , he remembered the first one . It was always that way with him . He was never able to see the Duomo of Florence without remembering the first time he and Margaret had seen it , from the window of their pensione . There were some words he could not read without remembering the classroom in which he learned them , and whether it had been sunny that day . It meant there were some things he never lost , that he always had Margaret with him in Florence . And it meant that he could never deal with a ghost without remembering the terror of the first one . He had been working night duty , late , when they brought in a bloody stretcher . It had been quiet for about an hour , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time , but sometimes almost empty . A pedestrian had been hit by a truck while crossing the street . There was a lot of bleeding , mostly internal , and a torn lung filled with blood , a hemothorax . His breathing was audible , a slow dragging gurgle , the sound a straw makes sucking at the bottom of a glass of Coke when the glass is almost empty . Harmon managed to stop much of the bleeding , but by that time the man was in shock . Then the heart went into ventricular fibrillation . Harmon put the paddles on and defibrillated it . When the heart stopped altogether , he put the patient on a pacemaker and an external ventilator . The autopsy subsequently showed substantial damage to the brain stem , as well as complete kidney failure . Every measure Harmon took , as it turned out , was useless , but he managed to keep the patient alive an extra hour , before everything stopped at once , in the ICU . A day or so later , the nurse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a redhead , cute , and reminded him of Margaret when she was young , so he was a little fonder of her than he should have been , particularly since Margaret had been sick . The nurse was n't flirting now , however . She was frightened . She kept hearing someone drinking out of a straw , she said , in a corner of the ER , only there was n't anyone there . She was afraid she was losing her mind , which can happen to you after too many gunshot wounds , suicides , and drug overdoses . Harmon assured her , in what he told himself was a fatherly way , that it was probably something like air in the pipes , which he called an " embolism , " a medical usage that delighted her . She teased him about it . Harmon remembered being vaguely pleased about that , while  | he searched around and listened . He did n't hear anything . It was late , and he finally climbed up on a gurney and went to sleep , as some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never done it before , and why he did it was something he could not remember , though everything about the incident , from the freckles around Rosemary 's nose to the scheduling roster for that night 's medical staff , was abnormally clear in his mind , the way memories of things that happened only yesterday never were . When he woke up , he heard it . A slow dragging gurgle . He listened with his eyes closed , heart pounding . Then it stopped . " Hey , have you seen my car ? " a voice said . " It 's a blue car , a Cutlass , though I guess it 's too dark here to see the color . I know I parked it near here , but I just ca n't find it . " Harmon slowly opened his eyes . Standing in front of him was a fat man in a business suit , holding a briefcase . He was n't bloody , and his face was not pasty white , but Harmon recognized him . It was the man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get home to Berwyn . My wife will be going nuts . She expected me home hours ago . Have you seen the damn car ? It 's a Cutlass , blue . Not a good car , God knows , and it needs work , but I got ta get home . " Harmon had met the wife when she identified the body . She had , indeed , expected him hours ago . " Jeez , I do n't know what I could have done with it . " Harmon was a logical man , and a practical man , and he had n't until that moment realized that those two characteristics could be in conflict . What he saw before him was indubitably a ghost , and as a practical man he had to accept that . He also knew , as a logical man , that ghosts did not , indeed could not , exist . This neat conundrum , however , did not occur to him until somewhat later , because the next time the dead man said , " Do you think you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " he launched himself from the gurney , smashing it back into the wall , bolted from the ER , and did not stop running until he was sitting at the desk in his little office on the fifth floor , shaking desperately and trying not to scream . The El platform was windswept and utterly empty . Harmon walked slowly across its torn asphalt until he came to the spot where it had happened . The police had cleaned up the blood and erased the chalk outline , that curious symbol of the vanished soul used by police photographers as a record of the body , so morning com-  | muters would not be unpleasantly surprised by the cold official evidence of violent death . He did n't have to see it . He could feel it , like standing in the autopsy room and knowing that someone had left the door to the cold room where the bodies were kept open because you could feel the frigid **30;0;TOOLONG air seeping along the floor . He did n't know why he had this particular sense , or ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone with perfect pitch and rhythm who nevertheless dislikes music , someone who could play Bach 's Goldberg Variations through perfectly after hearing the piece only once , and yet hate every single note . It was a vicious curse . He set his black bag down , opened it , and began to remove his instruments . To start , Harmon had cautiously , cautiously , sounded out his colleagues on the subject of ghosts . He 'd read too many books where seemingly reasonable men lost all of their social graces when confronted by the inexplicable and started jabbering and making ridiculous accusations , frightening and embarrassing their friends . So , in a theoretical manner , he asked about ghosts . To his surprise , instead of being suspicious , people either calmly said they did n't believe in them , or the majority had one or more anecdotes about things like the ghost of a child in an old house dropping a ball down the stairs or a hitchhiking girl in a white dress who would only appear to men driving alone and then would vanish from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in perfectly still rooms , or dreams about dying relatives , or any number of irrelevant mystical experiences . No one , when pressed , would admit to having actually seen anything like a real , demonstrably dead man walking and talking and looking for a blue Cutlass . A man who persisted , week after week , in trying to get Harmon to help him find the damn thing . Harmon transferred from the ER . Rosemary thought it was something personal , because she 'd asked him to her house for dinner , and they rarely spoke after that . He told Margaret , however , as much of it as he could . It gave her something to think about , as she lay there in bed and gasped , waiting for the end . She wondered , of course , if the strain of her illness had not made her husband lose what few marbles he had left , as she put it , but she only said this because both of them knew Harmon was coolly sane . It interested her that some people could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to them . She , like Dexter , used the word " gift . " In good scholar 's style , Harmon did research in the dusty abandoned stacks of the witchcraft and folklore sections of North- p 215 western , the University of Chicago , and the University of Illinois , Circle Campus . He even had a friend let him into the private collections of the Field Museum of Natural History . He learned about lemures , the Roman spirits of the dead , about the hauntings of abandoned pavilions by sardonic Chinese ghosts , and about the Amityville Horror . It was all just . . . literature . Stories . Tales to tell at midnight . Not a single one of them had the ring of truth to it , and Harmon was by this time intimately familiar with the true behavior of ghosts . Everyone was very good to him about Margaret , and about what he did to himself as a result , though no one understood the real reason for it . It got to be too much , in the apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that concerned people . They did n't think he was crazy , just " under stress , " that ubiquitous modern disease , which excuses almost anything . Then , someone at the Field Museum mentioned , with the air of an ordinarily respectable man selling someone some particularly vile pornography , that Dexter Warhoff , of the Sphinx and Eye of Truth Bookstore , might have some materials not available in the museum collection . It was rumored that Dexter possessed a bizarrely variant scroll of the Egyptian Book of the Dead , as well as several Mayan codexes not collected in the Popol Vuh or the Dresden Codex , though no one was quite sure . Harmon had come to the conclusion that using ordinary reason in his new circumstances was using Occam 's razor while shaving in a fun-house mirror . Common sense was a normally useful instrument turned dangerous in the wrong situation . So he went to Dexter 's store , drank his sour tea , and talked with him . Dexter scratched his head with elaborate thoughtfulness , then took Harmon upstairs where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty dishes , and brought him into a room piled with newspaper clippings , elaborately color coded , in five different languages , as well as sheets of articles transcribed from newspapers in forty languages more . " You poor guy , " Dexter said sadly . " That 's a terrible way to find out about what 's hidden . I can see that it was terrible . But I must say , I 've been wondering about a few things . You 've got the key there , I think , with this life-support stuff . Look at this . " He showed I larmon a French translation of a photocopied Russian samizdat document from the Crimea . It described ghosts haunting a medical center at an exclusive Yalta sanatorium . The tone was slightly iuetaphorical , but for the first time , Harmon read things that confirmed his own experience . Dexter showed him an article from the house newspaper of a hospital in Bombay , an excerpt from the un-216 THE BREATH OF SUSPENSION  | published reminiscences of a surgeon in Denmark , and a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , from Lancet . The accounts were similar . " There 's almost nothing before the 1930s , very few up to about 1960 , and a fair number from the ' 70s and ' 80s . " " Life support , " Harmon said , when he was done reading . " Artificial life support is responsible . " " Now , Professor , let 's not jump to conclusions . . . . " But Harmon could see that Dexter agreed with him , and for some strange reason that pleased him . " When the body is kept alive by artificial means , for however long , when it should be dead and starting to rot , the soul , which normally is swept away somewhere ? Heaven , Hell , oblivion , the Elysian Fields , it does n't matter  --  is held back in this world , tied to its still-breathing body . And , being held back , it falls in love with life again . " Harmon found himself saying it again , alone on the platform . It had seemed immediately obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation " of the sort a scientist would require . It was , however , more than sufficient for a doctor of medicine , whose standards are different . A doctor only cares about what works , without much attention to why . None of his colleagues had understood , though . He had gotten a little cranky on the subject , ultimately , he had to admit that , but he felt like someone in the eighteenth century campaigning against bloodletting . He had always known that doctors were , by and large , merely skilled fools , so he quickly stopped , but not before acquiring a certain reputation . He drew his chalk circle on the rough surface of the platform , using the brass compass . Using a knife with a triangular blade , he scraped some material from within the circle . No matter how well the police had cleaned , it would contain some substance , most likely the membranes of red blood cells , that had belonged to the dead man . He melted beeswax over a small alcohol lamp whose flame kept going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped a linen wick into a mold of cold worked bronze and poured the wax in . While he waited for the candle to harden , he arranged the speculum , the silver nails , and the brass hammer so that he could reach them quickly . It was strange that most of the techniques they used had their roots in earlier centuries , when ghosts were the extremely rare results of accidental comas or overdoses of toxic drugs . People had had more time then to worry about such things , and some of their methods were surprisingly effective , though Dexter and Harmon had refined them . He set the candle in the center of the circle , lit it , and called Stanley Paterson 's name . p 217 The train still had not come . What was wrong ? Why had there been no notification by the CTA ? Stanley stood on the platform and shivered , wondering why he had wandered away and why he had come back . Where was the damn train ? Beneath his feet he could see a circle of chalk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Had he daydreamed right past the train , with those thoughts of musicians and mothers ? Had the trains stopped for the night ? There was a rumble , and lights appeared down the tracks . They blinded him , for he had been long in darkness , and he stumbled forward with his eyes shut . He felt around for a seat . It seemed like he 'd been waiting forever . " It 's a cold night , is n't it , Stanley ? " a man 's voice said , close by . " Wha ? ? " Stanley jerked his head around and examined the brightly lit train car . It was empty . Then he saw that the man was sitting next to him , a tall old man with sad brown eyes . He was wearing a furry hat . " What are you talking about ? How do you know my name ? " Not waiting for an answer , he turned and pressed his nose against the glass of the window . A form lay there on the platform , sprawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A large pool of blood , black in the lights of the station , had gathered near it , looking like the mouth of a pit . " Stanley , " the man said , his voice patient . " You have to understand a few things . I do n't suppose it 's strictly necessary , but it makes me feel less . . . cruel . " The train pulled into the next station . Out on the platform lay a dead man with a black coat . Three white-clad men burst onto the platform and ran toward it with a stretcher . The train pulled out of the station . " I do n't care how you feel , " Stanley said . The man snorted . " I deserve that , I suppose . But you must understand , the dead can not mix with the living . It just can not be . We had a dead man in our Emergency Room once . He would n't go away . He tried to be part of everything . A ward birthday party turned gloomy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday it was sickened and died within the week . He tried to participate in the close professional friendship of a pair of nurses , built up over long years of night duty and family pain , and they had fights , serious fights , and stopped ever speaking to each other . The gardener , whose joy in his plants he tried to share , grew to hate the roses he took care of , and in the spring they bloomed late and sickly . I 've always liked roses . Life is hell with ghosts around , Stanley . Believe me , I know all about it . " He had put the roses last , he noticed , as if they were more important than people . How much like a doctor he still was ... . 218 THE BREATH OF SUSPENSION DEATHBINDER 219  | Stanley watched as the white-clad men strapped the man in the black coat into the stretcher and rushed off , one of them holding an IV bottle over his head . The train pulled out of the station . " I ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stanley found himself shaken with sobs . How could he explain ? As a child he 'd wanted to play a musical instrument , like his sister , who played the piano , or even Frank , his next-door neighbor , who played the trumpet in the school band . He 'd tried the piano , the saxophone , the cello . None had lasted longer than two years , and he never practiced , despite his mother 's entreaties . As an adult he 'd tried the recorder , the guitar , and failed again . Yet this very night he 'd felt what it was like to play Schumann on a piano and an oboe , and feel the music growing out of the intersection of spirit and instrument . He 'd felt what it was like to be alive . " I know what to do now , do n't you see ? I realize what I was doing wrong , how I was wasting everything . Now I know ! " " So now , at last , you know . " The man shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze mirror in front of Stanley 's face . Stanley looked into the speculum , but saw nothing but roiled darkness , like an endless hole to nowhere . He felt weak . " Lie down , Mr. Pater-son , " Harmon said softly . " You do n't look at all well . You should lie down . " Somehow they had come to be standing on the same damn platform again , as if the train had gone absolutely nowhere at all . The unnatural blankness of the mirror had indeed made him feel dizzy , so Stanley lay down . The platform was hard and cold on his back now . Nothing made sense anymore . He watched the stars spin overhead . Or was it just the lights of the apartment buildings ? " You ca n't leave me here , " he said . " Not just when I 've figured it out . " " Shut up , " Harmon said savagely . " It 's too late . " He drove a long silver nail into Stanley 's right wrist . Stanley felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're dead . " He drove another nail through Stanley 's foot , tinking on the head with a little hammer . " That first one , in the ER . He almost killed us , he was so strong . But we bound him , finally , once we 'd figured out what to do . If I went back there now , I would hear him , talking to himself , as if he 'd just woken up from a nap and was still sleepy . I hear you everywhere , where I have bound you , on street corners , in hallways , in alleys . In beds . " Harmon found himself crying , tears wetting his cheeks , as if he were the one Stanley Paterson was supposed to be feeling sorry for . Stanley Paterson , who would have only the understanding that he was dead , not alive , to keep him for all eternity . " Do n't worry , Stanley . Life is hateful . "  | " No ! " Stanley cried . " I want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed Harmon by the throat . Harmon felt like he was being buried alive , but not buried in clean earth . He was being buried , instead , in the churned-over corrupted earth of an ancient cemetery , full of human teeth and writhing worms . It pushed , damp and greasy , against his face . The smell was unbearable . Darkness swelled before him , and he almost let go . The darkness drained away , and the platform reappeared . Dexter stood over him , his tongue sticking out slightly between his lips . He held the speculum over Stanley 's face , forcing him back . Dex-ter 's clothes flapped , and he leaned forward , as if into a heavy foul wind . " Quick , Professor , " he choked . " He 's a strong one , like I said . " Harmon tapped the fourth nail into Stanley 's left wrist . " I want to live ! " Stanley said , quieter now . Harmon said nothing . Dexter held the fifth nail for him , and he drove it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain still . " He rested back on his heels , breathing heavily . How like a doctor , he thought . He could eliminate the symptom , but not cure the disease . Those ghosts , no longer disturbing the living , would lie where he had nailed them until Judgment Day . And there was nothing he could do to help them . He sat there for a long time until he felt Dexter 's hand on his shoulder . He looked up into that kindly , ugly face , then back at the platform , where five silver dots glittered in the overhead lights . " That was a bad one , Professor . " " They 're all bad . " " It 's worse if they never lived before they died . They want it then , all the more . " Dexter packed the instruments away . Then he rubbed the tension out of Harmon 's back , taking the feel of death up into himself . Dexter , with his credulous beliefs in anything and everything , absurd in his Minnesota Vikings cap with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept moving for even a day . Harmon thought about going home . Margaret would be there , as she always was , on the side of the bed where the blankets were flat and undisturbed . He had n't acted in time , when she had her final , fatal heart attack . He had waited , and doubted his own conclusions , and let them put her on life support for three days in the cardiac ICU , before he decided it was hopeless and let them pull the plug on her . By then , of course , it had been much too late . He should simply have let her die there , next to him . But how could he have done that ? Whenever he changed the sheets , he could see the rounded heads of the five silver nails driven into the mattress , to keep her fixed where she died .  | She had loved life , but she had wanted to stay with him .. . always . So he had lain down on the bed with her and felt her cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anatomy his suicide attempt had been shockingly bad . Slitting your own throat is rarely successful .

But she had loved life , so it was n't as hard as it could have been , though Harmon could not imagine how it could have been any harder . When he came back , she would ask him , sleepily , how it had gone . She always sounded like she was about to fall asleep , but she never did . She never would . " Let 's go , " Dexter said . " It 'll be good to get back to bed . I got ta open the store in three hours . Jeez . " " Yes , Dexter , " Harmon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | September 1349 CE HUGH SOLOMON took a step on the sunlit landing stage of T Center and felt the rocking of a ship 's wooden deck underne his feet . The mountains and bright snowfields of the Rockies vanished , replaced by darkness . He stood , arms loose at his sii and felt the moment of nausea he always did , and the wash of diness from the effects of Tempedrine , the time-traveling di Focusing on the ship Dagmar of Lubeck , a tiny platform in the r dle of the sea fourteen hundred years in the past , had been no ple problem , but it was much too soon to feel pleased with him ! Someone was mucking around with the past , and he had to things to right . The breeze was fresh .

As if in response , the wind shifted he smelled an overpowering odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stepped back , and his foot came down on something - soft .

The sailor shouted warnings and alarms in Swedish , and tr were answering shouts from the darkness all around . Rough hands seized him , and someone lit a torch . The fa of the men around him were pale and sick , with fever-bright e ' Plague . One of them turned , stumbled to the rail , and vomited b bile into the sea . He then slumped to his knees and curled around the pain in his gut . No one moved to help him .  | " Hugh ! " a voice said , in a tone of quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , of course . Sailing in the wrong direction , are n't we ? So you 've come to turn us around . That 's the job of a Full Historian . " Andrew Tarkin stepped forward . " How have you been ? God , " he added , startled . " You 're old . " Though the two of them had been students together , Solomon was now near fifty , while Tarkin , though careworn , his ginger hair thinning , could not have been more than thirty . He stopped his pacing and stared at Solomon , hands on his hips . Solomon glared back . The past always throws up its ghosts , but time travel enabled them to take physical form . He wondered why Tarkin had chosen to resurrect himself from whatever tomb of the past he had been hiding himself in . Solomon was a tall man , with bushy hair now going gray , with cheeks sunken beneath high cheekbones . Tarkin was young , but youth , though vigorous , has many disadvantages when confronted with experience . Particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past for its secrets for almost thirty years . " What do you want from me , Tarkin ? " Solomon said through clenched teeth . He pulled forward , testing the strength of the men who held him . They were weak , shivering uncontrollably with fever , but there were enough to hold him fast . " Do you see him , men ? " Tarkin said , raising his voice to address the crew . " This looks like a man , but it is a demon , appeared among us from Hell . He has burned the innocent with fire . We must destroy him . " Solomon heard , in memory , the crackle of the fire once again , as the boardinghouse burned with Louisa inside it . Questions licked up like flames , but he forced them back . First he had to survive . The effect of the speech on the crew was the opposite of what Tarkin had intended . If the creature they had captured was a fiend from Hell itself , he could pull them all screaming to perdition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarkin 's hate . The light of the torches flickered in the rising wind , and Solomon could see the scurrying shapes of rats just beyond its edge . The deck rocked in the growing swell . Tarkin stepped closer to Solomon . " We were friends once , " he said softly . Looking down , Solomon could see the ring glinting gold on his finger , with bright flecks of emerald in the serpent 's eyes . He 'd always wondered about that damn ring . " You came here to make sure that this ship and its crew crash on the shore of Livonia and spread the Black Death , just as you once made sure that some- p 225 one I loved died . To what end ? To preserve your image of history ? A sense of the duty of a Full Historian ? " " Please , Andy . " Solomon decided to sit on his pride and ask the question . " Do you really think that I caused Louisa 's death ? Is that what it all comes from ? " His pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historian would do anything to get the facts . " You bastard ! " Tarkin shouted , suddenly enraged . " We should both have burned there with her . For you , it 's in the past and it 's what happened . Remember how we argued about the immutability of Time when we were back during our research , in Chicago ? Nothing has changed . You are still in charge of maintaining that immutability . And I still believe that we can never really know what happened , even if we were there to see it . " He stopped , as if expecting Solomon to involve himself in an intellectual argument on the nature of perception . At that moment , a sudden gust of wind caused the ship to heel sharply . There was a bright flash of lightning , followed immediately by a thunderclap , and a heavy rain began to fall , accompanied by a high wind . Tarkin shouted commands to his crew , ordering them to pull in the sails , tighten the sheets , and lash the rudder . They stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Solomon twisted , drove his elbow into the side of one of his remaining captors , and broke free . The men were too panicked to react . Solomon lunged for Tarkin and dragged him to the deck . Lightning flashed above them , and waves crashed over the deck . Tarkin drove the heel of his hand between Solomon 's eyes and knocked him back as the wind tore off the top of the mast with a screaming crash . Rigging fell upon them from overhead . Tarkin rolled over and kicked him with a booted foot . Solomon grabbed at it , but was swept back by a heavy wave . Bitter saltwater filled his nose and mouth , and he choked . He rolled down the deck and grabbed at the railing . He felt himself slipping . There was nothing else he could do . He rolled his eyes up , recalled his conditioning , and an instant later was lying on the windswept surface of the landing stage at the Aerie of Time Center amid the snow-covered peaks of the Canadian Rockies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was blinding . He got to his hands and knees and vomited up a gallon of saltwater . " Son of a bitch , " he said , then fell down and lost consciousness .  | January 2097 CE The last guard post was an old pissoir with the tricolor-and-sun emblem of the Second Commune painted on it . The dim light of a brazier flickered within , though when the guards emerged to check Hugh Solomon 's documents they did n't look any warmer than he was after his climb up the icy heights of Montmartre . The puff of their breaths rose to mingle with the snow that sifted out of the hollow sky and the night that drifted over Paris . " A meeting with a congregation of rooks and sparrows ? " said one of the guards , his beard and moustache glistening with frost . He grinned , revealing missing teeth . " Do n't look for God . He has left that place , that is , if He ever was there . " It took a peculiar sort of obstinacy to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't be a fool , " Solomon said sharply . The man 's face froze , and he stepped back , slowly and carefully . Solomon carried a laissez-passer from the Comite Central itself , or rather , a forgery indistinguishable from it , and was obviously not someone to be trifled with . The guard muttered an apology , which Solomon ignored . The corporal of the guard , a grim , wrinkled man who looked as if he might have once been fat , checked the documents meticulously , despite the fact that Solomon had already passed two other checkpoints on the way up Montmartre . The man held on to duty , though that duty had served three different governments in the last five years , and currently consisted of guarding the approaches to an abandoned cathedral . " Pass , " he said , almost reluctantly , and handed Solomon back the forged documents . So Solomon proceeded up the last slope of the hill to the ruins of the cathedral , dangling a foil-wrapped box by the string that tied it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to a birthday party . The three guards watched him and wondered where the hell he was going . The elongated bone-white elegance of the cathedral of SacreCoeur bulked against the sky , like some vast fossil crustacean left behind by ancient seas . Eighteen years before it had been shattered by the ground shock of the five-megaton fusion explosion near Meaux that had also turned the indolent curves of the Marne into a vast poisonous lake . One of the side domes had been destroyed . The main dome had a crack running through it . Solomon stopped at the top of the tilted marble steps , unwilling to push into the darkness that lay on the other side of the crazily hanging bronze doors . Below him only the occasional flare of a bon-  | fire marked what had once been called the City of Light . The bright pinpoints did nothing against the cold on the top of the hill . He felt himself surrounded by centuries of swirling oily mist , the smoke of carbonized flesh . This was the time of the Great Forgetting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forbidden entry , for the roots of Time Center itself lay here . The world spun dizzily , and Solomon clutched at the doors to keep from falling . He choked and fought to breathe . He thought Katsuro 's help had eliminated the autonomic nerve blocks , but there may have been an even deeper level of conditioning . " Come in , Hugh , " a throbbing liquid voice of uncertain sex said from within . " You 'll catch your death . " The voice chuckled . Solomon stepped over the shattered marble into the nave . Darkness pushed against his face like a shroud . It was warmer inside the church , and he could breathe again . " This way . Come to mama . " With a hissing scratch a candle flickered at the other end of the cathedral . A plump , smooth hand , the fingers covered with glittering rings , held the match up . An invisible pair of lips blew it out . Solomon moved slowly toward the candle , sliding his feet across the uneven rubble-strewn floor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced briefly in the light , vanished , then danced again . The air smelled wet and dusty . Bile stung the back of his throat . He 'd stretched himself to the limit to get here . Acquiring extra illicit doses of Tempedrine from manufactories in sixteenth-century Germany and twentieth-century California , he had pumped himself into almost a state of toxic psychosis to get over the barriers of interdict Time Center had put up around the Great Forgetting , bent Time Center 's mental conditioning with the aid of a Zen Buddhist monk in thirteenth-century japan , and hired a seventeenth-century Dutch engraver to forge his documents . There were some things that even a Full Historian was forbidden to mess with . He only hoped that it would be worth it . When the seated figure became clear in front of him , he stopped , just outside the circle of light cast by the candle , and took a breath . His skull felt as large and unwieldy as the cathedral itself . " If you are who you claim , " he said carefully , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have come to ask . If you are not , there is no reason to even ask it . " Logic was a broken reed that would pierce his hand , but he had nothing else on which to lean . The voice laughed . " I claim nothing , Hugh . Maybe the answer lies inside your own head , and you 've gone through a lot of trouble  | for nothing . But come on , come on . There 's nothing for you to be afraid of . Not here . Not now . " A giggle . " Is that what you came for , Hugh ? It 's a common enough question , and easily answered . Do you want to know the hour and place of your death ? " Solomon froze for a moment , breathing shallowly . If she was who the stories said she was , she really could tell him exactly that . Like a man gazing over a precipice , thinking idly of what it would be like to jump , he felt drawn in spite of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . " No ! " The word ripped from his throat . He leaned forward over her , into the light from the candle , his hands like claws . " You try to tell me and ? " " And what , Hugh ? Do n't be so silly . If I know when you are to die , I certainly know when I will . Not tonight , Hugh , I 'm not going to die tonight . And neither are you , if I 'm not giving anything away . So why do n't we talk ? " Moira Moffette was a grossly fat woman , sprawled in what had once been the bishop 's throne . The candlelight shone on the rich , filthy brocade of her dress and the rings sunk deep into the flesh of her fingers . A tiny pair of feet in embroidered slippers emerged from beneath her dress to hang in the air . Her face was round and smooth . Long lustrous lashes hid her blind eyes . She smiled at him , her teeth horrible and misshapen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were n't expecting beauty . History is a festering wound , and those maggots that feed on it are never beautiful . Does that bother you , fellow maggot ? Never mind , then . What did you bring me ? " she asked , like an eager child . He unwrapped the package . The foil paper crackled and sparkled . " A Sachertorte , " he said . " From Demel 's Konditorei , Vienna , 1889 CE . " He 'd stopped for a coffee , there in the mahogany and crystal interior , then walked out into the sunny spring warmth amid the ladies with their parasols and the gentlemen with their top hats , their faces as clear and open as the sky . He opened the box , and the musty air filled with the rich chocolate aroma of Vienna . " O000h ! " Moffette squealed . " Hugh , you doll ! Give it here , darling , give it here . Oh ! Oh ! With apricot preserves between the layers ! Wonderful . " She grabbed the cake with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite and chewed , cheeks puffed out , eyes screwed up with pleasure . Lank dirty hair hung around her face . Like certain holy men and mystics throughout history , she had the capability of synthesizing a Tempedrine-like chemical in her pineal gland . In order to do that , she needed a chemical p 231 precursor  --  Theobroma , the Food of the Gods : chocolate . Under its influence , the twists and turns of Time were visible to her . Who she was , and how she had come to be here in the twenty-firstcentury ruins of Sacre-Coeur , were facts unknown to anyone , though Solomon had tried to track down every lead and rumor . She might have been a Druid , a witch , a priestess of Magna Mater , a Neanderthal fertility goddess , a chocolate-binging housewife with a deviant physiology , or simply an illusion of senses deranged by overdoses of Tempedrine . " So , tell me , Hugh . What 's your question ? " He paused for a moment , still unsure . " I want to find Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind eyes stared . " Oh , oh . But he 's all over the place . He crosses over and over himself . How could you not have found him ? After all , Hugh , you are in so many times and places yourself . " Then she began to laugh , spilling half-chewed bits of cake onto her front . " Vengeance ! " she said . " It 's a matter of private vengeance . You 've always been so droll , Hugh . " " You 've never met me before , " he grated . " But you have always been droll , have n't you , even if I 've never met you ? You do n't think as clearly as you might , Hugh . But why have you come all this way to bother me with a silly personal mat-ter ? " " It 's not personal . The son of a bitch tried to kill me . " " Nothing more personal than that , is there , Hugh ? " " He 's trying to deform Time itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? " " Never having been born is not the same thing as dying , Hugh . " " Stop playing games , " Solomon said . " You ate the cake , now answer the question . " " Little Miss Moffette sat on her Tophet , " she chanted , like a small child . " Hear her words and pray . " She giggled . " Like it ? I thought it up myself . I wish I could figure out how to finish it . All right , Hugh . You want to find Andy Tarkin . Or at least you think you want to find Andy Tarkin . Whatever you say . " Her eyes suddenly rolled up into her head , and she began to shake . Her breath came sharply through her throat , and she made a sound like the barking of a small dog . After a few minutes , her breathing slowed . " Chicago , Hugh . The Levee . You 've heard of it ? June twelfth , 1902 . A little bar , one of a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden . Just after one in the morning , a table near the hack . He 'll be drinking what they call bourbon , but is n't . " She leaned back and closed her eyes , obviously tired .  | " But , " Solomon said , " but . The Levee . That 's where ? " She opened them again , angry . " I know where it is , Hugh . Think of it as old-home week . I know that 's where she is , our darling Louisa . I know that 's where young man Hugh Solomon is also . You were probably a cute boy , Hugh . The Full Historian as a young man . Andy Tarkin is there , Hugh . Not the young one , young Hugh 's friend . Not even the slightly older one who tried to drown you in the Baltic . It 's the one you need to find . A long way to go to find an old friend , Hugh . That 's what you asked me for , and that 's what you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold in that damn cathedral . How did she stand it , sitting there , eating nothing but chocolate ? But , Jesus , Chicago . Not again . " Now go away , Hugh . I 've had enough of you . If you 're smart , you 'll just go back home to Time Center and forget all about this . People try to kill you all the time . You 've got to learn not to take it so personally . Good night ! " She blew out the candle and let Solomon find his way back to the front door in darkness . June 1902 CE Though it was after midnight , the streets were crowded . The Levee lay sprawled out around Solomon like a nickel whore who 'd made enough to drink herself into a stupor . Probably the widest open vice district in the United States of America , it crammed no fewer than two hundred whorehouses into a few square blocks on the South Side of Chicago , along with taverns , dancing halls , gambling dens , dog-fighting pits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting evangelists . Solomon moved quickly through the fitfully gaslit streets , not looking around himself , for fear of seeing himself when young . His furtive air was usual for the Levee , and no one paid him any attention . Drunken laughter came from an open window in a three-story tenement . He slid past a black man with a bowler hat too large for his head who wanted to sell him some " goofer dust . " Solomon resisted the sudden urge to stop and negotiate with him . It was sometimes too easy to adapt to the time in which one found oneself . Tempedrine brought the human mind into an identity with a time that was not its own . Solomon pushed his way through the swinging double doors of the Lone Star Saloon and Palm Garden . Inside , it was dark , smoky , and raucous . Solomon walked , among wide laughing mouths gleaming with gold teeth and women 's faces p 233 painted heavily into clowns ' masks of false joy , toward the figure slumped over the table in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elbow to stun the brain centers responsible for time travel and injected him in the buttock with a needle he had strapped to his right knee . It was quick , and no one else in the bar noticed a thing . Tarkin turned , his eyes already glazing . He managed an expression of hatred , though he could barely control the muscles of his face . " You again . You 'll never learn , will you . " Solomon stared at him in horror , for this man was older than he was himself , not at all the young man who had trapped him on the Dagmar of Lubeck . Tarkin 's once-red hair was white , and stood out in all directions . Solomon grabbed his hand roughly . Despite his sedation , Tarkin winced . " Where did you get this , Andy ? " The gold ring on Tarkin 's finger was a convenient focus for his rage . Tarkin grinned weakly , but with triumph . " You do n't really want to know . Believe me , you do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to know , " Solomon said , injecting Tempedrine into Tarkin 's carotid artery along with a synaptic impeder , to lower temporal inertia . It was hard to haul someone else through Time , impossible if they were not properly conditioned . The human mind , the only device capable of traveling through Time , tends to want to stay in its own time . They left together , as if they were old friends , Solomon laughing and singing , Tarkin limp , stumbling . " Too much to drink , Billy , " Solomon said for the benefit of the others in the bar , who paid no attention . " I told you , but you just would n't listen . . . time to go home . " " Time , " Tarkin muttered . " Time . " The back alley was a good place to leave from . A few prostrate bodies were scattered here and there , drunk or drugged , of no more account than the lampposts or the complaining cats . Solomon lowered Tarkin to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , slurring . " I gave up trying to kill you after the Dagmar , you know . I figured you 'd come to me , in the end . I was right . " He dropped his head suddenly to the bricks of the alley with a hollow crack . Solomon checked his skull . He had n't fractured it , but there would be a big bump tomorrow . What was Russian for " bump " ? The language came hard now , but soon it would be almost impossible to speak or think anything else . Ah , yes . Shishka . That would do as well as anything . " Now let 's find a few things out , " Solomon said . He whispered the words of release , and the alley was empty .  | February 1930 CE Colonel Fedoseyev leaned forward in his chair , resting his chin on his hands , and stared at prisoner Shishkin with loathing . It was only the fourth day of the interrogation , but he was already bone-tired . Must be getting old . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now look at him . His eyes were gritty , and each breath took a conscious effort . Damn , he was n't the one sitting in the middle of the room on a hard wooden stool . The cut-crystal decanter , carefully polished , filled the room with sparkles when he poured himself a glass of water . He did n't want a drink , but the prisoner , fed on salty food and deprived of water , certainly did . Was he even watching ? Fedoseyev forced himself to swallow the tepid flat liquid with every sign of satisfaction , smacking his lips . He felt bloated . He wanted to lie down and sleep a thousand years . Water dribbled from the glass and made another dark spot on the tattered green baize of the desk , the color picked because it showed off gold . The Soviet State needed gold . " Let 's give it another try , shall we ? " Fedoseyev said heavily . " The name of the jeweler , and his current whereabouts . Then you can have a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just do n't give me any more Arabian Nights stuff . I 'm not an idiot . " Shishkin did n't look as if he had heard . The parasite ! He just sat there , babbling nonsense . Fedoseyev had heard whispers that they were raising desperately needed foreign exchange by selling Rembrandts from the Hermitage to the millionaires of the West . And bastards , greedy bastards everywhere , were hoarding gold . The word had come down through the OGPU , the secret police : get it ! Get the gold . Sweat them ! Squeeze them ! The nation needs it ! So Shishkin , his white hair sticking out in every direction , sat slumped in the interrogation room like some pale insect and tired Fedoseyev by telling him everything but what he wanted to know . He pushed his chair back and walked around the desk . His boot heels clicked on the elaborate parquetry , now deeply scratched . The room had once been part of the Office of Textiles . Darker blue squares on the patterned wallpaper still showed where framed swatches had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpets at the corners of the high ceiling . It was a good one , no windup , no warning at all . The prisoner 's face jerked sideways and he gasped . The smack of the backhanded slap filled the room for an instant and was gone . Captain Solomonov , silent at his secretary 's desk with his pen , inkwell , and p 235 notebook , looked up from his writing , his lean high-cheekboned face carefully expressionless . There was a little blood at the corner of the prisoner 's mouth . Just a bead . Fedoseyev squatted , a huge bear of a man , took the prisoner 's hand , and stared him in the face . Shishkin looked back intently , like a stranger watching an unfamiliar game , failing to puzzle out the rules that governed its play . " Gold is not a solitary beast like an eagle . " Shishkin 's face tightened as Fedoseyev twisted his hand . " No . It is a herd animal . Like cows . Like sheep . So . " He twisted farther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the shepherd ? " The ring on the prisoner 's finger glinted up at him . In spite of himself , Fedoseyev admired it for an instant . It was a snake biting its own tail , the shimmering intricacy of the pattern of scales definitely oriental . Its eyes were green jewels . No wonder the prisoner made up such fanciful stories . But it was gold , rich and heavy , and it was not more than a dozen years old , though it looked slightly melted , as if it had been through a hot fire . Shishkin 's body began to shake , and he sobbed . " I 've told you , " he whispered in his poor Russian . " It was made for me , to give to someone I loved . Long ago in . . . in ? " " In wondrous Araby ? " Fedoseyev roared . " Scum ! I 'm tired of your fairy stories . " He turned and stared out of the window , running his hand over his shaven scalp . The Kremlin towers loomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars were only now replacing the Imperial two-headed eagles that had continued to top them for the dozen years since the Revolution . What the hell was wrong ? The man had obviously broken completely . He eagerly babbled details , complete descriptions of the jeweler , his habits , his place of work . If his mother had made the ring , Shishkin would have turned her in . Why then was everything he said obvious nonsense ? The ring was real . So , therefore , by logical operations Fedoseyev had forgotten since school but was sure still applied , was the jeweler . Only he sold earrings to the wives of Party officials and lived in some sober city in Soviet Central Asia , not Baghdad , or Aleppo , or whatever it was he claimed . Fedoseyev did n't like interrogating lunatics . He squinted over at Solomonov , who sat attentively , pen ready on paper . Solomonov had brought the prisoner in himself and seemed to cherish a particular interest in him , writing every detail of his impossible ravings down in his notebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they had both grown up , or from the Gymnasium . An officer in the OGPU was well placed to pay off old scores .  | With sudden irritation Fedoseyev reached over , twisted the prisoner 's arm behind him , and removed the ring . It slipped off with surprising ease . When he released him , Shishkin slumped back onto his stool and stared off at nothing . " The caravans leave Aleppo in the winter , " Shishkin said . " I saw it . . . the mosque of Jami Zakariyah gleamed blue . The man from Bukhara made her a ring of finest gold . . . I loved her , I thought he had burned her , he who had been my friend . . . I 've guarded her for all these years . " Shishkin had reached a state in which the term " interrogation " was meaningless , and Fedoseyev suddenly lost all interest in continuing . It was only 1930 , after all . Fedoseyev and his kind were still moving inch by inch into savagery , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later such considerations would have seemed foolish , and Fedoseyev would have known that every interrogation was a torture session from start to finish , with information being an irrelevant by-product , but ten years later Fedoseyev would be lying in the gold fields of the Kolyma , frozen to death , having been arrested and interrogated in his turn . He patted Shishkin on the back . " Had an old biddy in here the other day , " he said , confidingly . " Country girl , thought herself smart . Held on a day and a half , then gave it up . Smart girl . Hid it inside the privy . Down inside . A real mess . That 's capitalism for you . Two hundred counterfeit rubles , brass covered with gold . You should have heard her spit . The lice ! The lice ! You were right to shoot them ! " ' He chuckled at the memory , stopped short . He sat down at his desk , pulled out a sheet of paper , and signed it . Without a word he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's incomprehension , also signed it . It was thus that prisoner Shishkin found himself sentenced to ten years in the corrective labor camps , under Section 10 : Anti-Soviet Agitation . Fedoseyev tossed the ring into the air . It twirled and glittered , then vanished into his immense hand . Fedoseyev was fed up with the whole thing . He was a brutal man but not an acquisitive one , showing the selectivity of vices as well as virtues , so he tossed the ring to Solomonov , who , surprised , caught it clumsily . " Take him downstairs , " Fedoseyev said . " He goes on the next transport . " He looked out of the window . Snow had started sifting down from the sky that afternoon , and the dimly seen roofs beneath the window were already blanketed in white . Solomon saluted the OGPU colonel , who ignored this bit of military precision , and led Andy Tarkin out of the interrogation room . They walked through long halls lined with interrogation p 237 rooms and holding cells . Solomon whistled tunelessly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antisoviet parasite . It was good to be wearing the blue shoulder boards of the OGPU , watching officers of the Red Army act deferential , and full professors at Moscow University look frightened . It was good to be finally getting some respect . . . what the hell was he thinking ? Solomonov ... Solomon glanced over at the still-expressionless Tarkin and tried to control his thoughts . He thought about the three-day interrogation and wondered who the next criminal would be  --  no , dammit , he was leaving , not staying here in Moscow in 1930 . He was going to Aleppo , to that time that the interrogation had revealed . Maybe there he could sort out his thoughts . Too much Tempedrine was n't good for you . It really was n't . He led Tarkin down the broad stairs , brass rods attempting to hold down a long vanished carpet , and turned him over to the lieutenant at the desk , along with the paper with the sentence . He left him there to vanish into the empire of the corrective labor camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year of his ten-year sentence . Solomon strolled down the marble-floored hallway , turned a corner , and disappeared . The lieutenant filled out the proper paperwork . Prisoner Shishkin was sent to a cell in Butyrki Prison . After a month in a cell with forty other prisoners , he was taken , at night , by Black Maria , to the Kaluga Gates Transit Prison on the outskirts of Moscow . After two weeks , he was put aboard a train heading east , toward his eventual destination , Sovetskaya Gavan , on the other side of the Soviet Union . The journey would take several months . The train was stopped on a siding near Irkutsk for a week and a half , and when they were ready to move again and mustered the prisoners in order to unload the bodies of those who had frozen in the unheated cars , no trace of prisoner Shishkin could be found . The other prisoners were beaten , but no one could even remember what Shishkin had looked like . The guards put their heads together , and prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in vanishing from the boxcar , and their time . November 949 CE " Pull out my soul , 0 Lord , " Abdullah Ibn-Umar al-Bukhari whispered to himself as he drew the gold wire through the iron die , reducing its diameter yet again , " until I am infinitely long , and lost in thinness . " The wire was now the thickness of a grass stem , suitable for making earrings , but al-Bukhari was not planning to  | stop until it was barely less fine than human hair , for he had more delicate work in mind . " Step by step our fineness increases , but we never manage to approach Thee , 0 Allah . " With a sharp knife he shaved the first inch of wire , then put it into the next smaller hole on the die . He took the end in his tongs and pulled again . " Take the metal away , and we do not exist , but are of Thee , 0 Lord . " Muscles stood out in his bare shoulder and arm . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand of Allah . Men cupped their ears , but heard nothing but whispers and echoes . As he worked , al-Bukhari heard ominous noises , the sounds of crashing waves , dying men . Echoes distort and transform , turning good into evil . The gleaming wire was a golden snake , writhing in agony , twisting itself around the sphere of the Earth until it could take its tail in its own jaws , starting flames with the rubbing of its belly . He smelled the acrid stink , tasted bitter gall at the back of his throat . He stopped pulling , and put his hands over his eyes . He felt the flames of burning and heard the screaming of a horse . A man 's soul was consumed by the flames , leaving ashes . It was bad this time . " 0 Lord , Thy visions tear like Greek lances through my heart . " And suddenly , all was clear , and the wire was wire , simple gold . He picked up the tongs and resumed his task . " Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall man , with a strong jaw and high cheekbones , in the garb of a traveling merchant . His eyes glowed with pain and rage , of guilt and hatred unsatisfied , or so al-Bukhari imagined . He felt that the man had just come from committing a terrible act . Al-Bukhari 's first wife Fatima was a sensible woman who had often urged him to curb his fantastic visions . He always promised her , and always broke his promise . He could not explain to her that they came from outside their time , because he did not know this himself . Al-Bukhari felt a moment of fear , not for himself , but on the stranger 's account . The man carried a heavy load , and his soul wobbled , splay-footed , like a camel about to collapse . " I am called Suleiman Ibn-Mustar , " the stranger said . " May we speak ? " Al-Bukhari got up , and bustled to the front of the shop . Customers should always be treated well , as Fatima had often explained . Al-Bukhari was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his short beard already going gray . He had a sideward gaze and a strong voice that made him a Koran reader most Fridays at the mosque . " Come in and sit . " They sat cross-legged on the carpet and were served cooling drinks of rosewater and honey by Zaynab , al-Bukhari 's second wife . She vanished through the door at the back of the shop into the  | darkness of the house . As he talked , al-Bukhari occasionally turned away to feed his brazier . The shop was full of precisely arranged hammers , tongs , tweezers , anvils , and other equipment . " How may I help you ? " al-Bukhari said . Solomon suddenly felt confusion . What did his quest have to do with this energetic little man and his life in this corner of Time ? Yet , somehow , this man seemed important . " I wish to buy , " he said . Al-Bukhari showed him his work , mostly in gold and enamel , earrings , turban pins , and bridle ornaments . " You are not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bracelet and hung it on his wrist , letting a beam of sunlight fall on it and shatter into glittering splinters . " No , " al-Bukhari said . " I am from Bukhara . That is over two months ' journey from here . " " You must miss your home . " He set the bracelet down and picked up a jewel box of carnelian and onyx . " Your work is excellent . Your gifts would not have been unwelcome at the wedding of al-Ma'mun , or the royal banquet of al-Mutawakkil . " Al-Bukhari colored with pleasure . " Your words do me honor , Suleiman . Those two occasions have no third in Islam . But my home ? Ah , how could you know ? The valley of Sogdiana is one of the four earthly paradises . The gardens and orchards . . . Syria is a dry place . " He crinkled his slanted oriental eyes , remembering . He thought about his cheating uncle , and about the power of visions and the hand of God , but did not speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse . " You have not seen these . " Solomon stared down at the rings in the box , each a gleaming pure circle of gold . Thinking of the ring he had in his pouch , he looked at each in turn . What a hoard ! How delighted Fedoseyev would have been . In this single market he could have made enough arrests to keep him in interrogations for the rest of his life . But the ring he was looking for was not there . They showed a similar technique , though a different style . He looked at al-Bukhari . " Have you sold a ring recently , in the shape of a serpent with its own tail in its mouth ? " " A serpent ... no , I have never made such a ring . " He looked frightened . " With its tail in its mouth . . . " How could Suleiman have known of his vision of the golden serpent ? He stood up , suddenly agitated . " Please ... I must get back to work . It is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was dangerous . Who was he ? What evil did he represent ? Solomon stood also , surprised and himself suddenly suspicious . Did the jeweler know more than he was letting on ? Was he an ally  | of Tarkin 's ? He wished he had Fedoseyev back , and a comfortable interrogation room where he could uncover the truth ... . Al-Bukhari moved quickly to the front of the shop , and froze . Across the street , walking amid the crowds , he saw an Ifrit . He dared not breathe . Why did an evil djinni walk abroad ? A holy man , his voice sonorous against the screaming background , led a gaggle of students toward the blue-domed mosque of Jami Zakariyah , where he would lecture in the courtyard . For all his knowledge of the Koran and the Law , he walked right past the Ifrit without perceiving it . A wealthy noble , turbaned and bearded , peered moodily into a crystal sphere at a stall across the way , while his Greek slave declaimed Aristotle in bad Arabic . The Ifrit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation , he did not notice it . The Ifrit wore the face of guilt , and stalked its victim with staring mad eyes . Al-Bukhari watched with fascination as it pulled its headdress across the lower part of its face , leaving only those staring eyes , and drew a sword . It keened like a newly widowed woman , and attacked . Suleiman swore in some harsh foreign language and drew his own sword with lightning speed . The two blades met with a bold ringing and slid along each other , the unexpected resistance causing the Ifrit to stumble back . It seemed old , somehow , old and slow . Up and down the street were sounds of fear and concern as merchants either hid themselves or tried to protect their merchandise , depending on their personalities . " Tarkin ! " Solomon shouted . But what argument could he use ? Tarkin had every reason to want to kill him . How had he escaped from the train car ? Or was this yet another Tarkin , a younger one ? A younger Tarkin from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had to continue to exist , but there was no time to think about paradoxes . The other clumsily attacked again . Solomon was fascinated by the other 's eyes . What had they looked upon ? His assailant 's reflexes were slow . As the attacking blade moved , Solomon darted aside and drove his blade home . The other fell to the street . Solomon reached forward to pull aside the covering so that he could look Tarkin in the face , but glanced up as he heard the hiss of swords being drawn from scabbards . A body of armed men was approaching , cautiously . The local gendarmerie . Without another thought , he turned and ran . Solomon lost his pursuers for long enough to dart into a cul-de-sac , slap an ampoule of Tempedrine against his neck , and disappear from that time . p 241 June 1902 CE Eras before the First World War were the easiest to travel in without preparation , because everyone took gold , though sometimes at a ruinous discount . Solomon darted up the street and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sold the bemused proprietor his suddenly ridiculous clothes and bought an ill-fitting pair of work pants held up by a length of rope and a wool shirt , much too warm for the day . With these clothes he walked farther up the street and bought a decent suit of clothes . Used to the sudden accesses of wealth that came to gamblers and criminals , this proprietor made no remark about the exchange of rough work clothes for a dress shirt and a suit of light gray gabardine . Yet farther up the street he exchanged gold for dollars , then rented a room in a boardinghouse with a shared kitchen and an outhouse in the back , and prepared to make his investigation . He was only a few blocks from where he and Tarkin had lived  --  were living  --  during their research , but he had already violated so many Time Center regulations that he did not let this bother him . With slow patience , he searched , starting conversations in bars , in stores , on the El . A number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described him as old , while others said he was young . Many professions were ascribed to him . Solomon walked the streets all day and all night , searching every face he passed . Chicago had over a million and a half people in 1902 . There were a lot of faces to look at . He was led to the first Tarkin he saw by a small boy who earned his two bits . Solomon passed by the plate-glass window of a drugstore and saw a middle-aged man wiping down the counter with a white cloth . The second Tarkin , somewhat younger , drove a milk cart . The third Tarkin was an old man who told people 's fortunes , while the fourth was another middle-aged man who worked in a dry goods store . By the time Solomon had seen seven different versions of Andy Tarkin he stopped counting . Each had a somewhat different disguise , hair color , pair of glasses , and posture , but it was n't difficult to spot them once you knew what you were looking for . Each wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time Center screaming fits . He had doubled back on his own life , over and over , weaving a web of himself around the incident that had forever directed his life and Solomon 's . But , Solomon thought as he passed yet another version of Tarkin , this one pushing a knife-sharpening  | cart , he had obviously never succeeded in changing one damn thing about what had happened . As demonstrably physical as it was , Tarkin 's obsession about the past had no more effect on things than such obsessions ever did . But now Solomon had obsessions of his own to deal with , for it was once again late afternoon on June 11 . Before the night was through , he would find out what really had happened at Mrs. Mulvaney 's boardinghouse . " Just think of it as historical research , " he told himself as he walked that long familiar path up the cobblestones of Harrison Street from the end of the streetcar line , past the corner of Wilmot , where Mr. Kirkby kept his prize sow Ernestine in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Mulvaney 's three-story mansard-roofed boardinghouse with the crazily leaning barn next to it . It was a warm day , with a high and clear afternoon . How many times had Tarkin already lived it ? He was stopped cold by a woman 's laugh . A man 's laugh answered it . " It 's true , " the man 's voice insisted . " The Japanese use hard wooden blocks for pillows . So when one of their ambassadors was staying at the Hotel Willard in Washington , where the pillows are full of down , and found the chamber pot under the bed , he used that instead and slept quite well . " " Oh , Hugh , " Louisa said , still laughing . " That still does n't explain why the first time you tried to use a gas jet you almost burned your hair off . " " Where I come from , in North Dakota ? " " Oh , stop that ! " " All right , Tibet . We use yak butter there . " Solomon felt wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Could he ever have flirted so casually with the landlady 's daughter ? He peeked around the edge of the porch . There he sat , lean and young , his hair greased back , wearing a seersucker suit and a straw boater . He looked as if he did n't have a care in the world . Louisa sat across from him , kicking up her heels , dressed in a blue shirtwaist dress with puffy sleeves . Her hair was curly black , and her dark eyes darted all around as she talked . " Mrs. Mulvaney says that dinner is almost ready , " a third voice said . The tousled ginger hair of Tarkin 's head poked around the edge of the door . " Oh , Andy , sit down , sit down with us . " Louisa jumped up and pulled him down next to her , opposite Solomon , so that she was flanked by her two suitors , the two history students who had had p 243 to come eight hundred years into their own pasts to learn what life and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarkin . " " Never felt better , Mr. Solomon . " The old Full Historian Solomon rested his forehead on the cool granite of the boardinghouse 's foundation . This was the last afternoon that either of them would ever be truly at peace . After this it would be nothing but endless blow and counterblow , watching massacres , plagues , and disasters , of never knowing an instant 's peace , for they would both have ceased to be the sort of men who would recognize peace if they were offered it . He stood and listened to them talk and flirt until they were finally called in . As they went in to dinner , Solomon heard Tarkin say , shyly , " I . . . I have something for you , Louisa . I had it made specially . I 'll show you after dinner . " The fire had started in the old barn , which was dry as tinder after three weeks with no rain . His guts cold and hard as ice within him , Solomon commenced to watch the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames would emerge and consume everything , making him the man he now was . The night grew cool , giving up the summer warmth of the afternoon . A breeze sprang up off the lake . The Mulvaney household spread out on the porch and talked in a desultory way . Eleven o'clock passed , announced by the bells of a church , and midnight approached . Still no hint of a fire starting , and it had started just at midnight , the time his younger self usually went to bed . He climbed into a window of the barn and looked around inside . Jenny , Mrs. Mulvaney 's brown mare , nickered softly in the darkness . There was no open flame , such as the kerosene lamp Mrs. O'Leary 's legendary cow had kicked over to start the great Chicago fire of 1871 . The silage was fresh and was kept turned over to prevent fermentation , which could get hot enough to start a smoldering fire . Outside , he could hear the bell of the church tolling the twelve strokes of midnight . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Forgetting , the Historians of Time Center sometimes inadvertently caused temporal paradoxes . Such paradoxes had to be resolved . Solomon 's duty as a Full Historian was explicit . The fire had happened . He had witnessed it . Thus , the fire would happen . Mechanically , because thinking might have stopped him , he pulled off some of the drier stalks of grass and piled them against one of the barn walls . Shaking , he untied Jenny , who nuzzled him curi-ously.  | " You lived , " he whispered . " The rest of us did n't . " He unbolted the door of the barn so that the horse would be able to open it by pushing against it , then without any further hesitation , walked back to the pile of straw , struck a safety match , and touched it to the tinder . In a minute the dry boards of the wall were burning as well . The flames were hot on his face , and the roar as loud as Niagara Falls , which Louisa had always wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . The roof of the barn exploded into flame all at once . Jenny neighed in terror , pounded herself against the barn doors , and escaped onto the street . The barn was filling up with smoke , and already the beams overhead creaked as they were eaten away by the fire . Solomon turned . Standing in the open doorway , staring at him , was the young Tarkin , barefoot , obviously interrupted in his preparations for bed . Tarkin shook his head , as if unable to believe what he was seeing . It would take some moments , Solomon knew , for his astonishment to turn into bitter rage and hatred and not much longer to change him from a friend to an enemy . " Andy ! " Solomon shouted , above the roar of the flames . " Wait ! " But Tarkin was gone , running back toward the house , shouting , " Louisa ! " Solomon ran out after him . The blaze had spread from the barn to the house it leaned against , and flames were already leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son Arnold were even at that moment escaping through a second-floor window onto the bough of a sycamore that stood near the house . His younger self , having been smoking a last pipe on the porch before going to bed , would get into the house and make it halfway up the front stairs before being driven back by the flames . Louisa 's room was on the second floor , facing the alley in back . Tarkin tried to get up to Louisa 's window , but the fire was already licking the wall from base to roof , and he too was forced back . He called her name up at the blazing window . Then , " the bastard , " he yelled , no longer at Louisa 's window , but at the world in general . " The bastard ! Why ? " This was how it started . Solomon walked down to the street . The fire , Louisa 's death , Tarkin 's apparently unmotivated and savage hatred : these had all helped make him the man he was , the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all of these things were the results of acts that he himself had committed precisely because he was the man he was . He felt drained , meaningless , a rolling hoop . Tarkin had every reason to hate him , but p 245 " Larkin would take that hatred out on an innocent man , thus turning him into a man who would someday be worthy of hatred . Before the night was out , Tarkin would try to kill the young Hugh Solomon and , failing , vanish into Time . Tarkin would keep trying to kill Solomon until that time when Solomon , old and bitter , would return to even the score . The old Full Historian walked , slowly , down pitch-black Wilmot and out onto Harrison , brighter , since it had gaslights . Solomon froze . In the bright light in front of Masterson 's General Store was a two-wheeled trap , with a sway-backed gray horse hitched to the front . Sitting in it , a straw hat tied to her head and a heavy valise at her feet , was Louisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew instantly that he was indeed seeing what was before him , and that it was the punch line to the shaggy-dog story that his life was revealed to be . A young man emerged from the store with a package . He was Steven Eichorn , who lived a few blocks away and was studying at the University of Chicago to be a lawyer . He was " Louisa 's young man , " Solomon supposed , and his belatedly revealed existence explained a lot about Louisa 's behavior in the few months preceding the fire . Eichorn leaped into the trap with excessive energy , took the reins , and drove it away down the street . Solomon felt the sharp edge of a knife blade at his ribs . " I thought I 'd never get to you , " Tarkin said . He turned Solomon around . This was a stoop-shouldered Tarkin , as old as the man Solomon had sent to a Soviet prison camp . " Was it worth using yourself up ? " Solomon said . " Tying your entire life into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to love her . But you ca n't recover love , even if you can recover exactly the person who made you love in the first place . Time travel is funny that way , Hugh . It makes you think that you can finally recover the past , but it 's just memory made solid , so that it can hurt you even more . But I tried . I came back here after the last time I tried to kill you , aboard the Dagmar , and finally found out that Louisa had n't died in that fire . If you 'd looked just now you would have seen me , standing on the other side of Masterson 's , looking just as stupid as you . That was when I decided to stay here , always . She fell in love with young Eichorn ? " " He was older than we were , Andy . " Tarkin smiled . " One forgets these things . Was n't it amazing , to watch us there , on that porch ? "  | " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cold comfort . " Urged by Tarkin 's knife , which remained at Solomon 's ribs despite the ease of their conversation , they walked down the street , two old friends leaning on each other for support . " But I did what I could . I arranged for Eichorn to get that trap . I encouraged them to elope . And this evening , about ten years ago for me , I think , I hauled a sheep carcass into Louisa 's room . When the ashes had cooled they carried the remains of Louisa 's body out of the fire . She left the ring I gave her on her nightstand , and I found it in the ruins of the house . " You went to the funeral . Forensic medicine leaves a lot to be desired in 1902 , the coroner was drunk , the fire took place in a less than respectable neighborhood , and he gave the matter about ten minutes of his time . Louisa Mulvaney burned to death in an accidental fire . That was the verdict , Hugh . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , just like I did . You thought you were killing the woman you had once loved , but you were just cooking a rack of lamb . " They walked slowly along , Solomon staring forward blankly , the immediacy of the past overwhelming him , until the sounds and smells around him told him that they were once again in the Levee , which never slept . " This is a good place , " Tarkin said as they entered the Lone Star Saloon and Palm Garden . " I believe you know it . " The place was the same , the lights were the same , the teeth were the same , the faces were the same . " Hey , Mickey ! " Tarkin shouted at the bartender . " Give us one of your Specials ! And I 'll have a gin . " In a minute , a large glass of murky liquid was placed in front of Solomon , who stared at it dully . " Drink up , " Tarkin said . " It will make you feel better . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the young man I was . Why , Andy ? I had n't done anything . " " Shut up and drink . " Solomon shrugged , and with somewhat the air of Socrates drinking the cup of hemlock , drained it . He made a face . Tarkin leaned back and looked at the sign that was just visible behind the bar . " Try the Mickey Finn Special , " it said . Not yet proverbial , the mickey was , in Chicago of 1902 , a new innovation in the art of rolling customers , chloral hydrate and alcohol . Solomon 's eyes rolled up in his head , and he toppled from his chair with a loud groan . " Why did I pursue the young Hugh p 247 Solomon ? Because I knew that eventually it would bring me to the man who was guilty , " Tarkin said . " I have you now , you son of a bitch . " Solomon 's body suddenly vanished . Staring , Tarkin sat heavily back in his chair . He shivered and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again , " he said to himself . " I ca n't . " He was still sitting that way , slumped forward over his drink , when he felt the sharp blow of an elbow on the left side of his head , and the cold slide of a hypodermic needle into his buttock . November 949 CE Solomon stumbled along the street in Aleppo . He wore a heavy wool cloak , which he had bought to throw over his light gray gabardine suit , the height of fashion in early twentieth-century Chicago . He regretted having sold his suit of merchant 's clothes to the clothing dealer . He stopped by a stall and , with his last coins , bought a short , curved sword , not stopping to haggle with the proprietor . There was yet a chance of stopping everything , he thought to himself . He was dizzy and sick . Visions of flames and abandoned cathedrals flashed before his eyes , and the long tiled hallways of Time Center . The mickey and his Tempedrine overdoses had caused him to slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower floor . His palm was sweaty on the pommel of the sword . Finally he saw him standing in front of the shop of al-Bukhari , tall and lean , talking to the short , stocky jeweler . Hatred overwhelmed him . He raised his sword and , screaming , attacked . The earlier Solomon parried the attack skillfully . Despairing and weakened by the drugs in the Mickey Finn , the later Solomon was no match for him , and the penetration of the other 's blade was a release from pain . He fell to the dusty street . The other Solomon fled . Al-Bukhari approached the figure sprawled in front of his shop . Was it indeed an Ifrit ? Ifrits were tormentors and tricksters , but the guilts and sins of men were not normally their concern , for their essential substance was fire , not earth . And they certainly did not bleed , blood pooling at its belly as it curled around its mortal wound . He pulled the cloth away from the face and stared into Solomon 's eyes . " Zaynab ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quickly ! " He knelt down and rested the man 's head on his lap . Zaynab ran out of the shop and paused , eyes wide , when she saw the bleeding  | man . She handed the cup to al-Bukhari , and he put it to the other 's lips . " You are not his brother . Nor are you a djinni in his image , as first I thought . You are he himself . " Solomon choked . " I am . He will now commit great . . . sins . I wanted to stop him . But it is impossible . Everything was fixed in its place , and I could do nothing . " " Your sins are your own , " al-Bukhari said . " Did you not choose whether to commit them ? " He closed his eyes and saw a ship full of dead men blow ashore in sand dunes on the shores of a cold gray sea . A house burned and a horse screamed . Men frozen to death in a box in the snow . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elaborate calligraphy on the dome of a mosque . And the name of the knot was Guilt . " I had to . . . history . . . what happened had to happen or else . " What happened happened because you made it so , " al-Bukhari said , in a moment of total mental transparency . He scarcely knew what he was saying . " Only then was it inevitable . Your fate , friend , lay in your character , not in Time . " " Fate . Here is a piece of fate for you , al-Bukhari . Do with it what you will . In less than six years , the Byzantine Emperor , Nicephoras Phocas , will invade Syria , and sack and burn this city of Aleppo . You miss Bukhara , that beautiful land . Let that be your guide . And perhaps it will go a short way toward absolving me . But now .. . take this , take this ring . " He pulled it from his finger . It was in the shape of a snake biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emerald . And so , with a final sigh , Solomon died . The images faded from al-Bukhari 's mind , and there was just a market street with a dead man in the middle of it , and he had blood on his shirt . Others came and took the body away . June 1902 CE The old man stood behind the barn , bent wearily against the picket fence that marked the end of the lot , looking up at the lights of the Mulvaney house . The night lake breeze was cool but nowhere near as cold as it had just been in the railway car on the siding in Siberia . He shivered . Tarkin , near death , had time-traveled without an injection of Tempedrine , to return here , to the heart of events . It was just before midnight . In a few minutes Solomon would come around the house to set the barn on fire , so that history would take its proper course . Tarkin slowly worked his way through the sycamore saplings that  | grew between the barn and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the bark of the young trees smooth in his hand . Last year 's grass rustled beneath his feet . A small flame flickered in front of him . He stopped and squinted . Two boys , about ten years old , crouched at the corner of the barn trying to light a pipe . It was not a corncob but a heavy meerschaum , probably stolen from a father 's study . They muttered to each other , intent on their business , and did not see Tarkin . One of the boys burned his finger , swore , and dropped the match in the dry grass . It flared up instantly . The boys yelped and fled . The grass caught quickly , and the fire soon started to lick up near the barn wall . Tarkin looked at it for several moments , mesmerized by the flames , then walked over and stomped it out . He looked around the corner of the barn . A tall figure in a gabardine suit walked stiffly from the Mulvaney house to the back barn window . A bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then , Hugh , " Tarkin whispered . He ground out the last hot ashes of the fire with his heel . " We made our choices , and they made us . " Solomon opened the barn window and climbed in . Tarkin vanished into the cool night air . November 949 CE Al-Bukhari squatted and looked at the ring in the palm of his hand , wondering . A shadow loomed over him . " Are you the jeweler al-Bukhari ? " said a young man , very pale , with wild reddish hair . A northerner , a Russian perhaps . His eyes glowed . In love , probably , al-Bukhari thought to himself . When the dead have been cleaned away , there is still time to love . " I am . " He stood . There would be time to think about the flames that would consume Aleppo . He did miss Bukhara dreadfully ... . " I came here to have you make a ring for someone important . " The young Tarkin pointed at the ring al-Bukhari held in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can do it . I would like a ring , if possible , very much like that one . "  | BY THE TIME I got to Bert , the sound of the shelling was sharp and clear in my ears . Someone was having an artillery duel down in the direction of Montauban . There were still some French units there , and it was close to the Somme , where trenches were damp and tempers short . I had heard it start when I was back in Amiens , lying in a bed at Madame Berthier 's , but there it had n't seemed to matter , coming as it did through a set of lace curtains . The light of the declining sun shined the wrong way through the windows of the roofless houses . Before the War , people had lived in the town , then called Albert , but no one remembered those days . There was no one here now but the soldiers , and to them the place was called Bert , with a hard English t . Everyone knew Bert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Verdun , pressed their crosses to their lips and thought of it . Russian conscripts drowning in shell holes at Aubers died whispering its name . German regulars on garrison duty along the Piave sang songs about it . For it was from this spot that the Golden Virgin tormented us . Before the War , a huge gilded statue of the Virgin had stood atop the Basilica of Albert . She had proved a natural target for the German long-range guns located back toward Bapaume , though for a long time the tower suffered no damage . Finally one day a shell exploded just at the Virgin 's feet . She toppled forward , slowly at first , then accelerating as she swung downward toward the earth ... and stopped . And so she had hung there ever since , feet above her head , angled just past the horizontal , dangling precariously yet never falling . No amount of shelling had ever managed to get her to budge another inch . She was a miracle . All of us , all the men of the War , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell us . Theories abounded . Some  | held that she was throwing the infant Jesus down to the street , sacrificing Him before His time as an expiation to end the slaughter . Others thought that she was bent over in grief , for from her vantage point she could examine at her leisure the vast meat grinder of Somme sector . Or was she just trying to dodge the shells that flew past ? To me it had always seemed that He had strayed somehow , and she had just leaned forward and gathered Him back up in her arms . His expression indicated that He was n't sure whether to be pleased . One thing was known by everyone , from the Channel , across Switzerland , and to the Adriatic : when she ceased to balance there on her tower and at last fell , the War would end . It was obvious that she would never fall . It was rumored that she was wired in place , with cables running down into the ruined basilica , holding her up , that German gunners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had indeed already fallen twice , but each time had been replaced by an identical replica , for High Command , which in the soldiers ' mythology ruled both sides , had fattened on the nearly two decades of war that had ludicrously followed the assassination of a pompous Austrian archduke and had no desire to ever see it end . Two American soldiers were guarding the front of the basilica , ostensibly because it was used as an artillery spotting post . They shared a cigarette , and I could smell its aroma out where I stood in the street . I considered my chances of hitting them up for some . Rather small , I thought . Nonexistent . There was still hostility between British and American expeditionary troops , lingering from the riots and mutinies of ' 26 and ' 27 . Besides , I wore pressed cardboard boots with soles made from the treads of old tires , and my uniform was patched with bits of cloth that almost  --  but not quite ? matched , while they looked like real soldiers , with polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath to catch the traces of tobacco smoke , glanced a last time up at the serene face of the Golden Virgin as she hovered over me , and made my way through the rubble to the far edge of town to join my company as it mustered after our liberty . The place was a dusty quadrangle that had once been a football field . The quad was crowded with men , soberly lying to each other about the achievements of their liberties , but I saw my company standing at its usual spot , just at the corner of the military brothel , which stood where the goalposts had once been . The brothel had no name , only a number , although it was called a number of things , BENEATH THE SHADOW OF HER SMILE 255  | of course , by the men who sought release there . It was built of poured concrete , and its windows were narrow slits . Near the door was a sign detailing venereal disease symptoms in eleven languages . The main advantage of this was that it gave one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been a long time since I 'd lain on one of its rough stained pallets . I arched my back slightly as I walked , feeling the clean linen of Mme. Berthier 's establishment on my bare skin , remember-ing .... Toby had stayed out all night again . He 'd been locked in the cellar the evening before to tend to his task , which was catching mice , but he 'd thought of more important matters and I found him on the roof , smoothing his whiskers in male satisfaction , when I opened the shutters in the morning . He looked up at me and meowed . " Toby , " I hissed . " Get the hell ? " It was too late . Lisette froze in the middle of that charming childlike stretch and squeak with which she wakes herself , and looked out at the cat with her wide cornflower-blue eyes . She tossed her golden hair back and flounced over to the window . " Toby ! " she said , reaching out her hand . The cat rubbed against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . For that , you will stay out . " She flicked him off the steeply pitched roof to the yard below , where Barbarossa , Mme. Berthier 's mastiff , was waiting . I saw a yellow yowling streak go across the yard and over the fence . He never learned . That damn stupid roving cat never learned . Lisette smiled at me , and kissed my earlobe . " Poor kitty , " she said . " Poor kitty . " She pirouetted joyfully . I took hold of her , and she giggled . I always wanted Lisette above the others , for she was so beautiful , and simple , in both her pleasures and her cruelties . My hand explored inside her robe . " Bad boy , " she said . " Bad . " " No , no . Good . Very good . " The door opened with a squeak of hinges . I turned . Standing in the doorway was a stout woman with dark dyed hair and a trace of a moustache , which she made no attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers were loaded with rings , which glittered in the morning light . " Time to go , Mr. Beeman , " she said . Her voice was deep , yet oddly unresonant . " Please release my Lisette , as she has other duties . We have a major of a Highlander regiment downstairs who wishes to see her . " So , demurely , eyes downcast , Lisette walked past her mother and down the stairs , knotting her robe . Mme. Berthier had several times described to me the event of 256 THE BREATH OF SUSPENSION  | Lisette 's conception . It had happened when she was newly married , her husband at the front . She was walking home from church one day in autumn , the leaves turning , drifting down , and crunching beneath her feet , when she met her Fate in the form of a young Canadian officer who raped her . She remembered him vaguely , but with ? as had gathered over the years  --  some measure of affection . He 'd had golden hair like the sun , which Lisette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues , I saw him as the sort of handsome lad that schoolboys get their first crush on . I was sure that the men in his unit had loved him to distraction . Her husband , whose name I never learned , was killed at the front shortly thereafter , and with a child to support , she took up a new profession . So Lisette had grown up on the edge of the War , eventually to work in her mother 's establishment , which by the time I came there consisted of five girls in a large well-appointed house on a quiet avenue lined with plane trees . Aristocracy , in those times . They served good English breakfasts there . I went downstairs to eat one before I left . " Welcome home , Dick . I knew you would n't be able to stay away . I 'd kill a fatted calf , but I have a better burnt offering . " The speaker was Frank Harris , who stood with our fellow NCO , Larry Pogue , leaning against the wall of the brothel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of a hero , although of course being alive , he was n't one . He reached into a pocket and pulled out a cigarette , which he waved at me . " American , " he said . " From Virginia . At least that 's what the sailor told me . Do n't ask what I had to do to get it . " I did n't have to . " Take a puff , Dick . " Pogue was shorter than either Harris or me , with sharp features and dark mystic eyes . Although my body cried out for it , I tried to give the appearance of considering the offer judiciously , as if I did n't care . My act fooled no one , and I finally grabbed it . I felt better immediately . Captain Totenham 's ADC , Perkins , at last after much swearing got us all formed up for the march back to the main trench , where we would spend five days before moving back to the reserve trenches . The spot where we stood was already in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines was nearly five miles . The military brothel itself , in obedience to regulations , had a Vickers .303 emplacement on its roof . The captain leaned sourly against the concrete wall , watching Perkins take roll . He had spent liberty in Paris , but it did n't seem to have made him any happier . The tap of his cane against his prosthetic left foot indicated impatience , BENEATH THE SHADOW OF HER SMILE 257  | and everyone was glad when Perkins got us lined up and the tapping stopped . We marched down the Roman Road , which stretched from Bert to Bapaume , on the other side of the front . Nearly two thousand years old , it arrowed across the countryside but had been shelled so heavily that it was only suitable for foot traffic . We reached the end of the communication trench , which burrowed gradually into the earth , and turned into it . As we marched , the level of the ground rising above our heads , I thought of Lisette . This liberty , in response to some idle questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time telling her about my boyhood , of the times before , as the recruiting posters had it , the King had called me to war , while she lay back on the bed , whistling at the budgie to make it sing . I told her about my mother , and the toy soldiers . I still remember the wooden box that held them and the splendid weight it had when they had all been carefully stacked inside . They were fragments of many of the family 's boyhoods , and were all mismatched , all different colors , like meadow flowers . French cuirassiers , Russian uhlans , American bluecoats from their Civil War , red pantalooned Zouaves , long-coated foot soldiers from the army of Frederick the Great , roundhead cavalry , even one lonely Babylonian in skirt and headdress , carrying spear and shield . What pleasure those soldiers brought me ! I would lose myself in arranging them , marching them in columns , charging them up the valley at Balaclava , holding Hougoumont against the French at Waterloo , pounding the insolent Swedes at Poltava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dashing and disciplined , even if some of them , particularly the soft lead ones , were missing arms , legs , and even heads . And my mother would call me in for supper , and I would not hear . My mother made a mistake here , for she interpreted this boyish disinclination to quit a game as insolence , which was the one thing she could not bear . My scoldings were severe . One day she finally shouted in exasperation , " Stay then , with your soldiers ! " and latched the door . I suppose if I had begged her forgiveness , she would soon have relented and let me inside to eat , but little boys can be more stubborn than mothers , and are seldom inclined to be wise . With forced gaiety , I picked up my men and went back to war . We fought battles beneath the kitchen window , made long retreats through rough country , then attacked again on the plain . War began to drag , the Seven Years ' War stretching to eighteen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , another began . This went on , as the moon rose in the sky , illuminating the now ghostly soldiers ,  | until the little boy 's eyes grew weary and he fell asleep on the grass . Some unknown friend knocked on the door , and my mother came out and carried me inside . We finally arrived at the main firing trench , the eight-foot-deep hole in the ground that was home . In front was a three-foot parapet of heaped earth , in back was a one-foot parados . The walls were supported by sandbags , corrugated iron , bundles of sticks , bricks , and stones . Repairs had to be continuous , else the sides of the trench would collapse . Wire repair crews were sent out , and one group of men was set to extending a sap . We were going to build a new machine-gun post at the end . Those who were not thus employed retired , despite their weariness , to their gardens , which filled the area between the parados and the mortar emplacements with a tangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trenches in turn shared these gardens through a complex set of arrangements that had grown up over the years , and by now seemed eternal . I leaned back against the parapet , crossed my arms , and watched them . I could hear two soldiers chaffing each other , obscenely comparing the sizes of their cucumbers . " Give it up , Dick . Plant a row of peas . " Pogue stood next to me , mattock in hand . " A small thing , surely . " " I 'm a soldier , not a farmer , damn you , " I said sharply , startled by my own vehemence . Pogue turned away , a slight smile on his lips . " Just a suggestion , Dick , just a suggestion . " He clambered over the parados and headed toward his cabbages . " Corporal Beeman ? " said a timid voice . It was Private Willoughby . He was young , not more than fifteen , and had somehow blurred features , as if built hurriedly before the holidays . His watery blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers ' dugout , and he seemed ready to bolt . " Yes , Willoughby ? " " It 's . . . it 's . . . . " He struggled to get the words out . " It 's .. . I just saw the Yellow Man ! " Inwardly , I groaned . " Indeed ? And where did you see this , ah , apparition ? " " Catfish Row . He was walking toward me with that face , all bloated , and the gas was pouring out of his mouth , just pouring out , Corporal , like smoke from a chimney . I could smell it ! New mown hay . That means a German gas attack , does n't it ? Should n't we warn everybody ? " I sighed . " That wo n't be necessary . I 'll go take a look . Catfish Row , you said ? " 1 BENEATH THE SHADOW OF HER SMILE 259  | " Yes , sir . " " Do n't talk about this to anyone else . Just stay here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should the enemy gain control of any part of them . I headed down past Times Square and the Embarcadero . The trenches had previously been occupied by American troops , and none of us had found the energy to take down the neatly lettered signs that named the various traverses of the main trench . My universe was limited to the distance to the next bend . The Yellow Man had made his appearance in the soldiers ' mythology back in the twenties . He was someone who had been caught in a combined gas attack with no protection , but had somehow , by the dark of the moon , been transformed rather than killed . His skin was covered with blisters and open sores , his eyes were red and hemorrhaged , his flesh was rotting , his lips were a bright blue . He no longer breathed oxygen , but needed to inhale the poison gases for his survival . Thus , he was supposed to appear whenever a gas attack was imminent , so that he could breathe . I turned the corner to Catfish Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of new mown hay . Phosgene , or diphosgene . I drew back , fingering the gas mask that hung on my hip . The moon had risen , and its light shined full into the trench . A few rats scurried about , but no Yellow Man was visible . The concentration did not seem serious , so I clipped on a simple nasopharyngeal filter rather than putting on the uncomfortable mask , and went forward . After searching around a bit , I climbed over the parapet into no-man's-land . Up and down the line I could hear desultory gunfire and see , here and there , the eye hurting , hanging glare of Very flares . The artillery I had heard earlier had fallen silent , their crews for the moment weary of war . I found it just beneath a clump of barbed wire . A gas cylinder . It was n't rusted , although it must have been there awhile , and upon closer examination I found that it was made out of aluminium . Damn clever , these Americans , I thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trench . In much of the same way as men see faces in rocks and tree stumps , and hear the approach of a beloved in every rustle of autumn leaves , so Willoughby had smelled the Yellow Man in the phosgene . I found someone to carry the thing off to a Field Ordnance Park , and headed back toward my home traverse . Like a summer thunderstorm , a gunfight suddenly tore across no-man's-land . Everyone along the line joined in , shooting at nothing in particular , but making a great racket . Above me , human figures were silhouetted above the parapet , and I heard the thump  | of something being dumped into the trench , something about the size and shape of a human body . Another thump , softer this time , and a groan . " Who 's there ? " hissed a voice . I made it out as Lieutenant Wallace 's . " Beeman . " " Good . Come give us some help while Jeremy goes to get a medic . " Jeremy King ran off into the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans were building a few hundred yards down the line . It looked to be a forward gun emplace-ment . Hopkins was dead , a clean hole through his forehead . Smith and Calloway stood nearby , gasping , grateful to be back in the security of the trench . I heard moaning . Bending over , I saw Private Ackerman . His right leg was missing at the knee . The blood looked like black syrup as it spilled out in the moonlight . I pulled off my belt , which was still real leather , and looped it around the stump of his leg as a tourniquet . I pulled it tight , and the bleeding stopped . After a moment , a Medical Officer and two stretcher bearers came and picked Ackerman up , to take him to the Casualty Clearing Station and thence to a Base Hospital , perhaps one in England . He 'd be back in six months , with an artificial leg like Captain Totenham 's . I looked in the direction they 'd taken him and hoped he 'd have enough sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when I returned , whistling idly to himself as he cleaned the head of his mattock . The task absorbed him , and it did not seem that he noticed me . There was something about Pogue that always bothered me . We were all superstitious , of course , and each had his own protective charm or set of ritual habits that he believed kept him from harm . Most of us kept believing in ours until we were blown to bits . I had mine . I have it still . A colored bit of rock shaped like the head of an ax , worn around the neck on a chain . Lisette gave it to me . She had found it , somewhere . Pogue 's beliefs and talismans , however , carried the implication of having a significance beyond that of mere terror of dissolution , of being more religion than superstition . I did n't know why that disquieted me . He looked up and smiled , teeth bright in his muddy face . " Yellow Man take a while to dispose of ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wanting something to do . " " Spot of bother . Hopkins got himself shot . And Ackerman left a leg in no-man's-land . " He sucked air between his teeth . " Too bad . They should have BENEATH THE SHADOW OF HER SMILE 261  | waited . Ah , well . " He paused . " Have you heard how the end of the War will be signaled , Dick ? " I knew he did n't mean by wireless , or runner , or telephone , or anything like that . " I 've heard the stories . " The image had pursued me in dreams after I first heard about it . " The firing of four black or dark blue Very lights . " Flares did not come in those colors , of course , and I remembered them , in my dreams , hanging dark and brooding over a nighttime landscape of tattered corpses where none remained alive to note that the War was over . My mouth was full of dirt and I could not laugh . " Why are you bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have that Very pistol . I bought it from an old magic woman in Amiens . " I groaned . " First Willoughby and his damned Yellow Man , and now you have to go round the bend and start blathering on about old magic women and Very pistols . You 've been taken , but the crone 's got a line into a supply depot somewhere . You should report her . " " Might as well report the moon for being out after curfew . Settle down , Dick . Settle down . Let me tell you a story . A war story . " He sat down in the earth with the air of a man sinking into his favorite armchair at home , in front of a fire . " A war story , " I grumbled . " Just the thing to calm my nerves . " But I sat . It was cold and damp . " There once was a man , quite a long time ago , a man of the land , who was called to war by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar place , and afraid of death on the field of battle , but he obeyed , and went , leaving his crops , and his land , and his home . He served well in the war . He had a quick wit , and a sense of order , so he became their equivalent of an NCO . When the war finally ended , he found that he did not want to return home . The slap of foreign hills beneath his sandals was a more pleasing feeling than the squish of his own soil between his toes . The work , he found , was easier , and more interesting , his men respected him , and his captains recognized him . He 'd found a career for which he was suited . " So he went to the capital , and lay a night and a day on the stone floor of the temple of the Goddess , she who made the plants to grow and the rain to fall and to whom all farmers made their prayers , and all soldiers likewise , for men wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat his head against the stones and begged her to free him from his life of toil and allow him to continue at war . " Women can be unreasonable , at least as men understand these  | things , and goddesses are no exception . Angered , for she misinterpreted his manly disinclination to quit what to him was an exciting game as insolence , she bade him to stay with his soldiers , if he wished , for his war was not yet over . So he picked up his spear and his shield and went back to the war , which had started anew . They sacked cities and forded streams ; they made long retreats through the mountain passes and attacked again along the river . And he began to grow weary , for it seemed that just as the war was over , another began .... " The earth was cold . I shifted uncomfortably , confused and irritated by Pogue 's rambling . " What does this fable have to do with Very pistols ? " He yawned . " Not much , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door . Let 's just say that some of the soldier 's comrades-in-arms were on somewhat better terms with the Goddess than he , and realized that it sometimes takes a third party to effect a reconciliation . " I did n't understand him at all . " And our friend the soldier ? " " Marches those hills yet . " I looked up at the bean poles standing silver in the moonlight . " Still beats farming . " He laughed , a short , sharp sound , almost a sob . " Stubborn , stubborn . Lucky his friends are just as stubborn . " I sighed . " How much did the bloody thing cost , anyway ? " " Twenty head of cabbage , ten kilos potatoes , one kilo peas , two dozen tomatoes . Most of my summer 's production . " I do n't know why I played along with his stupid game . " Why do the soldier 's friends keep trying ? " " Because they know that eventually they will succeed . " And he stood up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the dark passage of the trench . Harris and I stared off at the enemy lines , trying to see what had been built there during the night . It was just after dawn . A mist covered no-man's-land , and there was a feeling of rain clouds coming off the North Sea . We were standing at the end of the sap dug the previous night . The barbed wire surrounding us gleamed silver , unlike the older thickets guarding the rest of the trench , which had long ago rusted to a soft autumnal orange-brown color , looking more like hedgerows than like something that would tear you to shreds if you fell against it . No-man's-land was a green carpet , vivid in the mist , which  | quickly swallowed the craters of exploding shells . It rained much in Picardy , and plants did well there , particularly when fertilized . No-man's-land at the Somme was probably the best fertilized area on the face of the globe . The bodies that fell there vanished , but the equipment remained . I could see helmets , rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once worn with panache in a frontal assault . Examining this detritus , I could trace the history of the War , like an archaeologist winnowing potsherds . There were the remnants of an experimental respirator , used in ' 28 , the grinning remains of a skull inside it . Here lay a rifle with the stock made out of a brittle synthetic , 1931 . Everywhere lay helmets . I could see one , German , with a brass spike on it , that must have been from before 1920 . Another was gleaming beryl steel , of American manufacture . Everywhere were the flowers of Picardy . Red poppies , yellow cabbage flowers , white cornflowers ; for them there was no War . One helmet , overturned , served as a flowerpot and was full of a bobbing mass of blue cornflowers . Harris peered through his binoculars and scowled . " Ca n't see a bloody thing . Could be a machine-gun emplacement . Could be the anchor point for a mechanical sapping operation . Could be a new cookhouse for the frontline boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sauerkraut or borscht . Could be a new twelve-hole privy , in which case I vote for an immediate assault so that we can use it before it starts to stink . Let 's go . " He turned , and a rat squealed beneath his feet . He aimed a kick at it , cursing , but it hid behind some duckboards . Back in the trench , life had settled into its faded routine . A gang was repairing the trench wall . Others were cleaning their weapons or attempting to write letters . Most were trying to sleep , though , curled up in funk holes dug in the walls . I descended into the officers ' dugout . Pogue and Captain Totenham were in the NCO 's dugout , discussing some operation that I did n't want to hear about , for I suspected I 'd be hearing about it soon enough and I wanted to write a letter . Most of my immediate family somehow came to be lost in the years of war , but I had been thinking about a cousin , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Manchester when I had been a child . He 'd been mentioned at my house once or twice , though I did n't remember by whom . I had no one else to write to , and I thought that if I sent it off to General Delivery at those two cities , he might get the letter . I preferred writing on tables to balancing things on my knees and was hoping that the table in the dugout would be free .  | Lieutenant Wallace was sitting at it , filling out a letter of condolence to the parents of Hopkins . He had a little book , issued to officers , open to the page that contained the approved phrases and adjectives for letters of condolence to the relatives of soldiers killed in action . He looked up . " Beeman , I 'm stuck here . Which would you say Hopkins was , gallant , brave , or intrepid ? " I remembered the hole through his forehead . " How , precisely , did he die ? " " He tried to jump me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He panicked , wanted to go back . Bloody bother , and my shot brought fire down on us . Tough luck for Ackerman , that . " I gave it some thought . " Heroic . Try heroic . " He peered at his book . " Hmmm . . . does n't seem to be on the list , Beeman . Funny thing , that . Heroic ' is n't here . Neither is bloody fool , ' for that matter . Intrepid . ' Good word , intrepid . A public school , rugger sort of word . " He wrote it down , pleased with himself . It took me less than five minutes to give up on the letter . I could n't think of a thing to write , and I realized that I was n't even sure of his name . I decided to try again some other time , and left the dugout . Outside , the sky had clouded up and a drizzle looked imminent . I yawned , and realized how long it had been since last I slept . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dugout , and near me was a two-man funk hole with only one man in it : Willoughby . I pulled out my waterproof sheet and curled up next to him . Sleeping , I dreamed . The land was green and fruitful . The corn was high , and date palms hung their heavy loads of fruit over the fresh-running irrigation channels . I ran across the fields , tripping over the uneven soil , hearing the sounds of her hounds close behind me . They dug in the earth , the men of that land , slowly and patiently , their faces shaded from the glaring sun by broad-brimmed felt hats . They did not heed my cries for aid , but continued to dig their earth , grinding the clods up . Some swung sickles , collecting the sheaves of corn . The land was flat , horizon to horizon , but ahead of me rose a steep hill , and atop it stood a tower . I ran up its side . It was covered with brambles , and my shirt tore , and I bled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the hounds , and she was still in pursuit of me . I tore free of the brambles and ran up the steps of the basilica , stopping directly beneath the Virgin . The American guards were gone . She looked down on me with a half smile , even as her hounds closed on me . Pulling a knife from my pocket , I  | started to lever at one of the bricks . I could hear the sharp crump of the German 88s and the return fire of French mortars . A strange broad-winged monoplane with English markings flew overhead , and as it banked away to the left , the pilot , in his clever enclosed cockpit , waved to me in greeting . The brick finally came loose . Someone tapped my shoulder , and Pogue was close behind me , wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat . He stretched out his hand . Between thumb and forefinger he held a pea . I paused a moment , my heart full of wild rage , but I heard the bay of the hounds ever nearer and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pea and thrust it into the opening left by the brick . The entire basilica creaked and groaned . The guns stopped . A pea plant emerged from the hole and crawled its way up the side of the tower . I looked up at the Virgin . Her expression was joyful , radiant . She leaned forward to gather me up into her arms . Then there was a rumble , and at long last she broke free of the tower and began to fall toward me . As she got closer , I saw that she wore Lisette 's face . For a moment I was happy , then felt the sharp fear of being crushed beneath her . I cried out " Mother ! " as her face rushed toward me ... . I awoke . Willoughby had huddled against me in his sleep , pushing me into the side of the funk hole . He was murmuring , " Mother . . . Mother . . . " under his breath , shivering . With a surge of annoyance , I shoved him over to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling from the sky . I let it fall on my face , trying to pretend that the tracks of tears were nothing but raindrops . I stood up and looked at the sky . From the light , evening stand-to would be shortly . I heard the whistle of an incoming shell . Instead of diving into a funk hole and cowering against the wall , I looked up . It hit a few traverses down from where I stood . The blast thundered and cast a soldier into the air . He had his arms flung out , as if to embrace the sky . His body landed on the parapet , where it was stitched by machine-gun fire by a German who had no better target . A hand reached out and grabbed the body by an ankle , pulling it back into the trench . The firing stopped . Captain Totenham walked up and told me that Pogue and I were leading a patrol that night . I said nothing . The air in no-man's-land is thick and cloying , quite unlike the sweat and cordite stink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead men 's flesh , which does , in fact , make up part of its composition . Every bump and dip in that terrain was familiar to us , but only familiar as seen at night , through a haze of fear . Pogue strode on , past the huge old mine crater full of water
