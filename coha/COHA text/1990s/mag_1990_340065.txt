Armenians and Azerbaijanis finally sat down to discuss their differences last week , but not on their own turf . Instead representatives from the two Soviet republics gathered in Riga , the capital of Latvia . Leaders of the Azerbaijani Popular Front and the Armenian National Movement accepted a call from their Baltic counterparts to open talks on their two years of violent clashes . Emerging from the first session , both groups agreed to seek the release of all hostages by March 1 and to establish permanent relations between the two groups . No speedy peace settlement is expected , if only because the Azerbaijanis refused to discuss the future of Nagorno-Karabakh , the center of the dispute . Even so , the multifront meeting illustrates a dramatic shift of power from Moscow into the hands of local nationalists .
