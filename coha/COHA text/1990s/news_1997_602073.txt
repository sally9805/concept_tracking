<p> Neither rain , nor sleet , nor Christmas-like lines will stop the Postal Service from snaring United Parcel Service 's customers during the strike and keeping at least some of them over the long haul . <p> Joke all you want about lost letters , slow-as-molasses delivery and sometimes-unstable employees . The Postal Service , perhaps more than any other carrier , has been there for stressed-out customers  --  especially small businesses  --  during the 11-day-old strike . <p> UPS normally delivers 12 million packages a day and handles 80% of U.S. ground shipments . The Postal Service says it has picked up 15% to 20% of that volume : Its overnight mail has jumped 70% nationwide ; priority mail is up 50% ; and parcel post is up 20% . <p> To be sure , other carriers also are scrambling to fill the gaping void left by the UPS strike in package and overnight delivery , including Federal Express and RPS . But for the Postal Service , the crisis is more than a chance to nab some extra bucks for a few weeks . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform its image from a poky bureaucracy to a sleek , customer-driven business . <p> Known as the provider-by-default for letters and small packages , the Postal Service sees the strike as a further springboard to the more lucrative commercial market . <p> " We realize a lot of customers will migrate back to UPS after the strike , but we see this as an opportunity to garner more business , " Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders says . " This is our opportunity to shine . " <p> Or to falter . The crisis poses the risk of derailing the Postal Service 's new-look advertising campaign , which is aimed at taking business from UPS and other competitors . After all , the Postal Service is famously adept at handling overnight mail . <p> It sends 57 million overnight pieces a year and 960 million pieces of priority ( 2- to 3-day delivery ) mail . But the agency ships just 151 million packages parcel post , or ground delivery . That 's 600,000 packages a day , compared with UPS ' 10 million a day . The Postal Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lacks the systems for huge volumes of bulk packages . <p> For example , unlike UPS , the agency can not offer volume discounts or track packages . <p> Good timing <p> " They can show how good they are , but the volume is out there to swamp them , " says Greg Smith , vice president of the Colography Group , a logistics consulting firm . <p> In many ways , the strike could n't have come at a better time for the Postal Service . In 1982 , the agency began operating as a standalone business , without federal subsidies . For years , however , it continued to operate more like a government bureaucracy than a profit center . <p> Rates were raised virtually every third year . As a result , the service endured repeated cycles of turning a profit one year , breaking even the next and losing money the next . Overall , it lost $ 9 billion from 1970 to 1994 . <p> The turning point came when Marvin Runyon took over as Postmaster General in 1992 . He dramatically increased automation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosted marketing initiatives . <p> And instead of blindly raising rates 20% every three years , the agency is more market-sensitive . It boosted prices 10% in 1995 and is proposing a one-cent increase for stamps next year . <p> The result : The agency is projecting a roughly $ 1 billion surplus this year  --  its third straight annual profit after four years of losses . <p> The strike offers the most tangible way to reach customers with its message . <p> " Customers can see for themselves that we 're customer-focused and that our service is equal to or better than our competitors , " says John Wargo , vice president of customer relations . <p> Facing the storm <p> Analysts and customers say that so far , the Postal Service has largely distinguished itself during the crisis by : <p>  --  Guaranteeing overnight delivery and accepting all packages  --  it must under its government mandate  --  even as other swamped carriers have declined to do so . <p>  --  Extending hours well into the evening at some locations and making Sunday delivery of priority mail . <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with the flood of mail , the Postal Service has added 2,700 temporary employees . " For us , it 's like Christmas in August , " says Nicholas Barranca , postal vice president for operations support . <p> Many consumers and small businesses are contending with longer lines at the post office . Those shipping more than four packages must make appointments at one of about 400 special drop-off centers nationwide . <p> That means some shippers , especially in rural areas , must drive long distances . Meanwhile , many customers in metropolitan areas have been unable to get appointments on the day they want . <p> Experience pays <p> Overall , though , postal officials say the service has handled the torrent with relative ease , thanks to its huge infrastructure and experience dealing with much larger volumes during the holidays . <p> " We think America is understanding of this situation and all customers are appreciating what we 're able to do , " Saunders says . <p> Business owners forced to use the Postal Service are giving it mixed reviews . <p> Clothing retailer J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day to the post office 's Priority Mail , and operations manager Arthur Cinader Jr . says service has been " excellent . They have made all pickups on schedule and we 've gotten a glowing response from our customers that things are working as well or better . " <p> Bruce Nicklin , owner of computer parts distributor Netseller , is a UPS customer who switched to the Postal Service . Nicklin says his shipping costs have increased 30% to about $ 950 a week for shipments over 5 pounds . <p> But Nicklin says it 's worth it . While his competitors are scrambling trying to find someone to deliver their products , Nicklin 's customers are able to get their shipments . <p> In fact , Nicklin says he 's seen a 20% increase in business from companies that are n't able to get parts from other distributors . <p> Not all are eager converts , though . John Jameson , owner of a Chicago company that makes tents and canopies , sends out 25 packages a week . He has tried to use other shipping companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I try to come to the post office as little as possible . " Jameson says . " I do n't have the time to spend here standing in line . " <p> Holding back <p> Ron Smith handles the shipping department of Audio Exchange , a stereo and electronics business in Chicago . The company has been using UPS almost exclusively to deliver products to customers . " We 're holding back anything that is n't urgent , " Smith says . " The post office is about three times as slow to get to the same destination . So we have n't been using them much at all . " <p> But Debra Hawkins , a spokeswoman for the Postal Service in Chicago , says the Postal Service is showing it can do the job . And , she says , it may be winning new customers . " Customers can see that when times are tough , the Postal Service can deliver . Since the strike , we have been getting a lot more compliments . " <p> Contributing : Dennis Cauchon , Keith L.
