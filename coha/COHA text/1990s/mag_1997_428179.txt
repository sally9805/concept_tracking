Yes , Backyard Barbecues Too <p> In July , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) issued new clean air rules designed to cut the levels of smog and soot in the air . Ever since the rules were proposed back in November , the agency has come under attack . Critics  --  mainly from industry  --  said the rules could impose serious burdens on American consumers , possibly forcing them to give up their backyard barbecues or gas-powered lawnmowers as areas struggle to cut air pollution . <p> EPA administrator Carol Browner scoffed at that notion . " I am disappointed that some have chosen to distort this important discussion by raising distracting and misleading pseudo-issues like banning backyard barbecues , ' " she told a Senate panel earlier this year . " By focusing on the large ( industrial ) sources we can go a long way towards meeting these standards , " she said recently . <p> Environmentalists echoed Browner 's point . Frank O'Donnell , executive director of the Clean Air Trust , told the Bangor Daily News that talk about backyard barbecues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of exaggerating the cost of proposed regulations . But a growing body of evidence suggests that consumers across the country will likely have to change their lifestyles if the areas they live in are to meet the tougher new air quality standards . Past efforts to cut pollution have focused on industry , and industry has gone to great lengths to clean up its act . In many areas , that has left individuals as the main polluters  --  people who drive cars and motorboats , use gas-powered lawnmowers , burn wood in fireplaces , and so on . <p> Indeed , some communities already ban fireplaces , regulate lighter fluid , encourage car-pooling , require clean-fuel cars  --  all in an effort to meet existing clean-air standards . The EPA itself has tried to impose mandatory car-pooling rules on some communities . And it 's pushing emissions rules for lawnmowers , leaf blowers , and other consumer products to cut pollution . <p> Consumers will pay in another way : Even if the rules only saddle power plants , factories , and other industrial contributors to air pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher utility bills and prices on products made by these companies . ( See sidebar , at page 22 . ) <p> The new EPA rules seek to cut the levels of two pollutants : ozone and " fine particulate matter . " The first is the chief component of urban smog . The fine particulate matter consists of microscopic particles , which in the official jargon are called PM 2.5 . The number reflects the size of the particle measured in microns . According to the EPA , current levels of these pollutants pose serious risks to human health . ( But this is controversial ; see " How Deadly Is Air Pollution ? " CR , February 1997 . ) <p> Critics of the new rules have argued that they will seriously affect the lives of many consumers . It 's a point even some in the Clinton administration admit . " Control measures needed to meet the standards could ... require lifestyle changes by a significant part of the U.S. population , " notes Frank Kruesi , an official at the Transportation Department , in written comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn that in California , for example , " nonattainment areas could be faced with economically strangling restrictions to daily operations , including motor carrier operational controls , additional alternative-fuel fleet requirements , zero-emission vehicle mandates , and others . " <p> People Are Polluters . To be sure , nobody knows exactly how these new rules will affect communities . The EPA 's Browner says it will be years before the new rules are implemented . Over that time unforeseen technological developments might aid the clean-up without major disruption . But it 's hard to argue that the lives of average Americans wo n't be affected . After all , in many areas , that 's where the pollution is coming from . <p> " Most of the gains to date have been achieved by imposing very effective , but costly , regulations on big companies  --  utilities , oil refiners , auto manufacturers , steel producers , and the rest , " says Alan Krupnick , a senior fellow at Resources for the Future , an independent environmental research group in Washington . " More promising targets for reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lawns , " Krupnick says . <p> In some areas , industry is no longer even the leading polluter . Krupnick notes that in Baltimore , Md.  --  a " severe " ozone polluter , according to the EPA  --  motorboats and lawn mowers alone contribute more to the city 's smog problem than all its industry combined . " That 's a startling example of the distance that industrial controls have gone , " Krupnick says . <p> In smog-choked Los Angeles , cleaning up industry and cars wo n't do the trick , either . In fact , if nobody drove in the Los Angeles area at all , it would still violate today 's federal clean air standards , to say nothing of tougher ones . Other sources  --  small businesses , water heaters , boilers , gas stations , restaurants , consumer products  --  will have to be targeted , too . <p> " With 14 million people in an area , there are a lot of small sources that add up to a significant amount of pollution , " says Bill Kelly , a spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles air pollution issues for the Los Angeles area . " We 've got to cut emissions about 50% to meet current standards , so we 've got to get everyone to pollute less . " The District has already taken steps along those lines . In 1990 , for example , it required reformulated barbecue lighter fluids . <p> According to the EPA , lawnmowers , leaf blowers , motorboats , and the like are big polluters . While there are far fewer of them than cars , they tend to spew out more pollutants when used . For example , running a chain saw for one hour is the equivalent of driving 200 miles . Running an outboard motorboat for an hour pollutes as much as driving 800 miles . EPA data also show that major sources of fine particle pollution are not factories , but fireplaces , roads , agriculture , and natural sources . <p> A report from state and local air pollution control offices , called STAPPA and ALAPCO , lists many ways states might try to change consumer behavior to cut pollution . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mandated car pooling , new kinds of household paints , restrictions on fireplaces , wood stoves , coal-fired appliances , motorcycles , etc . <p> In addition , the report notes that many small businesses could be targeted  --  including gas stations , boat manufacturers , dry cleaners , bakeries , and auto repair shops . <p> Existing Efforts . Many areas in the country have already started to look to individuals in their effort to meet today 's federal pollution rules . Fireplaces have become a big target in some areas . Burning wood spews out particulate matter , and if enough homes are stoking fires , an entire area can be thrown out of compliance . <p> In the Denver area , for example , it 's illegal to put an old-fashioned fireplace in a new home . Homeowners ca n't burn wood on high-pollution days . Residents of Albuquerque , N.M. , can be jailed for up to 90 days for burning wood on high-pollution days . The Sacramento Bee reported recently that " many Northern California air regulators are eyeing fireplaces as one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Several states and local governments require companies with fleets of cars to meet strict goals on the percentage of alternative-fuel vehicles , or AFVs , in their fleet . In Texas , 90% of cars bought for fleets of more than 25 vehicles will have to be AFVs by year 2002 , according to the Department of Energy . <p> In January , Maricopa County , Ariz. , approved a list of 61 measures designed to help the county comply with current federal air rules . Among them : tougher vehicle-emission tests , voluntary scrapping programs for older cars , gas-powered lawnmowers , and garden equipment . Another recommends that car dealers start cars on their lots only every other week . Longer-range plans included boosting mass transit , synchronizing traffic lights , and efforts to try to locate jobs and homes near each other , so the time people spend commuting would be cut . The plan also included measures to cut air pollution from farming activity , which were postponed in response to pressure from rural governments . <p> " The new plans are needed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particulate pollution , " noted an article in the Arizona Republic . But , the article continued , county officials were unsure " whether the entire laundry list of 61 measures would be enough to bring the Valley into compliance . " <p> Several communities now announce " ozone action days "  --  summer days when the ozone level threatens to exceed federal standards . They typically ask people to change their behavior voluntarily to cut down on pollution . Drive less , do n't cut your lawn or use charcoal lighter fluid , do n't paint with oil-based paints , postpone refueling your car  --  these are typical requests . <p> But faced with tougher ozone rules , some communities might decide they ca n't rely on people 's good will . " It 's possible that some of the things we ask people to do voluntarily could become mandatory , " says Ronald Roggenburk , manager of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission 's air quality program . <p> Local Concerns . If the EPA is n't worried about the potential cost of these new rules , state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to toughen air pollution standards , many issued stern warnings . <p> Salmon , Idaho , Mayor Stanley Davis noted that : " If our calculations are correct , this city will go bankrupt trying to bring itself into compliance , especially in light of the fact that variables , such as forest fires , inversions , etc. , will not be included in the formula . " <p> " As a small rural community , " he said in a letter to members of the state 's congressional delegation , " we simply can not afford to pave every street and alley , ban every wood stove , and whatever else we would need to do to come into compliance . " <p> In a letter to the EPA , West Memphis , Ark. , Mayor Al Boals noted that : " If West Memphis were leveled , with not one speck of industry left , just a barren cotton field where our thriving community now stands , we would still be out of attainment under the new standards . " <p> Mike Waugh , deputy air pollution control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rules could bring harm to residents there . Many homes in the Sierra foothills are heated solely with wood . " Natural gas is not available , electricity is expensive , and the money is just not there for folks to replace their current woodstoves with cleaner-burning woodstoves , " he says . The tougher air pollution rules could force homeowners to buy new woodstoves , which can cost $2,000 . " Who 's going to pay for that ? " <p> Other areas worry that the new rules could hamper development . " Whenever development occurs , obviously more highways have to be built to serve those areas along with more infrastructure , more businesses and jobs , and all of that development may be limited by being in nonattainment , " says Diane Shea , a lobbyist with the National Association of Counties . <p> EPA Moves . And , while the EPA says that it wo n't require car pooling or enforce other consumer-oriented restrictions under the new rules , it 's already doing so under the existing ones . In March , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and garden equipment . The new rules are designed to cut emissions by up to 40% beyond the first phase of regulations . <p> Maryland lawmakers , meanwhile , defied the EPA by voting to scuttle a new car-inspection mandate . The EPA had told the state that it must use an " enhanced inspection and maintenance " system to test car emissions . " Maryland would be subject to the ( Clean Air ) Act 's economic sanctions " if it blocked the mandate , said Michael McCabe , regional EPA administrator . The state stood to lose some $100 million in highway funds , McCabe warned . <p> Maryland lawmakers were responding to driver complaints about the new tests , which they said took too long and damaged some cars . Maryland Gov . Parris Glendening vetoed the bill , meaning the federal mandate will take effect . <p> Meanwhile , Virginia has battled with the EPA over several clean-air proposals . In one , the EPA wanted to force the state to switch from emissions tests done at any certified gas station to centralized tests . More recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force 12 Northeastern states , including Virginia , to adopt the same emissions standards on new cars sold in the region as are imposed in California , an area with a smog problem far worse than the mid-Atlantic region . A federal appeals panel agreed , saying that the " EPA 's rule does not respect the states ' independent authority ; it removes it . " <p> Virginia 's Secretary of Natural Resources , Becky Norton Dunlop , thinks the EPA should hold off on the new rules . " Why not get everyone in compliance with the current standard before moving the goal line ? " she says . <p> The EPA has also tried to force some communities to adopt mandatory car pooling . " We went to battle with them over employer-based trip reduction programs , " says Wayde Buchanan , chair of the Regional Air Quality Council in Denver . He says the EPA 's plan was too rigid and costly . <p> Even the EPA 's Browner now seems willing to admit that more than just big industry will be affected . " Everyone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said the day the rule went into effect . Maybe so , but lawsuits are already being prepared by industry challenging the rules . And lawmakers are likely to vote to block them . That would be doing consumers a big favor .
