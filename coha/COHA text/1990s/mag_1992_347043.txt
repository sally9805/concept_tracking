TITLE : ANNA KARENINA <P> AUTHOR : MUSIC BY DANIEL LEVINE ; BOOK AND LYRICS BY PETER KELLOGG <P> WHERE : BROADWAY <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Tolstoy 's masterpiece becomes a stage equivalent to TV 's Masterpiece Theater . <P> Anna Karenina makes the case for the smaller-scale musical . It is a modestly produced chamber piece , with a minimal set and an orchestra of seven . What is right with the show all involves just one or two people , notably the first fine rapture of the title character 's illicit infatuation with Count Vronsky and the pathetic disillusionment that sends her to her grim fate . What is wrong could not be fixed by any amount of dressing up . Anna is an earnest , intermittently moving but never quite thrilling stage equivalent to PBSs Masterpiece Theater  --  lovely gowns , precise elocution and ballroom dancing , with a stately pace , wayward comic intrusions and scant urgency . <P> Composer Daniel Levine , who has never written a musical before , has yet to develop a distinctive sound : there are stylistic echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wistfulness is genuine enough in the title character 's Act I showstopper , I 'm Lost . Levine 's writing partner , Peter Kellogg , also a beginner , deftly focuses the story on Anna 's forced choice between romantic love for Vronsky and maternal love for her child by her husband Karenin . But Kellogg nearly wrecks the enterprise with lyrics so blandly generic that they convey hardly any specifics of character  --  especially frustrating when the source , Tolstoy 's novel , provides some of the most vivid characters in world literature . <P> Director Theodore Mann and choreographer Patricia Birch , who staged the musical sequences , make remarkably rich use of a nearly bare stage . Ann Crumb , who starred in Aspects of Love in London and on Broadway , makes modest Anna 's eruption into passion completely believable and is deeply affecting in her final derangement . Surrounding her are exceptional men : Gregg Edelman as the hapless gentleman farmer Levin , Scott Wentworth as a reckless but wholly admirable version of Vronsky and , most striking , John Cunningham , who overcomes caricatured writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongheaded and , in his way , as doomed as his desperate spouse .
