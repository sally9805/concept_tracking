<p> Piedmont , Ala. - A rectangle of bare earth marks the site of Goshen United Methodist Church , where generations of good country people have baptized their babies and buried their dead . <p> Next door , the red brick parsonage stands with weathering plywood boards over its windows . <p> At Christmastime , Goshen , now meeting in the local Masonic Hall , is celebrating with the rest of Christendom . But here the carols are sung with particular poignancy and the candles are lighted with trembling hands . <p> This is a community whose faith has been tested and proven strong . <p> On Palm Sunday , just as the children of the church were performing a pre-Easter program , a murderous tornado swept the church into a pile of rubble and took the lives of 20 people from its pews . Another 40 were hospitalized . <p> Vestiges of the disaster remain . Leg braces , walking canes and limps are conspicuous . Other scars are invisible . There will be fewer places around holiday tables today and fewer gifts under many trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less obvious . <p> " I learned when my father died in 1983 that holidays were not going to be the same , " said the Rev. Dale Clem , husband of Goshen 's pastor , the Rev. Kelly Clem . " You 're a different person , a different family . " <p> The Clems will take their daughter , Sarah , 3 , to Disney World after Christmas . Chances are Sarah may ask , as she often does on trips , whether they are going to see her sister , Hannah , 4 , who was killed by the storm . <p> Recently , Sarah has blossomed , her father said . <p> " I think in grief you wonder , ' Am I ever going to be happy again ? ' " he said . " It 's been good to see her come around . That gives me reason to be happy , too . " <p> In the hours after the storm , when survivors and religious skeptics asked the tough question of why God would allow a storm to kill worshipers - including children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Kelly Clem said to the microphones of television reporters , " I do n't think ' why ' is the question right now . We just have to help each other through it . " <p> Some eight months later , she wants to explain her words . <p> " I did n't want people to panic , to fall apart at the scene , " says the young mother , in an earnest voice reminiscent of actress Sandy Duncan . " There was rescue to be done . My concern was , ' Let 's get through this . ' " <p> Now , she said , " I 'm still living with the questions . But I can live with the questions . There are some things in this life we 'll never understand . " <p> God did not cause the tornado to hit the church , she said . " The God I believe in would not cause suffering . " <p> She says she thinks the notion that children should not die may be peculiarly American . " We think children should be protected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's part of life , too . " <p> Although she said she has no anger at God , Kelly Clem said she does feel anger at the Civil Defense system that failed to notify the community adequately of the dangerous storm . <p> " That 's anger that maybe can get channeled into getting things done , " she said . <p> Action , her husband said , may bring some feeling of redemption . <p> " It 's not helpful to say ' why me ? , ' " he said , " but ' what now ? ' What we want so badly is life like we had before , but that 's not possible . So what do we make of life now ? " <p> Mary Woods is asking the same question . In response , she is remaking her life . <p> Mary , 38 , tall and curly haired , leans noticeably to the right as she walks . She lost her husband and daughter in the storm and spent 73 days in the hospital herself recovering from extensive injuries to her lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " and pins and screws in my knees . " <p> Mary was in the hospital when her husband and daughter were buried . As she was leaving the memorial garden for the first time after her release , she saw a rainbow in the sky . " That was for me , " she said . " I knew I would be OK . . . . I have faith God left me here for a reason . He 's going to use me in other people 's lives . " <p> Mary , now the single parent of her 13-year-old son , Marcus , is considering giving up her job at the Farmers and Merchants Bank , owned by her family , and going back to college . She would like to be a social worker , a high school guidance counselor or a worker in a nursing home , she said , " something where I can make a difference in people 's lives . " <p> Mary met Buddy Woods at a high school basketball game when she was 15 . They married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress with a bustle in the back . <p> Life was happy , but not happily ever-after . She took medication for depression and occasionally had " panic attacks . " <p> Ironically , she said , she has not had that trouble since the storm . " I 'm not bitter , " she said . " This is a hand of cards . It 's what you 've been dealt . You can do with it what you will . But God has put a peace and calmness in my life only God can do . " <p> Daughter denied chance to sing <p> Mary was sitting five rows back in the church on the left side facing the altar when the storm hit . Her husband had arrived late , slipped into the pew beside her and told her of a tornado watch . Then the power went out in the church . <p> " All of a sudden glass broke to the left , " Woods recalled . " It sounded like really hard hail . Then it was over just like that . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been in the pulpit area with other children in a play , found his sister 's body near the front of the church under fallen cement blocks . He flicked the broken stained glass off her cheeks . <p> Nine-year-old Amy Woods never sang the song she had rehearsed with the other children of Goshen , " Why Did My Little Lamb Die ? " <p> Their losses , Woods said , have made the people of Goshen more aware of the people they love . On Thanksgiving , she said , she called the housekeeper who had worked for her family as a child and " told her how important she was to me . " Mary still cries when she hears music that reminds her of her husband or daughter . <p> " I got to gut-wrenching sobbing one day . It was communion , " she said . " There 's this guy whose mother was killed in the tornado . He 's in his mid-20s . He got to crying , too . There 's been a bond with him since that day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young man was Shane Molock . His mother , Diane , a nurse , was 42 when she died . <p> During the storm , she threw herself over her young nephew , saving his life . <p> " I would have given my life for Diane 's , " says her mother , Betty Kiser . " It hurts to love - but oh , the joy of loving ! " <p> Edward Kiser , a large , white-haired man who likes to hug , sobs when he recalls the tornado and his daughter . " I do n't cry all for Diane , " he said . " There are so many good friends I lost . . . . And there was n't nothing you could do . " <p> Edward , 70 , grew up in the Goshen church . He met Betty , 63 , when he returned to high school after World War II . They have been married 46 years . <p> Edward was in the back of the church on Palm Sunday . Betty was on the second row from the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edward was thrown against the back wall of the church . He watched the roof collapse and for a few horrible seconds thought only he and one other man had survived . <p> " I was on the front lines in World War II and I never saw anything like that , " he said . <p> Edward managed to rescue a little girl and a 12-year-old boy from the debris . " I stood there and asked the Lord to give me the strength to get him , " he said . " He 's a big boy for his age , but he 's a cute little bugger . " <p> Edward spotted his younger daughter , Lisa Cronin . " Then I had a little bit of peace , " he said . " I said , ' Well , I 've got one alive . ' " <p> It was 10 minutes before Betty was pulled from the rubble . <p> She had ducked between pews when a window broke and was pinned down , unable to move her head or her right side . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Are people going to die from this ? " <p> The reply was , " I 'm afraid so . " <p> At the hospital , a doctor asked whether she was related to Adele Kiser , Edward 's 96-year-old aunt , who had been injured in the tornado . Hospital officials wanted Betty to sign a permission form to amputate her arm and leg . <p> " I asked , ' Does it have to be ? ' " she recalls . " They said , ' To save her life . ' " <p> Betty signed and Adele lost her leg , but her arm was saved and so was she . <p> Six members of the Kisers ' immediate family were in the church - two daughters , a son-in-law , two grandchildren and a granddaughter-in-law - as were numerous members of the extended Kiser family . <p> Diane was killed , Betty spent three days in the hospital , and Diane 's husband , Mark , was injured . <p> " I know this could turn some people away from God , " Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm more determined than ever to do what God would have me do . " <p> " I do n't blame him , " Edward said of God . " I think it was an act of nature and we ca n't control nature . " <p> Goshen people have drawn strength from each other , the Kisers said . <p> " I think our little preacher 's held up better than anybody , " said Edward . <p> A calling to church work <p> Kelly Clem , 34 , has known most of her life that she wanted to " work in church . " <p> After a childhood of frequent moves because of her father 's transfers with the U.S. Agriculture Department , she attended Furman University and Duke Divinity School . At Duke , she met fellow student Dale Clem , who also knew from adolescence that he wanted to enter the ministry . <p> Dale was already working as campus minister at nearby Jacksonville State University when the bishop asked Kelly to take the pulpit at Goshen in 1990 . She hesitated . <p> " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I do n't know whether I was n't sure I could do it , or I was n't sure I would be accepted . " <p> As the first woman minister of the rural church , she did face resistance , she said . " But we got through the hurdles in the first year , and since then I have n't had any trouble in the church . " She has , however , had trouble from outside . Hate mail after the tornado said the storm was God 's punishment on the church for having a woman as its minister . <p> After the tornado hit , Kelly searched for Hannah , who had been in the children 's program . She spotted the fabric she had used to make a costume for her daughter under a large beam . " I kind of knew she was dead , " Kelly said . When rescue workers pulled Hannah out , " she did n't look bad , " her mother said , her eyes moist and her voice soft . " I talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken to the hospital . It was hours before she knew for sure Hannah was dead . Dale was called home from Oklahoma , where he was on a trip with Jacksonville State students . <p> ' This is beyond explanation ' <p> The death of their daughter has caused both Clems to explore new dimensions of what it means to be Christian . <p> " We 've dealt with things we 'd never theologically been concerned about before - life after death , angels , " said Dale . " We were trained to be pretty rational , but this is beyond explanation . " They sense Hannah 's presence with them in songbirds and rainbows , the Clems say . They have dreamed of her , and they know she is happy . <p> On Hannah 's birthday , July 21 , her parents and sister stood on a stump in their backyard and released balloons , one by one , while giving thanks for different aspects of Hannah 's life . They climbed onto the stump because Hannah liked to climb things . <p> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marking time , " her mother said . " It hurts , yet to ignore the pain would deny the grief . " <p> Kelly said she has gained " an awareness of the smallness of life on Earth compared to life before and life after . Part of that is from having come so close to death myself . It has changed me . " <p> She and other Goshen survivors have realized , she said , " that we almost died and it was n't such a bad thing . " <p> Individuals , and the congregation , have been strengthened by their experience , their minister said . <p> A new church - at a cost of about $ 1 million - is in the planning stages . Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been donated from around the country to help rebuild . <p> Church members have a new sense of mission , Kelly said . " People are more concerned about reaching out . We hope to have a day care center in the new church . We hope to have more people use our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentional about looking beyond ourselves . " <p> In her black robe and purple stole , Kelly could hardly stop smiling on the first Sunday of Advent this year . Three children , surrounded by family and friends , stepped forward to join the church . <p> " That was a celebration , " their minister said . " They have been through something so traumatic and they still want to be part of the church . They still believe in God . It 's a look toward the future . "
