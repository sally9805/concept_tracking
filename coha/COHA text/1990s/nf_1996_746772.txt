ENTERING THE FOREIGN SERVICE of Sweden-Norway in 1884 , Sigurd Ibsen , son of playwright Henrik Ibsen , initially im pressed his colleagues as " a great father 's small son . " 1 Only twenty-four years old , and still years away from establishing his own public persona , he had lived most of his life outside of Norway , following his father 's peregrinating footsteps through a self-imposed exile . Growing up in Germany and Italy , he developed a continental outlook . His parents , however , made a point of raising Sigurd as a Norwegian , taking him on numerous trips to Norway , but they continued to live on the continent . In Norway , friends and family were frequently surprised that hc spoke Norwegian so well . In fact , he spoke perfect Norwegian ; but without a trace of dialect , it was too perfect . He was Norwegian , but non-Norwegian at the same time. 2 <p> In 1878 , when Sigurd completed his gymnasium studies in Germany , Henrik thought of returning to Norway so his son could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies would have required that he repeat a year or two . This infuriated Henrik and disappointed Sigurd , who subsequently decided to study in Rome where he completed his law degree in 1882 . " Han er den yngste juridiske doktor i Rom , 22 1/2 ar " He is the youngest doctor of law in Rome , 22 1/2 years old , his father wrote proudly to Bjornstjerne Bjornson , in August , following Sigurd 's successful defense of his dissertation. 3 <p> At a time when his father was in the midst of his most productive period , Sigurd in spite of his obvious intellectual prowess and academic success , remained restless and unsure of his calling . Fulfilling a promise Henrik had made to his son during his studies , Sigurd was given a trip to Paris where he stayed nearly two months in the spring of 1883 . Writing his parents almost daily , he told of visits to museums , salons , and theaters ; all the while , with typical Ibsen exactitude , keeping a careful accounting of his expenses , dutifully reporting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in correspondence with his father in 1880 , during Sigurd 's timc in Paris he began to consider seriously the possibility of a diplomatic career . 5 The itinerant life of a diplomat could , in fact , appear quite attractive to a young man who had grown up intimate with the international milieu and speaking several languages . For a time he contemplated becoming an Italian citizen and entering the foreign service of Italy . Henrik Ibsen , however , hoping to prevent his son 's giving up his Norwegian citizenship , wrote several letters to Norway and Sweden seeking support for an official position for Sigurd . In a letter of 30 November 1883 to Ole Andreas Bachke , an old friend and Minister of Justice in the Norwegian government of Christian Selmcr , he underscored the seriousness of the situation : <p> Sigurd is ready at anytime to enlist in the Italian foreign service . Before this can happen , however , he must be naturalized .... This is a serious matter . Therefore , at my son 's request , I am making this last attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would formulate an assurance or promise on behalf of the government that my son will be considered for the awarding of an attach6 stipend when next one is available .... <p> It was , however , not until after a meeting with the new Norwegian prime minister , Johan Sverdrup , in July 1884 , that Sigurd received word he had been offered a position with the Consulate Office in the Department of the Interior . At the same time , he was notified that he would be given an attache position with the foreign service in Stockholm , a position he began in March , 1885. 7 <p> Although greeted skeptically by his new colleagues and staying in Stockholm less than a year , Ibsen quickly won admiration for his intellect , if not support for his ideas . It became increasingly apparent to him that Norway was perceived by his Swedish colleagues as an inferior parmer in the Union , if not a conquered nation . Their refusal to acknowledge Norway as Sweden 's equal in the Union , Ibsen appeared to take as a personal affront . Hc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , his Swedish colleagues were given orders not to talk politics with him. 8 In so far as the issue of Norwegian equality surfaced during Ibsen 's brief tenure in Stockholm , it appears to have been based on his having taken personal umbrage at the expressed attitudes of Swedish superiority . Following two years in America , however , with new experiences in a country with very different assumptions from those which prevailed in Europe , Ibsen 's understanding of the Norwegian-Swedish Union and , indeed , of the nature of politics itself , would be inalterably affected . In his observations on American society , Sigurd Ibsen reveals , in his correspondence , an increasing sensitivity to , and a growing philosophical consciousness of , such issues as equality and fairness . It is , perhaps , not surprising that these issues would become central to him when , upon his resignation from the diplomatic service in 1890 , he began to propagandize for a new Norwegian role in the Union with Sweden. 9 <p> Sigurd Ibsen 's stay in the United States lasted two years . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , DC , but also traveled widely , from New England to Florida . He engaged , somewhat reluctantly , in the social life of the diplomatic corps around the American capital and occasionally , not surprisingly , feuded with his Swedish colleagues at the Legation . To his parents , he wrote regularly between two and three letters per month . To his father , he generally wrote about his work , social conditions , and , not infrequently , included an accounting of his expenses . Letters to his mother focused on more personal matters , the weather , his health , his diet , and how he was feeling . In the course of the voluminous correspondence , this child of Europe , skeptical though he was of the democratic society in America , came to understand it without becoming an ardent supporter of it . The contradictions he observed between thc popular professions of democracy and equality on thc one hand and the reality as evidenced by relations between Blacks and Whites on the other , he tells his father in October 1886 , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , however , Ibsen found praiseworthy . Overall , a remarkable portrait emerges from an individual who was widely read in world literature , who posscssed intellect and insight as well as a broad range of experience from contacts in Europe which , through his famous father , had brought him into the homes of the nobility as well as the company of royalty . As dose knit as the Ibsen family ( Henrik , Suzannah and Sigurd ) was , one can also speculate that the impressions and attitudes expressed by Sigurd during his diplomatic sojourn in America would probably not differ greatly from those of his father . Knowing and understanding what Sigurd thought and believed , may add insight into some of the ideas and thinking of his father as well . <p> Before leaving for America , Ibsen visited his parents in Munich . From there he contacted H. L. Brakstad , an author and literary critic , in London , asking for assistance in arranging an English language teacher who could tutor him for a month before leaving for the United States . 11 Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having earned a grade of " meget godt " very good in a middle school exam , it was a measure of his desire for perfection and probably an accompanying lack of self-confidence which led him to hire a tutor. 12 <p> Ibsen arrived in New York aboard the Umbria after what seems to have been an eventful voyage . Thirty hours behind schedule due to a storm off the coast of Ireland , New York greeted the newcomer with a fresh blanket of April snow . From Pennsylvania station , Ibsen telegraphed his parents of his safe arrival then strolled along Broadway , " ... som dog ikke forekom mig sa livlig som de 1ondonske hovedgader " ... which did not appear to me as lively as the main streets of London , he later wrote. 13 He arrived in Washington , DC after a nine-hour train ride . There he took a room in the Willard Hotel before finding his way to the Swedish-Norwegian Legation where he was warmly greeted by the two senior diplomats , Count Gyldenstolpe and A. Reuterskiold . <p> Ibsen found a tastefully decorated room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what he called the city 's " most fashionable quarter . " Here he paid $46.00 per month for the room and a daily breakfast consisting of coffee , bread , butter , and two eggs . His letters , especially those to his mother , frequently made reference to how well he ate and how often . Settling into a routine , Ibsen initially spent five hours a day in the legation office , from noon to 5:00 and then he would have dinner at the Metropolitan Club , which he called " a meeting place for diplomats and gentlemen of American society . " He noted , " Washington minder mig adskilligt om Kristiania , isaer om Karl Johansgade og kvarternerne udover Homansby og Hogdehaugen ; men med hvert skridt Mindcr man dog , at man er i en fremmed Verdensdel ; thi en tredjedel af befolkningen bestfir affarvede " Washington reminds me considerably of Kristiania , especially around Karl Johan street and the areas beyond Homansby and Hogdehaugen ; but with every step , one is reminded that this is a foreign part of the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he considered the city to be generally provincial , without theaters or places of entertainment , he found the people to bc " exceptionally lively ' ' and " amiable . " It was apparent that he was beginning to feel more comfortable when hc wrote that Washington , with its villas and gardens , its numerous parks , its wide empty avenues , possessed " an aristocratic character " 15 The informal , democratic forms he observed between people , however , were strictly limited to the white population : <p> The colored population remains a focus of contempt , which we in Europe do not even show to the most wretched proletariat . Not only the Negroes and mulattoes , but also the quarterbloods and absolutely everyone in whose veins a drop of African blood flows is , at birth , denied access to society and , for the most part , condemned to the lowest stations like dish washers , drivers , barbers , shoc shiners , cargo handlers , and coal shovelers , etc . <p> By the summer of 1886 , Ibsen had become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Reuterskiold , his name appeared in the Washington Evening Star as one of the guests . He appears to have developed a special rapport with the Spanish diplomatic corps , as evidenced by his receiving an invitation to attend a soiree at the residence of the Spanish ambassador , where he met the American general Philip Sheridan , a hero of the Civil War . Sheridan , Ibsen noted , was " ... en bitte liten mand med en umadelig mave " a very short man with an enormous stomach . 17 On 20 June , he attended a diplomatic reception at the White House hosted by President Grover Cleveland and his new wife . The diplomatic representatives filed by the First Couple as the Secretary of State made introductions . Ibsen wrote that , in the formal atmosphere , " no words were exchanged . " 18 When words were exchanged at diplomatic gatherings , Ibsen seems to have imptossed everyone favorably with his ability as a raconteur and his wide reading . The Washington Post carried a brief notice about him in its society column on 3 December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attache of the Swedish Legation , is rated as the bookworm of the diplomatic circle , although he is fond of society and a favorite in social ranks . His father is a noted Scandinavian poet . Mr. Ibsen joins to his high degrcc of mental culture a singularly shy and quiet temperament , but is a charming and entertaining talker. 19 <p> Ibsen 's diplomatic contacts were clearly widening , and he was pleasantly surprised when approached by the secretary of the Brazilian legation , asking for his father 's autograph . Pride , undoubtedly , caused him to forward the request to his father , who a few weeks later , fulfilled it. 20 In addition , several requests for money were answered , and on occasion , money would bc sent without his having asked for any . Ibsen 's initial salary of $170.00 per month was not always sufficient , and he continued to live relatively frugally even after receiving a $100.00 per month increase . Tobacco , especially cigars , appears to have been his only expensive habit . <p> The legation office , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hc asked his father to subscribe to Aftenposten , Dagbladet or Verdens Gang for him but was pleasantly surprised when his father sent a subscription toPolitikken , a Copenhagen daily , instead . When reviews of Henrik Ibsen 's plays appeared , Sigurd was forwarded copies to read . He received Rosmersholm , published in 1886 , around io December , having already read Edvard Brandes 's review of it . He read the play five times in thc course of a week and wrote to his father : <p> It has overwhelmed me to such an extent , that it is still barely possible for me to collect my thoughts about any topic which in one way or another is not connected to this masterpiece . Ideas and persons from the play blend into my dreams at night . I have never read anything like it . How is it possible ... to present the deepest conflicts , the most complex characters ' burdened souls in such a simple and classical form ? <p> Because his daily life seems to have centered on his work , much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries , dealt with Ibsen 's duties at the legation and the growing personality clashes with Reuterskiold . Ibsen readily admitted to his distaste for the chief of the legation , partly because of his exccssivc love for receptions and dinners , which left most of the work to be done by Ibsen himself but , probably , also because of their Swedish-Norwegian rivalry . In one letter to his mother , Sigurd wrote that he disliked Reuterskiold 's " kortc figurs evig uro , hans naesblaesende stemmen , hans syngende toncfald ... hans lige lidet hjertc som hjerne " 22 short stature , cternal restlessness , nasal voice , singing intonation ... and that his heart was a small as his brain . The reference to his " singing intonation " is , probably , more suggestive of Ibsen 's irritation with Reuterskiold 's Swedish language than any physical impediment . Although it was required of all diplomats in the Swedish-Norwegian service to use the Swedish language in their reports , Ibsen consistently refused to write anything but Norwegian . This insistence had been thc root of his having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued difficulty in Washington . Remarkably , Reuterskiold , himself , eventually gave in and accepted Ibsen 's work in Norwegian to the great consternation of the Foreign Office in Stockholm. 23 <p> As an attache , Ibsen was given two specific assignments while in the United States . He was to research and write reports on the American laws with regard to immigration as compared with the European , while examining , specifically , the impact of immigration on the United States . Secondly , he was to examine the history and current status of American protectionist policies . Ibsen 's letters make frequent reference to the reports and the time he spends writing them . It became clear to him , however , quite early , that he would need to visit other parts of the country if he was to gain any special understanding of either problem . By 3 June , he had formulated a plan which would have taken him to New York , Chicago , Minneapolis , San Francisco , and New Orleans . <p> Although his travel plans in connection with his reports went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York as well as a summer in New England and a vacation trip to Florida . Perhaps because these trips gave him an opportunity to relax , his letters from these places show the reflective side of Ibsen and are among the most interesting which he wrote to his parents during his stay in America . <p> Writing from Lennox , Massachusetts , in early October 1886 , Ibsen gave his father his impressions of life in America as they had developed over six months . Life in the eastern United States was not as different from the Old World as Europeans generally thought , he said . It was , however , clear that he was experiencing a " new society . " 24 He noted that there , nevertheless , remained a plantation aristocracy in Virginia that reminded him of the landed nobility of Europe , and that , although there was no aristocracy in the North , there was " patrician class " which , in appearance , style and behavior , " can compete W'lth the best circles in Europe . " 25 In America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , they strive for equality . <p> The European democratic envy which expresses itself in rudeness or contempt toward those better off is unknown among native-born Americans . Native-born Americans consider themselves as everyone 's equal and can not imagine that others do not see them in the same light . Therefore , they answer politely and speak politely . <p> Politeness , however , had its limits , even in America . Ibsen appeared surprised , if not somewhat amused , at the hostile reaction exhibited in the press towards the perceived anarchists charged with the Chicago Haymarket bombing in May 1886 : " The expressions from the press would do the Norddeutsche Allgerneine Zeitung proud , " he wrote , in reference to the reactionary German newspaper . Socialism , he believed , was not only unpopular in America , it was misunderstood . " De har den ide at enhver er sin egen lykkes smed ; det romanske solidaritetsbrgrepet er dem fremmed " 27 They Americans have the idea that each person makes his own luck ; the Roman concept of solidarity is foreign to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his father , appeared to him to be of little interest to most Americans , as he wrote : <p> Women issues suffrage in its present form had its origin in America , but I have the impression that no one here either works as energetically for the matter 's resolution as they do in England or discusses the matter as eagerly as they do in Norway . <p> In Europe , the United States had already developed a reputation as the " land of advertising . " Ibsen , however , said that he had not noticed any particular difference between America and Europe . Paris and London , he claimed , were far more cluttered with advertising than New York : <p> I have , admittedly , only strolled up and down Broadway twice , but this famous street appears to me quiet and peaceful when compared with the arteries like Oxford Street or the great boulevards . Unlike Paris or London , hcre building walls and buses are not plastered with advertisements . I think that P. T. Barnum has been accepted as typical , when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , he told his mother , in a letter written shortly after the New Year , 1887 , had a cosmopolitan population , but its architecture was provincial . Buildings , he wrote , were simply three-story structures , but the people who lived in and around them spoke a complicated babel of languages . The Scandinavian languages were heard , but more common were Italian , German , Russian , Polish , or Bohemian , he wrote . The stores in New York , he found to be " marvelous ; ' the restaurants , he claimed were " elegant ; ' but the theaters were " one-dimensional " with their emphasis on English comedies and musicals . In America , Sigurd Ibsen discovered a culture that had not yet become fully developed , at least by standards as he understood them . <p> In February and March , 1887 , Ibsen traveled by train from Washington to Jacksonville , Florida , a trip which took twenty-five hours . Passing through Charleston , South Carolina , he said he thought of Peer Gynt ; while in Florida , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy . Here , too , he was confronted by the harsh reality of the official segregation laws , as he told of Blacks being denied entrance to streetcars , theaters , and restaurants . In Jacksonville , however , he was able to relax on the terrace of the Hotel Windsor while listening to a house orchestra play . A ninety minute train ride took him from Jackson-ville to St. Augustine , the oldest city in North America , and the Hotel San Marcos , where he enjoyed the luxury but feared it was an expense he should not allow himself.3 degrees <p> Returning north , he stopped in Richmond , Virginia , the former capital of the Confederacy , where he noted the first anniversary of his departure from Munich in a place he had " not even heard of one year earlier : " <p> I do not know what it can be , but Richmond 's empty streets reminds me of Rome . The city is built on seven hills , it has a past , a golden age , which will never come again  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attractive in the section with small white villas behind cypress trees and junipers , where Virginia 's aristocracy , once the most elegant in the Union , has sought refuge .... In this western Faubourg Saint Germain , the old rebel-aristocracy broods over the changing times . <p> Receiving the letters from their son in America , Henrik and Suzannah Ibsen experienced America with him . Georg Brandes later told of being present when one of the letters arrived . The elder Ibsen 's hand , he later said , would shake so profoundly in anticipation , that he could hardly open the envelope . 32 After having received the letters telling of his son 's southern vacation , Henrik inquired ifSigurd would publish an account of the trip . Not just a father 's fond appreciation is revealed in the question , but also a judgment of the quality of his son 's writing . Sigurd 's reply , however , revealed an aspect of his personality which one finds nowhere else in his correspondence or his published writing : an uncertainty about his own ability and the imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary aptitude probably went more in the direction of analytical essays , rather than the " reproduction of travel impressions ; ' but whatever ambitions he might once have had to be an author seemed to him , unrealistic . He had ideas or thoughts , he told his father , but did not have an essential ingredient for any modern author-a rooting in a specific milieu , in that society where persons move and live , in those surroundings that make characters and individual actions understandable . <p> Should he write at all , Ibsen said , he would likely put his characters into an Italian setting , but his time in Italy had been too short and his life there too uninteresting to be able to give any picture of Italian society . The same , hc believed , was the case with Norwegian , German , and American society . Ibsen felt that he had moved too much from one society to another , that he was really at home nowhere : <p> In many ways it can be an advantage to be cosmopolitan , but for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true with literaturc and politics . The rcality of it is in the air . The last half of our century is realistic . In literature , one must present thc conditions of everyday life , real people , people one recognizes , who can be touched and felt . Politics , too , builds on historical assumptions and is based on national idiosyncrasies . In literature , we call the direction naturalism , in politics , it is the national . They are merely two expressions of the same thing , our century 's sense of reality . A politician these days must have local roots . I am absolutely certain that I would have had the opportunity to play a role in Norwegian politics if I , at this instant , instead of being a doctor of law or an attache had been a school teacher in Finmarkcn or a church singer in Sondmorc . <p> The correspondence does not reveal Henrik 's response to Sigurd 's heartfelt self-analysis , but one can speculate that hc felt a tinge of personal pain upon reading what his son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parochialism of Norway , he had moved his family from Norway and denied his son the chance to develop roots in a national community . Sigurd had been protected and well educated , to be sure , but growing up without a permanent home , he had no sense of place . That he would name America as an example similar to Germany and Italy speaks volumes for the loneliness he must have felt in these countries . Even Norway , a country which he knew best of all of course , was a land foreign to him in many ways . He had many acquaintances there but no friends . He was Norwegian by birth and apparently wanted to be Norwegian , but hc had never had the opportunity to become Norwegian . He was neither a teacher in Finmarken nor a church singer in Sondmore . It is ironic that much of the moving that Henrik and Suzannah did was directly related to their concerns for Sigurd and his formal education and that precisely those concerns which had led to the creation of the dilemma for Sigurd as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> That Sigurd had an incisive mind and talent as a writer is clear from his letters , the reports he wrote , and the essays he would subsequently publish . It is , however , something of a tragedy that he seemed to feel that any talent he had in that regard had to be channeled as his father 's had been or it could not be exercised at all . In 1887 , uncertain of his future as he was , he had yet to find his own voice . The time he spent in America , however , was important for Sigurd personally and professionally . Those years allowed him to develop independence from his father 's strong presence , and they confirmed in him that he was a European , but , perhaps , most importantly , that hc was Norwegian . That realization , although he was not fully aware of it at the time , would prove decisive for his future . His diplomatic experiences and the resulting attitudes he developed  --  particularly a broadened view of the meaning and significance of egalitarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 1890s . In 1887 , however , he was still searching and , although he might have been out of his father 's shadow physically , he remained too intimidated by him and too close to him to see that he did not have to be exactly like him . <p> Ibsen 's work at the Legation in Washington , DC , developed his selfconfidence in his abilities and helped him to build a better understanding of himself in spite of his uncertainties . His observations of American society , especially the American emphasis on equality , provided him with new insights into the fundamental nature of the Swedish-Norwegian Union . His relationship with his Swedish superiors in the foreign service increased his radicalism and convinced him that Sweden 's unwillingness to accept Norwegian equality was the Gordian knot of the Union conflict . When Sigurd Ibsen sailed for Europe in August , 1888 , he may have been uncertain about his future , but his time in America had brought him closer to Norway and made him a Norwegian .
