My first encounter with a terrible-tempered prehistoric mini-monster was on the slow river that wandered across the farms and woodlots a quarter mile from the crossroads village school , where I puzzled my way through seventh and eighth grades . It was springtime , noon , when another kid and I grabbed our lunches and ran for the river . We knew Mr. Kittredge would be there , as usual , sitting on his homemade stool , fishing . We liked to watch him . " Ketched me a whinger of a green bass , " he said , motioning toward a bankside willow to which a length of binder twine was tied . He 'd strung his bass and laid it in the shallows . As we hurried to look , a shadowy something  --  big as a dishpan  --  seemed to disappear into the deeper water . My friend bent and lifted the stringer . Dangling from it were shreds of flesh and backbone . He thought this was a good joke on Mr. Kittredge , and said , " You sure must have jerked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swore . My friend dropped the fish remains . Kittredge kept swearing , interjecting " Snapping turtles ! " between expletives . Sobered , we sat under a tree and ate our lunch . Mr. Kittredge went back to fishing , cussing intermittently . We could n't resist another look at the mangled fish . We walked to where it lay . The snapping turtle was back . Its head , covered with warty tubercles , was too big to withdraw into its shell , and its beady eyes watched us malevolently . The shell was a mass of mud and stringy green river moss . My friend yelled , and kicked toward it . We did n't know that a snapping turtle 's neck is long , and drawn into the shell in an S-curve . In a blur of motion , the head shot forward like a snake striking , and the horny jaws snapped shut on a piece of his overalls . As we jumped back , the overall leg tore . Kittredge yelled at us to get back from the cantankerous critter . The snapper did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil eyes , still gripping the piece of cloth in its jaws . Snappers are authentic reptiles , kin to crocodiles , alligators , and snakes . They are the hard cases of the turtle tribe , and little changed over the centuries , based on fossil findings that date back about 200 million years . The speed and viciousness with which they strike is indicated by their scientific species name : serpentina . Two snapper species exist in the United States : the common and the alligator . The common snapper ranges east of the Rockies and north to portions of southern Canada . The shell of an average adult measures about 15 inches long . The tail is much longer than that of other common turtles , is heavy at the base like that of an alligator , and has bony plates on its underside . Weights of 10 to 20 pounds are average , and 30-pounds-plus is not rare . One old mossy-backed brute was recorded at 86 pounds . The alligator snapper ranges throughout the South , except on the Florida peninsula . They are larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as 24 inches long , with tail lengths to match . The shell has three rough lengthwise ridges that give the creature the look of a prehistoric monster . And the head may have a circumference of more than 2 feet  --  much too large to be withdrawn into its shell . Specimens of 40 or 50 pounds are common , and numerous 100-pounders have been taken ; the largest known to date weighed 219 pounds . Though less aggressive than the common snapper , the alligator snapper is also extremely dangerous when anything comes within striking distance of its head . I learned to exercise caution in the alligator snapper 's domain when I was bass fishing on a Louisiana cypress slough , guided by a native who was a master at sculling his skiff . Sitting up front , with the short paddle under his right armpit , he steered among the trees and cypress knees . As I hung a lure among the knees , he moved the skiff in close . But when I started to reach my left hand into the water to free the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Startled , I asked , " Why ? " He held up his right hand , which had been gripping the paddle . The third and fourth fingers were missing . " Alligator snapper , " he said . He told me that as a young fellow , he 'd miscalculated when handling a 60-pounder that he 'd trapped for meat . At his house he showed me more evidence of the alligator snapper 's wrath  --  a sculling paddle that he had once used to prod a big snapper , with a chunk bitten out of the blade . Snappers have no real enemies except for man and the terrestrial animals that find their land-based nests and eat their eggs or newly hatched young . A diverse diet of fish , frogs , crayfish , carrion , and aquatic vegetation means snappers are seldom short of food . And when the opportunity presents itself , they also prey on such animals as muskrats and aquatic birds . A country neighbor told me that shortly after stocking a pond with fish and ducks , he found a number of duck carcasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-shore shallows . He did n't know what had killed them . Then one day when bank fishing , he saw a heron that had landed in the far end of the pond begin squawking and wildly flapping its wings . It looked as if its legs were being jerked from beneath it ; then something struck it from one side and it disappeared underwater . " It then dawned on me that I had snapper trouble , " he said . " I built a trap , baited it with fish , and eventually turned a half dozen big snappers into stew meat . " These vicious turtles are well equipped for waylaying , stalking , and killing prey . Their sharp-edged jaws are hooked for tearing flesh , and their eyes are set far forward to enable lethal aim when striking ; those of the common snapper are set so high on their head that they can only be seen from directly above . The alligator snapper even has a protuberance on its pink tongue , which it uses to entice prey , and when fish try to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snappers are found in creeks , large streams , ponds , big lakes , sloughs , and marshes . Much of their time is spent either buried in the soft bottoms , with only their head exposed to watch for prey , or slowly walking along the bottom , hunting . They are not graceful swimmers , and they seldom go ashore except when the female does so to lay her eggs . Snappers have webbed feet equipped with nails . Though their heavy legs are somewhat clumsy , the design of the plastron  --  the underside of the shell  --  allows for more leg movement than the plastrons of most other turtle species . The snapper 's plastron does n't cover the entire underside , but is attached at the sides to the upper shell by narrow strips of shell . Herpetologists suspect that the plastron 's small size , which leaves most of the snapper 's soft underparts exposed , may be one reason for their irascibility . Because of the snapper 's penchant for mud and dense bottom vegetation , adherent species of algae often cover much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its repulsive appearance . Even more intriguing are the bottom-dwelling worms , snails , and other small aquatic creatures that take haven under the edges of the shell . In the northern part of its range the common snapper hibernates during winter , burying itself in bottom mud for several months . Both species spend most of their time submerged . Snappers have been known to stay underwater as long as eight days at a time without resurfacing . They tolerate a low oxygen supply , and are able to absorb oxygen dissolved in water through the tissues of the throat and the lower gut . Breeding takes place in the spring , underwater . Two males occasionally battle for a female , facing each other and striking viciously , while trying to seize and lacerate the neck of the opponent . During mating the male clings to the front and rear edges of the female 's shell with all four feet . Because the chances of males and females meeting are low in some habitats , the female can store surplus sperm from a single mating within her body to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in a hole that the female digs with her hind feet . The eggs are round , and average twenty-five in number . The female covers them with dirt when she 's done laying them . Hatching requires about three months , and the young show the same irascible temperament as adults . They grow slowly , and may have a shell only 3 or 4 inches long when seven years old . The shell is a kind of exterior skeleton that evolved eons ago as a fusion of what would have been ribs and other bony parts . Egg-laying females , I can attest , are as ill-tempered as any male . I met one lumbering toward the water , as I was walking back to my pickup after a day of fishing . We both stopped . She glared at me . I cut down a 1/2-inch-thick green buckeye branch and tapped it on the ground in front of the turtle , which struck it so hard her body raised off the ground . She hung on tenaciously as I lifted the branch until her rear feet barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick in two , plopped back down , but would not give ground . I headed for the pickup to get my .22 rifle . Snappers would decimate our fish , I thought to myself . I had guessed this one at about 20 pounds ; no telling how old she was . Snappers commonly live thirty or forty years , have been recorded upwards of sixty , and some herpetologists believe a few can live to 100 . I grabbed the rifle and loaded it . Suddenly it occurred to me that the harridan might be as old as I was . I unloaded the rifle and put it back in the pickup . What the heck , the lake was overstocked with fish anyway . TASTY TURTLE ENTREES Country folks have been eating snappers since the Colonial days , and it 's surprising how many cookbooks include recipes for them today . If you have the opportunity to cook snapping turtle , here are a couple of recipes you might like . Remove the fat before cooking , as it can give meat a strong taste . * EASY-ROASTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pieces . Sprinkle with salt and pepper , and place in a Dutch oven . In a bowl , combine one 10-3/4-ounce can of cream of mushroom soup with 1 cup of good red wine . Blend well , then add 1 cup of sliced mushrooms and 1 cup of chopped onion . Pour the mixture evenly over the turtle meat , and place the cover on the Dutch oven . Bake at 350 degrees F for about 2 hours . Then test for tenderness . If necessary continue baking , covered , until meat is done . * TURTLE AND VEGETABLE SOUP Cut about 2 pounds of turtle meat into small pieces , and place them in a deep pot . Cover the meat with water , and add 2 teaspoons salt , 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper , and several dashes of Tabasco(TM) sauce . Bring to a boil , reduce temperature , and simmer , adding more water if needed , until meat feels tender . Next , add several stalks of celery , diced ; 1 cup of carrots , cut in pieces ; 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chopped . Add water , as needed , to cover vegetables and meat . Cook until vegetables are tender . SNAPPER REGS Snappers are often trapped for their meat , which is sold commercially in some states . However , game laws regulating the trapping , sale , and consumption of snapping turtles vary across the country , and some states require a license to do so . Colorado has the snapping turtle on the state 's game list , for example , but other states do n't . So check it out before you try snapping one up for yourself . <p>
