From PART ONE : Taking Care of Ourselves // Introduction // By Wendy Sanford , with Nancy Miriam Hawley and Jane Pincus // Revised by Jennifer Yanco and Judy Norsigian for the 1998 edition // This first section of Our Bodies , Ourselves for the New Century offers basic information we as women need to take care of our health at home and in the workplace . Conventional medical care , with its heavy emphasis on drugs , surgery , and crisis intervention , sometimes helps us when we are sick , but it does not always keep us healthy . To a great extent , what makes us healthy or unhealthy is how we are able to live our daily lives : the quality of the food we eat and the air we breathe ; access to health care ; how we exercise ; how much rest we get ; how much stress we live with ; how much we use alcohol , tobacco , or other drugs ; how safe or hazardous our workplaces are ; whether we experience the threat or reality of sexual violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . Many , however , are not ; we can influence them only by working with others to bring changes : pressuring an employer to remove hazards , forming a co-op for cheaper high-quality food , protesting the pollution from a nearby chemical plant , starting a network of " safe houses " for women who may be experiencing domestic abuse . // The resources available to us , especially our financial resources , greatly influence our daily health . In an unjust society , some people can afford to take better care of their health than others . It is a major aim of the feminist movement to make the crucial tools for health and survival available to everyone . // All through this book we emphasize wherever possible what women can do  --  for ourselves , for each other  --  in staying healthy , healing ourselves , and working for change . // HEALTHISM // Healthism , simply put , is an overemphasis on keeping healthy . Many persons today ( particularly the more affluent ) have become preoccupied with staying healthy . We may become preoccupied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we feel powerless to change major factors like the health care system , contaminated water supplies , and toxins in our food and the air we breathe . When we are overly focused on fitness or a " healthy lifestyle " as goals to strive for ( or as the measure of a " healthy " society ) , we deflect attention from the more important goals of social justice and peace . // Even though prevention is crucial , and is dangerously glossed over by conventional medicine , it , too , can be overemphasized . In expanding the concept of prevention ever further , we risk defining more and more aspects of life in terms of health and illness  --  that is , according to a medical model . We may end up seeing exercise , eating , meditation , fresh air , or dance , for example  --  all pleasures in their own right  --  simply as measures of our potential health or nonhealth. in this way , ironically , we further medicalize our lives . // Keeping healthy can also become a moral issue . Individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake their heads disapprovingly over those who " do n't take care of themselves . " In many cases , this amounts to blaming the victim ; it shows a failure to recognize both the social and economic influences on health habits and the complexity of illness . With personal habits , too , a certain tendency to judge creeps in : " She should have more control over her smoking " or " She should get more exercise , stop eating so much sugar . " Even when these are matters of personal choice , a moralistic healthism is inappropriae . And it does n't help people change , even when they may want to . // STRESS // Common to most of the chapters in this unit is an appreciation of stress as a major health factor . Humans , like all animals , have innate stress-alarm systems originally designed to help us fight or run away when faced with danger . In earlier , simpler times , this fight-or-flight response was appropriate . In today 's world , however , the dangers are no longer so obvious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguous stresses ( see box below ) for which immediate action is often impossible . We squelch the fight-or-flight response over and over again in the course of a single day . One commonly expressed theory is that years of failing to discharge the body 's stress response can damage the body 's immune ( disease-fighting ) system and may contribute to different kinds of ill health . // Body image pressures are a huge source of stress for women ; unrealistic internalized notions of how we should look often lead us to try to alter our appearance by doing things that compromise our health . The stress of living under the constant onslaught of racism has serious health consequences that are finally beginning to be seriously examined by the scientific community . As women , we bear the stress of living under the threat of sexual violence  --  on the streets , in our workplaces , and in our homes . Job stress continues to increase as more and more of us are heads of households and have to work longer hours to make ends meet . This , combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stress . Food can be one of the greatest sources of stress : Do we have enough to feed ourselves and our families ? Do we have access to good , wholesome , uncontaminated food ? The extent to which we are able to eat well influences our ability to deal with stress . At the same time , increasing numbers of women and girls suffer from eating problems  --  some of them life-threatening , like anorexia and bulimia . Some of us turn to alcohol , tobacco , and other drugs to help us deal with stress ; these solutions frequently make matters worse for us. // There are many ways to minimize the effects of stress in our lives by taking care of ourselves  --  eating well , exercising , and exploring such things as meditation , holistic approaches to health , psychotherapy , and other approaches to caring for our psychological and emotional health  --  and by enjoying simple pleasures like foot rubs , long hot baths , and time to ourselves . It helps us to complain when we need to , ask our friends for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to . But it is important , too , to try to identify the causes of negative or excessive stress in our lives , and to change as many as we can . // This is n't always easy or possible , especially by ourselves . The following chapters attempt to distinguish carefully between what we can do as individuals and the social factors that we must change by working together . In many cases , the fact of joining together with others to bring about needed change can provide us with the energy and hope that are important sources of health and well-being in and of themselves . // CAUSES AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS // In our culture today , stress is often defined in a simplistic way : stress is working too hard or having a " type A " personality . But the causes of stress are complex and often beyond our personal control . Some Causes of Stress Financial insecurity Job loss Death of somebody we love and/or need Ending or beginning a relationship Job changes or a new job Having a baby Moving Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , sexual orientation , religion , or physical disability An illness for which we can find no appropriate care A diet low in fresh foods and high in sugar , white flour , caffeine , additives , and salt Environmental pollution The threat of nuclear war Stresses Specific to Women A majority of women now combine outside jobs with full responsibility for home and children . In addition , we may feel  --  from others , from ourselves  --  the pressure to be " perfect " at each of these . Most jobs pay women little and do n't allow us to use our abilities . Many women are single parents ; many have low incomes . Some of us are at home all day with small children . We face sexual harassment and abuse on the street , in workplaces , at home . Symptoms of Excessive Stress Headaches Neck , back , and shoulder pains Nervous twitches , " tics " Insomnia Skin rashes Greater susceptibility to colds , influenza , or other illnesses Worsening of existing conditions or illnesses Depression , anxiety , irritability , nervousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cankers , cold sores Stomachaches , diarrhea , loss of or increase in appetite Increased frequency of herpes episodes //
