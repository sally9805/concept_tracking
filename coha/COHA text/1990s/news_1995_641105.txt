<p> Sometime this month , perhaps as early as tomorrow , the U.S. Supreme Court will issue what is expected to be a major decision affecting the school desegregation programs in dozens of American cities , including Denver . <p> It will arrive a little late . Local educational and political leaders of all races and ethnic groups have for some time been in general agreement that no good can come of further judicial involvement in the Denver public school system . <p> The collective experience of the last 25 years has done little or nothing to improve minority student achievement , and the substantial abandonment of the public school system by the white population has had many deleterious effects on housing patterns and prices and slowed the city 's economic growth , to cite just a few obvious effects . <p> In city after city across America , school boards operating under federal court order - as is Denver - have been struggling with the same question . What standard must they meet to end federal jurisdiction and resume local control of the schools ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Denver U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch has before him a pending request from Denver Public Schools ( DPS ) to lift his court order . The judge is clearly waiting for the expected Supreme Court decision in a Kansas City , Missouri case ( Missouri vs . Jenkins ) which may provide him and other district judges some additional guidance in deciding the issue . <p> No two school desegregation cases are exactly alike , of course , so it remains to be seen how helpful the Missouri decision will be to Matsch and others . It depends on how broadly it is worded . One of the issues in the case is whether the courts can require equality of results ( " equal output " ) as measured by student achievement , or find compliance based merely on the provision of equal educational opportunity . <p> The Kansas City case has many surface features that set it apart and make it an extreme example . The district and the state have spent huge sums of money in the process of trying to comply with court orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district has spent $ 500 million on new magnet schools alone , schools that were intended to attract white students from the suburbs . <p> The white students arrived in very small numbers , less than 800 a year . At one point as the city waited for the white students to show up it capped black enrollments in the new magnate schools . In other words , a black student could not be admitted to the new school until a matching white student was found . The result was that schools designed for perhaps 1,000 students operated with only a few hundred wasting tax dollars in the process and denying blacks the benefits of the new facilities . <p> Meanwhile , the district 's attempt to get black students to enroll in the suburbs failed badly . The suburban districts refused to accommodate the transfers and the courts said they could n't be compelled to accept the inner city students . <p> The district ( by the late 1970s 75 percent black ) also spent heavily in other areas , building up the central administration to almost 50 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other state school district . The district loaded up on computer equipment , furnished its new high school with an indoor track and swimming pools and weight rooms , handball courts , and even provided a separate area for the exclusive use of gymnasts . <p> The district court at one point went so far as to order salary increases for nearly all district personnel including the janitors out of some sort of perverse conviction that higher janitorial salaries had something to do with desegregation . The districtwide dropout rate for junior and senior high school , if anything , worsened . It exceeded 40 percent and the daily absentee rate hovered around 30 percent . Achievement test scores , with the exception of the very early grades , failed to budge . <p> Finally , faced with a circuit court decision requiring a continuation of the program , the state said it had enough . It claims the original constitutional violation has been remedied . It argues that it has met the court 's previously announced standards for compliance in that the district has revised student assignments , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities to all , made nondiscriminatory faculty assignments and allocated resources equally among the students . This , Missouri says , should be enough to free it from the court 's jurisdiction and it should not have to comply with the circuit court 's latest mandate of also achieving " suburban comparability " or " desegregative attractiveness . " The first term means achievement results must be comparable to what occurs in the suburbs and the second term encompasses steps designed to lead to future desegregation by attracting back to the city white students who have fled the system . <p> In oral arguments earlier this year Justice Antonin Scalia put the issue starkly by suggesting that if all school facilities and opportunities are equally available " it is not possible " to blame low student test scores on past discrimination . <p> Others on the court suggested that while test scores may not be used as the determining factor they can be considered by the lower court . <p> So in the end the Kansas City case may come down to the question of whether the court is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " enough is enough . " <p> Close students of the history of desegregation will recall that one of the most troublesome aspects of these school cases is the issue of what it takes in a particular district to remove what has been called the " vestiges of past discrimination . " <p> At various times some of the most strident proponents of desegregation have said the vestiges include just about everything , achievement , social status , housing patterns , job opportunities and crime rates . <p> Until all of these factors are in appropriate racial balance , they suggest , the desegregation efforts must continue . The courts have slowly sorted out and discarded most of these claims . <p> In prior cases it has said a district ca n't be held responsible for housing patterns over which it has no control and it has backed away from requiring student assignments based solely on achieving racial balance . The big remaining issue here , as elsewhere , involves how much latitude a local judge has in determining when to let go . In Denver , for example , Matsch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether it would allow the district to resegregate . How is that good faith to be demonstrated ? Assuming the board shows compliance by adopting some attendance policy or other , must it promise never to adjust it in the future ? <p> The question illustrates the high level of frustration this case has produced for educators , parents and students alike . <p> For Denver , as for many other cities , this judicial chapter has been a huge letdown . Just how huge was visible the other day when Mark Stevens , education reporter for The Denver Post , quoted plaintiffs ' attorney Gordon Greiner . <p> It is Greiner who has made something of a life 's work out of the Denver school case since he filed it back in 1969 . <p> Greiner was commenting on the fact that local minority achievement test scores remain about where they were , far behind the scores of white students . In formulating something of a revisionist history , Greiner said the desegregation efforts were n't just about student achievement . " I think that there are other values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are different , the better off everybody is , I think experience helps break down stereotypes It 's friendships . It 's networks . It 's better contacts , " he said . <p> Really ? So here we are at the end game of school desegregation , 40 years down the road in one of the Supreme Court 's most ambitious undertaking in social and educational engineering , and we are told that this unprecedented exercise in judicial power was about " friendship , networks and better contacts . " <p> What began with a bang has seemingly ended with a whimper . <p> Recall the words of the original Supreme Court decision in a Topeka , Kansas case and measure them against Greiner most recent self-serving remarks . <p> The court said : <p> " Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children . The policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group . A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn . Segregation therefore , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system . " <p> Compared by that standard , enunciated 41 years ago , Greiner 's listing of the benefits ( better networks ) must sound awfully hollow to all citizens , whether they be white , black or brown . <p> The best than can be said of them is that they certainly make it possible to imagine a situation in which the local community , freed of federal judicial interference , might do just as well . <p> The city can certainly do something about " friendships , networks , and better contacts " without judicial direction and maybe have a little time and energy left over to worry about educational improvements for its school children . <p> A clear decision in the Kansas City case by the U.S. Supreme Court would be a nice place to start .
