MISSISSIPPI , SUMMER OF 1861 . There was excited talk in the parlor . The Confederacy had just won a great battle against the Federal forces at Manassas , presaging general victory and an early end to the hostilities . General Beauregard was mentioned so often as leader and hero that a little girl who was crawling about on the floor got to her feet and stood firmly before the company . " My name is Beauregard , " she said , and from then on would never answer to any other name . <p> I wonder what people in Carrollton , Mississippi , find to talk about now that just about everybody who remembers Miss Beauregard Somerville has passed away . She herself died many years ago , during the ' 30s , but that in no way stopped her being spoken of as a living presence . <p> I remember the rainy winter evening when we got the news of her death , and my father " went up there . " She lived only a short distance from us , up the street that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is still there , its construction definitely in the grander post-Civil War manner , gables on the roof and bay window in the facade , a wraparound front porch , stained-glass windows . A long concrete walk ran up to sheltered porch steps . The steps from the street were imposing beyond the ordinary , flanked with scrolled cement , like banisters . Elephant ears were always growing in the round plot in the front yard . They spread out their great green fronds , where raindrops would linger , large and white as pearls . You walked softly as you entered the house , minding your manners . You would be judged if you did not . <p> She was not a " Miss " any more than her name was Beauregard . In the South , women are called " Miss " plus their first name even if married multiple times with a flock of descendants . Beauregard was soon shortened to Beaurie , and the Miss attached very early on , I can only imagine . <p> Miss Beaurie was my grandmother 's " best friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born , Miss Beaurie lived on as a supervisory spirit to my mother and , by extension , to us . She dispensed the authority of her approval or disapproval to any she judged worthy of notice : approval was assumed , thus infrequently mentioned ; disapproval was dreaded , and was often called into play . The times were changing ; danger was everywhere . <p> Miss Beaurie was the custodian of manners . She could n't have invented them herself , so she must have got them from those before her who knew best . Wherever the rules came from , the families she accepted had to obey them . All their children and kin came under her surveyance , and were fair game for comment . Was a girl seen uptown without stockings ? " I must speak to Nora , " she would say . " Augusta must nor . go uptown looking like that . " Certain stores faced west and required an extra petticoat for entering in the afternoon . No lady should walk past the barbershop , where common men sat and gossiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a lady smoking , but if she did , watch out Drinking for any woman lay beyond the pale : banishment was the only result possible . <p> My mother related how , as a girl , she was once afflicted with persistent hiccups that went on without stopping for two whole days and nights . The family tried every known remedy : dropping a cold key down her back , sudden scares , swallowing a glass of water while holding her breath . My grandmother was about to call the family doctor , but was inspired to say to my mother : " Beaurie told me what you did . " The hiccups stopped instantly . <p> Did some girl begin to go out with a young man " not of good family " ? The telephone call would come ; the mother or aunt or both would be summoned . Miss Beaurie served tea to her visitors , I believe , or maybe coffee , teacakes as well . I do n't remember vividly , perhaps because I never liked going there . <p> The house did make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , rich wallpapers . The carpeted stairs ran up from an entrance hall into a mysterious upper floor I was never asked to explore . The dining room was on the right , to the left the parlor . This was the best room , I suppose , as there were at least windows , and light coming in . <p> The lady herself sat in her long , black skirts , summer and winter , with her high lace collar and her fan . Long widowed  --  I never heard much about Mr. Somerville , whoever he had dared to be  --  and childless , what she knew better than anything else was exactly how to be Miss Beauregard Somerville . <p> My mother always dressed me carefully for these visits . I had to wear my black patent leather shoes with the single strap that buttoned , my white socks . My dress had to be clean , pressed , starched in summer , and never too short . ( The Keenan girls wore very short dresses ; you could see their panties ; I expect their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were never long enough to come between my bare legs and the horsehair upholstery on the straight-backed chair . I would sit , sternly forbidden to scratch , and wonder how long before we could leave . My feet dangled down with nothing to rest on . <p> I do n't remember Miss Beaurie 's face as well as I wish I could . I remember long vertical wrinkles , a pursed mouth , and gray-black hair with curls across the brow , features whitened with rice powder . I remember feet in neat , black , laced-up shoes , little crooked hands . The high lace collar . The cameo. remember a stream of talk directed at my mother , who always supplied the right answers , the appropriate questions , the expected nods . <p> While my mother all her life professed the greatest admiration and devotion to Miss Beaurie , I do wonder how much of this was what she thought she ought to feel . When we finally paid our respects and left , walking decorously down the front walk to the steps , turning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be just at the door , ready at a precise moment to return inside  --  I remember that once heed , once out of sight , my mother , a young woman herself then , might begin to sing or skip and talk in a carefree way , holding my hand as we went along the sidewalk back home , and laughing at one thing or another . Once by some unaccountable chance we found two kittens by the sidewalk , no houses near . She picked them up as they mewed , put one in each pocket of her coat and took them home . One died ( I smothered it , I think , with affection ) , but the other lived . <p> Miss Beaurie had a car and a chauffeur . She made long trips to Memphis to shop . These took place , I believe , twice a year , and only a chosen one or two of the ladies she regarded highly were asked to go along . I remember the car well , for Miss Beaurie was what is known in Mississippi as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sometimes allowed to be driven in it , along with my mother . " We 'll just drive up to the church together , " was what she said by telephone . I do n't quite recall why we had to go with her . We , too , had a car , though you could never be sure something would n't go wrong with it . It had to be started from the outside with a hand crank and sometimes would not turn over . <p> Once or twice I traveled to Memphis with the ladies in Miss Beaurie 's superior auto , though I also remember trips there with my parents . That auto It must have just missed being a limousine . I believe it had jump seats like old-fashioned taxis . Often I had to sit by one of the ladies . ( I could not ride backwards long without getting carsick . ) One of them wore a fur piece , a black silver-fox fur with its head left in place , wicked glass eyes set in above its narrow snout . The mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the paws were also intact  --  and so to hold the pelt in place . The lady would open and close the mouth , pretending it would bite me . I never liked this . One of the other ladies was a marvel for the long , black line that I observed coming down the side of her mouth . I asked my mother about it and was told she " dipped " but not to mention it . She believed her habit to be- secret , though everyone knew . <p> " Everyone knows it , but do n't mention it . " It was easy for any bright child to see how such a regulation about one thing extended to multiple others . <p> Through the years , stories emerged . The Somerville cousins , girls of a likely age and beauty , came to visit from Oxford during my mother 's girlhood . They came for a " house party " at Cousin Beaurie 's . When I taught at the state university , which is located at Oxford , I became friends with Ella Somerville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Oh , yes , " she recalled , " we were invited for buggy rides with the unmarried young Presbyterian minister . Cousin Beaurie doted on him . I think one of us was supposed to marry him . And of course you knew about the murder . " <p> " Murder " <p> " Why yes , in those days , she would tell about it . You must have heard it . " <p> No , I had n't , but I heard it then . It began like so many stories : It was a dark and stormy night ... <p> Envision for a moment Carrollton , Mississippi , an old town of scarcely five hundred souls , set off from any railroad , any highway . White houses perch on hills surrounded by enormous yards ; crooked roads wind outward from the town square , out from the courthouse , past the jail , churches , law offices , post office , out from shaded walks on the square that go past hardware and drugstores , bank and lodge hall . On a rain-lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to wander around there ? Somebody did . <p> A man , neither young nor old , no kin to anyone , came out of the rain and knocked at a door . It was the side door of the Somerville house . He was asked in . <p> Only Miss Beaurie and her husband were there . She always had <p> cook and a butler , also a gardener and the chauffeur , whose name was Fox . But none lived there , and no one but the two Somervilles was present when the knock came . <p> The nameless man was appreciative and cordial , well-mannered and full of the right things to say . Food was brought him , and dry clothing , and he was invited by these Christian folk to sit and talk . What the talk ran to has not been passed down , but the Somervilles were impressed enough and good-hearted enough to ask him to stay the night . One can know the phrases : " You ca n't go back out in this sort of weather . You 'll be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy pounding of rain on the gabled roof , the rumble of thunder , the shifting pressure of wind . Cozy within , they talked of beliefs so devoutly held , the Bible , the church . Oh , yes , the guest himself , despite his misfortunes , was a believer . The family Bible appeared , and passages of encouragement were read aloud . There were prayers , The Somervilles opened a guest room . How happily they must have gone to bed . <p> But in the night they heard noises from below . The two of them got up and crept down the stairs . Their guest was in the dining room relieving them of the family silver . He was putting it in a sack . Evidently there was enough light to see by , for nothing was done to disturb what he was up to . Their cousin Ella remembered and told me just what it was Mr. Somerville took up for a weapon , but I have forgotten . Maybe a poker A flashlight  --  one of those bold , eighteen-inch-long , nickel-plated monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best of my belief , Miss Beaurie herself held the flashlight and beamed it on the thief at the appropriate moment . With poker or tongs , gold-headed walking cane or whatever was handy , the guest in the house , the unfortunate Christian believer come in from the cold , was bashed in the head and brought down on the dining room floor , cutlery falling all about him , stone dead . <p> I asked my mother if this could possibly have happened as I had it from Ella . She had evinced no surprise or regret . But then it was a long time later . <p> " Oh , yes , " she said , " they hated it mighty bad . Of course , Mr. Somerville never meant to actually kill him . " <p> " But then what happened ? " I pursued . <p> " What do you mean , what happened ? They buried him . " <p> " Was n't there any inquiry , any inquest ? Did n't anybody ever know who he was ? " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was n't from anywhere around here . " <p> " Was n't from anywhere around here . " Key phrases like this extend infinitely into the social order , of no help at all to a nameless stranger . <p> Of the trips to Memphis when I went along I recall less than would like to claim . The ladies talked a great deal , but it was not the kind of talk I was interested in . I do remember Fox , the chauffeur , though . In good weather Fox would efficiently arrange the isinglass windows so that we could get fresh air without being blown apart , If it rained he would halt the car , get out , and snap them all in place . Fox was a well-built , tan-colored man , exquisitely polite and well-trained in helping ladies in and out , in being on time to the second . <p> Memphis , our major shopping town , was all of one hundred thirty miles away on Mississippi roads that into the late ' 30s were completely unpaved . Tennessee had pavement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with relief . In Mississippi there were dust , curves , hills , and tiny towns o pass through . One of these was called Polk . Miss Beaurie had discovered a filling station in Polk with a sandwich shop that made excellent sandwiches . We would select what kind we would like  --  chicken salad or ham  --  and Fox would take the list inside . The sandwiches eventually came out in a bag , each wrapped separately in wax paper , and were distributed . A thermos of iced tea came open . Cups were passed out . These were our " refreshments . " <p> In Memphis we stayed at the Gayoso , which Miss Beaurie for some reason preferred to the Peabody . Hotels to me spoke of adventure , though of what sort at that time I could not say . The lobby was fascinatingly paved in small hexagons of white marble , as was the bathroom . And there were big , white towels and soaps wrapped individually and <p> strange , enticing smell . <p> Underneath all the shopping and talk , I lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass through the revolving doors , go to the desk with whoever asked for our key , mount upward in the elevator , follow the carpeted hallways . Trailing the ladies through the streets from shops to department stores , I ogled window displays and marveled at Mr. Peanut , who strolled about advertising Planters Peanuts . His great helmet was an enormous peanut shell painted . with a face . He wore spats and carried a walking cane . I think my mother took me to the picture show one evening , but I fell asleep . <p> On the way home from Memphis it was understood that Fox was to be granted the favor of going by his sister 's house . She lived in the black section of Memphis , and I remember stopping before a small , low house with a fence around the front yard , and Fox leaving us to sit in the car while he passed within the house carrying a large bundle . " Fox brings presents for his sister , " Miss Beaurie would explain with approval , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children . " The things sent were all in a large box , which Fox deposited in the trunk of the car . I do n't recall that we ever saw the sister . Fox resumed the trip without comment . He was not the talkative kind of servant who invited Questions . <p> Years later it appeared that Fox , season after season , had been running whiskey into the dry state of Mississippi in Miss Beauregard Somerville 's car . <p> When my parents were away , I was sent over from the school to Miss Beaurie 's house to eat dinner  --  " dinner " meant the midday meal . I had to sit at table with her and with her widowed sister , or some elderly relative who was staying there . I answered questions addressed to me . She gave me a fine enough lunch but insisted that I drink hot water out of a china teacup . Some idea of hers made this the perfect thing ; in winter for the digestion . If she said it , you had to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather or cold . Petticoats . Black shoes . High lace collars . And no one to doubt that she was right about everything . <p> She had a greenhouse covered in glass at the side of the house . It was the only one in town . In winter it was nice to venture in there , especially if the day was sunny , but in summer it was unbearable , stifling . One summer a hailstorm rudely smashed many of the panes . <p> Miss Beaurie had a butler , whose name was Aaron . Long after she died , he showed up at our house one day . He was slight , stooped , light-colored , and like Fox , not talkative . He had considerable dignity and used no wiles on us , simply was there , and in some inexplicable way , ours . We were expected to find work for him , to provide . We did . He did some garden work for my mother and whatever odd jobs could be found for him . He ate there , received clothes , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with us until he grew too old to work , and then , in his last illness , my mother went up and nursed him , she said , meaning I suppose that she brought him what food he needed and saw to it that he was sheltered and comfortable . I remember that he asked her once for a fruitcake at Christmas " to put in his trunk . " She made it for him , with the others she cooked each Christmas , and he did , I am sure , as he said , store it in his trunk for eating a little at a time . <p> The edicts of Miss Beaurie thus continued through many years and lives . You did what was expected of you , in the way it was expected for you to do it . Ella Somerville in Oxford had much of this same nature . In her last illness , in the hospital , she received her visitors , I am told , propped up in a splendid negligee , conversant and interesting as if in her own parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of the Oxford Somervilles ' past . Their mother , a Vassar , had come from there . Though the old Vassar home had fallen into disrepair and at last disappeared , it had stood on the highest hill in Carrollton , and there stood also the town standpipe . Ella and her sister Nina Cully used to joke about owning our town 's water supply . Connections are what you 'd better have in Mississippi in order to mention anything . Ella Somerville was a friend and confidante of Eudora Welty , of Stark Young and William Faulkner , and of many others , including myself . Her name occurs and will occur in the literary records of her time and place . <p> The night of Miss Beaurie 's death my father , as I said , " went up there . " " Sitting up " with the newly dead was the custom in those days . When one group had served out a sufficient number of hours , others would come in to stay , and so on through the night . My father came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told my mother . My mother burst into tears . <p> It seemed the gift of the diamond was not altogether based on old family friendship , though certainly that was the major part of it . Miss Beaurie had a " place " over in the Delta . A part of everyone 's way of life in our old hill town was owning distant property , a " place in the Delta . " It was usually rented to someone to arm , and furnished an income . My father , being well-known as a good businessman , had given free advice to Miss Beaurie through the years . I do n't know if he went so far as to interview her managers or personally see how well they attended to their work , but he knew what she should be realizing on the farm and could offer a firm hand if needed , and help her with expenses . She was recognizing his services , as well as the long tie with our family , by this legacy . She was doing , as usual , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Miss Beaurie 's death . Searching through her house for some necessary article , my father opened a closet door , and hundreds of small , empty paregoric bottles fell out on the floor . Paregoric was used a lot in those days for easing pain . It was measured out by the teaspoonful in a small amount of water for swallowing down . What painful health problem was going on beneath all those skirts and petticoats , with those arms and legs never exposed , that long neck sheathed in lace Paregoric is also a derivative of opium . <p> Miss Beaurie 's diamond was exceptionally large . My mother had it set with her engagement diamond , which my father as a young man , before he met her , had bought for fifty dollars from a nameless wanderer who had ridden the rails from Memphis and needed cash . This one too was large and fine , well over a carat , and the pair looked good when mounted together . <p> All links join the world , or did join in the world where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my husband and I noted a sign in northern Virginia that indicated a battlefield nearby  --  Bull Run , or in other words , Manassas. e drove to see it . I recall it vividly now  --  a treeless long green meadow , sloping upward toward a cresting hill . <p> I thought of Beauregard : General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard , C.S.A . Beau regard ... beautiful glance . <p> How easy to visualize him , his ornate New Orleans name worn easily , the noble head , the straight bearing . He holds his fine horse firmly reined beneath him  --  arched neck , ears forward , rich mane and tail furling in the breeze . See him poised just at the crest there , looking outward on his field of victory . Nothing is before him now but the sweep of tall , green grass , bending softly in the light wind . The moment is one of triumph and beauty and silence . There are no dead . <p>                  @ @ @
