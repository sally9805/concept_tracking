<p> JANUARY <p> <p> If Judas Priest gets sued for inducing suicide , can the DIVINYLS get sued for inspiring masturbation ? I Touch Myself , ' the breakthrough single from the Australian duo , not only turned out to be the best onanistic ditty since Cyndi Lauper crooned She Bop ' but featured a video that should leave teenagers going blind well into the twenty-first century .

A few people came up to me and said , You should n't go on with the ceremony , ' ' said Sire Records chief SEYMOUR STEIN after the crowd watched the president 's address . No one likes what 's going on outside , but LAVERN BAKER , JOHN LEE HOOKER , the IMPRESSIONS , JIMMY REED , WILSON PICKETT and all the others we 're inducting - we 're talking about lifetime careers .

' said guitarist NUNO BETTENCOURT of EXTREME after the band 's second album was released . Before long , Pornograffitti had sold more than a million copies . The band 's success had mostly to do with its acoustic smash More Than Words ' and the accompanying video , which was not exactly hard to look at . <p> The war in the gulf had everybody seeing stars ( and stripes ) at L.A.

SONIC YOUTH and PUBLIC ENEMY shared a bill at Chicago 's Aragon Ballroom , and while the concert proper went off without a hitch , police and antiwar protesters were at each other 's throats just outside . An investigation was launched into the event , which yielded eighteen arrests and four police-brutality complaints , including one from a woman who was pulled by her hair to a squad car . <p> Photos : Above : The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame jam .

The article proclaimed that rock music , the exciting noise that four people can make with electric guitars , bass and drums , was on its way out . In 1990 , for the first time in more than twenty-five years , not one rock album hit Number One . <p> But 1991 was a rock renaissance : True-blue rock bands METALLICA , VAN HALEN , the BLACK CROWES and GUNS N ' ROSES all reached the top of the Billboard chart , and a host of other guitar-oriented acts - such as JOHN MELLENCAMP , EXTREME , CHRIS ISAAK and QUEENSRYCHE - put in strong showings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - cheaply recorded and much more likely to rack up big sales the first time out - people have spoken , and they want their rock &; roll . <p> Rock 's resurgence is also due to the music business 's being dependably cyclical , and after the late-Eighties dance-pop boom , the trend has gone full circle . Like disco before it , dance pop leapt in to fill the space between rock 's popularity peaks , only to be pushed aside as major rock acts released records in 1991 . <p> For the most part , chart-topping rock is hard rock and metal , which are becoming thoroughly formulaic and derivative ; most of this year 's major sellers simply rehashed older forms . Even rugged individualists Metallica and R.E.M . moved significantly toward the mainstream . <p> But bands such as JANE 'S ADDICTION , JESUS JONES , HAPPY MONDAYS , FOUR HORSEMEN , RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS , FISHBONE and PRIMUS are all injecting new elements into a medium that has always thrived on outside influences . Guitar alchemists such as SONIC YOUTH and PIXIES are further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most up-and-coming , cutting-edge bands are guitar oriented . <p> And in terms of both sound and vision , there 's no duplicating the sheer physicality of playing a guitar or hitting a drum . Music fans are rediscovering the authenticity of acoustic performances - witness the unplugged ' trend . And do n't forget the backlash from the Milli Vanilli fiasco . <p> NEIL YOUNG flew the guitar flag high with his overpowering Ragged Glory tour early in 1991 . As the gulf war raged thousands of miles away , Young reasserted rock 's role as electronic folk music . All squalling feedback , angry distortion and flawed but passionate vocals , rock &; roll was the only way to rail against the carnage . Young once sang , Hey hey , my my , rock &; roll will never die . ' And he was right - it just fades away now and then . <p> Photo : Neil Young ( KEVIN MAZUR ) <p> Photos : Metallica ( left ) and the Black Crowes ( right ) ( MARK SELIGER ) <p> Photo : The Four Horsemen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Out of Time was the right record to make , ' guitarist PETER BUCK said of R.E.M .

Buck , however , was unimpressed with the view from on high : We 'll be Number One for a week , and then some woman with really large breasts and a really high voice will be Number One . ' That woman soon turned out to be Michael Bolton . <p> There 's no high like high society . N.W.A rapper EAZY-E donated $2490 for the honor of joining ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER and other right-minded folks at a luncheon for the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle .

I 'm like If the Democrats had a fund-raiser , I 'd probably go to that , too . ' ' <p> JANET JACKSON was one-half of a brother-sister team that shook the music industry down for a couple of the most disquieting deals in history . The singer , whose contract with A &M; had lapsed , was lured to Virgin Records by owner Richard Branson , who was itching to snag the company 's first international superstar . Jackson 's royalty rate might not have been as impressive as her brother 's , but in a halfhearted stab at discretion , her manager allowed that the singer 's take was well in excess of $50 million . ' <p> Grandfatherly GRATEFUL DEAD mascot JERRY GARCIA ducked his New York art debut , but that did n't stop throngs of cash-wielding Deadheads from converging on the Ambassador Gallery . Garcia - who studied at the California School of Fine Arts - also had shows in Berkeley , California , and Washington , D.C. Prices ranged from bitchin ' ( $200 ) to uncool and heavy ( $40,000 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In March the sure-footed pop icon signed a groundbreaking contract with Sony that was so stratospheric it suggested that the recording industry was in for either a new beginning or a quick and ugly death . Jackson would receive an awfully cool $9 million when he turned in his next album . And should it perform as well as his last record , Bad , he stood to pocket $75 million more . <p> Maybe it 's just that we play songs and people like them , ' singer-philosopher CHRIS ROBINSON of the BLACK CROWES said of the multiplatinum success of the band 's debut record , Shake Your Money Maker . As to whether the band 's retro-rock was original , Robinson fumed : What is original ? I 'm not going to bang two badger carcasses together and recite poetry and say , Hey , here 's the new thing .

And there is still plenty more Dylanalia to come . <p> When VAL KILMER reported he 'd been visited by the spirit of JIM MORRISON , we should have known he was in over his head . The actor 's freakily accurate portrayal of the late singer held audience attention even as OLIVER STONE 's movie The Doors drifted off into Sixties la-la land .

The bonanza for Dylanologists did n't translate into mass-market book sales , however . Instead , mainstream audiences pushed autobiographies by Michael Jackson 's sister La Toya Jackson ( La Toya ) and Beach Boys catalyst Brian Wilson ( Would n't It Be Nice ) onto the bestseller lists , with both books detailing the pain and suffering the artists endured during their childhoods . <p> Fortunately , most unauthorized musical biographies this year were well-researched and often-compelling attempts to demystify their subjects . Michael Jackson : The Magic and the Madness , by J. RANDY TARABORRELLI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information gleaned from previous interviews , legal transcripts and disgruntled ex-employees . Former Rolling Stone writer BEN FONG-TORRES 's Hickory Wind : The Life and Times of Gram Parsons pays loving and critical tribute to the late country-rock pioneer in a vital work that finally explains the man behind the myth . Guitar god Jimi Hendrix also got his due in Electric Gypsy , an exhaustive and exhausting 700-page biography by HARRY SHAPIRO and CAESAR GLEBBEEK that uses rare tapes , letters , lyrics , diaries and other unpublished research to draw its powerful portrait of the late artist . An oral history about the Grateful Dead , DAVID GANS 's Conversations With the Dead , contains insightful interviews , highlighted by an exclusive Q &A; with mysterious Dead colleague and former acid king Owsley Stanley III . On a similarly trippy note , the late NICHOLAS SCHAFFNER 's Saucerful of Secrets : The Pink Floyd Odyssey broke down some walls with its comprehensive , evenhanded study of the psychedelic group . <p> Other biographies published this year include a number of MADONNA books , such as NORMAN KING 's Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But who really needs to read dirt about a woman who willingly talks about blow jobs and her sordid past ? Another outspoken performer who rated more than one biography this year was Sinead O'Connor . JIMMY GUTERMAN 's Sinead , for example , presents a lot of factoids but fails to capture the soul of this complex artist . Nothing compares to O'Connor or Madonna on the charts , but obviously much more vital and valuable for roots-music fans is Good Rockin ' Tonight , by COLIN ESCOTT with MARTIN HAWKINS , which admirably recounts the birth of rock &; roll at Sam Phillips 's famed Sun Studios , in Memphis . <p> Also worth noting : Everybody Was Kung-Fu Dancing , a smart , wry anthology of pieces by former Rolling Stone editor CHET FLIPPO ; Sting : The Illustrated Lyrics , by comix artist ROBERT GLIGOROV ; and All You Need to Know About the Music Business , by music attorney DONALD S.

It used to be that in the land of video all the girls grew up to be goddesses , all the boys grew up to have big hair , and stuff tended to blow up an awful lot . These days things have changed . Now , when viewers want their MTV , they also want quality three-minute movies that avoid straining the American attention span . <p> This is not to say old themes do n't die hard .

Sure , the Poundcake ' clip has all the necessary ingredients to make it a VH vid : EDDIE VAN HALEN makes goofy faces directly into the camera while his shirtless brother ALEX flexes seemingly every time he pounds his drums . But the video 's greatest gift of all is the view it gives every red-blooded male of what really happens when their dates go to the bathroom together . Who could have known that the ladies ' room is actually a haven for throngs of women to strip down to their panties , put on makeup and practice just enough lesbian-erotic imagery to titillate even the most conservative Midwestern gas-station attendant ? Van Halen , the American male thanks you . <p> Thank-yous abounded this year for R.E.M .

Marshall Crenshaw ( TIMOTHY WHITE ) <p> Question : Who is MARSHALL CRENSHAW ? Last May the charismatic - though not yet internationally famous - cult leader released his sixth album , a beguiling effort titled Life 's Too Short . ' <p> NOTABLE NEWS <p> <p> Word came that VANILLA ICE was to star in the biker romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting skills , ' Ice said at the time . They say I 'm original and stuff . And I 'm like Whatever that is .

For the first time in what seems like an eternity , the year in music came through with an invigorating dose of originality and passion without succumbing to the gaggle of bands with video-ready metal coifs or a lead singer whose bra size is larger than her IQ . <p> Whether it was the DREAM WARRIORS pushing the ever-expanding envelope of hip-hop with a brilliant , intricate amalgam of jazz , pop and reggae , EMF hitting Number One with the simplest of cheesy dance-pop hooks , FOLLOW FOR NOW fusing funk , metal and ska with a social conscience or NIRVANA simply wailing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1991 proved that rock &; roll is once again a many splendored thing and that hair spray , eyeliner and spandex might just be banished to junior-high lockers forever . <p> Then again , let 's not kid ourselves . The year was n't all a box of chocolates . Unfortunately , sometimes a year 's new face is simply that - a face first and substance second . In 1991 , the largest withdrawal from the bank of MTV was made by C+C MUSIC FACTORY - a moniker that might as well stand for conceptualized and choreographed - which snatched up two trophies at this year 's MTV video awards and scored a series of exer-hits with titles like Gon na Make You Sweat . ' <p> But if the processed feel of the C+C ( I 'm not a singer , but I play one on MTV ' ' ) videos left you feeling like you had , gasp , lost the will to dance , five tykes from England arrived on the scene sporting instruments that , up until lately , had been a mere novelty among dance-music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 's biggest dance-rock smash , a cross-genre success story that the band is well aware of . We 're a rock band that you can dance to , ' said drummer MARK DECLOEDT , who also seems to be cognizant of the fact that with success comes plenty of personal scrutiny . We 're just successful , ' he added . And without being conceited , we are quite good-looking . ' <p> If SEAL 's ego did n't quite equal that of his chart rival EMF , perhaps it was because he had a firm grasp of recent history . The Soul &; B sensation garnered countless comparisons to the freshman triumph of Terence Trent D'Arby , but unlike his counterpart , this year 's phenom at least tried to let his music do the talking . I 've been constantly surrounded by people from the record company saying , Hey , man . Your record 's fucking brilliant ! ' ' said Seal . It gets me really annoyed . It 's not brilliant . I 'll know when I do something brilliant . ' With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singles , Seal was able to break onto the pop charts without alienating himself from friends and fans alike . <p> And then , sometimes alienation pays off in spades . Nirvana - which jumped to a major label after its stunning Sub Pop debut , Bleach - released Nevermind , a desperate wail from the Washington State wilderness that is equal parts complacency and rage , pop tunesmanship and shotgun blasts of guitar grunge . With KURT COBAIN 's Sinatra-meets-Satan growl above the din , the band not only produced the year 's most passionate release but helped reestablish Seattle as the premier home of too often buried guitar-rock treasure . <p> To help prove that point , PEARL JAM rose from the ashes of one of that city 's great bands , Mother Love Bone . With the help of new singer EDDIE VEDDER , M.L.B. members STONE GOSSARD and JEFF AMENT overcame the tragic death of their friend and band mate ANDREW WOOD to form Pearl Jam and release Ten , one of the year 's most startling collections of songs . And while the group has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it features a life-affirming vocal depth altogether unfamiliar in hard rock . All I really believe in is this fucking moment , like right now , ' said Vedder , explaining the band 's philosophy . That , actually , is what the whole album talks about . ' <p> Whatever the FOUR HORSEMEN are talking about , the one sure bet is that they 're going to be saying it loudly . But that 's to be expected when a lead singer lands his job by being the bloodiest guy still standing after a barroom brawl . Discovered by Def American owner and noise meister RICK RUBIN , fronted by a psychotic ex-con turned singer and featuring a drummer named DIMWIT , this five-piece band woke up the increasingly glam-metal neighborhood of L.A. with one of the most in-your-face debuts in recent memory . <p> And just to prove that America does n't have a monopoly on the entire guitar market , a handful of young British bands broke through with some brave new sounds of their own . The most adventuresome of the horde is RIDE , a foursome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly endless string of singles and EPs and , finally , on Nowhere , a trance-inducing collection of songs that fuses growling guitars , psychedelic imagery and pure momentum into one beautiful package . <p> The package that brought the LA 'S to America might sound a tad familiar : four young men from Liverpool with bad haircuts playing smart , articulate , harmony-drenched pop . But if the La 's resume sounds like the Beatles revisited , their debut comes off more like the Monkees after picking up an ass-kicking guitar player on the way to the TV studio . The songs are pure pop with a powerful thrust - unapologetically addictive tunes for even the most jaded of rock fans . Unfortunately , the band members ca n't really be included on that list of fans . The record 's crap , ' said singer LEE MAVERS , just before letting you know that he 's really not stretching the bounds of self-deprecation but , rather , pissed off at the band 's producer . Fucking brilliant songs but you would n't know it , because it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's more than one way to grind an axe , the CHARLATANS UK sprang from the Manchester music scene 's trippy rock-and-house-music fusion to dominate their home country 's club consciousness . The Charlatans ' success , however , was n't limited to British shores . On the strength of a propulsive , Hammond-organ sound , a hit single , The Only One I Know , ' and sheer bravado , the band dominated the American alternative market . We never wanted to be an indie band or a dance band or a garage band or a rock band , ' said singer TIM BURGESS . We just want to be the biggest , greatest fuckin ' band in the world since the Rolling Stones or the Beatles . And I 'm pretty sure we have the potential to actually do it . ' <p> This year also showcased an eclectic group of musicians who proved their brilliance without actually telling you . The Dream Warriors accomplished at least one thing that no hip-hop group before them had managed : They forced fans to look north . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intricate , playful rhymes around jazz and reggae , the band 's album , And Now the Legacy Begins , played like an updated musical-history text . Canada is always slow to get into things , ' said Warrior KING LOU , but things do happen . They just never get the attention . Everybody wants something different now . They 're tired of the same old speakers-and-sneakers thing . ' <p> SMASHING PUMPKINS did n't so much pay homage to rock history but tear it limb from limb . Gish , the Chicago foursome 's debut , is a whirlpool of feedback , psychedelia and distorted energy . But while the stunning first effort has earned a flood of critical acclaim and major-label interest , the band is afraid to rest on its now-established laurels . You might do something , and you 'll feel the warmth of satisfaction for one day , until the next day you realize how much more capable you are than that , ' said singer-guitarist BILLY CORGAN . It occurs to you that the sky is that much higher than you thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It might be tough for Atlanta 's Follow for Now to follow up its debut with a better record . The twelve-song coming out runs the gamut of razor-edged indulgence , spitting out hard rock , driving funk , ska and even covering Public Enemy 's She Watch Channel Zero . ' Follow for Now 's name , in fact , comes from a PE lyric , and the band 's own wordplay is every bit as pointedly smart and confrontational as that of the rappers . It 's not some kind of responsibility to write lyrics like this , ' said singer DAVID RYAN HARRIS . But I find it difficult writing songs about silly things when there 's so many things that need to be said . ' <p> You 'd have to toss FATIMA MANSIONS frontman CATHAL COUGHLAN onto the list of artists who have no time or patience for the trivial . The Irish band 's debut , Viva Dead Ponies , is perhaps the most startling documentation of post-Reagan rage to emerge yet , bounding from Coughlan 's beautiful tenor to venomous screams of accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just assaulting people for the sake of it , ' said Coughlan . And indeed he does n't . Viva Dead Ponies introduces Coughlan as an exceptionally focused political activist who also has a stunningly apocalyptic musical vision . I 'm not afraid to be absurd , ' he said . I 'm not afraid to ridicule myself . I do n't care if I come across as being a maniac . The main thing I want to have is an entity . I do n't want people to think that I 'm not trying to explain a particular subject matter I 'm dealing with . The songs I 'm interested in are ones that are concerned with upheaval and confrontation , chaos and absurdity . ' <p> Not that all the year 's poignant lyricists were forecasting a chance of rain or mushroom clouds . SAM PHILLIPS followed up her exceptional debut , The Indescribable Wow , with Cruel Inventions , helping prove that it actually is possible to find beautiful , articulate pop in the Nineties - it just might take some searching . Produced with her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album turned out to be one of the year 's most arresting treasures . This is the problem , ' said Phillips . My music is sort of alternative , but it 's not quite alternative . Comments I hear from professional people are like Well , it 's not dance music , it 's not this or that . ' Nobody can tell what it is or where it can fit . The other thing is , even though I do like some strange things , I 'm a sucker for a pop song . ' <p> Also out of the shadows cast by many far less talented hair bands came another sucker for a pop song , MARC COHN , who took Phillips one step further - scoring a hit with Walking in Memphis . ' The amazing thing is that since I wrote Memphis , ' I have n't really come up with a lousy song , ' said Cohn . And this is after many , many years of nothing but lousy songs . ' Cohn 's brand of storytelling and understated melodies even nabbed him spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costello . <p> And if the fusion of folk and rock had seemed like it lost a bit of adhesiveness , the BEDLAM ROVERS came along , tossed in enough Celtic strains to tie the two back together and produced one of the year 's most moving albums . Frothing Green , the debut from the self-confessed folk punks ' from San Francisco , combines Irish folk music with rock and political correctness without coming off as retro or preachy . This is an activist band , ' said guitarist MARKO SAKMANN . I do n't think songs change the world , but they are an expression of our activism . ' After far too many years of rock-star primping and posing , 1991 might just have helped prove to up-and-coming bands that it 's possible for beauty to lie within songs themselves and not in the trunk of the Avon lady 's Buick . <p> Photos : You Can Dance If You Wan na : The hit-making C + C Music Factory ( above ) and EMF ( below ) ( MICHAEL LAVINE/OUTLINE , STEVE DOUBLE/RETNA ) <p> Photo : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nirvana ( above ) and Pearl Jam ( below ) proved themselves the pride of the Evergreen State .

This time , the Godfather of Soul assembled the masses to announce plans for his postprison pay-per-view concert and coming-out party , at which the hardest-working man in show business traded steps with M.C.

Guess which path GUNS N ' ROSES have chosen . <p> Yes , 1991 was another year of routine tumult and willed controversy in the life of the world 's favorite fuck-you band . Matters started off with the Gunners ' insistence that publications wanting interviews sign a contract yielding all publication rights to the group - an outrageous violation of standard journalistic practice . The band later withdrew the demand . An abrupt change in management then helped delay the releases of Use Your Illusion I and II - the Gunners ' first albums since the gazillion-selling , and aptly titled , Appetite for Destruction , from 1987 - by several months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the stores . The albums seized the top two spots in their debut week on the charts anyway - a first . <p> The Get in the Ring Motherfucker Tour , of course , provided the occasion for all manner of mishap . Singer AXL ROSE injured his foot during a club date that preceded the tour 's start and performed the opening shows in East Troy , Wisconsin , in a splint . On Long Island , New York , Guns n ' Roses hit the boards two and a half hours late ; in his now de rigueur onstage rant , Axl excoriated Rolling Stone , the New York Times and Geffen Records , the band 's label . In St. Louis , Axl thought it wise to vent his anger over lax security ' by leaping into the crowd , scuffling with a patron and then suddenly quitting the stage , triggering a riot in which sixty people were injured . The resulting uproar inspired the band to include the soaringly articulate message Fuck you , St. Louis ! ' in the liner notes to Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer similar good wishes to the band at a public rally . <p> Meanwhile , guitarist IZZY STRADLIN , reportedly fed up by the circus atmosphere of the tour , failed to turn up at a couple of video shoots and was widely rumored to be leaving the performing lineup of G n ' R , to be replaced by DAVE NAVARRO of Jane 's Addiction . Stradlin finally decided to stay . After the usual delays , the second leg of the two-year ( ! ) Guns n ' Roses tour is now being scheduled . <p> Oh - and the music ? Killer . The live shows have garnered raves , and despite its idiotic chick-bashing , Use Your Illusion I and II is a sprawling , savage masterwork that simultaneously captures the group 's inchoate rage and longs for a transcendent escape into a sweeter , more exquisite world elsewhere .

But by playing to almost half a million people across the country , the tour triumphed by sending a message to the staggering corporate rock-tour industry . This was not a shoo-in , ' said Farrell . The Who was not going to fly in on a helicopter . You want to hear bullshit about Woodstock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People smashed fences down . It was n't exactly Eden . The myth is something else .

At the Riverport Amphitheater , outside St. Louis , a riot broke out when AXL ROSE dove into the crowd after a camera-toting fan .

' <p> When I wrote Eleanor Rigby , ' I got to thinking , What am I going to do when I 'm thirty ? ' ' said PAUL MCCARTNEY , 49 , before the premiere of the Liverpool Oratorio , his classical debut . I had an image of moving into this kind of thing .

Woodface , the most challenging collection to spring from the harmonic magicians from New Zealand , showcased the songwriting and vocal talents of every band member - including a batch of Finn-Finn classics such as Chocolate Cake ' - and led to one of the year 's best tours : a full-house show opened by RICHARD THOMPSON . <p> ICE CUBE 's frank rap portrayals of L.A. street life helped land him a major role in Boyz n the Hood , a frank cinematic portrayal of L.A. street life .

The recession currently affecting most businesses in America did not overlook popular music . Figures for the first half of 1991 , for instance , showed that unit shipments were down by 34 million , or eleven percent , from the previous year . <p> In light of hard economic times - and the fact that in America the market for recorded music has not only stopped growing but shrunk - the international conglomerates ( Time Warner , Sony Corporation , Philips N.V. , PolyGram N.V. , BMG , Thorn EMI and Matsushita ) that now own or distribute all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their holdings . In some cases they have n't liked what they 've seen . <p> Atlantic Records ( a Time Warner company ) pulled the plug on its Atco Records subsidiary , firing about thirty employees and bringing the rest of the staff , as well as the artist roster , to the relatively new , Atlantic-owned EastWest label . Island Records lost its marketing , promotion and sales staffs ( more than twenty employees ) , becoming a glorified A &R; wing of PolyGram N.V. , which bought Island in 1989 . At press time , word was out that Chrysalis Records was being taken over by Thorn EMI , which had bought half of the company several years ago and has the option to buy the rest . Staff cuts in some departments were expected to be one result of any takeover . <p> If the established majors are in trouble , consider the plight of a dozen or so new labels that started during the past three years . This was the first year that many of the start- ups - such as Disney 's Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - really got rolling . Some of the newcomers got off to a solid start in the face of great odds . Interscope , for instance , sold about a half-million or more copies of albums by Gerardo and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and the soundtrack to Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey ; it was expecting to do at least that well with Primus 's label debut . Morgan Creek , in a joint venture with A &M; Records , sold 7 million copies worldwide of Bryan Adams 's single ( Everything I Do ) I Do It for You ' while enjoying sales of more than a million copies of the Robin Hood soundtrack . Giant broke Color Me Badd , while DGC ( a Geffen subsidiary ) made waves with Sonic Youth and Nirvana . <p> Yet rumors of the demise of a number of new labels circulated all year within the industry . Hardly a week went by that someone was n't predicting the ouster of Hollywood Records president Peter Paterno . And although many label presidents spoke confidently of multiyear commitments from BMG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Terry Ellis 's Imago Records ( just three albums released to date ) and Lou Maglia 's Zoo label ( no major hits yet ) . <p> Meanwhile , in another realm , one of the most innovative and important independent record-distribution companies - the adamantly alternative Rough Trade - went belly up , wreaking havoc among dozens of underfinanced independent record companies ranging from Minneapolis 's Twin/Tone Records to San Francisco 's Heyday Records . <p> One of the biggest changes affecting the record business was the implementation of a new system of compiling the Billboard Top Albums chart . Billboard began using a new computerized system - operated by the SoundScan company - that tallies actual sales of albums , unlike the highly subjective system that was used previously . <p> The first week the new chart debuted , it sent the record business into a tailspin . Numerous new acts on the chart dropped drastically from where they 'd been the previous week . Record executives were ready to form a lynch mob . <p> Some believed , however , that record executives were actually upset because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart as they had been under the old system . Yet despite the criticism , the new chart has become accepted in the industry . As time has passed , many executives have changed their minds . <p> Perhaps most important , the new SoundScan system has brought a sense of reality to the business . No longer are the number of albums shipped the standard by which an album 's success is measured . When Guns n ' Roses released Use Your Illusion I and II this past fall , the immediate success of those albums was gauged by the hard sales figures ( about 1.5 million copies sold during the first week ) . And because of the sophistication of the information that SoundScan provides , managers and labels can now obtain information on sales in particular cities and regions , allowing them to track the results of specific promotional events . <p> Ironically , what the SoundScan chart has done this year is prevent record executives from keeping their heads in the sand ; it has forced them to face the music . Week after week , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numbers their ups and downs , victories and defeats . Unfortunately for most record companies , the story the charts have told during 1991 has been a sad one . <p> Illustration : ( TERRY ALLEN ) <p> <p> AUGUST <p> <p> If on the afternoon of August 15th , ART GARFUNKEL had looked out a window in his Fifth Avenue apartment , he would likely have noticed the 750,000 people who gathered in Central Park to pledge allegiance to a former associate of his , PAUL SIMON . Asked about his conspicuous absence from the concert , which included everything from Bridge Over Troubled Water ' to The Obvious Child , ' Garfunkel moaned to the New York Times , I 'm not good enough to be invited . ' <p> From here on out , AEROSMITH will walk any damn way it pleases . In August , the band signed one of the most lucrative rock deals in history , a contract in which Sony guarantees a reported $30 million for four albums . Aerosmith still has three records due to Geffen , so by the time STEVEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearing fifty . Some have wondered if , by that point , they 'll be able to walk at all . <p> METALLICA went into the studio to make a record drummer LARS ULRICH could comfortably call huge and big and throbbing . ' The band came out with a dizzyingly intense album that debuted at Number One on the Billboard chart . Metallica was full of stripped-down , four-to-six-minute songs , as well as one shockingly candid and soulful acoustic number called Nothing Else Matters , ' about which singer JAMES HETFIELD said : I always wanted to do something more like that , but I knew it would freak people out . I freaked myself out when I was doing it . ' There were very few complaints about the long-awaited record . Friends of mine who are really hardcore fans have said , You guys are n't as heavy as you used to be , ' ' said guitarist KIRK HAMMETT . I go , Man , you 're telling me Sad but True ' is n't heavy ? Holier Than Thou ' is n't heavy ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really alive , how come he has n't bagged an Ultra Slim-Fast commercial ? This is just one of the many intriguing questions that was n't really answered at all by The Elvis Files , a live two-hour TV testimonial to Geraldo Rivera 's influence on journalism . But if the show did n't produce the King , it did resurrect BILL BIXBY , the host for all 120 minutes of investigative integrity . <p> BILLY JOEL tried to pass it off as an everyday neighborhood benefit , but when he was joined by DON HENLEY , PAUL SIMON , FOREIGNER and a host of others in Montauk , New York - summer home to the rich and employees of the rich - it could n't help being more upscale . Then again , other neighborhoods ca n't gross a million bucks in two days for a handful of local charities . I know that people are burnt out with benefits , ' said Joel , a year-round area resident . I 'm sensitive to that . But this was a good combination of organizations .

Within seven days of formation , the group penned eleven songs , played a show and recorded demos . It was a totally magical thing , ' said Vedder . It was the most intense musical experience I 've ever been involved in , ' said Vedder . <p> The winning , if occasionally inscrutable , singer-songwriter ROBYN HITCHCOCK turned out Perspex Island , another masterwork of charming post-Beatles weirdness .

ETERNAL ' The KLF - Arista <p> TOP COLLEGE ALBUM SUPERSTITION Siouxsie and the Banshees - Geffen <p> <p> MTV TURNS TEN <p> On August 1st , 1981 , a few ticks after midnight , MTV went on the air with a two-year-old clip of Video Killed the Radio Star , ' by the Buggles . The choice of that particular song may have been random - MTV had only 575 videos to choose from , compared with more than 8000 today - but now that the channel has altered the look and sound of pop music , the Buggles title seems like a bold prophecy . <p> When MTV 's tenth anniversary arrived this summer , the only on-air celebration was a rebroadcast of Video Killed the Radio Star ' and other long-forgotten first-hour clips by Styx and PH.D . MTV has always preferred now to then , and executives knew their 54.5 million subscribers would n't like to see Guns n ' Roses and Jesus Jones replaced by relics like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , though , an abundance of media coverage , from TV Guide , which noted that MTV helped create a new visual language , shaped fashion , defined a youth culture and just may even have saved an entire industry , ' to the Village Voice , which reprinted an Island Records memo instructing staff to stuff the ballot box for DIAL MTV by using speed-dialing buttons to repeatedly request a Drivin-n-Cryin video . The memo demonstrated MTV 's power within the music industry , just in case anyone had missed the lessons of Madonna . <p> MTV , these retrospectives agreed , had eroded our national attention span , then spawned a culture in which sound bites trumped logic , every movie had a soundtrack and good hair put you halfway to stardom . Its influence had extended far beyond pop music - what was Ronald Reagan , after all , but the Milli Vanilli of politics ? <p> Only it 's not so simple . Because for a long time , MTV was a passive medium - the channel did n't create videos , it just received and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shopping Network for the record companies , ' chairman Tom Freston said quite happily . MTV 's chief artistic ' role was in acquisitions meetings , where new clips were screened and either added to the playlist or rejected . MTV lit a match when it aired Video Killed the Radio Star , ' then stood around and watched others huff and puff the sparks into a bonfire . <p> Within the last few years , though , MTV has been invigorated by two good new shows - YO ! MTV RAPS and MTV UNPLUGGED - which have broadened its influence even further while atoning for horrible lapses of judgment . Ted Demme , now twenty-eight , was a lowly production assistant when he proposed a rap show in 1988 . They , being MTV , just did n't know anything about rap , ' says Demme . It was a really white channel . ' Indeed , the neglect of rap was n't surprising ; not long after the channel began , executives were accused of racism for not airing videos by black artists . Demme continued badgering ' his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents Just Do n't Understand , ' by D.J . Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince , and so Demme was given one chance . Yo ! premiered on a Saturday ; on Monday morning , when the impressive ratings came in , MTV executives - who might have been slow but certainly were n't stupid - decided that the show should become a regular feature . <p> Although MTV wo n't disclose ratings for specific shows , executives acknowledge that Yo ! is their top-rated show . Working with smaller budgets , rappers have made some of the most exciting videos of the last few years , but the special appeal of Yo ! lies with hosts Fab 5 Freddy ( who 's on Saturdays ) and especially Dr. Dre and Ed Lover ( who handle weekdays ) . <p> Unplugged , which debuted early in 1990 , was proposed by Bob Small and Jim Burns , a team of director-producers in their late thirties . Friends told them MTV would never air a weekly acoustic concert . MTV had never figured out how to integrate live music into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an instant success . The first guests were struggling neo-folkies like Michelle Shocked and Syd Straw , whose acoustic performances were similar to what they usually did in concert . The show took off only when stars like Elton John and Sting agreed to perform , stripping away the dry ice , Vari-lights and electric hyperbole of a live arena show in the name of musicianly authenticity . <p> Paul McCartney released his Unplugged session as an album , and Hall and Oates toured with a small acoustic ensemble like the one they used on the show . Two of the most dynamic clips in the history of MTV went right from Unplugged to daily rotation : Great White 's ghostly perfect re-creation of Led Zeppelin 's Babe I 'm Gon na Leave You ' and L.L. Cool J 's explosive performance of Mama Said Knock You Out ' with a full band . Maybe the L.L. clip made the other videos look dull , but MTV did n't care . Because if you wanted to see it again , you had to keep watching . <p> Photo : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina Blackwood , Mark Goodman , Martha Quinn , J.J.

This year saw a handful of musicians take to writing kids ' books . PAUL SIMON lent his famously loopy tune At the Zoo ' to a picture book of the same name . The song made an easy transition to the page , with the exception of the sticky lines Hamsters turn on frequently ' and The zoo keeper is very fond of Rum . ' In illustrator VALERIE MICHAUT 's drawings , the zoo keeper in is shown patting the head of a beaver named Rum . And those trippy rodents are seen wearing miners ' hats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't dead ; they 're just living at the zoo . <p> To all the forests that have sprung up in children 's stories , GRATEFUL DEAD guitarist BOB WEIR added the African rain forest this year . His book Panther Dream follows the hunting-related adventures of a boy named Lokuli , who tries to save his village from starvation . ( Just so you Do n't worry : He does . ) The book , illustrated by Weir 's sister , WENDY WEIR , comes complete with a glossary of the relevant flora and fauna . <p> CARLY SIMON 's contribution to the baby-book boom was The Fisherman 's Song , a moody story about a young island girl who falls in love with a fisherman , shacks up with him and then gets dumped . Dumped ! The girl , who continues to suffer from the greatest love of all , then starts sneaking into the fisherman 's house just to watch him sleep . The story , - told with a dreamy poetry - is like Fatal Attraction for kids .

It was an active year in the jailhouse-rock department , with the lion 's share of pent-up , put-out singers favoring the old-fashioned , no-frills assault . <p> Early in the year , the TIME 's guitarist JESSE JOHNSON picked up a second-degree assault charge when he threatened his estranged wife with a 9-mm pistol , then attempted to kill himself . Johnson 's lawyer said , What he did was stupid , but that does n't make him a criminal . ' Point taken : It makes him a stupid criminal . <p> In March , NEW KID DONNIE WAHLBERG used vodka to set the hallway of a Louisville , Kentucky , hotel on fire .

In Studio City , California , statuesque rapper VANILLA ICE brandished a 9-mm pistol - apparently a discerning pop star 's firearm of choice - in the face of a man who was trying to sell him jewelry . ( We can assume the man had nothing in a gold #1 . ) <p> In May the four-foot-six GETO BOY rapper BUSHWICK BILL , who exhibits all the classic symptoms of nervous tension , hurled a vacuum cleaner at his girlfriend , handed her a loaded .22-caliber derringer and begged her to take his life . Bill lost his right eye in the ensuing struggle . A month later , funkster RICK JAMES was jailed on charges that he and his girlfriend TANYA ANNE HIJAZI patty-hearsted a woman at his Hollywood Hills home , burning their captive with a crack pipe and a red-hot butcher knife and forcing her to perform oral sex on Hijazi . <p> In light of the aforementioned goings-on , CARLOS SANTANA 's June marijuana bust seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before rock musicians - and their girlfriends - took to crime like ex-child stars .

' s Losing My Religion ' video was banned on the Emerald Isle , apparently because of its religious and homoerotic imagery , but swept this year 's MTV Video Music Awards . The event - which was seen by viewers in 140 countries - was a predictably mixed bag that began with a standing ovation for PEE-WEE HERMAN and rolled slowly downhill from there . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off ' and METALLICA 's bone-crunching rendition of Enter Sandman , ' about which drummer LARS ULRICH said : The 900 cameras did n't faze me . No one recognizes us anyway . ' <p> Where was WILSON PICKETT ? Maybe he was out driving over somebody 's lawn . The last scene of The Commitments saw the Irish rockers of the same name staying up till the midnight hour in the hopes that Pickett would jam . ( Pickett , incidentally , got into an offscreen scrape with the law in his local New Jersey this year . ) When Pickett did n't show , the COMMITMENTS finished the movie without him . The born-to- be-in-pictures band did get a noncelluloid gig with Pickett later on and watched their soundtrack break into the Top Ten . <p> Twenty-nine-year-old singer GARTH BROOKS found hisself sittin ' on top of Creation when his record Ropin ' the Wind became the first country album ever to debut at Number One on Billboard 's pop chart . Brooks , who has been known to wipe a tear or two from his eyes during live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles Times , It 's a lot easier to cash my checks at the grocery store now . ' <p> I was a nervous wreck , ' JOHN MELLENCAMP said of his gig at Carnegie Hall . I had n't been onstage in three and a half years . ' The singer-turned-painter turned singer again to try out material from his new album , Whenever We Wanted . Why Carnegie Hall ? We just thought it was nice , and the building manager was a John Mellencamp fan . ' <p> Do n't cry for PRINCE . Everyone had whispered that the singer was in a financial funk - Sinead O'Connor had even congratulated herself for saving his tiny butt with royalties from her Nothing Compares 2 U ' cover - when suddenly his name popped up on Forbes 's Top Forty **29;962;TOOLONG list next to the princely sum of $25 million . How had it happened ? Prince 's album Graffiti Bridge sold a disappointing million copies , and the accompanying movie was the punch line to an awful lot of jokes . Prince 's managers pointed to music-publishing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals , saying , There are a variety of ways he can generate income by sitting still and doing nothing . ' But Prince did not sit still . He released Diamonds and Pearls , a strong , eclectic outing that further documents the singer 's obsessive struggles with spirituality and sexuality , not to mention his desperate attempts to play catch-up with rap . <p> Does being a fervent socialist disqualify you from making the Forbes list ? It sure do n't make things easy , that 's for certain - even if you do manage to put out one of the year 's most heartfelt collections of songs . Such is the quandary for BILLY BRAGG , who released Do n't Try This at Home . And while it is the most band-oriented outpouring of emotion in his distinguished ten-year career , it probably wo n't land him on the list o ' plenty . I 'd like to thank Elektra for sticking with me in the hope that one day I might make an album that would put the fear of God in Mariah Carey and Bryan Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Of the song She 's a Girl and I 'm a Man , ' the chronically wry Cole said : I think we 've got a particularly moronic single that people may like . It 's actually got a chorus .

The only one close to the postpubescent dance-and-crooning troupe was Bill Cosby , who pulled in a hefty $113 million all by his lonesome . It now remains to be seen if the startling revelation that the Kids grossed over $1 billion in merchandising alone will lead to sharp reductions in allowance moneys or simply a massive waste-disposal crisis when nature 's inevitable fan-maturation process finally strikes . <p> Photo : Prince <p> Photo : Billy Bragg ( KEVIN MAZUR ) <p> NOTABLE NEWS <p> <p> Blue-collar poet BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN settled out of court with two former roadies who claimed he stiffed them during the Born in the U.S.A.

Promoters blamed an alarming twenty-five-percent drop in revenues on the recession , postwar jitters and a simple lack of heavyweight acts . But one thing the promoters did n't blame was the high cost of a concert ticket , which closed in on the thirty-dollar mark . Only the WARRANT and BAD COMPANY-DAMN YANKEES tours were wise enough to reduce ticket prices - and were rewarded with packed houses . <p> Agencies worked up various package tours to lure fans back into arenas , but the ploy rarely worked . Featuring acts such as PRIMUS , EPMD and FISHBONE , GATHERING OF THE TRIBES II had a great premise - uniting disparate social groups through music - but the tour , originally scheduled for about a dozen cities , played only three sparsely attended shows . And despite cult favorites SISTERS OF MERCY and PUBLIC ENEMY , the TUNE IN , TURN ON , BURN OUT Tour dropped out with nine shows to go . <p> Not everybody suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fine , as did tours by YES , QUEENSRYCHE and ELVIS COSTELLO . The PET SHOP BOYS sold out their high-concept , high-budget show in a few select cities . And audiences were winners , too - they got to see big stars in smaller than usual venues . <p> Even the most anticipated tour of the year did n't play stadiums . GUNS N ' ROSES - on their first tour as a headliner - cranked out fierce , jackhammer rock &; roll first on a surprise ' theater tour and then under the sheds with openers SKID ROW . <p> Yet for all the hoopla surrounding Guns n ' Roses , the GRATEFUL DEAD tour - the summer 's only stadium tour - was the year 's biggest , grossing nearly $20 million in the first half of 1991 alone . The Dead even sold out a phenomenal nine shows at New York 's Madison Square Garden . <p> ZZ TOP hit the road with its bawdy high-tech boogie . Critics deemed the Recycler tour a bore , but people went in droves . The tour drew headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBINSON and his nightly swipes at corporate sponsorship , the Top 's management kicked the Crowes off the bill . <p> Another success was LOLLAPALOOZA , an itinerant postpunk Woodstock masterminded by members of JANE 'S ADDICTION , who headlined what turned out to be the band 's farewell tour . The all-day show , which also featured SIOUXSIE AND THE BANSHEES , ICE-T , LIVING COLOUR , the BUTTHOLE SURFERS , NINE INCH NAILS and the HENRY ROLLINS BAND , showcased alternative acts , food , art and political views . <p> THE CLASH OF THE TITANS , featuring MEGADETH , SLAYER and ANTHRAX , was an artistic , if not financial , high point . While Anthrax warned of the apocalypse and Megadeth said it was already here , Slayer was the apocalypse . The burly Satanists stole the show , and very often , their fans stole the seats . <p> Perhaps because of a higher grade of talent , postsummer tours did a bit better . METALLICA , GEORGE MICHAEL , MORRISSEY , VAN HALEN , TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS and ROD STEWART all cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lollapalooza and the Clash of the Titans appealed to flourishing subcultures , and other successful touring acts simply had big hit records . But in the end , bands noted for their live shows were the winners - people are getting savvy about who 's best live and who 's better seen on MTV . None of which explains the man who ran a quiet third behind the Dead and the Gunners in the summer sweepstakes : the maharajah of mellow , JIMMY BUFFETT . <p> Photo : The Greatful Dead ( JAY BLAKESBERG ) <p> Photos : Above : Ice-T wows the Lollapalooza crowd .

( PAUL NATKIN/PHOTO RESERVE ) <p> <p> RAP WRAP <p> Rap 's national audience came into its own in 1991 . Sure , New York and L.A. were still the centers of the action , but it was the listeners and buyers between the coasts who made the biggest impact . <p> For proof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - N.W.A 's flight to the top of the charts . With no radio play , no video , not even a single , and minimal respect in New York , the Compton foursome 's brutal , graphic Efil4zaggin entered the pop chart at Number Two , knocked Paula Abdul out of the top spot the next week and sold a million copies in fifteen days . <p> The one L.A. rapper who has won over the East Coast is N.W.A member turned rival ICE CUBE , whose furious , sometimes offensively racist Death Certificate album came out on Halloween . Still , the coastal rivalry showed no sign of abating - when New York 's TIM DOG came out with a song titled Fuck Compton , ' it went straight to the top of the rap-singles chart . <p> After a fall from grace last year , L.L. COOL J emerged as rap 's preeminent superstar , popping up regularly on MTV and teenage girls ' bedroom walls . L.L. 's fourth platinum album , Mama Said Knock You Out , spawned two Top Twenty singles , and a mind-blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mama 's title track was easily the hardest hip-hop song ever to climb so high on the charts , and it was the clear front-runner for single of the year until a New Jersey trio named NAUGHTY BY NATURE came out with the playful O.P.P. ' This tribute to the joys of infidelity , featuring a flawlessly deployed sample from ABC ' by the Jackson Five , immediately became the consensus rap hit of 1991 . <p> We may never know how much this pop acceptance of such uncompromising raps can be attributed to the megamillion sales of M.C. HAMMER and VANILLA ICE in 1990 . In Pop Goes the Weasel , ' its own crossover smash , 3RD BASS lamented the day that hip-hop got turned into hit pop ' and argued that rappers who emphasized dance steps over rhymes held back the genre 's real talents . Others felt , however , that introducing rap in any form to so many new listeners could only help the cause . Certainly , the fact that DE LA SOUL 's deliberately anticommercial De la Soul Is Dead album could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whatever his legacy , 1991 was not a good year for Vanilla Ice . His in-concert ' album , Extremely Live , enjoyed about one-fifteenth the sales of his debut , To the Extreme . Hammer , meanwhile , dropped the M.C. ' from his recording moniker and added a superhero suffix to become Hammerman ' on a Saturday-morning cartoon . His Too Legit to Quit , which replaced his sampled hooks with live instruments to the same formulaic effect , was released at year 's end amid the biggest promotional effort ever devoted to an album . <p> Of course , goofy raps by cute non-African Americans continued to find a following in 1991 . GERARDO 's shirtless chest was the obvious key to the success of Rico Suave , ' but who could have predicted that MARKY MARK , younger brother of New Kid homeboy Donnie Wahlberg , would raise the stakes by dropping his pants at every opportunity to promote his chart-topping Good Vibrations ' ' ? Fortunately , these trifles were balanced by poppy but still funky hits by the likes of HEAVY D. AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Women to maintained a strong presence within the rap community . Though sales were initially disappointing for QUEEN LATIFAH 's eagerly awaited second album , veterans SALT-N-PEPA and MC LYTE returned with popular singles that , unlike most hits by their male counterparts in , addressed social issues . Newcomers like MONIE LOVE and Ice Cube 's tough-talking teen protegee YO-YO checked in with impressive first efforts . <p> Meanwhile , some of rap 's biggest stars were bringing metal into the mix in 1991 . ICE-T could be found fronting the black L.A. thrash band Body Count , which was the surprise smash of the Lollapalooza tour . PUBLIC ENEMY and ANTHRAX collaborated on a stomping remake of PE 's Bring the Noise , ' which turned up on both groups ' new albums , and then hooked up for a triumphant cross-country jaunt . <p> There is no such thing as an easy year for Public Enemy - administrative squabbles and recurrent breakup rumors haunted the group in 1991 . But in October , PE rocked Saturday Night Live and dropped Apocalypse 91 . . . an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album entered the pop charts in the Top Five and sold a million copies in two weeks . <p> As for Ice-T , the burgeoning multimedia star released O.G . Original Gangster , his best album to date , and stole New Jack City and Ricochet . On the Lollapalooza tour , he proved that rap has a large following among hip white teens and headbangers . <p> It was an oddly quiet year in the rap world . There was no scandal like the 2 Live Crew trial to galvanize the community , no multimillion-selling no-talents to dethrone , no brilliant newcomers to revolutionize the form . In a year of retrenchment and steady growth , Ice-T and Public Enemy left the strongest marks by winning hard-earned respect from the traditional hip-hop crowd while also drawing new rap fans from new directions . <p> Photo : This year 's success story : N.W.A ( NEAL PRESTON/OUTLINE ) <p> Photo : You down wit ' Nauty by Nature ? <p> Photo : Ice-T , rap-thrash-movie star ( JAY BLAKESBERG ) <p> Photo : Hip-hop hero L.L.

Shuman was best known for his collaborations with Doc Pomus , with whom he wrote Fifties and Sixties standards like A Teenager in Love ' This Magic Mo ment ' and Save the Last Dance for Me ' ' ; he also penned hits for Elvis Presley , including Ca n't Help Falling in Love ' and Surrender . ' In 1966 , Shuman moved to France , where he devoted himself to translating - and on occasion , performing - the music of Jacques Brel . Singing in a New York-tinged French , he scored a few hits of his own in France in the Seventies . Shuman also produced a musical , Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris , which ran on Broadway for seven years . <p> ERIC CLAPTON and GEORGE HARRISON are sharing the stage for a tour - the first in fifteen years for Harrison - of Japan . I put it to George that he go out with us , ' said Clapton . All he 's got to do is walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else . Nothing for him to worry about . I 'll probably do two or three numbers and then just step back . ' <p> The tour 's real question mark , however , is if one of those numbers might be Layla , ' the song Clapton wrote for Harrison 's then-wife Pattie , who ended up marrying Clapton . Every time I play it and he 's in the audience , I wonder what the hell goes through his mind , ' said Clapton . We could play it . We 've got a sense of humor about it .
