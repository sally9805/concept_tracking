In 1938 , when he was still struggling to find his voice as a playwright , Tom Williams , 27 , read a newspaper account of four inmates at a Pennsylvania prison who died after being left to roast inside a superheated chamber dubbed " Klondike . " The story spurred him to expand a one-act play he had written about prison life to a full-length drama he titled Not About Nightingales . Williams entered the play in a contest for young dramatists held by the famed Group Theatre . ( Since he was two years over the age limit , he lied about his birth date and signed with a pseudonym  --  Tennessee , after the state where his grandparents lived . The name stuck . ) Williams won a $100 prize for some one-acts he also submitted . But Not About Nightingales was ignored and never produced . <P> A half-century later , Vanessa Redgrave came to the rescue . While researching her role in Williams ' Orpheus Descending a few years ago , the actress discovered a reference the playwright made to his forgotten early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could compete with it in violence and horror . " She tracked down the manuscript at the University of Texas and eventually showed it to Trevor Nunn , the acclaimed British director ( Nicholas Nickleby ; Cats ) who is now artistic director of London 's Royal National Theatre . Nunn 's first reaction was surprise that there was no role in it for Redgrave . Her unearthing of the play " was a completely philanthropic gesture , " he marvels . His second reaction was that he wanted to stage it . <P> Nunn 's production had its premiere in London in March , and ( with the same cast , a mix of British and American actors ) is making its American debut at Houston 's Alley Theatre . It is a startling theatrical discovery : an impassioned social drama that is as far as one can imagine from the more personal , lyrical style that Williams introduced a few years later in The Glass Menagerie . The earlier play is something of a mess  --  more than three hours long , with too many characters and subplots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , bad Tennessee Williams ( Girl to Guy : " Why do n't you ever open the door you 're hiding behind ? " ) . But in Nunn 's taut , forceful staging , the work is more than a footnote for Williams scholars ; it 's an evening of crude but often astonishing power . <P> The young playwright shows the unlikely influence of such left-wing dramatists of the era as Clifford Odets . But he must have sat through quite a few Warner Bros. prison films of the ' 30s as well . Not About Nightingales is paced like a movie , with short scenes that skip willy-nilly from warden 's office to cell block , from mess hall to prison yard . The warden ( played with fine , greasy intensity by Corin Redgrave , Vanessa 's brother ) is a sadistic dictator with no redeeming features . The convicts include a bullet-headed tough guy who organizes a hunger strike ( James Black ) ; a sympathetically rendered homosexual called Queenie ( Jude Akuwudike ) ; and the inevitable " new boy " ( Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running on the U.S. Olympic team  --  and winds up crippled by the brutal guards .
