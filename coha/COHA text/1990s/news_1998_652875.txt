<p> SEATED BEHIND AN OAK DESK in his roomy , memorabilia-filled office , Gene Autry is thumbing through " Western Classics , " a 1947 bound volume of his 78-rpm recordings , most of them featured in his B-westerns of the 1930 's and 40 's . He is dressed as usual in a tailored western suit and ornate cowboy boots . His white , 10-gallon Stetson hangs on a nearby hatrack . " I 'll be doggoned , " Mr. Autry says in a warm voice as he inspects the album set . " ' Red River Valley , ' ' Mexicali Rose , ' ' South of the Border , ' what a great song ! That was a dandy . " <p> When another title catches his eye , he begins to sing softly : " I 'm back in the saddle again . . . " He stops midchorus with a chuckle , explaining , " I 've done ' Back in the Saddle Again ' so darn long , I could go to sleep and sing it . " <p> The song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Autry , but it has lately been given new life . This month , " Gene Autry : Sing Cowboy Sing , " a three-CD boxed set featuring " Back in the Saddle " and 83 other Autry tunes , received a Grammy nomination for best historical album . In addition to the boxed set , four CD 's featuring everything from his early blues recordings to his later children 's music have been reissued since 1996 , with more to come this year . <p> " If you stay out there long enough , " says Mr. Autry , flashing the smile he made famous in the movies , " it 'll come back in style . " <p> In fact , the western sound that Mr. Autry helped popularize has experienced something of a revival in the last few years . A recent front-page article in Billboard magazine described how the genre was thriving , thanks to a growing number of artists performing the music along with an increase in festivals and recordings featuring it . The most prominent purveyors of western music include the groups Riders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Martin Murphey , Don Edwards and Ian Tyson , half of the 60 's folk duo Ian and Sylvia . Movies have also capitalized on the trend : " The Horse Whisperer , " which will be released in May , showcases Mr. Edwards as both singer and co-star , and the 1993 hit " Sleepless in Seattle " included Mr. Autry 's " Back in the Saddle " on its multiplatinum soundtrack . <p> There are several reasons for the renewed popularity of western music . Many fans come to it from country and folk , both of which are also rooted in an acoustic tradition . As pop has moved more toward electronics and indecipherable lyrics , some people yearn for songs with simple melodies and straightforward narratives . And western music can be an antidote for the complexities of modern life . <p> " The West is the American repository of fantasy  --  the illusion of independence , the fresh air and wide-open spaces , " says Douglas B. Green , better known as Ranger Doug , the leader of Riders in the Sky , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's where we go when life gets too stressful . Gene Autry certainly exemplifies that . It 's the whole appeal of his voice , lyrics and music . " <p> Mr. Autry 's early recordings merged the western style with country music , then known as hillbilly , while his movies set the standard for the horse opera , with its white-hatted singing cowboy , heroic horse and bumbling sidekick , a format later taken up by Roy Rogers and others . Always playing himself , he projected an Everyman quality to which fans could relate . " There 's something accessible about him , " says Michael Stern , who with his wife , Jane , is the author of " Way Out West . " " He could be your neighbor or your uncle or your dad or your brother or your pal . " <p> One of the hardest-working men in show business , Mr. Autry is the only entertainer to have earned five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  --  for film , recordings , television , radio and live performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 200 of which he wrote or wrote with a partner ) , 91 episodes of " The Gene Autry Show " and 16 seasons as host of the weekly " Melody Ranch " radio show . ( The boxed set consists of excerpts from the radio series , which was broadcast from 1940 to 1956 . ) When he stopped performing in 1961 , he had already begun amassing a fortune . He owned radio and television stations , real estate and oil wells in addition to the California Angels baseball team . In 1988 , he founded the Autry Western Heritage Museum , in Los Angeles , and in 1990 he was the only entertainer named to the Forbes 400 . <p> How Mr. Autry went from small-town farm boy to multimillionaire is the stuff of Hollywood legend . He was born near Tioga , Tex. , on Sept. 29 , 1907 , to a struggling livestock dealer and his wife . His grandfather , a Baptist minister , enlisted him in the church choir at age 5 , and his mother taught him to play guitar when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working as a telegraph operator for the Frisco Railroad , Will Rogers overheard him singing and strumming the guitar and encouraged him to try his luck in New York . <p> He took his savings and followed Rogers ' advice . Nothing panned out , and a year later he took a job with a Tulsa radio station and became known as Oklahoma 's Yodelin ' Cowboy , a nod to the popular Singing Brakeman , Jimmie Rodgers . " I learned a lot from Jimmie Rodgers when I started trying to yodel , " Mr. Autry recalls . <p> He returned to New York and began recording Rodgers ' songs as well as his own raucous originals about rambling hobos , bootlegging jailbirds and loose women . " People have never given Gene Autry enough credit for the quality of his singing , " says Lawrence Cohn , who produced " Gene Autry : Blues Singer , " a 1996 reissue . " He had a magnificent voice and was an excellent yodeler . " <p> His first major success , " That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railroad buddy , Jimmy Long , sold a million copies after its release in 1931 . He became a featured performer on " National Barn Dance , " a hugely popular show broadcast on the Chicago radio station WLS , and cut a string of lush western ballads . <p> As the hits continued , he started a publishing company to retain the rights to his own songs and many of those he covered . His songwriting technique was as uncomplicated as the man . " A lot of times , somebody will say something and it will give you a good title , " he says . " So you carry a pencil with you and jot that down . You do n't just write a song right quick , though . You fool around and work with it . You have to keep going over and over it and see if you ca n't write a song that means something . That 's what I tried to write .

The next year , an Autry hit , " Tumbling Tumbleweeds , " inspired a western of the same title , which starred Mr. Autry . It became the prototype of the western movie musical . Until 1942 , when he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a pilot , he starred in six to eight movies a year . <p> After he returned from World War II and as the B-Westerns began to wane , he started a film-production company and became the first movie star to get into television . Piloting his own plane , he continued to tour with his highly profitable western variety show and turn out hit records almost until he retired . His 1949 version of " Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer " ( which he re-recorded in 1957 ) remains the second-biggest-selling single in history . <p> OVER THE LAST THREE decades , he has largely stayed out of the limelight , managing his vast business empire . One of his chief preoccupations has been his baseball team . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his second wife , Jackie Ellam Autry , whom he married in 1981 , live in the home he built in Studio City 50 years ago . She has gradually taken the reins of his business holdings , divesting many of them and recently selling 25 percent of the California Angels to Disney . " My squaw , here , " Mr. Autry says , pointing to his redheaded wife , " she manages my business . She was born in New Jersey , and I roped her and brought her out here . " <p> " He 's lying , " Mrs. Autry , 56 , responds , " because if he 'd roped me , I would have been in diapers ! " <p> In fact , she had been Mr. Autry 's banker since the 1970 's . After his wife of 48 years , Ina Mae Autry , died in 1980 , Mr. Autry and Ms. Ellam began seeing each other socially . In 1984 , Mrs. Autry spearheaded the initiative to establish the $34 million Autry Western Heritage Museum . The spacious museum , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the American West and its impact on pop culture .

" Among the 1,200 guests were several generations of well-wishers , ranging from Billy Bob Thornton and Dwight Yoakam to Bob Hope and Dale Evans . <p> " As a performer , songwriter and guitar player , Gene Autry is a study in staying power , " says Marty Stuart , the country artist and president of the Country Music Foundation .
