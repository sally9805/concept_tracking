<p> IN a remote mountain valley a few hundred yards across the Iraqi border into Iran , Comrade Cicek sits near her tent encampment with some of the 400 women guerrillas she helps train for the task of liberating Kurdistan . <p> Cicek - her name means " flower " - is 26 . She has been a Kurdish guerrilla for seven years . Her commitment is obvious . She has an 11-year-old son whom she has left in Syria to be brought up by the PKK , the radical Marxist Kurdish Workers ' Party . She rarely sees him , or her husband , who is also a PKK fighter . <p> Such dedication is the norm here , and it starts young . Sitting nearby is Sozder , a 13-year-old who joined the PKK three years ago . <p> " I do n't feel like a child . I do n't miss my toys . These are my toys , " she says , nodding to her 8.5mm Beretta and the inevitable AK-47 assault rifle she cradles . <p> " I could never be a housewife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight on until we achieve a free Kurdistan . " <p> But she and hundreds of other PKK guerrillas may be disappointed in their quest for that far-reaching goal . <p> Their revered leader , Abdullah Ocalan , known to follower and foe alike by his nickname Apo , recently launched a peace initiative that could end the PKK 's eight-year secessionist insurrection against Turkey through a political accommodation with the Ankara government . <p> Turkish leaders have shown signs of taking the initiative seriously , and are looking at ways to accommodate Kurdish aspirations without compromising the country 's unity and integrity . <p> Such a peace would mean tranquillity and a better deal for Turkey 's 12 million Kurds , whose identity has been denied for decades by Turkish authorities and whose areas in the southeast of the country have fallen into economic neglect . Shelving the dream <p> For the PKK , a peace accord with Turkey would not only mean giving up the unrelenting armed struggle it launched in 1984 , unleashing a cycle of violence and repression in which more than 5,000 people have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , independent Kurdistan embracing all the region 's 20 million Kurds , who are divided mainly between Turkey , Iran , Iraq , and Syria . Pan-Kurdism has always been at the center of the PKK 's philosophy . <p> But Kurdish leaders in Iran and Iraq express hope that an agreement in Turkey could become a model for peace negotiations in their countries . <p> Mr. Ocalan announced a unilateral halt to hostilities with Turkish government forces from March 20 through April 15 , and indicated that if Ankara responded positively , he might extend the truce indefinitely and would seek a settlement within Turkey 's borders . That is now expected to happen , given the initial success of the cease-fire and the interest Turkish leaders now show in addressing the Kurdish issue . <p> " We are very much prepared to turn to political methods , " Ocalan told a news conference in Lebanon 's eastern Bekaa Valley . " As for Turkish unity , I must say that we are not in favor of separation from Turkey for the time being . We are realistic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ploy . " <p> The PKK truce was timed to cover the Kurdish New Year , Nowruz , which in recent years has been an occasion for violent antigovernment Kurdish demonstrations and clashes with government forces in the southeast . <p> Nearly 100 people died in such disturbances last year . This time , Nowruz passed March 21 with only scattered incidents . Since then , the general level of violence has dropped sharply , reinforcing the impression that the PKK enjoys a high degree of influence in Turkey 's Kurdish areas . <p> " Even if it is unilateral , the fact that the guns have been silent has created a new climate of hope , " says Hashim Hashimi , the Kurdish mayor of Cizre , a town in southeastern Turkey where roughly 40 people were killed in Nowruz violence last year . <p> While Ankara 's response has yet to crystallize , government leaders and security chiefs have held numerous meetings and made public comments indicating willingness to explore a new deal for Turkey 's Kurds . <p> In a significant gesture , Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to you , we had a peaceful Nowruz , " he told thousands of Kurds who turned out to greet him . <p> He said the emergency rule - a sort of martial law - imposed on the Kurdish provinces five years ago may be lifted in June " if everything goes smoothly until then . " <p> Turkish leaders have indicated that among the measures being considered are the granting of " cultural rights " to the Kurds - such as TV and radio broadcasting and education in Kurdish , a language officially banned in Turkey from the time the republic was established in 1923 . <p> Interior Minister Ismet Sezgin - a hard-liner on the Kurdish issue - said that hundreds of Kurdish villages that had been forced to adopt Turkish names would have their original Kurdish names restored . Amnesty for fighters <p> Officials in Ankara reportedly also are considering easing the conditions under which PKK fighters - long denounced by Ankara as simply " terrorists " - would be allowed to come down from the mountains and rejoin society . In addition to those outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be holding out in mountain bases inside Turkey . <p> If the PKK has shelved the notion of separation , independence , and Kurdish unity in a Greater Kurdistan , the loss does not seem to be mourned by most Turkish Kurds , who are more concerned with bettering their economic lot and achieving recognition of their identity as Kurds . <p> " At present , both the people and the Kurdish parties want to live together with their Turkish brothers , rather than seek an independent state - provided they 're granted their basic rights , " Mayor Hashimi says . <p> If Turkey 's Kurds gain new status and accommodation from Ankara , its impact will be felt well beyond Turkey 's border . Among those most directly affected will be the 4 million Iraqi Kurds in the self-proclaimed " federal state " they set up in northern Iraq last year . A model for Iran , Iraq <p> Landlocked and heavily dependent on Turkey as their main lifeline to the outside world , the Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas last autumn joined Turkish forces in ousting PKK fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious of the Iraqi Kurdish " state , " fearing it may encourage separatism among its own Kurds . <p> Helping bring about a settlement of the Kurdish problem in Turkey is clearly in the interest of the Iraqi Kurds . Not surprisingly , therefore , one of the main Iraqi Kurdish leaders , Jalal Talabani , played a key role in preparing the way for Ocalan 's initiative , and sat at his side as he launched it . <p> Rebel Iranian Kurds also have welcomed the PKK 's change of direction , believing a settlement in Turkey could provide a model for Iran 's 6 million Kurds . <p> " I very much hope that Turkish officials will respond positively , and that all people of goodwill will cooperate to solve the Kurdish question in Turkey within the framework of an independent and unified Turkey , which might be an example to the Kurds of Iran and elsewhere , " said Abdullah Hassanzadeh , deputy leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran , in an interview at a remote mountain base on the Iraq-Iran border . <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hassanzadeh believes the dream of eventual Kurdish unity is still alive in the heart of almost every Kurd - but that goal is not at the forefront today . <p> " We must be realistic , we must use our brains and be wise , " says Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani . " The Kurdish issue can not be solved by violence , either by us or by the governments of the countries we are divided among . This does not mean we do n't have the right to have our free , independent country , but this must be achieved through dialogue and peace , not through violence . " <p> awed Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran , also want autonomy . "  --  Shown , selected countries in the Middle East with Turkey highlighted. , NO CREDIT
