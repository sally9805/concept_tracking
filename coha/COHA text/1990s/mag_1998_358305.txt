It 's an eerie sensation to read Jane Smiley 's prankish new novel , set in pre-Civil War Kansas , after campaigning with the fiery abolitionist John Brown through the same time and terrain in Russell Banks ' thunderous epic Cloudsplitter . The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton ( Knopf ; 448 pages ; $26 ) follows Lidie , a sturdy young Illinois bride , to the dust-blown outpost of Lawrence , Kans. , in the tumultuous year of 1855 . Lawrence is a raw , ill-favored roost of newly arrived Free Soil settlers , jostled by drunken proslave irregulars from Missouri and protected , mostly with words , by gassy politicians . John Brown and his terrible sons , the focus of Banks ' harsh panorama , are just out of sight in Smiley 's account , raiding and murdering . <P> Lidie is chunky and unbeautiful , but no fool , and handy with rifle and horse . When her naive husband is killed by proslave thugs , she sets out to avenge him . As she relates breezily in her journal ( each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's A Treatise on Domestic Economy for the Use of Young Ladies at Home and at School ) , female dress becomes a hindrance . Miss Beecher recommends self-reliance and deplores corsets , and Lidie , therefore , disguises herself as a boy . This works long enough to take her to a plantation in slave country but fails when she has a miscarriage . Further adventures set down by Smiley , author of A Thousand Acres , include an unwelcome marriage proposal from a doddering plantation owner and a threatened death sentence for stealing a slave . Lidie prevails and returns to Illinois , having , like the beguiled reader , seen an astonishing array of clamor and calamity . <P>  --  J.S.
