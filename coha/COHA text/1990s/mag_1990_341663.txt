Of all the cards Saddam Hussein was holding as he attempted to stave off the U.S. and its allies , the strongest was the thousands of Americans , Britons and other foreign nationals held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait . <P> Last week he played it . As the speaker of Iraq 's parliament sarcastically put it , " The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with an aggressive war . " They would be housed , he said , in military and civilian installations that would be likely U.S. targets if an armed conflict developed . <P> With that Baghdad put an end to all the pussyfooting about just what the status of these foreigners was . They were not , as the Iraqis had said before , mere " restrictees . " They were hostages , pure and simple . <P> For governments with nationals caught in Saddam 's grip , the announcement was the realization of three weeks of dread . Despite the drawn-out foreplay , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The U.N . Security Council agreed unanimously that U.N . Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar should immediately work to gain the release of the foreigners . But his main weapon is moral suasion , something Saddam Hussein seems immune to . <P> For weeks the states vulnerable to hostage taking had kept discussions of the issue sotto voce , hoping to leave room for Saddam to release the foreigners without needing to get something in return . Though that hope was extinguished , Washington remained purposefully low key . President Bush called the Iraqi move " totally unacceptable " and urged Baghdad to " immediately reconsider " it  --  moderate words in light of the circumstances . " Our attitude , " said a White House official , " is that we should not make the situation seem to be any worse than it is . " <P> The British , on the other hand , were no longer holding their tongues . Iraq 's ambassador to Britain was summoned to the Foreign Office and given a 20-minute dressing down . Publicly , Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd denounced Baghdad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . " The threats to foreign nationals , he stressed , " will not deter us " from continuing efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait . <P> Those efforts , however , have certainly been made more complicated . The U.S. will be loath to do anything to provoke Saddam into getting even nastier with the hostages . If , for example , the trade embargo begins to create widespread hunger in Iraq , the ban on food imports probably will be eased . " The U.N . resolution on sanctions does not support a starvation strategy , " a senior White House official emphasized . In fact , the resolution specifically cites food as a permissible exception if a " humanitarian " consideration arises . <P> Baghdad played to this issue when officials asserted that if food and medicine shortages occur , foreigners will suffer along with Iraqis . " If there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies , then the same calamity affecting the Iraqi newborns will affect similarly the foreign babies , " said a government statement . It claimed that already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner that we wish . "
