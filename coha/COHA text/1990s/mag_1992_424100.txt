An infusion of red can bring the border to life <p> Everywhere I go I see white gardens , borders of silver and gray , and gentle washes of pastel perennials . Much of this horticultural anemia , I think , is due to the influence of English garden makers , whose dictates are interpreted to mean that color is crass and bland is beautiful . As a change from strident rows of red-hot salvias , such subtlety is indeed refreshing , but very soon it begins to pall . What , after all , is wrong with red ? <p> The positive contribution made by red in the garden is too seldom recognized . The shimmering compositions of pink , blue , lavender , and silver that fill many a tasteful border often fail to hold our interest because they lack depth and definition . A judicious dose of the right red can pull such soft-focus scenes together , bringing them to life the way a shower of sparks enlivens embers and ashes . A border of Claryssa Hybrids ' sages ( Salvia viridis ) , pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creamy verbascums will make a pleasing mass , but there is nothing there to hold the eye . Back it with murky-red smokebush ( Cotinus coggygria Royal Purple ' or Velvet Cloak ' ) , mix in some red-leaved sweet William , a bit of Rosa rubrifolia , and a few Rubine ' Brussels sprouts , and the color scheme becomes fascinatingly complex . Details once overpowered by the silvery glare will come to the fore , and however long one admires the scene , there will be something more to notice . <p> A shot of red can also alter the way we look at individual plants . Sculptural masses of ice-blue oat grass ( Helictotrichon sempervirens ) or Festuca glauca Silberreiher ' are handsome enough but are read by the eye in a split second . Run a thick rope of red-leaved grapevine ( Vitis vinifera Purpurea ' ) through the grasses and the picture will alter dramatically , the focus shifting from the architecture of the group to the contrasts of color , character , and texture of the plants themselves . <p> When we are seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is natural to think in terms of flowers . However , to only consider flowers is to overlook the obvious . Flaming foliage , red as rubies , looks as striking in a bed or border as any blossom , and it is far less fleeting . And while it 's true that only a handful of plants have leaves of true scarlet or clear crimson , a surprising number are touched with garnet , mahogany , or cedar . Once one begins to seek them out , they appear in profusion in all sizes : bugleweeds and sedums , phloxes and penstemons , roses and weigelas , maples and honeylocust . In warm climates , tender red hebes and tall spiky phormiums thrive , while red grasses , such as blood grass , fountain grass , panic grass , and pampas grass , will grow almost anywhere . Even common weeds come in prized red forms , from plantain ( Plantago major Rubrifolia ' ) to wood sorrel ( Oxalis hedysaroides Rubra ' ) . Nearly every nursery holds some part of this underutilized foliar treasure . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red foliage glows . Mexican cardinal flower ( Lobelia splendens Illumination ' ) , for instance , with its glossy , red-black leaves and stems , commands attention from the time it first emerges in spring . In late summer the flowers arrive  --  rocketing spires of flame-red blossoms that further enhance the show . Penstemon Husker Red ' has similar foliage , but its blossoms are a faint pink veined with rose . Both plants bloom long and hard in the shade , leaves and flowers alike making a striking contrast to a sea of green . <p> Several heucheras with red leaves are available , the showiest of which is the hybrid Palace Purple ' . Its burgundy foliage backed with lacquer red is irresistible , but it is a hard plant to place effectively . Its gorgeous leaves tend to scorch in full sun yet are practically invisible in the shade . ( One solution is to grow it where it is sheltered at noon and illuminated early and late in the day . ) Combine it with streamers of blood grass ( Imperata cylindrica Rubra ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will burn brilliantly behind Palace Purple ' all summer . Ajuga Burgundy Glow ' , variegated in rose red , cream , and sage , will repeat the red tints at ground level . <p> Clear , soft yellows are most often used among brighter shades , but when mixed with certain reds , these gentle tones are elevated to star status . The muted ember-red of Sedum maximum Atropurpureum Honeysong ' brings the greenish-yellow lacecaps of Patrinia triloba to center stage , while the clarion-red leaves of Lobelia Queen Victoria ' highlight chalky ambers like those of Achillea Hope ' or the paler A. taygetea . The combination of chalky yellows with strong reds is far happier than with mustards , their more frequent partner , for they make most reds look luminous rather than opaque and heavy . The ash-red sempervivum Bella Donna ' is lifted from shadow to prominence by a companionable mat of citrus-yellow Achillea tomentosa Nana ' , while the screaming-red dwarf gladiolus Amanda Mahy ' is tempered to mere brilliance by a froth of cool-yellow Dianthus knappii . <p> Both copper and purple-reds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange-reds . The young foliage of the luscious tea rose Just Joey ' , red-gold as a new penny , first suggested the success of such combinations to me . Textured like heavy silk , with petals the color of ginger and cream , the rose looks even more elegant echoed by daylilies in shades of peach and apricot , and flanked by pewtery Ruta Blue Beauty ' . A soaring stand of red orach ( Atriplex hortensis ) makes a dark screen against which the blues and apricots sing . <p> Warm reds can be used in more explosive combinations by stepping up the color wattage of the flowers involved . Lychnis Xarkwrightii Vesuvius ' is a shocking plant with red-tinged leaves and orange-red flowers borne in loose round heads . The glazed black stems and wine-dark leaves of the somber Ligularia dentata Othello ' make a supportive background for this volcanic perennial , and its orange daisylike flowers increase the heat of the combination . An underplanting of hot reds and oranges will carry the color theme down to the ground , where tufts of black mondo grass ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverbently with red coleus and the vivid , tomato-red blossoms of the dwarf daylily Odd Fellow ' . <p> While reds in the salmon-orange range look harsh among silvery companions , they do wonders for the sulky maroon foliage of purple hazel ( Corylus maxima Purpurea ' ) , deep-red European elder ( Sambucus nigra Purpurea ' ) or dusky-red orach . Both Vesuvius ' lychnis and Just Joey ' roses are knockouts paired with any of these plants , as is the annual amaranth Joseph 's Coat ' . This amaranth 's huge leaves , streaked with hot red , warm pink , cream , and green , are definitely eye catching , but not easy to place well . <p> At season 's end , the strawberry-pink of dying peony foliage reminds one that red foliage can be a sometime thing . The leaves of the old-fashioned shrub Forsythia suspensa color delightfully , making an excellent setting for the late blossoms of the buttery rose Golden Wings ' . Most dogwoods put on a terrific , if evanescent , show in the fall , but two varieties  --  Cherokee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition . The foliage of Daybreak ' , already variegated in rose , white , and green , deepens to cream and crimson , while the gold-and-green variegated leaves of Sunset ' heat up through peach and copper to a bright , brassy red that lingers for weeks . A few annuals , such as godetia plants , turn clear scarlet in late August , and the easily naturalized hardy Geranium robertianum becomes an incandescent red . Several sumacs and a good number of vines color reliably in the fall , as do lots of species roses . The briefest tour around the fall garden will reveal similar turncoats , some universal , others specific to soil , site , or weather conditions . <p> Vivid-red foliage can underscore similar-colored stamens or stems , while subtle reds can temper more powerful tints . Red rouses chilly pastels , gives depth to shimmering grays , clarifies cloudy blues , and purifies muddy oranges . Just as American palates , long accustomed to safe and simple foods , have come to appreciate the tingling qualities of jalapeno peppers , our color sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens . <p> TABLE <p> PHOTO : Flowers are n't the only way to obtain a satisfying dose of color in the border ; foliage can offer a refreshing and longer-lasting option . Here , the burgundy leaves of Heuchera Palace Purple ' lend substance and contrast to the narrow ribbons of Miscanthus sinensis var. purpurascens , while enhancing the maroon-tinged undersides and red stems of Ligularia Desdemona ' . The nearly black blossoms of Dianthus barbatus continue the theme against a background of Ilex crenata Green Island ' .

The white-edged petals of a Marth Washington geranium vary and complete this well-composed scene . ( CYNTHIA WOODYARD <p> PHOTO : The red-and-yellow-splashed leaves of the annual Amaranthus Joseph 's Coat ' are difficult to place well , but look resplendent against a soothing background of green .
