" Uh ... Ahem ! " I coughed to get Grandpa 's attention . " I hear the chinook are in ! " <p> A second or two passed before the old man looked up from his morning paper . " What ? " he asked , absentmindedly . " Did you say something about chinook ? " <p> " I said , or meant to say , they 're already catching springers down by Coos Bay . " <p> " Who told you that ? " <p> " Clyde . He said a couple of guys came into the gas station and had four nice ones . " <p> " Were they caught inside the jetty or over the bar ? " <p> " I do n't know . Clyde did n't say . " <p> " Hmmm , " murmured Grandpa . " This bears lookin ' into . I 'll bet they were over the bar . But if anybody knows , Andy will . Look up his phone number for me , will ya ' kid ? I 'll call him right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going fishing tomorrow . So get your gear ready . We 'll also need to pick up salmon tags to be legal . Do n't let me forget . " With that , Grandpa went back to his newspaper , leaving me to guess what was going on . <p> " Do n't you think you ought to tell me where we 're going and what we 're planning to fish for ? " I asked . <p> " Oh , sure , " Grandpa answered with a grin . " We 're going with Andy over the bar in the ocean to catch some of those chinooks you 've been talking about . So get the 17-pound-test line , 2-ounce sinkers , and some eggs out of the freezer , too . I 'm sure Andy 'll have herring , but we might run out . " <p> Grandpa picked up his paper again , then set it down and looked at me . " You know , kid , there 's an article here about how TV retards the brain 's ability to concentrate . You watch a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Aw , Grandpa , " I began , but he held up his hand to stop me . " Well , let 's give it a test . I have a problem for you to solve : when 's the safest time for us to go over the Coos River bar tomorrow ? You have 15 minutes . " <p> I quickly looked up the month and date in the tidebook for the Umpqua River bar . A minus tide of .4 feet was listed for 7:37 in the morning ; the highest tide , at 8.7 feet , was listed for 1:34 in the afternoon . That meant the slack tide would begin around 8 A.M. and last for a few hours . And the flood , or incoming , tide would gradually start after 10:30 A.M. and get stronger until shortly before 2 P.M. <p> Since it was dangerous to go over the bar in a small boat during the ebb , or outgoing , tide , all the fishermen I knew crossed over at the slack tide , fished for 5 or 6 hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , after making adjustments in minutes and feet from the Umpqua River bar to the Coos River bar , I reasoned we 'd be safest going at 7:30 A.M. I reported my arithmetic to Grandpa . <p> " Sounds pretty close to me , kid . The only thing left to worry about now is the weather . Today 's paper says a front might move in tomorrow but it does n't say when . So we better check with the Coast Guard tomorrow morning . " <p> The next day found us down at Andy 's house on a hill overlooking the Coos River . The sky was overcast and the wind was out of the northwest , but only a few whitecaps showed on some wide stretches of the river . <p> " Does n't look good ! " said Andy , as he glanced up at the sky and greeted us at the same time . " The ocean 's supposed to be angry today . I checked with the Coast Guard but they have n't put out any flags yet . So the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough , we 'll just come back in . " <p> Fifteen minutes later we were aboard Andy 's 18-footer , motoring out toward the jetties and the bar . The swells were already deep , and the farther out we went , the deeper they got . About a dozen boats were visible , but they tended to disappear whenever we entered a deep trough . <p> It took us a while to approach the bar and glimpse the churning ocean beyond . What greeted our eyes were whitecaps rising as far as we could see . Despite the low ceiling , a stiff breeze prevailed , so there was n't any fog to speak of and visibility was at least 5 miles . But that does n't mean much at the entrance to a river bar . A fog can come up in minutes and reduce visibility to zero . <p> This day , however , we were spared such drama . Just as we got to within 150 yards of the open ocean , a U.S. Coast Guard cutter zoomed by us as though we were standing still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no point in going any farther . That cutter 's out here to chase everybody inside the jetties . " <p> Grandpa looked a little disappointed but his question did n't show it . " Well , if we ca n't go over the bar , let 's change the game plan . What about fishing these jetties ? " <p> Andy smiled broadly . " That 's exactly what I had in mind , too . We can mooch herring for a while and see what turns up . We 'll start at the end of the jetty and drift with the incoming tide about 50 feet off the rocks . I 'll keep the engine going in case a wild wave tries to shove us toward the jetty . There 're all kinds of fish in here  --  lingcod , greenling , cabezon , bass , rockfish , flounder , sole , and at least four species of perch . With three of us fishing we ought to do all right . " <p> " What kind of rig do we need , Andy ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have any other kind of gear . " <p> Andy gestured toward a locker . " Do n't worry ! There 're all kinds of tackle in there . We 'll fix you up . " After rummaging around a minute he handed me a complete outfit , saying , " Since you asked , here 's what you 've got : 10-pound-test line , two hooks with 36-inch leaders , a 2-ounce sinker , and the smallest herring I could buy . Now , bait up , kid , and cast about 10 feet away from that jetty ! " <p> While Grandpa and Andy talked I baited my hooks and made a cast into the murky waters near the bar . I could feel the sinker roll on the bottom for a second or two , but because we were still idling , I lost all feeling in the line . As the boat bobbed up and down ( the perfect mooching motion ) I just held my rod , hoping something would find the bait down near the bottom . <p> Several minutes passed and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move along the jetty . As we did , I saw my line go the opposite way , and I struck hard . I played the fish for a while and then reeled in as fast as I could . When I hoisted the fish aboard , I found I had two different species  --  a greenling and a pink perch  --  both the same size and weighing around 2-1/2 pounds apiece . <p> As soon as I landed my two fish Andy and Grandpa began reeling in with their rods bent . It was n't long before I caught another greenling and noticed the greenish tinge of its flesh . I asked Grandpa if you could eat green fish . He laughed and replied , " I 'll take every one you put into the boat , kid . What you do n't know is that as soon as you start cooking them the meat turns white . " <p> We 'd been fishing less than half an hour and already each of us had caught several species , including pogies , or surf perch , and silver perch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jetty , Andy kept the engine in neutral and made a running commentary on what kind of crabs , small clams , and mussels provided food for the fish and what holes they were likely to be in . <p> Over the next hour we finished drifting the south jetty , motored back out near the bar , and crossed over to the north jetty . Andy told us that almost to the edge of the bar there was a great hole the local anglers like to troll through because a lot of big fish are caught there . <p> Andy gunned his motor and sent the boat into a huge swell in order to come around so we could drift through the hole while heading toward shore . It took a few minutes , during which time I could see twenty or more boats out on the ocean , all heading in . The sea was really rough , and as the waves built up and crashed onto the jetties , the noise was almost deafening . But we were still 100 yards from the rough water and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out more line , and Grandpa and I did . I had probably pulled about 60 feet from my reel when my line began sizzling through the guides . I tried to set the hook , but in the next second I felt the line break . Whatever had taken my bait was so big a 10-pound-test line did n't even begin to slow it down . <p> Andy had been maneuvering the boat and Grandpa was watching his own rod tip . The break-off happened so fast neither had seen it . So when I reeled in the slackline and showed it to them all kinds of speculation followed . <p> " Wow ! " exclaimed Andy . " You must 've tangled with that 4-foot lingcod that lives in that hole . Either that or a mighty hungry chinook . " <p> Grandpa got into the discussion by saying , " There 's so many possibilities , it 's difficult to say what kind of fish could have come into this river . I 'd guess it could be a coho , a chinook , a steelhead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . " <p> We spent the better part of an hour working our way down the north jetty and picked up a half dozen fish between us . This time we got two flounders along with greenling and a rockfish . When we reached the end of the jetty , Andy asked if we wanted to make another run at the big hole . Grandpa and I both nodded yes , so we started down the jetty again to where we 'd turn around and fish our way back . Twenty minutes later Andy yelled , " Get ready ! " and we began our drift through the deep hole . <p> Halfway through , Grandpa 's rod tip dipped and he had a fish hooked . Then I got a bite and set the hook . Both of us were dancing around , trying to keep out of each other 's way and still keep our fish on . I had let out close to 150 feet , thinking if I got another hard hit , the slack might keep the line from breaking . <p> So when Grandpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , it looked like the catch of the day . Meanwhile I was still reeling in and had a long way to go . <p> I did n't think the fish I had on was big . It felt like one of the perch I had landed earlier . So I was unprepared for what happened . As I lifted my fish out of the murky depths I gasped : it was 18 inches of the ugliest , most prehistoric looking thing I 'd ever seen alive . <p> " What is this ? " I asked , holding the fish as though it were radioactive . <p> Andy laughed . " Today 's your lucky day , " he said . " You caught an Irish Lord ! " <p> " A what ? " <p> " An Irish Lord , " repeated Grandpa . " And a pretty nice one , too . " <p> " Anything that ugly ca n't be pretty or nice , " I protested . <p> " That 's why they 're called Irish Lords , " Grandpa replied . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's land and set up English-born Lords to control them . The Irish have resented it ever since , and an Irishman named that fish . So , along with your prize , you also hooked some Irish wit . " <p> Andy echoed Grandpa , using an improvised Irish accent : " Ye never know what ye 'll catch , lad . Some days it 's salmon ; other days ' t is a history lesson . " Then he got serious . " Right now I 'm worried about catching pneumonia . It 's getting rougher and a fog 's moving in . I think we better go home . " <p> The last words I remember were Grandpa 's " Aye , aye , captain ! Full speed ahead ! " After that Andy went to full throttle while I turned my back to the bow and , for the next half hour , thought about what I 'd learned . <p> We 'd started out the day expecting to fish for a great gamefish , the chinook salmon . But the weather changed and we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " something " turned out to be several good-eating fish , a pleasant day on the water , some unexpected action , and a new awareness that I found considerably more rewarding than any one day 's limit of salmon . By letting myself be open to a new experience , I had gotten a completely different picture of the variety of fish that live along Oregon 's rocky coastline . Never again would I view the coast as a one-dimensional postcard , with spectacular waves crashing against picturesque rocks and beaches . Now I knew there were all kinds of fish in those waves . And best of all , I knew how to catch them . <p>
