Section : Business Getting beyond race takes more than a program in the workplace . An excerpt from a new book BY ELLIS COSE <p> IN THE ETHICS OF LIVING JIM Crow , ' an autobiographical essay published in Uncle Tom 's Children in 1940 , Richard Wright told of his first job at an eyeglass lens-grinding company in Jackson , Mississippi . He landed the job , in part , because the boss was impressed with his education , and Wright was promised an opportunity to advance . I had visions of working my way up . Even Negroes have those visions , ' wrote Wright . But even though he did his best to please , he discovered , over time , that nobody was teaching him a skill . His attempts to change that only provoked outrage . Finally , a co-worker shook his fist in Wright 's face and advised him to stop making trouble : This is a white man 's work around here , and you better watch yourself . ' <p> Such sentiments obviously would not be openly voiced in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Still , it seems that every so often we get ugly reminders  --  of which the Texaco imbroglio is the latest  --  that Jim Crow 's spirit is not yet dead . In 1994 , Denny 's restaurant chain agreed  --  in a settlement with the Justice Department  --  to put a civil rights monitor on its payroll and to cough up $45 million in damages , after a slew of complaints alleging discrimination against customers and employees . The previous year Shoney 's , another restaurant chain , settled a suit for over $100 million that alleged , among other things , that managers were told to keep the number of black employees down in certain neighborhoods . <p> People of color with training and experience are treated like s  --  t in too many places on the job , ' said assistant labor secretary Bernard Anderson , whose responsibilities include the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs . Even within the labor department , said Anderson , he had seen racial prejudice . When a black colleague , a Rhodes scholar , appointed two other blacks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowered and encouraged by all of this , ' recalled Anderson , but a number of the white lawyers ... were just shaking in their boots . ' By and by , he said , a poison pen memorandum ' found its way around the department . The missive made insulting , scatological comments , questioned the credentials of the people who had been appointed , and declared that affirmative action had gone too far . <p> Resentment against minorities often surfaces in places where diversity ' or affirmative action programs are in place . And that resentment often breeds resistance that results not merely in nasty comments but in outright sabotage . <p> Some time ago , the black employees of a large , international corporation invited me to talk about a previous book , The Rage of a Privileged Class , at a corporate-wide event . In talking with my hosts , I quickly discovered that they were not merely interested in my insights . They wanted me to send a message to the management . They were frustrated because a corporate affirmative-action program , of which the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mid-level managers , it turned out , got diversity points for hiring or promoting minorities , but the corporation had defined minorities in such a way that everyone who was not a U.S.-born white man qualified . In other words , the managers got as much credit for transferring white men from Europe , Australia , and Canada as they did for promoting African Americans . And that is exactly what they were doing , according to the black employees , who wanted me to let the management know , in a nice and subtle way , that such behavior was unacceptable . <p> I 'm not sure what message the management ended up extracting from my speech , but I am sure that the frustrations those black employees felt are widespread  --  and that the cause lies less in so-called diversity programs than in the widespread tendency to judge minority group members more by color than by ability . <p> Some two decades ago , I received a brutal lesson in how galling such attitudes can be . At the time , I was a young ( maybe twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though I had only been in the business a few years , I was acquiring something of a regional reputation.I hoped to break into magazine writing by garnering a few freelance assignments from Esquire magazine , so I had made an appointment with one of its editors . <p> The editor with whom I met was a pleasant and rather gracious man , but what he had to say was sobering . He was n't sure , he confided , how many black readers Esquire had , but was reasonably certain the number was not high . Since I had not inquired about his readership , the statement took me a bit by surprise . I had been a longtime reader of Esquire , and it had never previously occurred to me that I was not supposed to be , that it was not me whom Esquire had in mind as an audience  --  never mind as a contributor . I do n't know whether the editor bothered to read my clippings , but then , the clips were somehow superfluous ; the very fact that I had written them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young black guy , and since Esquire was not in need of a young black guy , they were not in need of me . I left that office in a state of controlled fury  --  not just because the editor had rejected me as a writer , but because he had been so busy focusing on my race that he was incapable of seeing me or my work . <p> A nominal commitment to diversity does not necessarily guarantee an appreciably better outcome , as I came to see several years ago when I was approached by a newspaper publisher who was in the process of putting together his management team . He was interested , he said , in hiring some minority senior managers , so I gave him some names of people who might be likely candidates . Over the next several months , I watched as he put his team in place  --  a team , as it turned out , that was totally white . Only after he had largely assembled that group did he begin serious talks with some of the nonwhites I had recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did want to hire some minority managers , and eventually did so . But what was clear to me was that to him , minority recruitment apparently meant the recruitment of people who could n't be trusted with the organization 's most important jobs . His first priority was hiring people who could do the work  --  meaning whites  --  and only after that task was complete would he concern himself with the window dressing of diversity . <p> Over the years , I have learned that affirmative action in theory and affirmative action in practice are two different things . In the real world it is much more than simply opening up an organization to people who traditionally have been excluded ; it is attempting , usually through some contrived measures , to make organizations do what they do n't do naturally  --  and it goes down about as easily as castor oil . Shortly after I announced my resignation as editor of the editorial pages of the New York Daily News , I took one of my white staff members out to lunch . He told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me go . He had cringed when he heard that I was coming , he confided , for he had feared that I would be just another affirmative action executive , presumably incapable of doing the job competently . He admitted that he had been pleasantly surprised . <p> I was pleased but also saddened by his confession  --  pleased that he felt comfortable enough to tell me how he truly felt and saddened that the very fact that a person of color got a high-ranking job would lead him ( as it had led so many before him ) to question that person 's credentials . Yet , having occasionally been the target of affirmative-action recruiters , I am fully aware that ( whatever they may say in public ) they do n't always pay as much attention to credentials as to color . Therefore , I understand clearly why even the ostensible beneficiaries of such recruitment tactics may find affirmative action , as practiced by major corporations , distasteful and even offensive . A decade and a half ago , for instance , I received a call from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbally tap dancing for several minutes , essentially asked whether I wished to be considered for a job as a corporate director of equal opportunity . I was stunned , for the question made no sense . I was an expert neither on personnel nor on equal-employment law ; I was , however , black , which seemed to be the most important qualification . I laughed and told him that I saw my career going in another direction . Still , I wondered just how serious the inquiry could be , since I seemed ( to me , at least ) so unsuited for the position . Since then , I have received other calls pushing jobs that have seemed every bit as outlandish . <p> At one point , a man called to discuss the presidency of a major foundation . I confessed I did n't understand why he was calling me , and he assured me that the client was extremely interested in having me apply . The man 's earnestness intrigued me enough that I sent him a resume . I never heard from him again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his interest was anything but genuine . I imagined him sitting in his office with a long list of minority candidates , from whom he would collect resumes and promptly bury them in a file , merely so that his clients would be able to say they had considered minorities . Indeed , when the foundation head was finally named ( he was a white man with a long professional association with the foundation trustees ) , it was clear to me that the supposed search had been a sham . After one takes a few such calls , one realizes that the purpose is often defensibility ( Yes , we took a hard look at fifteen minority candidates , but none quite fit the bill ' ' ) and that the supposed high-level position is merely bait to attract the interest of people who do n't really have a shot  --  but in whom everyone must pretend they are interested because an affirmative-action program is in place . <p> It 's logical to argue for the replacement of such shameful practices with something better  --  for some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meritocracy generally ignore the reality of how a real-world so-called meritocracy works . If qualified , capable , and talented minorities and women exist , they say , corporations will reward them because they will recognize that it is within their economic interest to do so . That may well be true . But it is also true that effective executives are trained , not born . They come about because companies make an investment in them , in their so-called human capital , and nurture their careers along  --  and if corporations only see the potential in white men , those are the people in whom the investments are likely to be made . <p> John Kotter , a Harvard Business School professor and author of The General Managers , discovered that effective executives generally benefited from what he called the success syndrome . ' They were constantly provided with opportunities for growth : They never stagnated for significant periods of time in jobs where there were few growth possibilities . ' The executives also , to be blunt about it , are often people of relatively modest intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . <p> A true meritocracy would do a much better job of evaluating and choosing a broader variety of people . It would challenge the very way merit is generally imputed and , in giving people ample opportunity to develop and to prove themselves , it would create a truly level playing field . <p> Simply eliminating affirmative action would not bring such a true meritocracy about . Indeed , a large part of the reason affirmative action is so appealing to so many people is that a meritocracy that fully embraces people of color seems out of reach ; and affirmative action is at least one method to get people to accept the fact that talent comes in more than one color . <p> Yet , by its very nature , affirmative action is polarizing . Would n't it be better , argue a growing number of Americans , to let it die in peace ? A chorus of conservative critics even invoke the dream of Martin Luther King Jr . to make the case . <p> King would probably be more astonished than anyone to hear that conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have embraced his dream of a color-blind world and invoke it as proof of the immorality and undesirability of gender and racial preferences . But even if he had a bit of trouble accepting his status as a general in the war against affirmative action , he would appreciate the joke . And he would realize that it is the fate of the dead to be reborn as angels to the living . King no doubt would be pleased to have new friends in his fight for justice , but he would approach them with caution . After sharing his disappointment over past alliances with people whose commitment to change did not match his own , King would address his new associates bluntly . All right , ' he might say , I understand why you oppose affirmative action . But tell me : What is your plan ? What is your plan to cast the slums of our cities on the junk heaps of history ? What is your program to transform the dark yesterdays of segregated education into the bright tomorrows of high-quality , integrated education ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make justice roll down like water and righteousness flow like a mighty stream from every city hall and statehouse in this great and blessed nation ? ' He might then pause for a reply , his countenance making it unmistakably clear that he would accept neither silence nor sweet nothings as an answer . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Children with their arms raised <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Separate , unequal : Jim Crow may be history , but his spirit has not died <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A legacy of hope : Black men and boys at the Million Man March <p>
