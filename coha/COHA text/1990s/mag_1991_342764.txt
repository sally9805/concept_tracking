The Senate ethics committee hearings on the so-called Keating Five staggered into the final stretch last week with cross-examination of Republican John McCain and Democrat John Glenn . Of the five Senators accused of granting special favors to indicted S &L; tycoon Charles Keating in exchange for political contributions , McCain and Glenn were considered the least culpable by the committee 's special counsel . Yet both men struggled under tough questioning . <P> A befuddled McCain conceded that he may not have fully repaid Keating for private-jet flights taken by his family . And a hollow-eyed Glenn solemnly acknowledged writing on Keating 's behalf to S &L; regulators at times when Keating was contributing to his campaigns . <P> This week Democrats Donald Riegle , Dennis DeConcini and , probably , the ailing Alan Cranston will be grilled in the final act of a saga in which none of the five has done himself  --  or the Senate  --  proud .
