To the list of such automotive pioneers as Henry Ford , father of the moving assembly line , Charles Kettering , inventor of the self-starter , and Harold Sperlich , developer of the minivan , add J. David Power III , popularizer of customer satisfaction . You do n't think Power belongs in the same league with these guys ? Consider this : Since Power published his first Customer Satisfaction Index ( CSI ) in 1981 , keeping customers happy has become a major goal not only for automakers and dealers but also for a good-size chunk of U.S. business . He has helped make " customer satisfaction " part of the language . A search of Nexis , the publications and wire service database , shows nearly 10,000 references to the term since Power 's first study appeared . In autodom , scoring high in the Power rankings has become a preoccupation , celebrated in national advertising and rewarded with higher profits . For four years Honda 's Acura dealers festooned the windows of the Integra and Legend with decals reading " J.D. Power &; Associates No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch sales accelerate . Nissan declares that customer satisfaction " is at the heart of everything we do . " When it launched its luxury Infiniti division , it made customer satisfaction an explicit aim  --  above sales , profits , and market share . That Infiniti succeeded in only tying for first place with another new Japanese entry , Toyota 's Lexus , dampened its ardor not at all . ( This year 's CSI winner will be announced in June . ) Says George Borst , vice president of strategic and product planning for Toyota 's U.S. sales operation : " Power discovered a niche in the industry many years ago , when it was n't the top-line issue that it is today , and quantified it . Whether he caused it or caught the wave is n't important . " William Pochiluk , who runs the Autofacts consulting firm in West Chester , Pennsylvania , is even more emphatic . Says he : " I think Power has changed the auto business forever . There was a time when he was the only guy in the business making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumers . " Now there are all of 12 Power studies that measure the performance of automakers and their dealers . ( The top finishers in five of the most important rankings are shown in the tables . ) Last year Power launched the first Canadian CSI . This fall his name should appear on the first Japanese CSI rating luxury cars , produced as part of a joint venture with Japan 's Research &; Development Inc . Negotiations are under way to set up similar ventures in Europe and Australia . An attempt to establish a European beachhead in Britain failed in the late 1980s , so Power is now aiming to set up operations on the Continent . Expansion has helped fuel a rapid increase in J.D. Power &; Associates ' revenues , which are expected to reach $22.5 million this year . That 's up 25% from $18 million in 1991 and triple the $7.5 million booked in 1987. 0ne-third of revenues come from industrywide studies like the CSI . Power charges on a sliding scale : Small customers such as Alfa Romeo or Saab may pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up $100,000 . That money buys thick books of data , breaking down the results of the survey model by model across the entire industry . Winners also get the right  --  for an added fee  --  to advertise the results . Another third of Power 's revenues come from single-client research , the results of which are secret . Typical recent topics have included salesperson and dealership performance . Power also forecasts auto sales and production by make , model , and plant , as well as manufacturers ' plans for new models . All the research supports a growing management consulting business . In addition , Power does extensive training for manufacturers and dealers in , for instance , the fine points of satisfying customers . Fast growth is changing the character of the 200-person firm , which has its headquarters on a single cramped floor in a nondescript , low-rise office building in suburban Los Angeles . Power , who filled job openings with friends and friends of friends until five years ago , recruited MBAs on campus for the first time this spring . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional consultants have joined the firm , one from Booz Allen &; Hamilton , the other from McKinsey &; Co . Power is even creating a new strategic plan to chart the firm 's course through 1995 . Scarcely a week goes by without someone showing up with a checkbook to see if the company is for sale . It is n't , but Power says he might consider an offer if it were lavish enough . What the business is worth is n't clear , but Power values the databases his surveys have created at up to $30 million . The books are kept conservatively . Rather than syndicate his industrywide studies by getting the participants to pay for them up front , Power bears all the costs himself . Research expenses are not capitalized but accounted for within two years , though the survey methodology and framework have lasting value and even the old data can be reused to show historical trends . Profits are reinvested in the business . That keeps reported margins low , around 5% , and minimizes taxes . Says an investment banker who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : " This is a brilliantly conceived company with a very interesting niche . What they do is high quality and should yield 20% pretax . The potential is vast . But they need to manage two transitions : to get their arms even further around the auto business in ways they have n't done before , and to move on to customer satisfaction in a variety of industries , not just one . Though he is delegating more management tasks these days , Power , 60 , remains his own best salesman and consultant . Known to friends as Dave , he 's unpretentious and low key . Some see a striking resemblance to the late actor Peter Sellers . Power travels 80% of the time , visiting Detroit once a month , Japan every two months , and Europe three times a year . A recent stretch of nine days in the office left him with a mild case of cabin fever and a desire to hit the road again . Power , a Wharton MBA , worked for Ford as a financial analyst and then as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started his company in 1968 to do market research . Toyota was his first client , but he quickly branched out ; today no single company accounts for more than 5% of his business . In conversation , Power sounds more like a reformer or a philosopher than a businessman . Says he : " The big kick I get is making an impact and changing the way that people see things . It 's a process , not a goal , and the horizon keeps growing . " Because Power is the most respected and best-known arbiter of consumer-related automotive issues , his studies are occasionally sources of controversy . Some arise from misunderstanding : The CSI and Sales Satisfaction Index are primarily measures of dealer performance ; the other three major ones rank vehicle quality . A typical Power study includes 40 makes of cars , but Power publishes only the rankings of the brands that score above average . Those that finish below average he lists alphabetically in the results that are released to the public . Since Power sells his results to literally every manufacturer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power takes pains to mediate them . In the mid-1980s , he opened his studies to three statisticians from graduate business schools for an independent vetting . " That stopped the complaints about our methodology , " says senior partner J. Ferron . In the late 1980s , Ford complained about the sample size and the response rates of Power 's Initial Quality Study , which , unlike the automaker 's own research , ranked Ford beneath its domestic competitors . That proved embarrassing , because Ford advertised itself as America 's highest-quality car manufacturer . Ford and Power discussed their separate methods of data collection and interpretation , and both say the dispute has largely been resolved . Ford 's quality rating has kept improving , and it now outranks General Motors and Chrysler in the Initial Quality Study . Placing first in a Power ranking is n't merely good for the ego . As Buick discovered , you can take it to the bank . On May 5 , 1989 , Power announced that the Buick LeSabre had leapt from 44th to second place in the Initial Quality Study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. car with the fewest reported problems . Buick immediately began advertising that fact , and LeSabre sales took off with a whoosh . After increasing 5.7% in April over the previous year and 9.3% in May , they exploded , rising 32% in June , 91% in July , and 99% in August . Buick 's example brought a crush of automakers to Power 's door eager to use a Power ranking in their advertising . Power charges clients a $ 10,000 license fee to do that . In addition , they pay up to $2,500 for approval of each new piece of advertising copy and up to $3,750 for each TV commercial script . Wide use of the Power imprimatur , however , quickly threatened to diminish its value . Chevrolet , for instance , advertised its Lumina as the Power-certified most-trouble-free two-door car in the midsize segment . That was faint praise indeed , since every car answering that description , including the Lumina , had more problems than the average for all automobiles . The Lumina episode crystallized a growing belief inside and outside the company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Toyota 's Borst : " We were the first ones to really use Power rankings in our advertising , beginning in 1987 , but after a couple of years it got to be very confusing . Other manufacturers ' cars were being advertised that were quite far down the quality list . " The year after the Lumina episode , Power put his foot down . As of 1991 , the Power name may normally he associated only with the top make in four categories : best American , Asian , and European brands , and best overall . Lexus now occupies first place in three of the studies , which cuts down the opportunities for endorsements anyway . Power conducts his surveys by mail with lists of registered owners that he buys from a Detroit vendor , R.L. Polk . A typical questionnaire to 70,000 car owners consists of six to eight pages , contains up to 90 questions , and takes 30 to 40 minutes to complete . A dollar bill is often enclosed as an incentive . Power needs about 150 completed questionnaires per model to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high for surveys of this kind : It averages 38% and sometimes hits 50% . Power attributes those results to his name recognition and the seriousness Americans bring to buying a car . Least likely to reply are the owners of luxury and sports cars . Presumably the former ca n't be bothered and the latter are having too much fun . When the questionnaires come back , a team of 100 to 150 part-time workers processes them . Power uses a two-step procedure to develop the results . The first , called factor analysis , identifies the issues consumers are most concerned about . In the three-year Vehicle Performance Index , for example , they are reliable operation , interior comfort and appearance , interior space , and clear instruments and handy controls . Regression analysis determines how much weight each gets . In the case of the VPI , reliability led with 54% . Just as College Board exams gave birth to cram schools , Power studies have sired consultants who specialize in helping dealers raise CSI scores . Manufacturers and dealers sometimes use devious methods to improve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks before the CSI study went out in an apparent attempt to influence the responses ; Power says the effect was negligible . Occasional evidence of outright fraud turns up . Individual dealers have tried to stuff the Power ballot box by copying questionnaires and mailing in extra ones . Power catches the cheaters with an electronic scanner and by cross-checking names of responders against a mailing list . With Power 's success , more competitors are trying to slice off chunks of his business . Among the most aggressive is AutoPacific Group , in Santa Ana , California , founded by former Power analyst George Peterson . Last year Peterson hired Power 's well-known forecaster Chris Cedergren and another Power associate to work out estimates of new-vehicle sales and production volume . Power subsequently sued AutoPacific and the two former employees for stealing trade secrets , saying they had taken 14,000 pages and 49 computer disks of confidential information . Peterson says the material was n't used in creating AutoPacific 's own reports and has all been returned to Power . Attempts to settle the suit have failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consumer auto research seemingly approaching saturation , Power is looking for growth in other areas . Besides strengthening his consulting business , he wants to extend industrywide customer satisfaction reports to such products and services as airlines , heavy-duty trucks , recreational vehicles , and office machines . A CSI for personal computers and related products launched last year is being repeated and expanded . Power has yet to confront the two most important decisions a company founder must make : providing for transitions in the firm 's ownership and in its leadership . There are ten partners , two of them newly anointed " senior partners , " though Power remains the majority shareholder . Power 's son , J.D. " Jamey " Power IV , 29 , joined the family firm nearly two years ago after stints at Chevrolet and an advertising agency for Mazda . Poised and articulate , he works a few doors away from his father as marketing manager of automotive research . Power himself retains enormous zest for his job . Ever the reformer , he has lately applied his survey research talent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSA . After polling 4,650 people , more than enough for a valid national survey , he found , among other things , that Americans are most satisfied with the service they get from supermarkets , emergency rooms , and their telephone companies . In the bottom ten : government , public transportation , car and health insurance , and , yes , car dealers . So far Power has n't marketed the CSA , but he is already making plans for similar studies in Europe ( CSE ) and Japan ( CSJ ) . Perhaps someday government officials on three continents may have to answer to constituents about their Power ranking  --  just as automakers do now . <p>
