<p> When Julie Miller began trying to have a baby through in vitro fertilization , she had a plan . She would give it a year - four tries . Then , if that did not result in a successful pregnancy , she and her husband , Jesse , would seek to adopt a child . <p> " " I needed to have something in the wings if IVF did n't work , " Julie Miller recalled . <p> The couple , who live in Brooklyn , knew they wanted to have a child one way or another , so they approached an adoption lawyer even before Julie Miller began the last in vitro cycle . <p> As a psychotherapist , she recommends that others who are going through treatments for infertility start out with a plan for the treatment and its aftermath . <p> There are no hard and fast rules as to when a couple should abandon efforts to have a biological child . The chances of success depend on many factors , including the cause of the infertility ( which can not always be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clinic and the development of new techniques , like the recently discovered ability to extract a single viable sperm from a " " sterile " man and use it to fertilize an egg . <p> However , Miller , who practices in Manhattan , maintains : " " You ca n't just go along month after month , year after year , hoping you 'll get pregnant . You need to know when enough is enough . <p> You should have a clear idea at the start of how much time , money and emotional energy you are willing to invest in trying to get pregnant . <p> " " It 's too easy to become obsessed with getting pregnant . IVF is such an emotional roller coaster . You can get addicted to the high you experience when starting a new cycle . It 's such a letdown when you fail to get pregnant that you ca n't wait to start another cycle and re-experience the high , the hope , that this time it will work . " <p> Miller did not pick four cycles out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fertility clinic had told them that their chances of a successful pregnancy would not improve after four in vitro efforts . <p> Many doctors tell patients that their prospects of conceiving decline after each in vitro effort , although the Millers know a couple who had twins on their fifth try . <p> But more important than the dwindling prospects of a pregnancy or the soaring costs of treatment in deciding how far to go with in vitro fertilization was Julie Miller 's state of mind . <p> Between the mood-altering effects of hormone treatments and the ups and downs of expectations and disappointments , there was just so much of the experience she could take and still function effectively . <p> " " I had to stop working during the last cycle , " she recalled . <p> " " I would see two patients and then I would start to cry . After nine months on a roller coaster of hope and despair , I was emotionally worn out . <p> " " It 's like repeatedly going through a whole cycle of birth and death without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , society understands and pours out an appropriate amount of sympathy and support . But losing a pregnancy , really a chemical pregnancy , can be just as devastating . You go through the same kind of grief and mourning . You get some sympathy , but people really do n't have a clue to what it 's like unless they 've been through it themselves . " <p> A year after their last failed IVF effort , the Millers adopted a baby , but even that process was marred by a cycle of hope and despair . Their first try at adoption fell through . The teen-age mother of the baby they were supposed to get changed her mind at the last minute , after the Millers had flown to Texas to bring the infant home . Julie Miller described the next three months as " " the worst period of my life . " <p> The agony is now gone , though not forgotten ; the Millers delight in their daughter , Molly , 6 , now a first-grader . <p> Pamela Madsen , president of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people deal with infertility problems , said each woman had to " " decide how much you can take , how much your marriage can take . " Adoption is one option when IVF fails , but adoption , she pointed out , " " is not a cure for infertility , it 's a cure for parenting . " Madsen said " " some couples adopt a child and continue on with infertility treatments ; others say , ' I 'm getting out of the ovarian Olympics , I do n't need to have a child , ' and they go on to have wonderful lives without children . " Amy Schaffer , a New York psy chotherapist who decided to abandon the idea of having a baby after four miscarriages in her 40s , said couples going through infertility treatments need support from people " " who do n't have a vested interest in the outcome . " The pressures can be unbearable - for example , from the couple 's parents who want to have a grandchild ; from friends who say " " enough already , forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . As Schaffer put it : " " It can feel very courageous , empowering , to keep on trying . It fends off feelings of helplessness and feeling like a victim . There can be a strong sense of failure associated with giving up . But at the same time , keeping on trying can become self-defeating . You have to recognize when this is no longer a viable way of feeling empowered . " <p> Participation in support groups , like those run by Resolve , can be helpful in enduring the emotional trials of infertility treatments and in coming to terms with alternatives to having a biological baby . <p> Support groups can also help people weather treatment failure . <p> As Julie Miller put it , " " In addition to feeling devastated about not having a baby , you 've spent all that money and have nothing to show for it . " <p> For those who can afford it , couples ' therapy can help to ward off problems that typically arise when a couple faces the stress of dealing with infertility . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so needy , so depressed , " Miller said . " " They may start attacking each other for not being emotionally available . " The Millers worked out a signal that Julie could use in public to let Jesse know when she needed a hug . <p> Madsen reminds couples : " " As crummy as you feel at the moment , it wo n't last forever . The bad feelings will resolve . " Julie Miller believes it also helps " " to have a positive image of what your life will be like three years from now if the treatments do n't work . " <p> " " If you 're not going to adopt , " she said " " it helps to visualize doing something in the future that is pleasurable and satisfying to you as an individual and as a couple .
