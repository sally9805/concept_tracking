Impressionist C. W. Mundy explains how to work from photographs as an alternative to painting en plein air . <p> Artists sometimes counter a subject at begs to be painted but , for a variety of reasons , they can not take advantage of the opportunity . Perhaps rime is short , carting equipment is inconvenient , or the subject presents itself unexpectedly . In cases like these , a viable alternative is to take photographs and use them for reference later . The challenge is to retain a plein air feel by making the same artistic choices as when painting from life , without letting the photo dictate the final outcome . <p> Charles Warren ( C.W. ) Mundy , a plein air impressionist whose pieces are found in corporate and private collections and in institutions ranging from the Indiana State Museum in Indianapolis to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield , Massachusetts , works from photographs when circumstances make it difficult to paint from life . In fact , he has created an entire series , The Mediterranean Tour 1998 Collection , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - x-  12 " oil-on-linen paintings of locales in Spain , Portugal , France , Italy , Greece , and Turkey , resulted from a six-week cruise on which Mundy served as a guest lecturer . " The logistics of this trip defined not only where I would paint but how I would paint , " he says , noting that he had only rive to six hours to visit each port of call . " I also had a problem with my left foot , " he adds , " and could n't carry equipment out in the field . " <p> During the cruise , Mundy spent his rime at each port taking black-and-white Polaroids and color 35mm prints of likely sites . Upon re-embarking , he had the photos developed at an onboard one-hour photo shop , after which he proceeded to the upper deck , where he selected the best examples and started to paint . He concentrated on each destination for two or three days , until the ship reached its next stop , when he started the process again with new photos . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental notes in your mind , " Mundy says . <p> As an illustrator for more than 20 years , Mundy gained experience working from slides and photographs . He stresses , however , that working from photos " should never become a steady diet " or take precedence over painting from life . He maintains that artists should have several years ' experience painting en plein air before tackling the technique of painting from photographs . THE SEVEN PEARLS OF PAINTING <p> " I try to paint from photography as a plein air painter would , " says Mundy . " I apply the same key procedures that I use in plein air painting to working from photos . " In his lectures , Mundy teaches that there are seven steps to creating a painting  --  squinting , design , drawing , value , color , edges , and paint manipulation  --  which he terms " the seven pearls of painting . " He advises following these procedures when working from photographs , just as one would when creating a work en plein air . <p> Squinting at a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures within shadowed areas , and simplify the design by eliminating the " fluff and duff , " in Mundy 's words . Whereas in life the eye and brain edit out less important details from a scene , photos make nonessential elements take on added importance . " There 's everything but the kitchen sink in there , Mundy says . This characteristic of photographs makes squinting as important a first step as it is when painting from life . <p> The design of the desired painting should be the artist 's priority when taking reference photographs . " It 's really paramount to design with the camera as you would when you 're painting from life . Taking the right photo is the same thing as going out in the field and finding the right subject to make a great painting , " says Mundy , noting that some artists have the tendency to just look for scenes through the camera , rather than seeking views that would make successful paintings . <p> He advises looking for a " centrality of focus "  --  the single thing the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " golden section " of the photograph , the inner rectangle that occurs at the four intersecting lines of an imaginary ticktacktoe board . " We 're painting fine art , not scenes , " Mundy continues . " I do n't just take a snapshot here and snapshot there . I look for something strong and powerful to start out with . " <p> Since photographs contain much more information than will go into the final painting , making a sketch or taking notes at the scene may be of use later in simplifying the design . " The information from the photo dictates putting way too much down , " Mundy says . As a result , artists are sometimes apt to copy all the data in the photograph rather than focusing on the central element . " That comes from their lack of experience in working from life , " Mundy contends . <p> The third pearl of painting , according to Mundy , is drawing . " A painting is only as good as your ability to draw , " he says . He stresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of painting , not the spirit of drawing . " This is especially true when working from photos , since they often lend themselves to copying rather than interpreting . <p> A photograph , particularly a black-and-white Polaroid shot , can facilitate the next step , which is determining the values to be included in a painting . The camera lens simplifies and emphasizes values , much as the eyelid does when squinting , helping to establish where the darkest darks and lightest lights are . " That 's the litmus for the middle tones , " says Mundy . Some of the paintings in The Mediterranean Tour 1998 Collection , including Malaga , Spain , and Lisbon , Portugal , are value studies , using only white , black , and sepia . <p> He reemphasizes the importance of taking authorship of the painting so it does not become a copy . " You may want to shift those values to help lock in that centrality of focus , " he says . <p> While working from photos makes it easier to identify values , the opposite is true when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo is never the same as it is in life , " cautions Mundy , noting that the type of camera , brand and speed of film , type of paper , and other variables affect photographic color . Photos can help an artist recall colors and see color relationships , but should not be taken as an accurate guide . Color decisions , including choosing the " mother color " should support the central theme and avoid confusion or complexity . <p> The last two of Mundy 's pearls of painting , edges and paint manipulation , are similar whether painting from life or from a photograph . " You need to take the responsibility to have the edges work for you , " says Mundy , noting that squinting at a photograph , as in life , will help identify edges . The main edge should be within the golden section , with other edges supporting the central focus rather than being too strong and therefore distracting . <p> The last step , paint manipulation , requires the use of a variety of brushstrokes , particularly within large masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundy , pointing out that this is true not only of paint manipulation but also of the previous steps . COMBINING PHOTOGRAPHS <p> One advantage of working from photographs is the ability to combine elements from more than one shot into a single painting . One of the pieces in The Mediterranean Tour 1998 Collection , Grand Bazaar , Istanbul , is an example of the effective use of this technique , which Mundy honed in his years as an illustrator creating montages of athletes for halls of fame and other sports-related clients . <p> " The photos I had of the Grand Bazaar just did not have the simplicity and centrality of focus I wanted , " says Mundy . One of his photographs showed two Turkish women in the foreground , wearing brightly colored scarves that could serve as a painting 's focus , but the background was not to Mundy 's liking . Another picture contained supporting and background information , but no central idea . By combining the two shots , Mundy was able to create a successful painting . <p> " It 's easier to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundy . " You can piece it together as long as it looks believable . " In this case , he cut the women out of one of the photos and pasted them into the appropriate spot in the other . He cautions , however , that the two pictures must have the same scale . In addition , " they have to be photos taken at the same time with the same light source . Otherwise it will look like surrealism . " <p> Mundy believes the greatest trap artists fall into when working from photos is to get caught up in copying what they see in the shot , taking a literal , rather than interpretive , approach . " People tend to let the photo be too dictatorial , " he says . <p> " No one 's going to see the subject matter " he concludes . " It 's the authorship that they 'll respond to . I 'd like the painting to tell the audience more about me than the subject .
