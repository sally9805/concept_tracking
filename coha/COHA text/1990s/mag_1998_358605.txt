Guitarist Jimmy Page , 54 , and vocalist Robert Plant , 49 , both former members of the ' 70s megagroup Led Zeppelin , seem to amuse each other constantly . It 's nothing verbal , nothing too overt  --  nonetheless , when you meet them , there always seems to be a smile playing about their lips as if they were both in on a secret joke . The pair 's new CD , Walking into Clarksdale  --  their first full album of newly written collaborative material since Led Zeppelin first broke up in 1980  --  has a similar vibe . When you hear Plant 's aching vocals paired once again with Page 's tough , tight guitar work , you can sense an understanding , a secret , shared discourse . <P> Indeed , according to Page , many of the songs on Walking into Clarksdale were recorded in " one or two " takes . The pair were going for spontaneity , and the effort paid off . Despite the weight of their history  --  bands like Pearl Jam have borrowed from them , movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking into Clarksdale is a relatively loose-limbed , unencumbered affair . There are no sprawling Stairway to Heaven-type pieces here , only songs that are for the most part relatively modest and direct . This is n't hard rock , but it is solid . <P> Shining in the Light , the album 's first song , is one of the best offerings . It 's a mellow , midtempo rocker flavored with restrained yet forceful guitar work from Page . Their rambling , agreeable Blue Train is another strong track ; it 's a wise , mature song that builds carefully to its climax without the excesses that have sometimes plagued their work . Led Zeppelin was often about power and showmanship ; Page and Plant , in this album , rely on emotional depth and craftsmanship . <P> The album fumbles when it overreaches . Most High , a rocker that 's meant to evoke the sounds of the Middle East , lacks a focus . And the album 's finale , the raving Sons of Freedom , is a discordant , fuzzed-out mess . The disc was recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nirvana 's album In Utero  --  and his personal love for noise rock comes through too strongly here . Page and Plant are better off when they follow their own , time-tested instincts . <P> The pair say they 're happier as a duo than as part of a megagroup ( neither of them talks to Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones very much , and drummer John Bonham died in 1980 ) . " This is what we like , " says Plant . " It does n't attract the same attention . It suits my years and my ambition . " Plant also says that although " the best place to find us is in a bar , " they do n't party as hard on tour as they once did . " We control it now , " says Plant . " Before , it was rather amorphous  --  we could n't stop it . " Walking into Clarksdale is the sound of two men whose hearts still run wild but who also understand , most of the time , when to stop and stroll . <P>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
