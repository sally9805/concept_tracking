Section : Technology Medicine Endometriosis , little known and underdiagnosed , causes unremitting pain and infertility in millions of women . So why are n't drugmakers and the government doing much about it ? <p> AT AGE 21 JULIE P. ROMANO could n't imagine that anything would go terribly wrong in her life . She was starting her first full-time job and planned to marry one day and have lots of kids . " I always wanted eight boys , " she says . <p> Then one day she blacked out at work and was rushed to the hospital with a fever and stabbing pelvic pain . It took a month before she got a diagnosis : endometriosis , a " woman 's disease " she had never heard of . Bits of tissue normally found in the uterus lining ( the endometrium ) had grown where they should n't : on her left ovary , on a bladder wall and elsewhere . A doctor removed the bits and said she 'd be fine . <p> She was n't . Now 36 and living in Livingston , N.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could n't . She spent her twenties enduring surgery after surgery  --  a dozen in all  --  to root out the disease . At age 28 she had a hysterectomy and went into menopause . " It was devastating . " <p> Endometriosis is a scourge of modern women , underdiagnosed , poorly treated and incurable . It afflicts 7 million  --  almost twice the number of Alzheimer 's patients and seven times those with Parkinson 's . It is believed to be a leading cause of female infertility ( another is fallopian tube dysfunction ) , present in up to half of the 5 million women in the U.S. who have trouble conceiving . Each year 120,000 women have hysterectomies because of it . <p> A lucrative market awaits drug companies , yet endometriosis is all but ignored by the medical establishment . Virtually no federal money has gone into researching the disease , and drugmakers have made little effort to study it or find new treatments for it . <p> Even giants that do a thriving trade in drugs for women are idle on this front . Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't doing any research . Searle , Hoechst and Solvay Pharmaceuticals all are in human trials of estrogen-replacement drugs for menopausal women , but none is working on endometriosis . <p> " Where are the drug companies ? Why are n't they putting any money into this ? " says Romano , who is still on disability because of her disease . Answer : Tackling such a tough pathology is far more difficult and more costly than aiming at me-too drugs in a well-established field . And as baby boomers move past 50 , aging women will make up a richer market than females in their 20s and 30s who ca n't get pregnant . <p> " Millions of women are suffering , and no one is listening . What 's wrong with this picture ? " says Dr. David Redwine of Bend , Ore. , who operates on 150 endometriosis patients every year . <p> The U.S. government has done little to narrow the gap . The National Institutes of Health plans to spend $16.5 billion on research in fiscal 2000 and has set aside $2.7 million for researching endometriosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disease gets $102 a head ; the figure is $31 for Lupus , an autoimmune disease affecting 1.4 million people , most of them women . <p> Some say progress could be made if drugmakers would devote more effort to the search . Scientists are pursuing insights about the molecular mechanisms of endometriosis ; one day that could lead to new drug therapies . In corporate labs two new compounds are in the works , the first potential new therapies in a decade . <p> The main theory of what causes the disease was first put forth in 1921 and has been updated little since then . Bits of the uterine lining , instead of flushing out of the body during menstruation , move backwards through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity . A later notion holds that nearly all women get this " retrograde menstruation , " but the body usually knows how to get rid of it . In some women , though , a cluster of factors  --  flaws in the immune and endocrine systems , possibly genetic glitches  --  results in endometriosis . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs and in the cul-de-sac , a cavity behind the uterus . In some cases lesions spread to the bowel and small intestine ; in severe cases it can infiltrate the lungs , liver and even the eyeballs . The pain comes from the lesions themselves , which swell and bleed and form thick scar tissue . In the worst cases the scarring binds organs together , requiring invasive surgery . <p> Hard data are n't available , but the severity of cases may have risen in recent decades as women joined the work force and delayed having babies . " It 's a disease of menstruation , " says Dr. David Olive , a Yale professor of obstetrics and gynecology . Modern-day women have 450 menstrual cycles in their lifetimes , compared with 100 or so in past centuries , when women had babies every year and breast-fed longer , idling menstruation . <p> The first symptoms can be heavy bleeding and pain so intense that some women miss a day or two of work every month . When the pain drives them to a doctor , gynecologists often tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychotherapy . <p> " I told one doctor who gave me the number of a ' good therapist ' that if he wanted to know what endo feels like , to put his testicles in a vice and keep turning , " says Krystal Tilley , a 30-year-old Chattanooga , Tenn. resident who has had endometriosis since she was 16 . " He crossed his legs . " <p> A recent survey of 4,000 women with the disease found that two-thirds started having symptoms before age 20 . Most waited five years to seek treatment , and doctors took five years to make the right diagnosis , says Mary Lou Ballweg , president of the Endometriosis Association in Milwaukee , with 25,000 members worldwide . <p> If only there were an easy way to test for it . Even experienced doctors can have trouble finding it . The lesions can be too small to feel in a pelvic exam , and a patient 's symptoms do n't always correspond to severity . Women writhing in pain may have a mild case ; others seem fine but are infertile . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laparoscopy , an outpatient surgery . Even then it is n't easy to spot . The lesions can be microscopic or can spring up underneath tissue , where they cause pain but are invisible . <p> Current treatment is a series of bleak choices , and most interfere with a key goal of many endo patients : getting pregnant . Doctors prescribe oral contraceptives first , to put a brake on the menstrual cycle and ease pain . If that does n't work , they push drugs called gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonists . But that halts the menstrual cycle . <p> TAP Pharmaceuticals is the only maker actively marketing such a drug . Its entry , Lupron , has $150 million in annual sales to women ( it has a bigger market among men with prostate cancer ) . TAP , with $2 billion in sales and a Lupron sales force of only 200 , says the drug could have sales four times as high if more doctors and women knew about the disease . " The challenge here is awareness . It 's holding back diagnosis and treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marketing . <p> A better product might bring far higher revenue . Lupron does n't work well in some women . While it and other GnRH drugs can quell pain for months , sometimes for years , they force young women into artificial menopause , with such symptoms as hot flashes and loss of bone density . That is because these chemicals suppress the release of estrogen , which otherwise feeds the growth of endometrial lesions . These symptoms ease if doctors add back doses of estrogen , but that risks reigniting the disease . <p> Surgery often is the best step , but quality levels vary widely . " I have patients who have had 15 surgeries , " says Dr. Redwine of Oregon . " The one thing they have n't had done is have the endometriosis taken out of their bodies . " <p> Insurers play a role here , too . They wo n't pay the $10,000 or more for the best surgeons if they are n't part of the health plan 's network . Dr. J. Victor Reyniak , a surgeon and reproductive specialist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first sent her to a gynecologist , who removed one of her ovaries . When her pain persisted , she hoped to have Reyniak treat her , but her health plan insisted she go back to the in-plan doctor . " She 's probably castrated by now , " he says . <p> Even hysterectomy with removal of both ovaries , seen as a cure in medical literature , is n't one , doctors say . The endo lesions can remain outside the organs that were removed . After Romano had her hysterectomy , the pain worsened . Scar tissue wrapped itself around her bowel , sticking to her abdominal wall and shooting pain down her right leg . " For two years I walked with a cane . " <p> So many horror stories . Some drugmakers are trying to develop GnRH rivals to Lupron . Amgen and Cambridge , Mass. - based Praecis Pharmaceuticals are in early human trials with a GnRH antagonist that blocks estrogen production without first ramping it up , an acceleration that can intensify endo pain for weeks . Malcolm Gefter , Praecis ' chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full estrogen block , suggesting reduced bone loss . <p> Lupron 's maker , TAP , is in late-stage animal testing of another kind of compound , a selective progesterone receptor modulator . It might be able to shut off hormones affecting endometrial tissue only . John Seely , TAP 's research vice president , says the data are " unbelievably encouraging . " Human trials could begin next year . <p> At American HomeProducts ' Wyeth-Ayerst unit , a handful of researchers search for genes that might turn on or shut off the molecular workings of the disease . In two years they have pinpointed 40 different genes that are dramatically different in lesions from those in normal endometrium . " We want to target the tissue itself . We want a permanent fix , " says C. Richard Lyttle , a Wyeth vice president . <p> In academic labs scientists are looking for underlying chemical causes inside the body . At Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Dr. Kevin Osteen has run animal tests linking the growth of endometrial lesions to an overabundance of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases ; blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nude " mice bred to accept alien tissue , blocking MMP action prevented the growth of human endo tissue when it was injected into the animals . Dr.Osteen wants to learn exactly how and why MMPs are produced in such abundance in the endometrium . <p> Dr. Robert Taylor of the University of California , San Francisco is studying two phenomena : the inflammation that occurs at the site of endometrial lesions and the way blood vessels spring up to nourish the lesions . <p> Someday new drugs might work in two ways , Dr. Taylor hypothesizes : They might prevent the inflammation response , and they could derail the formation of blood vessels that feed the lesions ; that would starve the invasive tissue of a blood supply . " It 's clearly a complex puzzle , but if we can find one thing that 's wrong , we can fix it . " <p> At the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , Dr. Bruce Lessey has discovered that in mild cases women do n't have enough working beta-3 integrins , cell adhesion receptors essential to egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hormone-based drugs . He argues the lack of beta-3 may be a marker that could tag which women can benefit from the drugs and avoid costly attempts at in vitro fertilization . ( Adeza Biomedical of Sunnyvale , Calif. sells a $425 lab test for beta-3 , but it is n't widely used . ) <p> Such efforts will take many years to gel . Millions of women are waiting . In some ways , it is too late for Julie Romano of New Jersey : She is thinking of adopting . For thousands like her , that is the only option they have left . An Inside Look <p> Endometriosis is a leading cause of infertility in women . The disease occurs when the uterine lining grows where it should n't  --  on the ovaries , in the abdomen , even on the bladder and bowel . It leads to 120,000 hysterectomies a year . So Many Women  --  and So Few Dollars <p> Where do federal research dollars go ? Not to endometriosis .
