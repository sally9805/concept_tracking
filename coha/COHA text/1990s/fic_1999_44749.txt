Rob Chilson lives in Kansas City , Missouri . If is most recent novel is Black as Blood and he notes that his story " Acute Triangle was recently adapted for the Worlds of Paradox series on cable television . This new sf story is set in the same wellconceived future as his May 1992 cover story " Far-Off Things , " but you do n't need to reread that tale to enjoy this speculation about what world gene-splicing might bring in the far future . <p> How long , how long , in infinite pursuit Of This and That endeavour and dispute ? Better be merry with the fruitful grape Than sadden after none , or bitter , fruit . - Omar/Fitzgerald ENTING soNELLIAN SAT crosslegged before his croft , playing the zootibar . The haunting minor-key notes of the long bamboo flute wafted down to the beach and out over the Bay of Repose . To his right , Weary Water slipped soundlessly into the Bay . To his left , beyond the Bay to the west , the Ramping Sea lay sleeping . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing " Joy to the Morning " in massed chorus . The air was as warm as milk and as invigorating as wine . And best of all , Calian dautNinnian , Wenty 's current lover and future wife , was sleeping in his croft . All was well on this best of all mornings in the sixty million years since man-kin first appeared upon the Prime Mondeign . The only discordant note in all the world was the bickering of the gulls on the beach . But Wenty was too happy to frown at that . Then Calian dropped her scarf by him and trotted into the bay , startling the gulls , who cursed her . Splashing herself in a quick bath , she rinsed off the salt in Weary Water , tossed back her cascade of golden hair , and padded back . She seated herself before him . Her slanted black eyes with their vertically slit pupils were common here in the Hitherland but no less beautiful for that . Wenty flung aside the zootibar and spread his arms , his gleaming red crest rising . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have had time to consider my proposal , eh ? " Confidently he employed the Executant of inquiry that made a complete sentence of his Utterance . " So , you will be my wife and live forever with me at Squatham and fill my life with joy , eh ? " " No , heh . " Smiling , she employed the Executant of response to inquiry . " No , eh ? No , eh ? " Wenty 's crest drooped . " You would turn down all this , eh ? " waving his arms about to encompass the croft , the orchard behind , Weary Water and the beach , the milk-warm and wine-invigorating air and - and everything . " Not you , huh , " he said , turning his head to frown at the gulls raucously including themselves in that " everything . " " Think , Caly : you 'd forfeit all these pleasures - and in addition the life-long pleasure of my conversation . Having enjoyed it life-long myself , I can tell you that it 's a life-long pleasure indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , eh ? " Laughing , Calian said , " A great pleasure indeed . But I wish to see more of the Prime Mondeign before I settle down , huh , " using the seldomemployed declarative Executant to indicate her seriousness . " I 've told you before , but you do not believe I mean it . I 've never been farther than Kirkilgowock , and you can see that from Skitty . " " This urge to travel - for why , eh ? Even if you travel from now on , think how much there 'll still be that you have n't seen . Life is too short , ha ! And in the meantime you are missing precious days in my company . " She said , " Oh , Wenty , do n't try to dissuade me . And I 'll be missing none of your tongue , for you shall take me about . I want to see cities and mountains and statues and islands , and - and - " " A city 's what but a fat village , or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've seen Kirkilgowock , and you 've been on a picnic to Ealeigh and Wesleigh , " he said , indicating the low grassy islands of the Sea Gate that protected the Bay of Repose from the Ramping Sea . " Two bits of meadow in the sea , that 's all . " She stood suddenly and passion entered her tones . " I 've never even been to Iorkonon , ha ! And Iorkonon - it 's what , eh ? Nothing but another modern seacoast trading center , heh ! I 've never seen a ruin of The Heights - not even a crumbling wall of High Material . I 've never even seen an exozootic animal , whose ancestors came from the stars . " She flung her arms wide . " I want to see the Prime Mondeign , ha ! Or at least a little bit of it . A cruise to the Farther Islands , perhaps . " Wenting had risen , and his crest rose too . " But what 's left to see , when you 've seen Squatham , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Heston Hills , and nearest of them Dun Bromgaw and Dun Ullock rearing , dark and portentous , ha ! Not mountains , no ; not even grand hills ; but impressive for all that . And see , over them and spilling down from them , the dark , dangerous , and abysmal forest - the Hestwood , ha ! " Caly smiled tolerantly , tilting her head . " I 've been in the woods . I only saw trees . I 've even been in the Hestwood , on a picnic . We saw no dangers . No , no more arguments , ho ! " Caly used the commanding Executant sharply . A flock of gorcrows passing overhead were startled into imitation : kha ! kha ! kha ! " Shut your beaks , ho ! " she yelled up at them , tossing her hair , and turned back to Wenty . She tapped his chest . " Tonight , I sleep with Greling , whom I love also . And he has promised me , before we 're wed , to take me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he saves enough . Even aerial ships sail to Iorkonon , ha ! " Aghast , Wenty said , " You 'd sell yourself to your second-best lover for a mere pleasure trip , ha ! But if you do not marry me , then who will damn my socks , eh ? " " Damn your socks , eh ? " she cried , with a little shriek of laughter . " Dam all euphemisms , ha ! " he cried . Still smiling and shaking her head , Calian picked up her scarf and knotted it carefully around her waist , leaving the trademark on her hip exposed : the image of an eo-oak leaf in black melanin under her skin . Wenty 's was on his chest . " No more arguments , Wenting , huh . If you really love me , you 'll make an effort . Overcome your Hitherlands sloth , earn some money , and show me about a bit , ho . " With a last kiss and wave , she set off across the low ridge that concealed Skitty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly . The voices of the gulls were harsher than ever , the air now flat and dull , and behind Squatham , the birds had broken up their devotional and were all squawking derisively at him . " Chance damn it , " Wenty said . " She has been talking this way for a long time , and now - What nonsense , ha ! To go haring about like migrating birds but without their purpose , merely to gratify a whim for movement . Better to stay in some salubrious spot - Squatham comes to mind - and if one simply must move , then dance . " He sighed . " But how rare is the rational mind , ha ! How sadly rare . At times I fancy myself quite alone . " He turned about and checked ; his cat was digging a hole amid his flowers . " Chance damn you , Socks , ha ! " he cried . " There 's a muckreed pond down by Weary Water . " " Too far , huh , " grumbled Socks , squatting over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew further curses would be futile . Stamping into his croft , he slammed the door behind him and stood uneasily looking about . Squatham was snugly built , if small ; one room . He had glued together squared stones from some old building , brightened inside by yellow and white paint . The roof timbers were driftwood topped with hornstone shingles . There was a cooking , and in winter , heating stove in one wall , its firebrick gleaming dully . Also some shelves and wardrobes ; a table , three stools , a bundle of bedding on a fold-down shelf . A few clothes , books and sheet music , Calian 's spare tambangs , and the zootibar and titibuck Wenty played in their ensemble . Now he looked at Squatham as Calian might . Dull , he thought . " Where I see concentration on the task in hand namely , enjoyment of life - she must see boredom . Most of all , we both see one thing : the same thing every day forever , amen , ha ! But I can barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shaking his head , he went back out , closed the door gently , and looked around . Squatham , seen from Caly 's perspective , was even duller outside . The stones were their natural weathered dun color . Flowers grew about it and vines up on it . Back of it , beautiful and useful too , was his orchard . " Socks , if she had not been hinting for so long about having not one , but two childen , both by the same father , I wonder if my love for her Socks , eh ? Yo , Socks ! Off without a word , ha ! Ignored and dishonored in my own house , ha . But it was ever thus with the great of soul , huh . " Disconsolately he wandered toward the orchard at the back of his fist of land . Socks put her head out from beneath a flowering bush and watched him go , her tongue protruding pinkly . Of her no doubt disdainful thoughts , she spoke no word . Wenty had set out his now-thriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dairy trees yielding milk , cream , and cheese ; eggs came from bushes under them . Sandwiches from the handmeal trees provided quick meals " - the singleton 's salvation , " he reflected . " Also the breadfruit . " The cereal nut bushes provided storable food-he had all three varieties , a total of twenty-two different kinds of nuts . There were numerous fruit trees , with thick-rinded apples , oranges , purples , and yellows , among others . Spud bushes provided all colors of starchy tubers , also in thick rinds , and densely packed leafy heads . " So many salads on the stem . " Of fruits that did n't store , he had a number of trees . One yielded red , blue , and white grapes . " And bunches of cherries , " he added . " Soon it will be time to start the summer 's run of our cherry wine , famed from here to Skitty . " Another tree gave bunches of strawberries , blackberries , and so on . Four cloth trees marked his boundary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already grew on them , but they were too small to harvest the cheap bark cloth that he mainly wore . " If I had planted aluminum-seed trees three years ago on that strip of clay soil , I might have a cash crop now , " Wenty mused . " Or sea-silk seareeds on that bar just off Weary mouth . " Glumly he examined his three tansy trees . " On the other hand , " he said , brightening , " metal nuts delivered at Skitty have a negative valueworth nothing , less the cost of transport to Kirkilgowock . No , medicinals are the prime Chance , ha ! Light in weight , and high in value . " The tansies - the name was derived from athanatos - had leaves edged and veined with crimson , with crimson trademarks underneath indicating the nuts each bore . These ranged from simple headache pills , through anesthetics , to powerful symbiotics proof against most transmissible diseases . " Not much profit in headachers and soporifics , " he said . " Anesthetics and symbiotics alone , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also as less work , ha ! " An hour or two later , carrying his shabby knapsack , he followed Calian 's track over the ridge to Skitty . After a couple of miles he entered " bookland , " where the land was platted into legally registered , taxed , and inheritable plots . The village hummed with activity : a squatter from a southern fist led a placid Pontid pulling a wagon loaded with brew blooms and mushrooms . The squatter and his Pontid greeted him , and the latter waggled its comblike antlers . Men and women puttered in gardens . Children chased each other around the yard of the little school , unchanged since Wenting went . One man carried a crudely cast plastic jug of cooking fuel from the village 's muckreed marsh . Wenty paused at the yard of one of his elderly uncles . The uncle sat jawing with his wife about their disreputable roof . " When it 's a-rainin ' , you cai n't fix it , " Wenty said with a country twang , " and when it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's house . " His uncle agreed , laughing , and his wife said , " Long as it drips on your side of the bed , do n't care . " A small number of patrons sat under the tree in the innyard , where bulky old Peola sat in state and her patrons helped themselves to her wares , dropping small coins , " sparks , " into a bowl . Wenty greeted everyone by name , and stopped to speak to Ellian , his mother . It was half an hour past time for the ferry to depart when he reached the wharf . A small group of Skittles stood about , waiting for the ferryman . Slinging his knapsack behind his back , Wenty approached Greling , slapping the air with his palms , right-left , right-left . Greling 's golden crest rose and they slap-sparred for several seconds with blinding speed but without touching each other . A game of great skill and restraint , though no longer played with knives . " Thought you 'd lost your touch by now , playing the zootibar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught their breath . " I see Caly 's been talking to you , " nodding at Wenty 's knapsack . " Yes , heh , " said Wenty glumly . " Imagine my delight at being forced to labor like a landowner for the pleasure ha ha of absquatulating all over the Prime Mondeign . " Grely grinned . " Well , if you do acquire the necessary valuta , I 'll still have the longer Father . I like the idea of seeing a few things before platting out and starting a family . " " A family of two children , she told you , eh ? " " Yes , heh . When neither of us picked up her hints she upped her offer . I 'm taking carvings to Kirkilgowock - a manikin clock , and some windmills and toys and things . You , eh ? " " Medicinals , heh , " said Wenty , secretly thinking that even Grely 's best carvings would be an unsaleable drug on the market at Kirkilgowock . Fine hand work was common everywhere on the Prime Mondeign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothing or shelter . " Hmm , " said Grely . " Well - good luck , huh . " His dubiety was so obvious that Wenty had a qualm of doubt about his own choice . After all , medicines grew on trees . The ferryman appeared and began shepherding his patrons onto the barge . " Rowing , eh ? " he asked Wenty glumly . " Of course , heh , " Wenty said , paying half fare . They all did . Wenting and Greling got seats side by side and the bowman pushed off . Standing melancholy at the steering oar , the ferryman forlornly called the beat , and Wenty glanced over his shoulder to take the distance . Kirkilgowock 's silvery hornstone roofs shimmered two miles away across the Bay of Repose . " Mind you , it may be none too safe to travel , " Wenty said , heaving at the oar . " You think the Midlanders will make war on the Mudfeet , eh ? That would involve the Sons of Infamy . " The Hitherland was settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Sons of Infamy  --  their ancestors . The Wars had raged across the area for an octury , an octron of years . " Grely dropped his oar into the water . " The last time the Midlanders came against the Sons of Infamy , old delirious Delious lost his Swarthog regiment , his arm , and his baton . He said , quote , The Sons of Infamy are not peaceable ; they 're just lazy . " They rowed two strokes thoughtfully . " For a fact , we 're lazy enough , " Wenty admitted . " And peaceable . I doubt there 's a tetron of weapons in Skitty - and we live not so far from the Hestwood . " " Still , when the Farther Islands call for help against pirates , they call most on whom , eh ? " Grely said . " We 're dangerous enough still - just lazy , huh . " " Sons of Sloth rather than Infamy , ha . " " Ho , Gaffer , " Grely said to the old man behind Wenty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe all over the boat . Wenty will pull for you . " " Glad to , Gaffer Swanthold , " said Wenty , and put his back into it . The wheezing and gasping behind faded . " Thank " ee , lads , thank " ee . " " You 'll show us what , eh , at the next meeting of the Banana Literary Society , " Grely asked Wenty . " I 've been working on a six-line rispetto , a mere trifle , heh , " Wenty said . " The rhyme scheme is one-two , one-two implied , followed by a couplet , three-three stated . " Implied rhyme was discovered by a Cenozoic girl whose foot had gone to sleep . She cried a couplet in anapaestic monometer with implied rhyme : " There are stars In my shoe . " This seminal poem is flawed , in that it is not comprehensible without explication of the situation , and the rhymes , twinkling and tingling , are not perfect . But the technique was noted , and eventually bore fruit . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wenty delivered his lines between oar-strokes : " Born as urgent in the Sun as bright-faced flowers , " Striving as if work would bend inflexible Fate , " Yet we dimly see our ends in Future 's haze ; " All our effort speeds the grave and - blankness beyond . " Why then spend our only lives in fasting ? " Neither Love , nor Life , is everlasting . " Omitted Executants - " single-talk " - was much used by poets and philosophers , as it made the work ambiguous . Grely glanced over at him . " A hackneyed theme , but a good one . Let 's see , your rhymes-flowers imply blooming-and that rhymes with the third line 's " looming " through a haze . Hmm . " Fate " and " blankness beyond " - void - naught - rhymes with " lot " which means Fate . Blooming , lot , looming , naught , fasting , everlasting . Not bad , though far from great . " That was Wenty 's assessment . " And you 're working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanzas with double rhyme , stated and implied , heh . The implied scheme is three , three , four , three . I only have the first stanza finished . More or less finished , ha . " Taking a breath , he said to the rhythm of their strokes : " We come to Life with tongues like brooks a-babble ; " Knowing naught of Whence , much though we 've dinned , " Though of Why we 're here some will gibble-gabble : " But one in the end with the ignorant wind . " " Not bad , " Wenty said , trying to work out the implied rhymes . Lines one , two , and four rhymed , and brooks babbling had to be flowing . " A hackneyed theme also , but also a good one , and double rhyme is merely a trick . However - not bad at all . " " Oh , I 'm like you , never wanted to astound the world ; just to amuse my own easily amused self . " Wenty gave him a quick backhand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ! " Grely almost caught a crab , laughing . " I think your rhyme on the second line is too obscure , though , " Wenty said . He had n't got it . Sobering , Grely said , " That 's one of the reasons I have n't finished the second stanza . Double rhyme is tough . " Presently they pulled into the mouth of the Silking River and docked at Kirkilgowock . Wenty fetched a gourd of water from the public fountain for Gaffer Swanthold Wenty and Grely stood regarding Kirkilgowock . It was the largest , and only , city either had seen . A dodektron of man-kin congregated here two to the twelfth power , or 4,096 in the forgotten decimals of the Cenozoic . On market days , half again , or even twice as many , thronged the streets . Common folk such as themselves were found here ; water-breathing Marineers from the Mondalorn or " World-Waste " Ocean beyond the Farther Islands ; fur-bearing sylvandros with four legs ; and hulking ogres from the Tolland Plateau far up Silking River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe even Koshkonong on the Farther Islands , ha , " muttered Wenty . " ' Ouch , ha ! " cries the sufferer , " Grely said . He grinned and slapped Wenty 's shoulder . " Good luck , ha ! " He made off for the market squares . When Wenty had been to " all both " apothecaries and the fly market and counted his meager earnings , he disconsolantly sought the smaller market square . There he saw Grely 's gold-gleaming crest bending low . Despite himself , he felt a throb of relief , even pleasure , at his rival 's expression . Wryly he noted similar expressions on Grely 's face when the other descried him . " You need anesthetics , eh ? " Wenty asked him ironically . " Better , a big drink , heh . And you would like to buy a manikin clock that chimes the hours with fantastic capers , eh ? " " I mean to live my life in such a way as never to need a clock , let alone a noisy one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parted . A gloomy cloud threatened the Bay of Repose , but it only broke over Wenty when he saw Calian . So soon as she learned that he had done poorly at Kirkilgowock , she professed great interest in Greling 's fortune . " He 's such a good carver - he made our windmill , you know . " Wenty slap-sparred her cheeks , his palms fanning her hair gently ; she did n't blink or abate a jot of her dazzling smile . " You are a heartless , trifling , titivating tabby , " he told her severely . " And you may call that a farewell , ha . " Still she smiled , and followed him to the door . " Do n't forget , I come to you in three nights , " she called . " The night after you see Harlian . See that the sheets are clean , ho ! " Her mother Ninnian put her head out of the parlor window and called , " If you tire of her , Wenty dear , look me up , ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called back . " You at least are an honest tabby . " " Good night , Wenty , hurry for the storm . Love you , ha ! " Caly cried . " You can do what , when the woman loves you , eh ? " he asked himself , hurrying before the storm . " Naught , that 's what , heh . " NEXT MORNING he awoke to find Socks on his chest , peering enigmatically into his face . His breath came with effort ; she was as long as his arm from elbow to fingertip , not counting tail . " Give me food , ho , " she said immediately he opened his eyes . " Food , oh , " he said automatically , the Executant of response to command . Fog , the aftermath of the storm , darkened the windows . " A beautiful day , a salubrious day , a day for savoring , " he said , opening the door and peering out . He saw fog , and let some in , cold , wet , and raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socks . She leaped to her favorite shelf and shook her paw disdainfully . " Of all the animals on the Prime Mondeign , only cats dare give orders to man-kin , huh , " Wenty said . " But cats know no lord . " He bowed elaborately , too close to her , and received a box on the cheek that was no slap-spar . " Ouch , ha . There are times when you remind me of another woman , huh . " He set out food for her and hung up his bedding to air . Taking a battered aluminum saucepan , he made an omelette of eggs , cream , cheese , chopped vegetables , and the treemeat and peppery red pods of the jerkypod . He whistled and sang as he worked , aggravating Socks , already irritated by the weather . He made enough omelette for both of them , and shared with her . " Now , " he said when he was finished , tapping her to get her attention . " We have a problem - to make money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it across the room and crouched with her back to him . Picking up his tea-cup , Wenty followed her and squatted nearby . " Now , " he said , tapping her again . " This means of acquiring money , while preferably legal , must be other than , and faster than , the slow effect of honest toil . " Socks took the remainder of the omelette beneath the table , but Wenty stretched out on his elbow , head under it : " So , we must simply find the money or other valuta . " Socks flounced out from under the table , abandoning the last morsel , and sprang onto her shelf . Wenty stood and opened his mouth , but she hissed at him , ears back . " Be silent , ho ! " she cried . " Go away , ho ! " " Silent , eh ? You would have me burst , eh ? I can not be silent and live , ha ! " " You always talk , ha ! You always make noise , ha ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much noise , for why , eh ? For no reason , heh ! " Wenty stepped back against the table and struck an attitude with one hand held out . " O Cat , " he said , " damned Cat , who with specious sagacity speaking , mocks a man-kin 's chat , with haughty reprobations squeaking . " He approached the hand to her nose , waited while she spat at him and looked angrily away , then swooped on her , rolled her over , and dug his fingers into her large furry tummy . Instantly she whipped her paws onto his hand and dug in , bending her neck to bite as well , and a bloody tussle ensued . A watery golden beam of light struck through the window and they broke off . " A better day dawns at last , ha , " Wenty said . " Now you can go out without wetting your paws . You can go down to the muckreed marsh , huh . " She reluctantly released his hand . " Too far , huh . " Wenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds on his hand , gasping at the pain . " So it would seem , " he said over his shoulder , " that our best chance lies with the old tales of treasure to be found in the Hestwood - eh ? Gone , eh ? O faithless cat , ha ! But when did I ever need a cat , eh , or indeed any audience . " He donned winter pantaloons , long-sleeved shirt , and ankle boots , packed his knapsack with food and a waterproof , slung a short-handled shovel . There was a stubborn look to the haze in the northwest when he stepped out , suggesting they were n't done with weather yet . " To the southeast , past the orchard , lie the Heston Hills , covered with the dark-needled , ominous Hestwood . Alas , that great city . " A now-nameless city of the Heights of Mankind had rolled over the horizon there not less than a tetro-myrion of years ago . " For it was reckoned that the Fall from the Heights had occurred so long ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mighty in turn fallen . " After the Fall , a mighty city had arisen on the High city 's ruins , falling in its turn many generations ago . The name of that city was unknown , but it was now called Heston , because it was assumed to have been the capital of all the country round . Heston itself had since been mined out . " Now only the forest keeps its secrets . " Wenty stood hesitating . " So small a Chance , ha ! And yet , I have what other Chance , eh ? To draw the Long Father requires an ante , but to draw the Short Father , none . " Toss-sticks was played with three lengths of sticks . " I shall be back late , if indeed I make it back by tonight . Our ensemble meets tonight . Ah well , Harlian also plays zootibar . And she at least will miss me , if Calian does not . " Launching his canoe on Weary Water , he paddled with the tide , making good time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left . On his right was a milder , mostly deciduous forest , interspersed with meadows . Fistland , sparsely occupied by squatters . Civilization was returning gradually to the Hitherland , after the Octurian Wars . " But no one squats him in the Hestwood , " he added ominously . Nearest of the Heston Hills were Dun Bromgaw and Dun Ullock , from between which came the Hestwater . It too was tidewater , and the tide took him up to the very foot of Dun Bromgaw . He tied up and climbed the hill , staying alert for valuta . High Mondeign cities were rich in iron , copper , even lead , all of which were mined by the appropriate trees . " Also , and more important , " he added with enthusiasm , " High cities are sources of nonTabular elements , ha ! " These were elements not found in nature : scarlet coronium , purple imperex , noble copper , starsilver , among metals ; galatium , vionium , and so on , amongnonmetals . " Galatium in particular , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Galatia buds were extremely valuable as perfume sources . " Yet , what do I mostly see , eh ? Firks , heh , " sadly . He paused on the top and wiped his brow . The forest stood silently regarding him in the heat of the day . A rich gloom as of an ancient cathedral hung over him . The glow diffusing between needle and needle above filled all the forest with a faint green mist of light , struck back sharply from the bright green of the moss that covered the soil without a break . Drifts of last year 's dead needles made a brown candlewick pattern on the moss . Down the slopes marched the dark-stemmed ranks of trees , solemn , mysterious , haunted by thoughts no human could think . Wenty cleared his throat . " And no sign of valuta , huh . " The city of Heston , whatever its name , had mined these hills for octuries . He hesitated , then descended to the Hestwater again . This stream , running between the hills , had dug more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining the banks and bed of the stream . All he found amid the rounded stones were occasional odd bits of fractured glassy High material . Jewelers sometimes carved these things into imitation gems , but they were harder to work than real gems and less flashy . Other bits of High material were opaque ; dull white or gray . The bushes along the stream were ordinary . No galatias here . Nothing , nothing , nothing . " The trees of generations of miners have drained all valuta from this soil , huh , " he said glumly . The rest of the day he followed the Hestwater far into the Heston Hills . A dark shadow fell over him . Startled , he looked up . Night had fallen , but he had not noticed , for the overcast sky directly above him still glowed in a broad circle . " The long-gone streets of the High city still are lit , " he said in awe . He 'd seen this glow on the Hestwood from a distance , but had never stood in it , visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Mondeign a celestial lumer had turned its insubstantial , sun-catching mirror toward the site of the Hestwood . The lumers remained faithful to their last commands long after the cities they sought to illuminate were darkened by time beyond any power to brighten . " And now the lights of the Heights are occulted by the bitter clouds of these unhappy days , " he observed . A rank of black clouds was blowing between him and the glowing sky . Even as Wenty looked hurriedly around for a suitable camping place , darkness came down like the lid of a blackened pot . Except - " This is what , eh ? " he murmured . To the east and south , a faint glow of greenish light was visible . Wenty groped cautiously through the darkened forest . The glow grew , permeating a section of forest , as if a lighthouse beam from behind made every leaf glow greenly . No fyrhs these . Wenty stared . He was looking at a lambent forest of festival trees . Every leaf glowed green , giving the forest its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made festive with twinkling bright reds , yellows , oranges , whites , and blues . These lights came from glowing fruits , flowers , and candies dangling from under the limbs . Also dangled wooden toys and fantastic ornaments - stars and horns and human heads and many others . " An enchanted forest , indeed , ha , " he breathed . Wenty had seen noctilucent trees before . But he had never seen - or dreamed of ! - a forest of festival trees . Wondering , he climbed one of them , up through a world of shivering light , till he looked down on the rainbow-spangled pool of glowing emerald that filled a hollow in the dark hills . West rose the mothwing shoulders of the hills , crowned with the distant flicker of the oncoming storm . East still was lit , but the shadow swept over it even as he watched . " High cities were large as counties , " he murmured . " It must be true that their inhabitants were Lucifexes , and flew , huh . " Looking down , Wenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . Descending , he wandered bemused in a land of delights . His mother Ellian used to buy small festival trees as centerpieces for Wenty 's birthday parties . He 'd only seen one big one , the Municipal Tree in Kirkilgowock , and it would have seemed small here tonight . The blotch was , he discovered , the foundation-hole of a considerable building , so old it was nearly filled in , overgrown with ordinary eo-oaks and fyrhs . Here and there stood a section of crumbling stone wall . He pondered this ruin . The Octurian Wars had ended an octury ago . " Someone , famous long ago , planted hedges of lucent trees to light the grounds of his manse on cloudy nights , " he said . " The trees remain though the manse be gone . And no doubt there once were lawns and pleasaunces and game courts , all swallowed now by the festival forest . Famous times they must have had in the evenings , with the celestial lumer above and the festival trees glowing all about . " More importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered armloads of dead wood , wandering dreamlike under the glowing trees , and built a fire on the east side of a bit of wall . Mouth watering , he took a handmeal out of his knapsack and began to strip the husks back . Motion in the green glowing aisles of the festival forest caught his eye and he paused . A thing stepped out and confronted him , a green-litten chiaroscuro of umber and somber shapes and angles . Some weird thrashing machine , it might have been , or a mangle , or a nameless collection of mechanical oddments on the march . No : not nameless . " Killoon , " he breathed , staring . It looked a little like a giant scorpion , two rows of jointed legs , a complicated double head , and four crooked arms with rows of lobsterclaws instead of fingers . The top part of the head was circled with dark , motionless , gem-like eyes ; nocturnal , it could see in the dark . Brown it was , and dark , and deadly , and its ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but from some wild far star beyond all kenning . " You are whom , eh ? " it asked , its voice a rasping rattling toothgrinding sound without a trace of breath in it . It was made , he saw faintly , by the rapid chittering and chattering of many tiny maxillae above the complex mouth in its chest . Clearing his throat , he said , " I am Wenting , heh . " It had a spear level in one " hand " on each side , and kept moving them mechanically toward and away from him . Now it paused in this movement , to regard him with what might have been dubiety . Pause , then the rasp : " You where going  --  going where - you It stopped , and rattled something that sounded like angry words , words Wenty had never heard . Confidently he waited for their meanings to well up from within him , but no meanings came . He stared in amazement . Always before , the meanings had come ; every root word of Tellucent was latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know them . The killoon spoke with the seeming of great care : " You - going where - eh ? " In a sudden illuminating flash Wenty realized that the alien thing spoke another language , a language its ancestors had brought from the stars . Having no instinctive grasp of Tellucent , it had made a simple error on his name . But it was waiting for an answer , pantomiming throwing its spears at him and at him , at him and at him . And this was a killoon , terrible beings who had savagely earned their name . " I am not Going , heh , " he said . " I am Wenting , heh . " Sweating in the heat of the night , he waited . Lightning flashed , muted thunder spoke . The spears paused again in their incessant motion . " Your name is what . Eh ? Eh ? " Wenty stared . After all , he thought , if I am qualified to confuse a cat that also has Tellucent by instinct , can I not confound this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name is What , heh . " The killoon reared backward in some strong , fretful emotion . It began to jab the spears irritatedly at the ground , and their rhythm was broken , jagged . " That is what I asked , ha ! Your - name - is - what - eh ? " " I am Wenting , heh , " he said , throat dry . " My father is Gone , huh . " It lifted its left front foot and doubled it into a fist , slammed it down into the straggly grass with a thud . Then it similarly stomped the foot behind that , and the one behind that , and so on back , then the back foot on the right side and so forward . " You - are - going- how - much - farther - eh ? " it demanded harshly , continuing to ripple its stomping . " I am What ; you are Whom , heh . " Who " is you , eh ? " Wenty 's hearts were shaking his chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . The killoon went from rippling a stomp to dancing sidlingly about , stomping irregularly . " I am not Who , " heh ! Ha ! You am not - not are What , heh ! You all confuse , ha ! You not know own language , ha ! I ask the name of your name , ha ! You say honsenses , ha ! Now I asks you going where - you - you where - what you - who - " It jabbed one spear into the ground and left it there , dancing about and snapping its pincers like castanets . Wenty leaned forward and aggravated it further : " You talk confusedly , ha ! You ask two questions at once , ha ! And you do n't listen to answers , ha ! My name is What , ha ! I am Wenting , ha ! " The killoon 's verbal frustration abruptly became too much for it . Leaving its spear sticking in the sod , it gave a loud rasping Raa-aa-aaaawk ! This furious cry trailed back between the coldly glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off into the night . Wenty took a long deep breath . " I am going to have to sit up all night and watch for it , eh ? " he asked himself uneasily . But then from the east he heard the wailing , roaring cry of a killoon on the hunt . The odds were against its returning . Still , he slept poorly that night . All through his uneasy dreams , the festival forest glowed , green and spangled with eyes , regarding him through the rain that rattled on his waterproof . NEXT MORNING , Wenty rose stiffly in the chilly predawn and munched dried fruit and a couple of handmeals . His gaze kept jerking perkily about . But nothing moved except the drip of water . Packed , Wenty hesitated . But this old manse must have been looted many times . The killoon 's spear . He pulled it out and looked at it . Crudely wrapped to a crude haft was a gleaming scarlet point of hammered coronium . " Coronium , ha ! " The first he 'd ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wenty hefted it , estimated it as worth a dozen gold stars . He climbed a tree . Reflexively he looked at the sky to the west ; the weather was over . To the east he looked anxiously and saw no sign of the - killoon . " Naturally , " he told himself grumpily . Instead he saw blotches of light green amid the evergreen Hestwood . There must once have been a considerable community here , lost now to history and all memory . A community that , perhaps , had left trees still growing in coronium rich soil ? Descending , Wenty turned his steps east . Presently he found an old road - a tunnel through Hestwood . At the far end of it , the rising Sun winked at him . To right and left was a suggestion of cut stone ; fences , he thought . Within an hour he saw an indubitable gate and turned in . The sunlight lanced in over the hills , pitilessly revealing a filled and overgrown hole , utterly mundane . Around were only fyrhs , eo-oaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas , the tabby is impatient , as tabbies always are , and wants her nuptial trip soon , " Wenty said glumly . He went back to the road , hesitated , and pushed on east for a space . He passed several gates , investigated a couple more ruins . " Face it , the spearpoint maybe never came from here at all . And if I spend much more time searching , " Wenty added uneasily , " I 'll find myself benighted again in grounds hunted by the killoon . " Aimlessly he wandered around the grounds of the last ruin . A very substantial place , this , with a huge outer wall . More like a castle , but too big to defend . Possibly the central fort of the forgotten city . He paused . There was a suspicion of order in the huge mossy eo-oaks . They seemed to have been set in rows . " One would plant an orchard of eo-oaks , for why , eh ? " But eo-oaks do n't have trademarks on the undersides of their leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears ; his knees shook and almost gave way beneath him . It was an orchard of adama trees . Wenty came near to fainting . His next coherent thought was , " How lovely they are , huh . " He was looking at goldflakes growing on the massive bole against which he was leaning . He had not dreamed the orchard . Swelling egg-shaped nodules in the bark grew along the underside of every large limb . Many of these nuts were bigger than his fist . Numbly , he tottered over to a fallen limb . With hysterical steadiness he cut into the largest nut with the spearpoint . Damp and rotten , it yielded readily and a smooth plum-shaped stone fell out , big as the last joint of his thumb . Wenty held it up to the light . It was a deep transparent blue that smashed a sunbeam into glancing fragments . Sapphire . Awed , he looked around . Tetrons , sixteens , of adamas . Ancient adamas . They yielded sapphires and rubies and the transparent adamants . It took a lifetime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations to grow the big ones . The ground here must be littered with wealth . Bemused , speechless , he wandered through the orchard , poking at the soil . One row was different . He puzzled numbly over its trademarks . " Smaragdos , ha ! " Rare jewel trees , yielding emeralds , aquamarines , and beryls . Few soils had the constituents of their gems . Their limbs were studded with nuts . The two outer rows of the orchard were quartzite trees , which yielded all the semi-precious stones based on quartz . " No matter . There 's enough wealth in the center . " Wenty 's hearts were racing . He wanted to leap madly on every fallen limb , dig crazily with the spear , see the red and blue and green and clear and rose-colored stones pour into his palm . He counted them : sixteen rows , originally of sixteen trees each , not counting the quartzites . No wonder the massive wall about this orchard . The thought of all the wealth and beauty here made him want to shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a knapsack of gems of every kind . Her ecstatic delight in them , and joy in him . The journey they would take , to remember the rest of their lives . Then he pictured Greling 's expression . But before he could feel sorry for his friend 's disappointment , Grely 's expression changed , became determined . He pictured Grely also presenting Caly with a sack of gems , and her delighted confusion over having to choose . And not just Greling , but all Skitty , rushing to the orchard . And not just Skitty , but all Kirkilgowock . And not just Kirkilgowock , but all the coast of Hitherland would swarm to the orchard . They 'd cut up all the fallen limbs , and kick aside the leaves , and dig up the soil . They 'd climb the trees and cut into the larger nuts , then the middle-sized and small ones , mad for wealth . They 'd squabble over the limbs , and scuffle over the holes they 'd dig . They 'd squat in the orchard and claim the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim . They 'd kill each other . " All for what , eh ? Wealth , eh ? - All this ridiculous wealth , beyond all reason  --  avarice has no use for it . " And Calian  --  proffered all this . What would it do to her ? " It would destroy her , heh , " he answered , horror-struck . She would change from the open , generous , warm-hearted woman he loved into a grasping , selfish , compliment-seeking , wealth-hoarding termagant . That was bad enough , but the horrors contined : " And me , eh ? " he asked . " I am better than they of the coast of Hitherland , eh ? Better than my neighbors of Kirkilgowock , eh ? Better than my friends and relatives of Skitty , eh ? " No , no , and no ; he drew the Short Father on every question . " At bottom we are all Sons of Infamy . " He had dropped the sapphire . Wenty looked at his trembling fingers , wiped them on his pantaloons . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished he had not eaten breakfast at all - wished he had some cold clear water to drink , now ! In school they had taught him a charming myth about the Fall from The Heights . The Lord of the Abyss had tempted Anthroman to invade the forbidden Fields of the Sun . For his presumption , his wings were burned off and he fell to destruction on the glowing Fields . And ever after , the man-kin had been forced to walk and labor for their food . He found himself leaning against a huge tree , wiping his eyes and gulping . It will be all right , he thought . But I 'd better get back to the Hestwater soon . He looked around . In his sickness he had stumbled downhill . This was the last of the jewel trees . An adama , he saw , and the biggest of all ; the drainage of the slope favored it . Yet it seemed to have no nuts . No , there was one , a small one . And there , a smaller one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb , very old and crumbling . He kicked it and it fell into moist powder . Out of the powder fell a golden stone . Wenty stared at it for a long time , then breathlessly bent and picked it up . He could n't quite close his fingers around it . " Auron . " It was the color of transparent gold , a beauty that made him want to weep . The rarest and most valuable gem on the Prime Mondeign . " Because vionium is a nonTabular element , " he told himself gravely . " Very rare . " The auros tree was an adama that colored its adamant with vionium salts . In his shock Wenty had n't consciously heard anything , but was not surprised to find the killoon behind him . It took the auron from his fingers , held it up . A golden beam fell on its upper head . It was wearing a thing like a crown around it . This crown was made of linked flat plates of smoked plastic , to shield its nocturnal eyes from the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rasping voice . " But of no value . " It tossed the auron aside , dismissively . It tilted its upper head and he felt its regard on him through the smoked plastic . In a prescient flash , Wenty felt that it was debating opening the subject of his name and destination . It did n't . " Man-kin will swarm in and trample all over the forest , eh ? " It held a skin sack full of water , and no weapons . After a moment Wenty said , " No , heh . I will go back there , " pointing with the spear to the north , " and I will not come back . " It rattled something killoonish , then said , " That is good , huh . " It started off , swinging its sack . " I have your spear , huh , " Wenty called . " You left it last night , huh . Here , take it , ho . " He proffered it . After some hesitation it accepted it . " It is mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful and useful both . " " Very useful , huh . " For a moment it regarded him through smoked plastic , still , he felt , brooding on the subject of his name . Instead it turned about and made off , soon vanishing in the green and gold of the morning forest . The auron gleamed amid the leaves . With me along the strip of Herbage strown That just divides the desert from the sown , Where the name of Slave and Sultan is forgot And pity Sultan Mahmud on his golden throne ! - Omar/Fitzgerald ONE OF SOCKS 'S remote descendants attacked Wenting 's large knobby bare foot . He reached over with the other foot and bapped it on the head . The kitten looked up at him wide-eyed . " Mew ? " it said , its eyes being open but not its mouth . " They 'll be talking back to you soon enough , " said Greling . " Soon enough , " Wenty said . A beautiful naked young woman ran by them , laughing , and into the Bay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then beat again . In that moment he had traveled years into the past ... he remembered Calian running by him down to the beach for a swim and a wash , on many mornings , many many mornings ago , when he and all the world were young . This was one of her granddaughters . " Ouch , ha , " said Grely , wincing . Another of Socks 's descendants climbed his leg , catstep wince , catstep wince , catstep wince . The kitten sat staring on his knee . " Mew ? " Grely glared , and bent its ear backward . " Mew you , ha ! " It shook its head , arighting the ear , and continued to stare at him . Wenty looked fondly at his old friend . Grely 's hair was thin now , even his crest , and that was silver . His own was thicker , but just as pale and lank . Both their faces were nut-brown . They had aged well , Wenty thought complacently . When they were young , he and Grely looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay , being teased by the tabbies with their long red or golden hair . But now he and his friend looked like nobody else on the Prime Mondeign . Gnarled and crabbed , but individual , distinctive , original . " Poets age well , " Wenty said . " Poets and musicians , " said Grely , rubbing the kitten 's head . " You remember the days of our old ensemble , eh ? You used to be fair with the zootibar ; pity you did n't keep it up . " " I have n't even played the Devotionals for three years ; not since - " - Caly 's death still unspeakable . After a bit , Grely said , " You know , it was the greatest stroke of luck in my life , when you found that auron in the Silking River . " That was the story he 'd put about . Wenty knew of at least seven auronic expeditions up the Silking , one even up onto the plateau of the Tolland . " That was luck for me , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heh . It got for me the best wife a man could have . Harlian consented to be mine the same year you and Caly took your trip to the Farther Islands , you remember . " Wenty could barely remember what he 'd seen on that trip , though Caly 's perpetually surprised and joyful expression would be with him till he died . She had never lost it , in all the years of their marriage . Smiling at his own memories , he looked down at the beach , where a vigorous whitehaired Harly stirred the pot of sea-food and tubers and shouted spiritedly at the romping youths in the reposeful bay . Two kittens pounced on his feet , and he scuffled with them . " Some things never change , thank the Long Father , " he said . Very little change had come to the Bay of Repose in his lifetime . Squatham behind him was platted now , to be left to his youngest grandson . It was no longer a croft , but a respectable dwelling of five rooms . His oldest son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed Skitty from Squatham ; another son lived across the Bay . Caly had found she loved motherhood , and almost alone among the women he knew , had borne a third child . Much as she loved her two sons , her daughter Ylian had become the light of her life , and Wenty 's . Grely had been following his thoughts . " You 've become silent ; you always used to talk . But there 've been no other changes so major , aside from our age . We 've been blessed indeed by the Long Father . " More than you know , Wenty thought . We Sons of Infamy were tempted , in my person , and did not Fall . So there were a couple of plats this side of Skitty , a few more fists squatted on to the south . But few were the adventurers who prowled the Heston Hills ; the Hestwood slept alone . Wenty quirked a smile at a random thought . Far to the east , at the end of the Bay , was a small complacent village : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killoon had wandered , years ago . It wore a crown of smoked plastic lenses and carried a bag of copper nuggets from a copperseed tree . It had exchanged them for scissors , needles , thread , and ornamental buttons . " How wise cats seem , " said Grely , following his own thoughts . " How wise , and how secretive . " " Yes . " Generations might well pass before that deadly orchard was discovered again ... so , let them pass in peace ! Often , in dreams , Wenty found himself there , and the trees now dangled gems like festival tree ornaments , and they sparkled all over the ground in the light of the glowing leaves . Always again in his dreams he was stunned by the wealth , but more by the beauty . Often he had yearned to tell someone his wonderful secret . But he had told not even Caly . He would never tell . He did not talk , he thought , in his sleep ; and nowadays he slept alone , but for the cats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never talk . However much they say , they never talk . " Soup is served , ha ! " Harly cried . Wenty arose with alacrity , displacing kittens . " Come , ha ! My appetite , at least , is as youthful as ever . " t Footnote * 16 myrions , or over a million .
