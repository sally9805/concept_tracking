Q. You were held captive for almost four years , from 1986 to 1990 , half of that time in total isolation . A blindfold always covered your eyes , and often you were chained to a wall ? <P> A. In 44 months I never saw the face of one of my captors . I even slept in my blindfold . Alone in the cell , when I heard no sound outside , I sometimes would raise the blindfold enough to see and then kept it at half-mast . If observed , that meant a beating . <P> Q. Two of those four years you were together with other hostages ? <P> A. For most of 1987 I was in the same room with Terry Anderson and Tom Sutherland . For five months in 1988 two others joined us , Brian Keenan and John McCarthy . The five of us were held in a hideout a couple of hours south of Beirut . But even while together , all of us wore blindfolds . <P> Q. Did treatment improve when you were part of a larger group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with the slow and endless passage of time and sometimes our own brittle feelings . Each of us had different ways of dealing with confinement . Sometimes those differences even caused friction among ourselves . For example , I did n't speak to one of my fellow hostages  --  chained right next to me  --  for three months over some minor personal argument . Another time two of the hostages got into a fight over some trivial disagreement and started hitting each other . The constant tension led from time to time to irrational behavior . <P> Q. You are speaking out more bluntly than other released hostages . You seem ! less willing to contain your resentments . In prison , for example , unlike the others , you refused to accept books and television and even exercise privileges . Why so different ? <P> A. I tried to escape twice . I suppose that says something about me too . I 've always been dogged and independent-minded . Sometimes my fellow hostages pleaded with me to take books or special treatment . The way I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I tried hard to get into their consciences , to make them feel guilty . Sometimes that invited harsh treatment . Even then , when they beat me , I was determined never to cry out . <P> Q. The President and the State Department did tell Americans to get out of Beirut . You chose to stay . So were n't you asking for trouble ? <P> A. I keep hearing that question , almost as a challenge . Look , I ran a school for 600 Arab children , right through a horrible war . That school meant everything to me . My wife is an Arab . Yes , I put myself at risk . But I had important reasons for staying . Incidentally , the President 's order was issued after I was kidnapped . <P> Q. How clearly do you remember the first months of confinement after you were seized in September 1986 ?
