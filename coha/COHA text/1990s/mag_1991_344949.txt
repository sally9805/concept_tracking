Assigning the Blame for a Young Man 's Suicide Deeply depressed , Adrian Adelman , 29 , killed himself in September . ETHEL ADELMAN , the victim 's mother , and her younger son ALAN claim that Adrian followed the instructions in the best-selling suicide manual Final Exit , and blame the book 's author for their tragedy . <P> Q. Do you think Adrian would still be alive if he had not read Final Exit ? <P> Ethel : Yes . I think he would still be here today if it were n't for this book . <P> Alan : He would still be suffering and suicidal , but the book certainly facilitated his death . This book took his life away . <P> Q. Why did Adrian turn to Final Exit ? <P> Alan : He was 29 . He had been suffering from major depression for seven months . As far as we know , he became a member of the Hemlock Society ( ( a group co- founded by Derek Humphry that advocates the right of the terminally ill to take their own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25 . They do n't screen members . <P> Q. Why are you so angry at the book 's author , Derek Humphry ? <P> Alan : Because he published a book that we consider very dangerous . <P> , Ethel : Some people want to kill themselves , but they ca n't find an easy way . Humphry outlines it step by step , even to fooling your doctors to get Seconal . This is why we 're angry . <P> Alan : I 'd call it a suicide cookbook . It tells you which drugs are most effective , which are least effective , how to combine drugs with alcohol , how to enhance the toxicity of certain drugs . It 's very , very explicit . <P> Q. Had Adrian talked about or ever attempted suicide before ? <P> Alan : Yes , I do n't know if it was a very determined attempt . At times he spoke so morbidly we were n't sure whether he actually tried something or not . <P> But we did not ignore it at all . He announced his intention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk him out of it , to reason with him , to show him that that was the wrong way to alleviate his pain , that it was , as his therapist called it , a permanent solution to a temporary problem  --  depression . <P> Q. How can you be sure that the book affected his actions ? <P> Ethel : He talked about the book . He ordered it . When it came , we did n't give it to him . We hid it in the closet . <P> Alan : I read part of it , so we knew what it was about . He went out and purchased another one . <P> He followed the format in the book exactly . On page 81 , the book says that if the survivors want to cover up the suicide , they can refuse an autopsy on religious grounds . Unless , of course , the state has a compelling reason to perform the autopsy , the wishes of the family will be respected . <P> Ethel : He left notes , like this one : " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Jewish law . " And this kid did n't know the first thing about Jewish law , because we 're not that religious . <P> Alan : On page 88 , the book tells you what letters to write , gives you a format to use , instructs you to prepare and leave a copy of your living will and to appoint a power of attorney for health care . He did it all . <P> Ethel : It 's in the book , and it 's in his notes : " If I am discovered before I have stopped breathing , I forbid anyone , including doctors or paramedics , to attempt to revive me . If I am revived , I shall sue . " He followed the format .
