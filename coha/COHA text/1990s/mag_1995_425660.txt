SURE , THESE CEOS STILL SUBSTITUTE IMAGINATION , KNOW-HOW , AND EFFORT FOR CAPITAL . SOMETIMES <p> O NCE A BOOTSTRAPPER , ALWAYS A BOOT-strapper ? Not quite . If you 're going to move beyond the start-up phase , there are habits that have to be undone and skills that have to be honed to jibe with your company 's growth and maturity . It does n't happen in a single day , but gradually you may find that your business no longer benefits from certain policies and procedures you insisted upon when it was a struggling start-up . For example ... <p> THEN : If you did n't have it , you did n't spend it . <p> NOW : You borrow . It 's OK to owe . <p> THERE COMES A STAGE IN THE GROWTH CYCLE OF ALmost any business when the need arises for an infusion of outside capital . And that need , once recognized , changes everything  --  how you present your company , how you present yourself , how you spend your time , even how you define the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they 're unavoidable . If you want to grow , you may have to owe . Or even let go . <p> Karen Behnke financed PacificCare Wellness Co. , now a $6-million health-services company , with credit cards  --  a very grand total of 17 credit cards  --  and proceeds from the sale of personal belongings ( her skis , her car ) . Sound familiar ? <p> Back then , Behnke says , first thing each morning she 'd read her cash and receivables report . She guesses she spent about 25% of her time managing cash flow , just making sure she had money enough to pay the bills . Then three years ago she sold her company to a multibillion-dollar health-maintenance organization and stayed on as president . Now that her company has access to deep pockets and survival is less problematic , she 's free to devote more of her time to issues of marketplace presence and long-term goal setting : marketing ( 25% ) , strategic planning ( 50% ) , and financial planning ( 25% ) . <p> Taking on new roles can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TofuRella ( " tastes , melts , and stretches just like regular cheese " ) , would rather he did n't have to spend quite as much time explaining himself and his business to bankers . Rose calls himself a " counterculture businessperson " and " the longest-haired M.B.A . in Santa Rosa " ; last summer he toured as guest guitarist for a band called the Pink Flamingos . He says it 's a bit weird getting used to the idea that because the local bank gave him a $160,000 line of credit , " it 's no longer just me doing what I feel like . " Still , he 's been able to maintain control of his persona and his style . <p> " I cut my hair off and wore suits and stuff for a couple of years , " he says . " I thought I needed to do that to make it in the business world . And it did n't work . So I went back to plan B , and that was to be myself . And it 's working fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NOW : You sin sometimes , but that 's a good thing . <p> EVERY DAY FRED DELUCA , OWNER AND CEO of Subway , a chain of 9,109 franchise sandwich shops , buys lunch for the employees at headquarters  --  all 400 of them . Once a month he invites them to the movies , along with their family and friends . He figures all that probably costs him , oh , about $300,000 a year . But he 's just guessing , and he 's not too worried about it . <p> DeLuca does those things partly because he 's a nice guy , but mainly for reasons even his chief financial officer would accept . A free lunch on the premises , he reasons , keeps the staff from straying in the middle of the workday . It saves time and encourages shoptalk . Of course , it makes people happy , too . And happy workers , DeLuca believes , are productive workers . <p> Sacrifice and self-denial , especially in the beginning , are part of the game . Later on , when the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well the days when , perhaps like DeLuca , you diverted $14 a week , no more , from cash flow for personal needs . How could you forget ? It was hard , sure , but heroic . Every dollar reinvested , every penny redeployed . And yet , as DeLuca has come to appreciate , " it 's virtually impossible to keep doing things that way . " You change because you must . <p> Likewise , there comes a time in every growing company 's life when it 's no longer appropriate to do business in , say , a two-bedroom apartment . Jim Noble of Noble Oil Services did that for years , and managed just fine  --  until he began going after the kind of clients whose comfort levels plummet when you take their coats and offer them seats at the kitchen table . <p> " You have to give those things up because your role and your company 's position have changed , " says Noble , who four years ago finally left the apartment for a real office . " What started out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice furniture , dress codes  --  those are things you have to grow into to make it all work . " <p> THEN : A customer was a customer . A job was a job . Who were you to say no ? <p> NOW : You can afford to be more choosy , and it pays . <p> THE BUSINESS OF ALL AMERICAS INC. , IN Vancouver , Wash. , is brokering freight . Truckers call , looking for loads . Shippers call , looking for trucks . Agents scare up business in the field . <p> Time was , Linda Wilsdon , president of All Americas , would almost never say no . When a customer called , any customer , she was ready . " Get the freight , " she says , outlining her survival strategy in those days . " Get it on the truck , get it moved , get it to where it 's money to us . And worry about everything else later . " <p> Now that Wilsdon 's company 's sales have grown to $4.4 million , she 's much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " she 's more likely to tell her sales staff . " Let 's look at this customer . How does he pay ? Is he slower than everyone else in the industry ? How long are we going to wait for our money ? What will it cost us to wait ? " <p> Jim Noble of Noble Oil Services wishes now he 'd asked more questions in the winter of 1989 , when he was invited to bid on a big job in upstate New York . " Of course , when you 're a small company , you do n't want to tell people , ' We ca n't go that far , ' " says Noble , from his office in Sanford , N.C. " We jumped on a plane . " <p> It turned out to be the job from hell frozen over : removing asphalt from oil tanks , in January , in Buffalo . Southern boys , Noble and his crew knew nothing about hard-hat liners or arctic work gear , but they learned quickly . <p> The general contractor , Hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to please , refused . " I said , ' What do you mean ? When we 're done and we 've performed , we 'll send you a bill . What else have you got that we can do ? ' " <p> Noble had bid $196,000 on the job . Expenses to date totaled $140,000 when suddenly , Hazardous Waste Management filed Chapter 11 . The bonding company refused to make good , Mobil Oil ( owner of the asphalt-encrusted tang ) shrugged its corporate shoulders , and Noble was screwed . He started borrowing money from banks back home , $50,000 here , $75,000 there . <p> " I had maybe two loans on the same receivables at two different banks , " says Noble , " and both banks had liens . I guess to some degree I really did some unethical things . I say I guess I did something wrong  --  ha ! I know I did . I was really juggling . " <p> What Noble learned : " Give me money before I get rolling . I need a down payment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be shy . " <p> And , yes , some jobs just ai n't worth it . <p> THEN : What , me plan ? When 's the next payroll ? <p> NOW : You take the long view , and you mark your course . <p> WHEN IT COMES TO CAPITAL OUTLAYS , Douglas Otto , founder of Deckers , a $57-million outdoor-footwear manufacturer , is uncompromising . He demands a one-year return on investment . Unlike most owners who depreciate assets and figure that money saved over many years is worth the investment , Otto demands an instant payoff . " We concentrate on stuff that saves us money within a year . Things can become obsolete pretty quick , and everything has to pay for itself . " <p> Well , sure , if you make a consumer product , fast and flexible is it . But that does n't mean you ca n't strategize . Sooner or later , you have to . It may mean investing in capital equipment that seems beyond your means . Rinaldo Brutoco , who runs the catalog company Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come to recognize the value in such expenditures . " You get a computer system that works and you do n't have to make do with something that 's fundamentally broken , " he explains . " We spent $100,000 last summer to upgrade our network . The difference it makes in people 's peace of mind is enormous . These types of purchases have to be made . " <p> Or it may mean learning how to think in blocks of time longer than six months . Tom 's of Maine CEO Tom Chappell , for instance , pulled together a board of directors in 1981 , 11 years into the building of his family 's personal-care-products company . Chappell looked for people who were strong in areas where he felt weak  --  general management , marketing , financing , organization , psychology  --  and asked them to help develop a 5-year strategic plan for the company . Their task : figure out how to expand distribution from health-food stores to the mass market . " I was at a point where I knew I needed more ideas than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You thrived on fear , chaos , and the great unknown . <p> NOW : You plan ahead , you stick to the schedule , you eat dinner with your family , Suprise ! You function better that way . <p> OK , SO NOT EVERYBODY GETS FROM THEN to now on this one  --  or wants to . Tom Chappell insists that while he 's learned to temper his type-A personality , ultimately , " I do n't value being comfortable . I think that 's stupid . " <p> Moreover , at Subway , Fred DeLuca attacks creeping complacency by sending all his territory leaders multiple voice-mail missives  --  as many as 10 a day  --  filled with scary intelligence on competitors and other motivational stuff The voice-mail system with toll-free access costs about $150,000 annually . The 3,500 informal training videos DeLuca sends out as conditions warrant run about $12,000 for each mailing . It 's all money well spent , he maintains , because " there are advantages to being on edge . " <p> Jim Noble , on the other hand , after 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always have to run quite as hard as he used to , and he 's grateful for that . Plus he 's convinced he accomplishes more in 60 focused hours these days than he did in 90 frenzied hours back when he was still in bootstrapping mode . <p> But even Noble finds that too much calm in the workplace  --  too little pressure , not enough stress  --  makes him nervous . That 's what he discovered when he gave up day-to-day control of the division that handles spills and other cleanup jobs and the new guy changed the culture . <p> " He has allotted for a little bit of the chaos , " Noble concedes . " But he 's got work scheduled out several weeks . I used to schedule out only two or three days . Everything was a juggle , and I enjoyed trying to make it work . You had only so many pieces of equipment , and everyone had deadlines to meet . I 've always thought of myself as a whore . It 's like the television commercial  --  I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get off the phone and say , ' How the hell am I going to do that ? ' And my job is to get it done , not to tell the client , ' No , we ca n't accommodate you . ' <p> " Now my manager says no sometimes , and it 's tough for me to hear that . I guess I had created that culture . I enjoyed it , and we made money with it . Maybe in my mind , I still think that 's what it takes to make that area of our business go . I try to stay away from there . I think it actually runs better when I do n't mess with it . " <p> THEN : Size was an issue . You had to fool the world into thinking you were bigger , badder , and more established than you really were . <p> NOW : Size is still an issue . Only now the game is making sure your customers know you 're still small enough to care . <p> " WE FAKED IT TO SOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you deal with big super-market buyers , you need fancy business cards , four-color pictures . It 's presentation and confidence . " <p> It 's a classic start-up seam : coming off as something you 're not . You learn little tricks  --  referring to yourself as vice-president of your one-person show , playing a cassette of a low din of voices in the background when you take calls , making liberal use of the first-person plural . You have to smooth over slips of the tongue : " Did I say we 're two years old ? I mean , uh , one . Practically one . " <p> For Snapple Beverage , it meant taking a crapshoot and putting all the company 's advertising money into celebrity endorsements . For a while , in the mid-to-late 1980s , all the company 's ad dollars went to Howard Stern , who yapped about the product on his radio show . Later Snappie spent half its ad budget on tennis star Ivan Lendl . Snappie CEO Leonard Marsh says it was worth it . " When we went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stuff and see Ivan Lendl 's picture , and right away they thought , ' Oh ! These guys are big ! He must cost a lot of money . ' And he did ! But we wanted to show people we were very serious about growing . " <p> Now that the company 's sales have grown to more than a half billion dollars , Snapple has another kind of problem : how to maintain its " We 're just folks , we 're not PepsiCo " persona . So it has added Rush Limbaugh to the parade of media pitchmen , in addition to featuring national TV spots with neighborly , down-home customers . The message : we 're established but local , solid but quirky , big-league but still fresh , a phenom  --  the $516-million public company that does n't feel corporate . Not easy . <p> THEN : You gave them start-up experience and maybe some equity . What more could employees want ? <p> NOW : Bucks . You want talent , you pay for it . <p> WHEN MARK COHN LAUNCHED DAMARK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff last year , he could n't offer much in the way of cold , hard cash to prospective employees . " Back then , " Cohn recalls , " we were selling people on being on a rocket ship to the moon . " A ticket was often enticement enough . <p> Eight years later Damark ca n't sell that buzz anymore . " Now the compensation system is different , absolutely , " Cohn says , " because we 're trying to attract different kinds of people . Clearly , today we 're compensating in a much more thoughtful and much more professional way . " Besides , Damark does n't look poor anymore , so it ca n't pay lean , mean wages . " Today you pull up to the building , " says Cohn , " and it 's hard for people to remember the time when you did n't know if you were going to be able to meet payroll , and you did n't know if the catalog was ever going to work or whether you 'd be able to finance the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Robert and Ellen Wallace , who rounded Arizona Sun Products , have learned much the same lesson . " I used to hire people at low rates , but I 've had to rethink that , " Robert says . " It 's the same with everything else . Better phones , faster computer systems . If you want quality , you have to pay for quality . " <p> Partly it 's a case of learning the hard way . You start out with cheap and you make do  --  until you finally admit that cheap is n't good enough . " At the beginning I could n't afford to pay a premium for an employee , " says Bejan Douraghy , founder of Artisan Professional Free-lance Representatives , in Chicago , " and my turnover was high . That 's really changed , especially in the last year . Now I pay people what they deserve . I 've recruited people from Fortune 500 companies , and I 've really gotten a good team together . " <p> But also , as your business grows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist at the beginning , and someone 's got to take care of them . " After a while , " says Jim Noble , " the company 's growing quicker than you can grow , and you say , ' Hey , it 's going to be in everyone 's best interest if I recruit senior management . ' " <p> Still , he had trouble paying serious money for senior managers when he was paying himself only $35,000 . " It was hard to bring in a $90,000 guy , " Noble says . " I did n't have a good understanding of what a guy like that did to make his money . " <p> He does now . <p> THEN : You were the whole show . <p> NOW : Others have key roles . You 're the producer . <p> I 'VE GONE THROUGH TWO BIG TRANSItions with staff resources , " says Subway 's Fred DeLuca . " First I went from having no resources at all , to finally getting the resources and learning how to manage them . Now I 'm at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they have to do , the worst thing I can do is overmanage . " <p> Delegating is a simple concept , granted , but it 's among the toughest skills an entrepreneur must learn , and the most important . <p> " It was hard for me , " DeLuca says . " But I learned that as the boss , I could be a really serious obstacle to people 's getting their work done . I 'd jump up and run over to the next office and say to our marketing guy , ' I just had a great idea ! ' and I 'd give him an assignment . One day he said to me , ' Fred , it 's wonderful you have these great ideas , but you 've got to give me enough time to get the last great idea done . ' And it struck me that I was creating far too much turmoil for people to work . " <p> Part of what helped DeLuca begin to undo bad habits was franchising the operation in 1974 . Faced with the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he learned a new set of communication skills . " I realized I had to switch from an authoritarian to a persuasive style of management . I had to be able to explain what I wanted so it made sense . And that was a revelation . " <p> THEN : You and your company were one . <p> NOW : You 're still friends , but you 've given each other room to grow . <p> PARTLY IT 'S A MONEY THING . IF YOU 'RE like most people , not only did you start out by putting all your personal assets at risk ; long after you were established , you continued to guarantee business loans with personal assets . <p> And partly it 's a matter of the heart . At the beginning , success , failure , embarrassment , accomplishment  --  whatever happened to your company happened to you . If the company won , you won . If the company took a pounding , you suffered . Nothing could keep you apart . <p> That kind of relationship is hard to escape . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very hard for me to separate the risk I take and the risk the company takes . Even though I know they 're separate , I still feel that I 'm totally responsible . " <p> For Tom Chappell , it has been a fitful process , marked over the years by a slow-growing acceptance that at least a few other people in this world may care about Tom 's of Maine almost as much as he does . Those people have helped give Tom 's a life apart from Tom . " You have to go through some struggle to know how committed people are , " he says . " Before , I would have regarded it as a weakness not to have all the answers and be the leader . I do n't feel that way now . " <p> Mark Cohn 's epiphany occurred on an airplane in 1989 , three years after he 'd founded Damark with David Russ . On that day , a slow , subtle shift achieved critical mass . Not that Cohn was n't needed anymore ; he just was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that yes , within limits , things would take care of themselves back at the office . It was still his company , but it had a life of its own . <p> " I used to run to the phone the moment I got off the plane , " says Cohn . " And I did n't that day . It was a wonderful feeling .
