In the past several years , Adam-Troy Castro has developed quite a name for himself , mostly as a horror writer . His cover story for F &SF,; " Locusts , " ( February ) confirmed that reputation . Now he returns with a story that 's difficult to classify . <p> Writers deal with the U.S. Postal Service more than most people , and sometimes that can be a terrifying experience . Adam-Troy Castro , who has lived in New York and Florida , takes a look at the possible causes of such unpleasantries in " Neither Rain nor Sleet . " <p> Arthur Dexter Bradley has a pale and waterlogged look , more appropriate for a soiled towel than a human being , perspiration coats his freckled forehead like a second skin , reflecting the overhead fluorescents in blinding little circlets of light . Seen in the right light , he gives off visible steam , which rises from his uniformed body like cigarette smoke , collecting near the ceiling where it merges with the vapors of the coworkers sorting letters on either side of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms of the Mayflower Street Branch of the United States Post Office are deliberately kept cold all year long , and everybody damned to this place constantly puffs out little clouds of white . But Arthur Dexter Bradley gives off more vapor than most , because of the two layers of aluminum foil safely hidden beneath his long-sleeves and cardigan . It locks in his heat , boils his blood , keeps him from becoming a fireball capable of incinerating every envelope that passes between his burn-scarred hands . Because Arthur Dexter Bradley is a bomb . <p> * * * The tiny little woman to his left , Nancy Kaye , mumbles to herself all day long ; her mad scarlet eyes darting back and forth between her hands and her tray and the next tray on her endless pile of trays still left to be done . By comparison , the hulking man to Arthur 's right , Tyrone Wilson , is quiet most of the time , devoting all his intense concentration to the job at hand ; the ungraceful slabs of meat that he uses as hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope to its rightful place . It would be easy to mistake him as merely good at his job , unless you looked in his eyes , and saw the murderous hatred for every piece of mail before him . Tyrone wants the recipient of each envelope to die horribly . He wants them sewed into sacks with knots of anacondas , made to eat ground glass till their buttholes bleed , shackled to the rear bumpers of monster trucks and driven fast over cobblestones . Some , of course , he loathes more the others : the addressees of the Publisher 's Clearing House Sweepstakes in particular . He memorizes addresses , and , sometimes , when the Space Aliens dictate , makes personal visits . <p> Arthur Dexter Bradley found out he was a bomb on the day he started ticking ; and not merely with a heartbeat , but with a steady , clocklike rhythm unmistakably the sound of a major thermonuclear weapon . He found out he was leaking corrosive gas when he woke up in the middle of the night and saw the poisonous glowing haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockmarked with so many burns it resembled the surface of the moon . Arthur Dexter Bradley does n't question how this happened to him , because he already understands that it 's a complex Chemical reaction caused by too many years of close proximity to the undetonated nuclear material near his heart . He just takes solace in his aluminum-foil precautions , and patiently waits for the next fifteen-minute break , which is when the Space Aliens have informed him will be the most advantageous time to explode . <p> Arthur Dexter Bradley would never notice it in a million years  --  mostly because the cues are so subtle that even a sane man attuned to such things would fail to notice it  --  but Nancy Kaye is in love with him . She has loved him ever since her exile away from the stamp counter , where she used to work until her constantly muttered invective drew one too many complaints from frightened customers . Nancy Kaye felt a deep abiding shame at this separation from the normal world , which she considered akin to tossing her through a trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the little round stool by Arthur 's side and felt the first gasp of visible breath billow between her lipstick-stained teeth , she resolved to come back in the morning with her Uzi , and spray lead until the SWAT team came to take her down , just like she had the last time . But Arthur Dexter Bradley shifted positions then , entirely without looking at her ; and his arms and legs made crinkling noises , like a sandwich being unwrapped ; and the invisible baked-potato gases flowed into her mouth and filled her lungs ; and without knowing why , she knew that for as long as she lived she wanted nothing more than to sit beside this lovely , loving man with the aluminum foil poking out between his sleeves and pour out her heart and soul . Which she does . It 's a mad heart and soul , unfortunately ; one that fails to resonate with the madness of her one true love ; one that Arthur has so far dismissed as typical insane muttering no different from the equally insane muttering of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not recognize this as the True Love that it is . But that 's all right . Because the Space Aliens know , and they will impart the truth to him , at the right time . Specifically , just before the next fifteen-minute break . <p> The Postmaster walks behind Arthur and Nancy and Tyrone and the rest of the abused little slaves at his command , whacking his bloodied palm with a whisk . There is some persuasive reason why it has to be a whisk and not the steak knife he used to use ; he 's certain of that , but ca n't remember what that reason is , even though his palm is crisscrossed with scars and he ca n't move three out of the four fingers on that hand . All he knows is that the Space Aliens appeared before him in the middle of the night and suggested , nay not suggested , insisted , that if he had to indulge that little tic of his then a whisk would probably be more appropriate . And he always does what the Space Aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterminds behind the United States Post Office , and he owes them his allegiance both body and soul . The Postmaster used to be like like everybody else ; he used to be merely human . He used to come to work in a sickly blue shirt and a phallic pink tie and shoes that squeaked like dying mice . He used to flash a grin disfigured by the deep black fissures between his teeth . And all the mail carriers and counter help and sorters and customer service reps used to hate him , plotting various evil things to do to his white-wall radials while he was safely ensconced in his office dreaming up new ways to corrupt the business of delivering the mail . And then , one day , when he was sitting at his desk drawing bullet wounds on the lingerie models in the morning paper , the two halves of the east wall of his office just slid open , like the wonderfully accommodating doors on the original Star Trek , revealing , not the parking lot that should have been on the other side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the Space Aliens descended through that portal and said , You Are The First . And from that moment on everything changed . He still comes to work in a sickly blue shirt and a phallic pink tie , he still wears shoes that squeak like dying mice , and he still goes home at night to a wife who despises him and two kids who ignore him , and to the world at large he 's exactly like he was before , but he 's evolved way past the drudgery of civil service . Now , he 's The Postmaster . And at the start of the next fifteen-minute break , all the world will know his wrath . <p> Tyrone Wilson does n't need to hear the constant thwack-thwack-thwack of whisk against flesh to know that the Postmaster is skulking about , spying on him , plotting all sorts of evil mischief against him ; he knows because the Space Aliens have told him this , not just once but repeatedly , using the mail itself . Tyrone 's method of communicating with the Space Aliens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tray , he smuggles it home , and reads it carefully after first covering two out of every three words with the appropriate color of white-out . The secret messages revealed in this manner are always enigmatic , always disjointed , always disturbing . . . but usually comprehensible , in a way that can only make sense to an experienced postal worker like Tyrone . And last night 's stack of letters all seemed to agree on one thing , most succinctly stated by an upstate college student 's ardent declaration of " Dear I having time trouble school found ha seriously ha roommate ha gay expect work have with less ha wondering loan ha love "  --  a clear indication that the Space Aliens are displeased with the current Postmaster 's insufficient degree of fanaticism on their behalf and are merely awaiting the proper moment to process his bones into glue for the back of first-class stamps . Tyrone thinks this is a dandy idea , since the Postmaster is an asshole . But Tyrone is next in the line of succession , so the Postmaster is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own life . So Tyrone 's planning to strike preventively . Next fifteen-minute break , the Postmaster 's toast . <p> Nancy Kaye 's endless muttering has just intensified , becoming more frantic , more desperate , more ruled by mortal fear . That 's because , against all odds , every single piece of mail in her overflowing tray is addressed to her  --  her , Nancy Kaye , who rarely gets mail of any kind , not even bills , since the hospital appointed that conservator to take care of such things for her . But today she has mail from Los Angeles and Shreveport and Albany and Raleigh and Guam : she has air-mail from South America and mailgrams from Tallahassee and even postcards from Show Low , and they 're all addressed to her , and they 're all addressed to her , and they 're all addressed to her , and dammit , they 're ALL . ADDRESSED . TO . HER . Even her keenly mathematical intellect refuses to calculate the odds of that being a coincidence . There must be a bizarre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we know it , something from if not precisely the twilight zone then at least from some neighboring postal district . . . and as the endless stack of her own mail parades by before her eyes Nancy Kaye succumbs to the overwhelming need to know and claws open the flap of a **26;852;TOOLONG manila envelope sent to her by a pharmacist in Intercourse , Pennsylvania . The letter inside has been constructed of letters clipped from magazines : it informs her in no uncertain terms that unless she takes immediate action , the love of her life , Mr. Arthur Dexter Bradley , will be mortally wounded in an attempt to prevent Tyrone Wilson from brutally assassinating the Postmaster during the next break period . The letter goes on to say that this special warning comes courtesy of the Space Aliens , who feel Mr. Arthur Dexter Bradley to be a person of truly cosmic significance , whose life must be preserved if the universe , and of course , the post office , is to survive the truly apocalyptic days up ahead . Nancy Kaye herself is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's evil plans even at the cost of her own life ; but the Space Aliens go on to assure her that should she happen to survive this mission , they will reward her by arranging Arthur Dexter Bradley 's undying devotion . The next ten letters in her stack all make the same promise . She steals a quick look at Tyrone Wilson 's swift and murderous hands , cringes at the very thought of them stealing the life from the only man she will ever love , and decides : next fifteen-minute break , Wilson is toast . <p> And next to Nancy Kaye sits Mike Finelli , whom the Space Aliens have instructed to wire his battered jeep , even now ticking away in the parking lot , to blow up at the beginning of the next fifteen-minute break ; and beside Mike Finelli sits Foster Simmons , who the Space Aliens have instructed in the fine art of reservoir poisoning , and whose latest venture in this creative line of endeavor should start taking effect in the city 's hospitals at the start of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool which would have belonged to Elena Colton , who has stayed at home on the advice of Space Aliens to stalk the Orchid society president she intends to assassinate at the start of the next fifteen-minute break ; and out the door and across the hall by the sorting machine stands Ken Houghton , who has under the well-meaning advice of Space Aliens fed his college chum Greg into the front loader preparatory for a massive folding and spindling at the start of the next fifteen-minute break ; and up front by the stamp desk stands Eddie Leverick , whose pretense of searching the space underneath the counter is actually a cover for loading and locking the bazooka the Space Aliens have advised him to show the folks on the express line at the start of his next fifteen-minute break ; and out upon the city streets a dozen mail carriers drive around in their little jeeps twitching just a little more oddly than they have on any previous day , waiting for the moment of truth ; and in all the other neighborhood branches of United States Post Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the country , every single solitary postal employee alive awaits the moment for which the Space Aliens have so diligently prepared them ; and of course they 're all synchronized , to the precise same instant , roaring toward all of us at the speed of light . <p> And at the center of it all sits Arthur Dexter Bradley , with the aluminum foil underwear and the nuclear-reactor blood , still efficiently sorting junk mail by zip code , still giving off toxic steam , still showing incredible accuracy despite the imminence of the conflagration building up inside him . The big moment is now less than a minute away ; there is no longer anything that can be done to avoid it ; a million separate species of madness are about to be unleashed upon the world ; and the Space Aliens who arranged it are already fleeing through their warp initiators in search of some other planet with post office employees . At the moment everything goes down , most of Arthur Dexter Bradley 's colleagues across the country will experience hell on Earth . Arthur Dexter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen ions by then , will experience absolutely nothing . But in the last few seconds immediately before his detonation , a hypnotic suggestion implanted in his brain by the Space Aliens makes him look up , and face Nancy Kaye . Their eyes meet , and true understanding passes between them . He winks . And she sticks a Nixon stamp on his nose . <p> <p> By Adam-Troy Castro <p>
