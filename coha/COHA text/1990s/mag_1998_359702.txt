TALK AI N'T CHEAP <P> Last week talk-show hostesses OPRAH WINFREY and ROSEANNE vied for the arguable honor of conducting the first non-grand jury grilling of Monica Lewinsky . When negotiations with Winfrey seemed to fall apart , allegedly because Lewinsky asked for money , Roseanne picked up the ball and offered some  --  a lot , in fact . If Lewinsky is still debating her choice , we offer some points to consider . <P> ROSEANNE Familiar with being a social pariah <P> On first show , featured a Linda Tripp impersonator , identified as a " big fat snitch " <P> Said on Larry King Live she thinks the President loved Lewinsky <P> Offered seven figures <P> OPRAH Could set up a tie-in with the book club for when Lewinsky eventually writes her memoirs <P> Does really good makeovers <P> Many people actually watch her show <P> Does n't pay for guests <P> THANK YOUR PLUCKY STAR <P> Jimmy Carter may want to watch his back . The American racking up the most humanitarian interventions these days is TOM CRUISE , who extended his string of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . Hearing cries for help , Cruise , emboldened no doubt by the presence of his bodyguards , ran to assist a woman being robbed of her jewelry . Cruise is no neophyte knight in Armani armor . At a 1996 premiere of Mission : Impossible he lifted two boys over a barricade to prevent them from being crushed . A few months later , while sailing in the Mediterranean , he rescued castaways from a burning boat . Also that year , he swooped in to comfort a hit-and-run victim and paid her hospital bill . Just another lucky citizen , saved by the beau . <P> CHILLA IN MANILA <P> It 's not exactly a fatwa , but in her own adorably angst-ridden way , actress CLAIRE DANES has provoked the ire of a foreign government . While filming the movie Brokedown Palace earlier this year in Manila , she managed to miss the more tourist-friendly aspects of the Philippine capital . Recalling her experience in an interview with Premiere magazine , Danes , who apparently possesses a keen nose , recalled that the city " smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city as " ghastly and weird . " The proud members of the Manila city council could take no more . In a 23-to-3 vote , they agreed to ban all movies in which Danes appears . Philippine President Joseph Estrada said she " should not even be allowed to set foot " in the country . Danes issued a statement saying her comments were misunderstood , but the actress , who just began her freshman year at Yale , may want to consider some classes in diplomacy . <P> HARMONIC DIVERGENCE
