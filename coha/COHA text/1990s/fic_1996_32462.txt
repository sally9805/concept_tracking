From the circumstances , Dortmunder would say it was a missing-heir scam . It had begun a week ago , when a guy he knew slightly , a fella called A.K.A. because he operated under so many different names , phoned him and said , " Hey , John , it 's A.K.A. here , I 'm wondering , you got the flu , something like that ? We do n't see you around the regular place for a while . " " Which regular place is that ? " Dortmunder asked . " Armweery 's . " " Oh , yeah , " Dortmunder said . " Well , I been cuttin back . I might see you there sometime . " Off the phone , Dortmunder looked up the address of Armweery 's and went there , and A.K.A. was at a booth in the back , under the loose lips sink ships poster where some wag had blacked out most of the Jap 's teeth . " What this is , " A.K.A. said , under his new mustache ( this one was gingery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " is a deposition . A week from Thursday , 10:00 a.m. , this lawyer 's office in the Graybar Building . Take maybe an hour . You go in , they swear you , ask you some questions , that 's it . " " Do I know the answers ? " " You will . " " What 's in it for me ? " " Half a gee . " Five hundred dollars for an hour 's work ; not so bad . If , of course . Depending . Dortmunder said , " What 's the worst that could happen ? " A.K.A. shrugged . " They go looking for Fred Mullins out on Long Island . " " Who 's he ? " " You . " " Got it , " Dortmunder said . " There 'll also be a lawyer on our side there , " A.K.A. told him . " I mean , the side of the guy that 's running this thing . The lawyer is n't in on what 's going down , by him you are Fred Mullins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the other side does n't stray from the program . And at the end of it , in the elevator , he gives you the envelope . " " Sounds okay . " " Easy as falling off a diet , " A.K.A. said , and handed him a manila envelope , which he took home and opened , to find it contained a whole story about one Fredric Albert Mullins and an entire family named Anadarko , all living on Red Tide Street out in Carrport between 1972 and 1985 . Dortmunder diligently memorized it all , having his faithful companion May deposition him on the information every evening when she came home from the Safeway supermarket where she was a cashier . And then , on the following Wednesday , the day before his personal private show was to open , Dortmunder got another call from A.K.A. , who said , " You know that car I was gon na buy ? " Uh oh . " Yeah ? " Dortmunder said . " You were gon na pay five hundred for it , I remember . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.K.A. said , " it 's a real lemon , got unexpected problems . In a word , it wo n't run . " " And the five hundred ? " " Well , you know , John , " A.K.A. said , " I 'm not buying the car . "
