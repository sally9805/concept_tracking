YUPPIE <P> BORN : 1983 <P> DIED : 1991 <P> Let not ambition mock their frivolous ways , <P> Their pricey joys and consumer craze . <P> Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful twitch <P> The short and selfish annals of the nouveau rich . <P> The causes of death were family , finances and fatigue . The tasteful tombstone is set amid the soothing green of a field of Perrier bottles . <P> Even now I can not believe it is really over . Since early 1983 , when the term first appeared in print , more than 22,000 magazine and newspaper articles have featured the word yuppie . Can this torrent be at an end ? <P> As a card-carrying baby boomer , I take this death personally . Not that I ever was really a yuppie , of course . But walking the greed-locked streets of Manhattan at the dawning of the new age of avarice , I felt like John Reed in Moscow in 1917 . A revolution in human consumption patterns was under way , and I was on the barricades , ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insouciant Chardonnay and cappuccino . <P> Please understand that my values have always been spiritual , stressing service to others above all . But like many of my generation , I nurtured an image of the good life that was the polar opposite of how my parents spent their discretionary income in the 1950s . My taste was too elevated to tolerate frozen vegetables , supermarket ice cream , one-from-Column-A Chinese restaurants , off-the-rack clothing and clunky domestic automobiles . Yuck , how Middle American ! My refined sensibilities required only the best : fresh asparagus , Ben &; Jerry 's ice cream , Sichuan and Hunan restaurants , ventless Italian suits . But I was never one of those yuppies ; they drove BMWs . <P> That was the whole point  --  yuppies were always somebody else . Almost no one fit all the requirements of age ( young ) , income ( high ) , geography ( urban ) , attitude ( selfish ) and affectations ( Filofaxes and yellow power ties ) . Yet the fascination with charting the tastes of this subgroup was easily explainable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , " says Brad Edmondson , editor of American Demographics . " That 's also precisely where editors and TV producers live . " <P> The social history of American life since the early 1980s can be encapsulated in the ever changing images conveyed by this simple six-letter word . Watch how the meaning of yuppie shifts with the zeitgeist . <P> 1983 . A value-neutral term occasionally popping up in print as a successor to preppie . <P> 1984 . The takeoff year . It started as a political buzz word to describe the followers of Gary Hart and ended up as a catchall label for the Doonesbury generation . <P> 1985 . Now uttered with a slight sneer . Slowly , it starts to be used as an adjective modifying the noun greed . <P> 1986 . The first recorded use of the phrase " death of the yuppie . " In hindsight , this can be seen as wish fulfillment . <P> 1987 . After the stock-market crash , the press plays taps . The Wall Street Journal declares , " Yuppies have become a bore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " <P> 1988 . A consensus that the flashy life-style is doomed by the old-money values of President-elect George Bush . <P> 1989 . The fading finances of corporate raiders herald the bonfire of yuppie vanities.
