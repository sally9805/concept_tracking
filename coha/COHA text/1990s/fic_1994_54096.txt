The last deportations from the town in Poland where my father had been born , and where his parents lived , were carried out in October 1942 . The town was declared Judenrein . This word was written in the center of the green ruled page that my father found when he returned to Poland after the war . It was the only German word in the book . There was a date : 21.6.42 . A fourteen-page list of names , addresses , and ages preceded this date . The last name was Tadeusz Mitwocz . My father had returned to Poland to look for his parents . Their names were on the eleventh page . <p> In 1942 my father lived in New York . He had met my mother there , in a bookstore where she worked most evenings . That was 1933 . The owner of the bookstore allocated only so many dollars a month to heating ; when that was spent , he turned it off . My father was attracted to the long black stockings my mother wore , which were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white of her exposed wrists and slim neck . He sat on a footstool in his coat and hat to read what he could not afford to buy . He lied to her about where he lived , because he did not want to explain why he walked past the warm library to get to this cold bookstore . " How 's your friend Towshtoy today ? " she would ask him , mimicking the accent that I never heard . He had meticulously eliminated all trace of it by the time I was old enough to recognize foreign English . She stole books for him sometimes . She was from Chicago . She had seen Jews , and waited on them , but never known one . And he was nearly ten years older than she . But they were married in January 1934 . That November I was born . In 1942 they separated , and my mother moved back to Chicago , taking me with her . Despite a freeze order on civilian passenger service , my father had the means to allow me to ride the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I traveled with a woman named Constance Martin , whom my mother had found in the newspaper . She stayed with her brother and his family in Queens over the long weekends I spent with my father . To my parents she referred to herself as a " governess , " but to me she claimed to be a " travel partner , " though she slept through as many as twelve of the fifteen hours we spent on the train . We rode the New York Central 's Pacemaker , an all-coach liner , so that Mrs. Martin had to accommodate herself in the tall-backed , red upholstered banquette , despite the fact , she said , that my father could certainly afford a Pullman berth for us on the Lake Shore Limited . She said , " I do n't blame your poor mother . But look at me . I 'm light-headed . The blood pools in my bottom from sitting up at night . You wait until you 're my age . " <p> She repeated these same words every trip , in her floating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She spoke with her head turned partway between myself on the banquette beside her and the people facing us opposite . She kept her eyes on the window but did not seem to see through it . She said , " Such an important Jewish man  --  your father . One should think he might spare some of those means on his family . " <p> While she slept I walked between the cars that were full of men in uniform . The trains became crowded again during the war , and sometimes there was an antique wooden coach filling out the middle of the line . These had stained glass windows and a hopper in the bathroom  --  you could see the tracks skimming by . It was hard to imagine the quiet yards where these cars had sat quiet for so long . <p> We left the La Salle Street Station at 5:20 and traveled to New York primarily through the dark , especially in winter . The windows became black and empty between Gary and Toledo , and again between Toledo and Cleveland , where the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day coaches were full of sleeping bodies . Sometimes the quiet made them seem empty . There were children my age who sat still and awake beside their parents . We stared at each other . The lounge car startled me with its loud busyness and laughter . I never lingered there . I kept my eyes on the carpet . At the front of the train , the baggage car came directly behind the engine , " So you-all do n't hit first in case a crash , " the porter told me . He was fat . He guarded the door . No one was allowed in the baggage car , but when I stood still before him long enough he asked if I wanted a peek . There were only four windows inside . The moon lit four pools of gray and in these pools the full rows of tiered shelving formed vague , bulky shapes . The porter took the flashlight from his belt . He pointed it across a row of green duffel bags and green numbered trunks , interspersed by a stray blue or beige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter said . " No bones this trip , but a whole lot of fresh bodies " I looked for my suitcase but did not see it . <p> Each time , my father sent a different woman to pick me up at Grand Central . I learned to identify them before they approached : overdressed women with dramatic hats and pained expressions , lackadaisically searching the passengers along the ramp , hanging back behind the crowd , smiling late when they recognized my father in me . Mrs. Martin relinquished me to them unwillingly . But I looked forward to their smells , and their hats , and their sheer-stockinged legs crossed at the knee in the cab . I liked the way they looked beside my taller , older father and his black hat . I could n't feel threatened by their jealous attempts to horde his attention because I had known him long enough to understand that neither of us had a chance . I wanted to warn these women sometimes  --  when they were good to me  --  but I did n't know how . Sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform . I wondered what had happened to the last . <p> All day Saturday , and also on Monday , I tagged along with these girlfriends of his  --  shopping , visiting other bored and lovely women , waiting in the finest apartments in the city for the return of busy men , or sometimes , though not as often as expected , for their soldiers . I accompanied them to salons and dress shops and the offices of various doctors . I was surprised by the time required to maintain their casual , elegant appearances . Sometimes the cabs we rode would pass through Union Square into the neighborhood where my mother had lived when she came to the city . We never traveled on the piece of 16th Street where her apartment was because the block dead-ended into Stuyvesant Square : a seminary and the little park . But I knew when we were dose and I was able to remove myself from the cab and from the insubstantial woman beside me . My mother and I alone knew about this place , I thought  --  even my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , we might end up at the Club 18 on 52nd Street , where my father would hug me and laugh and dote . At our dark table in the buzzing room , with the fat jazz singer closing her eyes around the words and sleep taking me further from the conversation , I watched my father with these women , and with the well-dressed , younger men at our table . I felt that he was a person to be admired . He was a Bergsonite . They wanted to rescue the Jews , get them to Palestine . My father was going to make the British bomb the railroads in Poland . Those were different trains . We sat with other Bergsonites , and I listened alternately to their conversation and to the conversation of the women , who knew about the sad lives of the jazz singers we saw . Sometimes I closed my eyes . The woman with my father would say , " Your boy just turned out the lights , Josh . We should have got a sitter . " <p> " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but keep my eyes closed . <p> The woman said , " Oh no ? Well , then maybe he 's dead . " <p> " It could be , " my father said . " He 's an old man . It will happen . " <p> My smile would grow . She said , " But what if he 's only drunk ? We 'd bury him alive , doctor . " And he said , " We must tickle him , nurse . It 's the only way to be sure . " Then I would laugh and open my eyes . She would sit with her arm wrapped through his , her cheek against his shoulder . She would smile knowingly , reservedly . A thin smile . <p> Sunday afternoons my father spent alone with me  --  we walked in the park in any weather . He did n't mind if we got wet . He bought me strange trinkets at the museum gift shops : a pocket viewer with a photo of the city skyline , a gyroscope . I never knew what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklace with a small gold star after I moved to Chicago . I did n't like the way it felt around my neck , but my mother made me wear it when I visited . She had cried when I showed it to her . <p> In 1944 I turned ten , and as promised , I was allowed to make the train trip alone . My mother and I did not speak about it . She had given me the ticket and I kept it in my dresser drawer beneath my socks . But that Thursday , during breakfast , she ran through a list of questions : What do I do if a stranger bothers me ? Who do I talk to if I do n't feel well ? What if I do n't see my father at the station ? She was surprised at how well I knew my answers , as if she assumed that I had been asleep along with Mrs. Martin . She sat on my bed beside my suitcase while I packed and she made suggestions , but not many . She let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she stepped back and looked at me , up and down , twirling her finger as if stirring ice in a glass . I turned around for her . It was a dark-green wool suit she had bought for my birthday . I liked the deep trouser pockets . My mother smiled when I was facing her again . She kissed her fingertips and opened them between us . " So old , " she said . " You take care . I do n't want any recruiter trying to sign my boy up just yet . " <p> She left work early and met me at our apartment after school . Together we walked the seven long blocks to the station . The busy sidewalk by our building had been shoveled and trampled clear , but on South Clark Street it was reduced to a thin , icy path through the foot of snow on the ground . The sky threatened to dump more . At the station we had sandwiches from the vendor and I explained the difference between a trestle and a bridge to her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . I would return on Sunday , Christmas Eve , and my mother said we would have to rush to Union Station to catch the last commuter rail south to my grandmother 's house . She said , " I do n't suppose there are belated Chanukah plans on your father 's end this year ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I told her , though we had not celebrated Chanukah since I was five . <p> She nodded . " Does your father ever talk to you about God ? " she asked . She never shied away from a question . It was a practice that had cost her some friends . But I liked it  --  I wanted to be asked difficult questions . <p> Lately , though , my father 's letters had been brief and embarrassingly simple , as if I were still eight years old . Phone calls were strictly utilitarian and limited to three minutes . " No " I told her . " He does n't . " <p> She nodded again . She said , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married he lost his faith . You two have never talked about this ? " <p> Then we heard the whistle and the train came into the station . " No , " I told my mother , but she was looking at the train and did n't hear me . We counted cars : eleven day coaches , one Pullman ( " For the trainmen " I said , though I was only guessing ) , a diner , and the baggage car . My ticket was for the third car back , one of those going all the way to New York . I thought my mother would continue our conversation , but she stood up from the bench and hugged me and we kissed . " Be good " she said . When I found my seat I waved to her through the pattern of frost on the window . She threw back a kiss . Then she turned and followed the passengers from New York streaming out of the station , which surprised me . I knew it would be half an hour or more before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait on the bench , watching . I thought that I would be the one going away . She should be standing still . <p> It had begun to snow in the city when we pulled out , and it fell in slanted sheets between the rows of lit-up houses in Hammond . There was a soldier beside me in my berth . He was tall , as tall as my father . He was either nervous or excited  --  he could n't sit still . Over and over he began to whistle the same tune , then cut himself off . It seemed to me that the old man and woman who shared the banquette across from us made him nervous . The woman had wide , thick-framed glasses that swallowed her eyes , but she seemed to stare alternately at the soldier and myself . I could not be sure , though . Whenever I dared to steal a glance , her gaze was directed absently at the wall between the two of us . <p> The old man 's glasses made his eyes bug out , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He breathed with his nose and his mouth at once  --  long breaths that sometimes ended in a wet cough and a labored swallow . He looked afraid . His shoulders sloped down into his chest , as if he were falling . I thought the woman should have been attentive to his cough , comforting him , and it seemed to me that the soldier thought the same thing . <p> Finally , in the midst of one of the man 's coughing fits , the soldier sprang to his feet , startling me , and fled down the aisle . While I was gathering up the courage to follow him , the old woman said to me , " Are you traveling alone ? " There was a note of disapproval in her voice , the phrasing of a teacher , so that I felt I had to sit still and answer . <p> I said , " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " What 's your name ? " she asked , almost before I had answered . <p> " Stanley , ma'am . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be more than twelve . " <p> The man beside her began a long gravelly cough . I waited for him to finish , trying to match the unwavering stare of the woman but unable to keep my eyes from the man . He held a handkerchief to his lips with both hands , and his wrists were corrugated with blue veins . The woman 's stare was impatient . <p> Finally I said , " Ten years old . " <p> " Well . Not so old . Have you been to New York before , Stanley ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . " My father lives there , ma'am . " <p> " I see . Is your father a Jew , Stanley ? " <p> I hesitated . Then I said , " Yes . " <p> " He is . " It was part question , part statement . " And your mother ? He left her ? " she asked . <p> I said , " No . My mother left him , " though I did n't know if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said again . " Sometimes little boys get adult things wrong , though . Do n't they , Stanley ? Your parents got out before Hitler , I suppose . Is that right ? Maybe you 're not sure . " <p> I said , " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " Well , good for them , " she said . " God bless them . " <p> The man beside her leaned farther forward , then swung slowly into a standing position . He began to shuffle between the woman and myself . She sat back out of his way , watched him pass . I said , " I have to go to the john . " When the woman nodded , approving , I stood and followed the man . <p> I parted from him at the bathroom , where I locked the door behind myself and turned around to the sink . I washed my face , then lingered over my reflection in the mirror . My skin was pale against the dark green of my coat and the gold of my necklace . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarmulke , like some boys I had known in New York . For two years now I had been living with my mother , who was not Jewish . My father talked about the Jews , but he did not seem to act like one . I was becoming less and less Jewish . By the time I was an adult , I would be a Christian , like my mother . <p> In the bathroom was a tiny square window with a translucent pane of glass that could be slid open . If I stood on the toilet , I could just fit my head through the window . Outside the cold and the loud rhythm of the engine and the whine of the wheels were like the elements of another world . It was snowing  --  the snow fell across my face and into my eyes . The fields we cut through were dark and empty beneath the snow , with an irrigation ditch running close along the raised tracks . The blare of the train whistle startled me . We passed through an intersection where the bells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . <p> I walked through the train without seeing my soldier . Here and there were groups of men playing cards . In the coaches the groups were small and quiet , sometimes silent , but in the lounge car there was one large circle of men who were arguing and laughing at the same time . I went to the observation car at the back of the train . It had a rounded end full of windows where you could watch the tracks receding , and a glass ceiling as well . On clear nights all the stars were visible , but tonight it was just black . I could only see the snow falling through the shine of occasional street lamps . The streets were mostly empty . If I watched the track without taking my eyes from it , eventually it seemed as if it were moving , and the earth was spinning away from us . There was the loud clack and jerk when we crossed a switch point , then the other track would bend into or away from us . <p> When I returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded in her lap . The man had been looking out the window . He turned his scared eyes to me , then back to the window again . The soldier was still gone . I sat and watched the landscape go by , but this was the straight , empty stretch of track across the top of Ohio . I closed my eyes . The track was so straight here that the rock of the train between the rails became a slow , gentle drift . I listened to the man 's large breaths . Soon I fell asleep . Outside the window the fields were white , but they slid away . The moon loomed large along the shoulder of a hill  --  it was bright in the empty snowfields . In the shadows . I heard the train whistle . <p> I was being shaken , a hand on my shoulder , and when I opened my eyes the soldier was there . " Psst , " he said , jerking his chin toward the aisle in a " follow me " gesture . I was quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be sleeping . But when I stood to follow I saw that the old man was awake and staring at me . I thought he might ask if he could come with us , but he did n't . He looked sad . He breathed as if it occupied his attention and his stare slipped down off of me . <p> I followed the soldier to the end of the car . He was tall , with the clipped black hair and a rolled cap hanging out of his pocket . He held open the door between cars and said , " You want to do me a favor , kid ? " <p> He followed me now , with a hand on my back . He said , " I hope you were n't asleep . " I shook my head no . He nodded . " Who could sleep in the sick berth back there ? " He led me through the diner to the lounge car . " What 's your name , anyway ? " <p> " Stanley , " I told him . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , though I had n't . <p> " Good . You 're not playing tonight but we need a banker over here . Our last banker had to go with his pop . You think you could be a banker ? " <p> I nodded again . <p> " Where 's your pop , Stan ? " <p> " In New York , " I said as we approached a table where four other men , all soldiers in identical uniforms , were sitting and laughing . My soldier stood behind me with his hands on my shoulders . He said , " Gentlemen , " while they were still laughing . One by one , the four men turned to look at me . " Meet Stan the banker , " he said . <p> The fat man across the table sat back so far in his chair that he seemed about to fall . He said , " A Jew , I guess . Leave it to Nate to find us a Jew banker . " <p> There was laughter , and I blushed , while from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , Stan here is traveling alone . His old man 's in New York . " <p> " You a New Yorker ? " one of the men asked . He wore glasses , and the lamp on the wall behind me covered them over in a reflected yellow glaze . I said , " Yes . " <p> " That 's good enough for me , " he said . " Sit him down . " <p> Nate brought me a Roy Rogers , which was what my father got me when we went to bars in New York . The man in glasses had a heap of bills separated into five dipped piles , each pile with a slip of paper on which a set of initials were written . He stacked the dipped piles into a single wad and rolled it into a green circle . He put a rubber band around that . Then he turned to me and stared for a moment , waiting , before he said , " Give me your hand , Stanley . " Nate sat just on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat man . I put my hand onto the table . The man in glasses took it into his hand . He put the money into my palm , then closed his two hands tight around mine . He stared at me again while he held my hand up between us , full of the money and enclosed in his own . He said , " Take this and put it into your underwear . You make sure it wo n't fall out . And you do n't give anything to anybody unless I tell you to . All clear ? " <p> He let go of my hand , but I sat still . Nate was still talking , gesturing toward the bar and laughing . I was alone with this man . He said , " In your underwear , Stanley . " He motioned , holding his belt with one hand and pointing down along his belly with the other . " No joke . " <p> I stood up . He put his hand around my arm , startling me . " Where you going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . <p> " No , no , no , no . " He shook his head and held my arm , tightly . He said , " Loosen your belt . Go ahead . Here , put the money down for a minute . Now loosen your belt . Top button . There . In the underwear . Nobody 's looking , Stanley , do n't be shy . " I did what he said . When I had buttoned my pants again he said , " Jump for me . Jump up and down for me . " <p> I did . " It 's not falling out ? " he asked . I shook my head . When I had jumped , the money had settled into a lump at the bottom of my underwear , between my legs . It felt large and clumsy . I had to keep my legs spread slightly . <p> The man in glasses turned to the others and said , " Let 's get going here . " To me he said , " Sit down , Stanley . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew from the tone of his voice that he could tell I was scared . But I did n't want him to speak sympathetically , or to apologize , because then I would cry . He said , " Relax now . You 're a born banker . " <p> Soon I did relax . Nate showed me his cards . I did n't know anything about the game , but I matched his facial expressions  --  pleased or not  --  and we pretended that I was helping . Sometimes he won on the hands that we had frowned at . They played with wooden chips . When the fat man wanted to leave , I had to take the damp , soft bills from my pants . The man in the glasses told me his initials and I found his bundle . Some of the money was returned to the fat man . The rest went back in my pants . <p> Then I watched them forget about me , something I was used to among adults , particularly in bars . The game became serious and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses lost when the cards were shown . He swore and slammed his fist against the table . Then he was quiet , smoking , while the others talked between hands . I was not the only one who tried to ignore him . They talked about women and about women 's names and about the places where these women lived . I became sleepy , but I did not intend to disappoint Nate as the banker before me apparently had . The train rocked beneath us , and I had the feeling that we were the only ones left awake apart from the engineer . Another man wanted to leave the game . " Cash him out , " the man in glasses said to me . He told me the initials , then said , " Plus fifty-one . " I did n't understand . Finally he took the money from me , annoyed , and paid the man . He said to me , " You short time this country ? No learn math ? " <p> I did n't answer . Nate shook the ice in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man gave me back the remaining bills . " Tuck ' em away , " he said , and I thought he was done with me . But then he asked , " How old are you ? " <p> " Ten , " I said . <p> " Ten . Where the hell are your parents ? Ten . " <p> I did n't know if he wanted an answer . I began , " My father 's . . . " <p> " Your father 's in New York . Where 's your mother ? " <p> " Chicago . " <p> " She a Jew ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Ah , " he said , nodding , wagging a single finger . " Right . Yes . Now I understand . " I did n't know what he meant but I thought that I should , that it was something obvious . When the cards were dealt , the players became silent . In the middle of the hand , Nate asked me , " What does your old man do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I had never learned how to answer . But since these men were soldiers , I thought they would understand if I told the truth . So I said , " He 's making the British bomb the railroads in Poland . " <p> " He 's what ? " the man in glasses asked . <p> " Is he in the service ? " Nate asked . <p> I said , " No . He 's a Bergsonite . " <p> " He 's a what ? " The man in glasses began to laugh , which surprised me . <p> Another man said , " There 's not many kids your age with a father around to visit these days . " And the last man asked , " Are we playing cards here or what ? " <p> But the man in glasses was still laughing . " A Bergsonite , " he said , staring at me incredulously . " Is that some kind of secret Jew cult ? " He leaned heavily into the table and held a hand out toward Nate , palm up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nate shrugged . He said , " Let 's play cards . " <p> " A Bergsonite , " the man said again , mimicking me . He laughed . <p> Later , when the game was over and I had returned to my berth and found some sleep , in the morning , in New York , the old man spoke to me in a quiet voice that was neither ghostly nor rasping , that I could not place with his menacing cough . He told me he had been in the old Grand Central in ' 88 , during the storm . This was before they had switched to electric in the city . They fed the trains coal while they sat idle at the ramps . The steam warmed the building , and people came there from their frozen homes . " We slept over , " the man said . " We could n't get out . I 'm seventy-four years old but I was a boy your age then .

I tried very hard to avoid my father and his new wife at that time , but it was not always possible . They had two children  --  a girl and then a boy . My father said , " You were always your mother 's child . I ca n't claim you . " Later he said , " If your mother never left we would be happily married still . " He died in 1964 .
