When a polluter hollers , Dan Quayle calls a meeting . Then they closse the door . <p> Despite having been an irregular heartbeat away from the presidency , Vice-PresidentJ . Danforth Quayle is still seen by most Americans as a harmless lightweight more interested in his golf game than in the business of government . <p> They 're wrong about the harmless part . For the past year Quayle has served as the patron saint of American corporations unhappy with the cost and bother of environmental regulation . As chair of the President 's Council on Competitiveness , Quayle hands polluters **26;225;TOOLONG cards by changing the rules after environmental legislation has been made law . According to Representative Henry Waxman ( D-Calif. ) , chair of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment , " While Mr. Bush cultivates the image of the environmental president . his vice-president is part of a shadow government that works behind the scenes to help polluting industries undermine the law . " <p> It 's a dirty job , but Republican vice-presidents have had to do it ever since Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House the power to vet federal regulations for their effect on industrial " competitiveness . " Then-veep George Bush chaired the Task Force on Regulatory Relief , which boasted among its achievements slowing the phase-out of lead from gasoline . <p> The same work is now carried on by the Council on Competitiveness , which counts among its permanent members the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce , the Attorney General , Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman , and the bane of environmental regulators everywhere , Chief of Staff John Sununu . The council 's closed meetings provide a convivial working atmosphere , free from annoying oversight . While the OMB is prohibited from direct contacts with industry , the Council on Competitiveness suffers no such strictures , making it a pipeline into the federal regulatory apparatus for corporate interests . Here are some of its proudest accomplishments : Last December , the council ordered the EPA to drop its proposed ban on the incineration of lead batteries , the source of 60 percent of the lead in U. S. garbage . With incinerated lead directly contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lead in their blood , the ban might seem a reasonable precaution . Quayle 's council , however , found it " did not meet the benefit/cost requirements for regulatory policy . " ( Although the council talks a lot about cost/benefit analyses , it never furnishes the data on which they are based . ) The council killed a regulation that would have required cities with garbage incinerators to recycle a quarter of their trash  --  even though the White House had once touted the rule as the solution to the nation 's solid-waste woes . While the EPA had previously declared that the regulation " would pass any imaginable cost/benefit test , " the incinerator industry found it burdensome , and so did the Council on Competitiveness . At present , if a biotechnology company wants to develop a woodpecker-proof tree or a submarine-size catfish , it has to get USDA approval . But the council thinks that new , genetically engineered life forms should be as unregulated as those derived from conventional breeding . Under its proposed guidelines , only organisms that industry executives themselves admit are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hundred changes to the Clean Air Act of 1990 , none of which would strengthen it . Most damaging , perhaps , is a proposed loophole ( couched as a " minor permit amendment " ) that would allow companies to set their own maximum pollution levels . Should state governments fail to object to a company 's dream limits within seven days , the permit would automatically be revised to suit the polluter 's fancy . <p> " Not only is this horrible policy , it is also flagrantly illegal , " complains Waxman . Had the president wanted to veto the Clean Air Act , the congressman suggests , he should have done so . " But , once enacted into law , he does not have authority to revise or alter the legislation . Nor , needless to say , does his vice-president . " <p> In its efforts " to eliminate government-imposed burdens on scientific and technological progress " and to " protect private-property rights from unwarranted government interference , " the council has made itself a final court of appeal for polluters . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions have gone largely unnoticed . ( When they are noted , it is generally as evidence that at least Quayle is doing something . ) After an industry 's arguments have been rejected by Congress , the president , and the EPA , they can still find a sympathetic hearing in what Sierra Club Washington lobbyist Dan Weiss calls " the death chamber for tough environmental regulations . " While he may never get to be chief executive , at least Dan Quayle can serve as chief <p>
