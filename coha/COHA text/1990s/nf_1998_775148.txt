The Wisdom of Repugnance Leon R. Kass // Our habit of delighting in news of scientific and technological breakthroughs has been sorely challenged by the birth announcement of a sheep named Dolly . Though Dolly shares with previous sheep the " softest clothing , woolly , bright , " William Blake 's question , " Little Lamb , who made thee ? " has for her a radically different answer : Dolly was , quite literally , made . She is the work not of nature or nature 's God but of man , an Englishman , Ian Wilmut , and his fellow scientists . What is more , Dolly came into being not only asexually  --  ironically , just like " He who calls Himself a Lamb "  --  but also as the genetically identical copy ( and the perfect incarnation of the form or blueprint ) of a mature ewe , of whom she is a clone . This long-awaited yet not quite expected success in cloning a mammal raised immediately the prospect  --  and the specter  --  of cloning human beings : " I a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have always been equal candidates for creative making , only now , by means of cloning , we may both spring from the hand of man playing at being God . // After an initial flurry of expert comment and public consternation , with opinion polls showing overwhelming opposition to cloning human beings , President Clinton ordered a ban on all federal support for human cloning research ( even though none was being supported ) and charged the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to report in ninety days on the ethics of human cloning research . The commission ( an eighteen-member panel , evenly balanced between scientists and nonscientists , appointed by the president and reporting to the National Science and Technology Council ) invited testimony from scientists , religious thinkers , and bioethicists , as well as from the general public . In its report , issued in June 1997 , the commission concluded that attempting to clone a human being was " at this time ... morally unacceptable , " recommended continuing the president 's moratorium on the use of federal funds to support cloning of humans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the next three to five years ) to create a child through cloning . // Even before the commission reported , Congress was poised to act . Bills to prohibit the use of federal funds for human cloning research have been introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate ; and another bill , in the House , would make it illegal " for any person to use a human somatic cell for the process of producing a human clone . " A fateful decision is at hand . To clone or not to clone a human being is no longer an academic question . Taking Cloning Seriously , Then and Now // Cloning first came to public attention roughly thirty years ago , following the successful asexual production , in England , of a clutch of tadpole clones by the technique of nuclear transplantation . The individual largely responsible for bringing the prospect and promise of human cloning to public notice was Joshua Lederberg , a Nobel laureate geneticist and a man of large vision . In 1966 Lederberg wrote a remarkable article in the American Naturalist detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic engineering , and the following year he devoted a column in the Washington Post , where he wrote regularly on science and society , to the prospect of human cloning . He suggested that cloning could help us overcome the unpredictable variety that still rules human reproduction and would allow us to benefit from perpetuating superior genetic endowments . Those writings sparked a small public debate in which I became a participant . At the time a young researcher in molecular biology at the National Institutes of Health , I wrote a reply to the Post , arguing against Lederberg 's amoral treatment of that morally weighty subject and insisting on the urgency of confronting a series of questions and objections , culminating in the suggestion that " the programmed reproduction of man will , in fact , dehumanize him . " // Much has happened in the intervening years . It has become harder , not easier , to discern the true meaning of human cloning . We have in some sense been softened up to the idea  --  through movies , cartoons , jokes , and intermittent commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have become accustomed to new practices in human reproduction : not just in vitro fertilization , but also embryo manipulation , embryo donation , and surrogate pregnancy . Animal biotechnology has yielded transgenic animals and a burgeoning science of genetic engineering , easily and soon to be transferable to humans . // Even more important , changes in the broader culture make it now vastly more difficult to express a common and respectful understanding of sexuality , procreation , nascent life , family , and the meaning of motherhood , fatherhood , and the links between the generations . Twenty-five years ago , abortion was still largely illegal and thought to be immoral , the sexual revolution ( made possible by the extramarital use of the pill ) was still in its infancy , and few had yet heard about the reproductive rights of single women , homosexual men , and lesbians . ( Never mind shameless memoirs about one 's own incest ! ) Then one could argue , without embarrassment , that the new technologies of human reproduction  --  babies without sex  --  and their confounding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg donor , the surrogate who carries and delivers , or the one who rears ?  --  would " undermine the justification and support that biological parenthood gives to the monogamous marriage . " Today , defenders of stable , monogamous marriage risk charges of giving offense to those adults who are living in " new family forms " or to those children who , even without the benefit of assisted reproduction , have acquired either three or four parents or one or none at all . Today , one must even apologize for voicing opinions that twenty-five years ago were nearly universally regarded as the core of our culture 's wisdom on those matters . In a world whose once-given natural boundaries are blurred by technological change and whose moral boundaries are seemingly up for grabs , it is much more difficult to make persuasive the still compelling case against cloning human beings . As Raskolnikov put it , " Man gets used to everything  --  the beast ! " // Indeed , perhaps the most depressing feature of the discussions that immediately followed the news about Dolly was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " An Udder Way of Making Lambs " ( Nature ) , " Who Will Cash in on Breakthrough in Cloning ? " ( Wall Street Journal ) , " Is Cloning Baaaaaaaad ? " ( Chicago Tribune ) . Gone from the scene are the wise and courageous voices of Theodosius Dobzhansky ( genetics ) , Hans Jonas ( philosophy ) , and Paul Ramsey ( theology ) , who , only twenty-five years ago , all made powerful moral arguments against ever cloning a human being . We are now too sophisticated for such argumentation ; we would not be caught in public with a strong moral stance , never mind an absolutist one . We are all , or almost all , postmodernists now . // Cloning turns out to be the perfect embodiment of the ruling opinions of our new age . Thanks to the sexual revolution , we are able to deny in practice , and increasingly in thought , the inherent procreative teleology of sexuality itself . But , if sex has no intrinsic connection to generating babies , babies need have no necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights movement , we are increasingly encouraged to treat the natural heterosexual difference and its preeminence as a matter of " cultural construction . " But if male and female are not normatively complementary and generatively significant , babies need not come from male and female complementarity . Thanks to the prominence and the acceptability of divorce and out-of-wedlock births , stable , monogamous marriage as the ideal home for procreation is no longer the agreed-upon cultural norm . For that new dispensation , the clone is the ideal emblem : the ultimate " single-parent child . " // Thanks to our belief that all children should be wanted children ( the more high-minded principle we use to justify contraception and abortion ) , sooner or later only those children who fulfill our wants will be fully acceptable . Through cloning , we can work our wants and wills on the very identity of our children , exercising control as never before . Thanks to modern notions of individualism and the rate of cultural change , we see ourselves not as linked to ancestors and defined by traditions , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men but also man-made selves ; and self-cloning is simply an extension of such rootless and narcissistic self-re-creation. // Unwilling to acknowledge our debt to the past and unwilling to embrace the uncertainties and the limitations of the future , we have a false relation to both : cloning personifies our desire fully to control the future , while being subject to no controls ourselves . Enchanted and enslaved by the glamour of technology , we have lost our awe and wonder before the deep mysteries of nature and of life . We cheerfully take our own beginnings in our hands and , like the last man , we blink . // Part of the blame for our complacency lies , sadly , with the field of bioethics itself , and its claim to expertise in these moral matters . Bioethics was founded by people who understood that the new biology touched and threatened the deepest matters of our humanity : bodily integrity , identity and individuality , lineage and kinship , freedom and self-command , eros and aspiration , and the relations and strivings of body and soul . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable routinization and professionalization , the field has by and large come to content itself with analyzing moral arguments , reacting to new technological developments , and taking on emerging issues of public policy , all performed with a naive faith that the evils we fear can all be avoided by compassion , regulation , and a respect for autonomy . Bioethics has made some major contributions in the protection of human subjects and in other areas where personal freedom is threatened ; but its practitioners , with few exceptions , have turned the big human questions into pretty thin gruel. // One reason for that is that the piecemeal formation of public policy tends to grind down large questions of morals into small questions of procedure . Many of the country 's leading bioethicists have served on national commissions or state task forces and advisory boards , where , understandably , they have found utilitarianism to be the only ethical vocabulary acceptable to all participants in discussing issues of law , regulation , and public policy . As many of those commissions have been either officially under the aegis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Department , or otherwise dominated by powerful voices for scientific progress , the ethicists have for the most part been content , after some " values clarification " and wringing of hands , to pronounce their blessings upon the inevitable . Indeed , it is the bioethicists , not the scientists , who are now the most articulate defenders of human cloning : the two witnesses testifying before the National Bioethics Advisory Commission in favor of cloning human beings were bioethicists , eager to rebut what they regard as the irrational concerns of those of us in opposition . We have come to expect from the " experts " an accommodationist ethic that will rubber-stamp all biomedical innovation , in the mistaken belief that all other goods must bow down to the gods of better health and scientific advance . Regrettably , as we shall see near the end of this essay , the report of the present commission , though better than its predecessors , is finally not an exception . // If we are to correct our moral myopia , we must first of all persuade ourselves not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human cloning , though it is in some respects continuous with previous reproductive technologies , also represents something radically new , in itself and in its easily foreseeable consequences . The stakes are very high indeed . I exaggerate , but in the direction of the truth , when I insist that we are faced with having to decide nothing less than whether human procreation is going to remain human , whether children are going to be made rather than begotten , whether it is a good thing , humanly speaking , to say yes in principle to the road that leads ( at best ) to the dehumanized rationality of Brave New World . This is not business as usual , to be fretted about for a while but finally to be given our seal of approval . We must rise to the occasion and make our judgments as if the future of our humanity hangs in the balance . For so it does . // CHAPTER ONE CONTINUES ...
