When I was twelve years old , I accidentally found out about my defect . For quite a while , I had had an inkling that there was something odd about me , but up until then , I had n't realized that such a disastrous defect as mine even existed . <p> Until then , I had associated my peculiarity with my mother . My mother was an artist who had personality . She said so herself . Obviously both of these attributes set her apart from the other mothers in the courtyard of our building . <p> She had painted every floor in our small apartment red . We had a living room where she slept and a small , adjoining room where my little brother and I slept in bunk beds . In addition , the apartment had a kitchen and a toilet . The caretaker saw the red floors once and told my mother she would regret it since she would have to pay reimbursement if she ever moved . But my mother did n't care and said that not only was the caretaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were artistic . In addition , she had put up paintings throughout the apartment , even in the john . Up near the ceiling . Another artistic touch . If you wanted to see what was in the paintings , you had to climb a ladder . Beneath them , the walls were completely bare . <p> My mother never closed the curtains . Often someone would peep from the windows on the opposite side of the courtyard . The curtains would move ever so slightly . My mother always embarrassed me . She was very proud of her body , and when she did n't happen to be lying in bed  --  her favorite pastime  --  she was running around half-naked . Which of course explained why the curtains were almost always moving across the way . She would never really get dressed until evening . She was almost totally undressed even when she pulled in clothes from the clothesline outside our window . Sometimes , one of her breasts would slip out of her undershirt while she stood there pulling on the squeaky line . Squeaky because we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid through . If anybody ever stared openly at her , she just waved . She had nothing to hide . " All they 're staring at , you know , is what God gave me , " was her usual reply . <p> I would much rather have had a mother like Gurli 's . Her mother sat in her apartment looking out the window all day long , keeping her eye on who was playing in the courtyard . And she was always dressed . <p> " Go back and play in your own courtyard , " she shouted down every once in a while , " Petra does n't want to play with you . " Even though I might have been having fun with Lonnie , a girl from a neighboring courtyard . Gurli 's mother made sure that only children from the same courtyard played together . She invariably annoyed us by chasing off someone from another courtyard just when we were having fun . But I would have preferred her to a mother like mine . <p> Sometimes the other children teased me and shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Petra 's mother 's a whore ! " <p> I did n't know what a whore was . I could tell from their laughter and the looks on their faces that it meant something shameless and naughty , yet I assumed they said it because of her public displays of nudity from our window . I would never go down to play after they chanted like that but remained up in our apartment . Much to my mother 's chagrin . <p> " What are you hanging around here for ? " she would ask . " You 're getting on my nerves . Go out and play . " <p> One time I told her what they had said . All I got out of that was an angry slap in the face and a scolding : " You 'll never have any personality if you go around listening to their gossip . They 're just a bunch of envious snobs . " <p> My mother 's douche hung in the kitchen . She had told me what it was called , but she refused to tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " You 've got enough time to learn about the dark secrets of life , " which sounded ominous . The dark secrets of life . As if the plight of an adult was worse than a child 's . And that was hard for me to understand . The douche was made of thick white pipe and some red rubber hoses . A rather depressing contraption , reminding me of a hospital . The device must have had something to do with whatever it was my mother did at night since I was often wakened by the sounds of her rattling it under running water from the kitchen . I always knew I must have been asleep for a long time and that it must have been very late at night if she was home . Just to be on the safe side , I would double check to make sure everything was as it should be : my flashlight under my pillow , no Reader 's Digest in bed with me , and the ceiling light turned out . Then I could go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I can remember from my experience there was that my mother had given me a quart of strawberries . And since she did n't tell me I could eat them , I did n't dare . Every day the strawberries got moldier . By her next visit , they looked like small downy ducklings . She said that if I had n't been bedridden , she would have hit me out of sheer contempt for my stupidity . My defect had already existed back then . Yes , long before . What a stupid , ignorant fool I had been , lying there at the hospital . <p> My mother 's hand was almost always cocked and ready . At the most unpredictable times , it could fly out and land such hard , stinging slaps that my head would ring and hours later I would still have a red welt on my cheek . One time , after I had developed an inflammation of the middle ear . I carefully hinted to her that she had caused it by hitting me . A lie , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She merely slapped me on the cheek with the healthy ear instead , after which I got the usual rigmarole about being impudent , insolent , and sassy . I never really knew the difference between impudent and insolent . Maybe I had deserved that particular slap , but nearly every other time I told her what I thought or felt . I always got the " impudent , insolent , and sassy " line . Then whack ! Right on my cheek . As a result , I gradually clammed up , and after I found out about my defect , I stopped saying anything to her at all . That was a mistake , too , of course . The fact is , I started to stare . Since I felt so much was always wrong with me , I would observe everyone else very carefully . <p> " Child , you 're staring . You must have gotten that from your father , " she would say . " You never say anything . Talk to me . " <p> Eventually , I cringed whenever she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could never be sure that her hand would n't fly out and hit me . She became annoyed with me for it , too , as if my nervous movements bothered her . <p> " Stop putting on an act , " she would say . But I was n't putting on an act at all . I cringed quite automatically . It was a useless reflex , though , because even if I managed to duck her first swing , the second one usually connected . <p> Inge lived above us . Until I found out about my defect , I was pleased not to be in her shoes . But afterwards , I was n't so sure anymore . Inge had seven brothers and sisters , and her whole family lived together in three small rooms . One of the rooms was filled entirely with beds . The smallest children slept two to a bed with their heads at opposite ends . Inge 's father drank . Because Inge was the oldest , she had to take care of the younger ones . But one Sunday she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother had even been kind enough to keep my little brother in with her . She had given us each fifty re to go on a spree with . But because I was so eager to impress Inge , I got her to keep a lookout in front of the kitchen door while I carefully climbed up onto the kitchen counter and removed two twenty-five-re pieces from the gas meter . It was n't at all necessary . Inge had been quite impressed already . By everything , both the fifty re and by the fact that we were allowed to play by ourselves without having a little kid around . But that 's just the way I was . I always managed to lie and brag and in general make myself appear much more interesting than I really was . <p> That Sunday had ended badly . Inge left to go up and eat at six o'clock and then returned again almost immediately , crying and red-faced . She had lost her hair clip while we were playing . It was n't a fancy hair clip with flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one like the kind they sold at Schou 's Drugstore , twelve for fifty re . We searched everywhere but could n't find it . Inge cried even more . Then my mother gave Inge another clip that she pulled out of her own hair . <p> " Gee , your mother sure is terrific , " said Inge and rushed up the stairs again . Unfortunately , my mother heard her say it . " There , you see ? " she said , " You 're OK here , kid . " <p> Inge and her brother and sisters got spanked every Saturday . All week long their parents made a note in a little book every time they were bad . The following Saturday morning , they would get spanked with a leather belt . I was deeply shocked when I found out . Inge had casually mentioned it one day while we were playing in the courtyard . She was taking care of her younger two sisters and one brother at the same time . While we were skipping , she bit off one of her nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means one whack on Saturday . " <p> " What do you mean ? Do you have to wait all week for it ? " I asked dumbfounded . It was only Wednesday . <p> " Why yes , " said Inge , " but usually I only get one or two , ' cause I 'm pretty careful all week long , but you should see my big brother . He gets ten whacks sometimes and does n't even cry . " <p> " Is n't it hard to wait all week ? " I continued curiously . <p> " No . You get used to it . There are eight of us , you know , and Mom gets sick a lot , so she ca n't hit us , and Dad is tired every day when he comes home from work . He would n't have time for anything else if he had to hit us every night . Sometimes he 's drunk , too , and then he ca n't hit us very well . Now they just add it all up . Mom makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spankings , we get our allowances . " <p> My mother always seemed very fat to me . On Saturdays , when we all got to take a bath , I looked at her with disgust . Before I discovered my defect , I always wondered why her nakedness was repulsive to me , since I knew it was n't normal to feel that way . It was normal to love your mother , and it was the worst thing in the world not to . Eva , who sat next to me in school , told me that whenever she started laughing during class , she would try imagining that her mother was dead . That always made her stop right away . I laughed a lot during class too , and since we were n't allowed to , I tried imagining my mother was dead too . I always kept right on laughing anyway . And never understood why . <p> We took baths in a zinc tub in the living room . The tub was placed in front of the wood-burning stove because of the heat . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , and last of all me . We all used the same water to save money . The water was heated out in the kitchen on the gas burners in a soup pot and tea kettle . My little brother would get both a pot and a kettle filled with boiling water . The rest was cold water . He was so small you almost could n't see him when he sat down on the bottom of the tub . Next it was my mother 's turn , and she would get one more kettle of boiling water . She would stand up and wash herself while my little brother and I sat on my mother 's bed . The bed was n't a real bed , but a sofa bed for two persons . It was almost always pulled out as a bed . Only when guests came was it ever changed into what it really was . But that was very rare . <p> Then my little brother would get wrapped up in a bath towel as I sat there in my underclothes , rather cold , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , almost as if she were enjoying it . She would hum all the while . I was always longing for my mother to hum because I had read somewhere that only happy people hummed . But she would only do it while she was taking a bath . <p> After she had rubbed soap and water all over her body , a strange odor emanated from her . An odor that I hated . It smelled like a mixture of rotting fish and mother . I always felt guilty that I did n't like the smell . I could never stand to look at her and instead always stared stiffly to one side picking at my toes . But my eyes would creep over to her again by themselves anyway . She was enormous . Much more so without the slip or undershirt that she usually ran around in . She had large breasts with reddish brown nipples resting on a fat stomach , and short legs with fat thighs . Whenever she bent over to put more water on her body , everything on her rippled and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speckles to appear all over her . I looked down at my own thin body . I did n't think I was particularly pretty , and my mother had always said : " One thing you 're not is beautiful . " But I liked my body a lot better than hers . I was kind of afraid that I would turn out to look like her when I grew up . Even though everyone always told me I looked like my father . But how could I be sure ? I did n't know what he looked like either . And all that disgusting body hair she had . Hair under her arms , hair on her stomach , hair between her legs . And I had come out right through those hairs between her legs . <p> When it was my turn to be washed , I would get one more kettle of boiling water . By now the zinc tub was so full that I had to sit very still . Sometimes if I jostled the water too much , it splashed over the edge . By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional kettle of boiling water . Scraps of soap bobbed around , and gray soap bubbles floated on the surface of the water . A grayish-white border of dirt made a ring around the top edge of the tub . I once asked if I could wash first . No , I could n't . I was too big for that , and besides it was impractical . Why it was impractical I never found out . <p> Being the last , I would have to dry up . My mother would drag the tub out into the kitchen with a lot of groaning and puffing . Once in a while , she spilled a large slop on the floor . I always had to follow behind her with a cloth and dry it up quickly . Whenever my mother poured the dirty water out into the kitchen sink , she groaned too . Once , to help her , I pushed on the tub . I should n't have . The water sloshed all over my mother and then down onto the floor in a big splash . She slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor and soak up the dirty water with a cloth . I sobbed the entire time . <p> What bothered me most whenever it was my turn to wash was that my mother had washed herself in the same water . I always hurried . I did n't sit there enjoying it like my little brother . That strange smell from my mother seemed to cling to the water , and I never felt really clean . I always carried a faint smell of her around on me . <p> Every other week at bath time she washed our hair . She used a white powder called Elida Golden Shampoo for Brown Hair . My hair was very light blond , my mother 's black , and my little brother 's dark brown . My mother hoped that my hair would get darker if she washed my hair with it . There was an Elida Golden Shampoo for Blond Hair too , but my mother thought that blond hair was ugly . Dark hair was attractive . <p> Whenever she washed my little brother 's hair , she shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head in a bun or sharpening it out behind like a pointed hat . Or separating it into two large ears , one on each side of his head . " Now you 're a fox , " she would say . He thoroughly enjoyed it . She never shaped the foam on my head . Moreover , I had blue eyes in contrast to both my mother and little brother , who had brown . <p> " Blue eyes ca n't be trusted , " she would say . " They lie . " <p> I would stand staring at my eyes in the bathroom mirror wondering why they lied more than brown . I was convinced that if she had found something called Elida Golden Shampoo for Brown Eyes , she would have used it . To change them . <p> After I found out about my defect , I knew I would never be like other children . It was n't only my mother . Everything about me had either been wrong or abnormal right from the beginning . After I had been born and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother cried out : <p> " Stick it back up again . I want a boy . " <p> After which she rolled over and started crying . All she had were baby clothes for a little boy ; that 's how sure she had been . Jump suits , tiny hats , and the like , and all of it powder blue . She had picked out a boy 's name too : Petrus , after an artist she greatly admired , and that was why I was named Petra . She could n't be bothered with finding another name . So I had started my life in light blue with a boy 's name . Even worse , as if that was n't bad enough , she had named my little brother Petrus , and the clothes were perfect for him . I did n't like his name , so I never called him anything but " baby brother . " I did n't like my name either . I avoided using it . Secretly I called myself Vivian . <p> My father had moved out when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had never seen him since . He remarried and had other children . Last Christmas , my father sent a present to me . <p> " You 'll have nothing to do with that , " my mother said . " Your little brother did n't even get anything . Do n't you think that 's unfair ? " <p> No , I did n't . My little brother did n't have any father at all . He had suddenly just appeared . <p> " You send that back unopened . " <p> I really wanted to see what was in the package , just to be able to see if it was anything I could use . It probably was , because I could use everything . The gift had arrived in brown postal paper . Inside , it was nicely wrapped in red paper with gold stars and a little tag : " To Petra From Daddy . " A golden bee sat on the gift too . I had looked with longing at the gift and the golden bee as it disappeared down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the golden bee . <p> " Now your father will see that you can take care of yourself without him , " my mother said . <p> She always used the expression " your father " as if I had been the one who had picked out that particular man to be my father . As if she had n't had anything to do with it at all . <p> She had written on the package in large letters : PACKAGE REFUSED . <p> And then she repeated the story one more time about what had happened when I was little . " Your father did n't like you at all . You were such a big disappointment for him . " Besides being a disappointment for her . " Your father picked you up only one single time . And you were as limp as a rag doll . So your father took some books and put them behind your back for support and gave you a cookie . But you just fell over wailing , and of course , you could n't eat the cookie . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now he 'd better not come around here sucking up to anybody . " I had heard the same story hundreds of times , in slightly different versions . Sometimes it was a piece of cake he had given me , and other times she remembered the books . They varied from Salmonsen 's Encyclopedia to the Bible . <p> When my mother was just about ready to give birth to my little brother , she sent me over to stay with a lady . They are no longer on speaking terms . But at the time the lady told me about my defect . She did n't mention anything about it being a defect . ( I found out about that later myself . ) She told me the part about the midwife and also about how my mother had always left me lying in the crib . She never picked me up to talk or cuddle with me . <p> Just fed and changed me . " I hope you realize , " said the lady giving me a rather queer look , " how awful I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whenever I visited you , but she always was callous and stubborn . She 'd just let you lie there . She was totally indifferent . " So I had been what they call a " slow learner " since I was n't potty trained and neither walked nor talked until after I was three years old . What a shame that my mother and the lady were n't on speaking terms , because I was very interested in talking to her about my defect . <p> Whenever my mother went out in the evening , she totally transformed her appearance . Put on fine clothes and lots of makeup . I did n't think she looked pretty , but I 'm sure that was her intention . Even though she applied a thick coat of lipstick , she could never rid herself of those large yellow teeth and that peculiar mouth of hers . Whenever she smiled a lot , her large mouth made her look like an animal about to strike . She did have a black dress I loved , though . It was embroidered with garlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would even promise me I could have the dress after she died . Her eyebrows would be transformed into two black lines with the help of a small brush and a can of black goo that she spit into . She put yellow powder on her face with a cotton ball . Using the contents from another can , she 'd make two red patches in the middle of her cheeks . Then the lipstick , and finally the perfume . It was nauseatingly sweet , but better than the smell of mother . She would use so much of it that sometimes a little cloud of it surrounded her . Even long after she left , I could smell it when I 'd sneak into the living room to get books . She wore black nylons with black seams . The seams had to be perfectly straight . She would make me get down on my knees and check them . She insisted that only sloppy girls went around with crooked seams . <p> " The right one , yes ... and now the left one a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes she 'd get so disgusted with all the straightening that she would turn around abruptly enough to knock me down . " Damn it , girl . I did n't see you . Do n't you know you 're in the way ? " <p> Evenings , my mother was nervous and distant as if she were already somewhere else where she was n't a mother anymore . Evenings , she did n't adore my little brother any more than she did me . It had been evening when she had promise me the black dress . <p> Electricity was very expensive , so we were forbidden to turn on any lights . Since I could n't sleep that early , I had saved up enough money for a flashlight by getting beer for the men in the courtyard . Then I could lie reading by its light underneath the covers . My little brother nearly always fell asleep right away . He never woke up until much later in the night , and then he 'd wake up crying . I constantly dreaded that my mother would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her authority over me gave her the right to rummage through all my possessions . That 's why I always kept the flashlight on me . I would take it to school hidden in my bag . When I was down playing in the courtyard , I kept it hidden in my slacks . That flashlight made my life very difficult . It is difficult to play with a flashlight hidden in your slacks because girls ' slacks do n't have pockets . But even though I was always very careful , sometimes I forgot it . If I went to the bathroom ; I would have to take it out of my slacks . I always sat on the toilet for a long time , reading the old newspapers we used for toilet paper or looking in the mirror . Sometimes I combed my hair and looked at my face while I sat . I would try to make bangs because I was n't allowed to have any . My forehead was the only nice feature I had , my mother said . I had inherited it from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand , everything else was my father 's . <p> Once , I had gotten all the way down to the courtyard before I missed the weight of the flashlight in my slacks . I raced up the stairs , my heart pounding , convinced she had found it . I was all set to lie and tell her that it was n't mine , and that I did n't know how it had gotten there by the toilet . As I ran up the stairs , I could already feel her hands stinging my cheeks . But the flashlight was lying right where I had left it . <p> My little brother had bad dreams . He would wake up and lie there crying until he woke me up . If it was n't enough to yell some comforting words at him like , " What 's the matter ? " or " Just go to sleep . There 's nothing to be afraid of , " then I would have to get up and turn on the light . I think he was afraid of the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . If I turned it off again too soon , he would start wailing again . Sometimes I fell asleep with the light on . The next day I would catch hell for it . About how irresponsible I was . I was unable to explain to her that it was because he had been crying . " Do n't be silly , " she would reply . Naturally , the few times when she was home in the evenings , he was never afraid of the dark . But on those occasions , he was allowed to sleep in her bed . She even shut the door between the two rooms . I lay there alone on the top bunk hating them both . <p> I read my mother 's copies of Reader 's Digest under the covers . She did n't want me to read them . I learned a lot from such Reader 's Digest articles as " The Real Ike , " " Smoking Without Risk , " and " Be Glad You 're Not Beautiful . " <p> The time I found out about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening with my flashlight , three Reader ' s Digests and a package of licorice bought with twenty-five ore stolen from my mother 's purse . I did n't feel the least bit guilty stealing from her . All that mattered to me was that she did n't find out . On a piece of paper I tore out of my notebook , I tested myself . There were actually a lot of tests in Reader 's Digest to find out who you were . " Do you think like a man or a woman ? " was the name of this one . I chewed on the pencil , ate some licorice , held my flashlight between my knees , and was feeling quite contented . Next door at the neighbors ' , right on the other side of the wall next to my bed , a card game was in progress . The wall was very thin , and I could hear everything . How they hit the table and swore and shuffled the cards and clinked their bottles . The sound was very cozy and pleasant and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the evenings when they did n't play cards , I missed it so much that I had trouble falling asleep . <p> Do you think spotted tablecloths are ugly ?

A clothes B intelligence <p> After totaling up the figures in the back of the magazine , I was upset to find out that I thought like a man . I hoped I would improve before I became an adult because otherwise no man would ever many me . But perhaps it was because I could only answer the parts I knew anything about . Poetry , I did n't know what it was ; a party , I had never been to one ; and clothes , they bored me . <p> But my concern was nothing next to what I discovered in the second Reader 's Digest that evening in an article entitled " The Most Important Years of Your Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me reconsider . But I read it slowly and deliberately while eating licorice . Not until quite a ways into it did I realize it was about me . I 'm flawed , defective , that 's what makes me so odd . That 's why I laugh at school and think my mother is smelly and repulsive . I got hot under the covers , and the flashlight slipped down because my legs were shaking . " Your child 's first three years are the most important , " it said . " A child who has n't had contact with its parents during the first years of its life will be a misfit with an inadequate personality . " Personality . That was what my mother always said I did n't have . " Your child needs stimulation . " I did n't know what that meant . But it sounded like being tickled , and I had n't been .

" I would never be happy . Therefore , no matter how hard I tried , I would always fail . It all applied to me , every word of it . And my mother would say : " Everything always has to concern you , you always have to be the center of attention . " I did n't think I did . But that 's what it said . " If a child gets off to a wrong start , it will have an enormous need to be the center of attention and will do everything to attract attention . " I turned off the flashlight , crawled down under the covers , and cried . <p> Of course they stopped playing cards next door right after I discovered my defect . I could n't sleep . I lay there awake speculating all night long . What was I to do ? Leave home ? Go to my father ? But my defect would still be there , inside me . I was awake when my little brother woke up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled for yelling at him , and he cried for a long time . I was still awake when my mother came home and started fumbling with her douche . But I did n't say anything , of course , and pretended to be asleep . <p> After I found out about my defect , I stopped reading Reader 's Digest . Instead , I read cookbooks . Now under the covers I looked at pictures of roast beef and layer cakes and desserts . Whereas before I had fallen asleep with " How Children Are Raised in the Soviet Union " or " Before Young People Get Married , " now it was " Stir four eggs well , blend with sugar and butter . Bake at medium temperature . " <p> But it was never the same as Reader 's Digest , and I always yearned to go back to the time before I found my defect . Once in a while I would ask myself : " Remember how happy you used to be ? " Now that happy period was gone forever , and I had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Translated by Stuart Goodale <p> Born in 1944 , Vita Andersen made her literary debut as a poet in 1977 with the phenomenally popular collection Tryghedsnarkomaner ( Security Junkies ) , which went into twelve printings . That was followed by two plays , a collection of stories , Hold kaeft og vaer smuk ( Shut Up and Be Beautiful , 1978 ) , and two novels , Hvad for en hand vil du ha ' ( Which Hand Do You Want , 1987 ) , which was shortlisted for the Literature Prize of the Nordic Council , and Sebastians kaerlighed ( Sebastian 's Love , 1992 ) . Her most recent book is the collection of stories Jeg er bare ligeglad ( I Could n't Care Less , 1993 ) . The story presented here , " My Defect , " is from Hold kaeft og vaer smuk , and it is characteristic of Andersen 's fiction in that it seeks the universal through the particular and the social .
