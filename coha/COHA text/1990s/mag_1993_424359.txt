Leading health organizations suggest we eat at least five servings of vegetables and fruits and at least five or more servings of whole grains , cereals , and legumes to reach a daily goal of 20-35 grams of fiber . Unfortunately , most Americans consume only half the recommended amount . That 's where beans come in . Spilling the Beans <p> Beans are a rich source of soluble fiber , the same gummy fiber found in oat products . The fiber acts in the body to lower cholesterol and blood sugar . Although there are more than 14,000 specimens in the legume family , only 22 are grown for human consumption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ancient Greeks , who would hold a " bean feast " to honor Apollo . Although beans were once called " poor man 's meat , " they have recently undergone a renaissance of popularity , thanks to health-conscious consumers who enjoy this economical source of versatile and delicious nutrition . <p> ILLUSTRATION : <p> The secret to the health benefits of beans lies in their nutrient composition . Beans are high in fiber , low in fat and cholesterol , and packed with vegetable protein , as well as vitamins and minerals .

All beans have virtually the same amount of calories  --  about 95 calories per 1/2 cup cooked . The fiber content of beans is primarily associated with their seed coat , with 1/2 cup of cooked beans providing about 5 grams of total fiber .

Studies in Switzerland show that a rise in the hormone insulin triggers hunger ; a lunch that is " full of beans " keeps insulin levels low , which may prevent overeating later in the day . This insulin-lowering effect can last for hours . <p> Coronary Heart Disease  --  Perhaps the most convincing evidence of the health benefits of beans can be seen in the prevention of coronary heart disease . Dietary fiber , such as that found in beans , decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke by lowering blood fats and blood pressure , improving blood sugar , and assisting in weight maintenance . <p> More recent research shows that dry beans are as effective as oat bran in lowering cholesterol ; 1/2 cup dry weight of either oat bran or dry beans lowers serum cholesterol about 19 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total legume consumption in the United States , and fortunately , canned beans also are effective cholesterol-lowering choices .
