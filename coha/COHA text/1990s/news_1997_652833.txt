<p> " At Beneficial  --  toot toot  --  you 're good for more , " sang out Steve Karmen in a midtown recording studio . He segued into " When you say BUD-weis-er , you 've said it all ! , " " You can take Salem out of the country . . . . , " " Ford , that 's incredible ! " and wound up with his goldenmost oldie , " I Love New York , " now celebrating its 20th anniversary with television spots featuring Mr. Karmen in black tie at the piano . They do n't call him King of the Jingle for nothing . <p> But when it comes to royalties from his creations , Mr. Karmen , along with other jingle writers , has been singing the blues . <p> He charges that the leading performance-rights society , Ascap , the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers , has been shortchanging them for years to the advantage of " the biggies , " as he calls writers of old standards who get a bigger vote at Ascap and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than original jingles regardless of play time . So-called featured music is fully credited at 100 percent ; jingles at 3 percent of that . <p> " Jingles are a Rodneyism " ( as in Dangerfield ) , Mr. Karmen , 60 , wrote in his 1989 book , " Through the Jingle Jungle . " " They do n't get no respect . " But it 's not really about jingles or him , he says . It 's about how the music royalty business is run . <p> " We want the same financial respect as Richard Rodgers , " he said , adding that Ascap had no business imposing value judgments but should simply record the duration of plays and distribute receipts accordingly , as is widely done in Europe . <p> " If his music is on for three minutes and mine is on for three minutes , " he said of the composer of " Blue Moon , " " My Funny Valentine " and " If I Loved You , " " what is the difference ? " Moreover , he said , if Ascap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of music played , it would find that popular songs are fading off the air and should be devalued accordingly . <p> Those are fighting words at Ascap , founded in New York in 1914 to license the most beloved canon of the American songbook . " Obviously , a background cue on a TV show is not going to be as valuable as a feature performance of a song . " said Marilyn Bergman , the society 's president and a noted songwriter who created the lyrics for " The Way We Were " and " You Do n't Bring Me Flowers , " popularized by Barbra Streisand . For its part , Ascap says it is doing what it is supposed to be doing : taking " objective surveys of performances " to collect fees for its 70,000 members as provided under an anti-monopoly settlement with the Justice Department and dividing the money according to a court-sanctioned weighting system . Last year , Ascap led the industry with revenue of $482 million , of which , it said , $406 million was passed on to members . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went after the American Camping Association , enmeshing itself in a public relations fiasco last year over campfire songs with the Girl Scouts . ) <p> " He 's saying , ' I do n't have enough ; I should have more , ' " I. Fred Koenigsberg , Ascap 's counsel at the Manhattan law firm of White &; Case , said of Mr. Karmen . He called the jingle writer " an amazingly talented guy " who had lost at every stage of a 15-year campaign against Ascap 's weighted royalties . <p> But Mr. Karmen , an Ascap member for 25 years , refuses to be silenced , as perhaps befits someone whose commercial hit parade includes ditties for Wrigley 's Spearmint Gum , Dial Soap , the Nevele Hotel , Hertz Rent-a-Car and General Tires among many others that once heard become naggingly difficult to get out of the brain . <p> How music played on radio and television is monitored and paid for are not issues likely to preoccupy the average listener . But they are of overriding concern to the creators and music publishers whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawning a billion-dollar performance-rights industry that is once again in the spotlight . <p> The Senate Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold hearings on the hotly contested fairness in music licensing bill , which would allow restaurants , bars and businesses to entertain patrons with radio and television without buying permission from music copyright holders . The measure would also carve out a broader exemption for religious broadcasters , who now pay for blanket performance licenses they say they do not need for music they do not always like . <p> Uproar over the measure has delayed action on another bill to add 20 years of copyright protection to new and old songs . Songs written before 1978 would have their copyright protection extended to 95 years after composition . Songs written after 1978 would be copyrighted for the life of the composer , plus 70 years . <p> Perhaps not surprisingly , Mr. Karmen is on the side of the bars and restaurants and against extending the copyrights . With only one royalties pie to divide , he says , the sooner the older works enter the public domain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works are actually being broadcast today " instead of providing " an unjustified golden pension to the children and grandchildren of those whose music no longer earns it . " <p> Both sides cast themselves as champions of struggling songwriters who , but for their small royalties , would be driven out of the business , impoverishing American culture . <p> Ascap and its two competitors , Broadcast Music Inc. , known as BMI , and Sesac , formerly the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers , operate as giant ears to monitor the music played and as bill collectors to take in the fees and distribute them to the copyright holders . BMI , a New York nonprofit corporation founded in 1939 , reports a client list of 180,000 songwriters and publishers . Sesac , a Nashville for-profit corporation founded in 1930 , represents 2,300 music professionals . BMI and Sesac have their own weighting systems . The process is staggeringly complex . In addition to the millions of hours of monitoring , the societies blend a variety of factors to arrive at royalty figures . <p> One industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said songwriters and their estates had hired him to decipher just how they are being paid . As a rough example , he said , a song played on a major New York radio station might bring the writer who created the work and the publisher who exploits its value $160 each a play and perhaps 10 times as much on television , a far rarer occurrence . Art of the Spiel : Violins and Drums <p> The royalties dispute pits Ascap against Mr. Karmen , a Bronx High School of Science graduate and Westchester resident who went from humble beginnings in the " nudie movie scoring business , " as he put it , to master the art and craft of jingle writing , which helped him bring up his three daughters after his wife died of cancer . <p> In his book , he explains how to write and market jingles . " Suppose you are writing for an airline , " he says . " The agency wants the music to say ' flying , ' to establish a floaty yet secure feeling . Airlines should never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane with a rubber band . " He suggests " a violin sweep as the plane takes off " and , yes , French horns , with their long floating tones : " Today every airline is out to out-French-horn every other airline . " <p> For cars , he says , hot drum tracks are good . For deluxe models , lush strings or a classical piano . Cola songs need bounce . Perfume ? Solo guitar or unaccompanied flute with a lot of echo . <p> For the Beneficial commercial , Mr. Karmen says , he was handed the slogan " You 're good for more . " But instead of using the line as given , he says , " I chose to break it up with a mnemonic ' toot toot , ' to try to make it sound different . " <p> But it 's not just Karmen v. Ascap . There is a so-called Ascap judge , William C. Conner of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains who , besides regular cases , adjudicates the antitrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form or other for 56 years . There is his predecessor , Harold R. Tyler , a distribution adviser to the court , and his West Coast counterpart , Seth Hufstedter . A lawyer in the Justice Department Antitrust Division , Mary Beth McGee , monitors the order . <p> " If Ascap did n't exist , someone would have to invent it in a hurry , " said Judge Conner , who is deciding a challenge brought by the National Religious Broadcasters in another attack on blanket license fees . <p> Musical ability is irrelevant and extraneous to his job , he said in an interview . " I never try to sing in public , " he said . " When God was passing out musical talent , he passed me by . " <p> The Federal involvement grew out of prewar complaints that Ascap was monopolizing the licensing of popular music . In a 1941 settlement , the society and the Government agreed to a set of fairness standards . BMI and the Government signed a more limited decree in 1966 . <p> Under the Ascap system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured music , up from 1 percent in the 1970 's . But when an old standard like Gershwin 's " Rhapsody in Blue " is used in a United Airlines commercial , it is paid at 12 percent of the full rate . Theme music and background music have their own weighted rates . <p> According to figures cited by an Ascap lawyer , while a Cole Porter song played at the televised Academy Award ceremony might bring the Porter estate and the publisher $1,250 each , a jingle by Mr. Karmen would bring him and his publisher $37.50 each . ( This does not take into account one-time fees of $5,000 to $10,000 paid to the jingle writer by the advertising agency and the vastly higher sums paid for the use of popular songs . ) <p> " Based on what opinion is this less valuable ? " said Joey Levine , another jingle writer ( " Sometimes you feel like a you feel like a nut , sometimes you do n't " ) , who joined Mr. Karmen 's court challenge with eight others . " Sammy Cahn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 100 more plays . But Sammy will still get paid 100 percent on his plays . It 's so lopsided . " He and Mr. Karmen , among other jingle writers , say the system is perpetuated by hit songwriters who have up to 100 times the voting power of other members , depending on their performance successes . Ascap denies that they have enough clout to sway a majority . Same Old Song ? A Judge Says So <p> Judge Conner has heard this song before , noting that he dismissed the jingle writers ' challenge in his court , as did the Federal Appeals Court for the Second Circuit in August 1994 . " I did go into it and found it was not unfair , " he said . But Mr. Karmen still hopes to win over the Justice Department and the District Court with incessant pleas for modification of the weighting system . <p> Although he recently wrote , pro bono , " The Faces of America " for the Greater New York Hospital Association campaign against health-care cuts , for now he is out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new challenges . <p> As he sat at the piano the other day in the Howard Schwartz Recording studio in Manhattan noodling a medley of his most recognizable jingles , he said he would never stop fighting his case but that he needed a breather .
