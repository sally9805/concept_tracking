There were two women I thought might be able to help me , or rather help Lance , and that night , sitting on the bus on the way home from the hospital , I vowed to find one or both of them the next day , even if I had to cancel a couple of my afternoon classes to do it . There was always Sammy , of course , but I was anxious to keep him out of it because every hand up you get from Sammy today is one you wo n't be getting tomorrow . It does n't matter whether the stuff is for me , Lance , or Santa Claus-I 'm the one who 's asking so it 's going straight onto my balance sheet . Sammy shares the house with me and my son , Adam , and the Old Lady , the maid/nanny we pay to watch soap operas . <p> I should have been using the two-hour trip to grade papers , but I could n't face it , and the bus driver was weaving through traffic as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the back of the bus swung wildly across the lanes , making the passengers grab for the tops of seats to avoid being pitched into the aisle . With the kung fu movie blasting above my head and all the blank faces staring up at it while they spooned the dinners someone had prepared for them into their mouths , it was like being in twenty living rooms at once . I could n't wait to be inside my own house and enjoy the hour between getting there and going to bed that my home life had dwindled to since I started going to the hospital after work . I had barely laid eyes on Sammy in weeks , between my coming in late and him keeping stranger hours than usual , but I was just as happy to avoid him . I owed him a few baht for an advance he 'd given me-only an ounce or soand he was pissed off about a deal with a friend of mine who , he said , had screwed him over . I 've never met the man who could stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , that 's the end of it . No further discussion . <p> That left Sister Michael as my first choice of savior . She 's a nurse at the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital , where I 'd done one of my detoxes . I had long suspected she had a little thing for me , which would n't hurt . It would be tricky , though , because she was a toughie , the only ex-nun at Seventh Day who retained her male saint 's name when she went AWOL . Second and last resort was Noi , an ex-student of mine , but she would involve money changing hands . Since Angie left , I had n't been with anybody ( of course I ca n't properly say I was ever with Angie , but that 's a whole other story ) , but occasionally , when the money situation loosened up , I visited Noi down at Soi Cowboy where she worked . Noi had wanted to improve her English so she could actually converse with her customers beyond " You want hand fuck ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd signed up for my class . She even paid for it herself . We never actually did it , but I liked to share body heat with her , have her slip me the tongue . It was nothing seriousshe usually did n't even take out her chewing gum . Anyway , I knew Noi had connections and might be able to get me some prescription pills-stuff Lance would n't consider too low for him to stoop to-if she could skim a little off the top without her guy realizing . <p> I needed a wide variety-painkillers , barbiturates , Valium , whatever-since you never know exactly what 's going to work when they 're so far gone . The best would have been junk , but I knew Lance would never take it , even if I fixed him up , so it was useless to try persuading him that it would make everything feel better . It was an image thing-shooting just did n't fit in with his vision of himself . Lance saw himself as some other kind of person , the kind who would never ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do shoot primarily define themselves : Well , here I go again , because I 'm a junkie , and this is what we do , this is how we see ourselves . Give me a break . So far I 'd resisted the temptation to say , Are you the kind of person who imagined himself rotting in a scummy hospital in a slum outside of Bangkok ? Held hostage in a filthy bed at the mercy of a bunch of snotty nurses , the recipient of everyone 's scornful pity , a body that others avert their eyes from because it 's too painful for them to look at you ? Why screw everything up for someone who 's dying , anyway , all their years of hard work down the drain ? <p> I say work because you could tell right off when you met Lance just from the way he carried himself-before all this happened , I mean-that he had a very definite idea of how to present himself , Lance , to the world , and that it had taken him a very long time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a certain admiration for people who can do that , even though I do n't necessarily like them , and usually even dislike them . Here I am , a blind blob of something , a clam or an oyster that someone has torn from his shell-not necessarily to eat , possibly just for the hell of it-then tossed back into the water , where I bob along for all the world to see , waiting to be swamped by a wave or gobbled up by any old predator that comes along . And there those other people are , the Lances of the world , with their million layers of protection and self-definition , unreachable and impenetrable . It was n't until Lance got sick that I saw the slightest crack in his persona ; and even then he managed to keep up appearances for a good while . <p> One of the first , and one of the few , times I saw him lose it was about a month after he 'd been hospitalized . I 'd gone on a Saturday , which was rare because Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam on some outing , but the Old Lady 's niece and her spoiled kid were coming for the day , and I decided to clear out and pay Lance a surprise visit . Sammy was gone already , God knows where . Relations between me and Sammy had been deteriorating , which worried me a little , but I figured I 'd deal with it later , when there was more time . I knew he did n't like me visiting Lance so often , maybe just because it was a change and Sammy does n't like changes . Or maybe he had some Sammy-logic that was known only to his brain ; whatever the reason , he was out more and generally chillier when he was home-doing the crossword without me just to make a point , stuff like that . Anyway , since there was no patching up to be done that morning , I thought I 'd keep Lance company , bring some work with me , see how things were going there , and maybe if he felt good enough , we 'd play a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless at the game-in the hospital , at least , he had no heart for it . Maybe it was too reminiscent of the fact that he had no move to make for himself now-whatever control , at least by legal methods , he could have had over the situation probably evaporated as soon as they got him into that hospital . <p> The hall was empty , per usual . Lance was in a ward the staff worked hard to avoid . The receptionist had nodded me in , recognizing me by now , although she rarely looked me in the face . He did n't have many visitors ; even the other gay men in our office could n't bring themselves to come more than once or twice . <p> I knocked and then opened the door gently , so as not to startle him . He looked at me through puffy eyes , like he 'd been crying for some time , and his cheeks still had sleep crinkles from the coarse pillowcase . Both activities were so recently represented on his face , he could only have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . <p> He looked at me vaguely , then , after a few seconds , like he knew who I was . " Did you just get here ? What are you doing here ? It 's Saturday . " <p> " I know . " I put my papers down on the floor and sat in the only chair . There was absolutely nothing to look at in the room but each other . " Thought I could inveigle you into some chess . " His face looked so distraught , and was such a contrast to his normally composed features , that I had to look away ; staring at the floor was preferable , despite the presence of a metal bowl next to his bed that he had vomited into during the night and no one had come to take away . I was about to get up and rinse it in the sink , so I would n't have to smell the odor , and to make myself busy while he got under control , when Lance said , " I was dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago-the worst dream I ever had . " His mouth looked like he was going to cry more . He must have become conscious of his lower lip trembling because he chewed on one side of it for a second . " It was a dream that I had AIDS , and I was in the hospital , and no one would come visit me . And if they did come , they just stared at me through a little glass window in the door of my room and would n't enter . No one would touch me . " <p> I muttered , " Oh , no , that 's not . . I 'm sure . . . , " something I thought would be comforting , but he spoke over me , which was probably for the best because I had launched into a sentence without really having a plan for where it was going . <p> " I lay in bed , and I could see different people 's faces at the little window , my brother and my parents , and then random dream people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying and crying , saying over and over , I 'm so lonely , I 'm so lonely . But you know what the worst part was ? " He was talking so quickly , a ragged breath every now and then obliterating a word entirely , he would n't have heard a response if I 'd made one . " When I woke up , I could n't remember if I had it or not . I lay in bed not knowing for about ten minutes , before I figured out that I was perfectly healthy . And that 's what happened to me this morning , too . Only I woke up in this shithole instead of my bed , which was my first tip-off . But I still was n't sure , I thought maybe I was really here for something else , you know like a hernia operation " - he almost laughed , but it was swallowed up in a sob- " and a bad night in the hospital had given me an anxiety dream . It took me a few minutes to realize that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worse . " <p> I was silent . Any words of comfort would have sounded fatuous and artificial , and I was a little caught off-guard seeing Lance weep so openly . I had barely even seen him scowl , before the hospital . Of course he was n't the same since , essentially , being locked up to die , but most of the time he managed to carry off an almost collusive air , as though it were all happening to someone else . Like he was on the side doing the pitying , and the pity-ee was a third , invisible party in the room that we had to be careful not to allude to in any way , lest we offend him . I got up to put the bowl in the sink , hating the noticeably heavy footfall of my bad leg as I crossed the room and how the tap of my cane on the linoleum gave a syncopated rhythm to the sounds that were coming from the bed . <p> With a name like Lance Potter , you almost have to go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lance was striving for the latter but fell short , headlong into that middle ground , which is where you run into trouble . His natural tendency was to be a little snarky , but he tried to disguise it under a patina of false good will . It was n't just that he was insincere , it was something physical ; even his good looks were fakey . In fact , it was the day I ran into him at Bobby 's Arms , when he was still healthy , or at least still looked healthy , that I finally figured out what about him had been nagging at me ever since I 'd first met him . <p> I was surprised to see Lance at Bobby's-the place was n't his style . Bobby 's is musty and moribund , full of farang doing their best to escape the crud of Bangkok : the heat and glaring sun , the choking fumes . Bobby 's was one of the few places that catered to foreigners but not tourists , which meant bar girls were n't constantly thrusting themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , Lance claimed to avoid farang ghettos like the plague , though I 'd heard he frequented some of the raunchier boy bars in town-places like The Saloon , where patrons could fire blanks at little boys onstage whose job it was to duck for cover behind cardboard horses and saguaro cacti , and Club zi , where teenagers were led around in chains . The rumor mill also had it that he lived with a young Thai kid . Then again , I 'd heard gossip that I went down to Klong Toey and hustled with the drag junkies , so who knows , maybe it was all bull . <p> I myself went to Bobby 's to play chess , but Lance preferred games like go-fish and gin , where you could bluff , not the all-out war that chess involves . What most people fail to understand about chess is that it is n't a game . Even the most minute weakness of the opponent has to be immediately exploited , until he 's backed into a corner , trapped , and killed . Lance tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little detente moves that were the end of him . The men who played at Bobby 's were almost all vets from Vietnam or Korea , so they understood this aspect of the game . Most of them had married Thai women , ex-bar girls who now ran little export businesses or restaurants , and the men still talked and acted like they were on leave , kind of a permanent R &R.; <p> And Bobby 's was quiet . Even the cacophony from the street did n't seep in there-it was much quieter than our house , where punks on motorcycles roared by at all hours and vendors screamed up and down the street , until you went out and bought something just so they 'd shut up and move on . The door at Bobby 's was four-inch-thick wood , and there were only a couple of tiny thick-paned windows , set way up high in the wall like in a dungeon . <p> The afternoon I saw Lance there , he was sitting at a table reading , his head bent and chin resting on his palm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little squares of glass overhead , making his hair shine . I remember thinking he was probably reading one of the incredibly trashy books he favored-he had the worst taste in entertainment of anyone I 'd ever met-and then I recall noticing , as I watched him unobserved for a few seconds , that he had colored his hair . I was very surprised , shocked almost , because he was only about thirty-five and his slightly pudgy baby face , always completely hairless-not even the shadow of a beard-made him look even younger . His brown hair was darker around his ears than on top , and in the soft beam from the window , it had a brassy red overlay , a metallic sheen that could only have been the product of a dye . Suddenly his fresh-faced health looked like something that was perfectly fine on top but , when you turned it over with your shoe , was all rotten underneath . <p> Just then he looked up from his book and waved me over , polite as always . He kicked the chair across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What are you doing here , Francis ? " he said , cracking the spine of his book gruesomely so it would stay flat-fortunately it was only The Bad Seed . I stretched my leg out and leaned my cane against the wall . <p> " Getting out of this heat , maybe pick up a chess game . And you ? What are you doing here ? I come here with J.C . all the time and we 've never seen you here . " J.C . was one of the other teachers who could n't stand Lance , and Lance knew it . <p> " Just reading . I have n't seen J.C . in weeks , I thought maybe he 'd been fired . " He smiled one of his noxious **29;751;TOOLONG smiles . " I 'm teaching at the Daiwa Bank tonight , on Soi 4 . It 's right around the corner . " Daiwa was one of the plum jobs the Institute tossed us-teaching English at night to a bunch of bankers . Good money , eager students-a breeze . I 'd taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole fiasco about my contract , they 'd given it to Lance . I did n't know if he was the one who had ratted to our department head , Achara-also known as the Viper-about my little habit , but I had a strong suspicion . He knew that piece of information would get him a perk somewhere down the line . In the end , nothing much came of it except that I had to produce a doctor 's certificate saying I was dean before the university would renew my teaching contract . An Australian friend of Sammy 's did it for five hundred baht , but I resented everybody knowing about it and having to spend the money . <p> " I know where it is ; ' I said . <p> Lance laughed nervously . " Oh , right . " He picked up his book and waved it enthusiastically . " Have you read this ? It 's greatreally gripping . " <p> " No . " <p> " I 'll lend it to you if you want , when I 'm done . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay ; ' I said . " I 'm in the middle of a few things . " We chatted for a few more minutes , and then he rather awkwardly got up to leave . Maybe he felt bad about the job . " Can we play chess sometime ? " he said . " You can teach me . But you 're probably really good , right ? " <p> I shrugged . " Sure , if you like . " I was hoping I 'd never have the opportunity . What I really wanted was to come out and ask him directly about the Viper , but then I decided with a liar as smooth as Lance , you 'd never know for sure unless he was ready to tell you . He was waving goodbye before I had a chance to change my mind , and I was glad to be free of his babble about what he had watched on video the night before-ten episodes of The Golden Girls , all at once . His favorite was the one where Betty White asks one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband died to do it with another man , and she says , " Till the paramedics got there . " I was to hear that countless times in the next few months , and it never amused him any less . No matter how often he told you , he 'd slap his leg and laugh , the corners of his mouth wet with saliva . <p> Lance left for the bank , and I stayed and played a few hours of chess before going home to the kiln that was our house in summer . I tried to stay out at least until the sun went down . When I pulled open the heavy wooden door to leave Bobby 's , it was dusk and as hot out as it had been at noon . I 've always loved twilight in the tropics . It comes and goes quickly , and then it 's dark , not that lingering murk you get farther north . The light everywhere was soft and consistent , padding Bangkok in a thick gray blanket streaked with purples and pinks . I felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it changing wavelengths , speeding up and slowing down as it passed through different media-metal , glass , air . An upstairs room across the alley looked like it was deep under the ocean where the sun penetrates just enough so that you can make out shapes but nothing has edges or shadows . There was a mobile with angelfish on it hanging in the window , and the evening breeze was moving the fish around so it looked like they had taken over the place-flooded everything and kicked out the people . <p> For some reason , that twenty minutes at Bobby 's with Lance had allowed the thought into my head that it might be possible , under the right circumstances , to get an honest answer out of him , and I wanted to know badly , irrationally , if he had been the one who had gone to Achara and violated the farang solidarity in our department . Maybe noticing that he dyed his hair made him seem vulnerable to me for the first time . Later , when I thought about it , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers or read to him , and sometimes even tried to let him beat me at chess , I realized that I had n't asked that day at Bobby 's because I could n't stand to hear him lie about it . That was the beginning of me wanting Lance to tell me the truth , even if I had to wait a long time for that to happen . <p> Lance lied by second nature . I did n't believe most of the stories he told when we all sat around the teachers ' lounge swapping anecdotes . In the hospital he seemed different , but then again , why would he lie to me about his childhood , about people I had never met and never would meet ? Sometimes I wondered , though . Before he got sick he was often sarcastic , but not openly like the other expats , which was for humor or to tease . Lance 's cynicism was slyer , masquerading as an overly polite veneer that mocked by its very inappropriateness . His manner put off the other Americans most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he actually thought you believed he was for real . It was hard not to stop him in the middle of one of his archly delivered jokes and say , Do n't pull this on me . Some putz from Perth or Liverpool might fall for it , but I know your kind , and there 's millions just like you where you came from . The suburbs are oozing with Lance Potters . But I 'll give him this . Now and then , when he laughed that ironic laugh , not the bogus hearty chuckle he forced for the Thai teachers ' sake , the name Lance seemed perfect for him-undercutting not just everything that touched him , but himself , too . <p> He must have actually succeeded at being the boy next door when he was a kid-hell , he probably believed it himself-at least until it became apparent his interest in the other boy next door was outstripping his interest in the girl next door . Even then , Lance was smart enough to know that would n't sit well with the good folks of Chippewa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dear by his parents and neighbors , he bided his time till he could escape , and once he was gone , he was gone for good . There are probably little old ladies in Chippewa Falls who still get a warm glow when they think about the boy from church who shoveled snow off the walk so they would n't fall and break their brittle backs , maybe freeze to death inches from their porches on the outskirts of Chippewa proper . That was the image Lance had been trying to project , at least at first , as if that could save him , as if even a disease could be disarmed by boyish charm . Later , when there was no hiding how sick he was , he could n't quite give it up completely , which was why I think he never let me contact his family . I do n't know if they would have come , or tried to get him sent home , or what . Instead , I was the last person he was withme , someone who only a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> The bus driver craned his head backward so he could see the movie , too , and the bus narrowly missed swiping a telephone pole . Packages that had been balanced on laps went crashing to the floor around me . I thought that this night was probably one of the last times I 'd visit Lance . He was going downhill quickly , and I was n't sure how much more he could stand ; pharmacological intervention was definitely called for . It would be doing us both a favor . He 'd been pretty out of it for about a week and was barely speaking at all . When he made any noise , it was usually a moan of pain , though he still looked at me and seemed to follow if I said something . The last exchange we 'd had that could be called a conversation was three days earlier , when he 'd woken from a restless sleep , bathed in sweat from his dreams and the oppressively dense , unmoving air in his room . <p> " Francis ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the past few days he 'd been calling me Joey , his dead brother . I said , " Mm-hmm , I have n't left yet , " though I 'd been thinking that I should get going-I was falling asleep over my papers and I had a full load of teaching the next day . " Did I tell you , when I was a kid . , " he went on , in such a weak voice I could barely understand him , " I had a paper route . My favorite thing was to deliver the paper on holidays or Sundays , so early that everyone was still asleep . I 'd get on my bike around quarter of six , and I felt like I was the only one who was awake and on top of things . Like I owned the whole town . " He stopped and rested , wheezing audibly , and I waited for him to go on . This was the most he 'd said at one time in days . " I used to throw the paper , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doormat perfectly square , so when Mr. or Mrs. whoever came out , the paper would be exactly parallel to the door . " <p> " That was nice of you , " I said . " Very thoughtful . Quite the perfectionist ' <p> He raised his head slightly to look at me . I could see a big wet spot on the pillowcase where sweat from the back of his neck had dampened it . " Can you believe that shit ? " he said . " I actually cared that the paper lay just right on the porch . " <p> I shook my head . I 'd had a paper route for a little while , but got fired because one too many irate husbands called and complained that the paper was n't there , or it was late . I always swore to my boss I 'd delivered it on time , but after a while he canned me anyway . <p> " You tell me , " Lance said , letting his head fall back onto the dingy pillowcase , " how I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> I said no , I could n't . Somehow Lance 's not knowing how he 'd gotten there seemed preferable to the line that led so directly between my getting the axe at The Beachcomber , the weekly newspaper , and my present situation . <p> " I was saving up " he said , " to buy the Star of Africa . I was going to be known as The Man Who Owned the Star of Africa , and everyone in Chippewa Falls could say I had been their paper boy . " <p> I did n't tell him I had no idea what the Star of Africa was , and that if I did n't , you could bet no one in Chippewa Falls did , either . <p> The hospital they 'd moved Lance to was about two and a half hours north of the city , and by the time I reached home , it was almost eleven , and I was exhausted . The Old Lady had left some unidentifiable mush out for me , and there were flies all over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl right before she went up to bed and after the food had evidently been sitting out long enough for the flies to really embed themselves in it . I gave it a miss and ate a piece of toast with bananas and butter . <p> That day , I 'd had a big fight with one of the nurses because she would n't change Lance 's IV often enough ; instead of switching it when the bag was almost empty , she 'd slow it down to the tiniest drip-the least amount of fluid you could allow out without letting any air into the vein . I found it difficult to eat after staring at that bag all evening . Although at least when Lance was on IVs I did n't have to worry about his food source . Before , when he was still eating solids , the nurses refused to bring his tray into the room . They left it outside the door until I got there , so whatever it was to begin with had congealed and been covered with dirt kicked up by people shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Lady make extra so I could bring it in to work with me and go straight to the hospital when I finished teaching . The Old Lady was crabby about doing more cooking-if you could call it that - and she took it out on my son , the Gripper , who cried more , so Sammy was crabbier , and the result was that my life at home was a living hell . <p> The nurses let Lance sit in a dirty bedpan for hours , so half the time I cleaned it-and him-myself rather than smell the stench . He 'd turn his head away , embarrassed , but it did n't bother me much . I 've seen junkies do the same to themselves , and worse . The rare occasions anyone else from our office came to the hospital , they did n't stay long . You could tell from the expressions on their faces-suddenly they were all such fastidious creatures-that the sights and smells were too much for them . They were thinking that they 'd rather be dead than sink that low . but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of them would be begging and praying for another day to live , just the way Lance was . <p> Of course , they resented me for making them look like cowards and spread malicious rumors about me to make themselves feel better . Everyone in the office had one ally who told them all the crap everyone else said about them ; after Angie left , mine was a young thing from Maryland who never wanted to upset me , but I usually managed to wheedle out of her the rumors that had been poured into her perfect little shell of an ear . <p> This particular set of slanders , however , was even worse than I 'd imagined , and she repeated them to me in a shocked whisper , as if my hearing them at a lower volume would make them less hurtful : that I was a voyeur , that I had tested positive already and I was preparing for what was coming , trying to figure out how to get around in that hospital system-that I was in effect considering Lance 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd ever be stupid enough to let myself fall into the clutches of the people who 'd gotten their hands on Lance . I guess it made our colleagues feel better about their own behavior to see mine in that light . The gay ones were probably scared shitless the hospital would grab them and lock them up , the way they 'd gotten Lance . <p> First , Lance had gone to a regular hospital , a ritzy private one , to check out a cough that had been hanging on for weeks . After the pneumonia diagnosis , they tested him without telling him , and next thing he knew , he was being strapped into an ambulance and whisked away to a special " high security " hospital up-country , even though he said he felt fine . After all , he 'd had only a mild bout , but there the ward doors were locked and they would n't let him leave . <p> When Lance called me that Sunday morning , after spending the weekend in the hospital , he did n't let on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice , partly because no one in Bangkok relies on telecommunication , so the phone hardly ever rings , and because Lance was n't one of the few people who called me at home . I 'm still not sure why he called me particularly . I guess he knew there were certain things about my lifestyle that precluded me judging other people 's . <p> When I put the phone to my ear , the background was crackly , and I could hear high-pitched giggles coming over another line we 'd intersected . " Francis ? It 's Lance , " he said in his self-confident way , emphasizing his name in case I did n't know who he was . " Lance Potter . " As if he were a salesman and he wanted to be sure I remembered him later . <p> I said , " Yeah , I know . Hi , Lance . What 's up ? " Our conversation sounded more stilted and awkward because of the voices laughing over it . I wondered if they could hear us , too . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , while he tried to figure out if the laughter was coming from my apartment . " I guess there are n't that many Lances in Bangkok , " he said , and chuckled a little too heartily . <p> " Just enough , " I said laughing a little as well , but not very enthusiastically . " So . . . what 's up ? " I did n't want to be rude in case he had called just to say hello , though I knew it was improbable , but I wanted him to get to the point . <p> " So , I need a favor . Would you mind ? " <p> " Depends what it is , does n't it ? " I had n't forgotten about that whole other thing , with my doctor 's certificate . <p> " Oh , it 's no big deal , " he said quickly . " Can you just tell Achara tomorrow morning that I wo n't be in for a few days ? I tried to call her at home , but her phone must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Where are you ? Stuck out of town ? Did you suddenly fall in love with a village beauty ? " Lance was n't really out at work , though everyone knew he was gay , so sometimes I liked to give him a little jab about it , to keep him on his toes . He humored me with a dry snort . In the background I heard an announcement paging someone , and then I knew instantly Lance was in the hospital . I think I even knew why , though nothing in his voice betrayed it . <p> " Oh , right , that 's what I meant to tell you . I 'm quitting ! No , I 'm in the hospital , in Siriwan . I had one of those intestinal things , and they 're running some tests to make sure they got it all . Must have been one of those crabs they fish out of the sewers and dish up at the Goethe Institute Sunday brunch . " He lied without missing a beat . <p> It was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I realized how difficult it must have been for him to feign cheerfulness on the phone that day . After we 'd hung up , he 'd called his boyfriend to tell him he had been involuntarily removed to a different hospital , and on top of that , they were n't letting him go home to get clothes and books , and could the boyfriend-I never heard Lance say his name or mention him except to tell me thisplease bring Lance a few things he needed , and he never heard from the guy again . By the time I went over to Lance 's place to get some of his stuff , the boyfriend was long gone . He 'd cleaned the place out-Lance 's expensive stereo , the microwave and American blender a friend had brought him , his VCR-but there was no point in telling Lance . I knew he 'd never get back there to find out for himself . <p> By Monday afternoon , the whole office knew because when I told Achara that Lance was in Siriwan Hospital , she put two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for patient confidentiality ; I guess the place already had a rep to Thais as a containment vessel . I do n't know if Achara had the clout to get him out , but she did n't seem too inclined to try . So much for him ponying me up in return for everlasting favors from the Viper . Maybe she thought that 's where he belonged , or at least as much as any other poor bastard who ended up there . <p> Lots of the other patients were bar girls and boys , and junkies into the bargain , since rich people or ones with well-connected relatives knew better than to entrust themselves to any government hospital . If one of them got it , General somebody-or-other 's eldest son , say , who 'd made a few too many trips to the cathouse , well , he was kept at home , with private nurses . At Siriwan , people with lethal infectious diseases were all lined up next to one another in the same room , on cots a few feet apart , hacking up sputum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedsides . Thanks to a high level of xenophobia , Lance had his own private cubicle with a door and everything . Then , AIDS was still being treated as a farang disease , so any foreigners who had it were despised as bringers of death upon an innocent people . <p> When I finished my toast , I went upstairs to look in on my son . The Gripper , as I call him , had strewn toys , books , tin cans , all over the floor in the hallway separating his room from Sammy 's but I was too tired to do anything about it , even though I knew Sammy would give me hell about the mess . The Old Lady had nothing to do now that the kid was in pre-school half the day , but that did n't seem to result in the house being any cleaner . I opened the door as quietly as I could and saw the Gripper asleep , one little hand , still wet from sucking his thumb , curled up on the Old Lady 's wrinkled , sagging breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in days . After Suchada , Adam 's mother , left , the Old Lady started sleeping with the Gripper because his was the only airconditioned room in the house . I still slept downstairs on the mattress where I 'd been sleeping ever since Suchada kicked me out of the bedroom when the Gripper was born . <p> I borrowed Sammy 's radio from the kitchen and put it next to my head to listen to the BBC world news hour , then fell asleep still dressed but minus my boots . I was so wiped out , I dropped off without my last fix of the night , but into more of a nap than a deep sleep , where I was half-awake and knew I was dreaming but could n't put a stop to it . I dreamt I was looking at a picture of myself , and the picture was of me looking at a picture , and that picture was of me , and on and on . Then in my dream I woke up , and I knew , more clearly than I had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what is recorded of every thought , every act , is pure chance . Evolution only creates a series of altered appearances , a catalogue of ever-changing symptoms . <p> Still dreaming that I was awake , I looked at the picture I held in my hand , and the face in it changed from mine to Lance 's , and I knew he was dead . My body filled up with a fear so palpable , it seeped into my lungs and turned them into two smooth oval stones , dense as diamonds . In the picture , Lance began to yawn , and his mouth became a gaping black hole stretched across his face , into which some invisible hand was pouring his death , a dark liquid which surged down his throat with a power all its own , like a black horse running , then disappeared , to wait and hide inside us until it was ready to come out . A British man 's voice was saying over and over , The Star of Africa , the Star of Africa , and when I awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sweaty cheek off the vinyl of my sleeping mat . The newscaster 's voice was buzzing tinnily in my ear about an uprising in South Africa , and for a disoriented second I thought there was someone in the room with me . The air was still and roasting , and I was soaked , but the premonition had turned my lips cold and my skin clammy . My hands were shaking so much I could barely get the needle in . Poor Lance . His crumbling body was proof of what no expat likes to admit : no matter how far away you get , it 's never far enough . <p> I was sure when I set out the next day after work that when I got to the hospital , one of the slaggy nurses would tell me Lance had gone during the night . I stopped by Seventh Day anyway , just in case , hoping to catch Sister Michael as she was getting off shift . I figured I could always use the stuff myself if it was too late for Lance . Most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital to the next , but I 've never minded hospitals ; maybe because strange behavior is barely noticed in them , or is explained away by strange circumstances . In fact , I find them vaguely relaxing . In hospitals , nobody stares at me because I walk with a cane and a limp . It makes me feel at home , as though I were there for rehabilitation . <p> Sure enough , Sister Michael was at the main registration desk , filling out her paperwork . She looked up when I cleared my throat , then smiled when she saw it was me . She seemed genuinely pleased . <p> " Hello , Francis , " she said . " What brings you here ? Pleasure , I hope . " <p> " Business , I 'm afraid , " I said . " But not for me . I 'm fine . " <p> " Fine in what sense ? " she went on in the same tone , as though we were exchanging pleasantries . " Still alive and working eighty hours a week to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " <p> I never knew how she could tell just by looking at me that I had n't quit . Maybe she still had some connections to the powers that be , left over from her nun days . I nodded to acknowledge her position , the worthlessness of my present life , etc. , etc . It 's not that I disagreed with her , in the abstract I agreed entirely , but principle and practice are two different things . At least I was n't in Lance 's shoes . <p> The last time I 'd seen her was several months earlier , when one of my friend Patrick 's smuggling schemes had backfired and two condoms filled with junk burst in his colon on the way to the airport . Inferior Thai rubber , I guess-could n't stand up to those intestinal enzymes . He was probably spared years in jail , because he looks exactly like the kind of person who would try a scheme like that . The taxi driver saved his life ; when he checked the rearview mirror and saw Patrick slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin , he turned around and took him straight to Seventh Day . Sister Michael was the one who phoned me-she figured anyone in Patrick 's condition with a Bangkok address in his passport had bumped into me or Sammy somewhere along the line . She was becoming kind of the matron saint of the Bangkok junk circuit . <p> " I have this friend . . . , ' I said , getting right to the point and seeing immediately by the set of her face she did n't believe me . " He 's really sick . " I also knew she knew " sick " meant " I 'm not getting enough , and I need something else to take up the slack , " and I let her think it was for me . <p> Sister Michael sighed . " Will you promise to come back before the end of the year ? " she said . " If you do , I 'll see to you personally . " <p> " I 'll try . But- " I rubbed my thumb and first two fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't have any . But I 'm working on something . I 'm putting something together . " Seventh Day was one of the only places that had a real detox program , not the kind where they rope you to the bed and leave you there , but it was also the most expensive . I 'd gone through it once , when Suchada was pregnant with the Gripper , but she had paid for it . That was the agreement , she would n't end the pregnancy if I would straighten up . About three months before Adam was due , not long after I got out of the program , Suchada came home one day and found Patrick at the house and lost it completely . I was n't supposed to hang out with my old friends , the ones who were still using . After calling Patrick all sorts of names and kicking him out on his ass , she left , and I did n't hear from her for two days . When she returned she was pale and silent and spent a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had the baby anyway , and he was fine . I knew she 'd gone to one of her mother 's herbal doctors , but what could I say ? She would just scream that I had n't kept up my end of the bargain , and there was no reasoning with her . After those fights I usually had to rescue my books and papers from the sodden heaps on the lawn they accumulated into when Suchada threw them out the window . <p> Sister Michael stared at me evenly , as if she were reading my mind and knew I was thinking about spells and hexes and other things I should be leaving to forces she considered to be marshaled on the side of good . You could n't put anything over on that woman . Her cheeks were pink , skin perfectly clear-she practically glowed with health . " Hold on , " she said . " I 'll be off in a few minutes . " <p> When she reappeared in her street clothes-perfectly ironed , surprisingly close-fitting jeans , a maroon silk blouse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Styrofoam carton in it that could have held her lunch . She waited until we were outside to hand it to me . " This is the last time , " she said . " You understand that , do n't you ? " The look on her face let me know I had pushed her far enough . <p> I did n't peek in the bag until we had parted and I was on the long bus ride headed toward Lance . I felt like I had just gotten off that bus , and there I was right back on it . Since this was the last hurrah , as it were , Sister Michael had gone all out and arranged a whole sampler . There were at least twenty-five pills inside the carton , all different shapes and colors , even a few I did n't recognize . I emptied them into the bag and ditched the Styrofoam , then folded up the baggie tightly and put it into my pocket . It was all I could do not to skim a couple for my own rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down the pike from that direction , but I knew I was warm and dry compared to Lance . There was also a piece of pink phone-message paper folded in the bag , and I opened it and read in her perfect , Jesuitschool handwriting : <p> I am a follower of Jesus Christ but I know I have brought shame to His name many times . He does n't ask that I be perfect , but He does want me to be honest about my mistakes . And then , farther down the page , And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over His image , and over His mark , and over the number of His name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God . <p> I refolded the paper and put in my breast pocket . No need for Lance to see that . He 'd grown up as an Episcopal altar boy , and it still haunted him , that vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it overhead , bearing the burden for the entire congregation while the priest intoned the week 's reading . <p> I stopped by the reception desk and said Lance Potter , fully expecting the receptionist-a new one I 'd never seen before-to shake her head , meaning it was over , but she gave a bored nod and gestured with her chin for me to go ahead . On the way down the hall I saw Vini , my least favorite nurse . She must have gone into the profession to escape some terrible fate awaiting her as a beautiful young Indian woman , because she did n't have an ounce of compassion in her body . At least , not for humans . She did like animals , though , and was hiding some orphaned , worm-ridden kittens in one of the supply closets , feeding them and giving them medicine she 'd pilfered from the hospital . I had to pass the closet on my way to Lance 's room , and sure enough she was holding something carefully in her hands-a bowl of milk with bread floating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of two mangy little tabbies with infected eyes swollen shut with pus . Vini had n't heard me . As she put the bowl on the floor , she said in , for her , a cheerful tone , " Eat , you blind fools ! " I 'd hung my cane over my arm and tried to walk lightly , but she finally realized someone was there and straightened up quickly , tugging her uniform down over her lovely hips and turning around with an annoyed scowl . <p> I was n't totally convinced the staff would even know if Lance had died , so I opened the door slowly and peered around it . His body was still hooked up to the machines and the IV dripdripped away , stingily as ever . His eyes were half-open , and his teeth showed where his upper lip was pulled back a little , as if he were thinking about something slightly amusing . <p> " Lance ... , " I said , leaning over the bed . " It 's me . " I patted my breast pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something good for you in my pocket . Truly . " <p> I reached over and touched his face , just to make sure , and his cheek was hot and dry . He opened his eyes the rest of the way and looked at me then , and even tried to smile a little . " Can you swallow ? " I asked , but he made no response . <p> Lance had all his teeth capped when he got to Bangkok because , he said , it was so cheap , and afterward he showed them off with toothy grins and silly crude little jokes that the Thai teachers did n't quite get but laughed at anyway , not realizing he was making fun of them . He never said Thailand , but always " The Land of Smiles " - the slogan the Government had used to kick off the promotion for the Year of the Tourist-and when he said it , he oozed that grin in your direction . " Oh boy " Lance would say , shaking his head in supposed sadness , " another factory burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiles ! " Cluck-cluck went his tongue . What a shame . Tsk-tsk . <p> Lance was neat and clean-shaven and every day his shirts were ironed and bleached-he made the rest of us look like vagabonds when we came in with razor stubble , wearing the same rumpled shirt and tie as the day before . That and a lot of ass-kissing ensured him the best courses and the most profitable outside work . Most of the Thai teachers were on somewhat shaky ground as far as their English was concerned , even though we all taught in the Language department , and they badgered the foreign staff all day with minute questions of grammar and usage . When one pretty young Thai teacher asked Lance shortly after the Reagan polyp disclosure , " Could you say Ronald Reagan is a cancerous president ? " and he took it , it was too much-even though we 'd all voted absentee for our favorite write-in candidates . Most expats do n't see a contradiction between their rabid patriotism and the fact that they ca n't even stand their home countries enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance was the exception-he had no loyalty to anything or anyone , as far as we could determine . He started to answer , but Paul , a seventy-year-old Irish Republican pothead from Chicago , leaped from his chair and said , " Yes , you can , you can say that because in America you can say whatever you want about our leaders no matter how degrading or insulting it is , because it 's a free society , " and stomped out of the teachers ' lounge . A few days earlier , some lowly PM. had been thrown in jail under lese majesty for saying he wished he 'd been born a prince . When Paul was gone , Lance lifted his perfect eyebrows and shrugged at me , then turned his attention back to the teacher as though nothing had happened . She was smiling nervously , though she had certainly meant it as a jab . Still , no one was supposed to get that ruffled . <p> Does it seem odd that I 've remembered so clearly the details of this and other perfectly unremarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accompanied them , that I can pinpoint the beginning of wanting to make Lance tell me the truth to the moment I noticed he dyed his hair ? At the time I was puzzled by that myself , but I 've come to suspect , since the blurry string of nights listening to Lance whisper-stopping often to rest , trying to make do on the little puffs of breath his clogged lungs could provide-his recollections of childhood and relatively short adulthood , so that someone on earth would know what had meant something to him , that memory does n't weed out what 's important . Is n't it just as likely that we confer meaning on things because they were remembered ? Thus the most ordinary conversations and events-an outing with our parents , an item of clothing that at the time meant nothing more to us than a way to hide our bare and embarrassing skin from the world-become laden with meaning simply because they happened to lodge in our memories . And that which is forgotten is , necessarily , consigned to insignificance . <p> I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why Lance had remembered some occasion , say a car trip with his mother and brother where he and his brother had sung everything they wanted to say-Ro-oll down the win-do-ow pulee-eze , Mo-om , can we ge-et some ay-yus cream pu-lee-eze-until their mother had pulled over the car and sobbed behind the wheel , begging them to stop . It turned out , Lance added as an afterthought ( the reason for the trip having taken a back seat in his memory to the fact they 'd made their mother cry ) , that they were driving across country because their mother had packed them up and left their father in the middle of a hot summer night , after which Lance never saw his father again . <p> He remembered that he was at a restaurant called The Blue Bottle and that he was holding a glass of red wine in his hand when a plainclothes policeman approached the table , knelt down beside his chair , and told him he had to go home because his brother had shot himself in the head . He described how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said he remembered thinking that the stain would spread out forever until the purple pool engulfed him and the entire table . But he did n't remember whom he 'd been eating with , nor the substance of his final conversation with his brother , or when they 'd last seen each other . <p> Once , when I was at Lance 's apartment getting him some fresh clothes and checking his mail , I picked up a photo lying on the floor with the contents of a drawer that had been turned upside down by his boyfriend when he 'd ransacked the place . ( Whoever had done it , besides removing everything of value , had erased any trace of himself from the apartment . ) For some reason , probably fear of karmic retribution , the landlord had n't evicted Lance , though as far as I knew the rent was n't being paid . <p> The photograph was of a boy standing next to the burned-out shell of a small house , his hands stretched toward the picture taker and , on his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? expression . If it were n't for the expression , I would have taken the boy for Lance , their features were so similar , but on the back someone had written 196o , Joey after the fire . That night at the hospital , through a series of roundabout questions-I did n't want Lance to know his ex-boyfriend had trashed the apartment and scattered the remains of Lance 's life around on the floor-I managed to elicit the information that his brother had started a chimney fire by putting too much wrapping paper in the fireplace on Christmas morning , and the house had burned to the ground . When the firemen got there , they discovered that the house , part of a development , had been built on soil that was too soft and the foundation had settled and crushed the underground pipes . The house was ashes before they could locate another water source . I 'm positive Lance never would have told me this if I had n't worked him around to it with probing questions about houses and fires , yet he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his father had given him a rabbit for Christmas-which every year he 'd named Sarah , regardless of its gender-and every year , Sarah died long before the next Christmas rolled around . And he knew exactly where every one of those dead rabbits-at least the ones whose bodies had been recovered-was buried . Not " in the yard " or " near the woodpile " but under what kind of tree , how far from the house , whether the maimed little corpse was in a coffin-usually a shoe box-and so on . It strained credulity , except I could n't think of one reason why anyone would pretend to remember information like that if he really did n't . <p> It was n't until a few nights before Lance died that I understood the implications of this randomness : the world can never become an appreciably better place . A memory that does n't function to select significant events means one can never learn from one 's mistakes . Any changes for the better are coincidental and occur with more or less the same frequency as any changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cover headline screaming Can History Stop Repeating Itself ? , as if our own tiny , miserable lives were n't answer enough . <p> I pressed Lance 's hand and said , " Do n't try to talk , okay ? I 'll just sit here for a while . " He twisted his mouth like he was going to try to say something anyway . A feeding tube that was n't attached to any food dangled from his nose , waving slightly like an upside-down antenna when he moved his head . <p> I sat down and started grading papers , hoping just my presence was of some comfort . I was conscious of all those pills in my pocket , the promise of each one pressing its shape into my chest . Lance seemed to be beyond whatever comfort any pill might provide , and I was scared to put anything in his mouth he could choke on . Probably the most merciful thing would have been to grind them all up into powder , dissolve them in water , and shoot the paste down the feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed off for a few minutes , because when I woke up , I had the vague sensation of being watched . Lance 's lips had dried blood on them around the outsides and at the corners of his mouth , like he 'd been sucking on a blood Popsicle . When he parted them , I could see the inside of his mouth was white and spongy-looking from thrush . I 'd heard horror stories about it growing out of people 's mouths uncontrollably , like cotton candy . <p> " Can you understand me ? " I asked . " Do you want anything ? " <p> He looked over at the corner of the room , but there was nothing there . Then he whispered " ice " in a sort of water-logged voice that sounded nothing like him . <p> I went down the hall to the ice machine and came back with a plastic bag full of ice chips . He knew they were letting him die , if not actually speeding things along , but I had an overwhelming urge to say it out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice over it . <p> I pulled my chair up to his bed and put an ice chip between his lips , where it immediately melted . He must have had some kind of fever . " You know there 's things they can do for you , " I said . " I mean , more than here , anyway . Some bribing would smooth your way out of this . What 's your cash situation ? " I knew he must have some stowed away , since there was practically nothing to buy in the whole country and he had taught a lot of extra courses . <p> The immobility of the skin around his eyes confirmed he 'd already considered and rejected the issue . But at least by broaching the subject , I thought he might tell me what he wanted done with his money . I did n't even know if he had a will . Maybe he wanted it sent to his parents , but considering he had n't even-as far as I knew-told them he was in the hospital , I doubted it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to acknowledge that his dying was an inevitability now , and not a distant one . We had discussed his family often , but it was always in the context of events that had happened a long time ago . His parents and brother seemed frozen for him , stuck in some year of his early adolescence when their nuclear family had gone bust . I was also afraid that once we started on that conversation , he 'd tell me specifically what to do with his stuff and I would have to lie , pretend that it was all still there . Nod as he went through the whole list of who he wanted to have what-Paul had been envious of his good , heavy-duty American blender , for instance-and not have it show in my face that it was all gone . <p> I put another chip on his tongue . " Maybe you 'll come back as a millionaire , " I said , " and get your Star of Africa . I dreamed it last night . " I meant it as a joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized I had actually mentioned his death ; I felt terrible . I watched his face carefully to see how he took it . He had definitely heard me . His chest was moving up and down even more laboriously , and his cheeks had a waxy , bloodless sheen like a fake piece of fruit . " Lance ! " I said , a little too sharply . He was scaring me . " Do you want me to get one of those slaggy nurses ? What 's going on , can you breathe ? You 're freaking me out here . " He nodded , but I could almost hear the fluid sloshing in his lungs when he exhaled . " I 'm getting the nurse . " My voice sounded panicky . <p> He shook his head , and moved his arm a little so his palm was facing up , and I held onto it . <p> " I did n't mean it , " I said . " I 'm sorry .. . " Then for some reason , I no longer felt bad about mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll see to it you get a sky burial , the real kind , so you 'll be returned to the earth with a leg up on all these other wankers , " I said , trying to smile . I knew perfectly well they would burn his body before it was cold ; I 'd seen them whisking off other people from the AIDS wing , straight to the furnace . But maybe Lance did n't know it-after his first few days there , he 'd only left his room a couple of times . No sky burial , no being gently laid to rest on a mountaintop or a roof , with birds coming to peck your flesh off , and then when only your bones are left , having your loved ones grind them up into bone meal and roll it into little balls and put those out for the birds , too-so piece by piece you 're sort of returned to the air . Just some sullen-faced orderlies with gloves and masks shoving you into a burning tunnel . No , no matter what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed Lance 's chest was n't going down , it was stuck in an upward , inflated position , but I did n't know how long it had been since it had moved . I had been concentrating on his face , with those blurry unfocused eyes only receiving my gaze and not returning it , trying to gauge how much he understood of what I was saying . <p> I dashed out as quickly as I could without my cane , and when I got a nurse in there I could see immediately she did n't want to touch Lance or do anything to him , and she ran to get a doctor . When she came back with a tiny Indonesian man I 'd often seen bustling up and down the corridors , I grabbed his arm and demanded , " Is he dying , is he dying ? " but of course the doctor did n't know because he had n't looked at him yet . He gently slipped around me and placed his rubber-gloved hands on Lance 's chest , and the nurse turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please leave so we can work , you must get out now , " but I knew she was all bluster , she had no intention of doing anything to help , and even the doctor looked at her rather angrily . Still , there was no place for me right then , so I left , bundled out the door by the harsh one who did n't look strong enough to apply as much force as she did to my arm . <p> I stopped outside the door , now pulled shut behind me , and I could hear banging noises and the two of them speaking Thai . The doctor 's voice was smooth and cold . A woman and a child walked by without looking at me . " Lance , " I said to no one , " I did n't get to finish telling you . . " I kicked the door twice with my good leg , hard . It hurt like hell , but I needed a physical sensation of pain right then . " I think you 'll come back as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . One of those birds that can fly for seven years straight and never have to land on earth the whole time , not once . Would n't that be great ? " I was shouting , but neither the mother nor child , now at the end of the hall , turned around . <p> The same noises were still going on in the room when I left . I went out a rear door , afraid if I saw any of the nurses , I 'd let someone have it . The exit , a barely used one , gave onto a dirty little row of houses . I walked down the street , trying to stay out of the loud traffic of the main road for a few more minutes , grateful for the relative quiet in which to calm down . A jet-black dog lay in the gutter , its eye sockets hollow and its jaw unhinged . As I passed , I could have sworn it moved , made a little wriggle , but it must have been dead at least a week . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my eye a few seconds to distinguish in the mass of black hair the body of a cat-exactly the same color as the dog , with a thick , healthy black coat-chewing at the corpse , sending a little wave of motion through the dog that made it seem as though its front end were twitching . <p> The farang staff had a little memorial , as though they had cared deeply all along , and several of the Thai teachers who had worked closely with Lance came . Woody , who had started out life as a man but ended up as a woman , was there in three-inch heels , impeccably dressed as all the Thai ladies always were . She cried , taking off her glasses to wipe her eyes and blow her nose , which made me feel guilty because Lance and I used to poke fun at her sometimes just because she was such an easy target , with the name Woody and all . Woody was actually her old name ; as a woman she went by Susi . I think we both secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forcing them to let her teach again after her operation , but we never admitted it to each other . She read rather beautifully-where could she have come across it ? -a Wordsworth ode I had n't heard since high school : <p> What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now forever taken from my sight , <p> Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass , of glory in the flower ; <p> We will grieve not , rather find <p> Strength in what remains behind . <p> The other Thais were nodding , trying to pretend they understood a word of it , but it was obvious from the way they sort of snapped to attention when Susi sat back down that the content was a total wash . I wished Lance could have been there , he would have gotten a kick out of catching out those fakers , or at least a smirk . <p> It turned out Lance did have a will , though he had never mentioned it . The Viper told me a few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve ourselves lunch , under a tent at the annual end-of-summer departmental picnic . The picnic was held on one of the large , patchy fields on campus , but it was so hot everyone had gathered under the shade of one big tree , like a pride of lions . There was enough food for an army , of course , and the sleek , perfectly dressed faculty were busy gorging themselves . <p> The will had been found when Lance 's desk at school was cleaned out after he 'd died . Even the Viper was n't heartless enough to order it cleaned out beforehand . He had left all his cash-she did n't say how much , but rumor had it the amount was fairly substantial-to an organization that trained prostitutes for vocational jobs-making inlaid bracelets and earrings for tourists , gilding orchids , and so on . <p> I stood off to one side , watching the Viper pat her mouth carefully with a napkin . When she saw me looking , she waved me over . After digging around in her purse , she pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I donated his teaching materials to our library here . You can have these if you like . " As she passed the envelope into my hand I heard one of the few Thai men in the department , a foppishly handsome fellow with a fake British accent who spoke English even to his fellow countrymen , say to a brand new young teacher , " Yes , sick , you know the sick , terrible , is n't it ? " <p> I took it silently and turned my back on the Viper , opening the envelope as I walked away from the picnic , still in full swing . I 'd had about all I could stand . Inside were all the pictures Lance had had over his desk , most of them of people who were completely unfamiliar to me . I recognized several members of his family . I kept only one-of him and some dog or other , whose paw Lance was holding in his hand , and a very faded newspaper clipping about the Star of Africa , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , mounted in the royal scepter , held under lock and key inside the Tower of London . I dropped everything else into the garbage , hoping the Viper was watching . <p> At the edge of the picnic , I passed a cluster of women who had taken off their shoes and were standing barefoot , their brutally high heels abandoned nearby in the grass . I debated pointing out to the owner of a pair of expensive-looking green pumps that the toddler of one of her colleagues had just removed an enormous hunk of barbecued meat from his bulging cheek and was wringing it out over her shoe . Blissful in her ignorance , she was rubbing one perfectly pedicured foot over the other . But the boy smiled so happily , watching a trickle of gray juice run out of his closed fist and into her shoe , that I decided against it . Life is full of disappointments and rude surprises , I told myself . Let this be just one more . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
