Yes , Hef says , if it 's Kevin Costner , Jeff Goldblum , or Jack Nicholson you want to spot , try swinging by the Bunny boat , a 175-foot chartered yacht that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you go on the right night . " Zeh party eez Tuesday , " sneers the surly French bouncer . " Today eez Sunday . " + Actually , eez Monday , but no matter . Here at the 52nd Festival du Cannes , days and nights merge into one sybaritic blur . " Cannes is a very strange place , " says writer-director Tim Robbins , who attended with his critically acclaimed Cradle Will Rock . " There 's this great mixture of art and prostitution . " Photograph Photograph // What distinguished this year 's festival was the vast disparity between the two . For 12 days , attendees were subjected either to austere art tales of murder , incest , and no-good losers , or to desperate-sounding cell-phone conversations and meetings during which anything and everything was for sale . Everything , that is , except the best films in the competition , almost all of which were already owned by distributors , rendering the Croisette a pretty dull bordello for business . Sony made John Sayles ' meditative , coolly received Limbo , while Sony Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most enthusiastically received filmin January . The latest directorial efforts of a trio of indie-minded stalwarts-David Lynch , Robbins , and Spike Lee-were taken in advance by , of all companies , Disney . And Artisan had an unusually high profile at the festival thanks to marching in with the newest films from The Sweet Hereafter 's Atom Egoyan and Out of Sight 's Steven Soderbergh . With Egoyan , Lynch , Robbins , Sayles , and Jim Jarmusch in competition , it should have been shocking that not a single English-language film earned any recognition from the jury , which was headed by director David Cronenberg and included Jeff Goldblum , Holly Hunter , opera singer Barbara Hendricks , French playwright Yasmina Reza ( Art ) , French actress Dominique Blanc , and directors Doris Dorrie of Germany , Andre Techine of France , Maurizio Nichetti of Italy , and George Miller of Australia . But perverse prizes have become the Cannes norm ; there has n't been a truly popular Palme d'Or winner since 1994 's Pulp Fiction . Last year 's winner , the unloved Greek film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few theaters ( the runner-up , Life Is Beautiful , fared somewhat better ) . This year , it was the bleak Belgian drama Rosetta that earned the Palme d'Or and scored its star , 18-year-old Emilie Dequenne , best actress honors ; the movie was promptly picked up by Barry Diller 's newly formed USA Films . The runner-up was Bruno Dumont 's meandering L'Humanite , which also took two acting prizes despite a two-and-a-halfhour running time that caused a loss of sensation in many audience members ' lower extremities . Its Grand Jury Prize was booed by some at the Palais , while Jury members looked on in surprise . " I 'd gathered that the atmosphere there is sometimes volatile , " said Goldblum , " but I felt like we made our passionately arrived-at choices with as much integrity as we could . " And while festivalgoers were thrilled that Almodovar won best director , the Spaniard was ambivalent about going toe-to-toe with longtime friend Egoyan and his film Felicia 's Journey . " I do n't like competition , " Almodovar said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock made for unimpressive action all along the Croisette . Artisan shelled out more than $1 million for Jarmusch 's quirky competition entry Ghost Dog : The Way of the Samurai , starring Forest Whitaker as a hitman . But on the heels of such recent festival disappointments as The Castle , which was bought for $6 million last year at Sundance and has so far grossed just $298,000 , studios made only modest bids . " Studios are spooked , " said Trimark senior VP Dennis O'Connor , who bought the critically acclaimed British Beautiful People , a " Bosnian comedy , " for a sum in the mid-six figures . " The days of hyping how much you 've paid are over . " In fact , this year ; Cannes often resembled a fire sale . Universal even shopped around Wonderland , the crowd-pleasing , well reviewed drama from Welcome to Sarajevo director Michael Winter bottom that became a casualty of the restructuring of PolyGram and the demise of Gramercy . The studio found no takers .

Paramount Classics copresident David Dinerstein grabbed Sofia Coppola 's directorial debut , The Virgin Suicides , based on Jeffrey Eugenides ' 1993 novel about five sisters who end their lives , for a rumored $3 million , despite mixed reaction to the film . But overall , said Dinerstein , " I wish there were more films here I was excited about , and that the ones I had been excited to see before coming here were n't so disappointing . " No surprise , then , that one of Cannes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer . Julie Taymor , director of Broadway 's The Lion King , came to the festival to show distributors 14 minutes of her visually stunning , gruesome feature debut , Titus , based on Shakespeare 's Titus Andronicus and starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange . While DreamWorks , Miramax , and Fox Searchlight all expressed interest , the film , which is said to have gone $12 million over its original $10 million budget , was ultimately deemed too pricey for the shoppers on the Croisette . " They 're asking $18 million , " said one exec who considered bidding . " If they wanted $8 million based on seeing that amount of footage , it would be a gamble . But $18 million is n't a gamble-it 's a huge risk . " Still , Taymor felt confident that she 'd gotten the attention she needed . " Thank God people were interested , " she said . " When I was originally trying to get money , people were n't interested-they were frightened . " If the men who run the film festival , Gilles Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edgy fare , they did avoid picking some movies that seemed obvious entries in the competition , including Steven Soderbergh 's The Limey and Spike Lee 's Summer of Sam . While both directors had competed in Cannes before ( Soderbergh won the Palme d'Or for 1989 's sex , lies , and videotape , beating Lee 's Do the Right Thing ) , their entries this year were relegated to noncompetitive showings . Given some of the stolid fare that did make the cut , the relevance of the competition seemed at an all-time low . " The festival likes discovering new filmmakers or ambitious films by known directors , " said Soderbergh , whose star , Terence Stamp , was less gracious about The Limey 's exclusion . " When this did n't get into competition , " Stamp complained , " I thought , " I can forget Cannes now . " " What do you have to do to get a little attention in Cannes ? Try hawking a movie you do n't want . The usually attentionhoarding Miramax received the most chatter for Dogma , Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Affleck as homicidal angels . Before its first screening , distributors were clamoring to see the film that studio chief Harvey Weinstein was shopping , following his decision to buy the movie from his own company for $12 million and spare corporate parent Disney any protest grief . But its screening sharply divided potential buyers ; some eagerly canvassed audience members for reactions , while one studio exec summed up his opinion of the two-hourplus comedy by sticking his finger down his throat . As for Smith , the director was hoping that Weinstein might still release the film , perhaps via a one-time-only distribution company , as he did in the case of 1995 's controversial Kids . " Maybe there will be no backlash to duck , " Smith said , " and Harvey will be like , Yeah , we can probably put this out ourselves . " ' In the end , this year 's festival was less about immediate gratification in the business world than the immediate gratification of the next soiree .
