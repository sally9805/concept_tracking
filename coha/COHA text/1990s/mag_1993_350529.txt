When we meet him , C.S. Lewis ( Anthony Hopkins ) is giving rather smug lectures about the blessed necessity for suffering in our life : " Pain is God 's megaphone to rouse a deaf world , " he happily informs his listeners . <P> But what does Lewis  --  Oxford don , literary critic , fairy-tale writer , Christian apologist  --  actually know about the ordinary hurts of ordinary life ? Or , for that matter , about life as most people know it ? His beloved mother died when he was a child , and for decades he has lived in withdrawn bachelorhood . Snuggled up in a charming book-lined cottage with his brother Warnie ( the excellent Edward Hardwicke ) , he is sage but distant with his students , witty but somewhat abstract with his colleagues at the high table . <P> The man needs shaking up . And Joy Gresham ( Debra Winger ) is just the woman to do it . She 's an American , something of a poet , something of an imposition . But she 's also someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They meet for tea ; she and her eight-year-old son ( she 's in the midst of a messy divorce ) return for Christmas ; and eventually they settle in London . Bemusement soon gives way to concern . Lewis marries her so she can stay in England , but true love does not happen until she falls ill with cancer . A period of remission offers them the opportunity for an idyll . That brief happiness , followed by the pain of her death , does indeed " rouse " Lewis . But in ways deeper and more mysterious than he formerly gabbled about . <P> Shadowlands is , in essence , a true story , though screenwriter William Nicholson , adapting his own play , admits that given Lewis ' reticence , he has had to imagine much of what went on in the relationship with Gresham . And reticent is the word for Richard Attenborough 's film version . But that 's a virtue , not a defect , when your setting is English academia ( no one has more persuasively captured its manners ) and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the understated way that these people confront it , something very sweetly believable in their courtship and in the brief bliss they shared . Hopkins gets to do what he could not in The Remains of the Day , shake off repression , and Winger is awfully good too ; there is a steady pressure in her forcefulness that is never flashy or abrasive . They  --  the entire movie  --  are strong , unsentimental , exemplary .
