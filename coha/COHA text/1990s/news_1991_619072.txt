<p> ' US AGAINST <p> THEM ' <p> Editor  --  This is my second letter to an editor ever . I kept quiet while the media praised Magic Johnson for opening the eyes of heterosexuals that AIDS can happen to anyone . I do not agree with a large segment of the homosexual community regarding his admission as homophobic ( even though I believe it is in many cases ) . The bottom lines , and there are two , are that ( 1 ) regardless , it brought to light a much needed message ; and ( 2 ) we need to put the " us against them " to rest . <p> It will always be " us against them " even when the cure for AIDS is found . People 's fears , upbringing and religions , to name some reasons , will always separate us . The best we can hope for is that on a one-to-one basis we develop relationships within our straight friends and co-workers that show we are not that different . <p> However , as to your article ( Chronicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy Gay Ban , " I take a great deal of offense . I served on active duty in the military from October 1960 to October 1964 and received an honorable discharge . I am proud of my service time and was recognized as good at my classification . <p> At this time any gay person who would aspire to the U.S. Naval Academy and be in the top 10 percent of his class is more aware of and conscientious of AIDS and is more likely to do everything in his power to never spread the disease than his fellow classmen who are just beginning to come to terms with the fact that it " could happen to them . " Having been young once , I remember only too well how much these men think " It ca n't happen to me . " Do you really think that even with Magic 's admission that we have wiped out that attitude ? I think not . <p> BOB BRACKETT <p> San Francisco <p> LONG , COLD WINTER <p> Editor  --  The Bush recession continues to get worse . We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . <p> We assumed our governor , staunch Republican Pete Wilson , would have a program to get California out of the recession , after all he is our governor  --  wrong ! Wilson is evidently like Bush  --  they got their jobs and assume everyone else is OK . <p> Instead , Wilson announces he wants to raise $ 400 million in new taxes from renters , but calls the renters ' credit a subsidy . If Wilson is calling the renters ' exemption a subsidy , is he going after our homeowners ' exemption next ? <p> It looks like it will be a long cold winter , even in California . <p> BOB MULHOLLAND <p> Political Director <p> California Democratic Party <p> Sacramento <p> KEEP ON TRUCKIN ' <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle headline today says : " GM Reveals Drastic 4 Year Plan to Idle Plants , Cut 74,000 Jobs " ( Chronicle , December 19 ) . How ' bout that ! I hope you proud , smug , pleased with yourself Toyota , Honda and BMW owners keep right on truckin ' and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today  --  to deposit your unemployment checks . <p> Signed : a proud , pleased that I 'm doin ' my part and enjoying every mile of it  --  ' 91 Olds Cutlass owner . <p> SALLY BONVILLAIN <p> San Jose <p> WORKERS ' COMP REFORM <p> Editor  --  Insurance Commissioner Garamendi 's move to reduce the in surance industry 's request for an 11.9 percent increase to an unrealistically low 1.2 percent is akin to the false promises of Proposition 103 . Once again , insurers take the blame and are forced to pick up the losses for increases that reflect the spiraling legal , medical and fraud costs underlying insurance . <p> The costs for the medical-care portion of workers ' compensation claims have been increasing 15 percent in recent years , while the consumer price index has lingered around 3.5 percent . Vocational rehabilitation costs have been increasing at 30 percent annually . Medical costs now consume 46 cents of the claims dollar , while company administrative costs run about 13 cents on the dollar after payment of over $ 1 billion in dividends under the minimum rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing , particularly in Southern California , prompting some companies with high loss ratios to stop writing new business . Commissioner Garamendi justified his denial of the needed increase by citing the new fraud laws that go into effect next year and the expected cost savings to companies they will bring . Those savings are at least several years away and are not the largest portion of the increase sought by insurers . What California employers need for relief from high rates is meaningful reform of the workers ' compensation system by the Legislature to reduce costs , not political rate suppression that forces companies to lose income and withdraw from the marketplace . <p> PETER GORMAN <p> Alliance of American Insurers <p> San Francisco <p> HOUSING GAMES <p> Editor  --  As a life-long landlady , I feel that the law prohibiting rental discrimination against the unmarried is itself discriminatory . The profit motive dictates that the landlord who is serious about the best return on his investment will rent to two or more wage earners rather than a family and raise the rent 6 percent each year , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control does n't help low-income workers or families , because people already paying two-thirds of their income in rent ca n't even pay the incremental 6 percent . <p> The family is also handicapped in competing for housing because our society uses our taxes to enrich weapons technology instead of investing tax money in the health and education of the children we hope will grow up to do the work and help pay the taxes . The only thing families have going for them in the rental market is a conviction on the part of some landlords  --  not necessarily a religious conviction  --  that the only life worth living is one which affirms the duty of society to nurture and protect its children . <p> STEPHANIE MUNOZ <p> Los Altos Hills <p> DIRECTOR 'S WAKE-UP CALL <p> Editor  --  A lot of housing project people are calling for David Gilmore 's head . Mr. Gilmore can not dismiss the stark fact that he is responsible for the PP words  --  meaning : the public perception of him as a housing project director . He and he alone is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion about Mr. Gilmore is that he himself has dug himself into a very deep hole . Now he must accept the obvious outcome for doing so . Like the man who appointed Gilmore , he too has surrounded himself with " mean-spirited people . " <p> If the " healing process " has any hope of turning things around the Boston clan should be sent packing back to where they came from . We have more than enough talented people here in S.F. to fulfill S.F. 's needs . So  --  like the bedtime story of the big bad wolf , for Mr. Gilmore it is too late to pretend that he cares one iota about the sheep . The " wake-up " call has come . Sorry . It is too late to put on sheep 's clothing . <p> AL SMITH <p> San Francisco <p> LET FRANK DO IT , ART <p> Editor  --  For four years we 've put up with Agnos ' failed policies and impossible dreams . Finally , we voters had enough and voted him out of office . Now , in the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments to his friends and supporters as if he were passing out hot dogs at a political rally . Did n't he get it ? What is it going to take to get rid of this turkey ? Art , stop it ! Let Frank Jordan do the job we elected him to do . <p> ALLEN L. CHASE <p> San Francisco <p> THE LAND OF OZ <p> Editor  --  Jordan is the new mayor , the Niners are n't going to the playoffs and Bill Graham is dead . Next they 'll be telling me that Jerry Garcia is moving to L.A. and the Mime Troupe has gone Republican . Help ! I do n't think we 're in San Francisco anymore . <p> MARTY S. PATTERSON <p> San Francisco <p> MONTANA 'S CLOUT <p> Editor  --  It 's very hard to sympathize with Montana 's lawsuit challenging the loss of one of their two House seats . Poor babies , they claim that they will be underrepresented with only one congressman for their 804,000 population . This they say is much bigger than the 572,000 person " average " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every 402,000 people . In California , we share ( endure ? ) one for every 15 million or so . Overall , they have a lot more clout than we do . <p> Even with one House seat , Montana will have one national representative per 270,000 people . California has to get along with only about one per 550,000 . If Montana prevails , they will have one for every 200,000 people . Is that fair ? What 's their beef ? <p> ALAN BURNS <p> Los Trancos Woods <p> ( San Mateo County )
