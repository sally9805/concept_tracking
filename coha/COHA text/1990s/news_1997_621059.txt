<p> As a curry aficionado I 've eaten many different curries , including Vietnamese , Thai , Indian , Burmese and Malaysian . <p> But somehow , in my book , no one does curry better than the Thais . Regardless of the type  --  be it red , green ( my favorite ) , yellow , Massaman , Penang or others  --  Thai curries always seem more flavorful , bold and vibrant . <p> That 's why it 's often hard for me to eat curry and not think about the last time I savored it in Thailand . <p> It was , of all places , at the airport in Phuket , a lovely coastal town in the southern part of the country . My husband and I were waiting for our flight when we ran into a food vendor right outside the terminal . <p> Standing behind a low table adorned with bowls of bright-orange and saffron-shaded curries , she caught our eye and beckoned us to come closer . Under the blazing sun , beneath the swaying papaya trees , and even with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicious noodle stir-fry ) , we were still lured by her offerings . <p> We deliberated , for at least a split second , then ordered green curry  --  kaeng kiew wan . The vendor happily spooned some rice onto an aluminum plate , topped it with a generous helping of chicken curry , then tucked a tiny metal spoon underneath . The rice was soft , with the sweet nuttiness so distinctive of Thai jasmine rice . And the coconut milk-laced curry , soupy enough to soak up the rice but thick enough to coat the chicken , was at once rich , spicy and intensely aromatic with lemongrass , citrusy Kaffir lime zest and lime leaves . <p> Although the green chile pods and leaves were a bit fiery for my taste , it was much too delicious to stop . In fact , that particular plate of curry  --  served with such down-to- earth Thai charm , and eaten while standing under the hot sun ( there 's something magical about curries and tropical sun )  --  was the best I had ever experienced . <p> Truthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States exactly like some that I had in Thailand . But fortunately , I 've come very close . <p> There are two ways to go about making Thai curries : Either use store-bought paste or make it from scratch . If you asked me , I 'd recommend trying both , probably in that order , and then decide for yourself . <p> I 'd say making your own only if fresh spices and herbs are available . Otherwise , go with ready-made pastes that come in plastic tubs ( such as Mae Ploy ) , which are better than the canned products . ( People in Thailand , it should be noted , buy their curry pastes freshly made from the market . ) <p> As a general rule , use the paste sparingly , no more than two to three tablespoons at a time , as it can be quite hot and pungent . Once open , it will last about three months if refrigerated . <p> If you decide to use ready-made paste , do what some of my Thai friends do . Give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limes , cilantro roots , galangal , chiles , etc . Using a mortar and pestle , grind and mush the herbs then add to the store-bought paste . <p> In today 's recipes , I 've adapted that clever technique , just in case you 're too busy to make your own paste but still want to enjoy a great tasting homemade-style curry . <p> But if you 're a purist or just want to experience curry paste-making ( some claim working with a mortar and pestle is therapeutic ) , try the fresh green curry paste recipe . But remember , there 's much more to curry than spices alone . It 's about pulling all the ingredients together  --  combining them in a such way that the flavors become harmonious yet also distinctive in their own right  --  that really counts . <p> Sorry , but I did not include the hot Thai sun in the recipes . Perhaps a dash of imagination can help . <p> FRESH GREEN CURRY PASTE <p> INGREDIENTS : <p> * 1 teaspoon whole cumin seed <p> * 1 tablespoon coriander seed <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemongrass <p> * 1-inch piece galangal , minced <p> * 7 Kaffir lime leaves , cut into slivers , or 2 teaspoons grated lime zest <p> * 7 jalapeno or serrano chiles , seeded and chopped <p> * 10 green Thai bird chiles , or more to taste , chopped <p> * 4 garlic cloves , sliced <p> * 3 shallots , sliced <p> * 1/2 cup chopped cilantro , including stems , leaves and roots <p> * 1/2 tablespoon shrimp paste ( see note ) <p> * 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt <p> INSTRUCTIONS : Place the cumin , coriander and peppercorns in a small skillet and dry- roast over medium heat , shaking the pan until the seeds are lightly toasted , about 2 or 3 minutes . <p> Transfer to a mortar or spice mill and grind to a fine consistency .
