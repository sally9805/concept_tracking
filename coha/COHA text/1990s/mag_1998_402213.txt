Margaret . Ray , the woman who stalked David Letterman , followed a lonely path that ended in suicide // In Sunday , Oct. 11 , with a crisp hint of autumn in the air , 20 grieving friends gathered by a reservoir near Crawford , a small town in southeastern Colorado . Forming a circle and holding hands , they each in turn shared a memory of Margaret Mary Ray , who had lived on and off in the area for more than a decade . A soul wracked by years of mental illness , she had ended her tortured life the week before by throwing her body under a train . " By the time it got to my turn , I busted out crying , " says Steve Haley , a local juniper-berry farmer who befriended Ray 14 years ago . " So much pain . " Meanwhile her family had spread her ashes at Needle Rock , a nearby scenic landmark that was " one of her favorite places , " says Haley . " Very spiritual . " Few other Americans mourned Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letterman 's stalker had killed herself at age 46 on Oct. 5 , recognized the name . This was the bizarre , seemingly harmless woman who from the late ' ' 80s into the ' ' 90s was lost in a delusion that the late-night host was as infatuated with her as she was with him . Ray first made headlines in 1988 , when , apprehended after stealing Letterman 's Porsche , she told police she was Mrs. Letterman and claimed that her son Alex , now 14 , was the television star 's son . Over the years , she broke into Letterman 's $1.2 million home in New Canaan , Conn. , at least four times and was found on the property or in the neighborhood on more than a dozen occasions . As Letterman , 51 , said in a statement , her death marked the " sad end to a confused life . " Beyond her pathological fixation with Letterman and , more recently , retired shuttle astronaut Story Musgrave , 63 , little was publicly known about the mother of five , other than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression ) had landed her repeatedly in jail and apparently left her increasingly isolated from her family . But there was more to Margaret Ray than that . " She was always strange , " says Haley , 49 , who identified his friend 's mangled body at the suicide site . " But she was one of the kindest , gentlest people . " In an Oct. tor Peter Slatin , who knew Ray through artist Tom Ray , her surviving sibling , recalled a woman once " light-spirited and intense , a loving mother . " A daughter , Anna-Lisa Johanson , of Washington , D.C. , said in a statement that Ray was destroyed by a mental illness " just as deadly and just as painful as cancer . And unfortunately we are not at the point in our society . . . where we understand this disease and treat those who have it with the compassion they deserve . " Photograph In court last August in Osceola County , Fla. , a medicated Ray answered that she felt better . " I also feel competent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 ) " the dominant figure in my life . " Photograph Ray ( a majorette in 1970 ) " was warm and loyal , " says a high school friend . Photograph " When Ray stepped onto the tracks ( outside Hotchkiss , Colo. ) " there was no way the train could stop " , says Sheriff William Blair . // Yet recently authorities had tried to intervene after Ray , for the most part transient , went to Florida in pursuit of her other celebrity fixation , Story Musgrave . Arrested in September 1997 for trespassing on Musgrave 's property in Kissimmee , Ray kicked one Osceola County jail guard and threw a cup of urine at another " Margaret knew she needed medication , " says her friend Terry Ellingson , a bookkeeper in nearby St. Cloud . Put on an antipsychotic drug , Haldol , and sent to a Miami facility in March 1998 , Ray emerged " rational and well-behaved , " says assistant public defender Ken Komara , her lawyer . But as Judge Roger McDonald observed before releasing her in August , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His words proved prophetic . Ray , who was cunning enough to engineer a meeting with Musgrave in 1994 by pretending to be a reporter , chose not to cooperate with relatives or specialists . " She was able to sit down with a doctor , take a deep breath and convince him he was the crazy one , " says a family friend . After leaving prison , Ray trusted instead in the kindness of her friends in St. Cloud and , later , back in Colorado , where she got by on disability . Before long " she had gone off the drug , " says Haley . Two weeks after suspending the medication , she lay down before a coal train as it chugged past Hotchkiss , near Crawford . The suicide note she left , according to Delta County sheriff William Blair , " said , Please contact " and gave a name and a number That 's it .

" She was popular , " says Laurie Poska Frank , 46 , a classmate from Grayslake Community High , where Ray made the honor roll . " She was always ahead of everyone else , the first to wear a miniskirt . " Frank adds , " She always seemed to be searching for something . " It was after she graduated in 1970 that her life began to unravel . Her parents divorced . ( Slatin says her father , now deceased , was an alcoholic ; her mother today lives in Connecticut , where she has custody of Alex . ) Then two brothers , Bill and David , committed suicide two years apart . Both , Ray later told a psychiatrist , were schizophrenic . According to Frank , Ray went to Marquette University in Milwaukee to study nursing , then dropped out in her sophomore year to marry . But her mental health began to decline by her early 20s , according to a family friend . By 1982 , wrote Slatin , Ray and " four happy kids " were on a prolonged visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage was ending , and her moods grew unpredictable . The children were sent to live with their father . Ray , staying in New York City , " was easy pickings for manipulative men , " says Slatin . At some point she married again . A fifth child , Alex , was born around 1984 , then she and the baby sank further into poverty . Photograph Ray was convinced Story Musgrave ( in 1996 ) impregnated her " telepathically. " // In 1988 , Ray became fixated on David Letterman . " She saw him on television one day , " says Haley . " She was spellbound . " On two occasions within 24 hours , Letterman himself discovered Ray on his premises and quietly phoned the police . Between 1989 and 1994 , she was convicted on trespassing and related charges in five separate trials , serving a total of 31 months . Letterman , who testified against her in 1990 , " was n't vindictive , " says public defender Jim Ginnochio , who represented Ray . " He wanted her to get help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star , " got dressed up , " says Ginnochio . " She wore peach-colored gloves . " ) Freed , Ray bounced from place to place . " She was able to get around the country with almost no money , " says the family friend . " She had figured out how citizens ' band radio worked . Truckers who were sympathetic to her would call ahead and arrange rides . " By now she was one of the few recognizable figures among the nation 's estimated 175,000 homeless mentally ill . In March 1997 , when she was picked up in North Fond du Lac , Wis. , for stealing a cup of coffee in a diner , Lt. Bill Lamb realized whom he had in custody when she complained , " You are bigger simpletons and more incompetent than David Letterman ! " After Ray was arrested at Story Musgrave 's home last year-she walked 30 miles from Orlando in the dark , then hosed herself down naked and screamed his name-she told a psychiatrist she was known as a " celebrity stalker . " Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Jeff Rassler , a St. Cloud locksmith and boyfriend of Ray 's friend Terry Ellingson . " Now she 's gone . She could n't live as a normal person . " The day after her death , the couple received a package Ray had mailed from Colorado on Sept. 29 . Inside , along with family photos , were four notes , including one to her oldest son , Jacob , in which she told him she remembered him as a remarkable child and knew he 'd continue to be remarkable after she was gone . She signed it , " Love , your mother , Margaret Mary Ray . " Photograph " She would n't hurt anyone , " says Steve Haley ( with his dog Wolf , who let Ray stay at his Crawford home . " She was just Margaret . " Author Affiliation Tom Gliatto Vickie Bane in Colorado , Eric Francis in New Canaan , John T.
