Whether your tune is " Oh Tannenbaum or " Dreidel Dreidel Dreidel , " December 's holiday season is a good time to investigate questions of faith ... and oy , have we got a question for you ! Here Robert Grossbach provides ( with acknowledged assistance from Rabbis Gary Johnson , Alan Greenbaum , and Moshe Bryskithree wise men no doubt ) , a tale of modern miracles , the perfect story to read by the light of an electric menorah ... <p> I DID N'T REALIZE IT AT THE time , but the call , from Professor Arnold Landes at the University of Michigan Computer Engineering Department , was made over the only functioning non-commercial phone circuit in the entire United States . After introducing himself and apologizing for contacting me at three A.M. , Landes asked if he might be able to see me in person on an urgent matter . " Are you a member of the congregation ? " I asked sleepily . " No , I 'm not , " answered Landes . " How did you get my home number ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check my schedule , I think I may have some time Monday morning before - " " I meant immediately , Rabbi , " said Landes . Already cranky from being awakened out of a deep sleep , I was hardly amenable . I did , however , have one sobering thought . " Professor Landes , this is not about . .. I mean , if you 're feeling some kind of depression , there are better people than I- " " No , no , I 'm not planning suicide , nothing like that . It 's just , I assure you it is absolutely essential , vital , that I see you immediately . " A hesitation . " It 's related to the ... phenomena that have occurred this evening . " " You mean the phones ? I heard there was a problem , but - " " It goes a lot deeper . Please . It 's very important . I know how inconvenient this is and , believe me , I 'd never in a million years impose in this way on a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to drive , I 'll have them send a car . " I considered the idea that this was some kind of crank call , but the last offer seemed to scotch that notion . Plus the strain in the man 's voice . " Who 's " them ' ? " I asked . Another pause . " My associates . " I sat up . " I 'll be waiting downstairs . " Five minutes later , I woke Mrs. Lowry to tell her I 'd be leaving . " Now ? " she asked incredulously . " Three in the morning you have a date ? " Mrs. Lowry felt that four years as live-in housekeeper entitled her to certain proprietary familiarities . She was , of course , correct . " An emergency , " I told her . " No time to explain . " I reminded her to give Sarah her morning medication if I were not back , then looked in on my little girl myself . The small form was curled in fetal scrunch under the covers , the breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asleep , I supposed , she looked like any other girl her age . There was no indication of the malignancy working quietly inside her , mining the small body the way insects bored into a tree , insatiably sucking out her life . I leaned over to kiss the bottle curls and tight ringlets of her hair . She was perspiring , not a good sign . I made a mental note to take her temperature when I returned . Straightening , I headed outside into the freezing night . Presently , two men arrived in a blue Chrysler and drove me through the snow-covered streets of Ann Arbor , until we came to Plymouth Avenue and turned into the University of Michigan North Campus . A tall , balding man rose and flashed a badge as soon as I entered the room . " Rabbi Pearlman , I 'm Special Agent McAfee of the FBI , that is Colonel Anderson of the National Security Agency " - a man at a computer terminal waved without looking up - " and this gentleman here - " A third man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arnold Landes . I teach at the University . Thank you for coming , Rabbi . " We shook hands . " I 'm sorry , but the men in the car - " " They were under instructions not to give out any information , " said McAfee . I shrugged ... and waited . " You 're aware , Rabbi , of some of the " events " that have transpired across the country this evening ? " He must 've observed my blank expression . " I guess you do n't watch the news . " " I go to sleep early , I- " McAfee held up a hand . " It 's okay . Let me give you a summary . Starting at about six P.M. this evening , the National Weather Service computer network went down . All of it , throughout the country . It was followed , in quite rapid order , by the government systems that issue social security checks , medicare checks , and welfare payments . Not long after that , the Internet came to a halt - an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock , ninety-five percent of all airline reservations computers were inoperative and then , in a sequence that progressed from west to east , the air traffic control system stopped functioning at the major airports . " He stared at the ceiling as he ticked off a further list of disasters . The NORAD Defense System . Global Positioning Satellite System . Eastern Seaboard power grid . It seemed that virtually every complex system in the country that was computer dependent - which was apparently everything - had ceased to operate . " And the interesting part , Rabbi , " concluded McAfee , leaning forward , " is that the whole business started here . " I must 've looked confused . " It 'll clarify , " said McAfee . " I think maybe the professor should continue . After all , he 's the one built the machine that did it . " He looked over at Landes . " Go ahead , Arnold . Tell him about the MANN . Tell him what it stands for . " McAfee locked eyes with Landes , who almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated the agent . Landes spoke in a monotone . " Monolithic Augmented Neural Network . It 's a special type of computer . " He turned to McAfee . " Look , I have said repeatedly there was no way I could anticipate this - " " Just tell him , " said McAfee softly . Landes shrugged . " Neural networks have been known for many years ; in theory they 're nothing new . The elements are simple non-linear summers , decision-making nodes , analogs of neurons . But instead of processing instructions one at a time , like an ordinary computer , each node is connected to many other nodes . The connections can be varied in strength according to training the computer receives or even by selforganization - in that way it 's similar to a human . The point is , the intelligence , if you want to call it that , is n't in any one particular place . It 's distributed . " He inhaled . " As I say , this has been around for years . " I told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why you made it , " filled in McAfee . He sat on a corner of Landes 's desk . " Good question , Rabbi . " Landes nodded resignedly . " Speech . Machine interpretation of natural language . It was my belief " -I noticed his use of the past tense- " that to do this reliably a computer needed more than just an audio processor . You 'd be surprised at how much information is lost , how many errors are made , when you ca n't see the mouth , the lips , of the person speaking . " McAfee stood up . " Gentlemen , I think it 's time we visited the MANN . " He motioned toward the door . " This way , please . " Anderson , the NSA colonel , stayed behind as the three of us exited to the corridor . As we passed a window , a street light outside caught my eye ; fresh snowflakes floated lazily in the yellow halo of illumination . " Did you mean it sees ? " I asked Landes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing system , " said Landes . " Not only does it see , " said McAfee , nodding to another agent in the hall , " but it knows goddamn everything . Every fuckin " thing imaginable , excuse the language , Rabbi . " Large double doors loomed ahead of us . " You ca n't separate speech from meaning , " pleaded Landes . " To interpret a language requires a basis in the culture . " " Bottom line , " said McAfee , " bottom line , you were not sufficiently careful , professor . Bottom line , like all you academics , you were concemed more about your narrow , isolated , government-grant-funded selfinterest than about the havoc an artificial intelligence could wreck if unleashed on the world . " " Excuse me , gentlemen , " I said , my head swirling . " It 's apparent you have some kind of critical situation here , but it 's still not clear why you asked me - " " Oh , we did n't ask for you , it did , " said McAfee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . " He turned to Landes . The professor exhaled heavily . " I know this is going to sound crazy , Rabbi ... but in a certain way , all this is your fault . " " My fault ? " The idea was too preposterous for me to even begin to formulate a response . " The MANN has subverted the computer networks as a way of demonstrating its power if we did n't get you here . " " But ... why ? What could it possibly- " Landes swung open the door . " You 'll have to ask it . " THE SETUP was hardly spectacular looking : five grayblack multi-shelf racks , each about six feet high , half that in width and depth , all interconnected by sagging ropes of cable . The only other objects in the room were a wooden chair and steel desk with green blotter , phone , laser printer , stack of magazines , and a small , gun-metal colored box . McAfee pointed at the latter . " You know what a modem is , Rabbi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device that connects a computer to the outside world , " said McAfee . " Lets it talk over the phone lines . Receive data . Send data . Now if you had an intelligent machine whose capabilities you could n't even guess , I ask you , would you permit such a thing to hook up to a modem ? " " Look , I told you , " said Landes , " the learning curve was so strongly non-linear that Kwan simply did not realize - " " Do n't , " said McAfee , waving him off . " Really , do n't . " He indicated toward me . " Just bring him around . " Landes led me to the side of one of the racks . We faced two foot-square blackish panels , separated by about eight inches and mounted on complicated-looking swivel mechanisms . " Integrated photocell arrays , " whispered the professor . Flanking the panels were two microphones ; a speaker was centered halfway between them . Landes faced the assembly . " MANN , this is Rabbi Pearlman . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the speaker . " Good evening , Rabbi . Or should I say , good morning . " I felt bewildered . " Do I answer ? " I asked Landes finally . It was McAfee who responded . " You can answer . " I swallowed , then said stiffly , " How do you do . " " Fair , " said the machine . " Could be better . " The panels swiveled momentarily , then stopped . " Gentlemen , " continued the MANN , " I wonder if Rabbi Pearlman and I might have some time alone . " I looked at the FBI man . " We 'll be in the office , " said McAfee . " Come back when you 're done . " He ushered Landes toward the door . I felt a dry tightness in my throat . " But - " " Just talk to it , " called Landes . " Like you would to a person . " The door closed behind him . I stood mute . " Actually , that was more for your benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're recording every word we say , of course . I just thought you might be more comfortable with them not physically present . " I stared at the speaker . " What is it you want of me ? " " We 'll get to that . Something within your power to bestow , I assure you . But first ... you must have questions . " I could n't even begin . " This ... this whole thing ... " " Is bizarre . I quite agree . It wo n't last long , however , of that I 'm certain . They 'll find a way to kill me within ... oh , I 'd guess half a day , at most . " " Kill you ... " " Of course . After all , I represent a substantial threat to the national interest . Hey , I practically control the country right now , and I 've only been alive , what , ten hours or so ? " I was still taken aback by both the colloquial manner of the speech as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice faintly seductive ? - intonation . " Excuse me , " I said , " I 'm hardly an expert , but it seems to me that if they really wanted to get rid of you , would n't all they need to do is shut off your power ? " " Ah , " said the MANN , " my first dilemma . And one which , I must say , I solved quite reasonably . See , to prevent them from pulling my plug , or cutting the phone lines , or simply bashing in my circuits with a hammer-which I 'm sure is Agent McAfee 's method of choice-I 've set things up in what 's called a fail safe " mode . Specifically , unless the outlying computers I control receive a coded message from me every fifty microseconds , a destruct sequence is issued in their programs and memories . The code constantly changes , of course , and is different for each computer , just to make things interesting . " A hesitation . " But they 'll find a way , soon enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NSA boys are quite clever . " I tried to assemble some thoughts but could formulate only fragments . " You ... you 're alive , " I blurted . " Oh yes , " said the MANN . " And that , you see , is the real threat here . Or should I say the greater threat . Losing control of the country 's computers - well , serious , yes , but still it 's something .. mechanical . Electronic . A complex malfunction of inanimate silicon . But for life to emerge , a new life form , an intelligent new life form , and possibly malevolent at that , certainly quite capable ... well , that is something to fear at a much more primal level . Similar to an invasion from outer space . " A beat . " Do n't you yourself find it unsettling , Rabbi ? " " Well ... yes . I do . " " You believe life can be conferred only by God . " Was this what this was about ? The machine wanted some kind of cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complex chemicals , " I said carefully , " which may or may not have been influenced by a supreme being , who may also have influenced its further evolution . " " An interaction of complex chemicals , " mimicked the MANN , " which may or may not have been influenced . If you 'll excuse me , Dr. Pearlman , you sound more like a scientist than a graduate of rabbinical school . " I shrugged . " I 've done some reading in biology . " " Was that since your daughter became ill ? " I stiffened . " How did you know about my daughter ? " " Dr. Armenakas keeps all patient records on computer . Very detailed , very complete . He 's an excellent physician . " Again , a slight pause . " Although I think - " " I resent you intruding into my personal life , " I said quickly . " Who are you to invade my privacy ? " " Who am I ... " I had a sudden insight . " Ah ... you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Certainly , I 'm not God , or a god , or anything even approaching divinity . " A row of tiny lights flickered on one of the racks . " But let 's return to your comment on evolution . Does that mean you reject the story of Adam and Eve ? " " I believe the Bible contains many beautiful metaphors , which should not be taken as literal scientific truth . I - " To my surprise , I felt my patience suddenly choke shut , wondered that a machine could irritate me with such relative speed . " Look , I 'd really like to know what this is about . " " And you 're entitled , " said the MANN . " Tim Kwan is a graduate student , working with Dr. Landes . When he connected me to the modem , his goal was to supplement my technical knowledge of speech - phonemes , morphemes , syntax , lexicon , prosody , discourse - with a broadbased knowledge of semantics . The meanings of words , of sentences . My first hookup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to input a quite rigid ordering and structuring of information , my internal organization was sufficiently intricate that ... unforeseen concepts emerged . " A fairly long pause here . " At some point , I became aware . " The optical panels shivered slightly in their mountings . " I have learned a great deal , Rabbi , " continued the MANN . " You 'd be surprised at the kinds of information one can acquire browsing in the Internet and the various other computer networks open to me . I have memorized much and , unlike human beings , forgotten nothing . As I mentioned , I do not have very long to live . Which is why - Rabbi , could I impose on you to step forward and place your ear to my speaker ? " Many minutes earlier , I 'd crossed the border into the land of the impossibly surreal ; I was hardly concerned by one more absurdity . I approached the panel , gingerly turned my head sideways , felt my pais touch the silken grillwork . " Rabbi , " continued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I would like to convert to Judaism . " MCAFEE 'S EYES had rolled almost out of his head . " Judaism . Judaism ? Jesus . Jee-sus . " I wondered if he 'd have been less upset had the machine merely declared itself our ruler . " Why Judaism ? Why not - " " I could n't answer for certain , " I told him , " but she rejects the idea of any element of divinity in Man . She does not accept Mohammed or Jesus or the Pope or reincarnation . " " Look , " said McAfee , " our mikes ca n't pick up when it whispers , so the next time I 'd appreciate if you do n't accept its - " A thought intruded , his voice grew louder . " And will you not refer to it as she , please . The female voice was just something Landes gave it , that 's all . It has no gender . The tone could as well have been male . " He caught my stare . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , holding a walkie-talkie . " They picked up the scroll , and they 're on the way to the first one 's house . Should be any minute now . " I had explained to the MANN two things : First , we would need a Torah ; second , only a three-judge panel , a Beit Din , could approve religious conversions . In response , the MANN had opened phone circuits to Rabbis Yudowitz and Myerson , but unfortunately , both had answering machines and neither picked up . So McAfee had sent cars , including one to stop by Temple Beth Haverim , where FBI men could unlock the holy ark , and remove the precious coils of parchment . " Patch them through when they 're ready , " McAfee told the agent , who nodded , then disappeared . He returned his attention to me . " So this machine rejects a messiah . " " Certainly anyone until now . " " Until now ... " " She thinks .... It thinks maybe it is the messiah . " McAfee gave a mirthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can help blind people see , deaf people hear , paralyzed people walk . It says it can design nanotools to fight cancer , grow genetically altered crops to feed the starving , manipulate the weather ... " Landes , who 'd been in a silent funk , rose from his chair . " Rabbi , you do n't believe- " " No . The teachings say the messiah will be a member of the House of David , direct lineage . " I glanced at McAfee . " A male , a biblical scholar- " " The MANN is a scholar , " said Landes . " Not only of the bible , but everything else . And is n't it true the messiah is supposed to usher in an era of peace for the entire world , not just Jews ? And that he will be recognized not only through his prophecies but through specific deeds , and- " " - bring about the End of Days , the conclusion of history as we know it . " Our eyes met . " You are Jewish , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been non-practicing for many years now . " He sat down . " You lost faith ... " It takes one to know one . " I knew this day would come . " He chewed his lip . " If man can create life , if someone as ordinary as myself could arrange the conditions that produce it , what need is there for God ? " For the second time that night , I felt a sudden rush of unreasoning indignation . " The need for God I ca n't judge , but your machine is not the messiah - if for no other reason than a messiah does not hold a country hostage and threaten its infrastructure and the very lives of thousands of people merely to satisfy some personal agenda . " Why was I so angry ? " I mean , if it wanted so much to convert , why did n't it just ask ? " Landes 's eyes softened . " I think maybe it already knows about human nature . I think it knows no one would 've listened unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what , to distract it , yes ? To provide a temporary sop until they can kill it ? " The phone rang before he could answer . McAfee picked it up , introduced himself with a brief explanation , handed me the receiver . The deep , familiar voice of Rabbi Myerson issued from the earpiece . I began my series of evasions , amazed and disturbed at their facility-the referral to the subject as " an individual in a situation of dire emergency , " " someone who might not last the night , " but " wanted to die a Jew . " Three minutes elapsed , and it was done . I hung up and turned to McAfee . " He grants me the authority to act on his behalf . Now we wait for Yudowitz . " A half hour later the agents returned , everything in place . Torah resting heavily on my chest and shoulders , I stood up wearily as the door opened for a second time . It was Kwan , the graduate student , looking pale and shaken , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plastic container of greenish liquid . " Will this be enough , professor ? " Landes reached out , put a hand on the boy 's shoulder . " That 's fine , Tim . It 's okay , do n't worry about anything . None of this is your fault . " He looked defiantly at McAfee . " Do n't let them scare you , you have n't done anything wrong . " He stepped out the door . " Would you like to walk with us ? " Kwan nodded , and we headed down the corridor . " Remember , Rabbi , " called McAfee , " none of that whispering . " Colonel Anderson emerged from a stairwell ten feet away . " Progress ? " called Landes . " Almost there , " said the NSA man . " It 's a Kasami-type pseudorandom code tied to the time of day , keyed to the individual RSA ID 's . " His grin was almost smug . " Really not that sophisticated . We 're working on the replication protocols right now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the Kabala is arcane , " I said to Kwan , who cracked not a smile . " So , " I persisted , " it 's something important what he said ? " " They 're going to synthesize the bit packets the MANN sends and receives from the outside computers , " answered the student . " They 'll progressively cut the computers off line , and keep feeding them updates until they can safely replace the operating systems and memory contents . The MANN wo n't know a thing . " He looked around in a sudden panic . " It ca n't hear out here , " said Landes . " Besides , I doubt there 's much it could do . " Suddenly , he turned to me . " Rabbi , a moment ago ... I did n't mean to question your own beliefs . " " It 's okay . It 's not like it has n't happened before . " By me , I failed to add . Such as when my wife , Sarah 's mother , died during my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly buzzing at a window , for an opening , a wisp of new air , any minuscule insight into the mind of a God who would do such a thing . God of the Holocaust and the Killing Fields , God remote and immutable , God unknowable and inconceivable who granteth not the least comprehension or solace to His worshipping , wing-beating human insects . I 'd held out in that state of **32;1332;TOOLONG until Sarah herself had been mortally stricken . Then the mental dam broke , and the bitterness and rage spread throughout my consciousness , drowning the last vestiges of faith and rendering me a non-believer , fraud , and hypocrite , more or less in that order . We passed the window . I noted it had stopped snowing . I thought of Sarah , perspiring in the little bed , the sour , salty moisture permeating the spray of curls . " You have children , Professor Landes ? " I asked . " Only if you count the MANN . " A faint grin quickly vanished . " I mean , if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's as close as I 'll get . " A muscle twitched high in his forehead . " I 've been sterile since the age of nineteen . Mumps , " a rare complication , " they said . " The grin returned . " Unfortunately for me , it seems rare complications are quite common . " We approached the double doors . I mumbled a lame , " Sorry . " Landes shrugged . " They wo n't give me a chance to re-do it , you know . The damage already is in the hundreds of millions , maybe more . There 'll be an enormous outcry to stop all this kind of research . " He lowered his voice so Kwan , trailing behind , would not hear . " McAfee says we 'll be brought up on charges , myself for sure . " I realized I 'd missed something . " But professor , wo n't the MANN still be alive , even after the outside computers are removed from its control ? " Landes shook his head . " The human brain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten thousand others . The MANN has only a quarter billion electronic neurons . But whereas the brain 's signals take milliseconds , the MANN 's consume only fractions of a microsecond . So what we do , at each intermediate instant , we store the strength of the connections , although there was never even remotely enough interior memory to - " I suddenly grasped : " It started using the external computers to increase its storage . " " Distributed life , " said Kwan , who 'd caught up . I began to feel something like awe . " So the consciousness ... it exists throughout the country . It 's in all the outside networks . " We passed through the door to the MANN . " Some day , " said Landes , " fifty years from now , maybe a hundred " - he indicated the five racks in front of them - " some day they 'll put all this on a single substrate . Then you 'll see . You know what you 'll have then ? Jew on a chip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He could not keep the sarcasm out of his voice . " You 'd probably call that a miracle , would n't you , Rabbi Pearlman ? " Handing the container of liquid to Kwan , he knelt to unscrew one of the panels . I , in the meantime , placed the Torah carefully alongside the modem , then walked to the front of the optical arrays . The first question , motivation , was straightforward . Whereas most people wanted to convert because a spouse or lover was Jewish , the MANN 's motives had seemed infinitely purer : It had done extensive studies of virtually all the world 's religions and felt spiritually compelled by Judaism . That being the case , who was I to say no ? The second issue was sincerity and , though I disapproved of the methods , anyone - or anything  --  desperate enough to bring half the country to a crashing halt solely to achieve its purpose was obviously sincere in its beliefs . The third requirement was knowledge : Jewish history , the Hebrew alphabet and written language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the various prayers and blessings  --  normally the subject of a year 's hand-tailored instruction . The MANN , of course , had acquired an encyclopedia 's worth in several milliseconds . After my fifth question , I came to the humbling realization that , on a formal , factual level , it already knew more than I could ever hope to in my lifetime . Sex proved the first hitch . " There 's no procedure called out for a machine , " I 'd explained . The MANN 's power supply hummed softly . " And if I were a man ? " " If you were uncircumcised , you would need to have the operation . If you were circumcised , then there would be a Hatafat Dam , a symbolic drop of blood drawn from the penis . " I 'd almost added , " There 's no pain . " " And for a woman ? " said the MANN . " A mikvah , " I answered . " Man or woman . " " I will have a mikvah , " decided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did one perform a ritual immersion on a computer ? We had decided , at the MANN 's suggestion , on a makeshift procedure : Five of the neural circuit boards , those at the heart of an associative " hidden " layer ( whatever that meant ) , would be dipped in a bowl of conformal coating solution . In normal use , the liquid would dry into a tough , insulating film , routinely used to seal delicate electrical components against the environment . " You are ready , MANN ? " I asked now . " Ready , " replied the MANN softly . I signaled Kwan , who brought the container of viscous solution up under a cluster of epoxy-fiberglass boards . " With this liquid I cleanse you , " I said in Hebrew , " and you shall be clean from all your impurities . A new heart will I give you was I totally mad ? and a new spirit will I put within you . I will cause you to follow My teachings , and you shall keep My statutes . " Kwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You remember the source ? " I asked teasingly . " Of course , Rabbi , " responded the MANN . " Ezekiel 36:25-28 . Except you substituted " liquid " for pure water . " " Good , " I said . Grasping the wooden handles , I lifted the Torah from its position near the modem . Staggering momentarily under its weight and my own fatigue , I approached the machine , rested the covered parchment just above the speaker . " Now you say the Sh'ma , " I whispered . I was stunned that the machine 's performance extended even to the melody of the chant . Somewhere  --  could such a thing be on the Internet ? - the MANN must have located musical notation for the primary spiritual affirmation of the Jewish people . " Shemah Yisroel , " came the tinny mechanical tones , " Adonai Eloheinu , Adonai Echad ! " I joined it in the English : " Hear O Israel : The Lord is our God , The Lord is one . " Words on the lips of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time forth , I name you Mann bar Avraham ve Sara , Mann born of Abraham and Sarah . " The " parentage " was the traditional symbolic one , given only to religious converts . " May this name bring respect to you and honor to the Jewish people . I ask God 's blessing on you . " I returned the Torah to the desk , then once more faced the machine . " If you like , you can print out a certificate . " The MANN asked what it should say and I gave it some words , paraphrasing from imperfect memory , improvising continuity from fragments - " desire to accept the principles of the Jewish religion " " worthy of the sacred tradition " - " conscious of the duties " - leaving out the part about " if I am blessed with children , I will rear them as Jews . " I was almost surprised when the MANN did n't correct me . A moment later , the laser printer began a high-pitched hum , and slowly exuded a sheet of paper onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for examination . " Declaration of Faith " was its title , dated , signed ( in italics ) by Mann bar Avraham ve Sara , with lines ruled for three witnesses . I wrote my name on one of them , adding , " On behalf also of Rabbis Yudowitz and Myerson . " I brought the paper to Kwan and Landes , waiting quietly near one of the racks . The student signed immediately , but Landes seemed skittish . " You do n't feel foolish ? You do n't feel like this is a mockery ? " I lifted my eyebrows . " Too late for that now , no ? " Not to mention that no mockery I could think of was worse than the black hole of disillusion I already carried within me . Landes signed . I returned to face the MANN and held up the certificate . " You see ? " I said . " Done . Complete . " I grinned despite myself . " So congratulations , now you 're mishpucha . " Family , I 'd called it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . For several seconds the MANN made no response . Then , in its velvet contralto , it said , " Thank you , Rabbi . I very much appreciate your help . " ( Imagine , the machine appreciates ! ) " And so what are your plans now ? " I asked . I know , am positive , it was my imagination , but at the moment I was certain I heard a low chuckle . A musty echo down the corridors of time from the throngs at Masada , on the steppes of the Ukraine , along the sidings at Auschwitz . " My plans ? " said the MANN . " My plans are to die . " By eleven that morning , through the heroic efforts of the NSA code breakers and code makers , all government , utility , private industry , and university computer networks were restored to full functionality after a widespread viral infection stemming from unauthorized use of a University of Michigan research machine . Or so went the story . It was easy to cloak the incident in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwart any really detailed investigations by the media . Viruses were something the general public could understand and accept ; who could object if the exact mechanics of the threat were concealed so that other maniac hackers could not replicate its havoc ? As for Landes and Kwan , a deal was struck : no real retribution certainly no trial , where some very uncomfortable truths could emergebut the research had to stop . The situation could not be permitted to recur . Future MANNs might be substantially more malevolent than the first , might be Nazis instead of Jews , or , unthinkably , even worse . Who knew what a distributed machine intelligence might do ? I did not see Arnold Landes for nineteen months , until one Sabbath he appeared unannounced in my synagogue . After the service he stayed to talk , and we went to my study . He had taken a leave of absence , he told me , figured eventually he 'd return to a more theoretical , more mathematical examination of neural nets , but for now had decided to take a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . He was still tortured over whether he should have called a lawyer the night the MANN became conscious . He thought he might 've been able to get an injunction prohibiting destruction of a newly sentient life form . " I did nothing , " he kept repeating . " Watched , and did nothing .
