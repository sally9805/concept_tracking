<p> There actually was a time when people did n't trade cocktail party chatter on whether step exercise was better than jogging or how many stomach crunches would ensure a flat gut . They did n't compare fat percentages or cholesterol levels - if they even knew what cholesterol was - and the word " aerobics " was n't in the dictionary . <p> It was a time of innocence . And it was just 25 years ago . <p> " The thinking then was ' Take it easy . Do n't push yourself . ' If you were past 40 , you were told to ' act your age , " ' said Dr. Kenneth Cooper , founder of the Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas . <p> Cooper is the guy often credited with changing all that - he popularized the term " aerobics " to mean vigorous exercise - but early in his career , even he subscribed to the " take it easy " theory . <p> He 'd been a college track star but during medical school had let himself get out of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he no longer had stamina even for water skiing . <p> " I was struck by the realization that I had allowed my body to deteriorate to such an extent that I could n't engage in normal sports without endangering my life , " Cooper recalled . <p> So he got himself back in shape - and then prepared to try to do the same for the rest of the country from his position as director of the Air Force 's Aerospace Medical Laboratory . He worked on a doctorate in exercise physiology from Harvard School of Public Health , with an eye toward proving his theory that it is easier and more effective to maintain good health than to regain it once it 's lost . <p> In 1968 , Cooper published " Aerobics " ( now in paperback by Bantam ) , which suggested the minimum amount of exercise required each week to have an effect on health . Ironically , the title was n't his choice and he fought against it , because he thought it was too obscure . The publisher plucked the word from a chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise producing beneficial changes in the respiratory and circulatory systems . " It stuck , and eventually warranted an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary . <p> Cooper 's new ideas went only so far in the military , however . When he proposed a physical conditioning center at San Antonio 's Lackland Air Force Base , his report was returned with a derisive " Ha , ha " scribbled across it by a two-star general . <p> Cooper was crushed , but the negative reaction spurred him to leave the Air Force and in 1970 to open his own Cooper Clinic , with two rooms , two employees " and the first treadmill in Dallas . " <p> Colleagues skeptical <p> The public seemed willing to listen to his ideas , but colleagues were still skeptical . <p> Cooper remembers that some doctors considered him a " quack , " and headlines of the day predicted " the streets are going to be full of dead joggers as more Americans follow that crazy Cooper 's concepts and ideas . " <p> " I knew what I was doing was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started collecting data , " said Cooper in a recent phone interview . <p> Eventually , he did prove his theory ; research at his Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research showed , among other things , that if a person gets to the " top " level of fitness , it translates to a 65 percent reduction in deaths from heart attacks , strokes , diabetes and cancer and up to a three-year increase in longevity . <p> Today , virtually no one questions the idea that exercise is beneficial , and Americans ' presence in the gym - and on the jogging and walking tracks , on the bike trails , in swimming pools - is widespread . <p> Few things wrong <p> But Cooper himself has admitted to being wrong about some of his early ideas . <p> " Initially , I said that exercise overcomes all , bad diets and bad habits and all that . Now I know it does n't . <p> " And I once said , ' You ca n't run too much . ' I used to think , the more the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 miles a week are running for something other than cardiovascular fitness , " said Cooper . <p> In Cooper 's first book , there were five activities listed for aerobic exercise ; by 1982 , the list had expanded to 31 . By then , research also had proved that not as much exercise as he had previously recommended was necessary to achieve health benefits . <p> Open access <p> Both of those developments made the idea of fitness more accessible to and more attainable by the masses , which helped to push the number of Americans who regularly engage in some form of exercise to about 40 percent . <p> Research also has made it possible for people to know exactly how much exercise they need to achieve the fitness level they desire - what 's called an " exercise prescription . " <p> For example , Cooper recommends that people who want to achieve the health and longevity levels of fitness - that 's the level that will result in a 55 percent reduction in deaths from disease , he said - should reach their target heart rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes three times a week . <p> Move it on over <p> More simply , that translates to walking 2 miles in less than 30 minutes , three times a week . <p> Or , says Cooper , you could walk 2 miles in 35 minutes and do it four times a week , or walk 3 miles in 45 minutes and do it twice a week . Alternatively , take two 45-minute dance classes a week . <p> Even newer research has shown that the 30-minute recommendation does n't have to be done all at once ; that is , 30 minutes done cumulatively in the course of the day works as well . <p> So if you park five blocks from work and spend 10 minutes walking to the office , and combine it with another 10 minutes of walking at noon and 10 minutes in the evening , you 've gotten your dose for the day . <p> But if would-be exercisers are confused by talk of " prescriptions " and numbers , along with what seems like a barrage of ever-conflicting health advice , they 're missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people is , just get out and do something , " he said . <p> It 's a message that 's echoed by another big name in the fitness field , Dr. James Rippe , a cardiologist and director of the Exercise Physiology and Nutrition Center in Shrewsbury , Mass . <p> Inactivity hazardous <p> " The whole idea in exercise today is to simplify it to this core message : We know that inactivity is hazardous to your health . We need to get every adult and child in this country moving , " said Rippe . <p> His other current interest is how to motivate people , and to that end he 's recommending heart monitors - worn not by recovering heart patients , but by healthy , everyday exercisers who want to know what effect exercise is having on their bodies . <p> Absolutely essential <p> " Knowing your exact heart rate and having a clear idea of your goals is absolutely essential for success , " said Rippe . And contrary to what many exercise teachers promote , a manual pulse reading can be off by as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a rough gauge , you can predict your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age in years from 220 beats per minute . Then , said Rippe , determine your goal : If you want improved physical fitness , exercise at least three times a week for 20-30 minutes with a target zone of 65 percent to 85 percent of that maximum rate . <p> For weight loss , aim for five or six times a week at 60 percent to 70 percent of the maximum . <p> To reduce the risk of chronic disease , 50 percent to 60 percent a few times a week is adequate - and " that 's very comfortable for most people , " said Rippe . <p> Heart monitors cost from $ 60 to $ 250 , but Rippe does n't think that 's out of the range of many people who are serious about their fitness goals . <p> " People will buy a $ 200 pair of sneakers and think nothing of it . ... this is a way to get motivated , " he said . <p> Both Rippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be how to better motivate people . <p> Even though the fitness movement has changed American lifestyles - spawning new ways of eating , dressing , and leisure-time activities - there still are 60 percent of us who remain sedentary . <p> Cooper sees exercise as a key player in the issue of health reform . <p> " You want to see a reduction in the cost of health care ? <p> " You want to see people living longer , healthier , fuller lives ? It can happen in this country , " said Cooper - who , at age 62 , still runs marathons and has n't lost any of the enthusiasm he had a quarter-century ago when he started the aerobics movement . <p> " It 's my utmost goal to see a fitter America in my lifetime , " he said . <p> " And I 'll expend my last healthy breath trying to accomplish just that .
