Summary <p> Background Inclusion of new vaccines in vaccination programmes for children would be easier if they could be combined with existing vaccines . Vaccines containing acellular pertussis in the **35;2754;TOOLONG combination are expected to replace the conventional whole-cell vaccines ( DTP-w ) . We tested the immunogenicity and safety of a combination of DTP-a with the Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate of Hib capsular polysaccharide and tetanus toxid ( PRP-T ) , and inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) . <p> Methods 120 infants were enrolled and randomised to four groups to receive DTP-a at ages 2 , 4 , and 6 months . At 4 and 6 months they also received Hib conjugate and IPV , either as separate injections or mixed with DTP-a . All injections were given intramuscularly in the anterolateral area of the thigh . Any reactions after each vaccination were noted by the parents . EIA was used to measure titres of diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis antibodies , RIA for Hib anticapsular antibodies , and microneutralisation assay for poliovirus antibodies from serum samples collected at the ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Findings There were 30 infants in each group . Only mild adverse events were reported . There was a tendency towards slightly lower concentrations of filamentous haemagglutinin , tetanus , and poliovirus 1 antibodies when the vaccines were mixed . However , there was a more pronounced difference ( p=4x10 -8 ) in Hib antibodies between groups receiving Hib capsular polysaccharide mixed with DTP-a ( geometric mean concentrations 0.37 MUg/mL and 0.56 MUg/mL ) compared with groups receiving the vaccines separately ( 3.10 MUg/mL and 3.94 MUg/mL ) . <p> Interpretation Administration of premixed DTP-a , Hib conjugate , and IPV affect the immune response significantly . The mechanism of this interference is not clear . The immunogenicity of all antigens must be tested before new combinations can be accepted for vaccination programmes for infants . <p> Lancet 1996 ; 348 : 1688-92 Introduction <p> Effective immunisation of children against multiple diseases , is best tackled by giving several antigens in one injection . Preparation of the single vaccine could be done either during manufacture of vaccines or immediately before administration . Safe and effective combined vaccines already exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) vaccine consists of a combination of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and killed pertussis cells , the inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) of three types of polioviruses , and the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine of the three live viruses mixed in the same vaccine dose . <p> Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) vaccines consisting of capsular polysaccharide protein conjugates have been introduced into routine vaccination programmes in several countries . Since authorities recommended that the first doses of both Hib conjugate and DTP-w vaccines are given at the same time ( between ages 2 and 6 months ) their suitability to be administered in combination has been tested. 1-11 The antibody concentrations after the primary series have in general been satisfactory , and the slightly lower concentrations of Hib or pertussis antibodies after mixing observed in some studies have been deemed clinically unimportant . Combinations of DTP-w with Hib , with or without IPV , have been licensed for general use in some European countries , the USA , and Canada . <p> New acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed to avoid the adverse events attributed to conventional whole-cell pertussis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published , 12-15 and some of the new candidate vaccines have been licensed . DTP-w vaccine is likely to be replaced in general vaccination programmes by DTP containing acellular pertussis vaccine ( DTP-a ) . <p> Postimmunisation antibody concentrations to diphtheria and tetanus toxoid , Hib capsular polysaccharide , and polioviruses correlate with clinical efficacy ; we therefore analysed immunological responses to combinations of DTP-a , Hib conjugate , and IPV to test whether the immunogenicity of these vaccines given in the same syringe is equivalent to that of the vaccines given in separate syringes but at the same time . Methods <p> After receiving written consent from parents , we enrolled 120 infants at the age of 2 months from Salo Health Centre , Finland , and randomised them to four groups according to child health centre . The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Public Health Institute , Helsinki , Finland , and the local health board of Salo . <p> All the study vaccines were manufactured by SmithKline Beecham Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium . The DTP-a vaccine was a mixture of separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filamentous haemagglutinin , 8 MUg pertactin , and 25 Lf ( &gt;/=30 IU ) diphtheria toxoid , and 10 Lf ( &gt;/=40 IU ) tetanus toxoid . The 0.5 mL final vaccine dose also contained 0.5 mg aluminium hydroxide , 4.5 mg sodium chloride and 2.5 mg phenoxyethanol . The lyophilised Hib conjugate vaccine PRP-T was a conjugate of 10 MUg Hib capsular polysaccharide and 30 MUg tetanus toxoid . It was diluted either with its own diluent ( saline ) when administered separately or with DTP-a when administered combined . The IPV vaccine consisted of inactivated polioviruses : type 1 ( Mahoney ; 40 D-antigen units ) , type 2 ( MEF-1 ; 8 D-antigen units ) , and type 3 ( Saukett ; 32 D-antigen units ) . The Hib and IPV vaccines were each given as 0.5 mL doses . <p> Children received either three separate 0.5 mL injections ( group A ; all vaccines given separately ) ; one 1.0 mL injection , and one0.5 mL injection ( group B ; DTP-a and IPV mixed , Hib separately ) ; two separate 0.5 mL injections ( group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or one 1.0 mL injection ( group D ; all vaccines mixed ) . All injections were given intramuscularly in the anterolateral area of the thigh . <p> Parents were asked to record , on a structured form , the child 's general health and behaviour ( fever , irritability , unusual sleepiness , local reactions ) at 6 h , 24 h , 48 h , and 72 h after vaccination . In addition , the study nurse contacted the parents by telephone on day 4 and asked whether the child had experienced any further adverse events . <p> Serum samples ( 3-5mL venous blood ) were obtained before each vaccination , and 1 month after the third vaccination ( ie , age of 7 months ) . Serum samples were stored at - 20 degrees C until assayed . All laboratory assays were done at the National Public Health Institute , Helsinki , Finland . <p> Antibodies to Hib were measured by RIA 16 with a reference serum ( lot 1983 ) from Cark Frasch ( Food and Drug Administration , MD , USA ) , containing 70 MUg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified version of the **33;2821;TOOLONG was used to assay the concentrations of tetanus and diphtheriaIgG antitoxins. 17 The antitoxin contents of the reference serawere as established by WHO international standards for tetanus and diphtheria antitoxins . The detection concentration was 0.03 IU/mL for both antibodies . IgG antibodies to pertussis toxoid , filamentous haemagglutinin , and pertactin were measured by EIA. 18 Units were calculated by the parallel-line bioassay method and expressed as EU/mL . The lower limit of detection was 4 EU/mL . <p> Microneutralisation assay for poliovirus antibodies was done by a standard procedure : 19 duplicate two-fold dilutions of sera 100 CCID 50 each of the type 1 , type 2 , and type 3 poliovirus strains and overnight neutralisation at 36 degrees C with 30000 Vero cells per well . The titre was scored according to the reciprocal of last serum dilution with 50% inhibition of viral cytopathic effect at day 6 . <p> Immunogenicity of the vaccines was analysed by geometric means , with non-detectable values being assigned as the detection limit ( Hib capsular polysaccharide ) or as half of the lower detection limit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportions exceeding predetermined threshold values for antibody concentrations . ANOVA of each four-group comparison was used to identify intergroup differences . If significant variation in ANOVA was revealed , means in the study groups were compared by two-way Student 's t test . Kruskall-Wallis H test was used for poliovirus antibody titres . ANOVA and t test were done on the logarithms of the observations . chi 2 was used to analyse differences in proportions . Results <p> 120 infants were enrolled in the study , 30 randomised to each of four treatment groups , vaccinated , and followed for adverse events ( figure ) . None of the infants were removed from the study . A total of 471 serum samples were obtained for analysis . <p> There were no serious adverse events thought to be related to the study vaccines : 13 children were admitted to hospital during the study period , but for reasons not related to the vaccinations . The adverse events reported by the parents were mild and resolved spontaneously . The follow-up data ( table 1 ) showed no clinically significant differences between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine few children had antibodies to Hib capsular polysaccharide and the geometric mean concentration was low ( table 2 ) . After the first dose of Hib conjugate a serum antibody response was seen in all groups , but the geometric mean concentrations in groups A and B ( DTP-a and Hib conjugate given separately ) were significantly higher than in groups C and D ( Hib conjugate mixed with DTP-a ; p&lt;0.05 in all comparisons ) . There were also differences between the study groups in the percentages of children with a Hib capsular polysaccharide antibody concentration above 0.15 MUg/mL or above 1.0 MUg/mL . <p> After the second dose of Hib vaccine the geometric mean concentrations of Hib capsular polysaccharide antibodies were much higher in groups A and B ( differences between A and B not significant ) than in groups C and D ( differences not significant ) . The difference between groups A and B ( received DTP-a and Hib vaccines separately ) and C and D ( received mixed vaccines ) was highly significant , p&lt;0.001 , for all comparisons . Furthermore , all children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 7 months , whilst there were three infants in group C and two in group D whose Hib capsular polysaccharide antibody concentrations were still below the detection limit of 0.06 MUg/mL . <p> We found no differences between the groups in antibody responses to the other vaccine antigens . At age 7 months , 1 month after the first series of vaccinations , all children had good responses to the three pertussis components . Before vaccination the geometric mean concentrations of antibodies to pertussis toxoid ranged from 2.3 to3.5 EU/mL among the four groups ; the ranges for filamentous haemagglutinin and pertactin were 3.2-4.8 EU/mL and 2.1-3.1 EU/mL , respectively . The geometric mean concentrations at 7 months are given in table 3 . <p> Diphtheria antibody concentrations increased from the preimmunisation concentrations of 0.02-0.03 IU/mL after the first dose of DTP-a , continued to increase after the second dose , and reached final geometric mean concentrations of 0.33-0.41 IU/mL after the third dose ( table 3 ) . There were no significant differences between groups . Tetanus antibody concentrations in groups A to D , respectively , were 0.53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 months and 1.20 , 1.27 , 0.75 , and 1.08 IU/mL after three doses . The geometric mean concentration of tetanus antibodies was significantly higher in groups A and B than in groups C and D ( 1.23 vs 0.90 IU/mL ; p&lt;0.05 ) . <p> All children were seropositive for the three serotypes of poliovirus after two doses of IPV at 4 and 6 months . The geometric mean titres of antibodies to all three polioviruses were slightly but not significantly higher in groups A and C ( received IPV and DPT-a separately ) than in groups B and D ( received these vaccines mixed ; table 3 ) . However , in group D ( all three vaccines mixed in the same syringe ) , neutralising antibodies to type 1 poliovirus ( geometric mean 3724 ) were significantly lower ( p&lt;0.05 , Kruskall-Wallis test ) than those in groups A and C ( geometric means 14859 and 10914 , respectively ) . Moreover , after the first dose of IPV groups A and C had higher titres than group D ( data not shown ) . These higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interferes with the primary antibody response to poliovirus antigens , but the clinical effect is less after a complete course of IPV immunisation . Discussion <p> Because new DTP-a vaccines containing acellular pertussis components are likely to be given simultaneously with Hib conjugates and inactivated polio vaccines , we decided to study the various combinations of these three vaccines . Although all combinations proved safe , the poor immunogenicity of the Hib component when it was mixed with DTP-a in the two dose schedules studied here raises important questions about the immunological mechanism of the interference seen and about its clinical relevance . <p> According to parents ' reports , made by the second evening after vaccination ( table 1 ) , the adverse event rates were low . Usually reactions to vaccines are based on four time periods during 3 days , however , table 2 gives cumulative data for 2 days , as recommended by Pichichero et al. 20 Additional information collected did not alter the low rate of adverse events found . <p> Although most antibody concentrations at age 7 months , 1 month after the primary series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type 1 and especially to Hib capsular polysaccharide were reduced by the mixing of Hib or IPV , or both , with DTP-a . <p> Some interference between DTP and the conjugate of Hib capsular polysaccharide and tetanus toxoid ( PRP-T ) has been suggested in studies with DTP-w vaccine. 1 , 4 , 7-11 Small numbers of children participated in those studies , and few of the differences between children receivingPRP-T and DTP-w either combined or separately were significant . <p> In three studies 21-23 in which children received three doses of the same DTP-a and Hib conjugate vaccines as in our study , the geometric mean concentrations of antibodies to Hib were significantly smaller in the groups receiving these vaccines mixed , in contrast to separate administration . This phenomenon has also been observed with another DTP-a and Hib oligosaccharide CRM197 protein conjugate. 24 A tendency towards lower concentrations of antibodies to the carrier protein ( tetanus toxoid 21 , 23 or diphtheria toxin variants 24 ) was also seen in all of these studies . <p> The mechanism by which mixing of the vaccines reduced the antibody response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hib conjugates could be incompatible with the aluminium hydroxide adjuvant in the DTP-a vaccine . Theoretically a non-adsorbed component ( Hib conjugate ) might become adsorbed , or an adsorbed component ( diphtheria or tetanus toxoid ) become deadsorbed after mixing , and this change in presentation might offer their immunogenicity . The reports on mixtures of DTP-w and Hib conjugates did not , however , show any clear correlation between the type or amount of aluminum salts and impairment of Hib antibody responses . <p> The amount of specific Bordetella pertussis antigens is higher in the acellular than in whole-cell vaccines. 25 Components , such as filamentous haemagglutinin , might impair the immunogenicity of the Hib capsular polysaccharide vaccine . Why this impairment would occur only when the components are mixed is not clear . <p> Local antigenic competition or carrier-induced epitopic suppression are also possible mechanisms of interference between DTP-a ( containing tetanus toxoid ) and the Hib conjugate , in which the carrier protein is tetanus toxoid . However , this hypothesis should also be applicable to DTP-w mixed with Hib conjugates . <p> The clinical significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration of Hib antibodies in Finnish studies after a similar primary immunisation series with commercially available PRP-T vaccine , given simultaneously with DTP-w but at a separate site , was 4-6 MUg/mL. 26 , 27 This concentration is almost the same as that found in our study in the groups receiving the Hib and DTP-a vaccines separately , which supports the finding that interference only occurs when the vaccines are mixed . On the other hand , the much lower Hib capsular polysaccharide antibody concentrations in our DTP-a plus Hib combination groups ( C and D ) were similar to the Finnish efficacy trial with the first Hib conjugate ( PRP conjugated to diphtheria toxoid ) . 28 That study showed 90% protective efficacy of the vaccine , which suggested that these antibody concentrations were sufficient for protection . However , no protection could be shown with the same PRP-D vaccine in a study in Alaska , where the possibility of Hib infection is higher. 29 Strong arguments have been presented for booster vaccination because of the importance of induction of immunological memory. 30 We intend to collect data on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 months . Before clear evidence for induction of immunologic memory is available , we can not recommend widespread use of the DTP-a plus Hib combination with the two-dose schedule for infants used in this study . <p> <p> We thank Leena Saarinen and Mirja Stenvik , for their valuable work in carrying out the antibody assays ; Mervi Eerola for advice in statistical analyses ; and Pirjo Helena Makela , Hugues Bogaerts , and Ralf Clemens , for critical reading of the manuscript .
