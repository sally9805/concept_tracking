<p> AS he recuperated from kidney surgery last March , Richard A. Lundwall stared at the walls of his hospital room and stewed about how he was being treated by his longtime employer , Texaco Inc . <p> Weeks before , Mr. Lundwall had been unceremoniously forced out of his job in Texaco 's finance department . Most colleagues ignored him ; no one offered an official farewell on his last day . Mr. Lundwall even felt slighted by the company 's failure to send a personal note during his stay at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut . <p> The events played through his mind again and again . As a former marine , Mr. Lundwall prided himself on his ability to confront adversity . But now , as his long career seemed to be dwindling to a depressing end at age 55 , the bedridden executive felt powerless for the first time in his life . <p> And then it hit him : The tapes . <p> He called his wife , Petria , at home and asked her to bring his tape recorder and the mini-cassettes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was excitedly sitting in bed , listening by earphone to the meetings he had secretly recorded years earlier when Texaco executives belittled minorities and plotted the destruction of documents demanded in a discrimination suit . <p> " I knew right then that if they ever were to make the light of day , those tapes would be very embarrassing , to say the least , for Texaco , " Mr. Lundwall said in a recent interview . <p> With that , Mr. Lundwall set the stage for a highly publicized scandal at Texaco , the international oil giant based in White Plains . Months later , he turned the recordings over to the plaintiffs ' lawyers in the discrimination suit brought on behalf of the company 's minority employees . The cassettes quickly touched off a debate over the progress of minorities in corporate America , pushed Texaco into a record $140 million settlement of the discrimination suit and led prosecutors to investigate the document destruction as a possible criminal act . <p> Lost amid the tumult that followed the disclosure of the tapes last November was the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has remained silent , unwilling to explain why a former Texaco loyalist set off a scandal that stunned the company and turned the executives implicated in the document destruction  --  including Mr. Lundwall himself  --  into targets of criminal investigators . <p> Now , even as the case against Mr. Lundwall moved forward with his indictment on Thursday on a charge of obstructing justice , he is telling his story . In a wide-ranging series of interviews , he described how the life he built after a childhood of poverty had drastically changed for the worse . And he spoke of his motivation for recording , keeping and , finally , disclosing the now-infamous tapes . <p> Mr. Lundwall 's unusual story was also pieced together through court and corporate records , as well as with interviews of family members , business associates and other participants in the continuing scandal . <p> What emerges is a portrait of a man of contradictions , at one moment an eager participant in apparent wrongdoing , at another the whistle-blower exposing those same activities . But he also comes through as a strikingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unleashing . <p> The events surrounding Mr. Lundwall also raise difficult questions about how companies should handle executives when they expose potential wrongdoing in which they willingly took part . <p> Indeed , Mr. Lundwall 's fate has provoked heated debate among some in the legal and civil rights communities . <p> " To indict Mr. Lundwall is to put a chilling effect on the initiative of Richard Lundwalls at other companies , " said Roy Innis , the national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality . " We should respect the sacrifice he made in coming forward , so that other Richard Lundwalls might do the same . " <p> Indeed , Mr. Lundwall 's future looks gloomy . Unable to find work , he spends his time at home in Danbury and volunteering in a homeless shelter . Many of the health and retirement benefits from Texaco are gone , cut off by the company . His wife , who had hoped to retire soon , must continue her job at a retailer to keep health insurance and hold up their sagging finances . Even the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail-thin man , having lost 20 pounds since the saga began . As he examines the wreckage , his regrets mount . <p> " Was it the right thing to do ? " Mr. Lundwall asked . " Sure . Would I do it again , if I knew what was going to occur ? Chances are , no . In the real world , you do n't want to put your head in that guillotine . I do n't know a sane man who would . And I 'm certainly sane . " <p> The Second Family After Drifting , Job Is an Anchor <p> The Chevrolet sat motionless on the exit ramp off the Southern State Parkway . The car had blown a tire , but the driver had no idea how to change it . She did n't even own a jack . <p> A green Mercury Comet pulled up behind and stopped . It must have been a welcome sight . Driving the Comet was a man who wore the Star : a Texaco service station attendant . The young man , wearing the company uniform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , walked toward the Chevy . In a flash , the flat was changed . <p> The driver asked what she owed . Richard Lundwall smiled . Nothing , he replied . The next time she filled up , he told her , just think Texaco . <p> The year was 1965 , and Mr. Lundwall was one of the latest , and proudest , employees at Texaco 's gas stations . After years of professional drifting  --  from insurance investigator to postal clerk to back-office worker on Wall Street  --  Mr. Lundwall had found his calling . <p> " I would have gone to any lengths for the company , " he said recently . " I wanted to present their best side . To me back then , Texaco was the best thing since sliced bread . " <p> Texaco also offered security to a man who had not experienced much of it before . Raised in the South Bronx , Mr. Lundwall was the third of seven children in an impoverished , poorly educated and troubled family . <p> " Growing up was rough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our father was there only on and off . And most of the time , we were on welfare . " <p> Mr. Lundwall attended school sporadically , at best , and after turning 15 he dropped out to find work . Lying about his age , he joined the National Guard , but was discharged when his deception was discovered . <p> But the military bug had bitten . As soon as he could , he joined the Marines and learned a sense of discipline that he had sorely lacked . <p> By October 1965 , Mr. Lundwall was settling down . He had left the military , married , and after some job-hopping , had joined Texaco . <p> Mr. Lundwall loved the job , pumping gas at a station in New Jersey , and he was soon entrusted with keeping its books . <p> Soon , Mr. Lundwall had a young son and an up-and-down job history within Texaco . But in 1969 , a call from Texaco headquarters set him on a new career path : A position had opened in employee relations . Mr. Lundwall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lundwall worked among executives , handling personnel and clerical duties . He got a taste of the pay and benefits that went along with grabbing a lower rung on the corporate ladder . <p> His pride in Texaco swelled to unwavering loyalty . He made numerous sacrifices , often working weekends , nights and vacations . To help his career , he attended night school , and in 1977 earned a bachelor 's degree . <p> The hard work was worth it . In the early 1980 's , he was promoted to the human resources unit of Texaco 's finance department . With the raise he received , Mr. Lundwall could stop working extra jobs . <p> Mr. Lundwall finally seemed to have secured his future . <p> The Red Flags Hiring Policies And Contradictions <p> Richard Lundwall handed the paperwork for a new hire to a senior company executive for approval . While reviewing the documents , Mr. Lundwall said , the senior executive zeroed in on the name of the prospective worker , who was Jewish . <p> " He looked at it and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them ? ' " Mr. Lundwall recalled . <p> With that experience in the early 1980 's , Mr. Lundwall began to wonder for the first time if Texaco had problems dealing with diversity . <p> As his duties grew to include recruiting , other incidents would raise more questions . Despite Texaco 's professed interest in hiring and promoting minorities , he said he came to believe that the company 's policies seemed designed to fail . <p> A trip to a convention sponsored by a national association of black M.B.A . ' s held promise , but nothing came of it . " We came back with a stack of resumes that would knock your socks off , " Mr. Lundwall said . " But then the hiring result was zero . So you start thinking , ' What are we doing here ? ' " <p> In particular , Mr. Lundwall said , he was frustrated by Texaco 's refusal to expand its search for college graduates outside of a few top schools . His suggestions that Texaco look elsewhere for qualified minority candidates , particularly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures struck Mr. Lundwall as disingenuous . Texaco required that all job openings be posted , supposedly to insure that all candidates would be considered . But repeatedly , Mr. Lundwall found , the hiring decisions had already been made . <p> Texaco 's failure to recruit and promote minority candidates was documented in its own employment numbers . According to court records , in 1991 , of the 1,887 employees in the top pay grades at Texaco , only 19 were black . By 1994 , little had changed : The total number of employees in those levels had grown to 2,029 , but only 22 were black . <p> In 1994 , some minority executives decided to fight . That year , Bari-Ellen Roberts and Sil Chambers , who had both been recruited for the finance department years earlier , became lead plaintiffs in the discrimination suit against Texaco . The suit contended that the company 's promotion system , including its job posting program , was largely a sham . Instead , the suit said , the company thrived on a " good old boy " system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said its employment practices did not discriminate against minorities , and defended its program  --  including the posting of all jobs  --  as fair , racially neutral policies . <p> The reaction in the finance department , Mr. Lundwall said , was one of silence . But soon , Mr. Lundwall could not ignore the suit ; the plaintiffs demanded that he testify and tell them about documents involving the company 's employment practices . <p> On Aug. 5 , 1994 , Mr. Lundwall sat for his deposition . For several hours , Mr. Lundwall openly described company records that the plaintiffs had known nothing about but that could prove crucial to their case . <p> " Lundwall was very forthcoming , " said Cyrus Mehri , the plaintiff 's lawyer who took his deposition . " He was straight about every document he knew about . And those documents would be the very ones that they held back . " The Tape Recorder Acting on an Urge For Self-Protection <p> A few weeks later , Texaco received a discovery request demanding documents that Mr. Lundwall had identified . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records before the company lawyers saw them . <p> As he walked toward the meeting , Mr. Lundwall slipped his hand into his pocket and pressed the record button of a tiny microcassette recorder . He had purchased the recorder earlier , largely to retain conversations with an employee who repeatedly denied being told of assignments . <p> Over time , Mr. Lundwall had begun using the voice-activated recorder to protect himself . Texaco 's culture was changing , he said , and it seemed that it reacted to trouble by finding an employee to blame . <p> Sometimes he used the recorder to help him keep minutes of meetings . Other times , he secretly taped conversations that made him uneasy  --  a legal act in New York State . He first taped meetings about downsizing , nervous that too many executives selected to lose their jobs were over 55 . In the event of an age-discrimination lawsuit , he thought , the tapes would prove that he was following instructions . <p> The meeting about documents in the discrimination suit made him equally uncomfortable . If everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't the lawyers going to be there ? <p> Whatever his concerns , Mr. Lundwall showed few qualms during the meeting , according to the tapes and a transcript of them prepared by an independent investigator working for Texaco . <p> Mr. Lundwall and David Keough , a senior executive in the finance department , quickly found records that could prove troublesome and removed them from the pile . At one point , Robert Ulrich , then the company 's treasurer , asked who else might have copies of certain documents . <p> " I do n't want to be caught up in a cover-up , " Mr. Ulrich said , according to the transcript . " I do n't want to be my own Watergate . " <p> Later , the men discussed how the documents might help the plaintiffs ' lawyers . " We 're going to purge " the books , Mr. Ulrich said , according to the transcript . <p> As the men examined a restricted document , Mr. Lundwall suggested getting rid of it . " Let me shred this thing , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on his role in the discussions on document destruction . Jonathan Rosner , a lawyer for Mr. Ulrich , said his client had not destroyed documents that he knew had been requested in the case . Stephen E. Kaufman , a lawyer for Mr. Keough , said his client had not knowingly failed to comply with the instructions he received on the discovery requests . <p> Later , according to the investigators ' transcript , Mr. Lundwall recorded another conversation he had with Mr. Ulrich as well as with Peter Meade , a Texaco marketing manager . <p> Mr. Meade commented that he had been host for a New Year 's Eve party , and made it into a party celebrating Kwanzaa , a traditional African celebration . <p> " How nice , " Mr. Ulrich is quoted as saying . " These your integrated friends ? " The executive replied no , that he was just kidding his friends . <p> At one point , Mr. Ulrich expressed discomfort about Kwanzaa , an African harvest festival . " I 'm still struggling with Hanukkah , and now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as saying . " I mean , I lost Christmas . Poor St. Nicholas , they ( expletive ) all over his beard . " <p> Mr. Lundwall 's tape stopped recording minutes later . That day , he took the cassette , threw it into his desk drawer , and forgot about it . <p> The Parting A Final Year Of Unhappy Service <p> Mr. Lundwall eagerly awaited Christmas in 1995 . After years of skipping vacations for work , the holiday season become his family 's time to relax at home . <p> A week before his vacation was scheduled to begin , however , Mr. Lundwall was called into the office of James Link , who had replaced Mr. Ulrich when he retired . Mr. Link told Mr. Lundwall that he had some bad news : His job would be gone after June 1996 . <p> The news stunned and angered Mr. Lundwall . <p> " You 're talking about something that 's going to happen six months down the road , " Mr. Lundwall said . " It 's bad enough telling a person they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it when they 're going on vacation ? Could n't they have waited until I got back ? " <p> At home , his wife , Petria , could see his pain . <p> " This is a man who worked for them for 30 years , " Mrs. Lundwall said . " He gave up car pools so he could be there late ; he had all those years where he did n't take vacation . He gave and gave , and then they just cut him off . " <p> The timing could not have been worse . Thinking their finances secure , the Lundwalls had just built an addition to their house , paying almost $50,000 . Now they would have to pay off that debt without much income . <p> Mr. Lundwall figured that another year on the job would significantly lessen the financial blow . So in January , he applied unsuccessfully for two posted job opportunities at Texaco , interviewing with people who had known him for years . That month , he had his last day in the finance department . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tossed the microcassettes into a box and headed home . <p> Technically still employed by Texaco , he was given a desk but little to do in its human resources division . Things seem to have struck bottom . <p> Then in February 1996 , Mr. Lundwall had kidney failure . He was rushed to Danbury Hospital for surgery . And it was there , as he was recuperating , that an angry Mr. Lundwall finally remembered his tapes and listened to them . <p> For weeks , Mr. Lundwall said , he thought about what to do with the tapes . Besides his desire for revenge , he said he felt it was proper to disclose what happened in those meetings . He reflected on his own niece , who had married a black man and whose life is affected by racial attitudes . But still he was fearful that his slim chances for new work at Texaco might be destroyed . <p> " The right thing to do was come forward , " he said . " But I needed to work . " <p> On his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of Bari-Ellen Roberts , the black executive who was one of plaintiffs in the discrimination lawsuit against Texaco . He walked in and closed the door . <p> Casually , Mr. Lundwall asked Ms. Roberts if the case was continuing . " She said , ' Why do you ask ? ' " Mr. Lundwall recalled . " And I told her she might end up having another ally . " <p> The Lawyers A Bargaining Chip Begins to Backfire <p> Cyrus Mehri grabbed his ringing office phone on Aug. 1 , 1996 . The caller identified himself as Richard Lundwall , and offered information that would be of help in the discrimination lawsuit against Texaco . He also wanted to talk to Mr. Mehri about suing Texaco himself . <p> " As he was talking , I thought , ' Richard Lundwall , who is Richard Lundwall ? ' " Mr. Mehri said . " Then it clicked , and I said , ' Did n't I take your deposition ? ' " <p> Mr. Lundwall had called Mr. Mehri out of desperation . In July , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both told him that to bring an individual case against a giant like Texaco would be long , expensive and probably fruitless . <p> But Mr. Lundwall thought a lawyer might be interested if the price was right . So he decided to use tapes as leverage . <p> " I thought I could get a quid pro quo , " Mr. Lundwall said . " You know , ' Hey , if you represent me , I have information you might find useful . ' " <p> Mr. Mehri demurred , saying his work on the discrimination suit conflicted him out of representing Mr. Lundwall . But he offered to refer him elsewhere . <p> Days later , they spoke again . Mr. Lundwall made clear that he had tapes . They met on Aug. 12 in Danbury , at Marcus Dairy Restaurant . Mr. Lundwall , arrived wearing a baseball cap , but without the tapes . But he did describe them . <p> " He said the tapes contained discussions of tampering with evidence that was at the crux of the case , " Mr. Mehri said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texaco and turn over the tapes . <p> " Talk about mixed emotions , " he said . " It was grueling . I do n't know , 31 years of your life , you do n't just walk away from that . It takes a long time to sink in that , hey , she does n't love me any more . " <p> Seeking a lawyer , he telephoned Peter Gass , whom he had consulted earlier about suing Texaco . Mr. Gass told him his options were limited : He could either turn over the tapes or wait for them to be demanded in discovery . <p> Finally , Mr. Lundwall consented to send copies of the tapes to Mr. Mehri . <p> On Oct. 25 , Mr. Lundwall met at the Danbury Hilton with three of the plaintiffs ' lawyers in the discrimination suit , including Mr. Mehri . After all his anger , Mr. Lundwall said he felt mostly sadness as they reviewed the tapes . <p> " There 's no pleasure in hurting people , " he said . <p> Never did Mr. Lundwall think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of breaking company rules by destroying documents , and cut his benefits , that prosecutors would investigate , or even that the American public would ever hear the tapes . <p> " I just never really thought about it , " he said . " Amazing , is n't it ? A reasonably sophisticated guy , and I look at this whole thing like I 'm fresh off the farm . " <p> The Fallout High-Profile Player In Game of Hardball <p> " Allegations of racism at one of America 's largest corporations , " intoned Ted Koppel on " Nightline " in November 1996 . " Tonight , an unvarnished look into one company 's executive offices : the Texaco tapes . " <p> Mr. Lundwall sat in front of his television , staring in amazement . His face appeared on the screen , and his voice could be heard discussing the shredding of documents . <p> " It was sort of like watching your own funeral , " Mr. Lundwall said recently . <p> The tapes ' existence had been reported that week in The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and his wife stopped answering the telephone . <p> On the day of the " Nightline " broadcast , Texaco announced that Mr. Lundwall 's retirement benefits were being cut off , one of several steps taken against executives caught on the recording . Worse , he had been served with a subpoena from a Federal grand jury investigating the document destruction  --  a development that required him to hire a criminal lawyer , Christopher Riley . <p> " It was like somebody was playing a terrible joke , " he said . " In my wildest dreams , I never expected this to occur . And I had no idea where it was going . " <p> Because Mr. Lundwall had stepped forward and was the lowest-level Texaco executive who participated in the taped conversations , prosecutors tried to persuade him to cut a deal . <p> But they insisted that he plead guilty to a felony as part of any bargain , a requirement Mr. Lundwall could not accept . Having exposed what happened at Texaco , he thought , why should he be punished ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ever agree to a felony charge , " Mr. Lundwall said . " I told my lawyers , ' I will sell everything I have to go to trial if I have to , because this is just insanely unfair . ' " <p> Mr. Lundwall 's world had turned upside down . <p> A casual trip to the grocery store proved troublesome when he bumped into a Texaco employee . The encounter  --  with embellishments , Mr. Lundwall said  --  was reported back to Texaco 's investigator , who in turn called Mr. Lundwall 's lawyers to relay what he had heard . <p> The pain also came by mail . <p> One day , a card arrived for Mr. Lundwall showing two girls and a Christmas tree . An attached note from Peter Meade , who had been heard on tape , asked Mr. Lundwall to someday " tell me what I did to deserve what you did to my family . " <p> On Nov. 19 , Mr. Lundwall was scheduled to testify before the grand jury . He had already been advised to invoke the Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office that morning , he learned that the Government 's plans had changed . He was going to be arrested . Prosecutors were sending a message : If Mr. Lundwall was not willing to cooperate , they would play hardball . <p> At the courthouse , Mr. Lundwall was handcuffed , photographed and fingerprinted before being led into the courtroom . Dozens of reporters were waiting . <p> " I thought it was the Menendez trial or something , " he said . " I never imagined they were there for me . " <p> Released on bail , Mr. Lundwall hurried back to his lawyers ' office to telephone his wife before someone else told her what had happened . He was too late for his son Craig , who had already heard about his father 's arrest on the news . <p> In January of this year , prosecutors agreed to consider allowing him to plead to a misdemeanor , and Mr. Lundwall began cooperating . <p> But the prospect of pleading became too much when he applied for a new job . On the application , it asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard question . Once he pleaded guilty , Mr. Lundwall realized , he would forever have to answer that question with a yes . He decided to take his chance at trial . <p> " If I 'm going to be shot down from getting a job , " he said , then " let me at least fight for the right to get one . " <p> Mr. Lundwall broke off negotiations . Last Thursday , he was indicted on one count of obstruction of justice . If convicted , he faces 10 years in prison . <p> Chart : " Caught On Tape " Excerpts from a transcript compiled by a Texaco investigator of taped conversations between Richard A.
