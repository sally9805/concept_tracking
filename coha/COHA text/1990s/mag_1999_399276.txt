<p> Peaceful coexistence between human beings and machines requires clear communication . The best systems convey information so elegantly that we hardly think about the power they give us  --  boundaries dissolve and we become one with our technologies . The editors of TR picked 10 of the most ingenious and important . Loudspeaker <p> Early-twentieth-century poet G. K. Chesterton once said : " The moment in history when we had nothing important left to say was marked by the invention of the loudspeaker . " The device makes it possible to listen to a Wagner opera  --  or any other " unimportant " stuff while taking a bath , riding the subway or hiking in the forest . We can hear the electronically preserved voices of people long dead , as well as a universe of sounds unlike anything in nature . In a movie theater , loudspeakers surround us with sound and transport us into illusion . From Hitler to Hendrix , the century 's charismatic figures have reached the public through speakers . <p> Since the loudspeaker came on the scene around 1915 , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that audio recording and storage technologies are so good , loudspeakers are " easily the weakest link in the home audio system , " says William R. Short , Bose fellow at Bose Corp . in Framingham , Mass. , and co-inventor of Bose 's Acoustic Wave system . " No way am I going to sit in my living room and imagine that I 'm actually in Symphony Hall . It just does n't happen , and we really do n't know why yet . " <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain ! " Touch-Tone Telephone <p> AT &T; introduced " Touch-Tone " push-button phone dialing service in November 1963 . By all accounts , practically everyone who tried it liked it better than rotary dialing . Bell Labs researchers went to great lengths to make sure people would accept the new interface : They tested 16 different arrangements of buttons , including crosses and circular patterns . They also considered sizes , shapes and spacing of buttons , springiness when pushed , and even the contour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half is nice , but from the beginning the intention was to transform the telephone into a remote data entry device  --  a capability that expanded with the introduction of the " * " and " # " keys in 1968 . Though some of the services originally envisioned , such as using a telephone to turn on home appliances , have yet to materialize , the TouchTone phone has made possible phone trees , voice mail and a host of other services . Of course , sometimes the best way to get service is still to pretend you have a rotary phone and just stay on the line . <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Press 1 for ... " Steering Wheel <p> The first cars had tillers . Tillers worked , but they transmitted the vibration from primitive roads to the driver 's hand , making it hard to steer . When engines moved to the front of the car , the increased weight made tillers impractical . The steering wheel puts a gear system between you and the car 's wheels , offering a mechanical advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insulation , a good steering wheel manages to give the driver a feeling of intimate contact with the road . <p> One unforeseen problem with the wheel was that , as cars got speedier , people started getting impaled on steering columns in crashes . In the 1950s , concept cars were developed that did not have steering wheels but the public was n't interested . A car without a steering wheel just is n't a car . Contribution to the lexicon : " Take the wheel " Magnetic-Stripe Card <p> Machines let us through doors , dole out money , and extend credit . To do these jobs , they read an identity code embedded in a magnetic strip on a plastic card . Indeed , when you lose your wallet , the biggest concern is n't the cash  --  it 's the cards that might enable someone else to abuse your privileges . <p> Part of the reason we 're scared is that we 're so good at abusing our own privileges . In the early 1970s magnetic stripes on credit cards streamlined the authorization of credit card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with interest charges and new kinds of payment plans , the magnetic stripe helped the credit-card industry gorge America on credit . <p> Will new incarnations of plastic data in the form of " smart cards " go even further and make mag-stripe cards disappear ? Not so fast , says David Warwick , author of Ending Cash . " Chip cards are going to find niches in certain applications , " he says , " but I do n't see them replacing credit cards . No one wants to invest in new terminals . " <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Swipe your card . " Traffic Light <p> When African-American businessman Garrett Morgan patented the traffic light in 1923 , trains had been using automated lighted signals for some time . But trains run on set schedules , in single file , and it 's no small task to stop ; therefore , the default message from a train signal is " proceed . " Traffic lights for automobiles have a quite different task , and more often than we 'd like , it 's to tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Road-rage expert Leon James , professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii , says we link self-esteem to the gas and brake pedals . " If you see a light turning yellow , you have to accelerate . If you have to stop because the light turned red , you feel crestfallen . " James calls the intersection a " psychodynamic zone . " If so , it 's a zone increasingly under the dominion of the superego rather than the id . Some new traffic lights can take pictures of the license plates of cars that run red lights . The offender later receives a ticket in the mail  --  or a printed driving lesson . Others show drivers their current speed . At a traffic light , says James , " a lot can be done between the city transportation department and the driver . It 's a communication hotspot . " <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Give it the green light " Remote Control <p> The universal desire to avoid television commercials was the driving force behind the development of the remote control ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first remote , developed by Zenith in 1950 , ran a cable from the viewer to the set . The first wireless remote , introduced by Zenith in 1955 , used light sensors ; later models used ultrasonics . Infrared remotes , which came along in the early 1980s , were so cheap everyone could afford them . Today the remote is standard equipment ; 99 percent of television sets and 100 percent of VCRs come equipped for action at a distance . Especially for children who grew up with remote controls , surfing from channel to channel is part of the television viewing experience . Remote controls have been blamed for making us couch potatoes , but that 's an unfair rap ; it 's not as if people without remote controls used to get up and change the channel frequently . <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Channel surfing " Cathode-Ray Tube <p> The cathode-ray tube ( CRT ) made its debut in 1897 in an oscilloscope , developed by German physicist Kari Ferdinand Braun . The " killer app " for the CRT , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did n't enter most American homes until the 1950s . Now it 's everywhere . " TV is the main experience of waking life for most people in western industrial nations , ' claims Jerry Mander , author of Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television . That may be overstating the case , but not by much ; the average American watches several hours of television a day . <p> Put a computer interface on the screen , however , and we 're not quite so passive : We interact with it , turning the screen display into a means to an end rather than the end itself . But the emergence of terms like " Internet addiction " illustrates that often many of us would rather sit at a CRT than do anything else . <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " The tube " Liquid Crystal Display <p> Television and computer screens convey massive amounts of visual information . The downside ? They 're found in a big heavy box , because they generally require a cathode-ray tube . Liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ) make graphical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Austrian botanist Frederich Reinitzer , they were n't used for displays until 1971 , when Hoffmann-La Roche patented the " twisted nematic " LCD  --  the kind now found in calculators and watches . The active-matrix LCD , in which every pixel is controlled by a transistor , arrived in the 1980s , making possible laptop computers , miniature TVs and portable DVD players . <p> Although LCDs still have " issues of video speed and viewing-angle dependence " to be worked out , Webster E. Howard , vice president for technology at FED Corp . of Hopewell Junction , N.Y. , predicts that thin , flat , liquid crystal displays will replace the bulky CRT monitors on our desks within five years . If they come into widespread use , he says , LCDs will owe their success to laptop computers : " The need for the portable computer was what made possible the investment in this technology that ultimately led it to be economical and cheap . " <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Laptop " Mouse/Graphical User Interface <p> " When I started with the mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work online at a computer display , " says Douglas Engelbart , who invented the mouse and graphical user interface ( GUI ) in the 1960s . His mouse/GUI combination , further developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) in the 1970s and popularized by Apple in the 1980s , made a computer 's contents visible . Before that , to edit a computer file , you had to remember its name and location . The reduced demand on short-term memory , combined with a visual-spatial environment users enjoyed , converted the computer display into a workspace . In his book Interface Design , Steven Johnson says Engelbart 's invention " probably had more to do with popularizing the digital revolution than any other software advance " <p> Making everything visual rather than linguistic , however , means that semantically complex commands get left in the dust . With a command-line operating system ( remember DOS ? ) a task such as making a copy of every file ending in " . txt " took a few keystrokes . A GUI offers no shortcut . Engelbart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user 's hands and a special " chording " keyset in the other , thinks today 's GUI is awfully primitive : " Here 's the language they 're proposing : You point to something and grunt . " Our cave-dwelling ancestors would have understood . <p> Contribution to the lexicon : " Point-and-click " Barcode Scanner <p> In February 1992 , George Bush was given a demo of a supermarket barcode scanner made by NCR . His response ? " That 's amazing ! " Contrary to news accounts of the incident , however , he was n't wowed by the mere existence of scanner technology , which has been around since 1974 . He was marveling at a new , improved version that was able to read a barcode torn into seven pieces . <p> Scanners have come a long way since the first 10-pack of Juicy Fruit gum was scanned at Marsh Supermarket in Troy , Ohio . The initial draw for companies was accuracy of data entry : Barcode readers made a lot fewer errors than cashiers . But lurking in the laser 's capability was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are selling , and when , and in what combinations . Says Craig Maddox , product line director for barcode scanners at NCR , " it was a good 15 years before the grocery industry started to use the data . " Nowadays , retailers compile terabyte-sized databanks of every transaction in their stores and sell it back to vendors ; barcodes have also speeded communication across the whole supply chain so much , remarks Maddox , that " some stores ... do n't pay for the product until it 's already sold .
