As this issue goes to print , Nina Kiriki Hoffman 's popular story from our January 1995 issue , " Home for Christmas , " sits atop the preliminary Nebula ballot . She has had a good year . Her novel . The Silent Strength of Stones , has received critical acclaim , and at the end of 1995 , she sold two more books . <p> Many of Nina 's characters recur in her work . Tasha and Terry , the twins in this self-contained novella , also appear in two delightful novels ( which are among the handful of books Nina has in her office awaiting rewrites ) . " Airborn " also inspired our beautiful Bob Eggleton cover . <p> IF I HAD TO PICK MY FAVORITE way of going home , I would n't choose the one I was traveling now . It would be more fun to come home for Christmas  --  where I could look forward to spending time with my twin sister and my parents , and the emotional atmosphere would be hey , let 's have fun , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . And afterward I could leave again , heading back to my own place . <p> Not like now . Scooting up Oregon back roads in my tiny antique Honda , I had most of my independence squirreled around me ; my clarinet case bumped my heels whenever I took my feet off the pedals . I was going home in half-defeat . I had moved away from home at seventeen , finding an apartment in Spores Ferry , a major town an hour away from the small town of Atwell where I grew up . I was n't even eighteen yet , and I had to move back to my parents ' house . <p> I had made a promise to the powers of air that I would learn about them and become their disciple if they helped me through something I could n't have survived myself , and they had delivered . The teacher I needed lived in Atwell . <p> So : I was on my way home , on my way back to school . <p> Cultivated fields spread out from the road , their green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sourgrass Hill to look at the Crooks Farm produce stand . It was autumn , and fruits and vegetables were ripe . Maybe I should bring Mom some apples as a hostess gift . It would reinforce my guest status in the house where I had grown up , be a pledge that I planned a visit , not a lifetime . <p> A man stood beside the road , his thumb out . He wore moccasins , dusty leather pants , and a fringed leather jacket . A beat-up narrow-brimmed hat sat low on his head . His scraggly dark hair came down to his shoulders , and his face , as tanned as the leather he was wearing , made his pale green eyes look like lights at night . H e stared at me and I heard a whisper of music in my mind , the faint squeal of a fiddle . I felt sparks traveling along my muscles My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter , turned the wheel toward the man . <p> I shook my head , pulled myself together , and drove on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had I been thinking ? There was no room in the car . Besides , the guy gave me the creeps . He looked too much like a maniac from stories after lights-out at camp . <p> In the rear-view mirror I saw a big gold car pull over . The leather man climbed into the back without even speaking to the driver . <p> I picked up as much speed as I could . Whispers sounded around me , but I could n't make out the words . If I had my air powers already , maybe I could have strengthened the voices so I would know what they were talking about . <p> The big gold car passed me on an uphill climb , and I saw those pale eyes in that dark face staring out the rear window at me . They burned their image into my mind so that I kept seeing them even after the car was out of sight over the hill . <p> Atwell had n't changed since the spring , except the leaves on the maples along Main had grown bigger and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cinemart was different . <p> When I reached my parents ' street , everybody 's cars were gone from the driveway of our white one-story house . More was probably clerking at the flower store where she worked , Dad worked nights at the local two star restaurant , and might have been home at noon on a Saturday , but he was n't ; there were lots of places my twin sister Terry might be . <p> I got out the key I 'd taken off my key ring for four months of freedom in Spores and unlocked the door . <p> The smells of burnt toast , fabric softener , and dust greeted me , whispering that there was no escape from home . Still standing on the front stoop , I closed the door , took a deep breath of outside air , and opened the door again , looking at our front hall . There was the occasional table with its stack of opened and discarded mail , and the coat rack so deep in coats it looked like a hugfest , with Terry 's tennis racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck shoes stood in an orderly line against the wall . Mom was preparing for the rams early . The skittery brown runner carpet lay there on the hardwood floor , waiting to slip out from under the unwary . <p> Carrying my purse and my clarinet , I stepped over the threshold . This did n't look like the house of a powerful witch ( my sister ) or even a halfway witch ( me ) . I wondered if Mom and Dad had figured out about that yet . When Terry and I were cursed with witchcraft by a semi-benevolent ghost on our twelfth Halloween , we had agreed without even discussing it not to tell Mom and Dad . We practised in private . When we found our mentor , Natalya Clayton , we told our parents we had joined Adopt-a-Grandmother to explain why we spent so much time at her house . We called Natalya Gran to help maintain the fiction . Our parents never even figured out Natalya was the principal of Atwell Middle School  --  they were n't big on PTA meetings or Open House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night a lot , Mom and Dad did n't say much . But then , they had never kept a very close eye on us . <p> I went on through the kitchen , glancing at the stack of dirty dishes clustered around the sink . I checked my power reservoir . I had been practicing channeling lately , inviting power to come to me , welcoming it , storing it , taking it out to stroke so that we would get to know each other and work well together . A fraction of it , a little white dart of power , would clean those dishes and put them away . <p> On the other hand , I should start as I meant to go on ; none of those dishes were mine . I went through the laundry room to the servants ' quarters , two little rooms in the back of the house just big enough for a bed , bedside table , and a dresser each , with a shared closet in the middle . Terry had the right room , and I had the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's clothes until we did n't know what belonged to whom ; by the time we reached ten , though , we had sorted ourselves out . She turned tomboy and I went Laura Ashley . <p> When I saw Terry two weeks before in Spores , she had changed again , wearing stylish clothes in strong single colors . Her short dark hair had been cut by a professional instead of by her standing in the bathroom and checking it out in the mirror as she went , or by me , same place , with her growling at me every time I tried something fancy . I still had long dark hair which I curled , and was still wearing ruffly things with little flowers all over them , and I felt stupid . When I saw kids my age on the street I felt like a visitor from another time . I felt I was ready for neon , but it was hard to redefine myself . <p> My room still had its orange and yellow butterfly kite hanging from the ceiling , its ribbon tail tacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dresser , I could tell nobody had been in there since I left . <p> I put my clarinet and my purse on the dresser . I opened the window , which looked out on the back patio , Dad 's rusty barbecue , the lawn , and the stained wood fence around the yard . I held my hands out , palms up , and said , " Powers of air , I welcome you . I invite you . Be with me in this place . " <p> A breath of air blew across my palms . <p> " Thank you , " I said . I sat on the bed , closed my eyes , and thought about my power reservoir . I released a tiny dart of power , instructing it to chase away the dirt and dust in the room and leave everything smelling like sunlight on morning grass . Unlike the dishes , my room was my responsibility . When I opened my eyes the room was cleaner than it had ever been before . The butterfly kite sparkled like sunrise above me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was it ? " said Terry from the threshold . <p> I jumped about a foot . " Where 'd you come from ? " <p> " I was studying in my room . " <p> " But your car  --  " <p> "  --  is in the shop . Oil change . I thought you were n't getting in till about three . " <p> " It did n't take as long to pack as I thought it would . " <p> " Not if you only brought your clarinet , " she said , and grinned . " Did your boyfriend help ? " <p> " Not during the day . " <p> " I forgot . " <p> I gripped one hand in the other , remembering saying goodbye to Danny in my Spores Ferry apartment just before dawn that morning . He had said , " Are you sure you want to do this ? " <p> " Yes , " I told him . <p> A breeze had sneaked in and lifted a strand of my hair . I held up my hand and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? Already I have in ends . " <p> He reached out and the whirlwind brushed his fingers . His eyebrows rose . " Well , okay , " he said , " but I 'm saving the apartment for you . " <p> I hugged him hard . " Wherever I am , you 're welcome , " I said , letting formality touch my voice . I wanted to make it a binding invitation for both of us . <p> " Atwell may be out of my range . " <p> " We have a nice dark basement . " <p> " Heh , " he said , his eyes laughing . Then he sat up . " The day is troubling my blood , " he said . " I have to go . " He kissed me , turned to mist , and flowed out my window , seeping down the side of the building and into his basement apartment , where he would sleep the sleep of death all day . <p> I had stood in the middle of my apartment after he left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was magic in the world , but I had never seen any . At eleven , I was n't so sure anymore . At twelve , I had met that ghost . . . . After that , everything went wild . It was difficult for me to see the world as flat , understandable , predictable , the way I almost had at eleven . Now , every time I looked hard at anything , it turned surprising . <p> I had looked at Danny a lot . <p> Packing , I had taken only half my things . The apartment stayed mine ; my landlord had told me so . <p> I had come home in half-defeat , half-victory , because I still had my own place , away from home . <p> " I 'll help you unload the car , " said Terry . <p> We went outside and fished things out of my car . " Oof , " said Terry , scraping her side as she pulled a book box out from behind the seat . " This job could be a lot easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low profile in this neighborhood , " I said , lifting out my Rabbit Track Maranta plant by its hook . That was one of our teacher 's basic principles : keep your craft quiet . <p> Terry rubbed her side and smiled at me . " Just checking . " She stacked one box on another and carried them into the house . <p> " Checking what ? " I yelled after her . <p> One of our neighbors walked by , a golden retriever on a leash dragging him . <p> " Whether you 're practicing your disciplines , " Terry yelled back . I held the plant above the dog 's nose range and patted him . The neighbor smiled at me and moved on . <p> Terry and I unloaded the rest of my things in silence . We put everything on the floor of my room except my plant and my suitcase . The plant went on top of my sparkling clean dresser with my clarinet , and the suitcase I set on my bed . I opened it . " Have you been keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the bed beside my suitcase . " Very quiet . I barely do anything at home anymore . Mom and Dad have been looking at me sideways lately . They keep wondering why you left . I guess Dad 's feeling guilty because he never saw it coming , but then , who did ? " <p> I was n't sure even I had seen it coming . It had surprised me when I decided to leave home . I had never done anything without Terry before . But I had awakened one morning in my little room thinking that as soon as I stepped out my bedroom door Terry would be on my case about how I was n't practicing anything enough and did I want to be a halfway witch , what was <p> wrong with me ? The only place I felt comfortable and safe anymore was sleep . And I had thought : I can go somewhere else . I can get away from this . I can . <p> Life spread out in front of me like a carrying sea , promising distances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was glad to go . It was the right thing to do , <p> I had to make coming back the right thing to do , too . <p> " So where do you practice ? " I asked . <p> " I found a game trail that goes up the side of Owl Butte . For people without flashlights or night eyes it 's awfully hard to find after dark . I put a blur on it after I go up . It leads to a clearing halfway up the butte . I 've put wards around the clearing  --  no sign anybody else has been using it in the past twenty years  --  and I work there . I 'll take you tonight if you want . " <p> " I 'm not sure yet , " I said , putting shirts , skirts , and dresses on hangers . <p> " Discipline , " said Terry , nagging again already . <p> I frowned into the closet . I planned to be disciplined , but if she nagged me about it , I might , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and my promise to air . Getting her to stop nagging would be hard , though ; she had the habit . I shoved her clothes sideways on the bar in the closet , hung mine up , then collected myself and faced her . " I do n't know what disciplines I 'll be practicing yet . I have to see Gran . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " I have a direction now , " I said . " I 've consecrated myself to the powers of air . " <p> Terry frowned ferociously at me . <p> I emptied the rest of my suitcase 's contents into dresser drawers , looked at my boxes , and sighed . " I think I want to go see Gran now , " I said . <p> " I 'll call , " said Terry . She went to phone in the kitchen . <p> I studied myself in the mirror behind the plant on my dresser . My hair had wilted since the morning session with blow dryer and curling brush . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushed my hair back , and fastened it into a ponytail . I studied the black eyeliner around my eyes . It brought out the blue , all right , but it made me look like I had n't gotten enough sleep , which I had n't . My skin was pale , which made my blusher stand out too much , and I 'd fretted most of the lipstick tiff my lips . <p> I closed my eyes and called forth a tiny silver of power , asking it to lift the makeup off my face . Heat kissed my cheeks , my eyes and mouth . I opened my eyes . Without eyeliner , mascara , and shadow , my eyes looked small and defenseless . I frowned with my pale lips , shook my head . Air probably would n't care what I looked like . <p> " She 's expecting us  --  " Terry said from the door , then paused , her eyes widening . <p> " What ? " <p> " I just have n't seen you naked like that in a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows were thicker and darker than mine , and she had more natural color . <p> We were identical . How could she have more of something ? Maybe she disciplined her way into it ? <p> " Well , " I said , and shrugged . " Let 's take my car . " <p> Natalya Clayton lived in a big old house on the edge of town . It was painted slate blue and had a black roof and front porch , and all kinds of little gray knick-knacky bits here and there . <p> When we pulled up at Natalya 's that Saturday afternoon , the house lay sleeping in the sun . The pre-settlement maple in Natalya 's front yard towered above the house . Its leaves were still green ; we were shy of the valleys first frost . <p> Natalya was in her front yard , spading up earth . She straightened when we got to the gate . Her black eyes were bright , and her silver hair , most of it in a bun , made a little haze around her head " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped her gardening gloves on the ground and came to hug me . <p> She was so small m my arms , warm as a bird , and strong . For a moment I hugged her with my eyes closed . When I opened them , I was looking toward the big maple , and I saw pale eyes looking back at me . " Oh ! " I said , releasing Natalya . <p> " What ? " she asked . <p> " The Leather Man , " I said , peering toward the maple . He had been standing beside the trunk , but now he was gone . <p> Natalya frowned . " Where did you learn that name ? " <p> " Is that a name ? I saw a man all dressed in leather , hitchhiking . " <p> Her eyes widened . " Where ? " <p> " On Sourgrass Hill . " I should have bought fruit for Natalya , too . An apple for the teacher . " I almost stopped for him , but there was no room in the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he 's gone again . " <p> She looked toward the tree a long considering moment , then at me . " Just as well , " she said . " Tasha , you 've changed . There 's order in you . " <p> " I hope you 'll accept me as a pupil again . I 'm ready to learn and apply myself now . " <p> " Let 's have tea , " she said , which was how all our lessons started . She led us into the house . <p> " I think she 's nuts , " Terry told Natalya as we sipped hibiscus tea at the big brown table in the kitchen . <p> I took my last sip of tea and banded my cup to Natalya . She studied the leaves in the bottom . " No , she 's correct , " said Natalya . " She has been granted a boon , and she offers payment . All in alignment with the principles of order . Tasha , I do n't know the special mysteries of the powers of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide . " <p> " How many witches can there be in a town this size , Gran ? " <p> " You might be surprised . But I 'm not talking about a witch guide . You need a totem , an animal you can study and learn from . What you are proposing is one of the most severe disciplines possible  --  not the craft , more like the priesthood . It will offer you different gifts and satisfactions from the ones you could have received if you had followed the craft . " <p> I felt a sinking sensation in my stomach . She made it sound like this was going to be so strict . I was n't good at strict . I had agreed to do this on my own . Nobody had suggested it to me . I had never even heard of someone doing it , actually , dedicating themselves to serving a power instead of learning the power and making it serve them . <p> I took a couple of deep breaths and felt stronger . " Gosh , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Terry and I were eleven , we had been normal . Mostly . <p> " Beware of wishes , " said Natalya . <p> " What if I fail ? What if I flunk ? This sounds so hard , Gran . " <p> She gave me her widest smile . " Yes , child . The best possible thing for you , I think . I had given up hope , but now I feel hope renewed . " <p> " Will it take the rest of my life ? " <p> She lifted an index finger . " Do n't look so far ahead . First enhance your relationship with air . Then consult with it . A direction will come to you when you work with your element . " <p> " How can I , uh , enhance my relationship with air ? " I said , feeling like laughing and crying . What could you do with air ? Breathe it , right ? If you were lucky , you could n't even see it . <p> " Meditate . Focus . Seek to commune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , " I said . I had never been good at sitting and waiting for something to happen , and I was even worse at sitting and waiting for nothing to happen . <p> " Well , do n't whine about it . Get back in practice . " <p> I felt defeated . " Okay , " I said . " What do I do first ? " <p> TERRY TOLD ME the w hole thing was silly all the way back to our house . I drove without responding to her . The box of incense Natalya had given me lay in my skirt pocket against my thigh . <p> " Honestly , Tasha , give it up , " said Terry as I parked the car in front of the house . " You do n't have the discipline to  --  " <p> Shut up , I thought . <p> She choked and put her hand to her throat , then looked at me , her eyes wide . She straggled for breath . <p> No ! I thought . Forget that ? <p> She pulled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without saying anything else and headed up the walk , not glancing back . <p> I sat behind the wheel of my car , wondering whether I should get out at all or just drive away . How could I do that to her ? <p> How could I ? I did n't know how to do anything like that . Maybe she just choked or something . <p> She was strong in her craft , a serious practitioner , with style and class . She would n't just choke . She would n't allow herself to . <p> I got out of the car , slamming the door behind me , and followed my sister into the house . " What happened ? " I yelled . <p> " Do n't talk to me . " She vanished into her room , slamming the door . <p> I went into my room and put the box of incense on top of my dresser . There was n't a calm system in my body . I did n't think I was ready to lie down and meditate yet . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too bad about setting precedents ; sometimes you just needed to do housework . I searched through the fridge and the cupboards to see what there was for dinner , and put together a salad and a tuna casserole . <p> Mom walked in while I was setting the table . " Oh , baby , " she said , coming to kiss the back of my neck , a favorite target of hers . " It 's nice to come home to you . " <p> " Honestly ? " <p> " Oh , yes ! I 've missed you . " <p> " You had the good twin at home . " <p> " Do n't be silly , " said Mom . She put a handful of roses she 'd brought home into a vase , grabbed a wedge of lettuce from the salad bowl and munched on it . " Terry 's the bad twin . What have you got in the oven ? It smells good . " She went and peeked . " Yum , " she said . <p> " Where 's Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More glanced over her shoulder at me , her eyebrows drawing together above her nose . " He was going to do some shopping " she said , her voice vaguing out . " He wants to build some shelves for the living room . " <p> " Well , I got here at noon and he was n't here , and then Terry and I went out for a while . Maybe he came back and got ready for work and left again . " <p> " Mmm , could be , " said More . " When is it dinner ? " <p> " Half an hour , " I said . I put a towel over the salad and stored it in the fridge . <p> " Is the bad twin home ? " <p> " Uh huh . She 's in her room . " <p> " Are you fighting already ? " <p> I looked at her , surprised . <p> " Well , if you guys were feeling good toward another , would n't you be working together , and talking twice as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " <p> " I guess we would , " I said . <p> " What 's the plan , now that you 're back , anyway ? Are you going to school ? Would you get left back a grade , or just go on to senior year ? " <p> " I only dropped out a month before the end of the semester , " I said . " I do n't really know . " I was n't sure how many hours a day my new discipline would take . It occurred to me that it was n't something that would put food on the table , either , as far as I could tell . I would need other skills . " Maybe I should go back to school . Mom , do you use anything you learned in high school in your dally life ? " <p> " Not the geometry or the algebra , " she said , getting out some crackers . " History , English , science , occasionally a little French , yes . " <p> " Oh . " Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left us . I 'd put a hole in mine , renting the apartment in Danny 's building , and I should keep paying him rent if he was going to keep the apartment for me ; otherwise that was lost revenue for him . If I finished high school this year , I could move back to Spores and go to college , for as long as I could afford to . Which , after another year 's rent , might not be too long . <p> " Do you use anything you learned in college in daily life , Mom ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . She was slicing cheese . <p> " I need to make some money , " I said , <p> " College can help you there , too , " said Mom . " Have you figured out what kind of career you want ? " <p> If air and I had an enhanced relationship  --  " Maybe I 'll fly planes . " <p> " Well , that certainly came out of the blue . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sit with me and tell me what 's been happening with you , " said Mom , putting a plate of crackers and cheese in the middle of the table . " Did you enjoy life in the big city ? " <p> " Big city ? Ha ! " <p> " Okay , but what did you do ? " <p> " Not very much , " I said . " I set up my apartment . I tried painting , but I 'm lousy at it . I walked around and looked at things . I went to yard sales . I checked a lot of books out of the library and read them . I went swimming in the river . I went to the country fair and the county fair . I sat in on a couple of courtroom sessions . " I helped my friends solve a murder mystery , but that did n't seem like something I should tell my mother . " I have a boyfriend . If he comes up to visit , can he stay in the basement ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had a guest room down there . It was damp and dark , but it had a bed and there was a half bath . <p> " Thanks , Mom . His name is Danny and he works nights and sleeps days . " <p> " Works nights at what ? " <p> " Motel clerk . " <p> She blinked . " Well , that 's nice , " she said . She looked out the window over the sink for a little while , then turned to me . " So what happened ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " You had this undemanding bohemian lifestyle all arranged , and you ca n't have spent all your money yet , unless there 's something you 're not telling me . What happened to change your mind ? What brings you home ? Not that I 'm not glad to have you , but I am curious . " <p> " You 've never been curious before .

I just need to be here for a while . Is that okay ? " <p> " I told you on the phone . It 's fine for you to stay as long as you like . If you reach age thirty-five I may start charging rent . Never doubt your welcome , Tasha . I 'll keep your room for you . I might park a guest there once in a while , but it 'll stay yours . " <p> " Thanks , More " I got up and hugged her . What she said touched me more than I had expected it to . <p> " For goodness ' sake , you 're not even technically an adult yet , Tash . And people in my family , we 're often late bloomers  --  do n't know what we 're going to do with our lives until much later . I have n't settled on a career yet , and I 'm thirty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years . . . . As long as I can afford to give you room , I 'll do it . " Her voice sank to a whisper . " Also , maybe you could figure out what 's going on with Terry . She spends too much time in her room . Hugh 's been calling her every evening but she has n't gone out with him in months . " <p> " What ? Jeeze ! I thought they were the perfect couple . " <p> " Something 's burning ; " said Terry , standing in the doorway to the laundry room . <p> I let go of More and went to the oven . Only the edges of the casserole were too far gone to salvage . If Terry and I had been alone , we could hart . fixed it . If she had n't mentioned anything , I could have fixed it before More noticed , or Terry could have . I wondered if she had said it out of spite . <p> " I guess it 's dinner , " I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down . <p> I put the casserole dish on a trivet on the table . The oven 's timer began chiming . I glanced at the temperature setting , and it was right where it should have been . I turned the oven off , standing a little while with its heat moving up past my face , and thinking . Terry must have deliberately burned my casserole . Did she want to get back at me ? <p> Maybe she needed an excuse to speak to me again after what had happened in the car . I had forgotten . <p> I sat at the table across from my sister . Her face was in neutral . <p> Mom dished up food for the three of us , the way she had when we were little . " How about a game of Ghost ? " she said . <p> We made faces at her . <p> " Good enough , " she said . " I 'd rather you teamed up against me than sat there resenting each other . " <p> " Oh , More , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't resent her , " I said . " I just wish she 'd stop telling me I 'm silly and I have no discipline . " <p> " I think that 's her job , " Mom said . <p> " Well , I 'm firing her then . " I turned to Terry . " You hear me ? " <p> Terry nodded . " Besides , maybe I was wrong . " She touched her throat . <p> Inside me I felt something that had been sitting there armed and poised to shoot relax . I took a big breath , and noticed  --  <p> The air tasted so strong . It carried the taste of burnt dinner and vinegar salad dressing and roses , and underneath that there was a power like cold fresh water . I drank the air , and its strength spread through me . I felt as if I had never breathed before . I stared wide-eyed across the table at my twin . She paused , a forkful of lettuce halfway to her mouth , and looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I kept breathing tasting air and dinner , the age of our house , the warmth of my mother and the many pollens she carried on her skin and clothes from working all day with flowers , ancient book dust Terry had brought into the kitchen on her fingers , the chill of white enamel from the sink , the heat still trickling from the oven , the ghosts of dirt that people had tracked into the house all year from their varied journeys , even my own dirt with a whiff of Spores Ferry and Danny 's basement edging it . <p> " Are n't you going to eat anything ? " Mom asked . <p> " I  --  " I said . " I 'm not really hungry . " Then I shook my head . That did n't make sense . I took a bite of salad . It did n't have very much taste  --  not after the banquet I 'd been tasting on the air . Besides , my stomach felt full , even though I had n't had anything to eat since breakfast aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I 'll have some leftovers later , " I said . Maybe my stomach would come to its senses . " Mom , what did you do today ? " <p> She told us about the flowers she had put together for a wedding . <p> After dinner Terry volunteered to do the dishes and I went to my room . I closed and locked the door , then opened the window wide to the night and unlatched the screen . If I was going to have an animal teacher , I wanted it to be able to get to me . <p> I set a burning votive candle in a red glass on my bedside table . I put a brick of incense on a saucer and lit it , saying whatever came into my head , something like , " Air , I thank you for your gifts of safety , of food  --  " my stomach still had n't growled , so I figured that somehow air had fed me  --  " of life . I offer you this scent and hope it pleases you . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , my hands crossed over my stomach . I drew in deep draughts of air . " I do n't know how to work with you , " I murmured , closing my eyes . " I ask that you send me a teacher so that I can learn your mysteries and desires , the better to serve you . Grant me whatever it is right for me to have at this time . " <p> I lay and breathed , tasting night grass and evergreens , car exhaust , somebody 's barbecue , maple leaves , burning fields , river water . It was the meditation Natalya had suggested . Breathing . " Breathe in for a slow count of eight , hold it for a count of eight , and breathe out for a slow count of eight . Try to be conscious of how the air moves through you , in your blood , nourishing your body . Think thanks . " <p> So I did that . At first I thought , this is taking a long time . Then I lost track of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became aware of whispering voices near me , and a time after that I heard words they had probably been saying over and over . " Your tote m is here , " they whispered to me . <p> I opened heavy eyelids . Danny 's face was just above mine , red light from the candle flickering across his features . He was smiling the gentlest smile I had ever seen I lifted my hand and touched his lips . <p> " Missed you , " he murmured against my hand . <p> For some reason I thought that was the most beautiful thing anybody had ever said to me . I lay and stared up at him for a while , feeling the strange unbreathing warmth of his face against my hand  --  he only drew in breath when he wanted to talk  --  and I started to notice something else about him , that air was mixing with his edges somehow , but before I could concentrate on that , I sat up , looking around , feeling alarmed . " Is there an animal here ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he said . <p> " I 'm supposed to have a totem . Air told me . " I glanced past him . In the red and white light of the candle all I saw was my kite , the thin gentle thread of smoke rising from the incense , and Danny , kneeling beside the bed . <p> He looked around too . " I 'm not sure I understand . " <p> I explained what Natalya had told me . " I 'm supposed to study my totem and learn from it how to interact with the powers of air . Maybe it 's a fly . " I looked at the ceiling . <p> " I would know , " he said . " There 's nobody in the room bat us . Although . . . " He glanced toward the closet . " Two doors away , somebody with a heat signature a lot like yours . Terry , I guess . And a couple rooms that way  --  " he pointed toward the laundry room and the kitchen beyond - " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his shoulder , took a deep breath , tasting . Listening . " Your totem is here , " whispered the voices . Air sifted in and out of Danny 's body as though he were n't really solid . <p> " You 're my totem , " I said , and hugged Danny , who felt solid enough . " I get to study you ! Finally , homework I like ! " <p> " What ' " <p> I let go of him and looked around . " What if he does n't want to be my totem ? " I asked the air . <p> The whispers had died away . <p> " Can I study you ? " I asked Danny . <p> " Well . There are things about me I 'd rather you did n't know . " <p> " But those things do n't have anything to do with air , right ? " <p> " I do n't even breathe most of the time . I think you got a bum steer . I 've never been certain there was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to convince him the way I had convinced Terry . Come to think , that would n't work anyway . I took three deep breaths , trying to taste an answer . Danny had a spicy flavor , like dusty sage and moonlight . I could feel the strength of the air flowing through me , traveling all the roads of my blood . Air wrapped around me like armor , invisible but strong . <p> I lifted my hand , bending it back so that the inside of my wrist crowned . " Have you eaten feasted on air , and I knew the taste of it was in my blood . <p> He sat beside me on the bed and lifted my wrist to his mouth . His lips were soft and warm against my skin . I did n't even feel the nip that broke the skin , but I felt his tongue tasting me , and the warmth of my bloodflow . I closed my eyes and relaxed , all my attention focused on the give-and-take . It felt good . <p> Terry could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to explain . Such a hazy cloud of stigmata surrounded this kind of exchange ; I could n't fight my way past all the words . I just knew inside that it was all right . <p> Soon  --  much sooner than other times we had shared blood  --  Danny stopped and pressed his fingers against the little wound , halting tee flow of blood his saliva had freed . " Tash , " he said in a hushed voice , " it 's so strong . It 's so rich . It 's enough . What happened ? " <p> " It 's air , " I said . " Do you understand ? " <p> " No , " he said , " but I believe you now . " <p> We sat in the flickering light a little longer , his arm around my shoulders , my hand gripping his , me breathing  --  feeling the air support me , driving out the lassitude I usually felt after sharing blood with Danny  --  and he silent . At last he took a breath and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you okay ? " <p> " Yeah . Just weird . " He turned his head . " The woman is coming . " <p> I switched on the light on my bedside table . We both blinked . I blew out the candle . " Tasha ? " said Mom 's voice outside the door . " I thought I heard voices ? " <p> I slipped out of Danny 's arm and went to unlock the door and let her in . <p> " Mom , this is Danny , my boyfriend I told you about . " <p> " Oh , my , " she said . <p> He stood up , pushed his heavy dark hair back of his shoulders , and smiled at her . <p> " Danny , my morn , Rebecca Dane . " <p> Danny rubbed his hand on his black jeans and held it out . Mom shook it . " Please , " said Mom , and swallowed , " call me Becky . " <p> Mom had never had that nickname before . This was spooky . I imagined seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little overwhelming , pale-skinned and beautiful , wiry and intense . He had told me once he thought high-voltage charm was part of the whole vampire package they needed it to survive . It had stopped hitting me so hard , maybe since he knew I was n't a threat , and he did n't have to charm me into feeding him . <p> " And it 's nice of you to come visit , " said Mom , swallowing again , " but I would appreciate it if you 'd use the front door in the future . " <p> " Okay , " he said . " Nice to meet you , Becky . " <p> Terry , rubbing her eyes , wandered in behind Mom . " Danny , " she said . " Hi . " <p> " Hi , Terry . " <p> " This is meditation ? " Terry asked me . <p> " Danny 's my totem . " <p> " Oh , boy , " said Terry , " I wish I could dream up a scheme like that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know Danny ? " <p> " Sure . I met him when I went down to Spores to visit Tasha a couple weeks ago . " <p> " What does ' totem ' mean ? " Mom asked me . <p> " Danny 's going to help me study , " I said . <p> " That 's not what I asked , Tash . Is this some new high school way of referring to something parents are n't supposed to know ? What does ' totem ' mean ? " <p> " He 's , like , my spirit guide in my study . In my quest . " <p> " I do n't like the sound of this , " Mom said . She glanced at Danny , who was looking at me , eyebrows up . <p> " More , why are you being such a parent ? " asked Terry . " I mean , why now ? You never noticed anything we did before . " <p> " Time I started , then . " Mom 's gaze flicked to Danny , then to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tash ? " <p> " I 'm studying air . " <p> " Something you ca n't find in Spores ? " <p> " Gran 's helping me study it , and she lives here . " <p> " And now Danny 's helping you study it ? And he lives . . . in Spores ? " <p> " I 'm confused too , " I said . <p> Mom put her hands on my shoulders and stared into my eyes . " Tash , does this have anything to do with drugs ? " <p> " Absolutely nothing . Zip . Zero . " <p> " Promise , cross your heart ? " <p> " I promise . " I made an X across my chest with an index finger . <p> " Is this going to hurt your health ? " I shook my head . <p> " I mean , you did n't eat your dinner . " <p> " Yes , but I 'm okay . " <p> " You 're not on methamplifiers that suppress your appetite ? " <p> " Mom ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you need a spirit guide to study air ? Are you trying to put something over on me ? " <p> I drew in breath , trying to taste answers . Somebody else 's cooking was on the air . Danny stepped forward , touched my shoulder , looked past all of us toward the kitchen . <p> " Where is everybody ? " asked Dad 's voice from the kitchen . <p> " Out here , " Terry called . <p> He was untying his bow-tie as he came into my room , which already had too many people in it . <p> " Tasha ? " Dad said , blinking at me . " This is a surprise ! " <p> " Hi , Dad , " I said . <p> He eeled past Mom and Terry and gave me a hug . He smelled like heavily garlicked spaghetti sauce , and pepperoni ; I savored the taste the air carried , felt it filling me again . I realized Danny had backed away from both of us . I looked over my shoulder at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powers of air . Can I take a scent out of me instead of taking it in ? I took a deep breath , counting eight as I drew in air . I held it for awhile , imagining all the molecules of garlic gathering in it , and then I released it , a slow count , toward my wall and away from Danny . <p> " Are you okay ? " Dad asked . <p> " Huh ? " I felt garlic- free . I also felt ravenous . " Starving , " I said . " Dad , this is my friend Danny , from Spores Ferry . " <p> " Pleased to meet you , son , " said Dad , holding out his hand . I thought about air deciding not to carry any garlic from Dad to Danny and watched them shake hands . Danny did n't even wince . I was n't certain if that was because of my protection , or because his manners were too good for him to display discomfort . Dad said , " Why are you all having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen make more sense ? " <p> " Sure would , " said Terry , yawning into the back of her hand . <p> My stomach growled . I thought about burnt leftover casserole or too-long dressed salad . Nope . A piece of bread , maybe . Toast . <p> I heard whispers riding the air , but there was n't enough quiet for me to understand them . Morn , Terry , and Dad headed out the door . Danny gripped my shoulder . " What are you doing ? " he whispered . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " There are smells here , but they 're avoiding me . I sensed the sulfur go into you and come out again . " <p> " That 's better , is n't it ? You do n't like it . " <p> " What makes you think you need a guide on this quest ? You seem to be handling everything just fine . " <p> I turned and put my arms around him . " No , " I whispered , " no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air wants from me yet . You must have something to teach me , too . " <p> " Okay , " he murmured , hugging me back . Then , " Your parents do n't know about you and Terry ? " <p> " Not a clue , " I muttered to his chest . <p> " Kind of complicates things , huh ? " <p> " It never used to matter . They were so wrapped up in each other we could do anything we liked . Something must have happened . " <p> " Tasha ! " Mom yelled from the kitchen . <p> We went out and joined the others . I found some pretzels before I sat down . I was hearing whispers still , but I was n't calm enough to decipher them . <p> " Cocoa ? " Dad asked me , then glanced at Mom , Terry , and Danny . <p> " None for me , thanks , " said Danny . <p> " I 'm up for some , " Terry said , and More nodded . I sat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . The big question m my brain was whether More was going to pursue her uncharacteristic line of questioning . I had already told her the truth . I wondered whether I should come up with plausible-sounding lies instead . <p> " Danny , will you be spending the night ? " Mom asked . <p> Dad , at the stove , turned and stared at her . <p> " It 's a long drive back to Spores , and we do have a guest room in the basement , " Mom continued . <p> " Tasha mentioned it . I think I had better go home tonight . Got ta work tomorrow night , and I need my rest in a familiar place . Right now I 'm wide awake , though , these are my normal hours . I 'll be fine to drive . " <p> " In what way could you be a spirit guide for Tasha ? " Mom said , puncturing my suspense about whether she was going to grill us anymore . <p> " I 'm not sure . Maybe it has something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only subjects I can think of that I could help her with . " <p> " What 's spiritual about that ? " <p> " I do n't know . " He glanced at me . " There 's a lot we do n't know yet . " <p> Dad said , " For heaven 's sake , Rebecca , why do n't you ask them meaningful questions ? Are you kids using protection ? " <p> " Dad ! " I yelled . <p> Terry almost fell out of her chair laughing . She laughed so hard she ended up coughing . <p> Dad stared at Danny right across Terry 's laughter . <p> " We have n't exactly , " Danny said , " gotten that far . " <p> " Do n't kid a kidder , son . I 'm not blind . " <p> Danny frowned and looked at me . I put down my pretzel and pulled in breath . Something had happened in the room , chasing all the taste of champagne bubble lightness out of it , cranking up the tension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , wondering if the metal edge of unease was just from parents who did n't want to think of their kids as sexual beings or from something else . I glanced at Mom . She tasted of the gentle salt of tears . I licked the air again , and got another faint taste from Dad , under all his own scents of Italian cookery , aftershave , flesh , fabric  --  a whisper of perfume , not Mom 's . Protection  --  against what ? I turned and stared into Danny 's eyes . " I want to go home , " I whispered . <p> Under the table , he took my hand . <p> Terry 's laughter finally stopped . She jumped up and got herself a glass of water , drinking it in smooth gulps to settle herself . " What happened ? " she asked everybody . <p> It was so strange . Dad 's betrayal lay on the table between us , and I knew , and Mom knew , and Dad knew , and even , I thought , Danny knew somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to pretend it was n't there . I was n't sure I would even tell Terry in private . <p> Whispers scraped at my awareness . In the silence following Terry 's question I breathed carefully , keeping count , and listened to the whispers . " Everything can be encompassed , " they said . <p> I wanted to tell them to shut up , to choke on it , because I was sitting here with my heart laid open by a dull blade and I was n't going to detour around that fact . <p> " Everything can be encompassed , " they said again . <p> I lost control of my breathing , heard my breath hissing in and out of my nose . Anger was a red ball of fire lodged just below my throat . <p> So they had never been the most attentive parents . That had worked out all right for Terry and me . At least we could watch them being in love with each other . How dare Dad mess up what we had , even if it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on my head . " Breathe it out , " he said . <p> " What ? " I gasped . <p> He tapped my chest just below my clavicle  --  right where my anger burned . " Breathe it out , " he said . <p> I panted for a moment , then closed my eyes . I let out a very long breath , feeding the fire to it . I felt fire leave me , traveling on air . I felt like a dragon and wondered if I were scorching anything . When I drew in my next breath , it was full of cool strength . It flowed through me , calming me . Everything could be encompassed . Stupid but true . <p> " What was that a demonstration of ? " Mom asked . <p> " It 's part of the study of air , Mom . Breathing . It 's like therapy . This is sooooo weird , " I said . " Thanks , Danny . " <p> " You 're welcome , " he said , subdued . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us and grabbing our shoulders . " What ? " <p> " Her heat signature went nova , " Danny said . He stood up , slipping out of Terry 's grasp . " Tash , I have to go . I 've got another free night Monday . I 'll be back , if you do n't come down to Spores . Good night , all . " He kissed my forehead and slipped out of the room and the house . <p> " What does that mean , heat signature ? " Mom asked . <p> " What is this jargon ? I had no idea I was so out of touch . " <p> " I 'm going to bed , " I said . <p> " Not before you give me some answers , " Terry said , giving me her best wide-eyed glare . <p> I almost told her to shut up . Instead I put the pretzels back in the cupboard , brushed my teeth , went to my bedroom , lay down , and fell immediately asleep before she could terrorize me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showered , then put on one of my favorite dresses , a stretchy material made into a tight bodice and a flared mid-calf-length skirt , with a jewel-cut neckline . It was less neutral than most of my other clothes , cream-colored with strong sprigs of purple flowers and green leaves . I brushed out my hair and let it hang . Then I grabbed the stuff that hung down in front , took scissors out of a drawer , and chopped off hair until I had bangs . After that I looked different  --  not Tasha , not Terry . I looked like somebody I did n't know yet . I decided that was good . <p> In the kitchen , More was drinking coffee . " Are you going to tell me what 's really going on now ? " <p> " I 'm studying air , " I said . <p> " Tash ! " She hit the table with her fist , then winced . " Will you stop this nonsense and tell me what 's actually happening to you ? " <p> " But More  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " But Mom . . . " I sighed . " Do you want me to lie to you ? " <p> " No , dammit ! " <p> " The truth is that I 'm studying air . No lie . " <p> " All right , why are you studying air ? " <p> What could I tell her ? Well , I was in terrible trouble and air saved my life ? I 'm entering the priesthood ? Air is my god ? " Mom , " I said . I lifted a napkin from the holder in the middle of the table , and tore it into bits . " I ca n't really explain this . It goes back too far . But  --  " I threw the shreds of napkin up , and air held them . They swirled around and formed the pattern of a snowflake , then hung like washing on a line , rippling a little . " Air , " I said . I held up my hand , and the litterbits fluttered down to rest on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at my mother . <p> She had gone pale . Her eyes stared toward me , but they were n't focused on me . <p> " Mom ? " I said . <p> After a moment she clicked back to herself . " How did  --  what did  --  what  --  was that a trick ? " <p> I bit my lower lip . <p> " How could you possibly set up a trick like that ? " She held out her hand . " ' Give me those . " <p> I shook my head . " I will never defy the magician 's creed and reveal my secrets . " <p> " So you 're actually studying magic ? " <p> I took a deep breath , tasted it , let it out . " Yes , " I said . She meant magic tricks , and I meant magic , the real thing . I thought that was probably the best way to leave it . <p> " Why did n't you say so ? " <p> " Well , it 's air magic . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I feel so relieved , " she said . " This is much better than all the awful things I was imagining But I still do n't understand . " She sipped coffee and studied me . I got out some cereal and ate . Since last night I had n't figured out how to eat air again , and I thought maybe it was a good idea for me to eat food m front of Mom , who had enough to worry about . <p> " Would you like to go to church with me ? " Mom asked when I was almost done with my Cheerios . <p> I was going to say no , but a wind ruffled my bangs . " Okay , " I said . I had n't been to church in years . Maybe it would all be different . Maybe the air in a church would have something to teach me . <p> * * * <p> I stood next to my mother , breathing deep , tasting body scents , perfumes , oiled wood , and candle wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a random patch of magenta here , orange there , lime green on the back of someone else 's head . I felt the air spinning in my chest , and I waited . <p> The organ played four measures of a hymn . Throats opened all around me , and voices emerged . I gripped the pew-back in front of me . The excitation of the air ! The blending of purpose , the harmony and resonance . . . even with six or eight people off key . " Immortal , invisible , God only wise , " people sang . My mother held the hymnal out and nudged my shoulder . I lifted my voice too , feeling a strange and painful blossoming of beauty in my chest . Air entered me , left me , carrying song with it , my song mixing with everybody else 's , coloring the air , so that when I breathed in again the air carried a strange sustenance . I wanted the hymn to last forever . <p> I felt light and ripply . The music stroked me inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grip on the pew and forced my feet down . <p> The music cut off with an Amen and my weight settled on me again . <p> None of the other hymns during the service affected me in quite the same way as that first one , but they each had their own flavor , and each took me out of myself . One of them tasted like thick cold wintergreen syrup and actually made me cough . I tried holding my breath till the end . <p> While Morn went up for Communion , I stayed in our pew , kneeling and thinking . All morning I had been keeping my mind from thinking about Dad and what had happened the night before . Now I let myself know . <p> When I had called to ask if I could come back and stay at the house for a while , I had talked to Mom , assuming she would tell Dad  --  they were so close they shared everything ; they told each other everything they had done during the day , even if it was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had always felt like interruptions in their twoness , so we were glad we had each other . <p> Dad had been out yesterday afternoon , and he had been surprised to see me when he came home after work . So : Mom had n't told him I was coming back . <p> Dad had smelled like some other woman , and Mom had been crying . <p> Mom said Terry was acting strange . <p> Was everything at home falling apart ? <p> I noticed that my breathing had gotten shorter , and I slowed it . There was a strange taste to the air as people came back from the Communion railing and sat down to pray  --  a shift in body chemistry , almost a smell of sleep . Maybe just a sense of calm , mixed with the faint flavor of Communion wine . I breathed in the calmness . Everything could be encompassed . That was easy for air to say . Air was everywhere . Of course it could encompass everything . Surround , invade , possess . I felt the fire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathed it out . <p> Mom came back and knelt beside me . <p> The recessional at the end of the service was full of buoyancy . <p> On the walk home , Mom said , " I think I like your boyfriend . Whatever your relationship consists of . " After half a block , she said , " How on earth did you meet the night clerk of a hotel ? " <p> " He 's also my landlord . " <p> " Hmm , " said Mom . " Convenient . " <p> " It is kind of convenient , actually . Only . . . I do n't know what kind of relationship we have . It 's strange . We never say anything about love . I just like to spend time with him . " <p> " Maybe that 's a good place to stay for a while , " said Mom , and sighed . <p> We walked in silence for a block . " Mom , " I said . " What 's happening with you and Dad ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we got back to the house . I picked up the extension in the living room . " Hello ? " I said . <p> " This is Hugh , " said Terry 's boyfriend , his voice desperate . " Will you meet me ? Please ? " <p> " Sure , " I said . " Where. ? " <p> " The cemetery . Our favorite grave . " <p> " When ? " <p> " Now . Please . " <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> He hung up . <p> " Who was that ? " asked Mom . <p> " Hugh , " I said . " I 'm meeting him in five minutes . " <p> " You never identified yourself , " said Mom . <p> As twins , Terry and I had made it a policy to always let other people know which twin they were dealing with , unless we agreed to deceive . These days we did n't have to say anything to people who could see us . Our voices on the phone were the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have told Hugh . " He did n't ask . " <p> " Not fair , Tash . " <p> I shrugged . " He 'll know the difference when I get there . I wonder which is Terry 's favorite grave ? " The cemetery was n't big enough to get lost in , though it had graves from pioneer times on up to the present . " I 'll be back in a little while . " <p> She watched as I left the house . I could feel her gaze , but I did n't look back . <p> I was starting to feel hungry again . On the walk to the cemetery , I spoke to air . " You fed me yesterday . Can you teach me hove ? Is that okay for me to ask ? " <p> I heard the faint weave of whispers around me , and I stopped , breathed , slowed myself until I could listen . <p> " Ask any time , " the whispers said . " Open your mouth . " <p> I leaned against a maple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth . I breathed slowly and deeply , and tasted  --  <p> Crisp red fall apples , the coolness of the mountains where the leaves had already started to turn and ice formed on puddles , the browning edge of bread in the ovens of the bakery , fresh mint from the fields toward the central valley , Sunday dinners cooking in houses all over town , and the barest taste of fabric softener from the Laundromat by Safeway . <p> I asked the air to edit out the fabric softener , then breathed everything else down inside me until I felt full . <p> " Thanks , " I said . <p> The whispers tumbled over each other . I could n't make out the words , and not because I was n't listening . This time they were telling me something I was n't ready to hear ; but I got the sense that somehow as they fed me , I was feeding them , so it worked out for all of us . <p> Hugh was sitting at the feet of a stone angel . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp down almost immediately . " Shoulda known , " he said as I gathered my skirts and sat down beside him . " You agreed way too fast to see me . " <p> His red hair was shorter than I remembered it . He looked paler than usual , with smudges under his green eyes . He had always been short  --  no taller than Terry and I , and we were five foot three  --  but , hunching in his sage green sweater , he looked diminished . <p> " Well , you asked me to come , and I wanted to find out what 's going on , " I said . " You do n't look good . " <p> " You remember that time when Terry went down inside herself and I went after her ? " <p> It had happened when we were all fifteen , pretty soon after Terry and Hugh met . I nodded . <p> " Ever since then we 've had this connection . I thought I was lucky . I only had to think about her , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was doing . We almost did n't need the phone to talk . I grew up alone , and I always dreamed of finding somebody to connect with like that , and it was great ! Just absolutely great . I thought I was set for life . " <p> " So ? " I said . <p> " Lately , all I get is a lot of pain , and she wo n't even talk to me . Tasha. . . if this is how it 's going to be , I need to ask her to cut the cord . I ca n't take much more of this . " <p> I took his hand . " Come on , Hugh , " I said . " Come home with me . " <p> " Do n't you think I 've tried that ? If I get anywhere near her , she slips off sideways . I can never catch up to her , even though I know where she is . " <p> " Yes , " I said , " but you 're not me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and we got up . <p> I pulled Hugh to a stop on our front stoop and tasted the air . He cocked his head . " She 's home , " he said . <p> " Keep her here , " I whispered to air , " please . " A breeze patted my cheek . <p> We went inside . <p> Dad was sitting at the kitchen table , reading a section of the paper and drinking coffee . He had n't shaved yet , and he was in his bathrobe . He looked up at us and frowned as we walked through . " I forgot what it was like to have a full house , " he said in a grumpy voice . <p> " Dad , it 's almost one , " I said . " Do n't tell me I woke you up . I 've been out of the house most of the morning . " <p> He glared , then returned to his paper . <p> Hugh followed me through the laundry room , then hesitated outside Terry 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry was still inside . Hugh 's face scrinched up , then relaxed . " She tried to bolt , " he whispered . <p> I touched the doorknob . The door opened from the other side . Terry , wide-eyed and pale , stood and stared at us . " What are you doing to me ? " she asked me . <p> " What are you running away from ? " I asked in return . I grabbed Hugh 's hand and dragged him past Terry into her room , which was the mirror image of mine as far as furniture went . She had painted her walls and ceiling black , though , and stuck phosphorescent stars all over them . A realistic rubber bat hung from a string . The bed was covered with a navy-blue spread , and the rag rug on the floor was midnight blue . Hugh and I stood beside each other , glancing around . The decor was new since the last time either of us had been in her room , I guessed . I remembered the walls being papered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stacks of old books stood by her bed , book marks sticking out like white tongues from between their pages . <p> " Research , " she said . <p> " On what ? " I said , bunching my shoulders . The air here was tainted by something I did n't recognize and did n't much Nike . <p> " On some topics Gran wo n't go into , " said Terry . <p> " Ewww . Hugh . . . I 'll be just the other side of the closet if you need me . " I opened Terry 's closet door . <p> " Do n't go , " he said . <p> " But  --  " <p> " This should only take a minute . Terry , either stick with me or cut me loose . " <p> She went even paler . She looked like soap , with two sapphires inset for eyes . " Hugh , " she said . <p> " I thought maybe this separation was temporary , that you 'd get back to me when you were finished with whatever you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved his hands into his jean pockets . " But this looks permanent , and it hurts too much . I think you hurt too much . Either let me help you , or let me go . " <p> " All right , " she said . Her eyes were so wide white was visible all the way around the irises . Her mouth pinched shut . She held up her right hand , using her index and middle fingers like scissors , and cut the air between her and Hugh . <p> Both of them gasped . Hugh clapped his hands to his chest , breathing in jagged rasps . Terry did n't seem to be breathing at all . <p> " Air , " I said . I held out my hands to my sister and my friend , felt the air flowing like water across my palms . One stream went to each of them . I knew it carried strength and support and what healing air and I could offer . Gradually Hugh and Terry started breathing normally . Color touched their cheeks . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . " <p> " You asked for it , " Terry said . <p> " Yes . I 'm starting to feel better now . What 's wrong with you , Tere ? " <p> " What do you care ? " <p> " I love you , " he said . <p> She stared at him , silent , for a long moment . A tear spilled down her cheek and vanished . " If you love me why did you want to cut me off ? " <p> " Because you 're killing me . What are you doing to yourself ? " <p> She sniffled and touched a finger to the inner comer of her eye . <p> " You want me to leave ? " I asked . " I hope you do n't . I want to know what 's going on , too . " <p> " I do n't ever want you to leave , " Terry said , with considerable ferocity . <p> " What ? " I faltered . <p> " How could you leave , anyway ? How could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I would n't leave you , " she said . <p> " This is about me ? " <p> She stared at me , her lips thinning , then looked away . She held up scissor fingers and made a few half-hearted snips in the air . <p> " What ? " I said . " What , what ? " <p> " I 'm the strong one . I know what I 'm doing . How come you 're the one who got away ? " <p> " It surprised me too , " I said . " But it was n't that hard , once I got on the other side of it . You could do it . So what is this ? Have you spent the months since I left miserating and hurting Hugh and not even telling me ! " <p> " Not exactly , " she said . <p> I sat on her bed and picked up one of the books on the floor . <p> " Hey ! " she said . <p> I looked at the spine . The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and threw it across the room . " No wonder it smells bad in here ! " I picked up another book . It was about voodoo . I dropped it . <p> " Some of it works , " said Terry . <p> " Eww , Terry ! " <p> " Do n't be such a prude , " said Terry . <p> Hugh picked up the book I had set down , glanced at the spine , opened it , and flipped through a few pages . " Huh , " he said , " pictures . " He showed me a picture of a voodoo doll . <p> " Air , " I whispered , starting to feel afraid . The cool strength of air flowed into me , and I felt better . " What did you do ? " I asked my sister . <p> " Well , you came home , did n't you ? " <p> I breathed so deeply that my feet left the ground . The air was filtering out the taint in the room for me . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time to tell her I still had an apartment in Spores . <p> " You jab me with any pins and I will turn it back on you , " I said . <p> " I did n't . I would n't . Not ever . " <p> " Even after I choked you ? " <p> " Thinking is n't doing , " she said . <p> " Are you messing with Mom and Dad ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Good . Do n't . " <p> " Somebody ought to , " she said . <p> " No . " <p> " Face it , Tash , they 're screwing up somehow . You know how , do n't you ? That 's what happened last night . You figured it out . " <p> I spread my fingers , felt wind weaving between them . " Do n't even think about it , " I said . " I 'm living my discipline now . " I still did n't know what air would want to do with me when I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , I got the impression it would respect some of my wishes . <p> I glanced at Hugh . He set the voodoo book down . He looked much less haunted than he had at the feet of the stone angel in the cemetery . " It 's starting to make sense , " he said . " Terry . Let me know when you 're done with this . " He tapped the book . He walked to the door and let himself out . <p> " Everybody 's a prude , " said Terry . She twisted her fingers in a power gesture , and muttered some words in a language Natalya had taught us . " So tell me , " she said . " What is going on with More and Dad ? " <p> Air caught the powerflow from her hands and her mouth , and filtered it elsewhere before I breathed it in . " Do n't push me , " I said . The door blew open , and I slipped out of her room , still floating on air . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mom said . " Tash is studying to be a magician , Austin . " <p> Dad looked a little more agreeable . He had taken his shower , shaved , and gotten dressed , and he and More were sharing the paper and a late lunch . <p> I reached into my pocket for the napkin scraps . " Watch this , " I said , and sprinkled the handful of scraps in the air . They darted around , then formed the snowflake pattern again and hung there , flickering . I grinned . I snapped my fingers and held out my hand , and the shreds gathered on my palm . <p> Dad stared , then blinked . " Do you know any other tricks , Tasha ? " he said , his voice strained . <p> " I have n't worked anything else out yet . I 'm still studying principles . If I figure out some other tricks , I 'll show them to you . " <p> " I 'd like to see that one again . " <p> " Okay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked up and saw my twin standing in the door to the laundry room . Oh , well . In for a penny , in for a pound . This time I made a couple of magic passes over the paper shreds , then dropped them . They spread into a different snowflake . I wondered if that was a mistake . I let them hover a little longer , then snapped at them and they jumped into my hand . <p> " How , " said Dad , " did you do that ? " <p> " Ca n't tell you . " <p> " Did you know I had a magic act when I was a teenager ? I actually played in clubs . " <p> I had known , when I was little : I remembered Dad doing card tricks for me and Terry , and teaching us the magician 's creed . But I had forgotten . " Maybe you can show me some of your stuff , " I said . Air brushed the back of my neck , trying to blow down the hackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick to compare to that one , " he said . " As one magician to another , can you tell me how it 's done ? " <p> I closed my hand around the paper scraps . " I 'll make you a deal . A secret for a secret . " <p> " All right , " said Dad . <p> I drew in a deep breath , trying to taste my options . Everything had gotten so mixed up , with Terry practicing the arts that involved blood and death and controlling other people for her own wishes , and all the other cracks in the family picture . I did n't want to hurt Mom . Maybe it was time , though , to get things out in the open . That might hurt less than secrets . <p> Air had warmth riding it , a different strength from coolness . It entered me and touched me with relaxation . Whatever happened , I knew air would support me . " What 's her name ? " I said . <p> " Whose name ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the silence , I could hear air whispers . Tiny warm breezes like fingers brushed up and down my arms . <p> I glanced toward Terry . She had her hand at her throat . <p> " Linda , " said Dad . " How did you know ? " <p> " Perfume . Not Mom 's . " I looked at Mom . I remembered kneeling next to her in church that morning . She had been praying ; the air had told me about it , how the energy around her changed . It was part of the calmness that was n't sleep . <p> Right now she looked still . Her hands clasped each other on the table in front of her . " Why , Austin ? " she said . Her voice was steady . <p> " That 's going to take some time , Becka . " He ran his hands through his hair , then scrubbed his face . " No excuses , though . I did it . Tash , how did you do that paper trick ? " <p> I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer , " said Dad . <p> " I 'm not a magician , Mom Dad . I 'm a witch . Secret for a secret . " <p> " Tasha , " said More , and this time her voice was full of the pain it had n't held when she had braced Dad . <p> I smiled , leaning against air , and opened my hands . Paper scraps startled up , tore into tinier bits , streamed in a spiral up and down , circled me as the warm-edged wind tangled my hair . The tiny white paper bits hovered above the table , forming a rayed sun , spun for a moment in the air , then drifted gently down onto the table . " I 've been wanting to tell you for a while . " <p> " Tasha , " said More again , only this time her voice was half breath . <p> " Right now I 'm studying air . I love air . " <p> Dad collected some paper scraps in his hand . " Lift them , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air moved across his hand , collecting the paper , dancing it up and across the room . It snowed down on my hair , catching in the dark tangles like white feathers . <p> " Terry , did you know this ? " Mom asked . <p> " That Tasha is a witch ? I knew . " <p> " Is it  --  real ? " Mom said . <p> " Yes , " said Terry . " She 's a witch . And I 'm a witch . " <p> " Oh , " said Mom . She put her hands on her cheeks . " I feel so odd . " <p> I went to her and laid my hands on her shoulders . " Breathe , " I said , and asked the air to nourish and sustain her . She took some deep breaths . <p> Presently she said , " I feel better . I do n't know why . How can you be witches ? Your father and I never  --  " She looked around the kitchen as if searching for a cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no ! " I said . " No . It 's not like that at all . It 's more  --  " I thought of offering flower dust to air . " A  --  an affinity for natural forces . " <p> " Being able to talk to nature , " Terry said , " and having it answer . " <p> " That does n't sound so bad , " said More . " Maybe I 'm a witch too , when I garden . " <p> " Yes , More , " I said , squeezing her shoulders a little . I released her and sat at the table . <p> " How did this happen ? " Dad asked . " Were you born like this ? " His voice carried an undertone of hope . <p> " No , " said Terry . " Actually , this guy cast a spell on us when we were twelve , and it activated our  --  our witchliness . " <p> " Could you cast a spell like that ? All my life I 've dreamed  --  " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terry said . <p> " Oh , " said Mom , her eyes looking up and to the right , " no discipline . Oh . Danny is your spirit guide . Oh . Oh , my . He 's going to teach you to fly ? What does that make him ? " <p> " Someone more sophisticated , " Terry said . <p> " Could he cast that spell ? " Dad asked . <p> " Nope , he does n't work that way , " said Terry . <p> " What 's a heat signature ? " More demanded . <p> " Danny does n't  --  " I began . " He sees a little differently from us . " <p> " Oh , dear , " said Mom . She sank back . " Oh , this rips the world open , twins . I feel like a baby . I do n't know what 's been going on here these last five years . " <p> " A lot of stuff you do n't know about that does n't really change much , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't worship the Devil , we do n't turn people into toads . At least  --  " I frowned at Terry , and she giggled . I remembered , suddenly , the first time I had met Hugh  --  before Terry did . He insulted one of my best friends , and I turned him into a dog . That was back when I was young and confident , secure in my disciplines . I tried to remember the spell I had used . Back then it was right there when I needed it , uncomplicated : just words , very strong words , and no stage fright or hesitation on my part . When had I lost that confidence , and why ? <p> Air whispered to me . I breathed and listened . " Never be afraid again , " it said . <p> " What if I ca n't ask for what I need ? " I murmured . <p> " We can hear inside your head , " said the whispers , stroking my ears and neck . <p> " What was that ? " Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " The air , " she said . " The air . " <p> " That 's the element she picked to study , " said Terry . " Personally I 'd prefer something with a little more force , like water or fire . " <p> " You talk to the air , and it talks back ? " asked Mom . <p> " Yes . " I grinned . " Oh , yes . At first I thought like Terry . What fun is air ? But it 's amazing , Mom ! The music this morning was so powerful . There 's so much I do n't know yet ! Air is the element that talks . And . . . " I pushed my chair back and stood up . " And . . . " Air slipped under my feet , held me around waist and shoulders , lifted me a foot above the floor . I laughed , holding out my arms . My hair rose around my head , and my skirt flared . " Danny 's going to teach me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I lowered my arms and sank to the floor . <p> " That worked just fine , " said Terry . <p> " That worked . . . . " Mom said . She put her hand over her breastbone . " Oh , Tash , " she whispered . <p> Dad was just staring . At last he blinked . I felt strange . The happiness , the antigravity seeped away . I had never figured out what to expect once I told them I was a witch . I had n't expected them to be scared . <p> " Terry , you can do that too ? " Mom asked . <p> " Not that , but other things . " <p> " Oh . Oh , twins , " said More . " I need time to think . " <p> " So do I , " Dad said . <p> " We 'll go away for a while , " said Terry . <p> " I want to call Gran , " I said . Natalya would help me . Had telling our parents been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , no . Another piece of the puzzle . Gran . That sweet little old lady is a master witch . Look , Tasha . Here 's my college education coming in to play . It helped me master analysis of facts . Gran 's been seeing a lot of you two for the past five years . Gran 's supposed to help you study air . Oh , my . " <p> " Looks like college does help , " I said . " Keep taking deep breaths , Mom . The air is your friend . " I headed for the living room extension and called Natalya . " I need you . " <p> " All right , " she said . <p> " And Gran , Terry  --  " <p> Air tugged a lock of my hair . I turned and saw Terry standing in the doorway to the living room . <p> " Yes ? " said Gran . " Terry what ? " <p> " Can Terry and I come over and talk to you ? " <p> She sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clock . Nearly four-thirty in the afternoon . " I have to ask her , but I know I want to talk to you , anyway . I 'll be right over . " <p> I said good-bye and hung up . " Will you go to Gran 's with me ? " <p> " You 're going to tell her about my studies if I do n't , are n't you ? " <p> " I will anyway . Your choice . " <p> " What do you think ? She 's going to cast at me and switch me around inside until I 'm a marshmallow ? " <p> " That 's more your style . " <p> " I could do that to you first , so you ca n't tell her anything . " <p> " Do n't , " I said . <p> " Stop me if you can . " <p> She chanted at me , invoking twisters , adding gestures . The words were in the language of magic . I listened . The spell she laid out would soften me until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . I would always be good and sweet and kind , and I would do every dirty dish I saw . She said the endword , added the finishing gesture , and cast the whole tapestry of command at me . <p> Air swallowed the spell . A second later I felt something small and square materialize in my pocket . <p> " You would hate it if that had worked , " I said . <p> She looked pale . It was a tough , effective spell , and she had put effort into it , only to see it disappear into nowhere . Or my pocket . She did n't know that , though . <p> " In fact , right now I could drop it on you . You know how ugly that would be ? I would hate you like that . " <p> " I just thought it would be fun to try for a while . I could always switch you back later . " <p> " How do you know ? " <p> She blew on her fingernails , buffed them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " I said . " Okay , you 're good . I do n't trust you to put me back together right , though . " <p> Air tweaked a lock of my hair again . I glanced toward the kitchen . I wondered how long Mom had been standing there . " Mom ? " I said . <p> She gave me a smile with a wobble in it . I went and hugged her , holding her until the stiffness melted and she embraced me in response . " I just keep breathing , " she whispered . <p> " Good , " I whispered back . " I love you . " I wished I could protect her from everything but 1 knew I could n't . <p> " Your granny witch  --  she 's a good person ? " Mom asked . <p> " The best , " I said . We had had Natalya over to supper a few times . She and Mom had discussed gardening and the language of flowers . <p> She let me go and stepped back . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know anybody anymore  --  not you , not Terry , not your father . Have I been walking around blind for so long ? How ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I 'm sorry . I thought it was time to stop keeping secrets now . " <p> " Yes , " she said . She rubbed her eyes . " A little space will help , I think . I need to sit and think about all this . " <p> " Come on , Gran 's expecting us , " said Terry from behind me . " Comb your hair , Tash . It 's a mess . " <p> I ducked into the front bathroom and studied myself . My hair was in tangles , snowed with napkin scraps . I pulled a comb through it . With air 's help , there were n't any snarls , and my hair curled . I frowned . That should n't be happening . It was naturally flat , and I had n't done any work with a blow dryer or curling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known than ever . The blue in my eyes had darkened . I smiled at me and said , " Air . " <p> My curls twitched . <p> I put down the comb and joined Terry . <p> " My car this time , " she said . <p> " How did you buy this car , anyway ? " I asked when we were on our way . Terry had a nice white Fiat . " Your college money ? " <p> " Lottery tickets , " said Terry . She waggled her eyebrows at me . <p> " Jeeze ! What a great idea ! " <p> " You have to be subtle . I favor the small wins myself , because you do n't need ID to pick up the money . " <p> " I could make my rent . " <p> " Rent ? " she asked , staring at me with narrowed eyes . <p> I smiled at her . Air , I thought , if there 's a doll of me anywhere in her room , please find it and steal it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantle it . <p> Yes , whispered air . <p> Thanks . <p> Air stroked my cheek . I closed my eyes . How can I ever repay you ? I thought I was working my way out of debt , but I just keep asking for more things . <p> Do n't worry , whispered air . Breathe . <p> I breathed , slow and deep . It was weird . I tasted clean cool air coming in , and I tasted something else going out of me , warm and sweet . <p> Terry poked me . " Rent ? " she said again . <p> " Rent , " I said . " What about it ? " <p> " What do you mean , rent ? " <p> " On my apartment . " <p> " It 's still your apartment ? " <p> " Mmm , " I said . <p> " Damn ! " <p> " If the dark arts worked perfectly , what would be the point ? If you could pull my strings and make me do whatever you wanted me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could do it to anybody you liked or hated . " <p> " The fun part is doing it to you , " she said . <p> " Forget it . " <p> " Tash , " she said , despair in her voice , " I always knew we 'd split up sometime . I just think now is too soon . " <p> " You 've been getting too bossy and superior . You 're too hard to live with . Besides , there 's Danny  --  " <p> " What kind of future could a relationship like that have ? " <p> " I 'd like to find out , " I said . <p> " Ih ! You think I 'm sick ! " <p> " We 've been driving around this block for five minutes , " I said . " Will you get us to Gran 's already ? " <p> " Maybe not , " she said . <p> I looked at her . The car got very quiet . It turned down Main . Terry jerked the steering wheel right and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're getting mean , " Terry told me between clenched teeth . She pressed the gas pedal . The engine roared , to no avail . <p> " Me ? I did n't do anything . " I opened the door and slid out of the car . When I was safely on the sidewalk and had closed the door again , the car dropped to the asphalt . Terry still had her foot on the gas , and the car shot down the street . <p> I sucked air in between my teeth . If she was hurt  --  <p> She got the car turned around and parked . She was steaming when she climbed out . <p> Natalya stood by her gate , watching both of us . <p> Terry threw a rash of pimples at me . <p> " You 're wasting your energy , " I said , and went to kiss Natalya , who was smiling . <p> " Astonishing , Tasha , " she said after we had greeted each other . " I 've never before seen so much progress so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , all I do is breathe , and I 'd be doing that anyway , would n't I ? Air does it . " <p> " It takes two . You align , air aligns . It 's beautiful to see . " <p> " It 's more fun than I ever imagined . Gran , my totem turned out to be my boyfriend ! " <p> " How could that be ? " <p> " Uh  --  " Would she think it was sick , the way Terry did ? Air had picked him for me ; it must be right . " He 's a vampire . " <p> She frowned . " I was n't sure such things existed . I do n't understand how this can aid you . . . I find this confusing , but I would like an introduction if the opportunity arises . " <p> " Of course . " I glanced at Terry , who had joined me . " Gran , my sister is practicing dark arts . " <p> " I know , " said Natalya . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than someone else , Tasha . You have defenses . " <p> I fished the spell from my pocket and handed it to Natalya . She exclaimed and dropped it . " What is that ? " she cried , alarmed . <p> " Terry 's plan for making me docile , " I said . It was a small pink and powder-blue cube , and it lay on the ground , innocent as any pebble . <p> " How did you do that ? " Terry asked , studying her handiwork transformed . <p> " Toxic , " said Natalya , fanning the air in front of her face . " Terry , you 're getting sloppy . " <p> " I knew it would n't work . " <p> " You did not ! " I said . <p> Terry shrugged . <p> Natalya said , " Of course it would have worked . It 's overkill , though , and dangerous . Terry , you know whatever you put out will return to you three times . " <p> Terry shrugged . I held out my hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in my pocket . <p> " What are you going to do with it ? " Terry asked me . <p> " I do n't know yet . Maybe flush it down the toilet . " Air tugged at my bangs , and I looked toward Natalya 's house . Sitting on the porch swing was the Leather Man . This time I decided not to say anything to Natalya . <p> Who is that ? I asked air . The Leather Man 's green eyes stared into mine . <p> Ours , whispered air . You and he will be together . <p> " What ? " I said , trembling . He looked so much like the nightmares of my childhood , the man who would come in the night to steal me away and do I knew not what to me , the man I had heard stories about on dark nights at sleepover parties . How could this be ? How could air sanction my being with Danny , and tell me that this man was to be my  --  I did n't even know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched my hand , then followed my gaze . The Leather Man 's stare staved on me . He faded like a shadow at the sun 's touch . <p> " It just stopped being fun , " I said in a wobbly voice . <p> " What happened ? " Terry asked . <p> " Did you see him ? " <p> " The ghost ? Sure . I 've been seeing him for a couple years . " <p> " He 's going to be my  --  I do n't know . Air says we 'll be together . That 's what air asks of me . " <p> " Tasha , " said Natalya . " Try to trust . " <p> " But  --  " Air had saved me . I had given myself to air ; air was taking care of me ; and now air was giving me to someone else . For a moment I could n't even breathe . Fear choked me . Desperation closed my throat . <p> Air pushed its way inside me . Soon I was breathing deeply without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I closed my eyes and felt a tear track down my cheek . All right , I told air . I 'm sorry . Whatever you say . I breathed out my resistance , letting it go . <p> Breathe and be you , air said . <p> Be me ? Me is scared . <p> That 's all right . <p> " Okay , " I said aloud . " I 'll try to trust . " I touched the lump in my pocket . If I could n't stand what happened to me , I could always break Terry 's spell over my head . Whoever I turned into would acquiesce to anything . <p> " Let 's have tea , " said Natalya . <p> Natalya poured . She was using the Japanese service this time , glazed white porcelain with black characters on the pot , and small handleless white cups . The tea this time was dark and smoky-tasting . <p> I thought about all the questions I had for Natalya . What could I learn from Danny when he was already confused about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leather Man ? Where was this discipline leading me ? What about Terry , anyway ? Maybe Natalya would just tell me to trust . Maybe she could tell me other things . " There 's so much I do n't understand . Where do I end up , Gran ? Who do I turn into ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said Natalya . " Truth to tell , I do n't know anybody who 's activated a relationship with an element quite the way you have , so I ca n't predict your future . " <p> I breathed in cool calm and released more fear . The whispers were clear to me . Whatever happens , we will keep you safe , they said . <p> What 's your definition of safe ? <p> Body , mind , and spirit nourished and growing . <p> I took another breath and tasted baking bread on it . I glanced around the kitchen , frowning . The oven was off . <p> Baking bread smelled like the safest thing I knew , with the anticipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oven . <p> I breathed again , and the taste was stronger , feeding me . One more breathful and I felt calm , ready to accept whatever happened . <p> " You keep zoning out , " Terry said . <p> " I 'm still here . I 'm just talking to air . " <p> " It 's really annoying . " <p> " Get used to it , Twin . The rest of my life I 'll be doing it . " <p> " You sure have switched over from yesterday . " <p> " A lot has changed . " <p> Terry looked at Natalya . In a voice edged with sadness , she said , " Gran . Dad was  --  Tash comes home , she looks at him , she figures it out . Dad was seeing some other woman yesterday . We do n't even know what this means . Tash told Mom about that and the witching and then we left . It feels like everything could fall apart . " <p> Natalya reached across the table and gripped Terry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " The pieces will fall into new patterns , " Natalya said at last . " Everything changes . Trying to lock something into one pattern when it 's ready to change is a mistake . In the face of change , I will be here . You 're always welcome . " <p> " Are you saying  --  " Terry swiped at a tear . " No . It 's not fair . What 's magic for , anyway ? If I plan right , I can fix it ! " <p> " Terry , " said Natalya . <p> " Tasha runs away , Hugh tells me to cut our bond  --  that hurt , Gran !  --  More and Dad  --  I can channel enough power . I know I can . " <p> I wanted to jump up and tell her I 'd block everything she wanted to do . It gave me the creeps . I breathed instead , and waited . <p> " How would you start ? " Natalya said . There was no condemnation in her voice . <p> Terry gripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not to her room , to the town . She could be herself and do anything she wanted . She 'd just stay here . Hugh  --  I do n't know what to do about Hugh . He said he 'd come back if I gave up these other arts , but how can I handle this without these other arts ? If I put a come-hither on him , though , he would n't be the same . I have n't figured out Hugh yet . If I could just wipe our Mom and Dad 's memories of yesterday  --  maybe the whole weekend would be better . How can I do that , Gran ? " <p> " I ca n't help you with that , my dear . " <p> " Ca n't or wo n't ? " <p> Natalya smiled . " For me to do it , I would have to violate my covenant with the powers that work with me , and if I break my covenant , I ca n't expect the powers to respond to me the way I want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She had told us about her covenant before , in passing . She had never really explained it . She said a time would come when she 'd need to tell us about it , but so far the time had n't arrived . <p> " Then I 'll just have to work it out with my books . " Terry got up . <p> Natalya rose too . " Terry . I will always love you . You are choosing toward aligning yourself with powers I wo n't deal with . That might make it hard for you to visit me , because my house is warded against those powers . I said you are always welcome here , and you are , if you come without those powers . The choice is yours . Just now I want to say farewell . " She put her arms around Terry . <p> Terry leaned forward and hugged her back , then pushed her away . " No . You 're supposed to tell me it 's wrong and I should n't do it . " <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Terry , " that 's not fair either . Dad never told us what to do , Mom never told us what to do , and now you wo n't tell us what to do . Most kids have grown-ups who tell them what to do , Gran . You used to tell us . It used to drive me nuts ! You used to be so bossy , making us memorize that stuff , and team those languages , and not try anything until you told us we were ready  --  " <p> " You 're old enough now to decide what you want to learn and what you do n't want . " <p> " No , " said Terry again . " I do n't want to be that old . " Her eyes were wild . " And I do n't want Tasha to be that old , either . This air stuff . This apartment stuff . She 's acting way too much like a grown-up . I  --  " She closed her hands , then opened them and worked her fingers , weaving something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost recognizable , a thread of water magic , a ripple of time , a pinch of green ; but the other ingredients came from disciplines we had never learned from Natalya . <p> Air lifted my hair , blowing it back , stroking cool along my cheeks . Wind touched me everywhere . <p> When Terry made her cut-off gesture and set her spell loose , it rose like green-gray smoke , hovered over us all for a moment , then drifted down toward her and me . The arm of the spell that reached for me blew away before it could touch me . Terry stood , hunched , watching the other arm . A finger reached for her face . She backed away . " No , " she said . " If it does n't work for both of us , I do n't want it . " It pursued her . She rounded the table and grabbed my arm . " Tash . Okay . I give up . Stop it , will you ? " <p> I lifted a hand , not sure what air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the marshmallow one and compressed it , then handed it to me ; I held a small golden disc shot with streaks of black and red in my hand . I put it in my pocket with the other spell . <p> " What was this one supposed to do ? " I asked . <p> " Turn us into little kids . " <p> " You are nuts , " I said . Then I thought about it . When we were little kids , we were tight with each other . We went everywhere together , fearless , warriors . We explored , we crossed lines , we pushed boundaries . No magic . Bottomless curiosity . No supervision . <p> Something in me longed for that . <p> I took a deep breath . No . I was here now , my feet on the ground , air inside me , in the middle of the journey where all my choices had led me . It was time to take the next step . <p> " Did that spell come out of a book ? " Natalya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just made it up . " <p> Natalya went to the stationery drawer and got out some paper and a pen . " Please write it down before you lose it . It was beautiful , Terry . The combination of elements  --  inspired " <p> " But Gran  --  " Terry looked at Natalya , then shook her head and sat down , accepting pen and paper . She frowned at her hand , tried to frame the gestures she had used , then write them down . " Gran , " she said , after working at it . " I forget . " <p> " Invoke your discipline , " said Natalya . <p> Terry glared at her a moment with narrowed eyes , then went back to work . <p> " Did n't that use powers you would n't use ? " I asked Natalya . <p> Natalya got down some almond biscotti and put them on a plate , set the plate on the table . " Perhaps , " she said . " Many people do . Still , it 's something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frowned at her hand some more . I was still full of aerial bread . <p> " So , what are we going to do about Mom and Dad ? " Terry said in a low voice when we had finished our tea . <p> Natalya looked into her teacup . " Tell them you 're upset , ask them how they feel , whether there are new plans . That 's my advice . " <p> " And your advice is to leave Tasha alone , right ? " <p> " The choice is yours . " <p> " And Hugh ? " <p> " What did he say ? " <p> " He said he loved me , and I should call him when I give up the dark arts . " <p> " Well , that sounds clear to me . Anything else ? " <p> " No , " said Terry . She looked at the page she had written , crossed something out , added something in , then put down the pen . <p> " All right . Go home . It 's suppertime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out . " Natalya patted Terry 's shoulder . " The choice is always yours , " she said , " and the consequences of your choices  --  those are yours too . I love you no matter what . Remember that if you continue to follow the dark paths , it will be harder for us to see each other . " <p> " Okay , " said Terry . She folded up the guidelines to her spell and shoved them into her pocket . <p> " Also remember that you 're inspired . You have a gift . Whichever direction you choose , you 're going to be very good , as long as you maintain discipline . " <p> " Okay . Thanks , " said Terry gruffly . <p> " What about me ? " I asked . <p> " You 'll be fine . I do n't know that t here 's anything more for me to teach you . " <p> On the drive home , Terry said , " Maybe just a little stardust . " <p> I did n't say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , they look at each other , they 're in love ; whatever 's past is past . That would n't hurt anybody , would it ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " It would n't tell us why . " <p> " I mean , it 's not the end of the world . Other guys cheat . Maybe More did something like that too . Maybe they 're just bored . Maybe they 'll get a divorce . Almost everybody we know has divorced parents . Why should ours be different ? " <p> " You 're OBAH , " I said , which was shorthand for Obsessing Before Anything Happens . <p> " Yeah , sure , okay , " she said , and we spent the rest of the drive in silence . <p> Terry parked her car behind Mom 's maroon Ghia and we walked into the house , wondering . I breathed deep , searching the air for hints . Lemon chicken , cooking in the oven , the ammonia after taste of loud voices , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a faint caraway-seed taste of hope . I took Terry 's hand and walked into the kitchen . <p> Our parents were sitting at the table playing rummy . " So , " said Dad , " did you get everything squared away ? " <p> " Did you ? " Terry , asked . <p> " No , " said Mom . She picked up the card face up on the discard pile and dropped something else . <p> " Dad , " Terry said . " Dad , how could you ? " <p> He hunched his shoulders , then sighed and dropped his cards . " I 've been over this with your mother , " he said . " It feels complicated to me , but maybe it 's not . I come home from work and everything is kind of locked up somehow . You 're in your room doing stuff that worries me more now than it did before . Tasha is gone . Becka is tired . I go to work and there 's no place for me to go  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever make maitre d ' . Your mother and I are barely managing the house payments . They reassess the house higher every year and jack the property tax . We might have to sell , and then what ? I lie in bed at night thinking about this after your mother is asleep , and I wake every morning with a sour taste in my mouth . <p> " So I 'm at work . Linda 's a cocktail waitress at the restaurant . She 's young and beautiful and she gives me these looks . She says these inviting things . And I think . . . I think , anything for a little change or a little hope . So , finally , yesterday , I said yes . " <p> He rubbed his hand across his mouth . " The irony of it is that what I was looking for was a little magic . " <p> I felt as if something had struck my heart . If I had come home one day earlier . . . if I had talked to the parents about witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Terry had . . . if Mom had told Dad I was coming home in the middle day . . . if Terry had been out in the living room talking to Dad instead of back in her room reading . . . <p> "  --  and the truth of it is that I chose to take Linda up on an invitation , " he said . " I did n't think I would get caught . I did n't think it would hurt anybody . I did n't sleep very well last night , though . It 's better that it came out . The next move is your mother 's . " <p> " Well , you can stay for dinner , " said Mom . " But I 'm not sleeping with you . " <p> " So I 'm bunking on the living room couch . That 's as squared as we 've gotten it , " Dad said . <p> " I want counseling , too , " Mom said . " Both of us . " <p> " I do n't see how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford not to . " <p> Dad sighed . " All right . So , twins , what 's next for you ? " <p> Terry shrugged . " Study and discipline , " she said . <p> " Discipline and study , " I said . <p> " Tash , show me that napkin trick again , " Dad said , " please . " <p> I was mad at him  --  not an explosive anger that ran through me like fire , I knew air would smother an anger like that , but a quiet anger , low and steady , because he had put so much of what I loved at risk . I looked at him for a long moment , then sat down at the table , took a napkin , and shredded it . If it helped him and Mom accept what they now knew about me and Terry , it was a good thing to do . <p> After dinner , Terry and I stood in our back yard . The evening had cooled , and I had changed into my sneak clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had left the back lights off , keeping the yard dark to give ourselves as much of an advantage as we could . <p> Tonight we had agreed to practice one of our basics , Rule Three : Gather as much information as possible . " Since you left , I 've been working on new skills , " Terry said . " One is nightwalking invisibly . Watch this . " She did three quick gestures , said one powerful word , and disappeared . " Neat , huh ? " <p> " Terrif . " <p> " What 's the point if you ca n't actually use it ? " said her voice from a head-high spot in the air . " I 've been casing the whole neighborhood . Stand still . I 'm going to turn you invisible , too . " <p> " Uh  --  " I said , looking down at my hands . They faded away . For the first time , air had let Terry land a spell on me . <p> " The tricky part is not bumping into anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you usually would . When you ca n't see them , they get closer to a lot of stuff than you would have thought . " Her hand crept into mine . " Come on . " <p> Our invisible feet rustled on the grass . I felt very strange . <p> Terry stopped suddenly . " Wait a sec . Can you fly us ? I have n't been able to get any aerial views of the neighborhood so far . " <p> I ca n't fly yet , " I said . " Not really . " <p> " I 've seen you lift off the ground twice . " <p> " Yes , but  --  " Air , could you carry us ? <p> Terry 's hand clamped on mine . We rose , the neighborhood dropping away from our feet , until we could see over our fence and most of the others on the block , into back yards . We looked down on roofs , on the crowns of trees , in through back windows . Barbecues and patio furniture sat abandoned . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kinetic energy of children . Cats wandered fences , dogs barked , TV light flickered , people moved past windows . <p> I took some deep breaths , settling my surprise . " Now what ? " <p> " Uh , " said Terry . She sounded panicky . Not something I ever expected from my sister . She felt shaky , and her breathing was ragged . Maybe she was afraid of heights ? Good grief ! <p> Down , please , I thought , and air let us down gently on our back lawn . <p> Terry let out a whew . <p> A silvery mist seeped into the yard . <p> " Weird weather , " said Terry , her voice still a little wobbly . <p> The mist agitated , as if stirred . I let go of Terry 's hand and walked toward the mist and it collected itself around me . It coalesced and turned into Danny , his arms embracing me . " Your heat signature is here , but where 's the rest of you ? " <p> " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traded shifts with Chet . I thought being a totem might be more important . " He laid his hand on my cheek . " Tash , you smell strange . " <p> I asked air to lift Terry 's invisibility spell from me . It was odd . In the faint light of the city reflected from the clouds above , I saw my hair , my nose , and the upper edges of my checks appear , all the things I usually saw with peripheral vision but ignored . <p> Danny touched my lips with gentle fingers , then bent and kissed me . I opened my mouth against his , breathing him in , sage and moonlight , warmth and no-longer-human flesh ; I even tasted the strange viral undertone of his vampirism ; bloodwarm and ironsweet , and the special chemical in his saliva that stopped blood from clotting while he fed . I noticed again that his edges were n't like live peoples ' ; air mixed more easily with him . I discovered that there were a thousand trace smells to him , faint notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? His fingers tangled in my hair , pressed warmth against my skull . <p> " What , what ? " he whispered presently , releasing me . " You taste like grass and bread and candle wax , dark tea and chicken and cookies , things I have n't tasted in so long . " <p> " That 's a catalog of some of the things I 've done today . And you taste like  --  I ca n't figure it out . " <p> " But I mean , it 's different . It 's not on your skin . It 's inside you . " His lips brushed mine again , his tongue flicking to taste me . " Oh ! " he said . " Now I 'm in there too . " <p> Trembling started in my shoulders and spread . I leaned against Danny , shudders rippling through me . He held me . <p> " Air , " I whispered . <p> In our service , all you need to do is breathe and be , whispered air . Breathe and become . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encompassed . <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> It is not important for you to understand . <p> I took three deep breaths . They contained a warmth and tenderness I had never tasted before . I breathed out fear . Tasting it on its way out of me , I sensed sterile dust . I let it go . <p> " What is it ? " Danny whispered . <p> " I do n't think I get it yet , " I said . " It 's scary . " Fear was dust that choked me . I breathed again , and tasted night dewing the grass , and the body heat and complex scent-web of Danny , and Terry , who was somewhere near . I let the dust go . " Well , okay . I go beyond my fear . I gave myself to air . Air says all it asks of me is that I become everything . " <p> He stroked my hair back from my face . " Ah , " he said . " This is starting to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't need to teach you how to fly . You can get up and down by yourself already . It 's about tasting . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Everyone I 've ever tasted is inside me . " <p> I pressed my cheek against his chest . " Everything I breathe becomes part of me . " <p> " Yes , " he whispered . " You know what that means ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " You can go out and pick the things you 're going to breathe . Maybe you 'll get around to everything eventually , but you might as well start with the things you enjoy . " <p> " Is that what you do ? " <p> " When I can . " He reached for my hand , lifted my wrist to his lips . I breathed in night and woodsmoke , flooding my blood with flavored air . As we shared blood , I drew in breath , tasting leaves turning , suppers cooking , plants sliding into sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wrist . " Chili , " he said . <p> " Tempers . It 's been some kind of day . " <p> He shook his head , smiling . " Will you be my totem ? " <p> Breath caught in my throat , then flowed . " Yes , " I said . <p> He laughed and let me go , then reached out and snagged something standing near us . " You want to go in ? " he asked me . " I think we should go around to the front door if we do . I promised your mom . " <p> " All right . I told them about us being witches today . " <p> " Oh ? What did you say about me ? " <p> " Terry said you were more sophisticated . " <p> " Very nice , " he said to the air beside him . <p> " You 're sick ! " it responded . " You both are . " <p> " Works for me , " Danny said . Keeping a grip on her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . <p> This time I packed the car more carefully , keeping the passenger seat empty . Leaving my plant in More and Dad 's house helped . Terry said she 'd bring it down on her next visit . <p> I had stowed Terry 's two spells on the ledge below the speedometer , where I could reach them in a hurry . <p> I stopped at the stop sign on Main and stared at the town for a while , though there was no cross traffic to wait for . <p> Rexall Drugs , the Cinemart , True Value Hardware , the Blue Bird Care , David 's Department Store , Woolworth 's , with the dance school upstairs , Mountainview Tavern . I took some deep breaths , letting my hometown become a part of me . Overnight the maples had turned , summer 's dark and ragged green gone to yellow-gold . A log truck rolled past me , streaming diesel fumes from the exhaust pipe near its cab , and I took a breath of that , too . <p> Then I drove through town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway , the Leather Man stood . I pulled over to him and pushed the passenger door open , breathing in the taste of my possessions , breathing out fear . He climbed into the car , and I took my first breath of him . He tasted like the smoke of burning leaves . <p> My heart hammered . Air had told me this man and I would be together , and I did n't even know why . <p> He pulled the door shut and turned to look at me with his opalescent green eyes . I stared back , breathing . Breathing . <p> He lifted a dark calloused hand and touched my cheek . The breath I took then had a thousand flavors : Nepalese snow , Brazilian rainforest , Antarctic ice , Sahara sand , stone used to build an Indian temple a thousand years ago , needles from a bristlecone pine  --  each odor tagged so that I knew it without having ever tasted it before . " So you 're to be my daughter ? " he said , his voice as warm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . <p> " You 've entered the service of air ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " That 's a fine thing , " he said . " I 've been in the service a hundred and thirty-two years . It 's a life with a lot of travel in it ; you get a taste for the distant places . In all my time , I never met another of us until now . Air told me about you . Last time I had a name , it was Pierre Chandler . " <p> " Pierre , " I said . " My name is Tasha , and it 's all new to me . " <p> He smiled , his teeth white in his dark face . " That 's fine , " he said , " That 's just fine . I would admire to see somebody coming at this new . It 's all so amazing , but you forget just how amazing once you get used to it . I would purely appreciate it if you and I could spend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I take off in search of someplace I ai n't been yet . " <p> " Air told me , " I said . I swallowed . " Air told me you and I were going to be together . " <p> He smiled at me and patted my hair . " That scared you , an old mossback like me , did n't it ? " <p> After a moment , I nodded . <p> " You say me yea or nay , and I 'll abide by your wishes . " <p> Fear was just dust . I did n't need it anymore . " I would love to spend some time with you , " I said . <p> " I 'll show you some of my favorite secret places . There are woods here I ai n't walked in years  --  got ta taste ' em and see how time has changed ' em . " <p> " If we both go to the same places , are n't we duplicating our efforts ? " <p> " It do n't matter to air . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to . Besides , you 'll probably go off and breathe in space . Now , that 'll be new  --  too new for me , I 'm thinking . Separate or together , we 're doing our job . " <p> I smiled at him and put the car in gear . Together , we drove toward home . <p> I took another breath and tasted Canadian wilderness . No : home , like air , was everywhere . Together , we drove through home toward Spores Ferry . <p> <p> By Nina Kiriki Hoffman <p>
