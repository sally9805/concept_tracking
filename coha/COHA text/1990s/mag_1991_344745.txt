We do n't know about Elvis , but Walter Mitty lives . You can find him poised atop a 7-ft. platform swinging a big stick at a muscle-bound giant with a name like Laser or Nitro . Or swooping through the air on a bungee cord 15 ft. above the ground , trying to master a kind of aerial basketball . Sound like Mitty 's fantasies have got a little outrageous ? Obviously , you have n't seen American Gladiators , the syndicated television show on which ordinary , albeit very physically fit , people compete in athletic events against a squad of professional male and female athletes and body builders . <P> A wacky hybrid of sporting event , game show and Roman circus , American Gladiators has developed a strong cult following among both adults ( who root for the amateur challengers ) and kids ( who cheer on the cartoonlike gladiators ) . Ratings have nearly doubled since the show debuted two years ago , making it one of the top five weekly hours currently in syndication . Says gladiator Dan Clark , better known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got Wheel of Fortune ; for the guys who go shopping , you 've got The Price Is Right ; for the athlete , you 've got American Gladiators . " <P> This month the gladiators are hitting the road for a 100-city cross-country ; tour in which local jocks will have a chance to take on the titans . " The main attraction of Gladiators is that you can come down and be in the show , " says Michael Horton , who portrays the gladiator team leader Gemini . " We give the everyday blue-collar person who 's kept himself or herself in shape a chance to show what he or she can do . " So far , 25,000 have tried out for the television show , and legions more are expected to compete for a slot in the live contests . Just as on the television show , competitors will try to win points by completing tasks such as scaling a 30-ft. wall in 60 sec. , while the gladiators try to thwart their efforts . <P> Only the strongest survive . The very first round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 pull-ups , and women eight , in 30 sec. , eliminates up to 90% of all challengers . The field is further winnowed by subsequent requirements : running the 40-yd. dash in under 6 sec. , winning a one-on-one game of tug-of-war , and playing a round of Powerball , a brutal version of tag . <P> The Top Ten point winners to emerge from the national tour will meet in Atlantic City next May to compete for $50,000 in prizes . But the major attraction seems to be the chance for the average guy or gal to be more than an armchair athlete . " I 've always been pretty athletic , but competition is new to me , " says Joseph Mauro , 25 , a Brooklyn baker who made it through the trials in New York City . " I 'm excited about this because I want to meet those guys in the ring . " <P> Kids love the gladiators because their shows are like real-life video games with living heroes . " I like the way the gladiators make it seem so easy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches the TV show with his brother Brandon , 7 . The boys ' mother Stella is in favor too . " I like them liking the gladiators , " she says . " They 're good role models . They do n't do drugs , they eat the right foods , they take pride in their bodies . They give the children something to strive for . "
