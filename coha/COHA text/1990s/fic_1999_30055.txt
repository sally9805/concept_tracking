THE BOSTON GLOBE Jungle Drug Holds Promise for Heart Disease Researchers at Boston-based Newbury Pharmaceuticals are heralding what they say may be a major breakthrough in the treatment of heart disease , now America 's number one killer . . . . " YOU CA N'T THROW THE SEVEN OF HEARTS , BRIAN . I just picked up the eight of hearts three cards ago . " " I 'm betting you 've got eights . " " Okay . . . . Bad bet . . . . Gin . " Brian Holbrook watched his father score up gin plus nineteen and sweep the cards together with practiced ease . The hands that had once been thick and strong enough to crush walnuts were spotted from sixty-three years in the sun and bony from almost a decade of infirmity . But they could still handle cards . Jack Holbrook -- Black Jack Holbrook to many for as long as Brian could remember -- was n't a professional gambler . But he dearly loved to bet . He called it wagering , and he would do it on anything from the Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be foreign-made or domestic . Two bucks , ten , a hundred -- it really did n't matter to Jack . The game was the thing . He was , and always had been , the most fiercely competitive man Brian had ever known . Careful not to let his father see , Brian glanced at his watch . Three o'clock . They had been playing gin for almost two hours . At a penny a point , they kept a running score until one of them , invariably Jack , reached ten thousand . Brian was currently down over seventy dollars . " How about we quit and watch the ball game ? " he suggested . " How about we ride into Boston , have an early dinner , and see that new Van Damme movie ? " " I 've got to be at the club at nine . " " There 's plenty of time . I do n't remember the last time we spent a whole day together like this . " Jack was right about that . With two jobs and his weekly supervised visitations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dead asleep , facedown on the bedspread . The club was Aphrodite , one of the Day-Glo rock spots on Lansdowne Street , across from Fenway Park . Brian was a bouncer . At six three , 215 , he fit the part well , though at thirty-eight he was a bit long in the tooth for the work . Then , of course , there was the matter of his education . An M.D. degree with board certification in internal medicine and cardiology made him an oddity among the bouncers . But without a license from the Board of Registration and Discipline in Medicine , those certifications were useful only for the bottom of a birdcage . It was a rare totally free Sunday afternoon for him . Becky and Caitlin were away for the weekend at Phoebe 's parents ' place , so his weekly visitation was postponed until Tuesday . And for some reason , his boss at Speedy Rent-A-Car had n't noticed that he failed to slot Brian for yet another Sunday in the office . A career man at Speedy , Darryl loved exercising power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their entry into the job market . He had n't found out until well after Brian started work at the place that he was an M.D. , but since then , Darryl had done his best to make up for the lost time . Bouncer . . . car-rental gofer . . . supervised visitations with his daughters . . . living with Dad . . . Brian knew that after eighteen months of hard work -- counseling , Narcotics Anonymous meetings , and endless hours with his NA sponsor , Freeman Sharpe , a building maintenance man with twenty years of recovery from heroin addiction -- his internal demons were pretty much under control . But his external life still left a lot to be desired . Brian 's Saturday-night stint at Aphrodite had ended after three , so it was n't until ten that he had gotten up . He had planned to go for a run , and then maybe hook up with some of the kids playing touch football in the park . They loved having him in their game , especially when he sent one of them deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But one glance at Jack had changed his mind . The man who had been Brian 's football coach from Pop Warner to high school and on to college was wrapped in an afghan in his favorite chair , where he had been sitting up for most of the night . On the table next to him were several cardiac medications and others for pain . He looked drawn and in need of a shave . " Got any plans for the day , Coach ? " Brian asked " Yeah . The sultan of Brunei is supposed to stop by with his harem . I told him just three for me , though . " " How about I make you some breakfast ? " Jack 's gray crew cut , chiseled features , and lingering summer tan helped him look younger , and healthier , than he was . But Brian knew that his cardiac condition was worsening . Portions of his six-year-old quintuple bypass were almost certainly closing . Brian picked up the small vial of nitroglycerin tablets and checked inside . More than half were gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . Jack snatched the vial away and put it into his shirt pocket . " To tell you the truth , I do n't remember taking any . " " Jack , come on . " " Look , I 'm fine . You just tend to your business and let me tend to mine . " " You are my business , Jack . I 'm your son and I 'm a cardiologist , remember ? " " No . You 're a bouncer in a bar . That and a car salesman . " Brian started to react to the barb , then caught himself . Jack was probably operating on even less sleep than he was . " You 're right , Coach , " Brian responded , willing his jaw to unclench . " When I 'm back to being a cardiologist again , then I can give advice . Not before . Let me toast you a bagel . " The living room of the first-story flat that Jack had owned for the ten years since his heart attack was , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . There were sports photos on the walls and trophies on almost every surface that would hold one . Most of the awards had Brian 's name on them . They were the trappings of a man who needed gleaming hardware and laminated certificates to pump up his self-esteem . When Brian had first moved in , being surrounded by all those trophies had been something of a problem for him . But Freeman Sharpe had helped him deal with his issues . Remember , your dad loves you and he always wanted more for you than he ever wanted for himself . And if he pushes your buttons , just tell yourself that he 's a master at doing that because he 's the one who installed them in the first place . And in the end , as with so many other things that had seemed like a big deal , the trophies meant nothing more than Brian chose to make them . As he headed into the small kitchen , he glanced at one of the photographs on the wall by the doorway . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of his fateful junior season . He was in the middle of the next-to-last row . Number 11 . Then , for the first time that he could remember , his eyes were drawn to a face at the right-hand end of the very last row . Dr. Linus King , the team orthopedist . Brian had looked at the photo any number of times before -- where it hung , he had no real choice . It was curious that he had never noticed the man until now . Over countless therapy sessions and countless recovery meetings , Brian had come to accept responsibility for his addiction to prescription painkillers . But if there was anyone else who bore accountability , it was King . Brian repressed the sudden urge to slam his fist into the photo . Over the year following his reconstruction of Brian 's knee , Linus King , a sports-medicine deity , was always too busy to conduct a thorough reevaluation of his work , to say nothing of sitting down to talk with his patient about persistent discomfort in the joint . Instead , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percocets and other painkillers . Finally , a repeat MRI had disclosed a previously undiagnosed fracture . A cast and three months of rest took care of the cracked bone , but by then Brian had acquired a string of harried doctors , each willing to dash off a prescription in exchange for not having to listen . His addiction was full-blown and well-fed years before he violated the law and his own principles by writing the first prescription for himself . " Jack , do you really think you 're up for a trip into the city ? " Brian asked now . " I do n't know . I think so . I 'm going slightly stir-crazy , son . And beating you at gin is n't what I 'd call the most challenging activity in the world . " " I 'll tell you what . I 'll cut cards with you . You win , it 's Jean-Claude and the restaurant of your choice . " " And if I lose ? " Brian could tell his father knew what was coming . " You lose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promise me you 'll go back and see Dr. Clarkin . " " I 'm fine . " " You 're not fine . It 's been six years since your operation . Clarkin can revise those grafts or replace them . " " No more Clarkin , no more surgery . I 've told you that a thousand times . I 've had my last catheter and my last tube . " As often seemed to be the case with a physician or a physician 's kin , everything that could have gone wrong postoperatively for Jack did . Heart failure , infection , graft revision , reinfection . A total of eight miserable weeks in the hospital which , in the era of managed care , spoke volumes as to how spectacularly ill he was . For many of those weeks , he literally begged to die . True , Black Jack was more stubborn than most . But having seen the man every one of those fifty-six days , Brian could hardly blame him for taking such a hard line against any return to the OR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen you chicken out of a friendly wager before . " " That 's because I have a reputation for always paying up on my losses . And I know I 'd end up welshing on this one . Tell you what . How about one cut : the seventy-one bucks you owe me versus you treating for dinner and the movies . " " Deal . " Brian turned over the queen of clubs . " Hey , maybe my luck is changing . " Jack cut the three of diamonds . He stared at the card for a few protracted seconds . " Maybe mine is , too , " he said . He pulled on his favorite sweater , a frayed orange cardigan Brian 's mother had given him just before her death nearly thirteen years ago . " You gon na be warm enough if I put the top down ? " Brian asked . " Sure . . . . Um . . . son , there 's something I got ta get off my chest before we leave . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of line saying what I did this morning about you not being a cardiologist . " " Do n't worry about it . Besides , I never paid any attention to anything you ever said before . Why should I start now ? " " I 'm frustrated , that 's all . And I do n't understand how you could have let this happen . " " I know , Pop . I know . Sometimes we have to hit bottom before we figure out how to really enjoy life . " " I 'm sure something will come along . " Brian looked away . " I 'm sure it will , " he said . Actually , he was reasonably certain it would n't . The Board of Registration in Medicine had determined six months ago that he was in good recovery and ready to resume practice , but it was their policy in drug and alcohol cases to insist on a physician having a work situation in place with tight on-the-job monitoring and random urine testing before a license would be issued . No job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brian had argued that in Boston , with three medical schools and a plethora of teaching hospitals , cardiologists were more plentiful than cod . Why would anyone take a chance on hiring someone without an active license ? Two children and Jack 's shaky medical situation made a move too far away from eastern Massachusetts out of the question . So Brian had done what he could , responding to ads in the cardiology press and the New England Journal of Medicine and sending out at least two dozen resumes . He had networked until he had absorbed more than his quota of rejections , and had seen colleagues he thought were his friends turn away . He had even placed an ad himself . Former chief of cardiology and cath-lab director at Boston-area hospital seeks group practice in eastern Mass , Rhode Island , southern New Hampshire . No job , no license . No license , no job . Catch-22 . Now , for the past month , he had simply stopped trying . He had stepped back and begun to mull over other directions in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been easy , but there was one saving grace . Rarely , in all these frustrating months of rejection and disappointment , had he thought about drinking or taking pills . " You ready , Pop ? " " You go on and get that top down . I 'll be right there . " Jack Holbrook headed slowly toward the bathroom . When he heard the front door open and close , he quickly braced himself against the wall , fighting to slow his breathing as a skewer of pain bored up to his jaws from beneath his breastbone . He fumbled the vial of nitroglycerin from his shirt pocket and dissolved one under his tongue . Half a minute later , the pain began to subside . He wiped beaded sweat from his upper lip and took a long , grateful breath . " Jack , everything okay ? " Brian called from the front steps . " Yeah , fine , Brian . Everything 's fine . " The Towne Deli was a trendy little place on Boylston with a fine salad bar and nine-dollar sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes finding a parking space . Jack 's condo was in Reading , a working-class suburb that straddled Route 128 northwest of the city . The ride in , beneath brilliant late-afternoon sun , was as much of a joy on Sunday as it was a nightmare during the typical morning commute . And Brian 's three-year-old red LeBaron , by far the best thing he retained after the divorce , was the perfect car for the day . During the drive , Brian knew that Jack wanted information . Any job prospects ? Any new word from the board ? Any interesting women ? But perhaps in honor of the warmth of the day and the peace between them , his dad kept his thoughts to himself . Brian , too , avoided the inflammatory topic of his father 's health . Instead , they alternated between sports and silence . Brian entered the Towne Deli and spotted his father at a small table in the corner . For a few seconds , he stood by the front door , studying what remained of the man who had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the day Brian took his first step , Coach was there , monitoring his diet , social life , and workouts , creating what he believed would be one of the great quarterbacks . And save for one play , he might have succeeded . Jack sat motionless , staring down at the menu . Then , almost subconsciously , he began rubbing at his chest and up toward his neck . Brian hurried across to him . Beneath his tan , Jack was ashen . His eyes were glazed . " Jack , what 's going on ? Are you having pain ? " Jack Holbrook took a breath through his nose and nodded . " Some , " he managed in a half-grunt . Brian checked the carotid pulses on either side of Jack 's neck . They were regular , but thready . A sheen of sweat had formed across his forehead . " Jesus , " Brian whispered . " Jack , do you have your nitro ? " Jack produced the bottle from his shirt pocket . " Should n't have come into Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sensing the strange , paradoxical calmness that for many years now had been his response to a medical crisis . " It would n't have made any difference . Come on , Pop . I 'm going to sit you over here on the floor and give you one of your nitros . Do you still have that aspirin I put in your wallet ? Good . Let me get it out . " Either Jack was having a bad angina attack -- not enough blood flow to a portion of his heart -- or he was having a full-blown coronary : a myocardial infarction in which the heart segment was getting no blood at all . If the problem was an artery obstructed by a clot , the extra aspirin might help dissolve the blockage before there was permanent damage . " Is there a problem , sir ? " Brian looked up at the balding restaurant manager . Of course not , I always put my father on the floor in restaurants . " He 's a heart patient and he 's having chest pain , " Brian said instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ask if there 's a doctor here ? " " I am a doctor , " Brian said , for the first time in a year and a half . " And I think an ambulance would be an excellent idea . " Silently , Brian cursed himself for giving in to the Boston trip . Jack 's internist , cardiologist , surgeon , and all his records were at Suburban Hospital , way on the other side of Route 128 . It was an excellent hospital , well known for its orthopedics , rehabilitation medicine , and in some circles , for a former chief of cardiology named Brian Holbrook . He checked Jack 's pulses once again and mopped his brow . " How 's your pain , Jack ? One to ten . " " Six . The nitro 's helping . What are the odds it 's a coronary ? " " Fifty-fifty . " " Bad odds . " " Just hang in there . The EMTs 'll get a little oxygen going and give you some pain medicine , and you 'll feel much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMTs in the ambulance is a woman . Deal ? " " Deal . Just stay cool . Do you want to lie down flat ? " " I could n't . " In the distance , they could hear an approaching siren . Brian kept a constant check of the pulse at Jack 's wrist . The perspiration , so typical of a cardiac event , seemed less heavy . " Everything 's fine , Pop . How 's the pain now ? " " Ten . " " The pain is up to a ten ? " " No , you owe me ten . " Jack nodded toward the door , where a young brunette in blue EMT coveralls was on the pulling end of a stretcher . Brian introduced his father and gave a capsule summary of the situation and the limited treatment he had instituted . " You a doctor ? " The young woman asked immediately . " A cardiologist . Brian Holbrook . " " Well , we got no pride on this team , Dr. Holbrook , " she said , doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing them all well . " If there 's anything we overlook , just call it out . " " Thanks . Jack 's a patient at Suburban Hospital . " " Well , in a few minutes he 's going to be a patient at White Memorial . That okay with you ? " White Memorial was not only the best hospital in the city , it was the home of Boston Heart Institute , one of the foremost centers of its kind . Brian flashed on the interview he had blown when applying for cardiology training there . The subsequent rejection letter was hardly a surprise . Given all that had happened to him since then , he mused , it seemed the interviewer had shown pretty good judgment . Brian noted Jack 's immediate improvement with a bit of IV morphine and some oxygen . " Actually , " he said to the young EMT , " Boston Heart is precisely where I was going to ask to have him taken . "                @ @ @ @ @
