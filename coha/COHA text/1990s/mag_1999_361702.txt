Once upon a time , just a few years ago , two women fell in love with each other . They would have married if the law allowed it . They wanted very much to have a child . And so they did , through artificial insemination . One partner gave birth to a beautiful girl named Zoey , and both shared in her care . For several years they were a happy ' 90s family like the one depicted in the controversial children 's book Heather Has Two Mommies . <P> But then the mommies began to fight and , like so many couples these days , decided to break up . And now the woman who gave birth to Zoey is blocking her former partner from seeing the five-year-old child . The other woman is suing for custody rights . And a state appeals court in Florida is struggling with some heart-rending questions . Who exactly qualifies as a child 's parent in the eyes of the law ? Can a woman who behaves as a mother to a child be kept away from that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 40 , a disabled Army veteran in Palm Bay , Fla. , is the woman being kept from seeing the little girl she has helped to rear , and she thinks she knows the answers to the tough questions . She thinks anyone does , if she listens to her heart . A mother , Kazmierazak says , , without pay . She adds , " It 's easy for a child to have two moms "  --  and the child does n't care which one gave birth to her . <P> That 's the proposition that Kazmierazak has placed before the Florida appeals judges . Much of her evidence is stuffed into a scrapbook that she hugged to her chest during a court hearing last month . It includes a sperm-donor list , the stick from an early pregnancy test that still shows the positive lines indicating a baby had been conceived , ultrasound pictures of Zoey in the womb and a letter from Kazmierazak 's former partner . It reads : " Thank you for having our beautiful little girl with me ... You are her mommy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that . I promise you . " The evidence has not been heard in court . <P> That former partner , Zoey 's biological mom , is Pam Query , 37 , whose job for years has been caring for her ailing mother . She and her lawyer have not argued the facts of the case so much as the law  --  and the law , so far , has been on their side . When Kazmierazak first sought custody rights , the trial court ruled she had no standing in the case . Florida law recognizes parental rights of custody only for biological or adoptive parents and grandparents . Kazmierazak is none of these . <P> Most states allow what is called a second-parent adoption , which allows a person to adopt the children of his or her partner without ending the partner 's parental status . But Florida is not one of those states . So Kazmierazak and her lawyers are , in essence , asking the appeals court to interpret the law broadly and consider her role as a parent and the best interests of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Illinois , could set new precedents for the rights of nonbiological or " psychological " parents . Steve Scarborough , a lawyer for the Lambda Legal Defense Fund , which promotes homosexual rights and is representing Kazmierazak , says courts in New Mexico , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have " recognized the harm that comes to children when relationships with nonbiological parents are severed .
