The people responsible for The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer  --  a moronic sitcom scheduled to make its debut on UPN this week unless the network experiences a late and totally unprecedented attack of good taste , common sense and plain old decency  --  describe it as a " high concept " period comedy . That must mean they were smoking some dynamite stuff when they dreamed it up . <P> No one , not even in Hollywood , would have ventured out with a show based on the preposterous premise that during the Civil War , an English nobleman of Moorish descent somehow winds up in America , where he maneuvers himself into a position on Abraham Lincoln 's kitchen staff , unless he or she were intoxicated . Once they sobered up and checked out the pilot episode  --  a heavy-handed , totally unfunny spoof of the current White House scandal  --  they would have asked themselves , " What were we thinking ? " and pulled the plug on the series out of sheer embarrassment . <P> As if some black folks needed another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white folks still just do n't get it . After a tape of the Pfeiffer pilot got out , it set off yet another overheated racial contretemps in Los Angeles . Like actors following the script of a bad sitcom about political correctness , a coalition of black organizations and politicians pulled out the rhetorical artillery to try to force UPN to cancel Pfeiffer ( the P , as what passes for witty dialogue on the show constantly reminds us , is n't silent ) before it ever airs . " The show trivializes the suffering and pain of African-American people during the period of slavery . It distorts and exploits history and desecrates the bones of our ancestors ! " thundered Danny Bakewell , president of the Brotherhood Crusade , a black activist group . Last week he led pickets outside the Paramount studios , where Pfeiffer is shot . " They would n't do anything comedic about the Jewish Holocaust , and rightfully so , " said Bakewell . The Los Angeles city council unanimously passed a motion introduced by a black member , Mark Ridley-Thomas , requiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human relation commission to report back within 10 days on whether the show is appropriate for broadcast . <P> Those actions gave UPN president Dean Valentine a pretext for wrapping himself in the banner of artistic freedom , as any savvy television executive would do if one of his shows came under fire . " If I was a creative person in Hollywood , I would be packing up my bags and heading for Nevada , " Valentine declared . " In a city that has a host of social problems , including crime and poverty , potholes and a broken-down transit system , one would think the vast power of the city council could be put to better use than analyzing UPN 's Monday-night schedule . " Still , in an attempt to defuse the flap , the network yanked the pilot and substituted an episode titled " Abe Online , " which depicts the Great Emancipator ( played by Dann Florek ) carrying on an illicit romance via the telegraph .                   @ @
