Russia is not a land accustomed to elections  --  to say nothing of electoral surprises . But last week the country got a big one . Within an hour of the polls ' closing in Russian parliamentary elections Sunday night , a new and fairly mysterious party called Unity took the lead and held it for most of the night as results came in from across Russia 's 11 time zones . And though in the final tally Unity had slipped behind the Communist Party , it was an astounding upset . A group that was founded just three months ago and that had scarcely campaigned will be a major force in the new Duma . <P> This was , however , an unusual election , and not just in the outcome . Outwardly democratic , it was in fact an exercise in political ruthlessness . The TV marathons that tracked Unity 's surge were the nearest to Western-style elections that these polls got . Much of the campaign was an enigma . There were few rallies , cross-country tours by party leaders , debates or televised appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a stream of invective on state TV . Most of this was instigated by the Kremlin and aimed at discrediting the one bloc thought to present any risk to Boris Yeltsin : the Fatherland-All Russia coalition , led by former Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov and Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov . <P> The " technology " worked . While the Unity Party ended up neck and neck with the communists , Fatherland-All Russia came in a disappointing third . It was an expression of what Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev described as Russia 's split soul : torn between the attraction of anarchy on the one hand and the desire for a firm ruler on the other . Some past elections have demonstrated the anarchic side . This time , though , Russians opted for a ruler . <P> They found him in 47-year-old Prime Minister Vladimir Putin : his youth , his sportsman 's bearing , his precisely phrased and brutally delivered statements  --  all so different from the doddering Yeltsin and his mangled , half-incomprehensible public utterances . In the past few months , as Russian troops have streamed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential elections wo n't take place until next June , the Duma outcome was widely seen as a sign of Putin 's strength . A vote for Unity was , in most Russian minds , a vote for Putin . Immediately after last week 's results were known , the Prime Minister 's aides fanned out among the news bureaus of Moscow , driving home the message that their boss was a shoo-in for the presidency . They admitted slight embarrassment about the wildly biased coverage of the campaign on state TV . But , they maintained , Putin 's endorsement of Unity was essential . <P> Unity 's leaders , almost invisible during the campaign , were silent after it . It is a peculiar party . Unity has virtually no platform , almost no organization ( especially in contrast to the nation 's Communist Party ) and only a handful of visible leaders . What it does have is the backing of the Kremlin . The party was formed last September by Sergei Shoigu , who serves as Putin 's Emergencies Minister , a position in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
