Sundquist , Belknap Press , Harvard University Press , 705 pp. , $ 29.95 . <p> CLIMBING JACOB 'S LADDER : THE ENDURING LEGACY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES By Andrew Billingsley , Simon &; Schuster , 446 pp. , $ 27.50 . <p> THERE is such a flow of books by , for , and about African-Americans these days that just about any issue from any time period is discussed in paperback or hardcover . Three new books lifted from the stream are noteworthy . Unknown Los Angeles <p> With an admirable , tough grace , Lynell George writes about a different kind of black Los Angeles - not the city reduced by the mainstream press and movies to a smeared wall along the freeway . In that kind of Los Angeles , people are virtually as anonymous as the freeway ; beyond the cement , all gangs are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same senseless reasons month after month . The myth that little of value is fostered in black Los Angeles becomes so huge it is institutionalized . <p> But George , a writer for LA Weekly , profiles black Angelenos ( and a few others ) who quietly work , live , and create as if a community project , a church or a neighborhood school , and even a poem are there to nurture the concept of individuality , as well as any individual who comes along . The 25 or so hard-working people she writes about in " No Crystal Stair : African-Americans in the City of Angels " measure worth the old-fashioned way , by how much they serve their fellow men and women . <p> Levi Kingston , for instance , a jaunty but tenacious community organizer and activist for 20 years , is so well-known and respected in an area bordering the University of Southern California that a fellow worker says of him , " The essence of Levi , when it comes right down to it , is that he 'll put bread on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George does the same for the reader . If you are white , black , or some wonderful color in between , and the press accounts of riotous Los Angeles scare the beejeebies out of you , OK , she says , meet V.G. Guinses , or Leon Watkins , or Anyim Palmer . George knows the other Los Angeles is still out there , but this trio is laboring on the front lines of hope . <p> George says the first two , whose efforts are chronically underfunded , have programs that try to surprise tough kids with some doses of self-worth , jobs , and schooling , all designed to help them make the break from gangs . <p> And Dr. Palmer , the all-purpose principal and founder of " the fastest growing black independent school in Los Angeles " says surprisingly , " I was very fortunate to have gone to the old-type segregated schools . My teachers loved me . They saw me as an extension of themselves , and they probably would have committed mass suicide had I graduated from school not being able to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing style , even as she blends local history and the eyewitness account , is much like a beam of soft light . Wherever it falls in black Los Angeles , particularly in her short essays at the back of the book , she is a rare journalistic illuminator of larger humanity and ideas . Los Angeles needs her . Cultural intersections <p> In the world of black literature and music springing out of predominately white American culture , Eric Sundquist is fascinated with the resulting intersections in " To Wake The Nations : Race in The Making of American Literature . " <p> Ranging over these intersections in folklore , vernacular culture , revolutionary ideology , the role of music in black culture , and historical time-frames such as Reconstruction , Sundquist first agrees with black novelist Zora Neale Hurston : " The exchange and re-exchange of ideas between groups , " are what shapes civilization , he writes . <p> Then he goes to work to prove his point , a lucid voice , not at all too serious , but wanting the reader to understand - like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . <p> For instance , consider the " cakewalk , " a Sunday dance performed by slaves who dressed up in " hand-me-down finery to do a high-kicking , prancing walk-around . " <p> Sundquist quotes a former slave , Shepard Edmonds , on what the cakewalk meant to blacks . The slaves " did a takeoff on the high manners of the folks in the ' big house , ' but their masters , who gathered around to watch the fun , missed the point . " <p> The point was satire , burlesque , " liberating caricature , " as Sundquist calls it . Other researchers connect the cakewalk to the African circle dance and the slaves ring shout ( which was part of a 1913 all-black Broadway revue , " The Darktown Follies " ) . <p> Eventually , the cakewalk became so popular , writes Sundquist , that in the mid-1890s national championships were held in New York 's Madison Square Garden . John Philip Sousa introduced the cakewalk at the Paris Exposition in 1900 . <p> But assimilation and ambiguity set in . Cakewalk music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized as a " sex dance , " and when danced by whites in high society , it became a link to jazz dancing in the early 20th century . Although Sundquist does n't suggest it , maybe even modern break-dancing could be traced to the cakewalk . <p> More literate examples of this kind of black-and-white cross-pollination in books and music thread through the three main sections in the book . The last focuses on the writings of W.E.B . Dubois , particularly a discussion of the importance of " The Sorrow Songs , " or spirituals . Were they really black in origin , or musically polyglot ? <p> Despite occasional riffs of density , Sundquist 's writing glides along , blending the academic tone with a conversational timbre . His arguments are developed with brilliant comprehensiveness , which no doubt will be challenged at some points by other academics , but can be milked by the lay reader for any number of insights into the origins of American culture . Changing family patterns <p> How strong is the black family today ? Andrew Billingsley , writing in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Families , " looks at the historical evolution of black families and concludes that black family strength today lies in its ability to adapt to changing conditions . <p> Alternating between analysis , facts , and short profiles of successful black people under different living arrangements , Billingsley has a kind of thudding abruptness to the development of his ideas . Often missing is value judgment - not in the sense of condemnation or approval of differing family arrangements , but rather in raising the question , is this the way it should continue to be ? <p> On the one hand , he seems to be asserting that blacks have their own definition of family - much more informal than whites or other groups - and yet he says , " the value placed on marriage is still so strong that a majority of African-American youths and adults want to be married . " <p> Yet later he writes that " both black men and women have been avoiding or abandoning marriage in record numbers during recent years . But this is more a shift in the marriage relation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to an " intergenerational kinship unit , " and seems to define it as people living in different places who once lived together with some part of a family . One guesses that different kinds of roots develop with this arrangement , or is it no roots at all ? <p> In essence , Billingsley offers readers everything they wanted to know about black families , nuclear , extended , and augmented . He concludes that the functioning of families , white or black , is determined by large-scale societal forces . If whites are more resistant to society 's destructive forces , he says , " it is because they are more privileged and protected . " <p> What provides spiritual as well as community roots for black families is the changing black church . Today a black person walks through church doors as much for personal salvation as for social salvation . Billingsley details the work of a dozen churches with extraordinary community out-reach programs .
