<p> It is hard to miss the buzz at Corning Inc. ' s Sullivan Park research labs . Never mind that they are smack in the middle of a sleepy rural town . The air virtually crackles with excitement . <p> Some 600 scientists doing research in photonics  --  the lasers , amplifiers and other equipment that blast signals down the fiber optic pipelines of modern telecommunications  --  swarm the lab 's 11 acres , trading ideas and rushing back to their cramped rooms to test concepts on high-speed machines . Many operate out of makeshift trailers out back , while Corning scrambles to double the number of scientists and add three acres to the overcrowded building . <p> " In three years , we 've gone from a nonbusiness to one growing by a factor of 10 , " said Christine G. Sharkey , director of finance and mergers for photonic technologies . <p> But the bet in photonics has come at a price , and in Corning 's executive suite , just a few miles from the labs , the mood is subdued . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding what creaky old businesses to sacrifice to pay for the great leap into telecommunications . Last year , they spun off Corning 's medical testing and drug research businesses . Now comes the latest and most painful parting of all . They looked at the question from every angle , yet the same answer kept coming up : Corning 's $630 million housewares business  --  which after a period of downsizings had just tripled its profits  --  has to go . <p> Analysts figure it could bring $650 million , and Corning wants the cash to make acquisitions in fiber optics . " You ca n't do everything in life , and housewares does n't fit our portfolio anymore , " said Roger G. Ackerman , Corning 's chief executive . <p> Even so , the decision has created a mood of nervous expectancy here , a mixture of fear and hope about what the change portends . <p> True , dumping an old-line business is commonplace these days : Rockwell International dropped its aerospace and automotive operations , and Westinghouse Electric plans to spin off its industrial businesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies . By contrast , the fortunes and history of Corning Inc. and Corning , N.Y. , are so closely bound that almost any move the company makes looms larger than life . <p> Company towns rarely play the role they once did in American business life , when manufacturers from the Ford Motor Company to Bethlehem Steel dominated almost every corner of the civic scene . But that is still the case in Corning , where most of the 11,900 residents either work for the company , did once or have children , parents or neighbors who do . And even though , in their heads , they know that Corning is staying put  --  indeed , even growing  --  in their hearts they sense that an era is ending . <p> After all , Corning not only invented Pyrex ; to many people , Corning is Pyrex  --  and Corning Ware , and Corelle , and all the other cookware that has made it a household name . Justified or not , some residents worry that Corning will turn its back on them the same way it is turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are anxious about their jobs , " said Peter F. Campanella , who runs the consumer-products unit . <p> He insists they should not be . Corning says it will sell only to a buyer who agrees to keep the housewares business based in Corning and accepts Corning 's contract with the American Flint Glass Workers . And it has certified the union for an optical communications plant it is building less than five miles away . <p> " They could have built the plant down South , " said a grateful Stephen A. Mandell Sr. , president of the union 's Corning local , which has more than 400 members in the housewares plant . Corning employs a total of 6,700 people in the town and surrounding region . <p> Corning has switched directions before . The company was the first to enclose Thomas Alva Edison 's filament in glass , yet sold its lighting business when light bulbs became a commodity . In 1992 , it wrote off its investment  --  and 25 percent of its earnings  --  in Dow Corning , the joint venture that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at reinventing ourselves , " Mr. Ackerman said . <p> Still , in terms of raising community angst , the timing of the decision to sell the housewares unit was spectacularly bad . It came just a year after Mr. Ackerman took over from Jamie Houghton , a scion of Corning 's founding family , and right after a spate of defections by high-level women and blacks . <p> Some residents wondered aloud whether Mr. Ackerman lacked Mr. Houghton 's loyalty to Corning 's heritage and values . In supermarket lines and at dinner parties , they expressed doubts that the Houghtons would have abandoned housewares . Rumors sprouted all over , with one newspaper even suggesting that the union would buy the housewares plant  --  a report that Mr. Mandell called ridiculous . <p> The grumbling grew so loud last month that Mr. Houghton held a news conference just to say that he had signed on to the sale . " I have pots and pans in my blood , but sometimes you just have to move on , " he said in a recent interview . <p> Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its much lauded commitment to equal opportunity . But some blacks and women are complaining that the company is holding them back . " The focus has moved away from diversity , so there are fewer women and black men in the pipeline to management , " said Susan B. King , a former president of Corning 's Steuben Glass subsidiary . That is why Dawn M. Cross , a black woman who was Corning 's diversity officer , left in late 1995 . " There was only a woman or two above me on the hierarchy and no blacks , " she said . <p> Mr. Ackerman understands the source of the complaints . He notes that Corning 's controller is a woman and that the company has six women plant managers and numerous blacks in middle management . But " no one has popped through to the executive committee yet , and if I were a female or black employee , I 'd be militant , too , " he said . <p> If the change at Corning troubles some employees , for many locals it promises economic salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers and other investors who , he hopes , can add a spark to a downtown that still empties out at dark . A cybercafe and microbrewery are scheduled to open soon , and there is a plan to add apartments to some downtown commercial buildings . <p> Yet even Mr. Friess allows himself a moment of regret . " We 'll wind up better off , but yes , it is bittersweet . " <p> There are no such qualms on Wall Street . " It makes no sense for Corning to divert resources to housewares when telecommunications is booming , " said Lissa Bogaty , an analyst with Prudential Securities . <p> Indeed , Corning and its archcompetitor , Lucent Technologies , are both rushing to meet a worldwide shortage of optical fiber and cable . Each says its products , which differ in the way the fibers are bundled in the cable , are better ; customers say it is a wash . <p> " It 's like comparing Ford and Chevy pickups , " said Kenny W. Goodsell , who buys fiber cable from Lucent for Southwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Alcoa Fujikara , a joint venture of the Aluminum Company of America that makes fiber optic products , buys its optical fiber from Corning . Why ? The answer , basically , is why not ? " We 're growing at 30 percent a year , yet they still manage to meet our increasing needs , " said Frank M. Larence , the division 's president . <p> But it is technology , not service , that will dictate supremacy in photonics . Lucent and Corning are racing to make cables that can carry the most signals , and thus meet the insatiable demand for more bandwidth  --  capacity to send signals  --  of an Internet-crazed world . <p> And both keep introducing new amplifiers , which boost the signals at regular intervals along the way . These are particularly important for telephone companies , which must operate expensive electrical regenerators every few hundred miles . <p> Corning , which invented fiber optics two decades ago , insists it is way up the learning curve . " Our competitors must keep running to keep up , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . <p> Not so , countered Gerald J. Butters , president for North America of Lucent 's Network Systems Group . Bell Labs , most of which went with Lucent when it was spun off from AT &T; last year , invented the laser , he said , and laser technology is the more important learning curve . " Lasers , microelectronics , these are not easy capabilities to develop if you 've been organized around making glass , " Mr. Butters said . <p> Corning worries that that perception is widespread . Last month , for the first time , the company flew 60 analysts to its optical fiber plant in Wilmington , N.C. It did not allow cameras , and it kept some of its newest manufacturing processes off limits . But even so , the tour was a sea change for the normally secretive company , which even altered some photographs in its 1996 annual report to keep its latest manufacturing wrinkles under wraps . <p> Apparently , analysts were impressed . " If plastics was the place to be in the 1950 's , photonics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NatWest . Mark Hassenberg of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette added , " Corning is in sexy businesses that people pay high multiples for . " <p> Investors seem happy , too . Corning 's stock , which hovered around the mid-$30 's for years , has soared in the last 18 months . It closed at $55 Thursday , up 75 cents a share . <p> Presumably , the stock will go even higher if Corning gets a good price for housewares . Corning is mum on prospects , but analysts say the Newell Company , which bought Corning 's European housewares operation last year , is a logical buyer . Newell is cagey about its plans . " I wo n't say whether Corning fits in with us , " said Ross A. Porter Jr. , a Newell spokesman , " but our Anchor Hocking glassware and Miro cookware sell to the housewares market . " <p> The sale will not leave Corning as a pure photonics concern . Corning , which invented the ceramic material used in catalytic converters , is exploring other forms of catalytic reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer screens will get a big lift with the advent of flat-screen desk-top computers . And its high-purity fused silica , used to make space shuttle windows and telescopes , is also used in wafer steppers , the machines that etch patterns on silicon chips . <p> Still , Mr. Ackerman concedes , none of these products have the tradition or panache of Corning Ware . " The decision to sell consumer drove us into agony , " he said . " But you have a dollar in your hand , you have to ask where it gets the most leverage . " <p> To focus on more profitable high technology businesses  --  like fiber optics , an industry is helped create in 1970  --  Corning earlier this year spun off two medical diagnostic companies to shareholders . Now , the company that became a household name because of its glass and kitchenware has put that consumer business up for sale , too . Once the sale is completed , Corning will be roughly half the size it was but will have great expectations for growth .
