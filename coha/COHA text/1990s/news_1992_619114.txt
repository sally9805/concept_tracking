<p> THERE 'S a moment in the musical " Grand Hotel " when the ne'er-do-well German baron confesses his love for the beautiful , worldly ballerina . " But you 're so young , " she says wearily . " I have toe shoes older than you . " <p> Liliane Montevecchi , who plays the fading ballet star in the musical , gives a burst of throaty French laughter as she describes the scene . <p> " Yes , there are parallels with my own life , " she says . " I was a ballerina . I am the same age as the character . She declines to give the age . And , yes , young men do fall in love with me . " <p> " Grand Hotel , " which opens Wednesday at the Golden Gate Theater , is based on Vicki Baum 's 1929 novel set in a luxury hotel in 1928 Berlin . The well-remembered film version , which starred Greta Garbo , presented the ambience of the hotel , but concentrated on the ballerina 's center-stage love story . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , interweaving boardrooms and ballrooms , romance and scandal , lust and love , swindle and survival . <p> As she settles into a corner table at Regina 's , Montevecchi , who was nominated for a Tony in the Broadway production , says , " I was well cast for the role . " That 's why nine-time Tony winner Tommy Tune ( who picked up two Tonys as director and choreographer of " Grand Hotel " ) persuaded her to star in the touring production . " Tommy feels that people who can not afford to come to New York should see Broadway shows on tour with Broadway stars . And anyway , " she adds , chuckling , " the critics ca n't compare me with the one on Broadway , because I am the one on Broadway . " <p> Tune , she says , created the musical with her in mind . " He called me up one day and said that he 'd just seen a film that had a wonderful part in it for me and that it was mine , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " marks the second collaboration for Montevecchi and Tune . Their first , " Nine , " landed Tonys for both of them . She auditioned for that part during a visit to New York to see her best friend Jacqueline Stone , Oliver Stone 's French mother . " I sang ' La Vie en Rose ' without accompaniment . The following day I was told I had the part of the producer . " <p> Originally it was a man 's role , but Tune  --  who knew and loved Montevecchi 's work from the " Folies Bergere " in Paris  --  rewrote and enlarged the role for her . Composer Maury Yeston wrote for her the song , " Folies Bergere , " that gave Montevecchi the edge that won her the Tony Award . <p> " My getting the role comes from right timing in my life , " she says matter-of-factly . " My life has always been that way . One job just comes after another . Years ago I was in Hollywood when David Merrick heard about me and called to say he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' La Plume Ma Tante . ' Although I had never done comedy , I did that one for two years . I believe that if one is open , one receives . " <p> Montevecchi has performed in ballet , Hollywood films , stage , television and cabaret in this country ; and for close to 10 years she starred in the " Folies Bergere " in Paris , New York and Las Vegas . Despite her varied and nonstop career , she claims that she is not ambitious . <p> " For me things unfold so easily . I do n't know why , but it 's always been . I 'm happy that I work and take what 's given , but I will never push or destroy things to do it . " <p> When she was 9 years old , Montevecchi 's mother suggested that she take ballet lessons . " My mother wanted to be a ballerina but in her day it was not fashionable . But she did not push me . She asked if I wanted to do it and I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft at the dance conservatory taking four- hour daily ballet lessons , and when she was 18 auditioned for Roland Petit , who was forming a new ballet company . After four months in the corps de ballet , Petit promoted her to ballerina . At 21 she was prima ballerina . " He saw something in me and and he pushed me like mad , " she says . <p> When the company performed in New York , director/actor John Houseman was in the audience and liked the look of her . He suggested that she go to Hollywood , make a test and try for a film contract . <p> Once again the timing was right . Petit informed his dancers that he was disbanding the company , and Montevecchi headed for Hollywood . " If Petit had not disbanded the ballet , I would never have gone to Hollywood . Today I would probably be teaching dancing somewhere . " <p> Her film test won her a seven- year contract with MGM but she never became an established actress . Her minor movie roles included Fritz Lang 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1955 ) , " Daddy Long Legs " ( 1955 ) , " The Young Lions " ( 1958 ) , " The Sad Sack " ( 1957 ) and " King Creole " ( 1958 ) . <p> " I never really enjoyed Hollywood . Learning how to speak English , how to sing , how to fence . Lessons from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon . And I did n't like the technical part of film . Repeating everything 10 times , to make it perfect . I was young and impatient . It made me cranky . " <p> But she does remember the people she met in Hollywood with great fondness . " The creme de la creme . Orson Welles wrote me a ballet . " French friend Jacques Bergerac , married at the time to Ginger Rogers , introduced her to Rex Ross " this extremely beautiful doctor " who left glamorous Merle Oberon to live with Montevecchi . He was older and introduced her to many of Hollywood 's top stars , including Clark Gable . " We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm against killing animals . Clark never ate anything because he was a little too far gone from drinking beer all morning . " <p> She also met Norma Shearer , whose career at MGM crested when she was the wife of producer Irving Thalberg . Although she was much older than Montevecchi when they met , the two became close friends and the young French actress learned a great deal from her . <p> " She taught me humility . And how to grow old with no complaints . Now I grow old gracefully , because I accept it . Everything is fine , except the skin is not as elastic as it used to be . That , I admit , bugs me . Otherwise everything is fine . " <p> Even as a woman of " a certain age " Montevecchi has the graceful , gaunt body of a dancer , and the expressive heavily made-up eyes of an old-time MGM star . <p> Talking about her ballerina role in " Grand Hotel , " she says , " In film you can have a close-up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no cheating . That is why ballet class is my discipline . Why I practice every day of my life . " <p> Although she felt secure about the dancing , she admits to some trouble about portraying a Russian ballerina . " Trying a Russian accent over my English became so thick that no one understood a word . I was miserable . Tommy saw that . So he made me a French ballerina instead . " <p> Montevecchi  --  whom cast members call " madame " out of respect  --  says she would like to act in films again . " Before I was sexpot . Now I am ready to do character parts . " <p> One of Montevecchi 's trademarks is always dressing in a single color . On this day she is all in red , including a red hat . " I love to wear hats . My hair is very thin , very fine . If the wind blows I look like a rat instead of an elegant woman . " <p> Elegance she learned from her mother , whom she adored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was extremely elegant and beautiful , " Montevecchi says . " She always wore high heels , even in the kitchen . I also wear heels , never anything like sneakers . Her image is in my mind , and I try always to be elegant in her memory . " <p> SHE believes that the quality of elegance she exudes in " Grand Hotel " makes the audiences believe that a young man can fall in love with the older ballerina . Offstage , she knows it can happen : " The man in my life is much younger than I. " <p> But she admits that , like the ballerina , she is happiest onstage  --  so happy that she is planning to do her one-woman show , " On the Boulevard , " at the Mason Street Theatre on Friday and Saturday nights at 11 , after her performances at the Golden Gate Theater . " I 'm attracted to costumes and light , " she says . " I like the excitement of it . " <p> Montevecchi has never married " because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheats . Work does not . I am faithful to my work . "
