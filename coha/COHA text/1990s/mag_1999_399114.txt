Section : SPECIAL EDITORIAL <p> This September marked the thirtieth birthday of the Internet , though historians may quibble . It was in September 1969 that UCLA 's Professor Leonard Kleinrock , working on a Defense Department-financed project called Arpanet ( Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ) , installed its first Interface Message Processor ( Imp ) and voila , computers began having intercourse with each other . Soon there were other developments to ease this communication , for instance , the development of Ethernet and LAN . Still , Professor Kleinrock 's work was seminal , and Bob Metcalfe ( the inventor of Ethernet , another key advance towards Internet ) has been congratulating Kleinrock on his parenthood and celebrating the Internet 's thirtieth birthday . So is the faculty at UCLA . So why should we not light the candles and celebrate a historic date in the emergence of Computer Civilization ? Moreover it is a fitting time to observe recent developments towards this era of Internet and to note the impending threats from Big Brother , and if she is elected in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the populace without warning , like the 1918 influenza epidemic or Political Correctness . Now in the last years of the twentieth century we have been overcome by this giddy enthusiasm for cyberspace . Its arrival is proclaimed everywhere with cheers for e-mail , e-commerce , E.coli  --  just kidding . The cheers resound even at the staid American Spectator , where we have auspicated a second magazine out there in cyberspace , The American Spectator Online ( www.spectator.org ) , complete with interactive correspondence and Ben Stein on-line . We are all cyberspace voyagers now ! <p> Unlike the epidemic of 1918 , the Computer Civilization is mostly for the good . In material terms the computer has dramatically improved lives . In intellectual terms it has rejuvenated the reputation of entrepreneurial capitalism . It probably accounts for about a third of the present economic boom . Consider only the digitalis it has given to productivity growth . This Computer Civilization unites and enriches the developed world . It arrived in stages going back centuries . Pascal devised a kind of Neanderthal computer in the seventeenth century . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computer . Charles Simonyi , one of the pioneers of the most recent stage in Computer Civilization , traces the digital computer back to the nineteenth century when Charles Babbage , the British mathematician , conjured up its theoretical outlines . Though Babbage had the principles right , he lived in the wrong century . What could power his computer ? Steam ? Perhaps a water wheel ? The digital computer had to await the development of electricity and a half dozen other technologies before the computer could achieve its present omnipresence . Now we have the Internet . <p> Curiously the intelligentsia has been uncharacteristically mum as Computer Civilization has expanded . In the 1950 's and 60 's the intelligentsia sounded an Orwellian alarm when the computer addressed us by our number rather than our name . But today with the computer serving us in home and office , the intelligentsia has fallen almost speechless . On the op-ed pages there will appear an occasional Naderite squawk of Luddite dread , but otherwise in their journals  --  say , in the Nation or the New York Review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over power struggles between the boys and the girls , perceived anemia among the flora and fauna , some local outbreak of the Ominous : the disappearance of hair from the head of Mrs. Mildred Smellytot several weeks after she bought her new cell phone , yellow spots on the Brussels sprout crop near Bull Snort , Georgia . Oh , yes , and a decade after the peaceful conclusion of the Cold War the intelligentsia is still discovering shocking evidence of collusion between the Pentagon and anti-Communist colonels  --  most recently , I believe , in Guatemala sometime in the 1970 's . Thank goodness , Tony Blair has Pinochet in custody ! Better it would be if the intelligentsia moved beyond the old obsessions ( about which they were usually in error  --  think of the Alger Hiss pother ) and gave fresh thought to the wonder and subversion of the microchip . <p> Libertarian conservatives have been ahead of the curve . Richard Rahn , the libertarian economist , writes in a timely new book , The End of Money and the Struggle for Financial Privacy ( Discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that within a few years many Americans will have largely given up cash for computer transfers of digital money and smart cards ( money on a microchip ) . The workers at the Internal Revenue Service will be thrown into despair . Perforce there will be a reduction in the involuntary taxation of financial capital , thus forcing a downsizing in government . The Clinton administration has glimpsed the future . Now the administration that so successfully implemented Filegate is boldly advancing policies to obliterate the citizenry 's private communications along the Internet . It opposes strong encryption of Internet communication on the grounds of national security and police surveillance of white-collar crime . Additionally it wants authority to monitor the Internet , again to protect us from harm . Though , as Rahn writes , such policing by the government will doom the era of digital finance with its promises of lower crime rates ( the citizenry will carry even less cash ) and continued low inflation , increased productivity , and still higher standards of living . <p> Rahn 's book provides a sense of Computer Civilization 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance Age of Computer Civilization so speedily arrived turn to Michael Hiltzik 's Dealers of Lightning ( HarperCollins , 448 pages , $26 ) . The spread of the microchip , personal computing , and the Internet do in fact constitute the rise of a historic epoch whose origins trace back to the early 1970 's when a small coterie of brilliant scientists was lured by the Xerox Corporation to a complex near Stanford University that would come to be known as Xerox PARC . Hiltzik provides the non-tech reader with at least a rudimentary sense of the equipment being developed in this period , though he never explains some of the reasons for its development . For instance , how was it that the tech wizards gathering at Xerox PARC could envisage such a wild leap from the bulky , limited computer of the 1960 's to the diverse computer technology of today ? Hiltzik almost makes these scientists appear as the adepts of science fiction . <p> Heroes of Dealers , such as Bob Taylor and Alan Kay , Metcalfe , Butler Lampson , Gary Starkweather , and Simonyi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1960 's into dozens of different computing machines , some mammoth , some small and personal , some for graphics , office transactions , scientific experiments , and entertainment  --  and all capable of communicating with each other and eventually the world . Thitherto the modern computer had been a huge block of wires and tubes about the size of an outhouse . The really powerful computers that cracked spy codes and guided inter-continental ballistic missiles were about the size of a roadside restroom along the side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and with as much charm . These ugly contraptions jiggled punch cards and made computations . But prior to Xerox PARC the computer was bereft of colorful screens , joyous speakers , floppy discs , and all the strangely piquant terminology the engineers dreamed up . <p> The behemoth computers of the past were used mainly by grim groups of scientists and bureaucrats . They had to schedule time on the machine . When time was up they withdrew while another group fed its boxes of punch cards into the monster . The practice was called " time-sharing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the era of " time-sharing " the machine came first and the human programmer second . The computer 's time was dear , say $300 per hour , while the programmers ' time was cheap , say $300 per week . The development of software has reversed the relationship . Now the money goes to the humans who spend it in the market , enriching society . <p> The pre-Xerox PARC computer could compute and store whole libraries of information . But an engineer named Gordon Moore somehow figured that computer power would grow ever cheaper and more portable . According to Moore 's Law , Hiltzik tells us , " computing power would exponentially increase in performance and diminish in cost over the years . Moore contended in 1965 that this trend could be predicted mathematically , so that memory costing $500,000 in 1965 would come all the way down to $3,000 by 1985 . " By 1998 the cost had dropped to a few hundred dollars . Apparently the trend will continue . This summer Science magazine reported that researchers from Hewlett-Packard and UCLA envisage a development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful as today 's . Americans wishing immortality will be able to swear off jogging and disgusting health foods by affixing a computer chip the size of a molecule to their vital organs . Like the microchips in our cars that notify us that we are in need of new brake pads , tomorrow 's molecular microchips will tell us when we are in need of , say , a new liver . <p> Xerox PARC witnessed the confluence of science and finance that characterizes today 's tech industry . Ebullient with a joie de science , thirty or so of the brightest technical minds in the country created such things as the personal computer ( a contraption called Alto ) , word processing , computer graphics , and the linkage of computers to other computers and peripheral equipment . Possessed of only a slippery grip on the value of the scientists ' work , Xerox 's businessmen bore the onerous burden of deciding if the work was marketable . Hiltzik tells the lively story of the scientists ' inventiveness . They were having a grand time . What they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier generation of scientists did with the Manhattan Project , though gratefully PARC 's work had more pervasive consequences for society . <p> Yet the business types from Xerox Corp . will always have to live down the judgment of later critics , such as Apple 's Steve Jobs , who believe the businessmen failed to capitalize on their scientists ' inventions . Upstart entrepreneurs took that work to market creating the present Renaissance in Computer Civilization . " The record is certainly damning , " writes Hiltzik . " Xerox had the Alto ; IBM launched the Personal Computer . Xerox had the graphical user interface with mouse , icons , and overlapping windows ; Apple and Microsoft launched Macintosh and Windows . Xerox invented **28;1075;TOOLONG word processing ; Microsoft brazenly turned it into Microsoft Word and conquered the office market . Xerox invented the Ethernet .... " <p> A glance at that list of inventions suggests Xerox PARC 's prodigious role in the present Computer Civilization . That the businessmen at corporate headquarters , making and mongering copying machines , did not grasp the value of their scientists ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esterhazy grasp the financial value of the masterworks once turned out so abundantly by his piano player , Franz Joseph Haydn ? PARC 's Metcalfe , with Ethernet and a claim to advances in the Internet among his credits , captures the ambivalence of the problem when he tells Hiltzik , " All of us who worked there enjoyed blaming Xerox for what went wrong .... But Xerox gave us the job . Why blame them ? So few of us accepted responsibility . " <p> Metcalfe figures in another interesting book on this the latest epoch of Computer Civilization : The Silicon Boys and Their Valley of Dreams by David A. Kaplan ( William Morrow , 350 pages , $27 ) . The joie de science shared by PARC 's tech wizards is now overshadowed , Kaplan writes , by the venture capitalists , big bucks deals , and opulent lifestyles . The personal fortunes amassed in Silicon Valley have fetched the headlines from the stupendous achievements of science . Consequently many of the tech wizards such as Metcalfe have vacated the Valley for the pleasures of continued intellectual strenuosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ongoing Renaissance and , who knows , perhaps recording the historic achievement of his generation . <p> Still the tech wizards ' achievement is continuing , and with it the attendant far-ranging changes in our society foreseen by the likes of Gilder and Rahn . E-commerce will change not only the way goods are purchased but conceivably the cityscape , as urban department stores , warehouses , and suburban malls are abandoned , leaving space for housing , restaurants , and other amenities . Digital finance 's wonders have already been suggested here by Rahn , but there will be more changes brought on by the Computer Civilization in medicine , education , and the arts . To filch a term from that long-defunct socialist critic , Michael Harrington , Computer Civilization is creating yet one more Other America . This is the America that accepts the freedoms and responsibilities availed to it by Computer Civilization . Its opposite is the America that wants to police the Internet and suppress the innovations of the tech wizards . My guess is that that megalomaniacal presidential candidate who claimed not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the suppressers . <p> The industrial age , powered by motors , brought wide-spread prosperity and individual liberty , Marx 's myopic critique be damned . Computer Civilization is bringing us more of the same . The scientists have developed the technology . The businessmen have marketed the stuff . The challenge over the next thirty years is to keep government 's tentacles off the progress . <p> By R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr <p> <p> R.
