DOES A PROTEIN STEER CANCER 'S COURSE ? <p> A truck rumbles slowly down a mountain road . Suddenly , its brakes go out and it starts to accelerate . A few minutes later , the driver loses control and the 18-wheeler flies off the edge of the bluff . <p> The runaway truck illustrates what happens to cells that lose the function of a gene that helps " brake , " or regulate , cell division . Rather than dividing in a slow , orderly fashion , these cells begin to divide faster and faster , eventually racing out of control . <p> What happens next ? Cancer . This deadly proliferation of abnormal cells eventually afflicts about one in three Americans , according to the American Cancer Society <p> Some cancer patients develop renegade tumors that do not respond to conventional treatment , notes Albert Deisseroth of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston . The trouble is , oncologists ca n't always identify such patients . <p> New research suggests that a wellknown braking gene , the retinoblastoma ( RB ) gene , plays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientists believe progression of the cancer is caused when the gene 's normal growth-regulating function is impaired or stopped . If confirmed , this finding might help researchers create a clinical test that would identify patients with very aggressive leukemia , bladder cancer and perhaps other malignancies as well . Armed with this information , oncologists could then provide such patients with the most powerful anticancer therapies available . " Now we have a marker for these renegade tumors , " Deisseroth says . <p> <p> The retinoblastoma gene is known to cause a ruthless eye cancer in children ( SN : 1/5/85 , p.10 ) . Oncologists began to notice that some survivors of this cancer went on to suffer unrelated cancers , such as bone and bladder cancers , later in life . This observation raised the possibility that problems with the RB gene might help explain some cancers that strike the general population . Indeed , subsequent research showed a link between the RB gene and a number of common adult cancers , including lung , breast , prostate , bladder and bone cancer . <p> These intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Medicine Center for Biotechnology in The Woodlands , Texas , to take a look at leukemia . People with leukemia , a cancer of certain white cells in the bloodstream and bone marrow , often experience fatigue and weight loss . The American Cancer Society estimates that the disease will strike 28,200 Americans in 1992 and kill 18,200 . <p> The Baylor-M.D . Anderson team focused on 43 men and women with acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , a particularly severe form of leukemia . Rather than test for the retinoblastoma gene directly the researchers looked for the telltale protein that cells produce when the gene is turned on . Scientists believe the RB protein is somehow involved in regulating cell growth . <p> The investigators discovered that 13 of the 43 patients ( 30 percent ) showed either abnormally low or no detectable levels of RB protein in their leukemic white blood cells . This suggests that problems with the RB gene are common for people with AML . <p> More important , when the researchers homed in on a subgroup of 20 newly diagnosed AML patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course and severity of their disease . <p> All 20 received the same regimen of anticancer drugs , yet some lived much longer than others . <p> For example , those whose blood cells showed little or no sign of the RB protein survived approximately 39 days from the time of diagnosis ; patients whose cells contained high concentrations of RB protein lived an average of 333 days . <p> AML patients with lots of RB protein still had a fighting chance against the disease , speculates study coauthor Steven M. Kornblau of M.D. Anderson . The test showed that they still had functional RB genes helping cells crank out the growth-regulating protein . <p> The RB test may one day flag leukemia patients who will soon take a turn for the worse , suggests Benedict . He described the new findings on March 31 at the American Cancer Society 's science writers ' seminar , held in St. Petersburg , Fla . The study will appear in an upcoming issue Of CANCER RESEARCH . <p> <p> The healthy human body relies on cell division to replace aging or dead cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amok . <p> How does it happen ? <p> Molecular biologists believe the process starts when radiation , a virus or a chemical carcinogen damages the cell . That injury may activate a gene , a sequence of DNA that tells the cell to manufacture a specific protein . Cancercausing genes , called oncogenes , can be involved at the genesis of a tumor . For example , the ras gene , when activated , may help cause colon and rectal cancer ( see sidebar ) . The RB gene , on the other hand , causes trouble when it is shut off . In adult cancers , the impairment of this gene may trigger the molecular events that cause an existing tumor to turn nasty , a process that eventually leads to metastasis - the spread of tiny cancer cells to distant parts of the body <p> Benedict believes another gene is responsible for setting off the process that causes leukemia . Later in the disease , something happens to inactivate the RB gene , he suggests . <p> Data from other studies provide some support for Benedict 's hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that the RB gene is involved in the progression of that disease . <p> Pathologist Carlos Cordon-Cardo of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City wanted to find a marker of a tumors behavior . His team turned to the RB gene and its protein product . <p> They searched for the retinoblastoma protein in frozen tumor samples obtained from men and women who were diagnosed with bladder cancer at some time during the past 10 years . The samples from 13 of the 38 patients with invasive cancer ( cancer that had spread from the lining of the bladder to the surrounding muscle ) had little or none of this crucial protein . All 38 had died of the disease . <p> When the researchers went back to check these patients ' medical records , they found that the 13 people with little or no RB protein fared worst . Those 13 survived only about a year after the biopsies were obtained , whereas the 25 people who had high levels of RB protein lived about eight years after diagnosis . <p> " We have observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature : ' Cordon-Cardo told SCIENCE NEWS . His team 's results have not yet been published . <p> Cordon-Cardo believes the RB gene is involved in a turning point - when bladder cancer changes from a relatively benign disease to one that spreads wildly and aggressively <p> Another study , this one led by Benedict and Christopher Logothetis of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , adds weight to that belief . Logothetis and Benedict studied 43 men and women with bladder cancer who had been treated with surgery and cell-killing chemotherapeutic drugs . The researchers wo n't release the details of the study , which has not yet been published ; however , Logothetis says that 37 percent of the patients showed altered RB functioning , as measured by the protein test . Those same individuals tended to deteriorate more quickly than people who showed high levels of RB protein in their tumor cells , he says . <p> Furthermore , the retinoblastoma test appeared as helpful as other indicators currently used to gauge disease severity , Logothetis says . Right now , pathologists look at a sliced section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that method is subject to error , notes Cordon-Cardo . He and others working with the RB protein test hope that it will provide oncologists with a more definitive marker of a rowdy tumor . <p> <p> Are tumors that lack the RB protein a nastier breed than tumors that retain this braking factor ? If scientists can prove they are , oncologists could begin to use the protein test to guide their treatment strategies . For example , about 20 percent of earlystage bladder cancer patients show no sign that they will deteriorate quickly , yet many die within a year , Logothetis says . At present , oncologists have no foolproof way of identifying these high-risk cases . <p> If the RB marker works , oncologists could spot patients who need more aggressive therapy In some early-stage bladder cancers , doctors remove the tumors but leave the bladder intact - an approach that works well for patients who have a slow-growing cancer . However , for patients on the verge of invasive disease , doctors could recommend removal of the entire bladder as well as chemotherapy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly says Kornblau , the RB test may identify people with leukemia who require all-out treatment to rout their cancer . Most patients with acute myelogenous leukemia initially receive anti-cancer drugs . Those who suffer a recurrence go on to receive a bone marrow transplant . <p> " One of the problems with AML is that you do n't know when to do a bone marrow transplant : ' Kornblau says . Because the high-risk patient may die before transplantation is considered , the RB test would be particularly useful in determining who needs such intensive treatment at the time of diagnosis , he says . <p> The link between the retinoblastoma gene and leukemia remains tentative , and preliminary results need confirmation before doctors can make use of the findings , cautions Benedict . On the other hand , many researchers have evidence suggesting that the RB test can predict the course of bladder cancer . Benedict believes a test for aggressive bladder cancer will be available within the year . <p> Researchers still do n't understand why the RB gene sometimes malfunctions . Has a toxic chemical or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular production of the RB protein ? Or does some other gene control the functioning of the RB gene ? <p> If future studies implicate a mutation in the RB gene , researchers might turn to gene therapy in their search for cancer cures . Genetic engineers would have to devise a method of inserting a healthy RB gene into malignant cells . Once activated , the healthy RB gene would instruct the cells to crank out the growth-regulating protein , curbing cancer 's spread , Deisseroth speculates . <p> " But that 's in the future : ' Deisseroth cautions . Like truck mechanics struggling to fix a faulty brake system , researchers must first identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the cancer . ' We have to find out what 's wrong , " he says , " before we can start to think about how to fix it . " <p> By KATHY A. FACKLEMANN <p>
