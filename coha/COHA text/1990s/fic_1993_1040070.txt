 | alone . Normally the loneliness here does n't bother me , but when I see someone falling victim to the winters , the dark , it becomes contagious , I feel it creeping in , and the only way to rectify it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Which is what I proceeded to try and do . It was one of those miraculous warm days we sometimes get here in February , the wind blowing in from the south to thaw the snow . I was leaving the motel office after talking to Linda when who did I see on the lawn but Nadia , hanging sheets to a line . There they were blowing out in the breeze , her skirt blowing out with them , the loose strands of her hair , and she was reaching up into it , really stretching , until everything , the sunshine itself , seemed to be streamed out in that one arcing curve . I watched her  --  oh , I do n't know . Half an hour maybe . There were lots of sheets and I was in no hurry , it was that beautiful a sight . Finally she got them all pinned up , reached down to pick up the empty basket , saw me . She started to say something  --  about that tiger stuff I suppose  --  but then our eyes sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and right away we were past the teasing stage . " I 'd like some water , " I said , my voice trembling so much it probably sounded like I was dying of thirst . " Water ? " She looked dazed , like she had n't expected that at all . Helpless , she finally pointed past the sheets . " Here , come . " We went back to the motel , the last room on the wing , the one she was still in the process of getting ready  --  she had unpinned her hair even before we got there . What I remember is that first moment of understanding  --  that border you tumble across when all the ordinary talk sud-  | denly takes on a deeper meaning , those glances are suddenly explained . There are other things I remember , too . Sitting on the bed drinking the water she brought me , her sitting next to me , the two of us facing each other , her eyes staring into mine with enough intensity to blow me all the way to Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to us from the window , sort of nudging us together even more , and her skirt riding up her thighs inch by inch . . . her moving slightly , a satin sound . . . and then knowing with a joy that warms me to this day there was nothing between us , absolutely nothing , and me , taking my time , barely breathing , still sitting , pressing in even further , like I was gently prying open a lilac bud , ever so gently , until  --  there , the petals opened . . . it was spring right there on that sheetless bed , the breeze holding us together , my ears filled with the sweetest sound a man can ever hope to hear this side of heaven . A while later , after we 'd changed the geography , she looked down at me , said something in Hungarian , cleaned the lint out of my navel with the same delicate plucking motion every woman I 've ever been with has used , then closed her eyes again , went back to moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We kept on that way nearly to dark . Getting dressed , I noticed a newspaper on the bureau near the cleaning supplies . Henry Cabot Lodge 's picture was on the front page  --  he 'd been making statements on the issues , shooting off his mouth in that typical Massachusetts way . Nadia reached around her back to fasten her bra , caught sight of the picture and smiled , turning the paper around so she could  --  well , flirt with it . I turned it upside down as an experiment . Sure enough , going past it to the mirror she made the same little smile , turned him  | right side up again . Three times we did that . She could n't have had any notion of who Lodge was , but there was something about that rugged face she could n't resist . It was early spring over in Franconia but late winter back at home . Lydia was sitting by the fire , clipping out pictures of cats from one of her women 's magazines . She would make up a scrapbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another on ponies . . . she kept the buttery full of them , pictures pressed away between soup cans . . . and yet every time I tried bringing a real pet home for her , she made me take it right back . She was another one who liked to keep her eyes to herself , not out of secrecy but punishing you . Still , this time she looked up , looked up briefly , her eyes widening just like a kid 's , their gray spreading into something lighter , and I remember thinking : Well , Ferris , there 's a hell of a lot of loneliness there , too . " Who was it this time ? " she asked , with no more interest than if we 'd been talking about logging . I went over to the stove , checked the damper . " It was Linda , was n't it ? Linda Wilberforce ? " " That 's been over for years , " I said , which was true . " It 's cold out  --  let me stoke this up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm better than any of them . " " Pardon ? " " I 'm better than any of them ! " That 's when I got my second or maybe third surprise of the day . Rather than starting in to yell like she sometimes did , or turning away silent like she did more often , Lydia came right over and grabbed me hard around the chest , started crying . You ever see flint cry ? That 's what it was like  --  so unexpected I could n't do anything but stare . She was hugging me for all she was worth , sobbing to the point of hiccoughs ,  | and yet all that only made me embarrassed for her , and then suddenly she pushed herself away , made a winding motion , slapped me as hard as she could across  --  well , it was meant to be my face , but it got my windpipe , left me choking . She had let me see her weakness , that was what she was mad about . I had seen it and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never going to be weak again . " Lyd ? " But there was nothing to say , nothing for either of us . She turned and hugged herself this time . It was like she had withered up right in front of me and wanted to press in the broken parts that remained . Next morning right on schedule up drives Max . He did n't dress for the North Pole like those other reporters . Here the weather had turned cold again , and he shows up wearing short sleeves like it was June . He 'd been brought up in Montana , the son of Welsh sheepherders who came over to work on a ranch , and I guess New Hampshire seemed downright balmy after the winters he knew there . He 's big , too  --  that 's the other thing you have to remember about Max . Oh , I want to say six seven , but he comes across as bigger than that . Wide shoulders , thick chest  --  by the time your eyes climb past those , there 's still a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . He slumps , which is odd in a man so self-assured , but I guess interviewing all those presidents and dictators and prime ministers , visiting all those wars , got so it weighed him down . His hair ? Sandy and curly , like a boy 's even then . In 1964 he would have been 45 , same as me . The wind out in Montana had reddened up his face , and there in the middle were his eyes which are the brightest , clearest blue I ever saw in a man . His uncle had been an ace in Flanders , shot  | down twenty-three Fokkers , and those are the kind of eyes Max has ; wherever they 're pointed toward is always a long way off . He did n't have the scar on his head he got later , reporting over in Vietnam after his friend LBJ betrayed him ; I always picture that scar , but it was n't there then . His expression was the same as it is now  --  sceptical and patient at the same time , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the second . It adds up to something that makes you want him to like you , so it 's no wonder he 's so good at what he 's good at . One glance at Max and people start to confess . Which I suppose is why I 'm thinking about him so much right now . But anyway , he showed up bright and early , paid his respects to Lydia , and then I walked him to my father 's old studio up in the high pasture past the pines . My father was a school teacher who was always preparing himself for something else . There was a slot cut in the roof so he could aim a telescope up toward the heavens , a peg on the wall where he could hang the navigating equipment he would need when he got around to building his sailboat , a music stand with a violin across it he was always intending to learn to play . Bookshelves , too  --  they ran every which way and were always full . In the old days even a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of Emerson and Parkman . The Dickens and Longfellow would be back down in the parlor , but the meatier fare was reserved for the studio . This included the complete leatherbound works of Eugene Debs ; my father , among other accomplishments , was the only Socialist in the top half of New Hampshire . At the time I 'm speaking of , the telescope was still there , but much to my shame the shelves were taken over by jigsaws and planes I had no place else to store . Still , it smelled like my father 's day , smelled of pine as if the boards  | had just been sawed . As in my father 's day  --  and the reason he sited the studio there  --  you could see down the meadow past the south ridge of Hogback toward the horizon in Vermont thirty miles away . Then as now it 's the only place in the Notch that has a clear view out , and toward March my father would spend all night there , studying and staring , thinking and tinkering , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in . I sat him down on the old parson 's bench that ran under the window , then got the petroleum stove going to brew up some coffee . At first it was the usual kind of talk that 's exchanged between two friends who have n't seen each other in four years . I asked him how Anya was . Busy with her usual research , he said ; her name seemed to make his eyes go even more distant , so I did n't probe . What we talked about mostly , at least until that first shyness wore off , was the old Culbertson farm down on the south side of the Notch road . He and Anya were living in Washington year around , and they badly needed a summer place where both of them could write , Max on politics , Anya on oceans . So as I say , it was a while before we got around to the subject . Me , I was listening to him as attentively as I could , but I kept thinking of Nadia , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for me right now over in her motel . " Well , " I said at last . " I ca n't see how that Pulitzer Prize business changed you , at least not your looks . " He laughed , and the awkwardness I 'd felt between us vanished in a flash . " Hell , they had to give it to someone , " he said . But the funny thing is it had changed him , or something had . There were a lot more lines in his forehead than I remembered from four years ago . I did n't know him as well as I do now , but I knew enough to see he had that sad .  | tragic vision of life a lot of thinkers have  --  the instinct that life , no matter what you make of it , will always break you in the end . . . and that 's not the kind of thing you can keep off your face forever . He took another sip of coffee , then pointed his yellow pad at me to let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , in that cowboy baritone of his . " Who 's it going to be ? " " Johnson , " I said , quicker than that . He threw his hands up in disgust . " I flew all the way to New Hampshire for this ? Of course it 's going to be Johnson . You do n't have to be a sage to predict Johnson . " " Oh , sage now is it ? " " That 's what I hear . The networks have found you , reporters moving in on my territory . Actually , I 'm of two minds about that . For ten years now my editors have always assumed I made you up . " I suppose I was his invention , come to that . He had found me first in ' 52 , written that column ending As Ferris goes , so goes the nation that made us both famous . He 'd been coming back every primary season since , sort of checking in on the state of the union , or at least this small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every winner right . But this was 1964 ? it was rougher than ever . " Johnson eh ? " I said , turning the tables on him while I thought . " What makes you like Johnson so much ? " Max shrugged . " He 's a bastard , there 's no doubt about that . But he 's the kind of bastard that can work for good if he gets the right advice . He 'll clean out Kennedy 's men , then things will start happening . " " What about Vietnam ? " I asked . In those days the word seemed awkward on your tongue . He shrugged again . " He 's not that stupid . He 's got to look over his shoulder toward the right for a while longer ,  | that 's all . I spent an hour with him last week and he stressed that again and again . Ten days after the election the troops will be home . But you 're stalling and I know it . Who 's going to win the Republicans ? " Even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times running , that 's still no help to you on the fourth . It 's hard to explain in words , but mostly I let my thoughts float around random , sort of tossing the candidates up there in the brain , the way they look , what they say , how close they match the pattern of man we like up here , and then usually three or four names just fall away of their own weight and there 's only two left . Now I concentrate a little harder , weigh them like scales are balanced on a beam across my head . Almost anything can tip the balance . A hunch , an intuition , something they said  --  but mostly hunch . " What about Goldwater ? " Max asked , when the silence went on . " Most conservative candidate in a conservative state . Defense , too . That will carry the shipyard workers over in Portsmouth . Hates unions , but the union vote here is negligible . " I told him what happened with the television people and he laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing me out . " He 's been close before , a proven vote getter . Anyone who can run New York should be able to run the country . Every poll has him leading . " I told him about Rockefeller 's visit ; he laughed and wrote the story down on his pad . While all this was going on the three candidates were still tossing around pretty near equal in my head ; none of them rose naturally to the top . The window was open to let out the stove smoke , and just then came a little breeze edging in backwards , not cold like you might expect  | from the cloudiness , but spring-like , warm , fragrant even , nudging . . . and just like that two of them stopped tossing and sank away , one stayed up there , the one who had a face strong enough to fascinate Nadia , a woman who did n't let herself get fascinated easy . Max sat there with his pencil , waiting . . . waiting . . . " Henry Cabot Lodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lodge by twelve percentage points , maybe more . " There was a flicker , just a flicker of surprise across Max 's face , but he immediately erased it ; you 're sitting there watching a magician strut his stuff , you try and look respectful . But still , to Max it was n't magic , not quite , and now that I had come out with it he wanted to know why . " Lodge ? " he said , giving me one last chance to change my mind . " Well , okay . Famous family , senator from neighboring state . Good war record . A firm stance in the middle . Lodge ? Good for you , Ferris . I think you might be right once again . " How could I tell him it had nothing to do with any of those logical things ? The man was making his fame and fortune thinking it did . It 's funny , our being the same age . At moments like that I felt fifty years older . " Yep , Lodge , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that business is out of the way . We 're going down to the Culbertson farm on my tractor and I 'm going to show you what a pretty summer place it would make all fixed up . " A week later his column came out with my prediction . Max being Max , the reasons he gave were a bit more elaborate than what I told him . Still , a lot of people were waiting for it , just like they 're waiting for it now . I 'd been right so many times it got so it was n't just a prediction anymore , but something that actually swayed people , so it was no surprise when Lodge won the primary by twelve percentage points right on the nose . I was right in ' 64 . I was right in  | ' 52 and ' 56 and ' 60 and ' 68 and ' 72 and ' 76 and ' 80 and ' 84 and ' 88 and ' 92 and I 'll be right this year , soon as I make up my mind . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These new presidentialites are a different breed than the old ones . They 've learned to disguise what 's inside . What 's outside , well it 's hardly up to them , the tabloids and television make up what the outside is . Boom , this one is a lecher ; boom , this one is a crook ; boom , this one is saintly , let 's get a book going about his wife and dog . When Max comes it will all be clear . Until then it hardly bears thinking about . A or B or Y or Z , and as for balancing them I ca n't even get them to squat on the scales . I 've been having trouble ever since Lydia died . I wo n't start praising her  --  we had our scraps , but she knew even more about this part of the world than I do , was a walking almanac of who was kin to whom and what catastrophes happened when , and yet despite these ties she was one of the only two women I could n't erase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But without her . . . well , there 's an echo in the house . Lived here all my life and never noticed the echo until she was gone , and it gets into my ears and confuses me , so it 's no wonder I ca n't think . But still , the primary is two weeks away now and Max has n't even called . Of course he 's taking Anya 's death hard . He does n't write columns twice a week like he used to but only now and then when something special warrants . But I 've always marked it down on the calendar , just like I do the first redwing blackbird , and this is the latest he 's ever come . His back 's been troubling him probably . All they have up here are little commuter jets , so maybe he does n't feel up to squeezing himself in . You 'd think the paper could send him up in a limousine . Surely someone like Max  | they 'd be happy to . As I say , he 's usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column is written . You get so you hate to see anything change . You long for it all your life . . . want your wife to change , want the weather to change , want the country to change . . . then you get here to our age and you do n't want anything to change . Some things do n't change . New Hampshire 's primary comes first every election year , and we can hardly figure out why the rest of the country bothers to vote after us . The only time we 're wrong is when some slick politician from Massachusetts charms us out of our senses . Three out of four years nobody even knows where we 're located , but that fourth year  --  there we are smack dead center in the world 's attention . Crankiest state in the union , New Hampshire is . Home to more dedicated misanthropes than any place you could name . Downright loonies , too . We used to have the most institutionalized per capita of any state , until they got embarrassed by that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Our biggest source of revenue is liquor sales . We plant official state liquor stores on either side of the interstate , and send our kids to school by getting New Yorkers drunk coming and going . Wife beating , too . Around here they consider it remarkable if you say of a man , a really bad man , " Well , at least he do n't hit his wife ! " And there 's an incest problem , one we just ca n't shake . All that isolation . Used to be the isolation of the woods , now it 's the isolation of TV , people staying indoors , but isolation is isolation and there 's terrible things that go on . Sad things , too . Marshall and Nancy Palmer right up the road , brother and sister . They were both homely , neither was educated , their folks died , they were alone on the farm , there was no one to love and so they loved each other , but then some social worker got to them , told them it  | was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cord , Marshall up in the barn with rope , and I was the one who found them and cut them down . There 's lots more of course , good and bad , and there are foggy days when I swear the entire state seems heaped on my head . I know it goddammit well enough . I 've logged it and farmed it and soldiered in it and caroused in it and hiked it and fished it and even bummed around it back in the ' 30s when the freight trains still ran  --  and washed my hands of it , vowed a hundred times to leave and always came right back again the moment I hit the border . Sometimes it appears to me in square crooked bits , like a puzzle tossed haphazard across the floor , but other times I can see the whole thing assembled like I was high up looking down , the green taking on motion , becoming forest , the white starting to run , shining like snow melt , the blue spreading about . That little pond where it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut Lake , source of the river , a beaver pond hardly wider than its name . The forty-foot swatch that 's cut through the tamarack along the border , Quebec on one side , New Hampshire on the other  --  a swatch the customs men cleared to halt bootleggers and draft dodgers and other well-intentioned folk . My friend Johnny Temple and I used to chase partridge along it , emigrate and immigrate with each step , and one time I even had a French girl there , Annette Pelletier , and I arranged it so we were kissing in Canada , screwing in America , and I never had a more liberating experience in my life . Lake Francis comes next , good salmon water , and then the town of Pittsburg where the people are all woods queer , there are more moose than people , and the moose are crazy , too  --  they spend summer evenings staring at each other , people at moose , moose at people , God knows what they see . It used to be an independent country , the Indian Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own currency , its own crooks hiding from justice , and then the day they finally settled all the boundaries a reporter was sent by the Boston papers to interview the inhabitants , and he found one Vermont farmer who , when the reporter told him the boundary line had been redrawn and he now lived in New Hampshire , thought it over for a minute , then said : " Well young fella , I 'm mightily glad to hear it . Could n't have stood another one of those Vermont winters ! " . . . And the Connecticut River gets a little wider here , swollen by Hall 's Stream and Perry 's Stream , too ; there 's that rock pool above North Strafford behind the old bordello where I caught a twelve-pound brown trout during a rainstorm so fierce it took out three bridges in Coos County alone . Then there 's Groveton where the paper mills make the air smell like turnip syrup , and the diners are full of old men talking back and forth in Quebecois , waited upon by sixteen-yearolds who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the land slopes higher comes Stark , set like a toy village at the base of Devil 's Slide , with the worn impressions left in the meadow from the barracks that used to stand there when it was a prisoner-of-war camp  --  the barracks I guarded when I was a soldier , guarding Hans among others , the man I killed . Stark 's a tough one , I have to blink fast to clear my eyes of Stark , the balloon I 'm riding always sinks , and yet while I 'm up there I glance over at Berlin , the smokestacks , the grayness , and sadness of a mill town at the end of nowhere . But just when I start to despair comes the White Mountains , best thing in the state . Real mountains , people sneer at their elevation , but try climbing one in a September blizzard when the fog is so thick you ca n't see two feet in front of you and the wind blows down from the Pole with nothing to stop it except whatever miserable thin stuff you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington that lists how many people have died there over the years , and it 's a long list , and yet the view up top when the fog clears is enough to make you fall on your knees in wonder , the ocean in the distance , the mountains spread all around , mountains named after Adams and Madison and Jefferson , real presidents , the summit cones with white-silver rocks on top , so in the old days people in the valley thought they were capped with diamonds , only they did n't call them diamonds but carbuncles . And there 's not one of those mountains I have n't stood on , looked down from , the way I 'm looking down now , and yet when I stare up at them from the valley it hardly seems possible , they 're so remote looking , so untouchable . And then the mountains give way a bit , but not before Moosilauke , handsomest of them all far as I 'm concerned , especially in autumn when the leaves turn scarlet . . . The state widening here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side , Maine on the other , but never quite losing its distinction . There 's Haverhill in the west , pretty town , Greek Revival all over the place , and then Hanover of course , with the rich college kids ; last time I was there was when Max received his honorary degree , told all those graduates right to their faces that America was headed the wrong way , sliding into greed and selfishness and indifference  --  and an afternoon at Dartmouth College in Hanover was more than enough for me , thank you . Then going back east a little to all the big lakes  --  lakes with such pretty names I used to name my horses after them back in the days we used teams in the woods , I 'd hitch up old Sunapee and swaybacked Ossipee and sunny Mascoma and stubborn Umbagog and Winnipesaukee , biggest and strongest of all . Oh how I loved to say those names out loud ! And then southeast of the lakes the land starts flattening out , sloping down to Portsmouth , famous port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're all sick with asbestos poisoning , darkens their skin , so you can walk there in the afternoon and see hundreds of broken men , broken women , and one of them , for all I know , is my son Jordan , at least that 's where I saw him last twelve years ago on the second worst night of my life . And out in the ocean off Portsmouth are the Isles of Shoals , like pies dropped on the sea from cows that ate too many rocks , then what crowded little seacost we have , a dozen miles worth . And then back the other way again and . . . well , there 's not much left worth talking about . Land-wise there 's a lot left , the triangle broadens the further south you travel , but as far as real things , precious little . There 's Concord , state capital , where our legislature likes to debate the important issues , for instance changing our state motto into something less bloodthirsty , something that would attract tourists to the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire ! And there 's Derry , which is suburbs now , but used to be country enough to give Robert Frost his poems ; Manchester where Ed Muskie had his crying spell that cost him the presidency ; Nashua where the mills that once gave jobs to people have been fancied up into shops selling trinkets no one needs and no one can afford  --  Nashua where my father took me as a boy to hear Big Bill Heywood address the Wobblies , pressed me right through all the reaching hands so that stocky , pockmarked man could rub my hair in a kind of blessing . And there 's lots of things in this state I 'm not even mentioning , and not just postcard things . There 's lonely , awkward men who ca n't find a woman no matter how hard they try , and women trying to work and raise three kids all by themselves , and people , working people , walking around with puzzled looks on their faces , wondering Where 'd  | my job go ? Where 'd my pride go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago seemed so solid in my hands ? . . . and families living in foundation holes covered with tarpaper , perishing in fires from trying to stay warm , and families who do n't even have that , and none of this is easy to look at , but I make myself , you can focus as far back from earth as you want to but you ca n't focus so far back that the pain disappears . And then like I say it 's all surburbs and offices and malls , empty ones built during the boom years then abandoned once things got tough , so you wonder why they cut the trees down in the first place . But it will get busy again , the tax evaders and the easymoney men will move north from Massachusetts just the way they 've moved north ever since this state began . I hardly know what to make of that whole lower third , it 's changed so much from when I was younger . Changed , so even from high up it 's all a blur of ugliness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try looking down on it the way I did those other places , it 's still a blur and a fog and a great lookalike nothing that extends , I 'm told , all the way to Florida . I see it all just like I see my legs , my torso , my chest , so it 's no wonder people come to me when they want to know what this cranky Godforsaken beautiful terrible land is thinking . But . . . ah , the hell with it . The hell with it all ! I wish I could find a place I did n't know before , so the changing would n't bother me  --  a place with no before , only after . There is one place that does n't change . When my anger cools I remember there is such a place . Out through the mud room , across the gravel that leads to the barn , through the barn past the empty stalls to the back door , up through the orchard across the plank bridge Jordan helped me put in before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump  | Herberts and tart Jerseys , bare now , their buds tight with promise . . . up through the meadow , my breath forming a little cloud in front of me , my gumboots crunching on the snow crust . My father was a clever man . Not only did he put his studio in the only spot where you can see out of the Notch , it 's the only place you can get an undisturbed view of the heavens , see the horizon on all sides  --  see Orion rise in the winter sky , see the long line of Andromeda , the wide square of Pegasus , my friends that are the faithful ones , the ones that parade across the sky and gladden the heart and never change . I 'm there right now . The older I get , the more time I spend watching them all . I ca n't sleep and it 's better than staying down there in bed , tossing and turning , going over history wishing I 'd done things different . Stars do n't change . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star that shines alone in the fall . . . not that it makes any difference what star you were born under . It 's what stars you loved under , which ones you hated under , the ones you camped under and stared at and lost yourself in looking at . Here in February they 're as bright as they ever get . Orion of course , the hunter 's sword a smear in my seeing , but there was a time when I could pick out every star . Higher toward the west is the V of Taurus and the foggy Pleiades that even now I ca n't look at without feeling sad , though I ca n't explain why . If I bring my head back quick there 's Capella right straight overhead , bright Capella , and that cheers me up enough so I can move over to the twins , Castor and Pollux . . . and past Gemini is Cancer and the triangle of Leo , and then wait long enough there peeking slowly over the horizon in the northeast will be Arcturus , yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one star in the heavens Anya knew and watched for and cherished .

It occurred to me this morning that all the times Max 's visited I 've never taken him up here at night , shared all this glory , and that 's what I plan to do this time . But then , thinking about him again , I get feeling confused , lonely . What 's wrong ? Why does n't he call ? Why does n't he come ? Midnight . The deep sound of the church bell over in Dixford eight miles away , and then , before it 's finished , the last brassy strokes of the bell in Carlton three miles further .

Come while I still have the courage to tell you what has to be told .  | The letters he found in her room , all but one of them , were of celebration and praise . They were from strangers mostly , those who saw her on television and others who had read her books . Dear Anya Thomas , most began ( there was no resisting that first name ) . Thank you for writing of the sea so movingly , thank you for your erudition and passion , thank you for warning us so clearly of the dangers that threaten us  --  thank you Anya Thomas for the inspiration of your life and work . Few were from professional oceanographers . Those remained in her lab over in Woods Hole  --  the poorly equipped , cramped lab that seemed to symbolize how uncomfortable she had always been in that world . A maverick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in establishment eyes on many counts , and it was to her credit that she had abandoned them as hopeless a good ten years before they abandoned her . He would have to straighten those letters too , in time . For now he was spending long afternoons in her study  | above the porch , going through the bundles she had managed to arrange with rubber bands in the agonized months before her death . The need to organize , strip clean , scrub away , scour . Apparently this was characteristic of her type of cancer , and it extended past the letters to the room itself . She had ordered the paint to be stripped off the walls , the wood sanded back until it shone like driftwood bleached in the sun . Curtains torn down , the panes of glass enlarged , windows thrown open even when it was cold ? and then the plucking at the clothes , the impatience with any kind of covering , the tortured details he could n't bring himself to remember even now . There was no escaping . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her those last three years , he understood this urge perfectly , since he shared it himself . Selling the house in Washington , retiring the column , moving year-round to the Cape . It was all part of the same need , to have nothing inessential between you and whatever fate had in store . He reached again into the cardboard box , stirred his hand through the mass of envelopes , pulled one out . This was from a young girl , the handwriting exaggerated and round , the message simple . I saw your show on plankton , the girl wrote . It was beautiful , the way you described it , the mystery of it all . It 's pretty scary to think it 's disappearing like that , but maybe you can fix it up ? I hope so . Thank you Anya Thomas so much . He took out five more , read them quickly , sorted them into the proper bundles , started on another  --  and then suddenly , impatiently , threw the envelopes down and went over to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn toward Nauset Bay . It was white in the late winter sun , the combers unrolling from an ocean that was whiter  | yet , creased with shadows from the long wisps of cloud . Watching this , his impatience disappeared , or at least shifted direction . On that kind of afternoon the clouds could go either way , widening out until they cleared , or joining edges and thickening into a squall , and he badly needed to get in a walk before having his talk with Marcia , a walk long enough that the mess inside him would settle a bit , let him think . He had never been on the Cape in February , not in all the years they had owned the house . He used it like the whaling captain who had originally built it , as a place of refuge at his back , to be visited only occasionally , held in reserve for a time when his questing should be over . Anya was the one who took care of it , invested her love . For two months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every minute , and then late in the winter she would retreat here , go back to her work . He always planned on arriving in May , spending the summer , but then would come another crisis , a fresh war , a new leader to interview or a repentant old one to speak with before he died , and the rendezvous they planned so carefully would be delayed again and again , so he was lucky to spend a month on the Cape , then out he would go again after his own particular species of whale . One day their lives would converge in a better pattern . It was an article of faith for both of them right up until the end . He stepped back from the window , slowly rubbed his eyes , then stepped forward again , this time with his face against the glass . Through some trick of acoustics , with the draft that came through the sash , he could hear quite clearly Marcia 's voice on the patio thirty yards away . That corner of lawn was sheltered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken Devon there , his grandson . She  | was coaxing him to talk , patiently at first , repeating the same word over and over . . . Birdy , Devon . Birdy . Birdy . Bir-dee . . . but then , as always against his silence , her voice became too eager , too loud , and he retreated from the window , unwilling to hear more . He put in another hard hour on Anya 's letters , reading them just far enough to find out what category they fell in , banding them accordingly , stacking them in years . In some respects it was like counting votes  --  enough praise , and truth would be overruled  --  but it was much more serious than that , too , and at the heart of his tidiness was an overpowering need to protect her reputation , preserve it under a sealant of approbation where it could suffer no harm . And that was odd in its way , since all the time they had been together he had never felt the urge to shelter her , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through the letters , remembering what Marcia had said , knowing how savagely the media could turn on one of its darlings , he felt as protective as a man with a young wife on their wedding night , so that he wanted to put his arm around her memory , pull it close to his side , keep it there in what feeble safety it commanded while the wind rattled the windowpanes , the hail beat down . Overpowering  --  there was no other word possible . Not for the first time he thought about putting her in his farewell column , the one Simon was dunning him for so continually . It was sentimental of him ( he would not indulge in sentiment , even now ) , but he had always had the feeling that by putting people in his column , even mentioning them briefly , he was protecting them from harm . Not physical harm . . . Kennedy was in his column often enough , Luther King , Anwar Sadat . . . but remembrance harm . By a few carefully chosen phrases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life that for good or evil had left no impression at all . It might make a column at that  --  reputation , the dirty tricks time played with it . God knows he was in need of something . For forty years he had taken every thought that occurred to him and examined it for possible inclusion in a column , and here at the end the criteria seemed stricter than ever , so hardly any ideas made the cut . But no , he would not write of Anya , not even in her defense . What he had thought of writing about , thought about more seriously , was her family , and how , in their passing , they illustrated so much that was essential in the American charac-ter . He was sure of his theme , vaguer on how to present it . They were a varied enough bunch . Beginning with English dissenters on both sides , one branch , moving to Virginia , had experienced no problem in changing over to a fierce defense of the prevailing orthodoxy , while the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward orthodoxy of any kind , the two passions meeting eventually in that most American of neutral grounds : the pursuit of lucre , and the power and saintliness it con-veyed . There was a great-grandfather who built clipper ships , another who grew cotton ; a relative who commanded a regiment on the Union right at Antietam and did well on the first day when so many others turned and ran ; another relative , this one a major with Longstreet , who kept a diary during the war that was readable to this day . Her maternal grandfather built railroads across the Southwest , specializing in the hardest kind of engineering , the toughest routes ; her paternal grandfather , old man Robbins , left New England just in time , before the arteries hardened and the region went stale , opening the first commercial nursery in  | Indiana , prospering so mightily that he served two terms as governor and had the agricultural college at the university named in his honor . Her mother 's side of the family remained in the South . Her mother , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alabama ; one of her friends was Zelda Fitzgerald , and of the two beauties most people would have predicted the brighter , more splendid future for Cireen . She married well ( the arborist 's son , Henry , a captain at nineteen and the youngest member of Pershing 's staff ) , but , after the excitement of war gave way to the madness of the ' 20s , both lost their way . Cireen , her passion for art racing dangerously ahead of her abilities , was in an asylum well before the Crash . Henry , dissenting in the only manner left in a family of achievers , drank his abilities away shotglass of rye by shotglass of rye . Anya was brought up by maiden aunts in a damp mansion on Long Island , seeing her parents only occasionally . In one of the few moments of self-pity she ever permitted herself , she described to him how she had begged Cireen and Henry for their love , literally begged them  --  once , in a desperate scene , and then never again . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the family 's justification finally lay . With her they had managed to make the hardest of American transitions , the leap from a life of materialism to a life of the mind . He 'd like to write something on that , since if anything the transformation was even harder to make today . A column , certainly , but his last one ? There was too much that was elegiac about the occasion to add any deepening of the note , and yet that 's where he was now , there was no disguising it . Anya 's death , the passing away of the America he felt he had at least the potential to understand , the century ending . Elegy was in the air , the bittersweet  | temptation , but he 'd be damned if he 'd given in to it without a fight . No , he would look to the future for his final column . The wheels would have to start spinning again , this time in a different direction . But not now . The sunlight , high up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned softer , and he knew he would have to hurry if he wanted his walk . There was much in that softness to recall November  --  the afternoons when he had taken over from the nurse , sat there alone with Anya until dark , doing what he could to help her through the pain . Holding her hand , bathing her face . Little enough in forty years . But he would n't think about that now either . He had made it downstairs to the hall , had managed to take his duffle coat from its peg in the stairway , when the phone rang , stopping him in his tracks . Two times , three times . He reached for it , hesitated , then heard Marcia pick up the extension in the kitchen . " Simon , " she said brightly . " Still fine thanks . Why yes , he was just a minute ago . Let me check . " When she peeked around the wall he shook his head at her , pointed emphatically toward the door . She frowned , put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just missed him again . He 's out on his constitutional . Can I give him a message ? " He could n't let Marcia do his dirty work forever . He waited by the window , trying to peek out under the overhang of roof to the clouds . " That was Simon , " she said , coming back . " For the fourth time since noon . He wants you to call him at home at your convenience . " She said it with her head tilted to the side , the red hair he loved so much spilling off her forehead , her tone managing to be curious and challenging at the same time ; it  | was the way she had met every new departure in his behavior ever since she was a girl . He could n't help but smile , seeing that . As usual on the Cape , she was dressed all in denim , and it seemed to relax her face somehow , making her look younger than she did dressed for busi-ness . " About my column probably , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deadlines . " This did n't satisfy her  --  if anything , her head tilted even more . " He 's like Max Thomas . He takes them seriously . " He smiled again . " Never missed one in my life . Is n't that what I 'm supposed to say ? I 've missed hundreds . I lead the world in missed deadlines . " " That 's not what you used to tell me when I was late with my homework . Never mind . We all have our little mysteries . Have a nice walk . But save time for me later , okay ? You promised me we 'd have that talk . " He was almost to the door when he saw a blue shape hunch itself lower to the floor in the parlor . Devon , wrapped in a blanket  --  he had n't noticed him before . He sat in the shifting light of the television , head craned back , chin thrust forward like someone getting a tan . As usual , he had turned the sound off ; at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive distaste for words from any source . Marcia worried about that , of course . Though Max had n't asked , he believed specialists had already been called in . He was a handsome enough kid . Compact , speedy legged , with blonde hair and eyes like the fated Henry 's  --  so large and brown they could always get him out of trouble . But that was something else he did n't do : get in trouble . He ate what was put in front of him , did as his mother instructed , sat motionless for hours watching the tube . He had his eyes closed now ; he pulled the blanket around him like the flaps of a tent . Because he had seen him ? Max  | would have liked to ask him to come along on the walk , but as usual he felt shy before his grandson , clumsy , and opening the door quietly he went out alone . It was a fine afternoon , brighter than it looked from inside , with the sun hanging noticeably higher in the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house the wind blew in swirls , but once clear of it the gusts came straight down from the north , and he had to plunge his hands in his pockets to keep warm . Their meadow dropped seaward in a broad slide , ending at the sandy cliff that fronted the ocean all the way to Provincetown . There a man may stand and put all America behind him , Thoreau had said of it , facing east . Three thousand miles away was Portugal , with no land in between , not even an islet , nothing to interfere with the wide cleansing sweep of that image . He was a fast walker , determined  --  he had been raised by people who believed stride was one of the few appropriate ways to express your character . That was out in Montana , in a West so distant in time and space it could have been an entirely different planet , and yet he thought about it often , compared it to the landscape he lived in now . There were similarities  --  it was the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The breadth of horizon , the weather coming from a long way off , the way the beach grass mimicked sage . But in the West you could n't look at the landscape without sensing some challenge in it , potential , the curse of possibility . Possibility for what ? Well , he had never answered that , certainly not as a boy , and the ones who had , the wildcat speculators , the water barons , the ranchers who were so sure they had a higher purpose for the prairies than the Indians they displaced , he had hated like he hated few other men . There was possibility in the ocean , too , but at least here it seemed more personal than with mountains or plains  | a man did n't look out toward the breakers and think of empire . And with the sea , at least its surface , man had worked out a rough kind of truce , hardly asking it to do more now than support the occasional lonely freighter that steamed between decaying ports . As Anya had spent the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story with the inner sea . . . there was bad news there , equal to or worse than anything happening out West . . . but , at least on days like this one , a man could still look out across the blue sheen of it and feel a tremendous surge of liberation . He walked along the cliff , then went down a gully and slid a half mile further on the sand itself . It was hardpacked in the shadows , still caught up in winter , but out by the tide line it was grainier , brighter , covered with the same scallop of foam that coated it in summer . Once not far from here , just after a storm , he had come across the wreckage of an old schooner , her white ribs swelling out from the broken cliff like the skeleton of a prehistoric bird . He went back to fetch Anya  --  and in the hour he was gone , the shifting sand had covered it up again , leaving no trace . He had gotten into the habit of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good view out to sea , and he took a certain amount of solace in merely sitting atop anything so old . A good spot , maybe too good a spot , to sit and brood . The introspective quality of the sea he had always used to his advantage . Statesmen loved nothing better than to walk along the sand with a columnist in attendance , hands clasped behind their backs , heads bowed at an appropriately thoughtful angle , a photographer trailing along at a discreet distance to capture their silhouettes in a lonely black and white . It was Thomas 's first rule of interviewing : the more weighty the powerful felt , the more copiously the powerful talked  --  and there was nothing as weighty or  | thought-provoking as breaking surf . He had walked with De Gaulle on the beaches of Brittany , with Churchill along the Cap D'Antibes , Khrushchev on the pebbly beaches of the Black Sea coast , Kennedy at Hyannisport  --  beneath a parasol with Indira Gandhi along the Bay of Bengal , with Nyerere of Tanzania on the broad white beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand of Utah Beach , the General talking  --  not about the war , not about the great themes such a setting conjured up  --  but about a bridge hand he had been dealt the night before the invasion , and how one of his most trusted aides had been caught redhanded cheating . But then he was always being disappointed in Ike . One of his favorite column ideas was to imagine a great moment in history that had never happened but should have . Reagan visiting a dying AIDS patient , nursing him with his own hands . Ford getting on television to announce that no one was above the law , no matter what their position , and so there would be no pardons for Nixon or the other Watergate crooks . With Eisenhower , he had written a column picturing him going to Little Rock in person to take the black girl 's hand and leading her past the police and segregationists into school , thereby doing more toward easing racial hatred in one gesture than anything his successors had done since . He closed his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names came , their faces , too , even a particular way they squinted at the sun  --  but what they said , the insight they provided , all this was lost . How many great men he had known ! How much they had talked ! What little wisdom ! It was something he was thinking about a great deal recently  --  wisdom , what exactly the word meant . Here for forty years he had been paid to provide his share , five days  | a week in the early years , twice-weekly in the recent ones , and yet no one expected more than a dollop each time , a quick insight , a fresh perspective , nothing greater . In his last column it would be different  --  people expected him to come across with the accumulated wisdom such a career had surely brought . And certainly , if he examined his own motives , he was more than happy to provide what he had . But where , in the jumble of his knowing , did such wisdom lie ? He was helpless in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his last column the secret would be revealed . The wind increased now , spinning up little whirlwinds of sand that broke apart on his boots . Time to head back , he told himself . But even when the sun began going down in the red sky behind him he remained where he was , staring out to sea , trying to come to terms with his overpowering need to come to terms . Anya had wisdom . It was not the least of the ironies of their marriage that Anya had always possessed more wisdom than he , even if Marcia was right about what she had done . To walk with her on the beach was to learn more in one hour than any number of walks with the great could provide . She knew the sea , not just in theory but as a familiar presence that had been her companion since those lonely childhood days on Long Island , when , for lack of anyone else , she turned the sea urchins and starfish and other creatures of the tide line into her friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this before she was twelve . Here , she would say to him , holding up a handful of sand . Look at this . Here , she would say , kneeling by the surf , scooping up a handful of water . Here , look at this . She was a good beachcomber , a lucky one  --  things seemed to float deliberately to her feet . Lobster traps , fish  | boxes off Portuguese trawlers , a Madeira bottle that had drifted all the way from Spain ; once , in a marvelous joke , a Rolex watch still watertight in its carton . Animals and birds , too  --  it was as if she called to them with a secret whistle . All you became aware of when you walked the beach with her was abundance . . . of how , when you looked at things with her focus , creation was not an abstract concept , not something that had happened in the past , but an ongoing act so powerful the very sand was buoyed up by it , bursting with life . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the sea as well . When she dipped her hand into its edge , held the small cupful before him , it was plankton she wanted him to see , or at least the filmy trace left by its abundance . It was her specialty  --  copepods , the zooplankton which in numbers was the most abundant animal in the ocean . She spent many hours trying to impress upon him these numbers ( 5,000 in that small cupful ) , but it was like listening to an astronomer explain the vastness of time and space . Well , there were an unimaginable number of copepods swimming about , he was prepared to accept that , even if he could make no real sense of the scale . But things were n't so fine with the copepods after all ; the copepods , she announced in her famous paper , were actually declining  --  copepod existence was threatened like so much else . The most abundant life form in the world was beginning to die out . . . there were now 3,800 copepods in the cup . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out the implications of those missing 1,200 . Hard pragmatic evidence backed this up , or so he thought . Rather than doubt it , he had spent his time trying to understand the mental makeup that would allow her to sense this numerical slackening in the first place . Were n't all scientific discoveries , even accidental ones , dependent on a  | certain mind set to realize their significance ? Anya 's everyday personality was not a gloomy one by any means , and yet a tendency to see things worse than they really were was there . The legacy of her parents ' indifference ? The hurt she had received , even accidentally , from him ? If she was right in her science it may not have had anything to do with these at all . If she was wrong  --  if the evidence was not there  --  then either clumsiness of method was behind it , or some tragic set in her instincts ; and , whatever else the oceanography establishment said about her , she had never been clumsy . He glanced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it unawares . It looked healthy enough . The surface a hard gray blue , spilling over into transparency where the waves tripped against the shelving bench . Pebbles beneath it , green ones like so many emeralds . A harmless froth of stranded foam . There was no oil on the surface , no hypodermics or condoms or any of the other bitter floatsam that washed ashore all up and down the Eastern seaboard during summer . As for the inner sea ? Well , he was no judge of that . Maybe there was war there just as there was war on the rest of the planet , more savage among the protozoa than anything man could manage himself . The copepods were dying ? Again , what sign had alerted Anya to this , what distress signal or flare ? He pushed himself to his feet , dusted the sand off , started up the bank so he could take the old Coast Guard path through the beach grass . It was windier there , a gritty wind , but he turned his collar to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expression . Never grimace , his father had told him the first time he had ever been sent alone to watch the sheep . Curse the wind , hate it , but never flinch . The house was quiet when he got back , Marcia off with  | the boy on another of her attempts to communicate . All the better . He went right to the kitchen , rummaged through the messages pinned to the wall until he found the number , quickly pressed it out . " Simon Hale , hello ? " " Hello , Simon . I have n't finished the column yet . " " Oh ? What column is that , Max ? " Max laughed  --  the sound of it , amplified by the receiver , merged with Simon 's higher laugh on the other end . Simon was young , not much past forty , and yet already he was the best editor Max had ever worked with . Very much part of the pragmatic new breed , at least in surface things , he remained a hopeless romantic when it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even the lowliest of their reporters with his head pensively tilted , as if the reporter in question were the wisest person in the world , and this had the effect of making everyone want to surpass themselves so as not to disappoint him . Lately there had been talk of personal problems ( a troubled marriage ; a child with some rare disabling disease ) , but this never seemed to affect his judgement . They talked at first about the usual things . Sunday 's editorial on Japan that had brought the State Department down on them ; a strike the delivery union was threatening ; new changes in Washington . If anything , there was something suspiciously leisurely in Simon 's manner , and it was Max himself who put the conversation back on track . " I 'm working on the column , Simon . I 've thrashed out some ideas . " " Oh , no hurry ! I would n't even bother you about it , except the syndicates are on my ass . We want you to feel you can say what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words in the magazine . " " With the fashion ads ? No thanks . "  | " Surely you 'll need the room ? Since it 's your last . " " I 've been meaning to talk to you about the magazine , Simon . You ca n't tell the copy from the ads anymore . It 's all one glitzy blur . " " And Max Thomas is anti-glitz ? " " I 'm of a generation that learned to think in black and white . " " No moral shadings ? " " You 're good , Simon . Very snappy . But save me two thousand words right where you always do and I 'll go out meekly . " " Give me a date . We want to talk it up , make it an occasion . " " Which is what I 'm afraid of . Listen , Simon ? " " No , Max . I 'm sorry . No fireworks going off , no trumpets . I promise . We 'll publish it in a whisper if that 's what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actually made a grabbing motion with his fist . " April first . " Simon laughed . " No comment ! But I 'll hold you to that if you do n't mind . Now what about the other column ? The one on your friend Ferris up there in New Hampshire ? " " I 've been procrastinating on that one , too . When 's the primary ? " " You know better than I do . Two weeks from Tuesday . Whoever gets the momentum there is going to be hard to stop . Has Ferris made his prediction yet ? " For a moment Max did n't hear  --  he was squinting out the window to where a dirty gull pecked at the bird feeder . " Max ? " " No , no prediction . I had a postcard from him yesterday . He 's expecting me . " " And ? " " I 'll call the airport tomorrow . "  | " Fine . Any thoughts about combining the two ? Ending the column with Ferris just like you started with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it  --  perhaps not . I mean , it 's your decision , but we 'd like your actual last column to be , well , valedictory . Do one on Ferris 's prediction , of course  --  can we say next week ? ? but then some appropriate last thoughts for the final one in April . " Last thoughts on what ? Max wanted to ask . For the first time ever he felt a childish need for guidance , but Simon was rattling on now , saying how much the column would be missed , how there would be no standards left in Washington without him , let alone New York . . . how every other columnist was a mere commentator compared to him , and  --  with no irony in his tone ! ? how he was the last journalist left who remained in touch with the America the founding fathers envisioned . Max listened to this patiently enough , only wincing at the word America . Wincing as he always did now  --  it was as inexplicable as a sudden nervous tic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . What was more alarming was that Simon should think flattery so necessary . He tried remembering his last column , the one on the new nationalism , tried to measure if it was up to snuff . Had he so obviously lost his grip ? Still , Simon was a flatterer by nature , and this did n't surprise him as much as what he said next . " Now when exactly are you going to New Hampshire , Max ? " " I did n't say . " " Why I ask . Nathan Zetland stopped by the office today . He 's flying up to see you next week . Here , I wrote it down . He 'll be arriving next Tuesday on the early flight from LaGuardia . " That was a real stunner  --  for a moment , Max did n't know  | what to say . Zetland was the senior columnist on the paper after him , the sharpest humorist in the country , his oldest friend . " Nathan ? Well , why did n't he call me himself ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're sending him to pry that last column out of me , are n't you ? " " Now listen , Max . I had nothing to do with it , other than talking to him about some concerns . There are developments he likes here even less than you do . The Sunday magazine for starters . Why , you two are the heart and soul of this paper , and it 's not a bad thing to have heart and soul get together once in a while to talk things out . And ? " " And what ? " " We 're all concerned . About Anya 's death . We know how hard it must be going on alone . Jesus , Max . He 's your friend . " Max turned away from the phone , stared out through the window again , but this time the gull was gone . " What time ? " he asked weakly . " Tuesday , nine A.M. I wish I could be there just to hear you guys reminisce . Hey , how 's that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? I 'll call next week to see how things are progressing . " He remained by the counter after Simon hung up , feeling like someone who admits to the doctor he 's sick , then finds out it 's much worse than he thought . Nathan coming ? Well , it was n't unprecedented , he was a man who would fly around the world to shoot the breeze , and yet under the circumstances . . . He thought about calling him , finding out what was up , but by then Marcia was in the kitchen , clearing things off the counter so she could get dinner ready . Cooking was the one domesticity she allowed herself  --  he had been fed roy-  | ally in the month she 'd been there  --  and he knew enough not to get in her way . He brushed off her questions with a feeble wave of the hand , then went out to the parlor to light up the woodstove , concentrating on the familiar routine of getting the house ready for night . They ate dinner quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Devon following her expression with the kind of over-attentiveness you often saw in children with divorced parents . He helped her clear the dishes , balancing the plates on his head like he was on safari , depositing them in the sink with a careful tilt forward so they slid ; in everything but words he seemed animated enough , even happy . Max had often heard of three-yearolds who were slow to talk , and yet , with Devon 's imagination , perhaps it was cause for concern after all . He was becoming so good with gestures and pantomime he might be tempted to forgo words altogether , lapse into an odd sort of autism where he could n't be reached . What did Marcia say ? Three more weeks , then back to New York . He would miss them when they left . The house would seem empty , lonely , all the cliches . But even the temptation to self-pity made him feel horribly older , and it was this he fled from the moment the dishes were done . He always spent an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day 's writing , then fiddling with the shortwave until he found the BBC . Tonight , though , he was too absorbed in his own thoughts to pay much attention to the news . Nathan 's coming surprised him so much he 'd hardly paid attention to the other half of Simon 's message  --  that a column was expected on Ferris and the New Hampshire primary , expected soon . Ferris , the image he had of him , could not be rushed . It was as if to even think of him briefly required his imagination to travel the same slow , circuitous route by which he  | had first discovered him  --  no detours permitted , no shortcuts , memory requiring every stop along the way . And yet this was harder each time : the young man Max had been became more distant , the country it had been became more distant ; facts came , but robbed by the years of their texture . Once he got started , became lost in it , things were easier ? it was that initial effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had led to finding him had been difficult . After ten years in Europe , Max had returned home , tired of war , tired of being an exile , ready to fall in love with his own country again , even though he already sensed its moment of supremacy would be brief . He would chronicle this supremacy  --  he was young enough to think in those terms  --  but he would also chronicle its decline , and if anything he felt a greater sense of mission when it came to the latter responsibility . After its triumph the country would retreat back into isolationism , he was sure of it , but unlike every other columnist of the day he guessed it would be the isolation that came with hedonism , a personal isolation  --  that it would soon be every man for himself in America , and what cohesion the country had , what community , would be squandered in satisfying a materialism that was mindless , unstoppable , a monster devouring its own . But much of this came later . On that March day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade 's hard work in Europe , rewarded by some miracle with his own column in the country 's most prestigious newspaper , frightened by this , wondering what on earth he would use to begin . That year was the first New Hampshire primary to attract national interest , and it had not been particularly brilliant of him to assume it would make good debut column , though there were those on the paper who sniffed at  | this , wondered why he would waste his time on anything so insignificant . He took a train from Grand Central  --  it was a day when there were still trains ! He went back to the smoker , ready to overhear some good conversation , but the car stank of old ginger ale and the businessmen who slumped there talked only of share prices and commodities . With his eager notepad , his shabby Eighth Army overcoat , he felt badly out of place , and it was n't until the train left him off in the cold air of Concord that he began to breathe . He borrowed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald , obsequious man named Harris , then headed north , with no better plan than to get a sense of what the state was thinking . There were no interstates those days ? he was onto dirt roads almost immediately  --  and he had n't gone five miles before he had to get out and wire up the tailpipe to keep it from scraping . There were mills along every stream , some still operating , but many that were deserted , their brick walls covered with moss . Abandoned farms , too ; everywhere in the hills were signs of depopulation . A country of ghosts  --  it was amazing how quickly he had entered it  --  and yet there was an intoxicating stillness over the land , as if it were resting under thin snow after a labor that had been exhausting and prolonged . The larger farms were along the major rivers , and these at any rate still seemed prosperous . Occasionally , out on the meadows , was a red , white and blue Taft sign , but nothing for Eisenhower . He stopped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women sitting there in the cafes , dressed to their ears in plaid mackinaws , were every bit as laconic as the New England stereotype , and the few words he got out of them had nothing to do with politics . By nightfall he had worked his way to the fringe of the mountains . There were tourist cabins , the kind that reeked  | of bad honeymoons , and after a greasy dinner , a warm beer , he tried his best to sleep . Toward morning he was woken by the rattle of hail on the window ; sitting there , wrapped in a blanket , he watched the sky slowly lighten into an ugly mix of black and gray . It was one of those March mornings only the north country could come up with , a mix of snow and rain that managed to combine the worst qualities of both in an entirely different substance , and yet , driving recklessly fast up the macadam , he felt exhilarated as he had n't been in years . A young man 's exuberance , the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt in traveling alone across the blank canvas of his future . All these were part of it , but even deeper was the quieter satisfaction of arriving at last , after ten years of conflict and war , in that most blessed of places : a forgotten land no one wanted . These were real mountains now , the snow slanting over as if to align itself with their slopes . The villages were smaller , neater , centered around white churches ; the monuments on the commons were for the Civil War , with long lists of names like Tilden and Converse and Balch . The people in the cafes seemed more willing to talk ( they were confused about Korea , indifferent to McCarthy , apt to favor Taft among the Republicans ) , but he still had n't found what he wanted , and when afternoon came he was beginning to feel the entire trip had been a mistake after all . On a whim , just before turning back toward Concord , he swerved off onto a side road that was n't marked with any sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a pothole -- Harris would scream when he saw his car  --  but he kept on anyway , doing his best to skirt the mud that ran like a brown river down the center of the road . The grade climbed steeply at first , then leveled off . For a  | mile nothing was visible in the snow besides bare trees , but then the sky cleared a bit , the snow let up , and he saw rising on either side of the road and pinching in toward it two abrupt mountains  --  it was like entering a tunnel that did n't have a roof . They were bald , at least the upper thirds , their granite glistening in a sunlight that disappeared before hitting the road . A good place for an ambush , he decided  --  it was odd how instinctively the old reactions came back  --  but lured by the brightness he kept on , wheels spinning now , the rear of the car swerving back and forth like a motorboat struggling through heavy chop . A stone wall on the right seemed just as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went another mile without seeing a house . Time to go back . He found what he thought was a firm-looking shoulder , backed up onto it , brought the steering wheel around , carefully accelerated , and , after one precarious second of traction , became hopelessly stuck . He got out , furious at himself for being so hasty . He threw some pine boughs under the tires , but that was no help . There was a thick lilac a few yards up the road , and with a rope he might have managed to anchor the axle , keep it from swerving . But there was no rope in the trunk , not even some cord . He stepped back to study the situation . If anything , the tires seemed to be sinking lower in the mud , sending up gelatinous black bubbles just to mock him . It was then he heard a sound that may well have been there all along : the dry rhythmic cough of wood being split apart by an axe . It seemed to come from behind the lilac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway branching off to the left , and this is what he followed , ducking under apple branches into a field . An old Cape-style farmhouse rested in its center , chim-  | Heys on either end , the siding of weathered cedar shakes , the shutters painted in a fresh coat of red that had n't yet reached the tops . On the porch in front was some decorative gingerbread  --  between posts , the metal hooks for a hammock . A rusty John Deere tractor was parked by the attached ell ; a pre-war Ford in the mud by the house . Chickens ran from one to the other , alarmed at someone new , in a panic of chicken-ness , using the bulky fenders for pro-tection . It was no neater , no more derelict than any of the other farms he had passed , though with the spotty cover of snow it was impossible to judge the condition of the fields . The mountains , so oppressive and threatening before , backed away here , so the house , even under the grayness , seemed bathed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn . A young collie waited patiently by the opened doors ; rather than barking it wagged its tail , all eagerness and welcome . " Hi there pup , " Max said , reaching down to scratch its ear . " Your master home ? Hello there ! Anyone home ? " He continued on until he came to the field side of the barn . There in an ankle-deep pool of wood chips and sawdust stood a man splitting logs on top of a stump . He was shirtless in the cold , the red-blonde hair on his chest glistening as if he were sweating out his own version of sun . He did n't seem aware of Max 's presence ; he swung the axe in a motion that managed to combine both precision and joy , splitting the chunks in one blow , then reaching smoothly down for another from the jumbled pile at his back . Max moved closer , drawn by something he would have been hard-pressed to name . The man 's jaw was broad , dull even , yet set with a single-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips were cracked red from the sun , but full and supple when compared to the dour thinness of  | the faces he had seen so far . Above them his cheekbones and nose were perfect , strong and well-defined , as if whatever character was in him advertised itself by their prominence . His eyes , even from that distance , were the silver gray that missed nothing ; his forehead , fringed with an unruly shock of blonde hair , was unlined below it , broad enough to complement the stubbornness of the jaw with its obvious intelligence . Even then , at that first glimpse , Max knew it was the strongest male face he had ever seen . Below it his body was medium-sized and wiry , hardly a match for it , and yet in anyone else it would have been something to brag about , with a muscled chest , beautifully shaped arms and the kind of tight-corded thighs Max had seen on European soccer players . The only blemish was at the bottom : he had lost three toes in some unspecified accident and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . There by the barn all Max had been aware of was perfection , and what was more , looking up and spotting him now , this perfect man had a smile so wide it seemed a second smile superimposed atop the first , as if he were laughing at the world and at himself simultaneously . " Come to help me ? " he asked , with no surprise in his voice . Max shrugged . " Sure . " " Handle an axe ? " " Some . As a boy . " " Well then . Pitch right in . " Max took off his overcoat , rolled his sleeves up , grabbed an extra axe that lay beside the stump . At first he felt clumsy , but gradually the old stroke came back . Upswing of the arms , tightening of the wrists , lock them  --  wham ! Beside him his new partner worked just as hard , and the pile of cordwood rapidly diminished . At one point ,  | with an extra little hitching motion , the man increased his pace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and for the next ten minutes they were caught up in an unspoken race , chopping furiously , the split halves flying past their heads . Max , on the point of collapsing , managed to glance over at him . He was smiling , nodding in approval , as if he knew now what Max could do  --  and then without any noticeable change in his stroke he really began chopping , splitting three logs for every one of Max 's , until finally all the wood was gone . It was a long time before Max caught his breath . The man , he was glad to see , was puffing too  --  not because he really had to , he realized later , but out of instinctive politeness and tact . In the silence , without the work between them , they were each shy of the other ; a moment before it became awkward , the man swept the hair out of his eyes and stuck out his hand , smiling even more broadly than before . " My name is Ferris . " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My car ? " he began . Ferris 's eyebrows shot up . " That road eat another one ? Studebaker or Ford ? Well , we 'll fix that easy enough . Gets hungry after a long winter . Why once that road swallowed the country snowplow , blade and all . It was a long time digesting it , too . Hey , nice to meet you ! By the lilac you say ? Come back in a month , you 'll see what that lilac can do . Newspaperman , is it ? Well , for a minute I took you for a preacher . You look like a man who 's got serious considerations . You know how to use an axe though . What are you doing come November ? I could use a hand like you . fesus , it gets lonely , I 'll admit that . Nobody reads books anymore , not up here . A newspaper fella could answer all my questions in between splitting wood . "  | He kept talking non-stop all the way to the road , nonstop while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car back to the house . It was as if the silent land had been waiting to express itself in his voice and his voice alone . The house was furnished simply , with the kind of oak furniture that was n't old enough yet to be thought of as antique . Pictures covered the walls , mostly of family , but in a place of honor over the rolltop desk was someone Max recognized as Eugene Debs . There were books everywhere , arranged in piles as if someone had set themselves the task of reading them in a certain order . " Follow me right out here to the kitchen . Duck your head for that beam  --  you would n't be the first it knocked out . Well , look who 's here , Lydia ! A newspaperman come all the way from New York just to help with the cordwood ! Now do n't be shy , Mr. Thomas . I know you 've seen your share of pregnant women and Lydia 's no more pregnant than most . A girl she 's carrying  --  I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine . Lyd , any of that coffee left on the stove ? Pour it right on your hands , Mr. Thomas ! No better way to cut through the grease . Help yourself to those lemon donuts , too . " His wife was a thin woman , pretty enough in a measured , self-contained kind of way , and if she seemed frail it was only in comparison to his vitality . Her eyes had the kind of brightness that could go either way depending on what life brought her , fanned and encouraged into something like vivacity , or doused and extinguished by indifference . For now she smiled to herself like someone who held all the cards ; if men wanted to play at talking serious , it was all right with her . Once their coffee was poured she disappeared toward the parlor . . . seemed , in her dark  | maternity clothes , to deliberately make herself part of the woodwork . . . and they were left alone to talk . Ferris was working five jobs at once then . Logging still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the government survey who were starting on new maps . They only called him for the hardest surveys , the most difficult country to penetrate , but there was a lot that met that description in the mountains , and he 'd worn out three pairs of snowshoe rigging in the last three months . A little farming , the maple-syrup operation , even a week here and there teaching history at the local school . He 'd do anything , as long as it did n't interfere with his conception of himself as a totally free man . His parents were remarkable people , self-educated like Max 's own  --  he talked about them that first afternoon , too . He talked about his service in the war , but only briefly . He 'd been a guard at a New Hampshire camp for German P.O.W. 's , but it was disappointing work , and for the first time since meeting him Max saw his face darken , got mumbles from him rather than words . Max changed the subject . He 'd seen nothing but Taft signs since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that ? " Eisenhower , " he said , without hesitation . " No contest . " Max brought out his pad . " How come you 're so sure ? " Ferris took another sip of coffee , thought it over this time before answering . " Well , I 'm voting for Ike . Lydia is voting for Ike . Ethan Swan over on the next place is voting for Ike . That 's three to zero right there , and my Uncle Wilbert over in Warren is voting for him , too  --  we talked last night on the phone . No , I 'm teasing you , mister . You want a serious answer ? People trust Eisenhower . He smiles and it 's like your father smiling at you on the best day of your life . Then there 's that war business . People still feel proud  | of that , they know it was the biggest thing in their life , and so they want to stay part of it somehow , vote for a general . But that 's a good word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself anyway . Primary all the way ! " They sat there all afternoon talking , not just about the primary , but about the local school , how it was getting harder to keep it open with only five pupils , the young people all leaving for the city , and the old people , too , how they were rapidly dying out , the ones who remembered the country before machines and automobiles changed everything out of recognition . . . talking until it was dark out and Ferris got up to light the kerosene lamp that overhung the table . Ferris did most of the talking , requiring Max only to ask a question here and there to gently steer him ; over three cups of coffee he got enough good sense to fill ten columns , let alone one . Then , as later , what Max was impressed by was n't so much his sophisticated political reasoning ( even then he sensed Ferris was actually bored by anything political ) , but his deep intuitive sense , when it came to that land and its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Ferris . That 's what he came north every four years to find . Over the years he got to know Ferris better , of course , but what he learned later only confirmed that overpowering first impression . Ferris had , in unusual concentration , all the traits Max thought of as peculiarly American . A natural exuberance . Hatred of affectation . A high opinion of his own capabilities ; the assumption he was as good as anyone and anyone was as good as he . Pride without arrogance . A selfdeprecating sense of humor . A patriotism that was the ancient kind , love of the parish , of his own small corner of land . Physical bravery . A childish eagerness toward all things mechanical . Delight in improvisation . Curiosity . Openness . A wisdom that came from the tasks he could  | solve with his hands . The impossible-to-erase optimism that , beat up on by the century , only went deeper and harder , biding its time . There were other traits Ferris had that divided him from most Americans just as markedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Money meant little to him . lie liked to , as the Russians put it , philosophize . In a country of nomads , he had remained in one spot . In a country of amnesics , he remembered , remembered hard . The bad side of all this ? Well , Ferris had his faults , he supposed . But he did n't want to know the bad side in him , he who knew it so well in everyone else . It was the reward for his having seen through so many others  --  to have one man in the world he could idealize , set on a pedestal , indulge himself in the luxury of not seeing through . Behind him on the bookcase the radio rattled off a fresh burst of static , as if trying to regain his attention . Almost midnight now  --  early morning in London , and once again came the news . Was it Nathan 's line ? How less dreadful events seemed when read in well-enunciated English ? The events were painful enough , God knows . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving refugees , reports of a new plague bacillus that was resistant to all known drugs . . . and yet he realized , with more than a little surprise , that he felt better now than he had all day . Even to think of Ferris was to borrow some of his sanity and wisdom . It got his imagination rolling again , restored his certainty , made things clear . Ferris would be his last column , in Ferris 's own words . Of course  --  why had n't he seen the rightness of this when Simon first mentioned the possibility ? He would go to the Notch , check in with how Ferris was doing , how he saw things here at the end of the century , get his prediction on this latest primary , go out where he 'd started , make the  | circle complete after all . If he had shrunk so long from going it was only a reluctance to face a north-country February  --  and yet now that he had made his decision he realized this was exactly the tonic he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . He glanced again at the clock , wondered if it was too late to call the airport for reservations . Ferris would need some warning  --  Tuesday , he would go on Tuesday . There would still be a week left before the primary , giving him four days to write the column . But no  --  Nathan was coming on Tuesday . Very well , Wednesday . On Wednesday at this time he and Ferris would be sitting in his kitchen again , the same kerosene lamp hanging over the table , the two of them warming their hands over their coffee mugs as they talked . Alone now  --  both of them were alone . But that was all right , too . This time they could really get down to things , talk forever , talk so long they just might cheat death altogether , two grizzled heads there was simply no stopping . In any case , a good night 's work  --  he found the same satisfaction in making the decision as he did in finishing a difficult column . It was only later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other task awaiting his attention : the talk he had promised Marcia . Too late now ? She often stayed up the same way he did , going over the scripts and scenarios media consultants dealt in . There was no light on in her room . He felt both guilty and relieved at this , but then in tiptoeing back through the hall he saw a thin wedge of yellow leading up to Anya 's study , saw a shadow cross it , heard steps . It was Marcia ; by the time he climbed to the room she had come to a stop near the window seat that faced the ocean . She stood there smoothing back her hair , her dark robe matching with its drape the shadow from the win-  | ( low 's indentation , so it was only by squinting that he was able to make her out . " Restless ? " he asked quietly . " I was , too . " " Dad ? " Startled , she turned around quickly , stepping forward so the shadows came apart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rare enough occurrence . " " Tell me about it . I 've spent the last three months beating my head against a wall . " He pointed . " See ? Scars . " But she would n't smile , not this time . " I tried to sleep . The house is so quiet . I kept thinking about when I was twelve and how I would wake up at night trying to remember if this was one of the spells where you were home or one of the spells where you were gone . It always worried me , not being able to know which it was . " Marcia , even with her hands slack at her sides , often suggested someone who held them clenched before her eyes  --  wary , ready to punch , even at the most inappropriate times . And why ? He could have told her a few things about worry  --  how it was n't until she was born , not until he had a hostage to fortune , that he began to really comprehend how many possibilities there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able for the first time to understand even partially the world 's suffering . " I was remembering something else , too , " she said , softening her voice now , letting the fists fall . " How when Mom was sick she would stand here by this window looking out . How often she checked the sea . She had to be reassured , had to have contact with it even from a distance . I mean it was n't a lie , that story about her childhood . The sea was her best friend , and she hated being separated from it even for a second . " " And now she 'd not separated , Marcia . " " No . Now she is not separated . But those last days . I  | never saw anyone stare like that , will themselves so completely out of their body into another space . " It was too soon for this  --  Max felt the same kind of irritation he had experienced at the memorial service in Woods Hole . It was too soon to make even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle , he said to himself . For decency 's sake , let everything settle . He crossed to the other side of the studio , sat down on the window seat there , the one facing the marsh . Twenty feet separated them now , yet in the silence , in the bareness of the room , their voices seemed only inches apart . " Is Devon asleep ? " he asked , at a loss for anything else . She nodded . " I read to him tonight . That train book you bought him . He was humming toward the end  --  humming to the rhythm of the words . He tried making an S sound . I think he 's made a lot of progress since we came out here . His time with Dick always makes him slip back . " No surprise there . Dick was an investment banker , successful , smooth  --  a petty liar who was just bright enough to know there was something in life he was missing . Divorcing Marcia had been the easy solution to his mid-life crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social set , an ex-wife in the background , a child seen on weekends , was all but required . But no  --  he was being unfair . There were real problems there as well . Ever since childhood Marcia had been chary of giving her love . With Anya there had always been a vague competitiveness that only relaxed when Marcia was grown . With boyfriends she had always been very much in command , bringing one well-bred puppet to the house after another . Dick was no puppet , and yet Marcia belittled him , too , in public and far too often . With Devon she was inconsistent , going from total involvement one moment to total neglect the next . That the one person she ever gave  | her love to without reservation was himself did not make it easier to witness all this ; quite the opposite . She was too much like him , from her height to her eyes to her impa-tience . What had Anya said about her ? That as long as she had a definite purpose in life she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once her intelligence slipped into neutral , came unharnessed , like Icarus in the sunlight she would crash . She could always read his thoughts . Across the room in the soft light he could see her tuck her legs up under her robe , hug them tight as if she were a girl again , the two of them talking the way they did early in the mornings before anyone else was awake . Talking too seriously , he supposed . He had filled her head too soon with too many ponderous things . Later she had argued with him just as fiercely as with all the others who dared come too close , but with one rule : in the mornings , in the quiet , there was truce . Her voice , too  --  in these moments it could still have the same yearning , hesitant quality it had when she was little . " Is your back all right ? I saw the aspirin bottle . " " Not too bad now . I did n't mean to duck you before . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way to start . I was remembering that summer Mom took me to sea . She was a different person when she was working , had her research close at hand . There was an alertness about her on boats I never saw at home . I mean , her whole body was filled with it , especially her face . Her freckles ! I never even realized at home that she had freckles , but out at sea ? The same with her hair . Was it so blonde anywhere else ? I used to pour sea water over her to wash it , and I remember wishing desperately it could be mine . " Enough ! he felt like saying . He would not let Anya 's memory be made wistful , whatever else happened . If Mar-  | cia had been nagging him to talk business , then now was the time , the sooner it was faced the better . " That was a good summer for you both . " " A great summer . I felt cheated when it came time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news coming out ? " Marcia stared out the window , as if toward a light , then , a moment before he decided she had n't heard him , swiveled around again , all trace of childishness gone . " Tobin 's article will be published April first . As things stand now anyway . In the oceanographic journal , just as he warned us . " " April first ? " " Why are you smiling ? Oh , I get it . April Fool 's . Well , he 's not fooling . Mom would n't have kept him as her research assistant for so long if he was n't in earnest about things . " Max peered down at his hands . " How bad is it ? " " Pretty bad , I 'm afraid . " " Oh come on , Marcia . I will not drop dead of shock . Say it plain . " " Tobin helped with the census figures on the copepods each summer , then for no apparent reason she pulled him off that job and did all the computation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Mom sampled the sea water off the Cape , there 's a plankton lab in Brisbane that handled Australia . . . Well , okay , I 'm sure you know this part already . But the idea was to get an accurate fix on the total copepod population in all the seas combined . This number she insisted was rapidly declining . Tobin has proof she changed the figures in each instance , made them much worse than they really were . If there is a decline , it 's a minor one , and there may not even be that . . . . The early figures she changed with a pen ,  | then later with a computer . She was clumsy about this . As Tobin put it in his letter , it 's almost as if she wanted to be caught . " Max nodded , made a weak gesture toward the corner where her desk had been . " Why ? " he managed . Marcia misunderstood him . " Tobin 's why ? I 'm not sure I know . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way of stepping out of that shadow . He has professional ambitions . At least he had the decency to wait until her death before starting to go public . " " That 's not what I mean . " " The sexiest angle ? Okay , she was his boss , a woman . You can see it in the clips where they 're in the skiff together . He all but yanks the tiller from her hands  --  let me command . This could certainly be a part . " " Or maybe he has a regard for the truth . " " Oh ? You mean the man does , the woman does n't ? " He held his hand up in a stop motion  --  their old signal when things threatened to get too fierce . She nodded ? message received  --  then paced back and forth along the far wall , her slippers scuffing the bare wood floor , her bathrobe billowing at the bottom like the heavy robe of a judge . " There 's only one thing to do of course . Tobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll fly down and see him , try to reason with him . " " You mean change his mind ? " " Make sure he knows what 's at stake . Especially when the TV people pick up on it , the big papers . Everything Mom stood for , right down the drain . I want to talk to Muriel Todd , too . She 's the editor at the oceanographic journal . They 're in Miami , so I can do it all in one swoop . " He frowned . " Why does the phrase damage control ' keep coming to me ? " She waved his objection away with her hand , rubbed it  | right out of the darkness between them . " I want Tobin to be aware of what he 's doing , that 's all . I want Muriel Todd to consider running an article concurrently with his that you and I could team up on . We admit the charges right up front , neither condoning what she did nor condemning it . Then we stress the exculpatory reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , she was so concerned about its health that she was tempted to exaggerate a danger that clearly exists . She wanted to raise the alarm , and this she managed to do , so there is no questioning the overall value of her work . " " Surely they understood that already ? " " Third , her cancer . We tread lightly here , keep it in reserve . Obviously it affected her judgement long before she fell sick . But these are factors and we insist they be brought out . " She stopped , turned to face him , her face tight with something very much like eagerness as she waited for his response . It was difficult to know what to make of all this ? obviously she had given it so much thought  --  and yet all the time he listened he had felt his depression grow worse . He remembered Marcia as a girl , presenting him with a crayoned picture she had labored hours over  --  how he marvelled at it , ooh'ed and ah'ed for her benefit . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head up to face her . " Why ? " he asked , this time with more force . In all her measuring , her considering every angle , had she ever asked herself this ? She answered him fast enough at any rate . " For the above reasons , " she said . " The ocean is sick , Mom was sick  --  for those reasons . " " That 's not good enough , " he said , frowning , feeling like he was deliberately pushing her picture away . " Why , Marcia . Why did the little boy cry wolf ? "  | " Because he wanted attention . " " Whose attention ? " " Well yes  --  she already was a celebrity . You mean her dead parents ? Always the love-starved little child ? She worked through that years ago . Anyone with less character , yes . Mom , no . Not because of childish hurt . " " My attention then . " " What ? That 's crazy . " She waved her hand , unwilling to hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you that she might be wrong on her copepods , and yet right in her thesis ? The environment is doomed  --  there 's plenty of evidence . She was wrong on this particular wolf , but there are plenty more out there and they 're moving closer . " It was odd his reaction to all this . He felt injured , like he was the person who had been wronged  --  felt at the bottom of his anger the stubborn refusal a man feels when he 's been pushed around long enough . " I 'm not reading you , " she said , when the silence went on . " Uh , Dad ? " " There will be no damage control operation , " he said , speaking as slowly and precisely as he could . " No denials , no attacks . We let the truth come out . " She glared at him  --  even across the room he could feel the heat of her anger . " Why ? So Max Thomas ca n't be accused of engaging in a coverup ? So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you Dad ? How things work these days . I mean , welcome to the real world . " The real world , not getting it  --  how to answer accusations like these ? Still , if anything it made him feel even more stubborn , made him resolve to dig his heels in deeper . " I know you think this is terribly old-fartish of me , Marcia , but even in these degenerate times men and women have a certain responsibility when it comes to truth . Their own truth and the truth of their family . "  | " The truth of the family ? Do n't go patriarchal on me , Dad . Not at this stage . " He ignored her , kept talking . " I used to think when it came to truth it was every man for himself . Obviously in your world it still is . But there 's a collective responsibility as well . " " What do you know about my world ? " she shot back . Nothing , he wanted to say . Goddam nothing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-thoughtout phrases at each other . " Look Marcia , " he said , trying again . " I 'll buy part of your argument . That Mom was sick  --  that it clouded her judgement . She was nearly insane with pain . But this is for us alone . We offer no excuses to the rest of the world . Why she did it , whatever drove her to change those figures . She did it with her eyes open and it would be wrong to duck the consequences . " He could see her face redden with that  --  how her generation hated the word wrong ! She drew her breath in to blast him away with her realism , totally humiliate him , but then came a thinner , higher-pitched sound from the shadows by the stairway , as if the darkness had decided to intervene with a comment of its own . " It 's Devon , " she said , after a minute . " He 's calling mama . ' " Max listened , even got up to take a step closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said stupidly . " It sounds like he 's just moaning in his sleep . You used to do that . . . . This trip of yours down south . I take it that means you 'll be leaving early ? " " I tell you he 's calling my name ! " she shouted , all but crying . " Hear it ? He 's talking ! " He put his arm out , felt an overpowering need to hold her close . " Marcia , come over here . "  | But too late . She hurried from the room , her slippers scuffing out the soft crying from below . Max stood by the door , trying to hear the sound as an actual word , but it remained formless and undefined . In a minute it was gone entirely , replaced by the hoarse , plaintive note of the foghorn out at Nauset  --  a good sound normally , but one that now settled across the back of his neck like a chill . He pressed his face to the window , tried seeing past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling kind that magnified everything it cloaked , and yet in the darkness there was nothing to magnify except itself ; it was like staring out , not at something physical , but at a quality , isolation or sadness or woe . Nights like these in the old days had claimed more ships than storms . He tried imagining what it was like , shuddered again at the prospect . To die in the fury of a storm was one thing , breakers crashing around you , all in chaos , but to go deaf and blind in smothering nothingness ? The thought was not to be borne . Did he hate the sea then ? Yes , in moments like these there was no use pretending otherwise . For a moment he felt a surge of homesickness , and for Washington of all places . To be again where there was nothing that was n't artificial ! Where pavement laughed cynically at every emotion , good or bad , and broiled them lifeless in its heat . He knew the mood would pass . In the morning the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being anywhere hut here . But if isolation was hammering so hard to get his attention , perhaps he would be wise to consider it  --  to make the same weary struggle toward understanding he had made so many times before . Isolation  --  fit theme for tonight ! Not that he had anything new to contribute . As a young man whose formative experience were of a land so vast humans were lost in it , then later of war , he had come to the conclusion that man  | was doomed to solitude , and nothing that happened since had ever managed to change his mind . Solidarity existed , of course  --  he had seen it do miraculous things , in peace as well as in war . He had done his best to foster it himself , tried bridging the gaps in culture and history that separated people , tried his hardest to emphasize the links  --  the concept of world federalism was practically his own in-vention . And yet in private life what had he done except manage to keep three people in a solitude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , he still felt responsible for Anya 's fraud , could n't help trying to tie it back to something in their marriage he had done or had n't done . He went down the list the same way he had every night since her death , as if their forty years together could be totalled up and scored . Support ? In the conventional sense , fine . Freedom ? A-plus on that , he had never stood in her way . Encouragement ? High marks there as well . Anya you can do it , the hell with those academic snobs ? was n't this the refrain of their middle years when she struggled so hard ? Understanding ? They were intellectual soul mates . Sex ? Occasional always , frantic sometimes , all in all  --  satisfactory . Fidelity ? Lapses on his side , mostly during the long war in Europe , one serious with a British WREN , a press officer in intelligence who had died in a train accident the day before Normandy . Fewer since then ; he 'd never gone in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media celebrities , and for a good many years now he had found himself responding to attractive women with a mix of wry amusement and sexual nostalgia , but nothing stronger . On Anya 's part ? A mystery , she was so private it was a miracle thinking she shared with him what she did , let alone imagining her with any lover . Companionship ? Perfect , and yet maybe too perfect  --  of  | all the emotions possible between two people , why had he been so willing to settle for that one and that one alone ? Solitude was n't intellectual for Anya , but something she had felt trapped in ever since those childhood days when she walked the shore alone . Whatever had drawn her to lying  --  whatever made her want to see doom before anyone else  --  must have sprung from those years , and yet throughout their marriage he never recognized the force of her loneliness , had done nothing to assuage its sting . Companionship ? For a woman who could feel as deeply as Anya it was n't nearly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least love her the way she deserved . The love , that is , that knew isolation was ultimately total , man irremediably alone , yet acted as if none of this were true after all , fought constantly to overcome the barriers that walled people off . Anya was born for a great love , he had only given her a good one , and there was no need to look further for his sin . He could feel it now at any rate  --  the pain of disappointing her . As he stared out toward the fog , trying to penetrate it toward the flat beam of the Nauset light , he felt like someone were chipping away at his chest with an vasion axe of nothingness  --  not a burning sensation , but cold hollow one that shuddered and spread with each new blow . Any more of this and he would become like the fog ; the flimsy excuse of skeleton that separated him from would be gone entirely , the churning obscurity inside leased at last , blown out into the world with all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enShrouded the planet . Without a fight ? He tried pulling back , did his best to think of the things that still anchored him . Marcia , his andson , the work that remained . He would not die of loneliness as so many did , and yet in this mood , with all  | pretense stripped away , he recognized there was nothing better to die from : to face fate alone and be overwhelmed . But not tonight . It was cold in the bare room , colder still downstairs , and he would have to throw more wood on the stove if he was to keep things comfortable in the bedrooms . Simple tasks . How many souls had been saved by these ! He had turned from the window seat to go when some last impulse toward tidiness made him cross over to the corner where Anya 's desk had been . There was light there  --  the spotlight on the barn spilled across the patio , the fog bending it upwards so part of the room was softened in a milky haze . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to arrange , and yet in bending down to align them he noticed a white envelope lying under the baseboard radiator along the wall . Had it blown there while he was reading the letters ? There was something precise , something deliberate in the way it was hidden , and the envelope was covered with dust , as if it had lain there a long time . Curious , he brought it up to the light , brushed off the surface . It had been opened  --  a smooth cut from Anya 's letter knife . The postmark was from New Hampshire , dated September 15 , 1965 . He took out the notepaper  --  carefully , since it seemed brittle as parchment  --  then remembered he had n't looked at the address in front . Yes , it was addressed to Anya , in a woman 's handwriting that was thin and spidery ; automatically , by the evidence of its shape and the postmark , it conjured up the image of Lydia Ferris  --  not the pregnant , half-pretty woman he had met that first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Lydia Ferris , as if with a sudden movement she were stepping out of the woodwork toward him with both arms raised .  | He turned back to the paper , his curiosity giving way to an odd sense of dread . He opened the fold , spread the paper out on his palm , squinted down . Only one word appeared on the page . It was printed , the letters taking up all the space , the pen that made them passed so hard the letters seemed grooved in , chiseled with a force only hate could supply . Whore , it read . He looked at it , the word making sense and yet no sense . He brought it up further , stared again . Whore !  | In the summer of 1965 , Max and Anya rented the Culbertson farm up from my place on the high road to Warren . He planned to take a sabbatical from his column to write a book about Jefferson and Adams  --  the political feud they kept up all those years leading to the reconciliation of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , a technical one about the sea . She hoped being away from it for a spell would clarify her thinking . The beach house they had bought on the Cape was being winterized , and they wanted to escape all the construction noise  --  there was that in their decision as well . I was the one who found the place for them , got it all ready . The last of the Culbertsons lived in Chicago , but he was sentimental about the farm and liked me to keep it up . The house sits under a grove of pine toward the back of the land . It 's the kind they built here in the 1790s  --  big and wide out the outside , but cozy inside , with fireplaces in all the rooms , bird's-eye maple for floors , and all kinds of nooks and crannies you can lose yourself wandering around  | . And it 's seen quite a parade over the centuries . All the people who have been born there , all the ones who have died . There 's been plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it brutal I suppose , but some that must have been passionate and tender . A good house to share with somee , but a heavy one to dwell in alone . I remember that summer as the prettiest we ever had here . The tassels on the locusts turned their cream color early and held it right through the month ; the crab apples tched them , staying pink for the longest time . The middle Julie it rained , just in time for the wildflowers to explode color . Black-eyed Susan in the meadows , Indian paintsh by the road , lady 's slippers in the shady spots . Their ightness seemed to bring the birds up  --  they rode in m the west on the afternoon breezes . Cardinals , tanas , goldfinch and buntings . We were visited by whole dclam flocks of them , birds on grand tour , birds galore . July 1 was fixed as the day Max and Anya were due to arrive . I spent the afternoon trying to convince Jordan it as n't some form of torture to be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck . Around three here was a plume of dust that rose and settled on the road . ought I 'd give them time to get settled , so it was n't until most dark I went over . It 's a fifteen-minute walk to the farm . A station wagon was parked out in front , the gate still open , a suitcase tering on its edge like someone had n't room to carry it eir last trip in . " Hello ? " I said quietly . In that kind of silence it would n't dO to shout . No one answered . I went around back past the herb Barden , stepping over the brick wall old man Culbertson had built to keep out the cows . The thyme was out in full spread and I thought maybe Max and Anya had followed  | the perfume down from the house . But nope  --  no one there either . I 'll not bother them , not tonight I decided . But then just before I went back I saw someone standing alone on the little patch of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky had draped itself around the silhouette , so it looked like a ghost wearing one of those old-fashioned damask cloaks . Whoever it was stood motionless , staring toward the birch that begin where the grass tilts over into a hill . I knew what was being looked at without actually seeing it myself . The birch form a perfect white shaft there and you can look right down it to a pond hardly wider than the shaft itself , but black-looking and deep . In that pond , catch it at the right moment , are the last moments of light , held there and mirrored , as if the birch had melted in its surface , stirring the black into white . It was Anya . I did n't figure that out until later , but it was Anya . Most people first come to that farm looking for views would have stared across the river toward the mountains , but here on her first night she went to the most beautiful and secret spot of all , in the best possible moment , found it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until later , was how lost she became in it  --  her ability to forget herself , give way just like those birch give way , dissolve into the moment in a way few people can . " Quite a view , " I said , stepping closer . It was clumsy to say anything , but I need n't have worried . She did n't hear me , but kept staring toward those birch , hugging her arms around herself in the chill of night , but otherwise standing as motionless as before , the afterglow framed there on her shoulders . It should n't be disturbed , that kind of stillness . I went around the long way to the road , took my time walking  | home . It was black enough now that the owls had started their calling . What do they call it , a parliament of owls ? Was like walking through a noisy parliament , all the hers hooting out questions , but where the road curved and toward my driveway I stopped and looked back ward the Culbertson house . A light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small , like a tulip , a yellow p set in a perfect vase of black . I watched that light for a long time . Eventually , a door mined , brought me out of it . Behind me , like an iron liar dropped across my neck , Lydia started screaming at my son . e next day was another hard one in the fields , but I quit ly , drove over to their farm . The station wagon was right here it had been the night before , only this time loaded th groceries . I had just picked up a bag when Anya came t the screen door alone  --  came out so quickly , all but skipping , it was hard to link her to the woman I had seen standing so motionless before those birch . The smallness Was the same  --  she was five four , but looked tinier . She had on jeans and a man 's flannel shirt with the tails out , the sleeves rolled way up her suntanned arms . Her hair was short , a dark kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered hiding it , and why should she since it was the smoothest , richest looking gray you could imagine Her face was covered with brown freckles , at least high on her cheeks , so you could see she spent a lot of time outdoors . All that came first , as she made her way up the path toward me , and it was only later I was able to fill in the details . She had an oval face , perfect everywhere but toward the chin where it widened out . Her eyes were right on the border between blue and gray , set improbably deep  | in such a small face  --  she hardly ever blinked , which made them seem even brighter than they really were . Her voice , when I heard it , was girlish and oddly hoarse . . . I always kidded her about becoming a country singer . . . but later on , watching her on TV , the girlish quality was gone , as if the wind and salt had gotten in there in its place . Her posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so relaxed and comfortable with herself it was a surprise to find a small spot of urgency in the way she held her head , which was just slightly forward from where most people hold it . Looking at her you wanted to place your hand on the base of her neck , let the tension flow away so she would drop her head back , stand easy . But Anya was more than the sum of her parts  --  the kind of person who does n't occupy space , but shapes it , changes it , molds it in a way you 've never seen before . Give anyone else her features and they would be undistinguished and plain ; with her , it all came out beautiful and I 've spent many years trying to understand the magic that made it so . What did we talk about that first afternoon ? Not much if I remember . We started off on the wrong foot altogether . " Mr. Ferris , are n't you ? " she said , extending her hand . " Call me Ferris . Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , like a school teacher this time . " Be fair . Call me Anya . " We were both wary of each other , no doubt about it . Here Max had been singing my praises to her , her praises to me , and I think this made us shy . Well no  --  jealous might be the more accurate description . We both occupied corners of Max 's world the other did n't . She looked at me surprised , too , like whatever she saw was n't anything she expected . Just before the silence became embarrassing she waved  | her hand toward the house . " Max wo n't be up until next Friday . He 's still in Paris . " " Paris ? " I grunted . " What 's he doing there , straightening out those goddam frogs ? " She did n't know how to take that . " Well yes , " she said hesitantly . " He 's talking to De Gaulle . " I do n't know why , but it made us laugh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . De Gaulle ! It made things a lot easier . " Let me carry those bags in for you , " I said . " Oh I can manage . " " Pump working fine ? You prime it like in the note ? " She nodded , make a little checking off motion with her hand . " Burnables you can put right in the barrel . Cans and glass I 'll pick up on Mondays . Call me if you need help with anything . " " Will do . " She saluted , smiled again . " I was going to pick some blueberries , leave them in the kitchen . They 're a day or two from being ripe . " " Oh I love blueberries ! " she said , her eyes going wide like a girl 's . That decided me . " Well then , how about going out to pick some ? Two can cover more ground than one . I 'm intending to go Sunday morning . " " I work in the morning . But if you come in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the week helping Hazen Matthews lay in a pipe from his spring . Sunday came in rainy , but about noon when it began to lighten I grabbed some buckets , headed for the door . Lyd , her lap covered in old books and newspapers , hardly looked up . She was working on her genealogies , which she did in all her spare time now . Tracing names in old family bibles , going over records in the  | town halls , trying to figure out which Pike begot which Willey , which Willey begot which Pike . To me it was even sadder than the animals she used to cut from women 's magazines , her trying to suture ties that had come undone years before . The Warner family , the Whitchers , the Grays ? all the old families from our part of the mountains . If they were one spreading tree years before , the leaves had long since scattered to the wind , and yet there Lyd sat hour after hour trying to regather them in . And her own family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orphan , had no idea who her people were . All those names on her charts , all those connections , and she did n't fit in on any . I watched her a minute , then cleared my throat . " I 'm going out blueberrying , " I said . Lydia flipped some pages in a ledger , wrote furiously on her pad . She could go on that way for hours , seemed hardly aware there were blood ties in the present , not just the past . The good thing about it was she did n't care where in hell I went  --  most of the time anyway . It was the usual short walk to the Culbertsons ' , but I had to knock on the screen a long time before Anya answered . She had a pencil stuck behind her ear , glasses on . " I thought with the rain we would n't go , " she said . " I was so disappointed , but then I started writing ? " " What rain ? " I said . Right on cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cloaking her shoulders in brightness the same way the first night they 'd been cloaked in dark . But what was funny , and what I could see plain , was that she struggled against it , all but made a pushing motion with her hands to ward the sunlight off . I did n't understand that gesture , not until later . She really had been looking forward to going , felt cheated when  | poured , forced herself to concentrate on work . She 'd n disappointed so much in life , in big things and small , hated to set herself up for a fresh dose . Sunny days ing to rain were fine with her , but rainy days brightento sun ? Like a lot of strong souls she could face the truth when it was bad , but had no idea what to do with it en it was good . I looked at her pretty hard , trying to suggest if she did n't it would be my disappointment we 'd have to deal with , and I guess that tipped the balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in different clothes . There on her baid was a floppy digger hat she 'd gotten in Australia , and lower down was a short-sleeved cotton shirt , color of peach , and below that . . . " I do n't know about those shorts , " I said . " Some pretty Sharp thorns on the way up there . " She looked down at her legs like they were tools , albeit nifty tan ones . " Oh they 're awfully tough , " she said . " And ook . New boots ! " We cut through the meadow toward Empty Ore Hill . Right away Anya wanted to know about the name . Folks in the old days thought the knob up on top was gold or maybe emeralds  --  the way it shone in the sun . Between the dan-r of Indians , the work they had clearing the fields , it was long time before anyone climbed it to find out  --  and hen they discovered nothing more precious than granite , the mountain had its name . She asked a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the meadow and why had no one cut them ? What left the groove marks in the old maples on the field 's edge ? Barbed wire ? Well then , who had torn the wire down ? Whose feet had worn the trail in the side of the mountain ? Where had all the farmers who once lived here gone ?  | Most of the answers took time , but she was impatient , would hardly let me finish  --  she was always in a rush . She walked awfully fast , too , even on the steepest parts , so it was all I could do to keep up , me who 'd been walking mountains all my life . We were up into the berries now , bushes everywhere . Past the summit the granite breaks apart into a plateau of boulders . Each one is like a big reflector oven , keeping those bushes nice and warm , so they flourish there long before anywhere else . " Pick from the south side ! " I shouted as Anya started off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up . " If you ever picked berries you know how absorbed you can get . It 's hot work , too , and after a few minutes I took off my shirt . Anya kept wandering off , but then I 'd see her floppy brown hat bobbing up and down over the highest bushes , and we 'd slowly work our way back to each other , compare results . We must have picked  --  oh , maybe an hour before we took a break . I was tired out from answering all her questions , but I tried my best to name all the peaks . Liberty and Flume were straight across the horizon from us , two matching pyramids , then Lincoln and Haystack to their left in the north , Lafayette bulky in the distance , smaller Garfield peeking over its shoulder . The cold front had brought in some high windy cumulus , and their shadows kept brushing against the slopes , so it seemed the mountains were streaming to the east in the wind , racing each other like horses on a carousel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking she was following everything I said , but then I happened to look over and there she was with her knees tucked in close to her chest , staring at me like she 'd been studying me all along .  | " Max talks about you a lot , " she said . " Max is a fine man . " " Your eyes are like his . Eyes that look polished . Longge eyes . You should be in a seeing contest , the two of ti standing on a rock . " " Well , there 's an awful lot to see . " This was out of habit , staring right at her eyes . What 's nny is until then I 'd been shy of looking at her , me who d never been shy of that particular thing before . " Max would win , " Anya said , serious now . " He sees never . There 's a person in the way , he sees right through em . You know what his favorite word is ? Beyond . Your es would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try seeing them fully . " She tilted her head to the side . wonder what your wife is like . Lydia , is n't that right ? " The moment it came out she must have realized it was o wrong subject . Oh , her lips seemed to say , then we sat ere silent for a while . " ( : an I ask you another question ? " she said . " How come u only pick berries from the lower part of the bushes , ver the top ? " I laughed . " Because they taste better ! " " You expect me to believe that ? " " Yep . Sweeter and juicer . " " Close your eyes . " " My eyes ? " " Lay back and close them ! " I closed them , but it was n't good enough for her  --  she ut her hand under my chin , tilted it up until it was at the ght angle . " Now do n't move , " she said . I heard a rustling oise up past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay . Keep your eyes closed and open your mouth . Which rt of the bush did this come from ? "  | There was a soft tart something on my tongue . " High , " I said , without hesitation . " You guessed ! " " Try me again . " " Close your eyes . " " High . Too bitter . " " Cheater ! You peeked . Again ! " " Sweeter . Low . " " Again ! " " Low . Low . High . . . Middle . " I could have done that forever , her leaning over dropping berries on my tongue , but then the intervals she was away finding new ones grew longer , and after a few minutes I took a chance and opened my eyes . She sat there where the knob fell away , staring out at something I could n't see , though I saw her expression clear enough , what there was of it . It was the kind of expression comes over someo-ne 's face when they 're alone , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too still . Her eyes were open wide , too wide . The tension in her neck was gone , but her alertness was gone with it , so she seemed an entirely different person . All in all , the loneliest sort of posture I ever saw in any-one  --  and that 's saying something . With any other woman I would have known what to do about that look , but with Anya ? I closed my eyes to it , lay back on the rough cushion of the bushes , tried napping . And maybe I did nap , the rocks were so warm . When I opened my eyes again she was still there , only now she was back to her normal self , grinning , pulling her shirt up out of her shorts , tying the tails up high so it became like a halter . There were still a bunch of berries by my side , the ones she had n't gotten around to testing me with . I grabbed a handful and tossed them shotgun style in her direction .  | ones ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a pretty good war of it there . We kept tossing cries at each other , handful after handful , ducking , Ind ; around for more ammunition , running and laugh- ( 1 dodging all the way back to the meadow , like the really had us now , tumbling us downhill like two y kids . I was on Sunday . On Friday I had a note from Max g he would n't be up for another week , asking me to all eye out on Anya for him . I kept dreaming up s to go over , not that I needed any , then talked f out of it . Every night I walked to the rise in the stared through the dark toward the Culbertson place , had that small flickering light until it went out , thinkabout a lot of things , but other than that I kept myself at least tried to . One afternoon I drove down to the e to fetch some nails , and who did I run into by the office but Anya , looking even prettier and happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ? " she asked . Teasing , but I could tell she was hurt . Its been busy , " I told her . " Busier than hell . " he could see right through that of course . Through that what , that was the question . But just then something light both our attentions off to the right behind her car . It Nancy Paronto in a swimsuit and sandals , toting a bag groceries , stopping to wave . What was between us had ded years before , but even so she waved in a certain tah-tah kind of way Anya was n't slow in recognizing . Shegot all girlish with that , tilted her head to the side as if to My , , are n't I that pretty , too ? " A friend of yours ? " she asked .  | " Oh , I 've got lots of friends . " " Does she live around here ? " " Nope . Well , maybe . Up in the hills somewhere prob-ably . " It was like being back in school , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like that , tossing back her hair , and there Nancy is walking slow and lazy back to her car , peeking over her bare suntanned shoulder to make sure I was watching . It gave me even more to think about than I already had . Next day Anya tried getting me on the phone , reached Lydia instead . " Your woman wants you , " Lyd said when I came in . " What are you talking about ? " She pursed her lips together in the sarcastic way only she could manage , made the words come out sounding like poison . " She wants her pipes fixed . " I 'd been in too many real fights with her to get into one without reason , so it was the following day before I went over . Parked out in front was Rob Titcomb 's plumbing truck  --  I could hear him hammering away in the cellar . Well that 's that , I told myself . I was just turning to go when Anya came running out the door , smiling from ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before I could apologize . " He just called from Washington . Tomorrow afternoon ! " It was impossible not to smile along with her , she was so happy . She had already picked some lupine to decorate the house , and when I left she was going back to the garden for more . Next afternoon I was out sawing lumber when a gray Volkswagen pulled up , and out of it , like a giant emerging from a nutshell , came Max . He looked tired , which I put down to the drive ; haggard , which was more of a mystery .  | There were circles under his eyes , or at least the beginnings of circles . It was like someone had dusted them with charcoal . Still , he gave me his usual handshake . He looked toward the mountains , stretched like it was good to be there . " How 's Anya ? " he asked . That surprised me . " You mean you have n't seen her yet ? " " I thought I 'd stop here first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the barn I 'll give you something that will stretch out those kinks . " " Your own brew ? " Max laughed , so for a moment he was like his old self . We went around to the barn , I took out a couple of camp stools , we sat there facing Hogback , talking like . . . well , I wo n't say like old times , because it was n't . It seemed odd him being there out of primary season , not to see him with a pad on his lap , odd to have him do all the talking . I felt shy with him , too , guilty about something I had no cause to be guilty about . For his part he seemed preoccupied . He kept glancing down at his watch the whole time he talked . It was about Vietnam mostly . He 'd been writing columns against the war for nine lonely months , long before anyone else . Here I 'd always assumed what he wrote about was like the work someone did in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose . Hearing his anger pour out , seeing the way he sat there , those huge hands helpless between his knees , I realized it was just the opposite . All this political talk was real for Max . He suffered for America , bled for it , and to see it commit suicide right in front of his eyes . . . " Well , you have the whole summer to forget about that stuff , " I said . " Yeah , " he nodded , without much conviction .  | " Have another swallow ? " He glanced at his watch . " No thanks . " " You 're not going already ! " Max could do that to you  --  up and leave in the middle of a conversation . He was a driven man , at least in those days , and it could be goddam irritating to be caught in the backwash . But then Anya was waiting for him . I guess I could understand his hurry after all . " You come over for dinner tomorrow , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house . " Would your wife like to come ? " " I 'll be alone . " He nodded  --  whatever else you say about him , Max is a man of the world . " Come at five then . And thanks for the drink . " I took Jordan fishing that night on Upper Jubal Pond , and it was pretty late when we got home . I sent him off to bed , walked back to the road and on up the rise to stare toward the Culbertsons ' . No candle burned this time . The house was all lit up , lights on in every room , blazing away in full wattage like there was a party going , a regular ball . . . and the strange thing was the brightness seemed a hell of a lot lonelier than the candle , and it kept me awake all night wondering why that was so . Next day around five I walked over to the house . Anya 's station wagon was still in the driveway , but there was no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it look like the house had been caught beneath an avalanche of lupine , but they seemed forlorn somehow , limp , already losing their color . So I was on the alert , right from the moment I got there . " Hello ? " I called , like I had that first night . And that 's where I finally found her , around in back on  | that little patch of lawn , staring down toward the birch and the small pond . She was dressed beautifully , in a silky summer dress that was peach colored , her favorite , cut low on her shoulders which were brown and soft looking and small . " Max is gone , " she said , without turning . " Gone ? " I had no idea what she meant . " You mean down to the store ? He should have called me . " And now she did turn  --  and I wished she had n't , because on her face was the same expression I 'd seen when I glanced over at her during our blueberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pure on anyone else 's face , as if her muscles were so arranged that , give them one moment of sadness , they totally collapsed . " He 's gone to Vietnam . He 's gone to Vietnam to bring hack the truth , rescue his country . I made him choose between America and me , and it was the easiest decision he ever made . " What was terrible was she smiled when she said all this , tried making it a joke . " We talked it over while we were weeding . Like two reasonable adults  --  is n't that the phrase ? I Ice felt he was neglecting his duty as a journalist being up here . We decided it was best if he left immediately , got the first plane to San Francisco . Max is always searching for the hard things in life . A man leaving for war  --  that 's the hardest thing of all , is n't it ? But it 's Max through and through . He sees things differently than anyone else . He wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' ' hen she said something much softer , staring right at the garden this time , talking to herself alone . " But it 's my fault , not his . I threatened him with happiness and that 's not fair . " Did she say anything else after that ? I 'm not sure , not  | about any of those next few moments . There she was on the lawn , a foot away from the gray shadows slanting toward us from the house , looking more alone and more beautiful than anything I 've ever seen in this world , and then the next minute she was crying , real crying , terrible crying , her shoulders bunched with it . . . and even with all her loneliness , all her solitude , that was the last thing I expected , her crying in a way that made something inside me give way , and there 's not another man with an ounce of heart in him who would n't have done what I did then : walk across the lawn and take her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grabbing my own hand , grabbing it hard . And then she said one more thing , one last thing as I led her past the garden toward the meadow , whispered this time , like a rule I had to understand and accept before time could tick off even one moment more . " I love him . Love him so desperately still . " Almost immediately came a wall we had to cross , and though I helped her , she hesitated for a moment on top , put her hand against her forehead like her balance was centered there , not in her feet . There was a reckless side to her , the dangerous kind of recklessness that comes after great disappointment  --  a willingness to let the chips fall where they might . I 'd seen it before in others , it was why the steadiest and most self-controlled often tumbled farthest , and yet I was too caught up in what was happening in my own heart not to let her fall into it , not to keep on . I led her through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juniper that fanned apart in green chevrons , the young birch that was just high enough to be white now , the wild rose and raspberry . . . past these to where the meadow grass grew taller , so we were wading more than walking , me swinging my arm in front of us to make it give way . On the edge were some white pine , big ones that  | thered and trapped the richest part of the sun so their ranches were like a border separating afternoon and dusk . We pushed our way through , me still holding her hand , and then we were into the woods on a path just distinct ( ) ugh to follow . We walked a long way and yet never ce did she falter  --  if anything , the further we walked , he more trust she put in my hand . Up over a small rise , the pines giving way to hardwood , then back down along a brook hardly big enough to whisper , across it balancing on fallen log , then onto a damp woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but invisible seam . " Feel the air change ? " I asked . " The coolness ? In the old ys they thought the hills were healthier . The fertile land was back by the river , but they wanted to be high , out of the dampness . Where they came from was flat , so they did n't know about shadows , how a mountain could steal the sun , what darkness could do to you in the course of a winter . Watch now . The walls are ahead of us under those leaves . " Anya looked up at me for the first time since I 'd taken her hand . What ? she asked with her eyes  --  there were still few minutes left when she seemed dazed , not herself . But least some of her curiosity was back now ; she seemed to collect herself , began shivering in the coolness of those allows , so I slipped my jacket off and draped it around or shoulders . No hunters would have any reason to come back here ? the best deer yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fishermen ? Nope , the brook 's too small . This could n't be more lost if it had been deliberately hidden . . . See ? Over beyond the wall , then back the other way . . . I was loft alone a lot as a boy  --  that 's when I got in the habit of wandering the woods . I made a lot of discoveries , but this was my greatest . . . Look down beneath those vines . Underneath where they form the canopy . "  | We stood right above it , but even so it was a long minute before Anya realized what she was looking at . A hole of some kind , that was easy , even with it brim full of raspberry canes and thistles . A rectangular hole  --  that was n't hard to see either , once you focused back . No , the hard part was connecting this to something human , the shape of it was so natural , the stones blended so well with the earth . " It 's a cellar hole , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's solved a puzzle . I nodded . " For a barn , a small one . The house was a little further ahead . " The path was drier here , wide enough to suggest a road . On the left was a big apple tree , bigger than anything we had out in the meadows , a Porter , its branches tipping out in little spikes , its leaves all but mummified , and yet it was alive , still growing , still ticking off the years . " I used to picture Iroquois bastards hiding behind this wall  --  it was always a terrible moment until I got past . The next hole should be right about . . . there . See how much smaller than for the barn ? Those dead birch would have started growing the summer after the roof caved in . The birch get in , then the pines , then the frost starts working on the foundation stones . The main village is up ahead . They came here from Connecticut in seventeen eighty-nine , just after the fighting ended . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land rush for a while . " The road climbed , then leveled off in a flatter space , a terrace set against the hill . The cellar holes became regular now , one after the other  --  six on one side of the road , seven on the other , just the way I remembered . The bigger ones were at the end of this row , and they ended at the largest : a rectangle that was a good twenty yards across . This would have been the meeting house . The granite foundation stones were much thicker than for any of the  | houses , and you could picture them rising up higher , supporting more weight . The last time I 'd been there the hole was full of chokecherry , but the wind had brought most of them down , making it look like the nest of a giant bird . " The eighteen twenties was its heyday , " I said , sitting down on the wall , brushing off a space for Anya . " Sheep raising was the big thing . That circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wolves at night . That lasted  --  oh , maybe forty years , before people started moving west . By the Civil War most of the able-bodied men had left . Most of the women moved down to the bigger farms ? as servants first , then as wives . Some moved down to the textile mills in Massachusetts . The end came pretty fast after that . " Anya stared up the road with her eyes wider than I 'd ever seen them ; as hard as it was to capture the mood , she had sensed it right away . " It 's wonderful , " she said  --  out loud I think , or maybe I was still reading her eyes . She took my arm . " How often do you come ? " " Not in twenty years . I came all the time as a kid . Exploring , getting to know it , trying to figure out who the people were , doing some housekeeping . " She seemed surprised , even shocked . " Not in twenty years ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't told Lyd about the village , thought I 'd save it for a surprise . We only got halfway . She had a blister and demanded we go chick . " I looked over at her , then shrugged . " That was the last time . " We were quiet for a while . " Does it have a name ? " she asked . " Oh , I suppose . I 'm not sure though . " " You 're lying . Of course it had a name . "  | " Well , " I mumbled . " They were different than us . It was a hopeful race . " " And so they named it ? " " Eden . They named it Eden , New Hampshire . " Anya nodded , staring toward the cellar holes like she saw them even better now . " A village on the hill , " she said . " A perfect village on a hill . " " They wanted to be away from goddam small things , to start a new life in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Too hard . " " You ca n't blame them for wanting to be where it was easier . Hell , I 'd do the same thing myself . " " But for a moment they had it , did n't they ? For one brief moment it was here . " She looked down at the wall , rubbed it just like a woman would rub a diamond , something precious . " Did you ever find anything ? Besides the holes and the rocks ? " I laughed . " Buttons ! Oh how they loved buttons ! " " Do you still have any ? " " I took them all home , kept them in a box , but then I got to thinking and I brought them back . Scattered them in the holes where they belonged . But there was plenty more there . Ladles . Pewter mugs . That brown Stoddard glass they favored . The best thing was a box made out of teak . " " Just a box ? " " It 's what was inside . A daguerreotype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worn in lockets . It was of a man , a young one looking toward the camera stiff and scared . . . Feel like walking more ? I 'll show you just where I found it . The old road climbed toward the meeting house , then branched off uphill . The pines had n't been cut there , not in a hundred years , and you had to crane back your head to see their tops . A half mile of those and we came to another  | changed over to ferns  --  the cinnamon kind , those soft greens and browns . " You look under those shingles you 'll see some charred beams , or at least pieces of beams . The other houses collapsed with age , but this one burned down . Thirty years ago , when it rained , you c could still smell carbon on the bricks . " I had to walk around the circumference once , squinting , then I pointed . " There . I found the box with the picture there . " " Under the ivy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure , not at first For three years it just lay in my drawer , but then curios ity got the better of me . I took the locket over to Glencliff , the old folks ' home , showed it around asking everyone if - they recognized who the man was . " Anya tipped her head in her curious way , brushed the hair back out of her eyes . " And you found someone who did ? " " There was one woman . Oh , I want to say she was ninety , but probably she was older . old enough to remember seeing turkeys driven to market in flocks , each with a little bell . Mrs. Dimick was her name , and she told me a story about when she was a girl . This was in IDixford , other side of the mountain . Once a month on Sunday an old woman would walk into town , carrying a satch  --  l on a pole just like a hobo . She would buy some seeds , some patent medicine and a bag of penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start back into the woods . But what Mrs. Dimick remembered about her was this . The old woman wore boots to town , thick hobnails , but the minute she got there she would take them off , put on delicate black shoes , those patentleather kind fastened with buttons , and proceed to walk up and down the street like a regular lady . "  | " And that was the woman who lived here ? " " This carries us all the way back to eighteen seventy or thereabouts . After I heard her tell the story , I realized everything fit . " We had worked our way around the cellar until we were in the corner nearest the road . The fire that destroyed the house must have been hottest there , because nothing grew except sedge grass , parted sideways like someone had taken a comb to it , smoothed it down . Anya sat where it was driest , put her arms around her knees , stared up at me like a regular audience as I began telling her what I knew . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was born with the century , so in 1870 she was seventy years old . As a girl she had been betrothed to a young man of the village  --  the young man staring out from the daguerroetype . Judging by his looks he seemed an average sort , with strength enough in his expression , but an odd shrinking back in the eyes . . . someone who was vaguely scared of life , found life too much for him , would n't stare life too hard in the face . But he had the initiative of his time and place , and so , promising to come back for her as soon as he was settled , he left the village for the west , traveling on foot to Albany , then taking a barge on the Erie Canal . After the pain of their leavetaking , Lily would have been consoled by her family , by the chores that were undoubtedly hers  --  by the hope she would soon be with him . There may have been letters , too  --  long ones at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read out loud , and without the one detail she was waiting for : the date when he would come back to fetch her . Eventually the letters stopped altogether , and then would have come months of puzzlement and worry , of walking alone  | at night , hugging herself , turning over everything they had ever said to each other , every secret moment alone . A man would n't marry in those days unless the woman proved herself fertile . So there was a child involved , though like so many others it may well have died as an infant . There were hardly any babies born in the village anymore . All the young people left , until by the 1860s there would have been no one in the village but Lily and the old ones she took care of as nurse . Soon they died off , too , and only Lily remained  --  old now herself , bent and toughened from a life of labor and care , but still girlish in the essential part of her : her conviction her lover would one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come back , then she must wait for him there by the mountain , maintaining everything just as it was , the road cleared and mended , the walls in good repair , the houses kept intact . Over the years the two tasks merged . . . keeping her love alive , keeping the village ready . . . until it became hard to remember which was which , and the only thing she thought about was taking care of the village , holding the forest back , cutting away the vines . At first , she may have been able to do it , but the winters would have soon caught up with her , the roofs caving in from the weight of the snow , the foundations cracking under the pressure of frost . In time she gave up trying to save any houses in the village but her own ; what strength remained from that went to trying to preserve the meeting house , the place they were to be wed . Even this became too much for her , and soon there was nothing left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk once a month to town , the potatoes she raised in the road where the sun was brightest , the nut gathering , the apples , the bittersweet truce she must have worked out in time with the mountain at her back .  | Had she seen her betrothed at the end after all ? Had fate been kind enough to give her the illusion just as she died ? The roof burned down sometime around 1880 , and there would have been nothing to stop the snow from gathering around her in her final sleep . " There 's a cemetery up behind the meeting house . Twenty-five stones , most of which are fallen over . A lot of Pipers are lying up there , the last one buried in 1861 . None of the stones has her name on it . I suspect she was sitting here holding the box with his daguerreotype when she died . " And it was strange , but as soon as I finished I decided I 'd told it wrong , lost Anya 's attention . During the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , stood there staring down at the vines , absent-mindedly plucking at their edges . Now , with my voice gone , there was nothing at all . Maybe a warbler singing with the dusk ; maybe a breeze up there in the pines , but neither strong enough to touch us . She mumbled something , too soft for me to hear . " I 'm sorry Anya ? " " No one remembers this village . No one remembers her . Except you . " " And now you , " I said , just as softly . " When you forget , this will die . Her love will finally die . " " I do n't intend to forget . " Maybe I said this too low , because she did n't seem to hear . It was late enough now that the sunlight was gone from the cellar , and she stood in what soft brown remained , making that same lonely plucking motion at the vines . I remember her shivering , too . Even with my jacket around her shoulders she was shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away when I was  | younger . I thought I 'd keep the village preserved on my own , force the forest back . I brought a ripsaw up here , chopped and sawed until I was exhausted . But it 's impossible . Three rainy days and it all grows over . Foolish to even try . " Seeing her shiver make me walk over to her , but then I was close enough to see she was n't shivering at all  --  that what I read for that , hidden by my jacket , was her tearing furiously at the vines , trying to pull them back from the foundation . Her bare arms were plunged deep in the thickest tangles  --  they were already scratched from the stickers . A coil of vine fell around her shoulder , seemed to embrace her , made her beat at it until it dropped away onto the other coils , thickening them , making it worse . The vines , the stickers , the young shoots of trees . She pulled frantically , passionately , as if everything depended on clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her shoulders , but she pulled away from me , fought back to the wall , and then just as suddenly gave up completely , turned from the vines with as much passion as she had torn at them with  --  turned to stare at me with a look I could spend a hundred years trying to describe and never capture . There were tears under her eyes , a yearning that could have been read a dozen ways , a girlish helplessness , and then something a hundred times stronger , coloring her face . With other women I was always so aware of crossing over into something deeper , and yet with Anya it was just the opposite , we came together as a step back from something that was too goddam deep to face alone . Yes , I was aware of that , even then , and then nothing but wanting to simplify things . . . the jacket off her shoulders , the straps of her dress down , my head to her breasts , my hand on the small of her back . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ard , and in the one instant of clarity left to me I remember inking  --  Well , Ferris . Everything in life has been a rehearsal for this moment and this moment alone . We lay on the sedge grass , in the shelter of the old foundation and the rich smell of moss , her back making the allow blades spread apart so we were cushioned , partly vered . Her hair , as I spread it , became mixed with small wildflowers I had n't seen from higher up , little red ones d starry blue ones , clover sized , damp , and then her nd was back amidst them , tossing them , tossing them rhythmically , so they spread apart , too , and I pressed my eyes down into their petals , pressing deeper , closing my as , the two of us together in the only space left for us be . . . and then though I wanted to scream from the ortness of it , we were coming back again . . . I opened y eyes to the flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching at the flowers , then relaxing , ying still . But I remember . Thirty years later I still remember . How quiet she was then and later ; everything , all passion , all light , had to be absorbed by her , taken in deeply , held . ret even from the person who found them with her . ow I dressed her again as carefully and tenderly as I d undressed her in what already seemed the distant past . . . her taking the flowers from my hair . . . climbing again out of the cellar . . . crossing the wall . . . the o of us walking down the village lane in the darkness nd in hand . . . the curious , sheltering sounds of the ght woods . . . coming again to the meadow and a sea stars . They were so bright after the darkness Anya put her m over her eyes  --  I even squinted myself . The way the endow rolls there you can see the curve of the earth , at least in daylight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-  | ing on the edge of the planet with nothing in front of you but space , one clumsy move and over you fall . So we did n't let go of each other , not yet . The back of the meadow is tipped up high like the side of an amphitheater , and that 's where we finally sat down , staring out toward where the stars were thickest . " Are they always like this ? " Anya asked at last . " Once a summer , " I said . Then I looked over at her . " Hell , once a century . " I kissed her  --  not like before , but shyly on the cheek , like it was the first kiss I 'd ever gotten up the nerve for . But she understood . She took my arm and pulled herself closer . " What 's that one right overhead ? " she asked , her head on my lap , staring up . " Vega . Everyone knows Vega . " " Not me . " " The Lyre . Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move toward the west . You do n't hear that sound very often either . Maybe twice a summer . " " Only twice ? " She said it so softly , with so much disappointment , I hugged her just to show I was teasing . But it was funny about her not knowing Vega or many of the others . She was always so busy staring down into the sea on her expeditions , she never bothered looking up , or did it quickly , seeing the beauty , not wanting it named . But she wanted them named now . I could hardly keep up , she pointed so fast . Cygnus the Swan , the bright northern cross . The Great Bear , of course , and the little one , too , Ursa Minor , which shines brighter here than anywhere . There was Altair , friendly looking and steady , and then way to the south where the earth fell away came Scorpius and bright Centaurus , and thousands more , constellations and nebulae and gassy clouds so thick you could hardly  | find black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Shooting stars , too , a whole salute of them , making our necks sore from trying to follow their arcs ? spectacular , a show just for us , but nothing compared to what was shooting through my heart . It was a long lesson and it needed more than one night . We always went to the meadow at dusk , never again to the hidden village . I found a picnic hamper in the barn  --  Anya used it to carry back wildflowers and berries we picked before the light disappeared . She brought a quilt , but we never lay on it , but rolled it up under our heads for a pillow . We lay in the same place , holding each other , waiting for darkness to settle , aware of the edge there before us , but safely back from it , in a good position to watch . " You missed one , " she said that first night . " That yellow one , the brightest of all . " I slapped my forehead . " Goddam ! I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's setting . So low now . " " They seem to go faster once they pass overhead . But it 's In no hurry . " " Let 's stay until Arcturus sets , " she said , nodding . " Hold me and we 'll watch . " And that became the clock that ruled our nights . By the time it became dark enough to see , Arcturus would be right overhead , with half the sky still in front of it , but each night it would appear a little past that , dropping lower to the west , the air getting cooler , damper , so by the time it disappeared we would both be shivering , shivering with a lot of things , and I would help her up and together we would walk slowly back . After that first night it was Anya who supplied what little talking we needed . She told me stories about the seas the knew , trading them back to me for the stars  --  stories  | about her trips , what she had seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their chemistry but their mood . I 'm not sure why , I suppose because it 's so distant , but the one I enjoyed hearing her talk about most was the Pacific . " The name is wrong to begin with , " she explained . " It 's stormy , not pacific at all . It 's the only one I 've been seasick on . Cold , too , so much of it . But catch it on the right day , it seems like a sea spun out of an exquisite silk  --  miles and miles of it , like the earth were a loom spinning it out for no other reason than to show off what it can do in the way of beauty . " " You say that word a lot . Beauty . You always say it with the same expression , defiant , like you think someone is going to snatch it away . " She did n't smile . " I do ? No one ever tells me how I look . Beauty ? Now you mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I pulled her closer . " Talk more . " One night , maybe the third or fourth we were together , she was describing the sea off Alaska , telling me about her expedition there the previous summer . I 'm not the kind that falls asleep afterwards , but I was drowsy in the contented way that only comes then , so I lost some of her words . When I did start listening again the words were all wrong somehow , with nothing linking them to the ones on the other side of my lapse . " There was never that darkness before , " she said , staring down toward her arm , mumbling like something bitter was on her tongue . " No sign from beneath , no surge , no current to read . A surface under orders from something invisible and deep . " " What sea is that ? " I asked , puzzled . She did n't answer , not directly . Instead , laying back against the quilt , she told me a story about when she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore . Her parents were both in institutions , her maiden aunts hardly spoke to her , and it was n't until she was almost sixteen that she met someone who recognized and encouraged her talent  --  a friend of the family named Sarah who taught at a ritzy girls ' school in Connecticut . Sarah was twenty-nine . Intelligent , beautiful , athletic enough to have been in the Olympics as a skater , she was everything Anya herself dreamed of becoming . She all but adopted Anya , enrolling her in the girls ' school , having her spend vacations at her summer house up in Maine , paying , when it came time , for a college education , encouraging her love of the ocean in every way possible . And then , with no inkling of this beforehand , one weekend in Maine the lovely and mysterious Sarah made it quite clear what she wanted in return . Anya , confused , hardly knowing what she meant , thought at first she must by joking . But no  --  later that night , alone during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her room holding a kerosene lamp , and as Anya watched , mystified and frightened , slowly removed her robe and came over to the bed . " She was so beautiful , standing naked in the soft light , and yet it frightened me so much I nearly screamed . Here was the woman who meant more to me than anyone , and yet suddenly she was a stranger . It was like there were two people in the room , one I wanted to hug with all my might , the other I wanted to run from . . . But she was very understanding , very gentle even then . We 'll talk about it tomorrow , ' she said when she saw how frightened I was . She leaned over and kissed my hair like she did every night , and then she was gone . . . . Next day I woke up late , and she was n't there when I went downstairs , just this note saying she 'd gone to town for bread . An hour later 103  | the local police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit by a teenager 's on a blind curve . Sarah died instantly . " She explained how difficult it had been in the months that followed to work through the tortured mix of emotions . . . how heartbroken she was , and yet , at the very bottom where she hardly dared look , how relieved . . . until at last , when all the sadness and guilt had left , the shock of having something precious taken away , taken twice , only one thing remained : the determination never to let fate get ahead of her again . As I listened I kept trying to understand , not only what had happened to her , but why she chose this moment to explain . So I would understand what had put the stiffness in her shoulders ? Understand where that look came from , the one when her face went lifeless ? Understand , hardest of all , why she put a clock on our love even when it was fiercest ? " Do n't be sad for me , " she said , misreading my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your turn now . Tell me which star is that . " Anya learned fast , she knew all the stars ' names before long , but me I 'm a slow learner , so it was almost September before I realized what I should have realized all along ? that I was getting a pretty thorough lesson in having my heart broke apart . To Anya it was as if she had pushed herself off into that sky . . . the summer was the great departure every strong soul once deserves . . . but to think it was any more than that , me someone more than the man who let her have it , was craziness , and yet being crazy 's never been enough to keep something from my head . I thought about a lot of impossible things those nights , laying next to her , stroking her hair . I imagined myself being as smart as her , being able to talk about the things she knew . I imagined her deciding to stay on in autumn , not leaving at  | all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high it would flood all the way to the mountains , run on up our hill , make it perfect for her . . . imagined Arcturus freezing t here in the sky , stopping entirely . Oh , I had a whole list of dreams ! What else ? The remorse I felt , the guilt ? I 'd gone too far along that road before to start having compunctions now , even with a friend , but they were there all right , all along t hey were there . Previous times I 'd tell myself the husband was a good-for-nothing dullard who did n't appreciate his wife 's beauty , did n't deserve to lay his paws on it , end up convinced I was performing a public service . But I could n't do that with Max . Unlike with the others , I was jealous of him , knowing he had something of Anya I could never get , not in a million years of trying . She had borrowed my seeing , that was all . We loved the summer and for a while that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , the guilt came later , in never confessing to him . . . not to ask his forgiveness , but to give him some vital information about Anya 's heart , something he should know about her , Max who wants truth more than anything . I almost told him the next time he came , and I almost told him the time after that , but I could never find exactly the right words , and without them I was too cowardly to start . That was my mistake , the sin in it . That and teaching Anya about the toughness of those vines . I should have taken her back to the village , gone equipped with loppers and hatchets and chainsaws and dynamite , hacked those vines away until all their sadness was gone and the cellars stood clear . But I did n't . I did n't and then it was September , Anya was leaving in the morning , and we went to the meadow for what I knew would be our last night alone . It was n't happy , not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so easily , it ending , and she sensed this , so  | there was a brutal wedge between us , even when we held each other close . When Anya convinced herself of something her emotions fell into line  --  she and Max were hard that way , tougher than me , hard . " I 'll come back , " she whispered , as I dressed her . Her eyes were wider than ever before , strained even , like she must force them open so nothing was hid . " I 'll come back one summer to see this again . " " Yeah , " I said , pulling away from her , making my voice as indifferent as I could . " Well , I 'll be out in California by then . " " California ? " " Wiggling my toes in that Pacific of yours . I 'm sick of these winters . " But I could n't fool her , me who fooled so many . " So you 're no Lily Piper then ? " " No . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to kiss you , then I 'm going to walk across the meadow alone . You wait for me here , all right ? One day there will be another summer as perfect as this one and I 'll come back . " That was painful all right , but who knows how painful it was for her , maybe that was her way of making it bearable , so I let her kiss me , felt the chill go right down to my heart , kept myself with the hardest effort of my life from reaching out to stop her , stared up in desperation trying to find Arcturus . . . found it there on the western horizon . smearing itself across the sky under my tears until the entire line seemed yellow , and it was such a lonely color , so beautiful and so bitter , it was too much for me and l could n't watch alone . " Anya ? " I whispered . There was nothing . " Anya ? " I said , louder .  | Nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming as though if I yelled with enough power I could bring the yellow tick , reform it into a pinpoint , place the point high in e sky , hang it motionless . . . yelling myself hoarse , sobbing . . . and for all the noise I made I could have been hispering , there was no difference . And there was nothin-g to do then except pick up the quilt we had laid on , shake the grass off , walk back through the meadow lone . . . back past the Culbertson 's where no light hone , back to our road with the owls , back to the house old in sullenness . . . back to the long years waiting for me there . . . to being an oracle , to fooling the world ith my wisdom , me who knows not a goddam thing .  | He took Nathan out to the patio , the sunny side , the place where every morning Marcia tried to coax Devon into talking . There was a table there , two simple chairs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . " Ah ! " Nathan sighed , walking to the edge , spreading his arms apart in approval . " Infinity ! I like that . Uh , can we hear the phone ? " Max nodded . " The window is open . " " I gave Krista your number . Can I be frank ? We were affectionate last night , crazy affectionate . At my age  --  well , she 's worried I 'll keel over from too much love . " " You would have expired years ago . Krista you say ? " Max nodded vigorously enough to shake the loose wattles of his throat . " Home and Foods . I was on my way down to Simon 's office and I stopped in for that streusel recipe they ran last Christmas . She has a way of sitting at her computer terminal . Pensive . No , pert . Pert and pensive . " " Can I ask how old ? " Nathan shrugged . " Twenty-nine . Oh , I know Max ! I know !  | Her father used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had anything to do with her prose style ! It 's like taking credit for her breasts . " None of this was new ; Nathan never hesitated in making a fool of himself , specialized in office romances , seemed happiest when his love was the most impossible . All the other humorists Max knew were sober , even dour men , funny only in their columns , but Nathan was the kind who could have made a name for himself in vaudeville . He had the most expressive face Max had ever seen , his moods pissing across it in ripples . He could wiggle his ears , roll his eyes , do funny things with his teeth . Even his hair contributed . It was still light enough to be called red , the legacy of an Irish grandmother , and it hung to the side like the shaggy mop of a clown . Despite the plasticity , or maybe because of it , his face was webbed with wrinkles , more so than Max 's , though t hey were the same age . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . Ellen , Sarah , April , Shannon . There hardly seemed room for a new one . " You know what I like about her ? " he said , only now sitting down . " Let me guess . " " Well , Max . Let me tell you , Krista does things with her mouth that are beyond words . But vulgarity aside . Her insouciance . She 's no respecter of persons . I 'm too young for sainthood . " " A night away will do you good . Marcia has the guest room all ready . " Nathan hung his head down in a perfect pantomime of guilt . " I ca n't stay . No , there 's no use arguing . We have tickets ! For what I do n't know , but tickets ! I 'm taking the t hree-o'clock flight back . It 's a shame , I know . The sea here  | is so beautiful . It seems closer than last time  --  has it moved ? I remember . . . well , lots of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long , then suddenly brightened . " Did I tell you I 'm suing the paper ? " " No ! " " That fascist health policy . Your cholesterol is below two hundred they give you a bonus . It 's wonderful . I 've been waiting sixty years to be discriminated against , and now here 's my chance . My cholesterol is two-ninety and I 'm proud of it . You know how many steaks it took to get it up to those heights ? How much whipped cream ? My lawyer serves the papers tomorrow . " The thermos was bright enough to catch the sun , make them squint ; Max reached over to move it aside . " What does Simon think about that ? " " Nothing . He 's too busy worrying about you . " That was Nathan 's other trick : just when you started to fall into his mood , take him lightly , he thrust in his point , thrust it in hard . " I thought we had all that settled , " Max said , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a date . I 'm not a fucking beginner . " " You do n't know Simon the way I do . He believes in institutions  --  that why he 's so good for the paper . The Press , the Public , the Nation  --  Max Thomas . Everything comes to him in capital letters . The funny thing is he worries about all of them . If they 're cast in marble , it 's a pretty shaky marble , and he 's always on the lookout for their collapse . " " I 'm not collapsing . " " That 's obvious . " " But it 's why you 've come , correct ? To check for cracks ? " Instead of answering , Nathan took a sip of coffee , let his  | eyes come up from the rim . " You did say we could hear the phone from here ? " " In the kitchen . Marcia 's using the one in my office . " " Marcia ? Working on a new project , is she ? " Peeved , in no mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . Nathan was right about it having moved  --  a storm that weekend had flooded the depressions in the sand , so for a hundred yards back from the tide line there were isolated gray pools , some of great size . A small shape waddled along the edge of one of them , throwing in shells . It looked like a seagull disguised in a baggy sweatshirt , and he had to stare a long time before realizing it was Devon . " Simon 's thinking of starting his own column to replace yours , did you hear ? He thinks we 're all too hard on Israel , and it makes him furious . " Was he safe there alone ? Marcia was going through one of her neglectful periods  --  there was nothing to keep the boy from wading in over his head . Max debated whether to yell for him , call him over . Running , he could certainly get there fast enough if he got into trouble . He seemed so happy with his shells . " There 's a betting line . Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back . " Betting ? " " Everyone has an idea what your last column will be on . It 's gotten ghoulish . Like shoving a tape recorder down a ( lying man 's throat . Open wider ! Wider damn you ! " Nathan pantomimed a shoving motion , pressed the heel of his hand down on the table , then laughed in the way only he could , belly to forehead , everything shaking , so Max half-expected him to be elevated up out of his chair from sheer momentum . He did n't laugh often , which was a  | pity , because it seemed the only thing that fully relaxed him . But it was much better now . They looked at each other , and whatever tension had been between them was gone . " Well Max , " he said , spreading his arms apart the war he had when first seeing the ocean . " What 's it going to be ? " Max shook his head . " Damned if I know , Nathan . This is a tough one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberties once taken for granted . Metal detectors everywhere . Private security guards more numerous than police etcet-era . " " Did it last year . " " Fascist undertone ? Blue-collar types snookered by rightwing messiah into a crusade against the outcasts and poor ? I 'm serious , too . There 's some assholic jerk right now working in a hick TV station somewhere , perfecting his pitch in the minors until it 's ready for the big time . He 's going to make all the sons-of-bitches we 've seen so far seem like amateurs . " " Shrill , but a possibility . " " Fundamental immaturity in American character ? Inanities of popular culture , artistic burn-out at thirty , our love affair with guns ? " " Also a possibility . " " Predict the future ? Max Thomas looks at the next century and sees ? And sees ? Uh , what are you seeing , Max ? " " To go along with my other successes ? You 're talking to the man who predicted a single world government by nineteen eighty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nah , too obvious . Like Simon says , something more valedictory . " Nathan put his hand to his chin , squinted up toward the  | verhang of the barn 's roof , as if the answer might be perched ere ready to fall . " You know something , Max . Aside from is temporary block of yours , I envy you . Always have . " " Now Nathan . " " Pulitzers ? They 're a dime a dozen . Why they even let e have one once . Fame ? I 've had my ten minutes ' worth . o , it 's all the people you 've destroyed . I envy you that . our career is littered with corpses  --  it 's like some chamion of old who fought the good fight and left the ground trewn with dragons . " " St. George ? I think not . " " Let me finish . It 's how you killed them that makes me alous . Maliciously ? No . Deliberately ? Harder to say . But e weapon of choice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wrote came with a resigned shrug of the shoulders . That 's the secret of Max Thomas . " Max knew what was coming now ; each time they talked Nathan prefaced it a different way , but always managed to come around to the same subject . His expression , too . With the brightness gone , every wrinkle softened and sagged , turning his face into a caricature of sadness . " Me , I never hurt anyone . Make fun of them , mock them , sure , but wound them , wound mortally ? Nah , it was never permitted . All the bastards I laughed at , all the pretensions I pricked . And where did it get me ? Got to be an honor to be laughed at in my column , an actual honor ! I legitimatized them , Max . I goddam legitimatized them ! " " You 're exaggerating . " But that was the wrong thing to say . " Bullshit ! All the crap that 's gone down in the last fifty years , and what did I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people laugh at it rather than get angry . Foster Dulles , McCarthy , that idiot Kissinger , Reagan  --  the whole wretched parade . I served as their light-  | ning rod , and listen Max , it was the worst thing I could have done . " He threw up his hands , held them high over his head as if surrendering . " But you know what ? It 's not over yet . Retirement is coming . Someday I 'll write a last column , too . And I 'm not lying , Max . I 've got inside information same as you , and this time I 'm not sitting on it . I think about it constantly . I 'm going to write one last column and take a bastard with me and my only hope is that George Bush lives for three and a half more years . " There was more . . . Nathan always liked to pick at the same sore . . . but Max knew from experience there was little he could do but hear him out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make people laugh , that was the way it had always been , and there was something suspiciously ritualistic about Nathan 's lament . That he was someone who when it came to politics found it hard to be funny , had to work at it  --  that at bottom he was an extremely bitter man . . . Well , there was nothing new here either , and as much as he loved Nathan he found this part of him hard to take . But it never lasted long . Like every other columnist Max knew , Nathan was constantly editing things in his head , pruning , very aware of the word count , afraid to go past his allotted quota . So he waited him out , looked toward the beach , tried locating Devon in the expanse of sand . He was still walking along the flooded depressions , but this time on the house side , closer . He had obviously spotted the two of them on the patio ; his shell tossing was more exaggerated now , his body coiled into each toss like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone ? "  | " Those chimes ? Ship 's clock . " Nathan fanned his face . " I feel tense when I get too far from her . Post-coital depression ? With her I have it constantly . But look here now . How 's about we collaborate ? One of those great imaginary turning points in history you specialize in . Headlines , a whole series of them . Congress votes itself pay reduction ! General Motors renounces greed as a corporate policy ! Pentagon admits mistake ! " Max laughed . " It 's been done . It 's all been done . " " Well then there 's nothing for it but the big one . " " Do I sense a straight line ? Okay , I 'll bite . Big one what ? " " The Big A. America . These Lonely States of America . You 've got to end with something profound on that . " Max reached for his coffee , poured them each a fresh cup . " As if I had n't had my say . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You might be surprised at what came out . Hell , I might he surprised at what comes out . You want to know the truth ? " " The weary truth ? " " I no longer believe in America . As a concept it makes no sense . " " You 're telling me this ? " " It 's like your cholesterol and all the steaks that went into it . You know how many years it took for the concept to form , the concept of America as something unique ? The effort behind it ? The Madisons and de Tocquevilles , the Whitmans and Twains , Henry Adams and Thorstein Veblen , muckrakers like Ida Tarbell , Mencken down there in Baltimore , the Lippmanns and the Kennans ? And that 's just for starters . The Puritans , the Transcendentalists , all the l Itopians , Bryan and the Progressives , the freedom marchers , even the hippies with all their vanities . Different as  | they were , they all contributed to making the concept mean something , something important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. T. Barnums , Andy Warhols  --  the con men and flimflammers . " " The hard times we 've struggled through , the tragedies big and small  --  the promise ? Well into out third century , you 'd think they 'd add up to something lasting . But somewhere along the way , say thirty years ago , it was n't addition any more in our culture , but subtraction  --  each different voice was chipping something essential away . " The grin nearly split apart Nathan 's face . " Now you 're talking ! " " I mean it . Speaking personally , the hell with the column . I 've spent forty years thinking I had no illusions left about my country , then going on to shed one right after the other . That first time in Vietnam ? I went with no preconceptions , traveled light ready to learn . I made a big mistake right at the start , went out on patrol with a lieutenant and some kids . They were brave and likeable as hell , so that was another illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could always rely on the innate goodness of those kids . But you know something , Nathan ? They did n't know shit . Nothing ! Why they were over there  --  okay , that was impossible for anyone to figure out , me included . But it was like they walked around armored by an ignorance so absolute even shrapnel could n't dent it . They were sleep-walking  --  braver than hell , but asleep . I saw the lieutenant cry because his stereo had been shot . Like their parents at home , they were kids with toys and aspired for nothing except more toys . " " Which you had the guts to say out loud if I remember . And got blasted . " " And got blasted . So , no more illusions for Max Tho-  | was . Turns out American kids can rape and pillage with the best of them . But then I made a second mistake . Went back to Saigon , camped at the Hilton with all the other reporters , did my work there . When the rocket attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes on the atrocities I 'd seen in the villages . Telling it like it was  --  was n't that the phrase ? Then the rockets came in , everything blew apart , lights out , cursing , smell of sewage , plaster dropping , and amid all the chaos do you know what I was conscious of , besides the pain in my head ? I remember thinking now j I could really say something vital about America ; I 'd been knocked so hard on my head all at last would be clear , but then at the same moment realizing there was nothing there . . . good , bad , indifferent . . . nothing . It was like I 'd been struck on exactly the right spot on my skull to cause a particularly selective amnesia . Everything made sense to me except one word : America . The shrapnel had torn that word into ribbons , shredded it right apart . " " Vietnam did that to a lot of people . What , half a million Vietnamese dead ? What did we learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves was spoiled ? " " No  --  do n't accuse me of that . But anyway , forget Vietnam . The concept never did come back to me , not in a way that made sense . Here all my life I 'd been trying to write about America as if it were a person  --  an enormously complex one , true , but a single entity all the same , one who if I studied long enough I 'd understand . But that was sheer i II usion ! A fucking conceit ! Maybe once it made sense , but not any more . Three hundred million of us ! What can you say about three hundred million that holds ? The world 's been in a race toward total confusion , and we 've gotten there first . We 've created the first society you ca n't generalize about except in the smallest , most trivial way . America ? When it comes to writing about America , anything goes . "  | apple tree , smaller than the one back in the village , younger , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked a few steps to the left , kicked through some vines , bent the saplings back  --  stared , nodded , pointed down . " I found it there . " A wooden edge remained along the top of the foundation , jagged shards weathered into a brown the same color as the earth . Shingles , too  --  you could see them on the bottom of the hole in the haphazard , overlapping pattern they had fallen . Along the nearest wall was a pyramid of blackened bricks , showing where the chimney had been before it collapsed . " It 's so far apart from the others , " Anya said . " Why put a house here ? It must have taken stubbornness , an independent streak . " " They could n't have gone much further . Look there . " Beyond the foundation the road ended in a pile of lichencovered boulders  --  not a neat pile as in the stone walls , but a huge jumble , like a barrier someone had done their best to erect . A barrier to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mount Hor . It towered above the forest , its slopes ugly with old landslides and cliffs , its base ringed in black talus that reeked of damp . Some mountains are content where they are , but this one seemed hungry , restless , on the move . As a boy the dark advancing mass of it had scared me like nothing else could , and after getting that far I always turned and ran . I did n't want Anya to stare at this too long , ruin the mood . " Hey ! " I shouted . I spread my arms apart for balance , jumped right through the vines into the hole . Without any hesitation she leaned over and let me boost her down . From the top the vines looked sharp and prickly , but it turned out just the opposite . They were gentle , cushioning even , and toward the corner , as we explored , they
