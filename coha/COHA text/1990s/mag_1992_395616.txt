I assisted in the births , several years apart , of both my daughters . I saw them even before their mother did . I remember the chill and slightly acidic smell of the delivery room , the doctor 's voice and the sound each tiny , curly-haired head made as it came out of their mother 's body . I remember the quickening of my heart as each drew her first breath . The bond I formed with my daughters during those days will never be broken ; we have a special closeness . Some people claim fathers ca n't have that intangible connection that ties children to their mothers . I know that we do . There are times when I can feel my daughters ' presence even when they are miles from me . Even now , as each rushes headlong into womanhood , that closeness exists and colors every decision I make regarding them . My daughters . I see the women in my life when I look at them  --  my wife 's wit , wisdom and quick , warm smile . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination , my mother-in-law 's soft grace . And I see myself  --  the things I 'm most proud of . My daughters are my link to my past , my touch of immortality . I want so much for them : the predictable things like happiness and a destiny free of worry and heartache . I want them to live the dreams I have for them and , more important , those they have for themselves . But I 'm always mindful of dangers and pitfalls . I 'm always fearful of not living up to their expectations of me . Maybe that 's why some fathers leave their children . They ca n't face the pain of disappointing their children and of seeing their failure in the disappointment in their children 's eyes . And there is always the fear of not being able to protect my daughters from things over which I have no control . How do you protect them from a racist , sexist society ? How do you prepare them for the sexual and emotional predators you know lurk beyond the safety of the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fathers are , a daughter 's " first boyfriend . " That means that every man who comes into her life will be measured , for better or for worse , against me . And how a father treats his daughter  --  the lessons , both direct and indirect , that he has taught her  --  will determine her attitudes and behavior toward men . If he pays close attention , he 'll discover that those men can tell him about the kind of man he is . A daughter learns what to expect of men and of sexuality from her father . If a man has cherished his daughter , she will probably choose men who cherish her . But he must also be aware of the boundaries that separate father and daughter . As my teenage daughters grow into women , my behavior toward them has changed . The hugs and squeezes are less tight , and that cozy closeness has become a bit formal . No , the love has n't diminished , but they are young women , and I must respect those unspoken boundaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are personal and sexual boundaries that no one  --  not even a father  --  has the right to cross . And boundaries that are not respected by fathers can be damaging to a woman . I have a friend whose father used to walk around the house nude in front of her and her sister . He saw himself as a " free spirit " who lived with abandon . He considered his au naturel strolls as innocent , cute  --  some 1960 's call to hippie freedom . But it was a brutal transgression of that boundary that fathers must respect . It took my friend years to learn to trust men in relationships . She viewed them as threatening and unpredictable , as denigrators of her personhood  --  her emotional boundaries . I think there is a natural pulling away between daughters and fathers at a certain age . The affection and hugs my daughters once expected from me are now given by boyfriends ; they will be given someday by husbands . And if a father is lucky , those boyfriends and husbands will be men he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become women , it 's payback time for fathers . All of our dirty " teenage boy " deeds vis-a-vis teenage girls come back to haunt us . Royally . All of us remember being teenage boys . I certainly can . When I was a teen , my universe was defined by my cutbuddies , sports , music , movies and girls  --  especially girls . Everything we did and were about had at its core the conquest of girls . Being a sports star in high school added to your name and got your picture in the paper , but that kind of stuff was always down the line and only if you were really , really good . The most immediate reward was the attention girls might pay to you . And sometimes the reward was sex . A similar message came through the music . There was the bold sexuality of Wilson Pickett 's " Man and a Half . " And the Miracles may have protested that " She 's Not a Bad Girl , " but we knew better . In the movies , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harper and Tony Rome stayed in bed . In the bars , on the street corners , on the bus and at the gates of the factories , we could hear the older men boasting about how they " controlled " their women or of how much they 'd gotten their women to " do " for them  --  clothes , rings , even cars . Now I can see the sad spectacle of the oppressed oppressing someone more oppressed than they , but in those days I was not that sophisticated . In those days , I was being taught that this behavior was " normal . " It was seen as the only way a man could both " protect " and " project " himself . Maturity , leaving the life of " the block " behind , a college education , an awakening need to truly understand and learn from women , the Civil Rights Movement , the consciousness-raising of the sixties and seventies and finally marriage all served to radically transform my attitudes . Like every other father of daughters , I gradually pushed all thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recesses of my memory . How disconcerting to have all those feelings dredged up when my daughters began dating and teenage boys arrived at my door . In a recent episode of the HBO series Sessions , the central character 's anxiety about his daughter on her prom night is illustrated in a fantasy sequence ; The date rings the doorbell and the father answers , to be greeted by a giant penis in a tuxedo , holding a corsage . Every father 's fear come to life . I often talk about my past to my daughters , using what I went through as a signpost for them to follow in understanding boys and learning how to deal with them . My daughters do n't always talk to me about everything ; the most intimate and troubling things they save for their mother . But when they do talk , I try to be as helpful as I can . I like and respect the young men they 've chosen to have in their lives , but the very thought of my daughters being held or kissed or . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though I have learned to accept their sexuality as a fundamental part of their lives . Whom each of my daughters loves , whom she marries , is her business , not mine , as long as the individual is an upstanding citizen and devoted to my daughter the way her mother and I have been . But there is always the fear that the man she chooses will be someone undeserving of this prize I 've nurtured . Fear . For fathers of daughters it is never far from the surface . It is there when she ventures out on that first date or drives the family car or goes away to college . A woman alone . A woman vulnerable . A woman who you and so many men have been taught to believe is an easy victim  --  a mark . So you do everything you can to protect her and sometimes you 're more controlling , more protective than you should be . I once was more angry than I ever should have been at one of my daughters . She had come home late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her safety . I do n't get angry often , perhaps because the depth of the rage I can feel is frightening to me . But I was mad at her that night , and for an instant I saw a look of terror in her eyes as I screamed at her . She was afraid of me  --  of my anger . I never want to see that look again . " Have you lost your mind yelling at that girl like that ? " my wife screamed at me after my daughter had gone to her room . " Nothing she could do deserved that . " I knew she was right , but I also felt that my daughter had put herself at risk  --  taken risks in a world that does not respect women who take risks . Since I 've had daughters , I 've become an avid supporter of women 's rights . I now respect that feminine part of my soul  --  the intuitive , nurturing part of me . The struggle against the violence that threatens all women has become my battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters and all women  --  must fight alone . The moments have and will come when I must let go and accept the fact that they will move through life without my protection . But a father always wonders what he would do if something happened to his daughter . You know you ca n't protect her forever . You tell yourself you ca n't let your concern smother her natural need to grow , to learn , to explore . And you realize that your fear is not only for her . It is for yourself as well . I know there is a rage I 'd feel to the very center of my soul if something should happen to either of my daughters . I know this rage would be all-encompassing , out of control , as destructive to me as to the person who harmed my child . I may never have been aware of the depth of that rage before , but when I contemplate my concern for my daughters , I am confronted with it . And it frightens me in another way : I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I realize that I am vulnerable . I have been faced several times with the fragility of my daughters ' lives and my own impotence in the face of danger . My younger daughter was with me when our car was hit in a traffic accident . Another time a car spun out of control on a stretch of icy road , and there were mere inches between safety and tragedy . Each time her protection was beyond my control . My sense of helplessness was profound . My eldest daughter once fainted in my arms . We were in a local hospital . She was getting a routine blood test , and her fear of needles and the blood test terrified her . When the test was over she stood up , and her eyes rolled up into the back of her head . She gasped for breath , then reeled backward . I caught her , and she went limp in my arms . I felt helpless , frightened . Her welfare at that moment was beyond my control . I was angry at myself in those cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , something I overlooked . Then I began to realize that there is no defense against destiny ; some things simply happen . You can not prepare for them ; you can only be aware that they can happen . And you learn to value every moment with your child as precious and special . When does a father learn to let go ? When does he face the reality that his " little girl " is no longer a child , but a woman , with her own beliefs , value systems and ideas about the world ? Perhaps when she leaves home for her own apartment . Or perhaps on her wedding day , when he finally , symbolically , gives her hand  --  her welfare  --  to a younger , stronger protector . I have a few years before I learn those lessons , but I am trying now to let go , little by little . I am learning to cherish my daughters for the women they are and to see that I have given them the best I have to offer  --  the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to speak for themselves and do n't think twice about doing so . They are tough and smart and can defend themselves . They are not naive about the world , but neither are they as street-smart as they think they are . They do n't always listen , but they learn . Maybe that 's all my wife and I can hope for : that the lessons we 've taught them and the examples we 've set will serve as beacons for these girls of ours as they sail from the haven of childhood into the rocky seas of adulthood . That was my father 's wish for me , and it is certainly my wish for my girls . My daughters . God help me , I love them . I love them so much .
