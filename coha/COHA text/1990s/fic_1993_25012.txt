 | Helping Aunt May die was not the summer job that Jada Sinclair had in mind . In addition to dying , Aunt May had the biggest house in Ravensfield , Idaho , she had Uncle Mac , and she had three hired men for the noon meal six days a week . Other girls had been companions to Aunt May be-fore Jada . But they had not stayed long . The last girl , Izzy Robbins , stayed only three days . She said she worked harder in those three days than she had in her entire life put together and , if she continued , she would be the one having the funeral instead of May Sinclair with the rheumatic heart . Jada did not apply for the position . She did not want to work herself to death any more than Izzy  | heavy lid . And there on the turntable was a thick black record . She ran her fingers lightly over the grooved surface . And read " Remember Me . " Slowly she cranked the handle on the side of the gramophone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lilting tenor voice crooned his song from the spinning disc , wildly fast : Remember me , my own true love , And time will gently fade away , To where our hearts will be as one , In love forever and a day . And then slower and slower as the old spring un-wound : I 'll remember you , You remember , too , Forever we will be Together . Jada was captivated by the haunting old melody . She played it over and over again , singing along with the tenor . Inside one of the trunks , she found an old-fashioned chemise dress , the soft green of spring willows . She lifted it gently , entranced by its shimmering beauty . She slipped it over her head , down over her blouse and  | jeans . Its tapered skirt fell gently to her ankles . In the same trunk she found a white feather boa , which she tossed around her shoulders . She felt di-vine . And if she felt divine , she must certainly look the same . Perhaps even ravishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , Jada danced . She whirled and swayed . She tossed away her shoes and danced on her toes , around the floor and on top of the trunks . She spread her fingers through her curly hair , drawing it out to imaginary lengths . She danced for the ancient balm of Gilead tree out-side , its heart-shaped leaves applauding against the windowpanes . And she called herself Rapunzel of the Beautiful Long Straight Hair . Suddenly she stopped , realizing she had not wound the gramophone for a long time . Yet it played on . She whirled around , breathlessly , expecting some-one  --  Aunt May or Uncle Mac  --  to be standing by the Victrola . Someone was standing there . Someone tall and pleasingly handsome , wearing a brown World War II army uniform . Twirling the handle on the Victrola with one finger , as if there were nothing to it . Standing several inches above the polished oak floor . Smiling at her . It was Starr Freeman . From the photograph on the bureau . Standing by the old Victrola , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he should be there . Jada stood motionless in the willow-green dress with the feather boa falling gently over her arm . Her heart beat wildly beneath the dress . She wanted to flee from the unfamiliar ballroom , throw the dress belonging to someone else back into the trunk , flee quickly from this Departed Spirit , smiling as if she should remember him . Yet she stood motionless . Starr walked toward her , passing through two of Aunt May 's trunks and a leather footstool . He reached out to her , speaking softly . " May I have this dance , Jada Sinclair ? " And Jada said , " Thank you , Starr Freeman . Thank you . "  | " Jada . Jada , honey , " Aunt May called from Jada turned her head in the direction of her aunt 's voice . As she did , she realized she was dancing alone , her arms holding only the white feather boa . She dropped it quickly , fled out of the ballroom and down the stairs . She ran through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedroom . Breathlessly . Aunt May lay against her white starched pillows , breathing hard , her face rosy red . She looked as if she had just raced to the bedroom . And , Jada thought , noticing her aunt 's pink satin house slippers swinging from her toes , perhaps she had !  | " Digitalis ! " She pointed toward the nightstand . " I 'll get it , " Jada said , anxiously . She reached for the pill bottle and a glass of water . Then she fanned her aunt and herself , alternately , with the Redbook magazine . " Do you need anything else ? " she asked . " Anything at all ? " " The electric fan , " Aunt May said faintly , gesturing toward the closet . As Jada carried the fan from the closet , Aunt May sat up straight against her pillows . " Whatever are you doing in my Trousseau Tea dress ? " Jada paused , startled . The green silk rippled in soft waves around her jeans . " Your Trousseau Tea dress ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it toward Aunt May 's rosy red face . " Aunt May " ? she hesitated ? " whatever is a Trousseau Tea dress ? " " You mean to say you have never heard about my Trousseau Tea ? Some people I know are still talking about it . " Aunt May dismissed the offense with a wave of her hand . " When I was young , Jada , a girl looked forward to her Trousseau Tea just as much as to her wedding , I do believe . It was the announcement of the engagement , Jada . " I invited every woman and girl in Caribou County to mine . No one had ever done that before . And no one has done it since , I might add .  | " My father was so worried about rain that he ordered twenty waterproof canopies from San Francisco . He set them up in the front yard and in the back . He kept asking my mother if he should mow the wild timothy , also . " My mother 's answer to any question that summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has invited the entire county . ' " So Father said , ' I will mow the wild timothy pasture just in case . ' " We used it , too , Jada . " " Aunt May , " Jada interrupted , " do you know all the wonderful things you have up in your ballroom ? " " Of course not , " Aunt May answered . " I can not re-member half the things I have stored up there . Every-thing under the sun , I suppose . What were you doing up there making such a racket ? " " I was dancing , Aunt May . There 's an old gramophone up there that still works , with a record of an old song  --  a love song . " Jada whirled around the bedroom , humming the melody . " Before I was dancing , " she added , " I was dusting and sorting . " " I have n't the strength anymore to dust and sort . " Aunt May sighed heavily . " No strength at all . But you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She smiled . " I had almost forgotten my beautiful green dress . It was high style then . A chemise . And  | real silk . I looked wonderful in it . Absolutely stunning , in fact . " Now , take this noisy fan away . " She waved vaguely . " Away to the geraniums . They will enjoy a little cool air . And when you come back , I will tell you all about my Trousseau Tea . " " The geraniums ? " Jada looked at the red geranium plants lining the two windows in the bedroom . Aunt May had red geraniums in every room of the house , including the bathrooms . Jada would have asked the question again , but Aunt May had closed her eyes and lay on her pillows like a sleeping Story Princess . Jada tiptoed out of the room carrying the fan . She set it on the dining-room table , facing the west windows . Then , with a watering can she found on the back porch , she began watering Aunt May 's forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine Aunt May 's Trousseau Tea , announcing her engagement to Uncle Mac . Her mother had told her that beautiful Aunt May had been even more beautiful as a young woman . And that Uncle Mac had once been a highly sought after young bachelor . But forty years ago ? With Uncle Mac stout and balding , and herself in a decline , Aunt May wanted to talk about her engagement ? Forty years ago ? When Jada returned to the bedroom , Aunt May had changed her mind . She had noticed it was suppertime .  | " Perhaps tomorrow , " she said . " But hang my green dress over the closet door so I can look at it and have wonderful dreams . " Uncle Mac prepared supper . He strode noisily in from the garden , his hands and pockets overflowing with vegetables  --  radishes , green onions , peas in the pod , carrots , parsley , and spinach . He admired them  --  each one  --  as he held them up for Jada to see , and then laid them all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut them up and scattered them over two big bowls of bread and milk . One for himself , the other for Jada . On top of each bowl he placed a curly sprig of parsley . " I always plant plenty of parsley , " Uncle Mac ex-claimed . " If it was good enough for old Zeus , it is good enough for me . " He chuckled . " When Aunt May and I returned home from our tour of Greece and Rome a few years ago , Aunt May was all excited about planting an herb garden . For three summers I sowed all those plants of the gods : saffron , rue , and fennel . I ordered them from specialty catalogs . Only the parsley grew . So parsley is good enough for me . " " For me , too , " Jada said . " For you and me and bread and milk . " My twenty-four Greek Beauties . "  | He named them all : Anise , Iris , Laurel , Mustard , Myrtle , Rose , Rosemary , Saffron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feed them parsley , " he said , grinning . " A few handfuls in the haymow , morning and night . " He leaned back in his chair , stretching the buttons of his plaid shirt , and soliloquized : And twice each day I crown their gentle heads , With fragrant wreaths of parsley and alfalfa , Culled green and dew-kissed from the happy earth , As they come lowing , big-uddered , into my cloistered barn . Uncle Mac looked up shyly . " They love it , " he said . " They love you , Uncle Mac , " Jada exclaimed . Uncle Mac laughed uproariously . Until Aunt May 's voice rang out from the bedroom . " What is going on out there ? What has happened to my supper ? " " It 's coming right up , love , " Uncle Mac called . Jada and Uncle Mac prepared a diet tray for Aunt May  --  cold chicken and fresh vegetables  --  with a sprig of curly parsley on top . Uncle Mac carried it in to her , and stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the back porch door and went out to the vegetable garden . As she sliced into the fragrant brown earth , she wondered . Had she  | seen a Departed Spirit today in Aunt May 's ballroom ? Or was she , Jada Sinclair , going crazy ? Had Izzy Rob-bins stayed only three days because she did not like ghosts ? Izzy had left a note on the pillow in the guest room , " To Whom It May Concern , " who turned out to be Jada : Tuck up the ends of the bedspread , or little mice will run up during the night . Izzy Robbins Who Slept Here Jada had pulled off the rose bedspread instantly , along with the blankets and sheets . She shook them all out the bedroom windows . And she did something more than tuck in the trailing corners of the bed-spread . She piled everything in a heap in the middle of the bed and crawled inside . She did not like little mice . But Izzy Robbins had not mentioned a Departed Spirit in her note . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jada went inside . She changed into a bathrobe and then went into the bedroom to talk to Aunt May and Uncle Mac . Aunt May was polishing her fingernails . Uncle Mac was dozing in a blue velvet chair , covered with a blue and white crocheted afghan . His feet were propped up  | on a stack of magazines . " Do you mind if I go upstairs to play the gramophone awhile ? " Jada whispered . " Of course I do n't mind , " Aunt May said . " Turn it up so I can hear it . And maybe it will wake up Uncle Mac . He wo n't talk to me tonight . He talks to his Holsteins , but he wo n't talk to me . He even sings to them , Jada . Imagine , singing to cows . You should hear him . " But first " ? she handed Jada the bottle of polish ? " how do you like it ? " She spread her delicate hands on each side of her face , flashing a bright smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scottsdale , Arizona , last winter . I bought a dozen bottles just for the name . But do n't tell that to Uncle Mac . " She fluttered her fingers in Uncle Mac 's direction . " It reminds me of Rome . The beauty that was Rome  --  or the glory that was Rome . I get it mixed up . Anyway , I love this color . " " Grandeur , " Uncle Mac said , without opening his eyes . " The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome . Edgar Allan Poe . " Jada smiled at Uncle Mac 's balding head as she set the little bottle on a doily on the dresser . Then she turned to look at her aunt 's shining nails . " It 's a splendid color , " she said . Jada climbed the stairs unsteadily , her feet tarrying , her heart racing ahead . The door to the ballroom was open , just as she had 22 left it . She switched on the light , closed the door , and leaned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor where she had dropped it . She picked it up and draped it around her shoulders . " Starr Freeman , " she whispered . " Starr Freeman . " The only sound was the gentle tapping of the tree branches against the dormer windows . And her own rapid breathing . She moved to the gramophone , turned the handle , and started the record , softly , so as not to waken Uncle Mac . The tenor voice sang plaintively : I 'll remember you , You remember , too .. . The song faded . But still Jada waited . Expecting , hoping , waiting . Her eyes became heavy , her body weary . Waiting for what ? Waiting for whom ? She shook herself from the cloudiness . With a resolute sigh , she closed the heavy lid of the gramophone , slipped the feather boa from her shoulders , then went downstairs to her bedroom . She walked over to the bureau and looked directly into Starr Freeman 's photograph . His army visor cap was placed squarely on his head , low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was visible only above his ears . His smile was eager , his blue eyes haunting.  | " I went back , " Jada whispered . " I waited . " She reached out , hesitantly , and touched the silver frame , then turned away . Crawling into her bedding , she decided that like Izzy Robbins , she was working too hard . She had not really danced with a Departed Spirit upstairs in the ballroom , after all .  | Uncle Mac was a loud man , who stomped and snorted early in the morning , a habit acquired from spending so much time in the company of clamorous animals and power machinery . Also his red plaid shirts made him look loud . Jada wakened to his noisy stomping as he came into the kitchen , bringing the morning milk . He had been up since dawn , milking his twenty-four Holstein cows . She jumped from her bed and hurried out to the kitchen in her bathrobe . " You start working too early , " she chided . " The sun is just coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . Turning on electric milking machines . Pitching a little  | hay and parsley into the haymow for my Greek Beau-ties . I do n't call that work , Jada . " He swung the milk into the refrigerator , and then washed up on the back porch . He stomped back into the kitchen , rubbing his neck with a towel . " Now living in a condo in Arizona all winter , " he continued , " dressing up and driving in traffic to eat your supper , trying to carry on a conversation with folks who do n't know what a bushel of grain is worth , and do n't care  --  now that is what I call work . " He paused . " Although Aunt May calls it entertainment . " Jada smiled . " The teakettle is boiling , Uncle Mac . Come and fix your Postum . " Uncle Mac raised wheat . Uncle Mac sold wheat . And that was the reason Uncle Mac drank Postum every morning for breakfast . " Let the hardworking farmers in Florida drink orange juice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho drink hot wheat Postum . By the way , Jada , are you working too hard ? " " Not yet , Uncle Mac , " Jada answered . " I just got up . As soon as Uncle Mac went out to work , Jada hurried into Aunt May 's bedroom with half a grapefruit on a tray . " I 'm so lonely , Jada , honey , " she said . " Do you think you could go buy me a magazine today ? A McCall 's or Redbook ? "  | " Of course , " Jada answered cheerfully . She took a thermometer from its plastic case on the nightstand , shook it down , and stuck it under Aunt May 's tongue . " Right after dinner . I have just started a batch of bread , as you asked last night , and I ca n't leave it . " What she felt like saying was " If you would get up and mix your own bread , May Sinclair , you would not feel so lonely . " But she was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timer on the nightstand , she removed the thermometer , squinting to read it ac-curately . " You are normal again , Aunt May . " She smiled to herself , suspecting that the temperature reading would seldom vary . Aunt May wrinkled her delicate Story Princess nose . " But I 'm so lonely . " Back in the kitchen Jada stood at the table mixing bread , her hands deep in foaming yeast and flour . She glanced up from her work as a figure darkened the screen door of the porch . Daniel Bates stood outside , silhouetted against the morning sun . Jada sighed . " What are you doing here , Daniel ? " She kept her voice low , so as not to disturb Aunt May . " I heard you were in the clinic having your tonsils out today . " " I walked out . " " Twelve miles ? "  | He nodded . " I caught a ride with the milkman most of the way . Can you open the screen ? " " I ca n't . " Jada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm mixing bread . " Daniel opened the screen door and walked in , through the porch and into the kitchen . He stood across the table from Jada , his husky form blocking the sunlight from the porch door . Printed across his chest on a faded red T-shirt were the letters " F.F.A. " And below , " Future Farmers of America . " Jada scolded . " You should not be here , Daniel . " " I know . " He grinned . " Then why are you ? " " Does this prove what I said ? You know . About you and me ? " His eyes pled hopefully . Jada rolled the ball of dough over and slapped its plumpness . It made a gratifying sound . She rubbed flour from her arms . " It does n't prove a thing , Daniel , " she said . He moved to a chair and sat down , breathing heavily . " They are still bleeding . " " I 'll call your mother . Just as soon as I get this dough off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , Jade . " Aunt May 's voice rang through the house . " Who are you talking to , Jada ? " " Good grief , Daniel . " Jada slapped the dough again . " Do you want to give my aunt May a heart attack ? Why did you come here , anyway ? "  | " I told you I 'd prove it . " " Eating raw eggs , sleeping on the grain elevator . And now this . It does not prove a thing . " Jada scowled . Daniel wiped his perspiring forehead with his arm , then rubbed it across his T-shirt . " Get yourself a glass of water , Daniel . And sip it . Then go home , or I will call your mother . " He got himself a drink and sipped it slowly , wincing with each swallow . " Who is out there with you ? " Aunt May called again . Jada frowned at Daniel . She walked into the dining room with dough still clinging to her hands . " It 's Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water . Just on his way home . " Back in the kitchen she said , " I had my tonsils out before the first grade . I stayed in the hospital two days . " " I just had mine out this morning , " Daniel said , sinking into a chair . " The doctor thinks I am still in the clinic . My mother thinks I am still in the clinic . You are the only one who knows I 'm not . " " Except the milkman . " " He does n't know . I did n't tell him anything . " Aunt May was calling again . " Jada , honey , how can you mix bread and socialize , too ? You 'll forget the salt . " " Go home , Daniel . " Jada pounded the ball of  | dough . " And do n't ever prove anything to me again . Anything ! " Daniel stood and moved slowly out of the kitchen and through the porch . He opened the screen door , turned , and looked woefully through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I do n't want a girl who was left on a church bench , anyway . " " Just overnight , " Jada retorted . " And by my own parents . " He shrugged his shoulders , then made his way down the front path lined with nasturtiums and out the gate . The gate slammed shut behind him . Jada felt as lonely as Aunt May without a magazine . Whenever Daniel talked of the church bench incident , she felt this way . He had revealed the event , unexpectedly , five years ago when they were both eleven . After a Sunday-school lesson on Moses in the bulrushes , he had announced to the class , " Let 's all go to the cloakroom and see where Jada Sinclair was abandoned . " " Show us , show us , " the others cried , pulling Jada along with them . " My mother said it was in the main hall , " one girl exclaimed . " Mine said it was in the cloakroom , " another said . " I 'll show you where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Let Daniel show you , " Jada had said , laughing be-cause it hurt so much .  | She felt betrayed , not because she had been left overnight in the church as a baby , but because she had not known about it until that moment , and everyone else in Ravensfield knew . They had been laughing at her all her life . " With you , " her mother said later . " At me , " Jada insisted . " Because I never knew . Why did n't you tell me ? " " It was not important , " her mother said . " I had for-gotten all about it . Now you forget about it . " " Tell that to Daniel Bates , " Jada said . At noon , Jada served " a royal banquet , " according to Uncle Mac : fried chicken , fresh peas , and fresh spinach salad . All from the garden , except the fried chicken , which came from Uncle Mac 's chicken coop via the freezer . Hot scones with honey butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take back to the hay field . Uncle Mac said that after such feasting he and his hired men would never make it back to their tractors . They waddled as far as the back porch , loosened their belts , and stretched out on the rag rugs . And napped . Uncle Mac was good to his hired men , and every-one in Ravensfield knew it . No sack lunches in the shade of the tractor for them . They ate dinner in the dining room and napped on the rag rugs after , just the same as he did . Of course , they were Ravensfield men who lived  | nearby . Each evening after work they jumped into their pickup trucks and drove home for their own bread and milk . But Uncle Mac would have treated a stranger just the same . Jada prepared a dinner tray for Aunt May , arranging the vegetables in a rainbow across a blue china plate . She covered it with a linen napkin and carried it into the bedroom . Aunt May lifted the napkin and frowned at the vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the electric fan and told Aunt May that she could go for a magazine just as soon as the bread was out of the oven . " I 'm so lonely , " Aunt May said . " Buy both magazines , will you , Jada ? " At last , the six loaves of baked bread lay cooling on the cupboard . Jada took a straw hat from a shelf on the back porch , tiptoed around the napping men , and slipped out the door .  | Ravensfield was roasting like a plump marshmallow under the June sun as Jada walked up the dusty road to the general store , cemented firmly to a pointed sagebrush hill , standing upright and alone in red brick . From the road Jada could see the three pointed hills that made up Ravensfield proper  --  the general store on one , the church on another , and the cemetery hill . Wherever she was , at any time , she could see those hills in her mind 's eye . Once considered by the Union Pacific Railroad for a water station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Blocks were laid out , and grass was planted in the cemetery . But then someone in an Eastern railroad office had  | changed his mind , and Billington became the water stop  --  and a proper town . And so , abandoned as it was , Ravensfield had never looked like any kind of place . Just a spot roasting in the sun , waiting for its Turkey Red Wheat and its " Red Baldie " cattle to grow rich in protein . Uncle Mac liked it just the way it was . But Aunt May  --  Jada wondered about Aunt May . At the top of the hill , Jada walked along a dirt path through the sagebrush . She climbed the worn wooden steps to the store and opened the screen door . " How are you , Jada Sinclair ? " Mrs. Dunford stood in front of a large electric fan , mounted on top of the refrigeration units , wearing her sister-in-law 's old fur coat . The sister from Pocatello had given her old mink coat to Mr. Dunford to wear on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who wore it , win-ter and summer . " I am fine , thank you . How are you , Mrs. Dun-ford ? " Jada walked over to the magazine rack . " And how 's your aunt May this red-hot day ? " The rotating fan moved the fur across Mrs. Dunford 's body in dark undulating waves . Like an animated bear . " She 's as fine as can be expected , " Jada said . " But lonely . That 's the reason I am buying these magazines . " " Poor Mac . " Old Mrs. Reid pushed her shopping cart past the magazine rack , shaking her silver head at Jada.  | " It is not Uncle Mac who is sick , " Jada explained to Mrs. Reid , and anyone else who might be listening . " I know , " Mrs. Reid said , still shaking her head . " Poor Mac . " " Tall for a Sinclair , are n't you ? " Mrs. Dunford said , making change for the magazines . Her forehead was shining with perspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly hair come from ? " Mrs. Reid called over to Mrs. Dunford . " Wish my Pauline had it . " " Wish I could give it to her , " Jada said , not knowing what else to say . She tucked the magazine sack under her arm and hurried out the door . She took a shortcut through the sagebrush over to the church and sat on the shaded front steps . She flipped through the magazines , wondering how any-one as beautiful and rich as Aunt May could be lonely . It was Jada who knew about lonely . People were laughing at her . Laughing because she was too tall for a Sinclair . Laughing at her curly hair . And the more she thought about it , the more she suspected she was n't a Sinclair at all . She was probably a changeling . " How could you have forgotten me ? " Jada had asked her mother . " Your own baby ? " " We were having such a good time at the dance , " her mother said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were our first . " " But when you arrived home and saw the empty crib , why did n't you rush back for me ? "  | " We tried . We became so excited that your father flooded the Buick . And then it would not start at all . And it was snowing  --  a terrible snowstorm for March . So we decided you would sleep there in the arms of God just as soundly as in your own crib . We drove back to the church first thing the next morning . " " Was I awake ? " " I can not remember that , " her mother said . " That means I was awake . " Jada moaned . " Was I crying ? " " That you were not . " " But I was frightened , was n't I ? Talking to myself , vowing never to trust anyone again . " " You were doing nothing of the kind . " Jada looked her mother directly in the eye . " And I have never been normal since . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always considered it a special blessing . " That was the betrayal . They had completely forgot-ten it , yet they had always considered it a special blessing . Now that was something to worry about , and Jada had been worrying about it for five years . She pushed the magazines back into the sack , then left the church steps , walking aimlessly . A few minutes later she stopped at the bottom of the cemetery hill , where an old log cabin stood , sheltered by a tall hedge of scraggly lilac bushes , as long untended as the cabin , riotous with fragrant lavender blossoms .  | Jada dropped the sack on a nearby rock and ran to the balmy hedge , gathering blossoms until her arms could hold no more . Then , wondering what she would do with such a harvest , she turned to the small cemetery on top of the hill . Encumbered by the flowers , she walked slowly up the narrow road . In the field to the east she could see Mr. Bates on his John Deere tractor , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallowing . Getting his field ready to plant Turkey Red Wheat in the fall . Long brown birds ran through the sagebrush beside the wire fence , trying to distract him from their nests . Crying , " Killdeer , killdeer . " But Mr. Bates could not hear the fearless little birds over the noise of the tractor engine and his son 's portable radio , swinging from the back of the tractor seat . At the top of the hill Jada crawled over the wooden gate , still holding the lilacs in her arms . Near the gate on the north were the oldest graves on the hill , Oregon Trail graves with wooden markers , faded and splintered . The names , once lovingly carved , were erased by time and weather . Lost for-ever . Jada scattered lilac blossoms over the graves as she walked past . For remembrance and a little color . And to relieve her weary arms . The next section looked like a museum of art with  | marble statuary . Winged angels , busts of little children , curly-haired lambs reclining on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but beautiful still . Jada leaned down to read the water-stained inscriptions : " An Angel has returned Home . " " Our little Darling is At Rest . " She discovered short verses , which she whispered over and over again . A poem for Mary , August 1898 ? September 1898 : A LITTLE TIME ON EARTH SHE SPENT , NTH . GOD FOR HER HIs ANGELS SENT . And for Benjamin , May 1890 ? May 1896 : A LIGHT FROM OUR HOUSEHOLD IS GONE , A VOICE WE LOVED IS STILLED ; THERE 'S A VACANT SPOT UPON OUR HEARTH THAT NEVER CAN BE FILLED . Jada left lilacs for Mary and Benjamin , then moved on to a newer section . The headstones here were small flat granite markers , simply inscribed : " Rest in Peace . " " Absent , but not forgotten . " Brief , these twentieth-century mourners , she thought as she wandered . For Great-Aunt Willa Sinclair , the beautiful bride who died in the flu epidemic of 1918 , was the unadorned  | phrase " ' Til We Meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beautiful Aunt Willa , wed in September , dead in December . That winter the snow had been too deep for a team of horses to pull a sleigh up to the cemetery . Beautiful Aunt Willa stayed in her casket on the bishop 's back porch until spring . And Great-Uncle Warren was consumed with sorrow . Willa and Warren . Even their names embraced . Jada placed a lilac blossom below the small head-stone . " You wo n't have to wait much longer , Aunt Willa , " she whispered . " Uncle Warren is old as old now , in a rest home in Pocatello . " Of course , there is an Aunt Grace there , too , just as old . Standing at the front door of the rest home with her suitcase . Saying she wants to go first so Uncle Warren wo n't be alone with his precious Willa . " Jada sighed . " I do n't know how this is going to end , Aunt Willa . But you wo n't have to wait much longer to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resting in Peace . None of this for her , she vowed . As soon as she had enough money , which would not be long now , she would take care of her own headstone . And it definitely would not read " Rest in Peace . " If she looked carefully  --  Jada 's heart fluttered  --  perhaps she could find .. . She turned toward the newest section of the cemetery , to the east , next to Mr. Bates 's wheat field . On a  | small knoll near the fence stood a weeping willow tree . Its branches reached gently into the sky , then arched earthward , as if to shelter those who rested beneath . With the lilacs still in her arms , Jada ran toward the tree . Perhaps , perhaps . . . She pressed through the swaying wands and the filigree leaves . Starr Freeman was there . Reclining on his grave in his summer fatigues , chewing a stem of June grass . " Is  --  is it you ? " Jada asked , trembling with fright . Trembling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's my grave . " Starr laughed softly and sat up . " And now may I ask you the same question ? What are you doing here , Jada Sinclair ? " " I  --  I brought you these lilacs , " Jada stammered , " and ? " " Thank you . I love stolen flowers . And ? " " And I was just going to check something . " " A date on my headstone ? " Starr asked . " But you already know that date . February 10 , 1944 . " Bewildered , she said , " It was my birth date , and I have always felt . . . " The words would not come . She looked away , then down at the lilacs in her arms . " Yes , Jada . What have you always felt ? " Starr looked at her expectantly . She swallowed hard . She could not explain what she felt . She just always stopped in front of the American Legion monument whenever she passed the City Hall . She had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen years old . That he was killed on the day she was born . February 10 , 1944 . And Carleen said , " So what ? My cat had kittens one year on my birthday . " Jada had not mentioned it again . She clutched at the lilacs in her arms . And looked into Starr 's steady gaze . " When you see your birth date in bronze in front of the City Hall , " she said , " you notice it . " He smiled . Then he stood up and stretched his long arms . " Mr. Bates is plowing a crooked furrow , looking this way . I 'll be going now . " Jada reached out . " Are you always here ? " she asked . He sighed and put his hands in his pockets . " I travel . " They stood in silence , looking at each other . Starr reached over and took a lilac blossom from Jada 's arms . He held it a few moments , then tucked it in her curly hair . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you want ? " Jada whispered , scarcely breathing . He simply smiled at her , but his smile held her spellbound . And then , suddenly , he was gone . " Stay ? " Jada 's throat tightened as she cried out . She whirled around , mystified , and the lilacs tumbled from her arms in a lavender cascade . She dropped to her knees , crushing the fragrant blossoms against the warm earth .  | For a long time she knelt at his grave , forgetting time and place . She was aware only of a great loneliness and the fragile scent of the lilacs . And then later , Mr. Bates , pulling his plow up his long field . She could hear his radio playing " Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain , " and closer , the plaintive wail of the brown birds running in the sagebrush . " Killdeer , killdeer. "  | crazy girMy dad says why do I want to marry a crazy girl ? " Daniel Bates appeared between two rows of wet pillowcases hanging on Aunt May 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with tools , and a pair of pliers swung from a loop on one leg . " Do n't touch Aunt May 's pillowcases , " Jada warned , " if you have any tractor grease on you . " She snapped a clothespin over the end of a pillowcase . " I do n't want to wash and starch them all over again . " Daniel braced his hands on his striped hips , his el-bows grazing the pillowcases . " So what were you doing in the cemetery yesterday ? " " Visiting . "  | " There was n't anybody in that cemetery to visit with , Jade . What am I going to tell my dad ? You going crazy ? " " Tell him anything . It does n't matter . " Jada moved down the clothesline , snapping on pillowcases . Changing pillowcases twice each day for Aunt May made twenty-eight pillowcases a week . Uncle Mac said not to worry about changing his , but Aunt May did not like the sets to get mixed up . A plain white next to embroidered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and well alike . " Red , white , or water lilies , " Uncle Mac said , " I sleep just the same . " " What do you mean , it does n't matter ? " Daniel followed Jada down the row , grazing the pillowcases . " I 've been courting you since first grade . " " And you are wasting your time . Do n't you know that ? " Jada moved to another line . " Now , if you do n't want to see Aunt May 's nighties and things , you had better go home . " " You are ungrateful , Jade . Ungrateful and crazy . " Daniel ducked under the pillowcases . After a few minutes Jada said , " If you are staying , hand me the clothespins . " She nodded toward the laundry basket . " Two at a time . " Daniel reached for the clothespins . " Why are you hanging out the washing this late in the day  --  after supper ? Washing should be hung out in the morning and dry before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I do n't know that , Daniel . I started early . " " Why does n't Aunt May get an automatic washer and dryer like my mother has ? " Daniel 's lips curled into a sneer . " You go into the bedroom and ask her , Daniel . All I know is , this is the way she wants her washing done , and this is the way I am getting paid to do it . " " Maybe if you would n't hang out in the cemetery , you could hang out your washing on time . " He laughed and slapped his hip just above the pliers . " Maybe . " At last , the washing was all on the lines , and Jada breathed a gratified sigh . She hurried over to the gar-den where she had left two buckets , one filled with peas , the other empty , and carried them to the house . Daniel followed . " Since you are staying , Daniel , " she said , sitting on the porch step , " help with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Daniel sat down next to Jada . He picked up a handful of pea pods , reluctantly . " I did not come here to shell peas , " he said , looking up . " Then you might as well go home , " Jada said , " be-cause these peas need to be shelled . " She worked quickly , popping the peas out of their crisp pods , dropping them into the bucket . After several minutes of silence , she looked across at Daniel . He was eating peas as he shelled them .  | " How are your tonsils ? " " That 's a crazy question . " " I do n't see why , " Jada said . " Only last week you were here , peering through the screen door , white as that nightie of Aunt May 's , talking nonsense . All be-cause of your tonsils . " " They 're out . That 's how they are . " Daniel nudged Jada with his elbow . " You can call the clinic if you want to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you took out of Daniel Bates last week ? ' " " Forget it . " " And the nurse will say , ' His tonsils are fine , pick-led here in a jar . But Daniel Bates himself disappeared ? ' " " Sorry I asked about your tonsils , Daniel . Maybe you should go home . You are eating as fast as you are shelling . " Daniel tossed a handful of empty pods to the ground and brushed his hands together . " I have n't done what I came for . " " Oh ? " " You know the Fourth of July Basket Dance at the church ? " " I know it . I am not going . " " Everybody goes . " " Well , I 'm not this year . " " Everybody always goes , " Daniel said . " And what I came here for is to ask if you would go to the dance with me. "  | " No , I will not go to the dance with you . " " Why not ? " Jada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just said because I am not going . " Daniel stood up and kicked against the step . " Everybody goes , Jade . What color ribbon are you putting on your basket ? " " I am not putting ribbon of any color on my basket . I 'm not making a basket . " " It can be a covered shoe box . Nearly everybody covers a shoe box and calls it a basket . You did last year . " Daniel kicked the step again . The pliers swung on his leg . " Go home , Daniel . " " Are you going to embarrass me this year like you did last year ? Are you going to fill a shoe box with peas again ? And write a crazy poem on top ? How did it go ? " He squinted his eyes and recited : " Food for your body , Food for your soul ; First shell the peas , And then rock and roll ! " " That 's it , " Jada said . " Word perfect . " Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept to herself  --  real poetry about loneliness and love . She wrote her final drafts on blue-flowered sta-  | tionery and put them in a box under her bed , where no one would read them . " Are you going to do that again ? " Daniel was insis-tent . Jada stammered . " I  --  I just said I was n't . " " Well , why did your mother let you pull a trick like that ? A box full of old garden peas when everybody else was eating fried chicken and potato salad ? " " New garden peas , " Jada said . " And you can not say it was a trick when the bishop read right out loud what was inside . You kept bidding anyway , as if you were just aching to shell those peas . " " Four dollars and seventy-five cents to shell peas ? My dad said you should have paid me four seventy-five to sit there and shell peas while everybody else was eating fried chicken and potato salad . Eating their heads off , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the porch step , glowering . " You wo n't have to worry this year , " Jada said , " be-cause I am not going . I 'm helping Aunt May die , full-time . " " Everybody always goes . Just do n't bring another shoe box filled with peas . " Jada stood , picked up the buckets , and opened the screen door with one finger . It slammed shut behind her . " What 's happening out there ? " Aunt May called . " Nothing , " Jada called back . " I have been outside  | hanging the washing and shelling peas on the porch step . Sorry about the screen door . I had my hands full . " " I thought I heard voices . " " Oh , yes . Daniel Bates was here . Borrowing the hoe for his mother . " " Well , tell him to return it soon . Not like last time . Two weeks without your own hoe is too long . " " Return the hoe soon , " Jada called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen door . " Not two weeks like last time . " " I 'm not borrowing your hoe , " he snapped . Jada shrugged her shoulders . " I came here out of plain love , " he said . " Just plain love . " Plain love , romantic love . What did it all mean ? Perhaps If she wrote a poem about it  --  and put it in her box- , she might understand plain love , romantic love . She turned away , bewildered . " Good-by , Daniel Bates , " she said . " Just what I do not need is plain love . "  | On weekends Jada went home . Her mother drove across the valley for her , with Jada 's brother and sister , Tim and Mandy . They asked questions . " How much money have you made ? " " Aunt May still dying ? " At home , her mother did not ask her to do a thing , not at all consistent with her Depression philosophy . She told her to rest , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Jada sat on the steps of her own front porch , looking at her own trees . Resting and wondering . Wondering about the purpose of it all . Living , loving , and then dying . One Sunday afternoon she asked her mother , " Do  | you remember Starr Freeman ? " " Yes , of course . Why do you ask , Jada ? " Her mother sat down on the porch step beside her . " Aunt May still has his picture in a double frame with Rosanne 's . I would think that after sixteen years she would put it away . When Rosanne comes to visit , what does she think ? And her husband ? " " I do n't know , " her mother said , smoothing her dress with her hands , " and after all these years . But Aunt May and Uncle Mac adored him . Almost like a son . It was such a tragedy . " " Tell me what happened , " Jada said . Her mother looked off into the distance , over the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was killed in the war in 1944 . Somewhere over there in the Pacific . He was a gunner on a B ? 17 bomber . His plane was shot down by Japanese fighters over a little island near New Guinea , I believe . That 's about all we were told . " Jada chilled suddenly , and she hugged her knees to steady herself . " February 10 , 1944 , " she said softly . " He died on the day I was born . Do you think that is strange , Mother ? For any reason ? " Her mother shook her head . " No , Jada . It is just a coincidence . Consider it a special blessing . " After a few minutes Jada said , " Speaking of special blessings , what about my curly hair ? " " What about it ? "  | " Where did it come from ? You do n't have curly hair . Nor does Dad . " Her mother smiled . " Oh , that comes from your grandfather Attwood on my side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I remember as a little girl watching him standing in front of the mirror on a Sunday morning , cursing those curls ? " " Gypsies have curly hair , " Jada interrupted . " Gypsies who wander in the night and exchange babies . " " Do n't be ridiculous , " her mother said . Early Monday morning Jada 's mother drove her back to Aunt May 's . As Jada stepped out of the car , she felt a quick beat of her heart , and she knew that she had missed this big brick house , its wide lawns and gardens . She had missed Uncle Mac and  --  she smiled wryly  --  Aunt May . In the distance she heard contented cackling from the chicken coop , the hum of the milking machines in the barn , and over it all Uncle Mac singing to his Greek Beauties , " 0 Solo Mio ... " She waved good-by to her mother and hurried up the path to the house , snatching up a few nasturtiums on her way . Aunt May was fretting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was in disarray , and trays of dirty dishes were stacked on the bureau . " You are here at last , Jada , honey , " she said , waving  | her arms dramatically , " to bring order out of chaos . " " Did Miss Millie not come on Saturday ? " Jada asked , surprised . " Oh , Miss Millie came on Saturday , all right , " Aunt May said . " But " ? she wrinkled her Story Princess nose ? " the dry farmers came on Sunday . " Dry farmers , " she continued , " are bound and determined to visit the sick and afflicted on Sundays , whether the sick and afflicted feel up to seeing them or not . And in return they expect a dish of ice cream and a slide show of Greece and Rome . " And dry farmers just want to see the nude statues . Not the castles or the cathedrals . Just the nude statues . And Jada , all the statues are nude . You ca n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as art . " It looked to Jada as if the dry farmers had eaten more than ice cream during the slide show , but since she was not paid to criticize , she began cleaning up . All morning she cleaned the house and watered the vegetable garden , running back and forth until it was time to prepare dinner . In the afternoon she ironed a basket of starched pillowcases out on the back porch where it was cool . Then she watered the forty red geraniums on the windowsills , saving that pleasant chore until last . And by evening there was , as Aunt May said , order out of chaos . In the cool of the evening , Jada went outside to the garden . " What 's going on here in the Garden of Eatin ' ? "  | Daniel Bates shuffled down the long rows of vegeta-bles . " I am working , " Jada exclaimed . " And if you are going to come around every night to talk , Daniel , you will have to pick peas while you are doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step over them . Here 's a bucket . Start up there at the end of this row . " Daniel took the bucket , turned it over , and sat down . He picked the peas from the top of the vines , noisily snapping open the pods . He tossed the tiny peas into the air and caught them in his mouth . " Is that all you think about  --  eating ? " Jada stepped around him and continued her work . " What else do you want me to think about ? " He tossed a few more peas , then stopped suddenly . His face flooded pink . " Hey . " He stood up . " I 'm thinking about it right now . Do you want to wander over to that old willow tree in the front yard ? Meet me there in two and a half minutes ? " He raised his eyebrows a couple of times . " Whatever for ? " Jada called . She moved low over the dense vines . " You know what for , Jade . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jada said . " My soul . You want to see my soul ? " She set down her bucket and stood up straight to rest her back . She began deep-breathing exercises . " Your what ? " " My soul , " Jada said breathlessly .  | " We were not talking about any soul . " Daniel groaned and held his head . " Hey " ? he looked sidelong at Jada ? " are you writing another poem on me ? " " No , I 'm exercising , " Jada said . " And Daniel , you can not do what you have in mind under a balm of Gilead tree . That 's a sacred tree , you know . If you blaspheme under its leaves , they will drop off that very minute , and everyone in the valley will know what you did . " Daniel pulled at a cluster of peas , bringing vines and roots up at the same time . He looked at the green mass in surprise . " Why did n't they plant the gosh-darn tree on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tree getting upset just because a guy wants to kiss his girl ? " Jada handed him the bucket again . " Here . Start working . " Daniel threw in a few peas , until the bottom of the bucket was covered . When Jada 's bucket was filled , she moved over to the rhubarb patch to pull a few stalks for breakfast . Uncle Mac loved boiled rhubarb , with lots of sugar to make it sweet . Daniel followed . " Why did your folks name you Jade ? " he asked . " They did n't . They named me Jada . J-a-d-a . " " It sounds like a mare 's name . Gitty-up , Jade .  | Whoa-back , Jade . How can you stand having a horse 's name ? " Jada pulled at the rhubarb . " If you do n't like it , Daniel , why do n't you go talk to someone with a pretty name ? Like Patsy Wilson . She lives almost in your backyard and with a pretty name , too . " " Patsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit she has a pretty name . " " Yes , but she is skin and bones . She squeaks when she walks . " " If a pretty name is so important , though , maybe you could get used to skin and bones . It 's worth thinking about . " " Yes , but ? " " I know . Here , cut the tops off this rhubarb . " Jada fanned herself with a large leaf . She stopped suddenly . " Now , that is a name for you , " she said . " Rhubarbara . I think I would like to be named Rhubarbara . That identifies my body and speaks to my soul , too . " She pushed a stalk of rhubarb down the back of her blouse , the large ruffly leaf framing her slender face . She turned to Daniel . " Why do n't you start calling me Rhubarbara , since you do n't like Jada ? " " It sounds worse than a horse 's name . " " You ca n't have everything in this life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalks of rhubarb and the  | bucket of peas and walked toward the house . " Think about it on your way home , Daniel , " she called . " Skin and bones , or a horse 's name . You ca n't have everything . " She left the bucket of peas on the back porch and carried the rhubarb in to show Aunt May how her garden was growing . Aunt May was filing her nails , and Uncle Mac was dozing in his chair . " Whatever is that rhubarb doing down the back of your neck ? " Aunt May exclaimed . She held the fingernail file in midair . " Your garden is growing everywhere , Aunt May . " Jada laughed . " And that is n't all , " she added . " This morning when I was dusting , I found a five-pound brick of cheese in the radio-phonograph console in the living room , and ? " " Oh , just leave it there , " Aunt May whispered , nodding toward Uncle Mac . " It must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it to him . " " And the chocolates behind the World Books ? " " Oh , the dear . " Aunt May laughed softly . " Do n't mention those , either . " She winked secretively . " Now take all that living produce out of my bedroom . " She flourished the fingernail file in Jada 's direction . Jada wanted to ask Aunt May about something else . About someone else . But she did not want to up-set her aunt . Walking back out to the kitchen , she paused at the  | bottom of the stairway , wondering . Then , impulsively , she pulled the rhubarb from her blouse and tossed it onto a chair . And she ran up the stairs . Jada opened the door to the ballroom and looked around , expectantly . " Starr Freeman , " she whispered . She closed the door and leaned against it , wondering why she expected him to come again . She looked across the room to the dormer windows , where bright blue sky flickered through clusters of heart-shaped leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handle . From the old record the tenor sang his haunting melody . " Jada . Jada Sinclair . " She turned quickly . Starr was standing in front of the windows , smiling , the balsam scent of the heart-shaped leaves encircling him . Jada drew back , trembling . Yet , fearful that he would disappear as suddenly as he had come , she spoke quickly . " I know who you are , Starr Freeman . But how do you know me ? " " I know who you are , Jada Sinclair . " " What do you want , Starr Freeman ? Do you want to talk about the war ? " " If you would like to , yes , Jada Sinclair , " Starr an-swered.  | " I  --  I do n't know about the war , " Jada stammered . " We did not get that far in U.S. History last year be-cause it was the last chapter of the book . I apologize for Miss Lundeen and the junior class . But since World War II was before my time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Starr sat down on a trunk and crossed one leg over the other . He looked eagerly at Jada . " They are not the kind of stories you would expect , " she said , faltering . She sat down opposite Starr in a faded wing chair , studying his face . " Good . " " And I only know one . " Suddenly she felt foolish . She turned her head from Starr 's intense gaze and looked down at her hands in her lap . " On second thought , " she whispered , " I do n't think I will . " " Perhaps I have interfered . . . " He stood , his smile fading . " Oh , please do n't go , " Jada cried , reaching out . " I would like to talk about the war . I would like to tell the story . " She began quickly . " Once upon a time during World War II  --  do you remember my grandmother Sinclair ? " " Of course . Delightful woman , " Starr said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers ? " " She was knitting when I left . "  | " Well , " Jada continued , " all the women in the valley knitted stockings for the soldiers . One day Grand-mother Sinclair challenged Mrs. Dunford to put a love note in one of the stockings . Mrs. Dunford would not , because of sacrilege she said . So Grandmother did . She wrote : Call me after the war , Soldier Boy . I 'll be waiting for you , breathlessly . Portia Sinclair U.S.A. " Can you guess who received her note ? " Jada asked . " Not in a million years . " " Edward McGee , her neighbor . Out of hundreds and hundreds of American soldiers ? " " Twelve million , to be exact , " Starr interjected . " Out of twelve million American soldiers in World War II , " Jada repeated , " and out of who knows how many million pairs of hand-knitted stockings , her own neighbor boy received that one pair . He sent her an airmail letter : Do n't hold your breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will return to Ravensfield . And you . Your Soldier Boy and Your Neighbor Boy , Edward McGee Southern France  | " My old buddy , Ed McGee ? " Starr smiled pleasantly . " Edward McGee . He told it at her funeral last year , even though everyone knew it already . I have never heard people laugh at a funeral before . But everyone was laughing with her , as she lay there in her beautiful casket . " Starr chuckled , and then he laughed uproariously . " It 's a good story , " he said . " Write it down , Jada . Put it in your box . " Jada looked up , startled . How did he know ? Starr did not give her time to ask . He was across the room , whirling the handle of the old gramophone . " Would you like to dance ? " he asked . " I imagine you can mend that entire stack of broken records , " Jada said , indicating the box on the floor , " with one wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I ca n't . But I do believe this is our song . " He reached for Jada 's hand . The familiar tune drifted forth from the gramophone : I 'll remember you , You remember , too .. . They danced as the sky darkened outside and the moon rose over the mountains , flooding the ballroom with a soft silver light . " Will you , Jada of the exquisite name , " Starr asked ,  | as the music faded , " meet me tomorrow night under the old balm of Gilead tree ? So I will not have to fly around like a bat ? " After he left , Jada realized that she still did not know why Starr Freeman had come to her . But he had told her to write a story . And he had called her name exquisite . Jada of the exquisite name .  | At the end of June , Ravensfield Valley was shimmering green under the midsummer sun . In the mountains the tall pines and quaking aspens sheltered the Red Baldies as they grazed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tails at an occasional bee . Grazing and growing . Down in the valley the wheat stood tall and green . Impatient . Desiring to turn golden . Acres and acres of green wheat . Still growing . Scattered between the wheat fields , the emerald green alfalfa was opening into purple blossom . Awaiting the mower before it lost its bloom and its rich protein . Although forever marked with patches of sun-struck sagebrush and dark outcroppings of volcanic  | rock , Ravensfield Valley in June was as green and glorious as it would ever be . Uncle Mac was knee-deep in his first crop of hay . Right on schedule . He planned to have the entire first crop mowed and stacked by the Fourth of July . He al-ways did unless it rained . And it seldom rained with-out Uncle Mac 's permission . " It 's a bountiful first crop , Jada , " Uncle Mac declared over his Postum . " Unless it rains while the hay is down  --  which it wo n't . But there is a heavy dew this summer , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through your fields every morning , Uncle Mac , checking the dew ? " Jada asked . " That 's right , " Uncle Mac said . " If hay is stacked too wet , it spoils . If it is stacked too dry , it breaks into pieces . All the leaves fall off and only the stalks are left . " He stirred his Postum slowly , then tapped the spoon on the cup . " My Greek Beauties wo n't touch poor hay . I have to sell it then . " " To someone who has ordinary cows , Uncle Mac ? " Uncle Mac snorted noisily . This summer Uncle Mac had purchased a new ma-chine , a swather that could mow the alfalfa and rake it into windrows at the same time . The new machine eliminated one hired man , the reason for the extravagance , although three hired men continued to come daily .  | Because of the heavy dew this morning , they stood around idly , admiring the new swather . At noon they came to the house , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alfalfa clinging to their green-stained overalls . " Is the beefsteak ready , Jada ? " Uncle Mac shouted from the back porch . " That new machine has given us voracious appetites ! " That evening after supper , Uncle Mac extolled the fine features of the new purchase to Jada . " Would you like to go for a ride on it , Jada ? Just for fun ? " " She does n't have time to go joyriding on your machinery , Mac , " Aunt May called shrilly . Jada dropped the plate she was washing . Was Aunt May behind the kitchen door ? " Another time , perhaps ? " Uncle Mac said . Jada nodded . " Guess I will cut the front lawn then , " Uncle Mac said . He pushed his chair back from the table . " Al-though I hate to ruin my lawn mower . That over-grown balm of Gilead sends sprouts up all over the lawn . It 's like mowing a forest . " " Tonight ? " Jada asked . " Tonight , " Uncle Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , it wo n't be cut for the Fourth of July . And we can not celebrate the Fourth in clear con-science with a wild lawn like that in front of our house . " I wish I had the courage to ask a hired man to  | tackle it . But I do n't . So here I go . " Uncle Mac slapped his hands on his knees , then rose heavily from his chair . " Could you use your new swather on it ? " Jada suggested , following him out to the back porch . " Not my new swather . " He chortled . " I do n't want to ruin it . " Aunt May called out . " Do n't worry so much about machinery , Mac . Just cut the lawn with the power mower . Buy a new one if it breaks . " " I 'll cut down that goliath tree first , " Uncle Mac shouted back . " Do n't cut down that balm of Gilead tree , " Aunt May called . " I would die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Uncle Mac outside . Anxiously she walked over to the big tree and looked up into its branches . Feeling foolish . Uncle Mac leaned over the power mower intensely , as if he were part of the machine . Like her father . Like all the Sinclair men , cutting lawns as resolutely as they mowed acres of alfalfa . In command of the earth , Jada thought , watching him . She called out . " Do you have any kind of machine in your Quonset for picking peas ? " " What ? What 's that ? " He put his hand to his ear . " Never mind . " She walked to the back porch for a couple of buckets , and then out to the garden . She was knee-deep in the first crop of peas .  | She was pondering the magnificent green of the pea pods when Daniel Bates appeared in front of her . She was startled . " Who did you think I was " ? he laughed ? " a ghost ? " Jada handed him a bucket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole row needs to be picked before dark . And not the flat ones , just the plump ones . And " ? she looked directly down at Daniel 's feet ? " do not step on the vines . " He stood swinging the bucket . " I went over to see Patsy Wilson last night , " he said . " How is she , with her pretty name and all ? " Jada leaned over the vines . " She is still skin and bones . " " So what was she doing last night ? " " She was sitting on the kitchen table embroidering dish towels . " " On the table ? " Jada tossed a handful of pea pods into his bucket to get him started . " Embroidering dish towels for her hope chest . You know . For her trousseau . All girls do . " He glanced up quickly at Jada . " Do n't you , Jade ? " Jada evaded his question . " I have a box under my bed ? " " All my sisters have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't get married soon , we will have to build on the house just to store the hope chests . "  | " How many dish towels do you think one of those will hold ? " Jada asked . " Oh , around five hundred . I 'd say a good five hundred dish towels . Although you can put things in be-sides dish towels , you know . Pillowcases . Sheets . Crocheted doilies . " " But mostly dish towels " ? Jada frowned ? " with smiling pots and pans in cross-stitch . With little beady eyes in French knots . And the days of the week in running stitch . " She worked faster . " How many do you have in your hope chest , Jade ? " " This will come as one big disappointment to you , Daniel , " Jada said , standing up and looking him straight in the eye , " but I do not have one dish towel in my box . " " What 's in there ? " " Poems . " " Poems ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement . " What man is going to want a box of poems ? I ca n't think of one man I know who would . " Jada winced , thinking about the poems in her box . Poems she had written about her fears and her loneliness . All her foolish concerns . Perhaps dish towels would be a better offering . " I said you would be disappointed . " Daniel turned his bucket over and sat down . And rubbed the back of his neck . " What are you going to do without dish towels ? " he asked .  | " Maybe Patsy Wilson will give me a dozen for a wedding present . " Daniel scoffed . " Rob her own hope chest ? " " If you want dish towels , Daniel , you had better head right over to Patsy Wilson 's house and stop wasting your time here . " " Patsy Wilson is skin and bones . Let me tell you , she is skin and bones . " Daniel shook his head repeatedly . " Yes , but I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems . " And who cared about her poems ? she wondered . Dry farmers worked the land . Worked as if another Depression were just around the corner , sneaking up on them , waiting to get them if they did not work . Daniel was silent for a while , rolling up an empty pod , watching it open again . Then he stood up , his feet crunching a trailing vine . " It does n't make me happy , Jade . The two of us starting out life together with only a box of poems . " " The thought does n't make me happy , either , Daniel Bates , " Jada said . " Not one bit happy . " She lifted her bucket of magnificent green peas and walked toward the house .  | When Jada came in from the garden , Uncle Mac lay stretched out on the rag rugs , his face glowing . " It 's me or that tree , " he sputtered . " Well , it can not be you , " Jada exclaimed , dropping the bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of water . " Maybe you should cut just a small section each night , Uncle Mac . You 'll be able to finish it by the Fourth . " " Finish it or me . " Uncle Mac sipped the water . " It 's looking good , " Jada said . She peered out the south windows into the gathering twilight . " The old homestead is getting a haircut . " " That reminds me , " Uncle Mac said , rubbing his hand up the back of his neck . " I need a haircut  | myself . Guess I 'll be taking a trip into town as soon as I get my first crop of hay up . " " Or if it rains , " Jada added . " It does n't rain unless I tell it to , " Uncle Mac declared . He stood up and walked over to the door , scratching his back against the doorjamb . " What does young Bates want , coming around so often ? You certainly do n't seem to encourage him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Unless he likes to pick peas . " " I doubt that . " Uncle Mac laughed . " But you are doing a good job with the garden , Jada . Aunt May and I appreciate it . " " Thanks , Uncle Mac . You know you are just like my dad , scratching your back like that ? " " Sure I know . All the Sinclairs scratch their backs like this . " " Uncle Mac , " Jada asked suddenly , " do you like cheese and chocolates together ? " " Together ? I like cheese and I like chocolates . By the way , I have not had a chocolate since last Christmas . They are not good for Aunt May , you know . " " I know . But I keep finding them around the house . Cheese in the radio-phonograph console . Chocolates in the bookcase . I thought maybe you had midnight snacks , working such long hours . " " No , Jada . I sleep right through midnight . It must be elves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled . " Have a snack yourself , anytime . "  | The following evening Uncle Mac went back out-side to finish the front lawn , and Jada went out to the garden . She took two buckets , one for Daniel Bates if he showed up . He did . " As soon as you start talking , Daniel , " she said , handing him a bucket , " start picking . " " What is it with you and peas in the pod , Jade Sin-clair ? " he demanded . He stood with both feet in the pea vines . " What it is with peas in the pod , Daniel Bates , is everything . I am the picker and the sheller . The hoer and the waterer . I am all they have . " " You are all the peas have ? " Daniel slapped his forehead and groaned . " Now please , do n't step on the vines , " Jada instructed . " Just lift them up before you step . There is plenty of room for your feet between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Daniel repeated . " And do n't pick the flat ones . You can feel when they are ready . Just the plump ones . " Jada moved down the long row , bending over the tender vines , gleaning the ripened pods . Daniel plodded along behind , slapping his forehead . " God has worked a long time on this pea patch , Daniel . And so have I. And I am not letting one little pea pod go to waste . So if you want to reimburse me from your mother 's garden , just keep stepping on those vines . "  | Jada looked up impatiently . " On second thought , Daniel , why do n't you stand over by the rhubarb ? " Daniel cleared a spot between the vines big enough for his bucket , turned it over , and sat down . He rested his arms on his knees . " I 'll tell you something , Jade girl , " he said . " You would n't last one day at Don and Dora 's Cafe in town . Telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breakfast . Those truckers just want their eggs sunny-side up , and fast . They ca n't be bothered with God 's handiwork or with the layer or the picker or the hoer . " Jada stood and faced Daniel . " I would not be one day at Don and Dora 's because Don and Dora could not pay me enough to be there for one day . Wearing a white nylon dress with a big flowered handkerchief pinned on my chest with a hat pin . Leaning over the counter crooning ' Mornin ' Big Sam ' to every Tom , Dick , and Sam truck driver who does not care at all about the good hen God made or the other side of the egg . Just caring about filling their big bellies and driving their big trucks . " She took a deep breath and frowned . " Patsy Wilson is aching to work at Don and Dora 's after she graduates , " Daniel said . " Let her then . She can even show those truck drivers all her embroidered dish towels . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems ? " Daniel sneered . " What 's wrong with writing poems ? " Daniel shook his head , exasperated . " Do you ever think of anything except writing poems for your hope chest ? " " Of course I do . " " Besides this pea patch that you and God work so hard in ? " " Of course I do . " " Do you ever think of kissing ? " He looked boldly into Jada 's eyes . " Who ? " " Me . You know , the two of us together . " Daniel slapped his forehead again . " Kissing ? No , never . " " Why not ? " Jada lifted her bucket , heavy with peas , and started toward the house . " Good-by , Daniel . I have to go in-side now and work . " " I 'll help you . " He stood up and followed her . Jada turned at the porch step . " Roll Aunt May over in her bed and change her sheets ? " Daniel hesitated . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jada went inside , tired of the garden , tired of Daniel Bates . From the back porch she could see that Uncle Mac had finished cutting the front lawn . She tiptoed into Aunt May 's bedroom , thinking he  | might be dozing in his chair . But he had not come in yet . Aunt May was conscientiously polishing her fin-gernails . " The front lawn looks wonderful , Aunt May , " Jada said , sitting on the bottom of the bed . " You would like it . Do you think maybe you could walk out to see it ? With Uncle Mac and me helping you ? " " Goodness no , Jada , " she exclaimed . " I might have heart failure in the living room  --  with no visiting doctor in Billington and the one in Soda Springs probably on vacation . Oh , I just can not risk it . But I am glad the lawn is cut for the Fourth . " Aunt May held up her hands , blowing on her brightly painted nails . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jada ? " " It 's really shiny ? " " You know the rose is the flower of Aphrodite , do n't you , Jada ? The symbol of love ? " Aunt May smiled merrily . " Do you know who gave me a dozen red roses once ? " Jada shook her head . " Well , it was not Uncle Mac . It was Raymond Riggs , my old high school beau . Before I met Uncle Mac . But do n't tell him , okay ? " Aunt May fluttered her fingers in the direction of Uncle Mac 's chair . " It was for my sixteenth birthday , " she continued . " And now that I think about it , I believe there were sixteen red roses . Not just twelve , but sixteen . " " That is a great name for nail polish  --  Sixteen  | Roses , " Jada commented . " Jada , honey , that is fantastic . Why do n't you write a letter to Max Factor or one of those companies and tell them . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sixteen bottles of fingernail polish ? Aunt May , you write the letter . You are the one who knows about Aphrodite and nail polish . " " Well , maybe I 'll just do that . After I take a quick nap . I am worn out now , just talking about it . " " Aunt May , " Jada said , walking over to the closet door , " should I put your green dress away ? " Aunt May sighed wearily . " Away to a closet , " she said . " But Jada " ? she brightened ? " have I told you about the first time I wore that dress ? " " Tell me , Aunt May , " Jada said . She slipped into Uncle Mac 's chair , the dress folded over her arms . " The first time I wore that dress was to a dance on the Fourth of July . I was young  --  not much older than you are now  --  and I had gone to the dance with my brother and sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a group of his friends were standing up near the front door , looking everyone over . Showing off . " Aunt May leaned back against her pillows . " Well " ? she smiled ? " Mac walked right down the steps to meet me and said in front of everyone , ' You look divine , May Partridge . Absolutely divine . Will you marry me ? '  | " I said , ' Yes , Mac Sinclair , I will . ' " Of course , he would not back down in front of all his friends . Nor would I. " So three weeks later I wore that same dress to my Trousseau Tea . . . " Her voice faded . Jada glanced up and saw that Aunt May 's eyes were moist with tears . Yet she was smiling , recalling her wondrous memory of forty years ago . " It is a wonderful story , Aunt May , " Jada said quietly . " And now I hear Uncle Mac coming this way . I think I will go outside and sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jada honey , " Aunt May said warmly . Jada waited under the balm of Gilead tree . Her heart quickened whenever the leaves rustled , when-ever a bird took flight . Suddenly she was overcome with apprehension . Was she really meeting someone , someone who was ... ? She could not form the thought nor the word . Could Uncle Mac and Aunt May see this some-one from their windows ? Could everyone in Ravens-field see ? Normal people did not see apparitions . But then , she was not normal . She was the lanky , frizzy-haired changeling of the Sinclair family . Who did not want to work at Don and Dora 's in a white nylon dress . Who hid poems in a box under her bed . Who was now regularly seeing a  --  a ghost .  | Daniel Bates would confirm that she was a misfit . And he did not even know about the ghost . In anguish , she jumped up and turned toward the house . As she did , she heard his voice . " Jada Sinclair , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freeman , " she whispered . " The lawn looks divine , " he said . " And I should know . " He laughed . " Last night I almost landed on Uncle Mac 's power mower . Noisy thing . But I made a fast retreat . " They laughed together . Then Starr looked over at the bucket of peas . " Ah  --  fresh green peas in the pod . Food fit for the gods . " He sat down , leaning against the broad tree trunk . Jada sat down beside him . " Starr Freeman " ? her voice trembled ? " tell me , why have you  --  come back ? " Starr looked at her steadily and then said , " I have come to shell peas and to watch the moon come over the mountains with you , Jada Sinclair . " She was transfixed by his penetrating eyes and questioned no more . He was here . It was enough . " I have never seen anyone shell peas like this , " Jada said after a while . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are all these coming from ? " " From Aunt May 's garden , " Starr said , grinning . " The first crop of peas has been harvested , and before  | the Fourth of July , too . " " What will Aunt May think ? " Jada exclaimed . Starr laughed . " Aunt May is a good subject . " " A good subject ? " " For writers . For artists . I thought I would have years to paint her  --  to paint all of them . To paint these pointed hills ... " Jada touched his arm . " I did not know you were an artist , Starr . " " I was n't really . Miss Overmeyer was enthusiastic about my sketches , but . . . " He hesitated . " But ? " Jada asked . " But  --  she was the only one , " Starr said . " She encouraged me , although I knew I could do it anyway . But then , suddenly , it did n't matter . Nothing mattered . Except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after gradua-tion  --  Ed McGee , Lester Firmage . " He stood and walked away . Jada ran to him quickly and walked by his side . " I lost this world , Jada . I did not want to leave it any more than you want to leave right now . I was forced out , prematurely , by a Japanese dive bomber . " I remember thinking that I could not be dead be-cause I had not really lived yet . I looked down at the vast blue Pacific Ocean beneath me  --  the green is-lands of New Guinea  --  and I thought I was still flying in the B-17 . Yet I could see the airplane , broken and in flames in the trees below .  | " And I wanted to put it on canvas  --  paint a brilliant seascape . " " I did not know , Starr , " Jada whispered . " But behold " ? Starr nodded ? " the moon . " They sat again under the tree , watching the moon , round and silver , glide up the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep blue night . Muted sounds stirred the stillness of the night  --  the restless leaves , the flutterings of the songbirds , the distant hollow hooting of an owl . There were many questions Jada wanted to ask Starr , and many things she wanted to tell him . But the night was casting a spell upon her .. . There was too much beauty . The splendor of the night . The majesty of the world . Beautiful , yet .. . A sudden desolate grief surged through her body , and she cried out in the stillness of the night . " I am alone , Starr . You are from another time . Another world . And I am alone here . " She stood and ran across the moon-washed lawn , holding her arms open as if to enclose it all  --  the moon , the stars , the gentle night sounds , and the pun-gent scent of the tree . " Stay here in this world , Starr Freeman , " she cried . " Stay here with me . " She turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer there beside the balm of Gilead tree .  | The Annual Fourth of July Basket Dance at the church approached as close to Society as Ravensfield would ever come . On that night , everyone went to the church on the hill , everyone from the newest child to the grayest grandparent . Except Aunt May Sinclair , who was more concerned with dying . The dry farmers liked to have their spring calves branded , their first crop of hay stacked , and a good rain  --  all before the Fourth . Uncle Mac petitioned for the rain . On the last day of June he walked through his fields , waving his arms and his Stetson . Chanting with his clarion voice : Oh , rain ye now upon these happy fields , Of shorn alfalfa and tender stems of wheat ,  | Awaiting long in sun-drenched rest Thy verdant kiss of life . And it rained for two days . Jada went to the dance with Uncle Mac , taking a red-white-and-blue basket . Upstairs she had found an old grapevine basket , which she decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth celebration . Across the handle she attached red geranium blossoms , and between the blossoms she tied ribbons of red , white , and blue that fell in a cascade over the basket . She fried a chicken and made potato salad . And for dessert she made a rhubarb pie , according to Aunt May 's instructions . She put the whole glorious pie in the top of the basket and covered it with a linen nap-kin . At the last minute she wrote a couplet on a recipe card and fastened it to the handle with a hat pin . Uncle Mac carried the basket , proudly , down the path to the car . He was pleased with himself and the world . His first crop of hay was up , his lawn mowed , and his hair cut . At the gate he stopped and looked at Jada . " It 's an unusual dress you are wearing tonight , Jada . " " Do you recognize it , Uncle Mac ? " Jada whirled in the long green dress . " Aunt May wore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People will stare . "  | " I know . " " And you do n't mind ? " Uncle Mac raised his eye-brows . " I do n't mind if you do n't . " Jada whirled again , up on her toes into a graceful pirouette . " You are a Sinclair , Jada . A real Sinclair . " He pushed open the gate . " Like one of those Greeks said a long time ago , You must wear your rue with a differ-ence . ' " " Except it was Shakespeare , Uncle Mac . Shakespeare said that . " " Of course , " Uncle Mac said . " Shakespeare said it . In Miss Overmeyer 's English class . She still reading Hamlet every year ? " " Every year . " " Well , do n't tell Aunt May . " He lowered his voice . " She will want to go to England this winter . And that will mean more slides to sit through on Sundays : Buckingham Palace , the Changing of the Guard , Big Ben . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jada laughed . " But wait ? " Uncle Mac set the basket down on the hood of the car . " I 'll go back and get my father 's old bowler hat , if I can find it . And Jada , " he added , " if anyone starts bidding for your basket  --  anyone who does not please you just give me a high sign . " " Thanks , Uncle Mac , " Jada said .  | Daniel Bates also requested a high sign , as did two other neighbor boys , Carl and Roger . Whenever Jada looked in their general direction , they shouted bids . Carl and Roger both won baskets belonging to married women , and they were frowning on their bench . Daniel was still without a basket when Jada 's was handed to the bishop at the podium . " This one has a card , " Bishop Cole announced , pulling out the hat pin . " It 's a little verse . Everyone listen . " He read the couplet aloud : Inside you will find a rhubarb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we die ! A hushed silence fell over the hall . Uncle Mac looked across at Jada and raised his eyebrows . Bishop Cole read the card again , slowly . Then he exclaimed , " This is not sacrilege , folks . This is right out of the Bible . " And the bidding began . Daniel Bates scratched his head and pulled his ear , but Jada made no high sign in return . The bidding climbed to $5.50 , the usual price for a basket , and it looked as if Carl 's older brother Duke would bid six . Suddenly , from the back of the hall a voice called out . " Fifty dollars ! " The room was silent . Bishop Cole at the podium was speechless . All heads turned to the back of the hall .  | On the back bench , Mrs. Freeman leaned forward to get a good look at her husband . She jabbed him with her patent leather purse . " Are you crazy ? " she exclaimed . Everyone stared at Mr. Freeman . He looked at Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jada peered anxiously around the hall , looking for Starr . She saw him , moving behind the back bench , looking pleased with himself . Patsy Wilson , sitting next to her , snickered . " Guess you get old Mr. Freeman , Jada . But then " ? she looked askance ? " you will make a fine pair with your  --  your funny old dress . " Again Starr shouted his bid , sounding just like his father . " Fifty dollars ! " Bishop Cole brought down the gavel . " Sold to Hy Freeman for the extravagant amount of fifty dollars . " The congregation gasped in unison . Mrs. Freeman whirled her purse at her husband . " He is crazy , " she cried . Mr. Freeman sprang to his feet and marched up to the podium for the basket . Still bewildered . " Who is my pretty little lady tonight ? " he called out . Bishop Cole announced , " If the owner of this patriotic and heavy basket will please stand ... " Mr. Freeman looked around the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and shouted , " I 'm the luckiest dry farmer in the world tonight . "  | Jada smiled at him . And everyone applauded  --  with the exception of Mrs. Freeman . After the auction , the congregation scattered around the church with their picnic baskets  --  to the classrooms , to the cloakroom , and to the stairways . Jada and Mr. Freeman  --  and Starr  --  went outside and sat on the front steps . Jada looked at Starr , questioning . He simply smiled in return . The midsummer twilight , warm and languid , eased around them . Across the road the cemetery hill shimmered under the last rays of the hidden sun . " It looks beautiful at twilight , " Jada exclaimed . " Beautiful and ethereal . " Mr. Freeman followed her gaze , nodding . " I look over there every night , " he said . " My boy 's over there . Shot down by Japanese fighters over New Guinea during the war . He was too young to die , too young to go to war ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at Starr , who was listening intently to his father . " He enlisted at eighteen , when the draft age was lowered about the middle of the war . He was a gunner on a B ? 17 bomber . He flew over all those islands in the Pacific , getting shot at , shooting back . Defending his country . " Mr. Freeman rubbed his hand through his gray hair . " It is a terrible thing to go to war at eighteen . To be killed at nineteen . He came home , a hero in a  | casket . " Mr. Freeman sighed heavily . " Part of me has been over on that hill ever since . You never get over a thing like that . Never . " But " ? he lifted the napkin from the top of the basket ? " young folks do n't want to hear about things before their time , especially ? " " I want to hear about it , " Jada said . He looked surprised . " Of course , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the store for your aunt while I am out cutting alfalfa . Minding my own business , understand . " Starr smiled fondly at his father and leaned back against the brick wall . " Oh , many girls walk up to the store , " Mr. Freeman continued . " Many . But they do n't take the long way home around by the cemetery . " Jada smiled . And Mr. Freeman smiled . " A whole pie ? " Mr. Freeman set the pie on the step . " How many were you expecting at this basket , Miss Jada ? " " It was too beautiful to cut , " Jada said shyly . " Also I was afraid maybe the rhubarb would spill out if I did . It 's my first pie . " " It looks like perfection on the first try , " Mr. Free-man said , turning the pie around on the step . " Do n't know if I have the heart to cut it either . " Jada dished up the fried chicken and potato salad on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy Starr had a steady girl , " Mr. Freeman said after a few minutes . " Rosanne Sinclair . Your cousin . " " I know . Aunt May still talks about it . " " All this land I have " ? Mr. Freeman spread his arms wide ? " was for him . And it wo n't be long before I 'm too old to farm . " " Do you think he would have wanted  --  all your land , Mr. Freeman ? " Jada asked . " I mean , maybe he wanted to do something else . Be something else . An artist , perhaps . " Mr. Freeman looked at her curiously . " Strange you would say that , " he said . " One of his schoolteachers , Miss  --  Miss ? " " Miss Overmeyer ? " " Miss Overmeyer  --  was always telling us that . Telling us he should be an artist . Go away to art school . But , no " ? he chuckled ? " my boy rode at my side . A dry farmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starr . He stood , his back toward them , looking down over Ravensfield Valley . " My boy gave his life for his country , " Mr. Freeman continued wistfully . " He 's a hero . That is the only compensation . Has his name on a bronze monument in front of the City Hall . " " I read his name every time I pass by , " Jada said . " It is a nice monument . As nice as a monument can be , " she added . " My boy , a war hero , " Mr. Freeman repeated . " And  | I keep thinking he is going to take over the dry farm one of these days . Ca n't get used to his being a hero . " A loud piano chord sounded from inside the hall , a signal that the dance would soon begin . As the musicians gathered at the piano , the benches were pushed back to the walls , and cornmeal scattered across the floor . The orchestra warmed up raucously  --  Masie Mac-Entire at the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternating between fiddle and saxophone . All by ear . All from the heart . Masie MacEntire , bulging in a brightly flowered muumuu dress , leaned over close to the microphone at the side of the piano . " Okay folks , " she announced with fervor , " let 's start dancing . Get your partners for the Virginia reel ! " Daniel Bates dashed down the front steps , followed by Carl and Roger . " Here you are , Jade , " he called . " Hurry up . The dance is starting . " " We are still eating , " Jada said , waving them off . " I 'll be in later . " The boys gave high signs behind Mr. Freeman 's back , rolling eyes and pulling ears . Jada ignored them . Starr wandered inside to watch the orchestra set up , then came back outside and sat down on the top step . He reached for Jada 's hand , and together they leaned back against the warm , red bricks of the church . They smiled as Mr. Freean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , and who had died a war hero . They listened to the pulsating music of Ravensfield , entertaining its young , sustaining its old , and calling home all its departed . It was more than music to dance to , Ravensfield music . It was a paean of honor to the departed . And for the living , a reinforcement of their pact with life . Listening to the surging music , Jada could almost understand how it would be possible for a dancing couple to forget a baby sleeping in the cloakroom . As the silver moon slid across the night sky , the Ravensfield orchestra played slower and slower . All too soon the melody of the last dance began . Masie MacEntire spoke softly into the microphone . " And now ? ' Goodnight , Sweetheart . In the pale moonlit night , Jada , Starr , and Mr. Free-man sat out the last dance on the top step of the church . " You would have liked my boy , " Mr. Freeman said , looking into the night . " And " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Liked you very much . " He sighed , then turned to Jada . " Cute as a bug you are in your aunt 's old party dress . " " Thank you , Mr. Freeman . " Jada put her arm around his shoulder . " I know I would have liked your son . I would have liked him very much . "  | That Fourth of July night in Ravensfield Jada would remember always . She could have sat forever on the church steps , listening to the haunting melodies of the orchestra , listening to the gentle memories of Mr. Freeman . Because Starr Freeman was there with her . But day follows night . And in Ravensfield it was a rainy day . Rain fell for five continuous days . Uncle Mac fussed with his machinery in the Quonset and looked through mail-order catalogs with Aunt May . Con-tented . " When will this rain stop ? " Jada asked in exasperation . She sat on Aunt May 's bed , looking out the  | misty bedroom window . Only the red poppies pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray world . " Soon , " Uncle Mac answered . " As soon as the alfalfa understands it is to start growing again , and the green wheat decides it is time to ripen . It will stop soon . " The first day of the rain , Aunt May asked Jada to bring out her white satin sheets and her fuchsia bed jacket , and to wash her hair . After the hair washing , Jada had to change Aunt May and herself . But Aunt May looked divine , just in time for visitors . In fact , since all the visitors arrived wet and wrinkled , Aunt May looked better than anyone . Jada collected umbrellas at the front door and kept the floor mop handy . She served cupcakes and Posturn . And she sat next to Uncle Mac and enjoyed the company . Aunt May was genuinely entertaining , and she had the visitors in fine spirits before they left , whether they had their first crop of hay stacked or not . " You are a vision of springtime , May , " Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no time at all . No time at all . " " I am happy you think so , " Aunt May murmured . The Freemans arrived , somber and wet , with neither umbrellas nor galoshes . Jada followed them with the mop to Aunt May 's bedroom . " It has been sixteen years , May , " Mrs. Freeman  | said as soon as she was seated . She propped her patent leather purse on her lap , then folded her arms over it . " And it seems like only yesterday . " Aunt May sank into her pillows . Uncle Mac and Mr. Freeman nodded their heads solemnly . " I relived it all again at the dance the other night , " Mr. Freeman said . " Seemed as if young Jada here was your Rosanne . She looks just like her . " " She does n't look a thing like Rosanne , " Mrs. Free-man said emphatically . " Tall with frizzy hair ? I have been telling Hyram that for two days , but he just keeps thinking it was Rosanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at Jada and frowned . " She has Rosanne 's ways , " Uncle Mac said kindly . " Rosanne was a beauty , " Mrs. Freeman declared . She heaved a sigh , and continued with difficulty . " They were so much in love  --  and so young  --  with so much to look forward to . How could the good Lord let it happen to our Starr ? " Mrs. Freeman wept openly . And although she accepted the handkerchief Mr. Freeman offered , she twisted it between her fingers and let her tears roll down her thin cheeks . Mr. Freeman cleared his throat . " Is she coming home this summer ? We always look forward to her visits . Just as if she were our own daughter . " " We have always considered her our daughter , " Mrs. Freeman added . " Starr would have wanted us to . "  | " She is coming home the end of this month , " Uncle Mac said , " with her husband and children . " " You understand , " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine man . But there will never be any-one except Starr . " " Of course , we know she was heartbroken , " Mrs. Freeman said . " But what else could a young girl do ? Trying to piece her life together " Oh , it was a shock , that telegram , " she continued . " I will never forget it . I was home alone when Mr. Blakely called from town . I knew what was in that telegram before he read it . He knew also , and his voice was trembling . He said , ' I am afraid I have bad news for you , Mrs. Freeman . Is your husband in ? ' And I said , ' No , Mr. Blakely , just read it to me . Mr. Freeman reached over and touched her hand . " And our boy Starr " ? his voice was muffled ? " his name on a bronze monument in front of the City Hall . And a gold star for our window . That is all . " Jada looked in anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac , Mrs. Freeman and Mr. Freeman . All closed faces . And she realized that this same conversation had been repeated before , this same scene played before . Many , many times . She slid from her chair . " Excuse me , " she whispered , leaving the room . No one seemed to notice . She wandered through the big house , trying to rid herself of the unconsolable sadness that had settled upon her . The rooms loomed austere and silent . She  | walked out to the back porch , watching the rain through the screen door . Falling cold and heartless . She ran into her bedroom and lay down on the disheveled bed . A corner of the rose bedspread hung over one side , brushing the floor , so that any little mouse who wanted to could run up and dance over her body . She did not care . The portraits on the bureau were smiling , the way they had always smiled at each other . Beautiful Rosanne Sinclair with her raven-black hair and cherry red lips . And Starr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had defied the boundaries of the grave , searching for Rosanne , his beloved . Jada closed the double picture frame and slipped it into the top drawer .  | After the rain everyone returned to normal . At least everyone appeared normal , having once again tucked away memories in the safe places of the heart . Jada decided to forget that she had ever encountered Starr Freeman . After all , if a normal person sees an apparition , that person must be working too hard . And she had other matters to attend to . An old fear to confront . A suspicion that maybe she was not really Jada Sinclair at all . The real Jada Sinclair would be smart . The real Jada Sinclair would have known that Starr Freeman was only trying to find his way to Rosanne , his lost love . At supper , Jada asked Uncle Mac , " Do Gypsies pass  | through Ravensfield at night , along the old Oregon Trail ? " " Gypsies ? " Uncle Mac looked up quizzically . " I have never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the old trail anymore . " " What about sixteen years ago ? " " No . Not likely . " He shook his head . " What about tourists ? " " In all my sixty-odd years here , " Uncle Mac said , leaning back in his chair , " I have never seen a tourist . Not much for a tourist to see . Just a few fishermen in the summertime . And duck hunters in the fall , climbing over my fences , disturbing my Greek Beauties . " Oh " ? Uncle Mac sat up straight . " Once a deer hunter shot the horse from under Rex Higgins , bringing home his milch cows . The horse just fell over in the middle of the road . " Uncle Mac chuckled . " So did Rex Higgins . But he got up again . " " What about March ? " Jada persisted . " In March with snow up to the rooftops ? " Uncle Mac snorted . " Just the locals , because they are usually snowed in . No tourists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned . Maybe she was Patsy Wilson . And Patsy Wilson was Jada Sinclair . She collapsed back into her chair , the new idea pounding inside her head . Could a Sinclair , even a Sinclair changeling , ever be skin and bones ? Could Patsy Wilson 's condition be attributed not to birth but to Mrs. Wilson 's cooking ? Everyone knew she bought  | Wonder bread in Billington . TV dinners and frozen fish sticks . Snatches of conversations came rushing back to Jada , indistinct and distorted . But the meaning was becoming clear : People in Ravensfield would do al-most anything to marry a Sinclair . And if someone , one of the Wilsons who danced after midnight , had a perfect opportunity to exchange babies She laughed aloud  --  a helpless laugh . " Are you worried about something , Jada ? " Uncle Mac looked directly at her . " You must be working too hard . At the end of the month you can go home for a couple of weeks , and rest . " Jada shook herself to regain her composure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac ? " " Of course not . Not on my wheat that is heading out . " He jumped up and walked over to the kitchen sink and looked out the window . " But just in case ... " He strained his neck in a westerly direction until his face was crimson . And he implored the fading sun : " Smile now , thou Golden Orb , upon yon waving wheat . Once fallow , restive , it quickens to thy heat ; And ... " And what , Uncle Mac ? "  | " And . . . " Uncle Mac moved over to the doorway and began scratching his back against the doorjamb . " And it is n't going to rain , " he said . " Rosanne will be here , and she can help her mother . " " That will be nice for everyone , " Jada said absently as she carried dishes to the sink . " Wheat heading out , Rosanne coming , Jada going crazy . " She thought of calling Daniel Bates and telling him that the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She decided she would try to appreciate Daniel for himself . Perhaps even like him . After all , he had been proving his love for over ten years . And he was real flesh and blood . The following day , without a telephone call , Daniel appeared at the screen door . " Anybody home ? " he shouted . " I 'm right here , Daniel , " Jada said cheerfully , " ironing pillowcases about two feet from the screen door , about two feet from where you are shouting . " He opened the screen , then let it slam shut . " You a weirdo or something , Jade Sinclair ? " Jada braced herself . " Watch your language , Daniel Bates , around this house , " she said . " There are some words the Sinclairs do not use , and one of them you just said . " Daniel confronted Jada across the ironing board , his face grim . " Well , my dad says maybe you should take to the sickbed and Aunt May get up and wait on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . "  | " Oh ? " Perhaps it was just his father Jada disliked . " Kissing trees now . Throwing your arms around that big balmy willow tree and kissing it like a weirdo . My dad said you came flying out of Aunt May 's house like a bat out of ' you know where , ' as the Sinclairs would say , and ran right over to that tree in plain sight of the road where my dad was passing by on his horse , and kissed that tree . " " What 's wrong with kissing a tree ? " Daniel gasped . And slapped his forehead . " You love that tree ? " " I love that tree . " " Shame , Jade . Shame is all I can say to you . " Daniel emphasized each word with a shake of his forefinger . " And that 's a religious tree , too . " " Just about as religious as some folks I know . " Jada ironed faster . " What do you mean by that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious as some folks I know . " Daniel slapped his forehead again and rolled his eyes upward . " My dad says you 're crazy and all the Sinclairs are crazy , too ! " Jada propped up the iron and leaned over the ironing board . Trembling . Was this the way of plain love ? " That 's the last straw , Daniel Bates , " she said . " The Sinclairs may be crazy , but we are not stupid . " " Oh , yeah ? Whose mother and father forgot their own baby on the church bench ? "  | " Mine , " she shouted , " and that 's crazy . Just as I said . " Daniel shook his head and his finger and waved his arms , all at the same time . " Well , I ca n't marry into a crazy family . We have enough problems of our own without crazies . " " And too stupid to solve them , " Jada retorted . " We solve our problems fast , so we can do any crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are having our first quarrel , Jade , " Daniel said , lowering his arms and gripping the edge of the ironing board . " Our first and our last , " Jada said . " So go home Daniel Bates , and do n't come down here again . Ever ! " " If your folks could hear you talking like this , Jade Sinclair , they would wish they had left you on that church bench permanently . " Daniel sneered into Jada 's face . " Now I guess I 'll go see Patsy Wilson . She is no tree-kissing weirdo . " He lurched toward the screen door . Jada followed , and caught the door with her foot before it slammed shut . She shrugged hopelessly . It was not only Daniel Bates 's father she did not like . She did not lik Daniel Bates .  | In late July Uncle Mac 's second crop of alfalfa was knee-high and in early purple bloom ; his fields of golden wheat brushed his shoulders . Aunt May 's pea patch was in full bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusely . Her forty geranium plants on the windowsills , however , were turning yellow and dropping their leaves . " The geraniums are dying , " Aunt May announced , early one Monday morning . " I will water them first thing , " Jada said , surprised . She had watered them just before she left on Friday . " That 's the reason they are dying , " Aunt May said . " Too much water . " Jada plucked off the wilted leaves and blossoms of all forty geraniums . She tried to keep herself busy  | around the house . Frantically busy , so that she would have no time to think of Starr Freeman . Starr Free-man , whom she had decided to forget . The following evening as she was gathering sweet peas in the front yard for Aunt May , she suddenly felt his presence . She whirled around and saw him walking across the lawn toward her . Calling to her . " Jada . Jada Sinclair . " Jada drew back , clutching the flowers fiercely . " Rosanne " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waco , Texas . " Starr looked at her in surprise , his smile fading . Although it pained her to see him so , in frustration Jada lashed out again . " You can save yourself a trip , however . She is coming home to visit next week . You can see her , her sailor husband , and her two children also . Here , in her old home . " Jada trembled , and the flowers in her hands broke into pieces and fell to her feet . " Now , Starr Freeman , what else do you want to know ? " Starr seemed dazed , searching Jada 's face . Then he said , more to himself than Jada , " I had forgotten about jealousy , almost forgotten it . " He moved closer to Jada . " I have something to tell you , Jada . I ? " Jada stepped back , shaking her head . " Go away , Starr Freeman . Go away and let me be normal again . " She turned from him , fleeing across the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he called . But she did not answer . She ran inside the back porch and leaned against the door , breathing painfully . She slumped down onto the floor , gasping for air . Dizzy . She had written poems about unrequited love just like Sara Teasdale , and she had enjoyed every minute of it . Merciful tears had slipped down her cheeks , falling gently upon the blue-flowered stationery . She had loved those tears , every one . But this was real , and there were no tears to soothe her sorrow . And no blue-flowered stationery . Just silent weeping in her lonely heart . Rosanne arrived in a big red Buick with her husband , Hank , and two children . She was as beautiful as Miss America with a new bouffant hair style . The children  --  Sugar , age fourteen , and Sam , age ten  --  were fair-skinned and freckled , resembling their husky , blond father . They all smelled like French fries . They scattered their suitcases and shopping bags all over the house , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French fry odor . After , Jada went into the bathroom to open the window for ventilation . She groped her way through the mist , stumbling over damp towels on the floor . She groaned . " What 's wrong with you ? "  | Jada looked up , startled . Sugar sat on the vanity with her feet in the wash-basin , her face pressed to the mirror . " What are you doing ? " Jada asked . " What do you think I 'm doing ? " Sugar retorted . " I am applying my makeup . " " Are you blind ? " Sugar did not answer , just kept her face pressed to the mirror . Jada shrugged . She opened the window over the bathtub , picked up the damp towels , and carried them out to the washer on the back porch . Later , she carried the washing out to the clothes-lines . And there she saw the entire family out in Aunt May 's vegetable garden . They were pulling it up , shrieking at the size of the carrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pea vines . Jada dropped the laundry basket and rushed over . " Do n't step on the vines , " she called . " It ruins all the new peas . " She looked imploringly at Uncle Mac , who stood near the rhubarb , clearly dismayed . He smiled feebly . " So , Jada , we already have a freezer full of peas . What 's a garden for if it is n't to entertain your grandchildren ? " Jada shrugged again , surprised . She left the revelers in the garden and went inside to see how Aunt May was holding up . After all , she was not getting  | paid to criticize . But she did wonder about people from Waco , Texas . " Would you like me to stay and clean up after them ? " Jada asked Aunt May . She gathered up a broken geranium plant that had been knocked off the windowsill . " Oh no , Jada , honey , " Aunt May said breathlessly . Her face was almost as red as the geranium blossoms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandchildren to enjoy ? " Jada nodded , smiling weakly . That evening , as Jada waited for her mother to come for her , she went to her bedroom to get her suit-case , already packed at the door . Rosanne was there , resting on the bed . Worn out from gardening , Jada supposed . Jada had made the bed earlier , with the bedspread corners trailing to the floor . She thought perhaps she should say something to Rosanne about the mice , but she did not . After all , this was Rosanne 's bedroom . She had lived here for nineteen years . She visited here every summer . If she did not know about the mice by now , Jada decided she was not going to be the one to tell her . " I just came for my suitcase , " Jada whispered , knocking on the open door . " Oh , come in and visit with me , " Rosanne said , sitting up . " Until your mother arrives . " She stood up  | and began unpacking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually dropping black lace underwear and gold-lame bikinis into drawers . " It is really good of you to help with Mother this summer , Jada . Until she is on her feet again . " She flashed a coy smile . " And we all know it is next to impossible to get any help way out here . Just old Miss Millie , who does next to nothing at all . " She opened the top drawer of the bureau and lifted out the double picture frames . " Oh " ? she frowned ? " here are these pictures again . I put them away in the closet last summer , and here they are again this summer . " " Aunt May likes them on top of the bureau , " Jada said . " It is a beautiful picture of you , Rosanne . " " But it is in this double frame with Starr Freeman , " she said . " It is absolutely embarrassing . He was  --  he was ? " " I know , " Jada said . She sat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that you were engaged to be married . And that he was killed in the war . " She hesitated . " Did you love him with all your heart , Rosanne ? " " Not really , " Rosanne said , giving the drawer a push . She sat on the bed , holding the pictures in her lap . " Everyone became engaged during the war . It was the thing to do . " She laughed softly . " In fact , I proposed to Starr . And he said okay and bought a ring . A ring with four little diamonds . Very little  | diamonds , I should say . " " You must have liked him if ? " " Of course , I liked him very much . You can see how handsome he is . And he was just that good , too . " Rosanne smiled softly . " All the girls liked him . They all envied me . " She tossed the pictures on the bed . " But it was never real love  --  not for Starr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Oh , not eyeing other girls  --  I do n't mean that ? " " What do you mean ? " Jada asked . " Oh " ? Rosanne faltered ? " it is difficult to explain . He was always looking for someone he knew before . ' Before when ? ' I would ask . " ' Just before , ' he would say . " I would laugh at him . " He would not mention it then for a while . But he always looked at me as if I should be someone else . " She glanced down at the double pictures , wistfully . " How do you think that made me feel ? " Jada moved over to the bed and sat down by Rosanne . She tried to keep her voice steady . " Tell me more , Rosanne , " she said softly . " That 's about it , " Rosanne said . " Starr enlisted in the Army Air Corps when he turned eighteen , and I joined the WACs . Later I met Hank at a canteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . For one thing , he did not bother me with crazy questions like Starr. "  | Rosanne paused . " I wrote Starr , so he knew . I re-turned the ring . When I heard his plane had gone down , I felt sorry , of course . But I did not mourn , if you want to know the truth . I was too happy with Hank to mourn for anyone . " " You did not grieve for Starr Freeman ? " Jada looked anxiously into Rosanne 's face . Rosanne flushed . " I have always felt a little guilty about it , because of the timing . " " I see , " Jada said . She touched Starr 's picture gently . " My parents did n't see , " Rosanne continued . " Nor Mr. and Mrs. Freeman . They still go on pretending . But I could not ruin my life just because Starr was killed . After all , there was a war going on . Oh " ? she took the pictures and pushed them back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " " I understand , " Jada said , rising from the bed . " Maybe you should put the pictures away in the closet again . And look for a single frame for your picture . It is a beautiful picture of you . " Rosanne pushed the drawer shut . " I never want to see those pictures again . " She flung herself on the bed and held her bouffant hair . " I will put them in the closet later , " Jada said . She opened the drawer and gently lifted out the pictures . She smiled at Starr Freeman . " He needs someone , " Jada said softly , " someone ? " " Now do n't you make me feel guilty . " Rosanne sat  | up abruptly . " I get enough of that every time I come home . " She turned her head toward the door . " Is n't that your mother I hear in the living room ? " Jada nodded absently . She replaced the pictures and closed the drawer . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She carried her suitcase to the living room . " I 'll be just one minute , Mother , " she said . And she ran up the stairs to the ballroom . It was Starr Freeman who needed comforting . It was Starr Freeman who was looking for someone . Looking for her . Jada opened the ballroom door expectantly . " Starr , " she whispered . " Starr Freeman . " She ran to both windows . Outside the balm of Gilead tree swayed in a gentle wind . A far-reaching branch brushed its heart-shaped leaves against the windows . " Where are you , Starr Freeman ? " she called . " Where are you ? " She called his name over and over again . She dropped down onto a leather footstool , under the windows , and covered her face with her hands . She wept for Starr Freeman . And for herself , Jada Sinclair . Jada Sinclair  --  whose eyes were unseeing , whose lips were mute , and whose heart was ever wandering . Alone . " I am a stranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a stranger here . "  | At home , Jada felt almost her normal self again , although her heart ached for Starr Freeman . Although her heart ached for Jada Sinclair . What was she to do with her life ? Other girls seemed to know what to do . Why did n't she ? Other girls graduated from high school , worked at Don and Dora 's , and with hope chests overflowing married neighborhood boyfriends . But what would she do ? Go away to college with her box of poems ? And then come back and work at Don and Dora 's ? And be lonely ? She had heard of women in the valley who married men they had disliked in childhood . Dull boys who turned out to be intelligent , rich dry farmers . Could any of those women have known a Daniel Bates ?  | Her mother told her to rest and relax for two weeks , completely disregarding any Depression around the corner . With everyone else working at top speed , however , Jada did not enjoy reading poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . She went with her family to the hay fields each morning , taking turns at the mower , the rake , and the baler . At noon they sat in the shade of a tractor and ate lunch , and in the evening Jada and her mother cooked supper , while her father , Tim , and Mandy did the nightly chores . " Do you know you are good children ? " Jada re-marked to Tim and Mandy one night at supper . " We are ? " they both replied . " You are , " Jada repeated . " You hang up your wet towels in the bathroom . You do n't step on pea vines . " Everyone stopped eating and looked at Jada . " The whole family is nice , " Jada added . She looked around the table at her parents , Mandy , and Tim . " Can you give another example ? " Tim asked . " For one thing , " Jada said , " we do n't hide chocolates behind the World Books . " " Chocolates behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief . " Who would ? " " Other people , " Jada answered . " Well , I am going to check just to make sure , " Tim said , pushing back his chair . He ran over to the book-shelves in the living room . " Nothing here , " he complained .  | " Just as I said . " Jada smiled . Jada 's mother and father exchanged meaningful glances . " Other people have reasons for doing what they do , " her mother said . " But they are good people . We are all good people here . " " I know that , Mother , " Jada said . " I know that . " Two weeks later the good people from Waco , Texas , packed their big Buick and headed home , leaving a trail of disarray behind . Aunt May lay wilting on her pillows . " Start any-where , Jada , " she whispered hoarsely . " Anywhere at all . But first  --  my digitalis . " Uncle Mac shook his head over the vegetable gar-den , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't waste water on it , " he said . He threw away a broken pea vine , then headed toward the barn . In the afternoon Jada wandered , discontented , through the quiet rooms of the house , then outside , walking barefoot across the front lawn . She sat beneath the verdant shelter of the balm of Gilead tree and waited uneasily . But no one came . Still restless , she returned to the house and climbed the stairs to the ballroom . She would call to him . Make him hear . She wound the gramophone and played the old record . She walked across the room to the windows  | and gazed into the deep greenness of the big tree . She called his name , over and over again . But Starr Free-man did not come . With a heavy heart , she walked back down the stairs and into Aunt May 's bedroom . Aunt May still looked wilted . " Would a new magazine help you feel better , Aunt May ? " Jada asked . Magazines always made Aunt May feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill . At the general store she bought a McCall 's and a Redbook , tossed them into a paper sack , and walked over to the cemetery hill . On the way , she stopped at the old log cabin , where wild yellow roses bloomed as radiantly as the lilacs had in June . Enraptured , she gathered all she could carry . She walked slowly up the narrow , rutty road to the cemetery , nodding into the yellow blossoms . Heady with their fragrance . At the top of the hill she climbed over the wooden gate and entered the cemetery . She walked past the Oregon Trail graves , past the Attwoods and the Sinclairs . She lingered at Great-Aunt Willa 's small granite headstone . " You wo n't be lonely much longer , Aunt Willa , " she whispered . " Not much longer . " She tossed her a rose . " Jada Sinclair . " Jada whirled around . She saw Starr , barely visible under the swaying boughs of the weeping willow tree . " Starr Freeman . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she called , breathlessly , parting the willow boughs . She searched his face , longing for his smile . " I brought you these wild roses . " " I love stolen roses , " Starr said . " Put them here , on top of my headstone . " He leaned against the trunk of the tree , his arms at his back . Jada released the roses from her arms , and they fell in a yellow cascade upon the granite stone . " Starr Freeman " ? she spoke rapidly ? " I have been selfish and jealous without realizing it and ? " " Jada Sinclair ? " " And sometimes I feel so confused , so insignificant . Sometimes I feel ? " " Mortal , Jada , " Starr said . " And sometimes mortals talk too much . " Jada sighed in despair . " As you know , " Starr continued , " I travel consider-ably , as I have tried to tell you at different times . " He motioned for her to sit . " Let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secluded by the low trailing branches . " A short time ago I paid a visit to your Grandfather Attwood with the curly hair , " Starr began . Jada drew back , ill at ease in the presence of her fears , her overpowering little fears . " My Grandfather Attwood ? " " I told him you had inherited his hair . He said it should look better on you than it had on him . " Starr chuckled .  | " How did you know ? " Jada was bewildered . He smiled . " In this condition , one knows . And you will be happy to learn that during the entire year of 1944 there was not one case of an infant changeling . " Jada gasped . " I did not ask you  --  I did not know you could . Why ? " " You were worrying too much , " Starr said . " A tire-some characteristic of mortals . " Jada wanted to laugh . She wanted to cry . " I am not Patsy Wilson , " she whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones . I am not a changeling . " " Of course not . It is another good story , Jada . Distinctively mortal . And distinctively yours . " He leaned toward her . " And your hair is all right , too . " " I am normal . " Jada sang with joy . " I did not say normal . " " But my real self , " she said . " Yes , your own self . " Jada reached over and touched his hand . " I thank you , Starr . I thank you with all my heart . " " And thank you , Jada , for the roses . " They sat quietly for a while . Then Jada asked , as she had so many times , " Starr Freeman , is there anything I can do for you ? " He shook his head slowly . " Anything at all ? " Jada whispered . " And remember , I can not read your mind . " " You brought me wild roses , " he said softly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " there  | are no wild roses in Heaven . " He stood and reached for Jada . He tucked her hand in the bend of his arm , and they walked together around the cemetery . As they passed Great-Aunt Willa 's grave , Jada said , " She wo n't be lonely much longer . Great-Uncle Warren is getting old , but so is his wife , Aunt Grace . Aunt Grace does n't want Uncle Warren to die before she does . To see Aunt Willa first , you know . But yet , she does not want to die first . She does not want to die at all , really . She is worrying herself mad over it . " " Sounds mortal , " Starr said . " Sounds like Rosanne telling all us boys to go enlist . To win the war and come home heroes . She wanted to marry a war hero . " " Rosanne ? " Starr nodded . " Mortals ! " They stood on the crest of the cemetery hill over-looking Ravensfield Valley : the pointed sagebrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorious green and golden fields , rolling around the hills ; the broken imprint of the old Oregon Trail on the rocky , uncultivated hillsides ; toy-size tractors and combines , and redbrick houses . Miniature people . And encircling it all with protective arms , imperial snowcapped mountains . " A landscape painting , Jada , " Starr said . " I have thought of something you might like to know , " Jada said , looking up at Starr . " Everyone in Ravensfield loves you . Because you are a hero who  | did not return . And so you will always be a hero . And you will always be nineteen years old . Never old and humped and grouchy like Uncle Warren . " Jada paused . " That means a great deal to the people in Ravensfield . To mortals . If you ever feel lonely , you can think of that . And also you can know " ? her voice trembled ? " I love you , Starr Freeman . " Starr put his hands on Jada 's shoulders , looking in-tensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He dropped his hands , turned , and walked briskly toward the weeping willow tree . " Now I am talking like a mortal . I must go . Good-by , Jada . Thank you again for the splendid roses . " " Will I see you again ? " Jada called , running after him . " I must see you again . " As he reached the bending branches of the tree , Starr turned toward her for a brief moment and then was gone . Daniel Bates hailed Jada from the side of the road , where he sat on an outcropping of lava rock . " Hey , Jade . Ca n't you see where you 're going ? Where have you been , anyway ? " Jada looked up , startled . She had been absorbed in her own thoughts since leaving the cemetery , and she had not noticed him . " I have been up to the store buying magazines for Aunt May , " she said , irritated by the interruption . " I heard you quit your job at Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly . " I was home for two weeks while Rosanne and Hank were here . That 's all . I am working until school starts . " " Say , Jade , " Daniel called . He jumped up and ran after her . " What are you going to do with all the money you are making this summer ? " Jada twirled the magazine sack . " First , Daniel , I will buy a typewriter . Then I will buy a headstone and see that it is engraved properly . That should take most of it . " Daniel stepped in front of Jada , blocking her . " What 's with the typewriter , Jade ? You going to type something to the world ? " " Perhaps , " Jada answered . " And what 's with the headstone ? You dying too , like Aunt May ? " He clutched his faded F.F.A. T-shirt at the neck and feigned choking . " Everyone is dying . " " Not me . Not Daniel Bates . " " You are one day closer to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped around Daniel and continued walking . Daniel moved along at her side . " What are you going to engrave on your headstone , Jade ? ' Good-by Cruel World ' ? " He snickered and rolled his eyes upward . " Now that is something you will never know ,  | Daniel . Never . " " That is morbid , Jade . Plain morbid . " " Depends on how you look at it , " Jada answered . " When you know you are dying , you begin living . You begin looking at people you love a little closer , looking at the wild roses , looking at the green trees . " " Kissing trees ? No thank you . I 'm kissing Patsy Wilson nowadays . And she was never left on a church bench ! " Daniel grinned triumphantly . Jada stopped abruptly , kicking up a curly cloud of dust . She was never again going to worry about that church bench story . It had been an immature , al-though romantic , act of her young parents . Forgivable . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now to tell Daniel Bates . She looked directly at Daniel . Daniel Bates , who could grow up to be an intelligent , rich dry farmer someday . But until then " If I were you , Daniel Bates , " she said , " I would stop telling that story . " " Why ? " Daniel snickered . " First , because I am tired of hearing it . And sec-ondly " ? she paused ? " I remember when you had your preschool shots . We all stood in line in City Hall while the county nurse gave us the shots . You cried and kicked the nurse , until finally one of the mothers held you over her knees while she pulled down your  | overalls and gave it to you where it was softer ? " " You ca n't remember that ! " " I certainly can . " Daniel stepped in front of Jada , glaring . " You wo n't tell it around , will you ? " Jada shrugged . " It all depends , Daniel . It all de-pends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine sack , walked away . No one could ever dim the real Jada Sinclair again .  | Ravensfield in August was hot and wrinkled . The dry farmers were bringing in their wheat harvest , their two-ton trucks crowned with golden grain , the tall elevators in Billington overflowing . Uncle Mac was reveling in a magnificent wheat crop , thirty bushels to the acre . He now rose even earlier and louder each morning , working until darkness covered his golden fields . Jada cooked sumptuous dinners for him , and she was reluctant to tell him that school would soon be starting . " Do n't worry your pretty little head about it one minute , " Uncle Mac exclaimed when she told him one morning at breakfast . He stretched his red plaid arms to reach his checkbook in a cupboard drawer .  | From what Jada could see across the table , the check would buy an exquisite marble headstone and two or three typewriters . " Aunt May and I can manage just fine , although we will miss you , Jada , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school . And next year more school . And more school . Do you know what I mean ? " " Thank you , Uncle Mac , " Jada said , accepting the check . " Thank you very much . And I think you mean college . " Uncle Mac nodded . Jada looked fondly at her uncle , so much like her own father . Loud and plaid . And good . " Uncle Mac , " she said , " do you know what I am going to buy  --  first thing ? " She tapped her fingers on the table in her excitement . Uncle Mac looked puzzled . " A dozen bottles of fingernail polish ? " " Oh , no . " Jada laughed . " A typewriter . I have been thinking maybe I could be  --  I would like to be ... " She paused . " A writer ? " Uncle Mac asked . Jada blushed . " Well , I can start by typing those poems you tell your Greek Beauties . If it is all right with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reached over and patted her hand . There was also a question Jada wanted to ask Uncle Mac , and she decided now was as good a time as any .  | " Uncle Mac , " she said hesitantly , " " usually I mind my own business , but ? " " Yes , Jada ? " Uncle Mac looked up from his cup of steaming Postum . " Uncle Mac " ? she slid her chair closer to the table ? " this may be none of my concern , but is Aunt May 's illness chronic ? I mean , is she bedridden during the winter months , too ? " Uncle Mac looked surprised , and set down his cup . " No . Usually just in the summer , " he said . " We go to Arizona every winter , as you know . She is fine there . It 's the climate , I suppose . " He cleared his throat loudly . " The climate or Aunt May ? " Jada looked directly at Uncle Mac . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  well . . . " She took a deep breath , selecting her words . " Uncle Mac , you work hard all the time  --  milking the cows , putting up hay , harvesting wheat , planting the garden ... " " And Aunt May does n't ? " Uncle Mac stirred his Postum slowly . " " Not that I have noticed . " " You are very perceptive , Jada . No one else ever noticed it . Or mentioned it , I should say . " " I think they did n't mention it , Uncle Mac . " Uncle Mac had stopped eating . " I know , Jada . It is difficult  --  impossible , I would say  --  to find someone who fulfills every expectation or dream that you  | have . The perfect companion for a lifetime . " He folded his hands on the table . " Perfect and forever are mighty big words , Jada . " " And perhaps that person may not even be living at the same time ? " Jada questioned . Uncle Mac looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Jada , with my limited knowledge . I sup-pose it is a possibility . But I do know that time does not alter some things in life  --  like , well , like the way you feel about a person . Years pass . It does n't matter . You still feel the same . I guess you young people call it love . " He smiled quickly . " And old ones , too . " " So , of course , you know about Aunt May 's condi-tion ? " Jada looked up hesitantly . Uncle Mac nodded and began stirring his Postum again . " I do n't call it a condition . I do n't call it any-thing . She has a heart murmur , the doctor says , and she needs to be careful . " He sighed . " Although not this careful . " He looked forlorn . " Aunt May wanted to marry a prince and live in a castle above a city . Instead she married a dry farmer . It is her way of coping , Jada . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched Uncle Mac 's arm . " Do you know you are good , Uncle Mac ? " she said . " I do n't know how else to be , " he sputtered loudly . " I know , " Jada said . " We are all good people here . "  | The geraniums on the windowsills had revived and were again in red bloom . The house was spotlessly clean , including the upstairs ballroom , where boxes , trunks , and antique furniture were arranged in an orderly manner around the room . Aunt May could have opened shop immediately had she been so inclined . As it was , she said , " I can not think of one more thing that needs doing , Jada , honey . Do whatever you like the rest of the day . " Jada went to her bedroom and sat on the bed , wondering herself what to do . She had made the bed this morning  --  with the corners of the magnificent rose bedspread brushing the floor . She decided to pack her suitcase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she noticed the green silk dress that she had worn to the Fourth of July Basket Dance . Her heart fluttered , remembering . She would return it to the trunk upstairs where she had found it that long-ago day in June . But first  --  she slipped the dress over her head and whirled in front of the oval mirror  --  she would dance in it one more time . She ran up the stairs . Closing the ballroom door behind her , she looked around , anxiously . Hoping . She walked over to the gramophone and turned the handle . The old record crooned its melody once again : I 'll remember you , You remember , too .. . Starr swept into the room in a rush of wind and sunlight , trailing leaves of balsam . He wore his brown army uniform , with his visor cap , as he had the first time he appeared . They stood , breathlessly , looking at each other . " Starr Freeman , " Jada whispered . " Jada Sinclair . You are wearing that charming dress again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what order out of chaos . " He sat down on the leather footstool under the windows , removed his cap , and hung it over one knee . Jada danced across the room , spinning lightly on  | her toes . She whirled into an old rocking chair next to Starr . " I wonder who listened to this song before us , " she whispered breathlessly . " It was your Grandfather William Sinclair and his lovely bride , Portia , " Starr answered . " A handsome couple . Except the gramophone was downstairs in the living room , along with this fine leather footstool . " " There is a radio-phonograph console down there now , " Jada said . " With cheese inside . " " Cheese ? " " Cheese , " Jada repeated . " And sometimes chocolates . For Aunt May . " Starr laughed . " I told you she was a good subject . " " Starr Freeman " ? Jada looked intently into his eyes ? " why have you come to me ? " Starr smiled tenderly and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melody , Jada , " he whispered , " as I was wandering . " He hummed softly the song playing continuously on the record . " And then " ? he hesitated ? " and then I saw you , dancing in that green dress with the white feather boa . . . " His voice faltered and he looked away . " But you knew my name , Starr . " Jada lifted her hands to touch his face . He stood abruptly , twirling his cap in his hands . " Sixteen years and I am still a novice , " he said . He moved to the window and leaned his arms against the frame . Looking far away .  | " Just know , " he said in a whisper , " that our paths crossed . " Jada sat motionless in the rocker . " And now , Starr ? " Starr turned from the window . " I can stay no longer , Jada . I just wanted to see you once more . For-give me , Jada . But do not forget me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never will I forget . But you will come again . You will ? " He shook his head sadly . Jada gripped the arms of the rocker and implored Starr : " You can work a miracle . We can go some-where far away and be together . Forever . I know you can work a miracle , Starr . " He looked away from her , not answering . " Somewhere far away , " Jada cried . " Somewhere , Starr . " Starr moved to Jada 's side and lifted her chin gently in his hand , looking into her eyes . " I will see you again someday , Jada . " " Do n't leave me here alone , " Jada whispered . " This is your home , Jada . You have another , perhaps a better home . And yes , there will be occasional reminders  --  if you are watchful . But this earth can be beautiful . It will be beautiful for you , Jada . " Starr dropped his arm . " And when it comes time to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I wanted to . " " I want to go with you , Starr , " Jada whispered . She held his arm .  | Starr shook his head gently . " Look at the trees . Sing your song . Write your stories . It is your world , Jada . " He moved again to the window . He put his hands to his face and whispered , " ' O , beauty , are you not enough ? Why am I crying after love ? ' " " You know my epitaph ? " Starr turned to Jada with longing in his eyes . " Re-member , Jada , I went to the same school . I read the same books . On the shelf  --  next to the Sara Teasdale book  --  is a book of poetry by Vachel Lindsay . Inside , probably still underlined , are these words : " And all I can bring is one more song , Though I 've brought you a thousand and one ... " " Thank you , Starr , " Jada whispered . " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And I will love you , Jada Sinclair . Forever . " Starr replaced his visor cap , adjusted it , and then , impulsively , held out his arms . While Jada was reaching for him , Starr Freeman disappeared . Jada walked slowly up the dusty road to the cemetery hill , unaware that she was still wearing the green silk dress , unaware of the marvelous green and gold world around her . She kneeled at Starr Freeman 's grave , encircling it with her arms , weeping . Faded rose petals pressed  | against her face , their fragile perfume still lingering . Gently she brushed the wilted flowers from his headstone . She moved her fingers over the gray granite as she read : HYRAM STARR FREEMAN UNITED STATES ARMY AIR CORPS JUNE 2 , 1925 ? FEBRUARY 10 , 1944 " ALL I CAN BRING IS ONE MORE SONG . " The granite was cold beneath her hands , the green mantle of his grave unyielding . Cold stone , hard earth . And Jada knew that Starr Freeman , beloved spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in the sky when Jada left the cemetery . She walked as in a dream down to the log cabin overrun with wild rosebushes . " All I can bring is one more song . All I can bring is . . . " Jada thought of her poems in the box under her bed . The stories still fluttering in her heart . Stories of loneliness and love . Of life and death . Stories of Aunt May and Uncle Mac . Of Daniel Bates and Patsy Wilson . Of Starr Freeman and Rosanne . And Jada Sinclair . " Thank you , Starr , " she said aloud . " I know now . I know now . " Holding yellow roses in her arms , she turned and walked slowly back down the road . Aunt May called when she heard Jada in the kitchen . " Jada , honey , you never stay in one place .  | Come in and visit awhile . " " I am on my way , " Jada called . " I gathered wild roses for you . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you are wearing my beautiful dress , " Aunt May said as Jada walked in . " It is still stunning . " Jada smiled and placed the roses on the nightstand , wishing they would never fade , never lose their petals . Yet knowing they would . " The flower of Aphrodite , " Aunt May said . " The flower of love . " She sighed faintly and leaned back on her pillows . Jada slid into Uncle Mac 's velvet chair , aware only of the bittersweet scent of the yellow roses and the softness of the silk dress over her bare knees . And from the west window , a magnificent sun , shimmering pink and gold across the brim of the cemetery hill . She glanced up as Aunt May reached for the roses on the nightstand . She plucked them from the vase and held them close to her . Drops of water scattered down her hot-pink negligee . " Aunt May , " Jada said , softly , " you should see the wild roses up near the cemetery hill . Masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all for you . " Aunt May smiled ruefully . " Well , how could I see them ? I would have to leave this bed . " " I could help you , Aunt May . We could walk slowly in the cool of the evening . And Uncle Mac could come , too . We could eat chocolates all the way ! " Aunt May flushed . " I do like wild roses . And  | chocolates . I will think about it , Jada . I will talk to Uncle Mac about it tonight . Thank you . " She looked affectionately at Jada . " Uncle Mac tells me you are going to buy a typewriter , Jada . How interesting . Are you going to write something ? " " Yes , Aunt May , " Jada said . " Something . I do n't know what , though . " " Well , make it romantic , Jada , honey , " she said . " Whether it is a story or an epitaph . " She flourished her arms , holding the roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ... " Jada smiled . " I will remember , Aunt May . I will re-member. "  | Robbins . She had other plans to keep herself alive for the entire summer : dreams to dream . Poetry to read . Words of her own to turn into verse . But after Izzy had left , Uncle Mac had called Jada 's mother , Hattie Sinclair , despairing , because Aunt May was dying in her big house with no companion to help her . No one , that is , except dear old Miss Millie , the only available domestic help in Billington . She came out on Saturdays and never spoke more than three sentences to Aunt May the entire day . And Aunt May needed sociality for her rheumatic condition almost as much as digitalis . Hattie Sinclair felt duly sympathetic and offered to drive across the valley to help Aunt May herself . But Uncle Mac said no woman should leave her own hearth and husband in June . Not in Ravensfield , where every man was busy cutting his own crop of alfalfa . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girls So Jada Sinclair was given the job . She was sixteen that summer of 1960 , and almost hidden from view in a curve of an apple tree when her mother told her the news . Her long tanned legs swung from a low branch of the tree , and through its thick green leaves her mass of dark curly hair looked very much like a magpie 's nest . " We are all good people here , " Jada 's mother explained beneath the tree . " And we help one another  | even if it is inconvenient . Also you will be paid . " It was called work . And to Jada 's parents , work was paramount . Right along with breathing . It had some-thing to do , Jada realized , with living through the Great Depression of the thirties . " Everyone is dying , " Jada exclaimed , closing the book she was reading and dropping it down to her mother . " Including me . " " Do n't worry about it , dear , " her mother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She picked up the slender volume from the grass : Poems of Sara Teas-dale . " It 's wonderful , really , Mother , " Jada said , jumping from the tree . " And I have the perfect epitaph for my headstone . " Her mother sighed . " Do n't enlighten me now , " she said . " Not with bread rising over the pan and overalls to be patched . " " Chiseled into Vermont marble , " Jada continued . " Pink Vermont marble , shipped all the way across the United States to Idaho . Does Vermont have pink marble , Mother ? " Hattie Sinclair paused to look at her long , leggy daughter with apple leaves tangled in her hair . " We will ask , " she said , " when the time draws closer . Now let 's get your suitcase packed . You will enjoy helping Aunt May for a while , I am certain . I will drive you over in the pickup after dinner . "  | In addition to her big house , Uncle Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had an up-stairs ballroom that had not been dusted for years . Dear old Miss Millie could no longer climb stairs , Aunt May explained from her white starched bed . And she knew she would feel much better if that big room were dusted . Reposing on her white pillows in a hot-pink negligee , fanning herself gently with a Redbook magazine , Aunt May looked more like a Story Princess on parade than a declining dry farmer 's wife . But if it would make Aunt May feel better , Jada was willing to dust the ballroom and , if necessary , the entire big house . The house was large and grand , a two-story , red-brick , imposing structure with a white-painted porch extending across the front . White decorative carvings trimmed the porch and the two dormer windows on the second floor . It looked proudly Victorian . Jada 's great-grandfather Sinclair had built the house many years ago on a corner acre of his newly acquired land in the newly settled valley of Ravens-field . Out in the middle of wonderful nowhere , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-five years . Vast stretches of green lawn surrounded the house and a long white picket fence encircled the lawn , with assorted flowers  --  sweet peas , nasturtiums , poppies  --  climbing up and pushing through the pickets .  | Behind the house on the north , a row of tall poplar trees had been planted for a windbreak . And wherever the eye looked , lilac and berry bushes grew profusely , without pattern . The most distinctive feature of the landscape , how-ever , was a large balm of Gilead tree in the middle of the front lawn , planted by Great-Grandfather Sinclair . For a little shade . It was now taller than the house , its great branches brushing against the dormer windows on the second floor and extending out onto the roof . After the death of Great-Grandfather Sinclair , the house and land had been kept in the family , first with Grandfather William Sinclair and now with Uncle Mac Sinclair . And because of their apparent good fortune , the neighboring dry farmers referred to the Sinclairs , behind their backs , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the rain , " Uncle Mac always said , waving his arms and his Stetson heavenward . Earlier in the week Jada had carried her suitcase up the nasturtium-lined path to the big house , wondering what would be expected of her here . Uncle Mac , an older version of her father , showed her to the large guest room on the main floor and said simply , " Aunt May is not well . She needs a little help . " As Jada unpacked her suitcase , she admired the room . Delicate pastel flowers trailed across the walls , the four-poster bed bloomed pink and red roses in quilted chintz , and the rug on the hardwood floor  | yielded flowers of every size and color . On the east wall stood a dresser with an oval mirror above , and on the north between two windows , a bureau . The windows were partially open , and the flowered lace curtains moved in the breeze . The windowsills held bright red geranium plants in clay pots . Delighted , Jada walked over to the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long expanse of lawn , reaching the tall poplar trees in the distance . Turning back , she noticed on the bureau two photographs in a silver double picture frame . One picture of a young woman and the other of a young man , both in military uniform . She recognized her cousin Rosanne , proudly posed in her WAC uniform in front of a great swirl of red , white , and blue bunting . Beautiful Rosanne with long , rippling , raven-black hair , just like Jane Russell in the movies , her Sinclair aunts always said . Jada could not see all the magnificent hair , however , because Rosanne 's WAC visor cap covered most of it . But she could see Rosanne 's angelic blue eyes and her cherry red lips smiling across at the young soldier . The smiling young man , Jada guessed , was the soldier Rosanne had planned to marry . Her aunts had talked , also , about handsome Starr Freeman , who had been shot down over the Pacific in a B ? 17 bomber and brought home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , and blue . His name was listed on a bronze monument in front of the City Hall in Billington , erected by the American Legion to honor war heroes from both world wars . When she was only a child , Jada had pointed it out to her mother . " On my birthday , " she said . And her mother answered , " Consider it a special blessing , Jada . He was a war hero . " World War II . A time that all the world wants to forget , her aunts said . After the war Cousin Rosanne had come home with a sailor named Hank . They were now living in Waco , Texas , with two children of their own , doing just fine without Starr Freeman as far as Jada knew . She looked for a long time into the silent smiling face of Starr Freeman before she left the room . Forget , forget , everyone said . But Jada knew that if Starr Freeman had ever smiled at Cousin Rosanne the way he was smiling from the photograph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs to Aunt May 's ball-room , feather duster in hand and vacuum in tow . Opening the door , she almost expected a ballroom scene with whirling dancers and a small orchestra in the corner . Instead , she saw a cluttered storage room with old trunks and furniture stacked at random . Only an echo  | of its former elegance reflected from the polished oak floor and the lace curtains drawn back at the windows . The thought occurred to her that Aunt May could open an antique shop and make a fortune . But Aunt May already had Uncle Mac making a fortune for her in alfalfa and wheat . She did not need an antique shop to make more . She simply wanted a well-dusted room . Jada twirled the feather duster over everything within reach . At her side she pulled along the tank vacuum , which hummed tonelessly as it swooped up the dust . As she worked , she peered into the old trunks jumbled with clothing and articles from days gone by . Beaded purses and feather boas . Odd-looking hats . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fingered old letters tied with faded ribbons . Eventually she worked her way to an old gramophone , a Victrola , standing upright in a corner near the door . Made of solid oak , it was a fine showpiece . Worthy of the window display in the antique shop  --  if Aunt May ever felt inclined . She rummaged around , looking for records to play , and found a stack in a cardboard box . All were broken . Disappointed , she continued to look , but she found no more . Still admiring the old gramophone , she lifted the 11 z 55
