When the weather is at its worst , the turkey hunting can often be at its best . Ten inches of fresh snow is any hunter 's dream , regardless of the game being hunted . The quarry is easier to see , you can read sign in the snow , follow tracks , and if the snow is powdery and dry , you can walk quietly . All of those factors made me a happy camper when I stepped out into the thick blanket of snow before dawn last April . Donned in white camo , I aimed my pickup down the forest road and , to my delight , discovered that no one had driven the road ahead of me . My headlights swept along the undisturbed forest lane , and for a little while only my tire tracks were etched in the pure white snow . Though it was almost May , late-spring snowstorms were n't unusual in the region . I was hunting turkeys in Wyoming 's Black Hills National Forest , a place I 've hunted for the last 15 years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd listened to five different turkeys gobbling from a single basin just a year earlier . My destination was still two miles away , when a huge snowdrift blocked the primitive road I was driving . The old logging road wound its way through some superb turkey country , so I decided to leave the vehicle where it was rather than bust through the drift . I had just carefully closed my truck door when a turkey gobbled from its roost tree close by . The bird 's timing was such that I think he heard the faint click as the door shut . It was still plenty dark , with shooting light more than a half-hour away , so I cautiously moved through the snowy woods to a place where I could work the bird . The forest was amazingly silent , and I felt sure that the snow had put a serious damper on gobbling activity . However , turkey populations were up in the Black Hills , even more so than the year before . Several mild winters in a row had boosted bird numbers dramatically . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quiet as church mice . As early light filtered into the woods , I waited a bit and tried a series of soft yelps on my cedar box call . Nothing . The gobbler was n't interested , and I wondered if perhaps he had me pegged . Perhaps he could even see my truck from his perch . Ten minutes later , a coyote yapped in the distance . The turkey responded immediately with a lusty gobble , and for the first time I pinpointed the bird 's location . He was about 150 yards away , high up in a big ponderosa pine . I tried more yelping , but he would n't answer . An owl hoot did n't work either . I did n't want to be too aggressive , because the bird no doubt saw my headlights and heard my truck when I drove in earlier that morning . Presently I heard hens yelping in his direction . The old boy obviously had mates with him , which complicated my plans . I had a unique ace in the hole , however . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow his tracks in the fresh snow when he left the roost tree . I heard the birds fly down a few minutes later , and the gobbler sounded off just after he hit the ground . That was the last time I heard him gobble that morning . More yelps from my call produced nothing . I waited 10 minutes and headed for the spot where I 'd heard him gobble . I was excited because I 'd be able to follow the flock . Tracking had to be the quintessence of turkey hunting . Surely , calling in a bird to a shotgun is the pure art of spring hunting , but tracking a bird and catching up and working within shotgun range is , for me , the supreme challenge . I 'd hunted turkeys in snow before but usually where drifts lingered here and there from the previous winter or where fresh snow quickly melted off by midmorning . This hunt was different . Every track in the woods would be steaming hot because it had snowed all night , and the snow was n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area I was hunting played an important role in deciding on this hunting technique . I would not recommend tracking turkeys if you 're hunting state land in Pennsylvania or New York , for example , but I knew that on this day I was the only hunter in the region . I eased along as carefully as I 'd ever done in a lifetime of hunting . All the years of stalking gray squirrels , whitetails , antelope and elk came into play . This was the big pursuit , the ultimate stalk . I felt like I 'd been training for this moment most of my life . Suddenly I saw movement , but it was too late . A hen glared at me 50 yards away . I froze , and she took off at a fast walk . She had n't completely figured out my identity , thanks to my snow camo , which covered me from head to ankles , including trousers , jacket , hat , face mask and gloves . Picking up their tracks , I followed until they slowed and resumed scratching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and again they ran off , but they still had n't flown . Apparently I represented cause for alarm , but not enough to thoroughly spook them . Four more times I bumped the birds . Each time they ran off , I dogged their tracks , and finally , after a pursuit that covered two miles from where it started , I saw a hen scratching in front of me . She had n't seen me , and I stood rooted to the spot as solidly as the big ponderosa pine standing a yard away . I waited for her to disappear , and then I moved in . It was a perfect setup . The birds were feeding on a slope below me and I was on a rise above them . If everything worked , I 'd be looking down their eyeballs when I eased over the top . My gun was shouldered as I took the last and final step . I slowly raised my head , concealing most of me behind the snowy bough of a pine tree , and I saw feeding birds 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I very carefully inched the muzzle toward his head . Slipping off the safety , I squeezed firmly on the trigger . The 12-gauge over/under roared , and my bird was flapping on the ground . I was mighty pleased with myself . This was my greatest moment in the turkey woods , even more so than when I 'd completed my turkey grand slam a couple of years ago . A few days after my 1991 hunt , John Higley , Outdoor Life 's California Editor , hunted the Black Hills with Ron Dube , who outfits in the area and guides turkey hunters . Higley and I took two birds each in the region in 1990 ( one each in Wyoming and South Dakota ) , but Higley did n't score in ' ' 91 . Four days of blizzards and wind worked against him . Higley heard a single turkey gobble between storms , but it would n't respond to his calls . Higley is a master caller and recently wrote a book on hunting Western turkeys . The previous year , when we killed two birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from much of the woods , and the temperature was warm and balmy , with little wind . Even if you tried , you could hardly get out of hearing of a gobbler . Higley made an interesting observation after his unsuccessful hunt in the snow . " There was no snow in the valleys just a few hundred feet below the forest , " he said , " yet the turkeys made no effort to leave the higher elevations ravaged by blizzard after blizzard . " Most spring turkey hunters in the United States wo n't need to deal with snow . A ripping blizzard fueled by bitterly cold gale-force winds , however , may indeed cause problems . One year , Ron Dube and I hunted the Black Hills in late April during a couple of beautiful spring days . A front moved in and with it one of the worst late-spring storms to hit the West in history . Dube and I opted to hunt when the storm was just getting going , despite serious weather warnings over the radio . It was one of the all-time dumbest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisories were correct ; the storm lasted four days and piled drifts 10 feet high , killing tens of thousands of livestock , as well as some people . Dube and I managed to get to his house by 2 a.m. but only after busting through three-foot snowdrifts on major highways that were closed ( unbeknown to us ) . It took 15 hours to get to his house ; normally it would take three hours . We had two encounters with turkeys during the blizzard . When we saw two gobblers walking quickly across an opening through deep snow , I piled out of our vehicle and stalked along their tracks . The birds ran far ahead of me to a cliff and took off , flying to the other side . An hour later , we spotted a flock of birds huddled under a huge leafless cottonwood tree in a draw . Dube made a stalk on the birds and killed a jake . Because of the swirling snow and roaring wind , Dube was able to approach within 20 yards of the unsuspecting birds . Famed turkey expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey hunting , does n't believe the presence of snow is a major factor adversely affecting turkey behavior . He cites many seasons in Missouri when hunters faced several inches of snow on the ground , but managed to score well on gobblers . Rain and wind , however , are universal weather factors that affect hunting everywhere . Eye believes that , without a doubt , a turkey hunter 's biggest enemy is the wind . " Ours is a sport that relies mostly on hearing and on being heard , " he says , " both of which become harder in any wind at all . But you can still call turkeys in the wind if you 're patient . " Try to find a place that 's out of the wind , like valleys and the windless side of hills , " Eye advised . John Higley agrees . " During windy weather , I 'll head for a canyon or basin that offers some protection , " he said . " I think turkeys get nervous like deer when the underbrush is moving with the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Alabama outdoor writer who is working on his fourth turkey book , says that hunters do n't wait long enough at the calling location on windy days . " Turkeys and hunters have trouble hearing each other in the wind , " Phillips explained . " It may take some time for the gobbler to come in , and many times the hunter does n't hear him at all . I suggest doubling the time you sit at your calling location . " " When it 's windy , " Eye advises , " take your time . Do n't travel very far between setups , and keep the wind at your back . Do n't forget your box call , and make your calls loud . Strain your ears into the wind but do n't get discouraged if you do n't hear a gobble . " Be careful of your reaction when you finally do hear a bird responding to your calls , " Eye continued . " Because a heavy wind can distort calls , you can never be certain of a tom 's exact location until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gobbler may have trouble pinpointing your calls . " John Phillips sees an advantage to hunting in the wind . " Because birds do n't detect movement and sounds very well when the wind is blowing , " he says , " you can get into closer calling position more readily when they 're in openings or along the edges of fields . " Rain is a big problem in turkey woods because , like wind , it cuts down on hearing for both the turkey and the hunter . Turkeys , however , will normally maintain their regular behavior patterns in a rainstorm . As Ray Eye put it , " Turkeys get to play their mating game only a few weeks of the year , and they 're not likely to let a little water get in their way . As I see it , neither will most good turkey hunters . " John Phillips has an interesting philosophy regarding rainstorms . " Birds on public land are hammered hard , " he explained . " Most hunters stay home on rainy days , relieving pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and that 's exactly why I like to hunt them then . " Phillips says that cedar box and slate calls usually do n't perform well when they 're wet . For that reason , he likes plexiglass/peg or mouth diaphragm calls . John Higley has a number of semi-wild birds in his backyard where he can observe them constantly . " I 've seen them huddle under a tree or brush during heavy rain , " he says . " They 'll preen themselves after the storm and are n't very responsive to calls until the hard rain quits . " Phillips makes a good point about rainstorms accompanied by thunder . " Turkeys will gobble almost every time there 's a clap of thunder , " he says , " which gives away the birds " location . Of course , lightning can pose a safety hazard to the hunter , so he or she must use good judgment about staying in the woods or heading for shelter . " Hunters who pass up foul-weather days are missing some excellent opportunities in the turkey woods . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to look at it from the perspective that turkeys have nowhere to go during nasty weather . They do n't hide in burrows or dens  --  they 're always out there in the woods . Dress accordingly and accept what nature dishes out , but do n't ignore serious snow advisories if you hunt in the North or West where spring blizzards are possible . Lightning storms are another hazard . Good judgment must prevail , despite your enthusiasm to bring home a gobbler . <p>
