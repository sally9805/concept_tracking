Section : School Wars American Education Under Siege <p> ' LET US first get clear , ' I said , that we are in the right place . This is Political Science 23 : Political Obligations . ' A young man in the back of the room raised his hand instantly and challenged me : What do you mean by that ? ' For the next seven minutes it was virtually hand-to-hand combat , and as far as I could see , nothing of substance had been placed yet on the table . The young man who asked the question never returned for the second day . But the word filtered back to me across the campus : someone had told this fellow that if he conceded even the very first thing I said , he would never be able to work his way out of the argument . <p> And that is perhaps why the air was crackling with anticipation even in the first moments of the class . The central problem of the course was the nexus between morality and law . The root of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind . The law displaces personal choice with a binding commitment , or a public obligation . The law may forbid us to discriminate on the basis of race in a private business , or it may restrain us from aborting children in the womb . In these instances , the law may commit people to things they find morally repugnant . To ask how that state of affairs can be justified is to raise again the question of whether there really are moral truths , or moral propositions in the strictest sense : propositions about the things that are universally right or wrong , just or unjust , for others as well as oneself . Only if there are propositions of that kind could we ever be justified in displacing , or overriding , personal choice in favor of a uniform , public rule . For in that event , we may be aske d , rightly , to forgo our personal preference out of a respect for things that are in principle right or wrong . Once we become aware , for example , that it is truly wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comically out of place to conclude that therefore we ought to give them tax incentives in order to induce them to stop . ' When we come to understand the things that are in principle wrong , it becomes radically inapt to assert our freedom of choice . ' <p> I used to tell the students , on the opening day , that we spend so much time in the colleges lingering with the things that are problematic and uncertain that it was worth taking at least one course to remind ourselves of those things in the domain of morality and law which we not only know but which can not be otherwise . The reception accorded to William Bennett 's Book of Virtues may show the persisting hunger in the public for some older understandings about the teaching of right and wrong , before nihilism and cultural relativism began to touch everything around us . But what I can report from the battle lines of the campus is that the news , for all students , is not exhilirating . <p> THE STUDENTS , of course , arrive at college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of mind , some of them seem positively depressed to discover that there really are moral truths , and they show no hesitation to blame the messenger for bearing the news . But a handful of others seem to discover a certain serenity in knowing  --  as one of my students put it years ago  --  that they may have access to a moral understanding that does not simply depend on the opinions of their friends . <p> The course on political obligations would pose the question again of how we could know , in morals , of certain apodictic or necessary truths , ' and we would put that question to ourselves through the classic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas . When the Founders said all men are created equal , ' did they really mean all men , ' black as well as white ? Did they truly articulate , as Lincoln said , an abstract moral truth , applicable to all men and all times ? Or did they mean , as Douglas argued , that only white men were equal to one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that judgments about right and wrong were always relative ' to the culture in which they were held ? <p> It was Lincoln 's understanding that the rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence had a natural ' foundation in the things that separated human beings from other animals . The right of human beings to be governed only with their own consent was a right that arose distinctly for beings who could give and understand reasons . And therefore those rights would remain the same in all places where human nature remained the same and men were still distinguishable from animals . Even in this age of animal rights , no one has suggested that horses or dolphins should share the vote ( except perhaps in Massachusetts ) . That is what the Founders meant when they referred to all men are created equal ' as a self-evident ' moral truth  --  not evident to every self who happened down the street , but self-evident in the sense of axiomatic or true per set nota , true in the nature of things . This understanding of the Founders was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening to the Federalis t #31 : In disquisitions of every kind , ' he wrote , there are certain primary truths , or first principles , upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend . These contain an internal evidence which , antecedent to all reflection or combination , command the assent of the mind . ' <p> It is persistently sobering for the students to discover that they are aligned with Douglas and not Lincoln . In that stance , they are joined by modern liberals , by most of their professors , and by the radical feminists . The Left on the campuses stand now as adversaries of Lincoln and the American Founders , for they deride the notion of moral truths or natural rights . ' Indeed , it has become the fashion now to deny that there is any such thing as human nature . ' As the argument runs , the doctrine of natural rights is merely an ideology ' to preserve patriarchy and the subordination of women . In this view , what we take to be human is socially constructed ' or constituted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local culture . And yet , the telling reflex among the feminists and the Left is to cast moral judgments , across the cultures , on regimes in other places . They think they can identify the rights and wrongs done to women even in the most exotic countries ; in fact , they even presu me that they can identify women ' in all places . And so , in the curious world of the campus Left , there are human rights ' to be vindicated in all places , but strictly speaking there are no humans . ' And since there are no moral truths , there are no rights ' that are truly rightful . <p> From the question of Lincoln and Douglas , we are drawn back to the grounds on which we may know of moral truths . We are drawn back , that is , to the teachings of Aristotle and Plato , to Kant and Thomas Reid . And from there the argument unfolds in a train of cases : judging regimes in other places ; wars and interventions ; the war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rescue ; the claims of privacy ' ' ; and then , finally , the course reaches its culmination in the problem of abortion . <p> But as the students come to understand almost instantly , the question of abortion is there from the first moments , when we are dealing with Lincoln and Douglas . They have heard  --  and they quickly come to grasp  --  that all of the implications that will be exploding upon them later really spring from the principles that were established earlier in the course . <p> But to avert the conclusions they find so deeply uncongenial , about abortion or Vietnam , they would have to strike at Lincoln . They would have to persuade themselves that there was no compelling ground for the rights that Lincoln was seeking to vindicate , and for the things that they , too , would wish to be true . And as they come to a judgment in this way about the ground of Lincoln 's argument , they must of course come to a decision about the grounds of their own judgments . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . I recall for them Kant 's remark : that when we offer our respect to any person , we really offer our reverence for that law of which he is an example . The mission , for the course , is to bring students to that condition in which they can finally give an account of the principled grounds of their judgments and motivations  --  the law of which they would purport to be examples . That is why this is the course in which students break down into tears . A course that seriously puts the question to them about the grounds of their own judgment cuts deeply . And that is why the professor must learn , over the years , to be disarming , and to soften some of the blows . <p> But the question must be put , demandingly , even if it induces discomfort . As Dr. Johnson wrote in his essay on John Milton , the knowledge of external nature , and the sciences . . . are not the great or frequent business of the human mind . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of right and wrong . . . . Prudence and justice are virtues and excellences of all times and of all places ; we are perpetually moralists , but we are geometricians only by chance . ' Not everyone may be up to the task , but no one can escape the need to make judgments about the ways of life that are better and worse . And so , to adapt a line from Woody Allen , there is no question that there is a moral world : The only question is , How far is it from midtown , and how late does it stay open ? <p> By HADLEY ARKES <p> <p> Mr. Arkes , an NR contributing editor , is the Edward Ney Professor of Jurisprudence at Amherst College .
