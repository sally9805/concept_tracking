Section : World report ; Cover story The democrats are in retreat , the economy is a shambles and the people are losing hope , but the West can do little to stop Russia 's slide <p> Dateline : Moscow <p> In a small village in the Ural Mountains , housewives queue up in the mud and snow to buy meat chopped from a large carcass and wrapped in brown paper . In Moscow , teenage girls consider prostitution a glamorous career opportunity . In the central Russian city of Penza , the local glass factory is too broke to pay workers , so they are handed vases and glasses to peddle off the hoods of their cars to find money to buy food . <p> Just a year after the hammer and sickle was pulled down from the Kremlin , time is running out for Russian President Boris Yeltsin 's experiment with democracy and market economics . The ruble has virtually collapsed , the economy is on the verge of hyperinflation and massive unemployment threatens the already dispirited work force . According to Russia 's Interior Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first nine months of this year than in the same period in 1991 , 60 percent more armed robberies and 51 percent more burglaries in homes ; and as the mostly unfettered media take crime public , the psychological impact is magnified . Government decrees often are ignored : With the abolition of the Communist Party , there is no Russian civil service to administer the country . Russia 's death rate now exceeds its birth rate , and the country 's population is actually shrinking . <p> In a survey for U.S. News by the Russian polling firm Vox Populi , 83 percent of those polled said they have less confidence in Yeltsin now than they did a year ago . From St. Petersburg to Vladivostok , opposition to Yeltsin 's reforms is swirling up from former Communist apparatchiks , disaffected military officers , xenophobic Russia-firsters and  --  most important  --  the industrialists and economic managers Yeltsin needs to get his crippled country moving again . <p> A tug of war between free marketeers such as Yeltsin 's acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and go-slower pragmatists such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance of industrialists , has left Russia with the worst of both worlds . The prices of staples such as sugar and milk have jumped 10-fold , but industrial production has fallen by 20 percent this year  --  more than any year of America 's Great Depression  --  and continues to drop , while unemployment , almost zero a year ago , could reach 4 million next year and 10 million by 1994 . The Central Bank reported last week that inflation is now running at an annual rate of 2,000 percent  --  and while higher prices have alleviated the most acute shortages , they have not improved dramatically the quantity , quality or distribution of food or anything else . <p> In energy , Russian oil is flagging  --  prompting Yeltsin last week to announce that the industry would be privatized ( story , Page 54 ) . In agriculture , Yeltsin 's opponents in parliament and the still-powerful collective farm lobby have stymied efforts of individual farmers to buy and sell land , or use it as collateral for loans to buy fertilizer , tractors and other necessities  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce 30 to 40 percent of Russia 's fruits and vegetables . Russia 's 104-million-ton grain harvest is up 14 percent in ' 92 , but an additional 20 million tons of imported grain are still needed . <p> Meantime , the powerful Russian mafia has used its hold on the lucrative food distribution business  --  including the hijacking of shipments  --  to drive prices even higher . A group of farmers who went to Moscow to sell meat were approached at the train station by three young toughs who offered to pay the asking price of 6,000 rubles ( $15 ) for the goods . The trio insisted , however , that the farmers bury the meat in the forest . The peasants complied but quickly realized that their customers had been sent by the mafia to buy meat from independent sellers in order to keep prices high . <p> Higher prices have not begun to fill Russian shelves with consumer goods , either . The Communists focused production of any given product at a few factories , and reformers have been unable to break up and privatize the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive unemployment . <p> Another problem is the defense industry 's stranglehold on Russia 's economy . More than a quarter of Russia 's industrial workers , 9 million in all , are employed in 1,500 military industries and 900 research and development enterprises . Although Russia 's weapons spending dropped 25 percent in 1991 , millions of workers are still being paid , either to sit on their hands or to produce weapons Russia does n't need and must now try to sell abroad to raise badly needed hard currency . Many plants are running on inertia , continuing to produce whether or not there is an order , ' says Andrew Aldrin of the Rand Corp . <p> Finally , the collapse of its currency , which the Communists for years artificially pegged at about $1.35 to the ruble but which is now trading at more than 400 rubles to the dollar , has robbed Russia of any ability to finance investments in new plants and equipment and imports of consumer goods and technology . Controlling the money supply , meanwhile , is all but impossible so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the poll for U.S. News , Russians overwhelmingly list high prices as their main concern , followed by low income , unemployment and other economic hardships . Compared with a similar poll in February , respondents worry less about shortages , indicating that consumers see more goods in the shops , even if they can not afford them . A joke reflects the irony : What have the new democrats been able to do in 12 months that the Bolsheviks failed to do in 75 years ? Answer : Make communism look attractive . <p> Acting Prime Minister Gaidar last week turned down demands from Civic Union and others for sweeping changes in government policies and personnel , saying there can be no return to central planning , no freeze on wages and prices , no relaxation of monetary policy and no major intervention to stem the ruble 's fall . The parliament , in turn , rejected Gaidar 's anticrisis ' program , setting the stage for a possible confrontation between the reformers and their opponents this week , when Russia 's Congress of People 's Deputies convenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections two years ago and still reflects the conservative views of the late Communist era . A year ago it granted Yeltsin broad emergency powers ; now it is lunging for his throat . Yeltsin 's special powers expire December 1 , and while some delegates want to block their renewal , others want to dump Yeltsin 's government entirely . One right-wing faction is demanding his impeachment . <p> The young , already alienated by communism 's failure , now feel even greater pressure as reformers stumble , too . Freed from communism 's suffocating cocoon , they think a lot about money . One Moscow housewife says little studying goes on : Pupils are obsessed with trading merchandise , new and secondhand . <p> Militiamen say young people are responsible for much of the rise in burglaries and theft . Before perestroika , there were some ideals , ' says officer Sergei Selivanov , an expert in juvenile delinquency . Now , these have been destroyed . People no longer know what to believe in . ' According to the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda , when asked about potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitution as highly attractive work , the newspaper reported . <p> Shallow roots . Such problems might be the price of building democracy . But critics argue that while communism has lost , democracy has not won . Yeltsin was freely elected , but Russia is one of the few nations east of the Elbe that have not held free parliamentary and local elections . Some major changes  --  more open government , the demise of the Communist Party , a freer press  --  reflect the lifting of repression more than the growth of deep democratic roots . <p> Indeed , the poll for U.S. News reveals that few Russians consider politics important anymore . One Western diplomat argues that the biggest mistake Yeltsin and the reformers made after last year 's failed coup was not using their popularity to hold free parliamentary elections and build real democratic institutions . Now , with the popular support that helped defeat the 1991 coup waning , it is too late . They blew it , ' says the diplomat . <p> Many Russians , in fact , are still uncertain what democracy means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have put a message on a wall at the entrance to town . It is written in the same red block letters as the old Communist propaganda , and it says : Democracy is civic responsibility , strict adherence to the law and self-control . ' Given such fuzzy definitions , it is no wonder that many people look at Russia 's economic condition and conclude that democracy is a failure . I would n't be upset if the democrats go , ' says Victor Malakhov , a superintendent at the Tameevsky collective farm near the central Russian town of Lunino . <p> A tendency to define democracy more as license than responsibility has created a climate more like the California gold fields in 1849 than Philadelphia in 1787 . This wild environment , coupled with Russia 's instability , fuels a get-rich-quick mentality . Sergei Rodionov , chairman of the Imperial Bank , says most financial activity  --  and fortunes  --  are made by betting on the fall of the ruble . Rodionov says speculators borrow millions of rubles from his bank at an interest rate of 120 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the ruble plunges some more . The speculators then buy enough cheaper rubles to pay off loans , plus interest , and pocket the difference . <p> Millionaires  --  real dollar millionaires  --  are made overnight , ' Rodionov says . Given the volatility of prices and the capricious tax laws , investors prefer playing ruble roulette to investing in the projects Russia desperately needs . Rodionov has issued credits for only two construction projects this year . One of those was in Kuwait , ' he adds . <p> Right-wing nationalists hope to harness disaffection with democracy by promoting conspiracy theories about Western schemes to impoverish Russia . There is a plot against the Russian nation , ' says Irina Shadrina , the foreign-policy strategist for the right-wing Russian National Assembly . But the real battle will come over demands by Civic Union for sweeping changes in Yeltsin 's government  --  in effect , creation of a coalition government . Anders Aslund , a Swedish economist who advises the Yeltsin team , says Civic Union may have overplayed its hand by demanding that a half-dozen top government officials resign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and fight , ' says Aslund . <p> That is what worries some of Yeltsin 's democratic critics , who fear he may yield to authoritarian impulses to restore order and silence opponents . Last month , when the right-wing National Salvation Front challenged him , Yeltsin banned it and prevented it from meeting . He also has hinted that he could dissolve the Congress and invoke presidential rule if the parliament gets too unruly . <p> As economic conditions continue to deteriorate in Russia and as Yeltsin moves to strengthen his hand , many in the West are beginning to reassess the role that the West and Japan could or should be playing in rebuilding Russia . This week , the major industrial democracies  --  the so-called Group of Seven  --  are likely to reschedule Russia 's $70 billion foreign debt , saving Moscow up to $10 billion dollars this year and next . <p> Other experts , though , argue that no amount of Western help can guarantee success . The Germans , for example , may spend $1.5 trillion over the next decade to absorb and rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same medicine to Russia would cost at least 10 times as much , or $1.5 trillion per year . The success or failure of Russian reform depends on the Russians ' own ability to get their act together , ' says a senior International Monetary Fund official . It 's a misconception that foreign aid and advice are the critical ingredients in the success of Russia 's reform effort . ' <p> False hopes . Many Russians , however , expected huge infusions of Western aid , credit and investment as a reward for renouncing communism . Now some are starting to feel betrayed , a sentiment Yeltsin 's nationalist opponents are only too happy to encourage . Meanwhile , Westerners who harbored the equally unrealistic hope that Russia 's democrats would rapidly build a Western democracy from the rubble of the Soviet system are losing patience with the reformers . <p> It now will fall to Bill Clinton to prevent the false hopes and misconceptions on both sides from derailing the fragile friendship between Yeltsin 's Russia and its former enemies in the West . Although there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to its neighbors and to the United States that the Soviet Union once did , Clinton may find himself forced to put Moscow much higher on his agenda than he had planned . <p> The Clinton administration will have to decide whether pressuring Yeltsin 's government for more-sweeping reforms will be productive or whether it would only fuel the anti-Western backlash . Clinton criticized Bush 's failure to stand up for the independence movements in the Baltics and Ukraine , but now he will have to temper his support for other former Soviet republics with concern for Russia 's own fragile democracy . Finally , the new president may have to prod Russia to sign a new strategic arms reduction treaty , resume troop withdrawals from the Baltics and restrain its sales of military and nuclear technology . <p> A growing chorus is calling on America and the West to do more to help Yeltsin and the embattled democrats and to safeguard the gains of the last few years in arms control and other fields . But helping Yeltsin 's new Russia may demand more ingenuity than combatting the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes TABLE <p> Picture : Fatigue .
