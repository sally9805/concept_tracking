The first thing I did when I saw Nicole " says Eddie Murphy of the breathtaking beauty at his side , " I turned to my accountant and said , " Her I would marry tomorrow  --  without a prenuptial . ' ' " For a second , the 31-year-old comedian falls silent . Then he breaks into his trademark grin . " That 's what I said , " he clarifies . " I 'll always have a prenuptial . " Well , it is n't exactly tomorrow  --  and Murphy presumably has his prenuptial , signed , sealed and ironclad  --  but this Thursday ( March 18 ) , five years after he first laid eyes on model Nicole Mitchell , the moment of commitment will come . Vans filled with lilacs , tulips , gardenias and orchids are scheduled to arrive at Manhattan 's Plaza Hotel by early evening . ( Other vans have been reserved to deliver the flowers to a hospital in Harlem after the reception . ) The low-cut off-the-shoulder white wedding gown and the coral bridesmaids ' dresses have been fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterers are ready , and security is light . When , at 6:30 p.m. , Murphy stands in the Plaza before Rev. Calvin Butts of Harlem 's Abyssinian Baptist Church , 500 guests , including Prince , Arsenio Hall , Bruce Willis , Demi Moore , Queen Latifah , Sugar Ray Leonard , Bill Murray and Wayne Newton , will have assembled . And all that will stand between Eddie " Party All the Time " Murphy and his blessed bachelorhood are two little words : not " Who me ? " but " I do . " So , Eddie , are you ready ? Best intentions notwithstanding , there is reason to wonder . This is , after all , the same rough-edged comic who strode onstage in the 1987 concert film Raw and proclaimed that the only woman he would trust would be one he found sitting " buck naked on a zebra in Africa . " It is the same Eddie Murphy who paraded across the tabloids with scores of beautiful women on his arm  --  not just before he began dating Mitchell , but even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . And it is the same Eddie Murphy who was still hemming and hawing about matrimony four months after he proposed . " If me and Nicole gel married , we 'll just run off and do it , " he said last April . " If we do it . " But could n't Murphy , who is obviously a doting father , make the transition from playboy to family man ? In many ways , he already has . Kicked back on a mauve lounge chair in Bubble ( slang for party ) Hill , his $3.5 million , 22-room colonial estate in suburban New Jersey , the superstar is still surrounded by such requisite party-boy trappings as an indoor racquetball court , bowling alley and swimming pool . And yet the scene is quite different from that of four years ago , when the actor last invited PEOPLE into his home . The wooden floors , then spit-and-polish clean , are now smudged with little footprints , and the blaring jukebox has been muted . But the most remarkable change is in Eddie himself . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cop I and II . Trading Places , The Golden Child , 48 Hrs. , Coming to America  --  attracted such crowds that he earned the nickname Money . Recently , though , his fabled star power has lost some of its wattage . Last summer 's Boomerang was n't the breakout hit that Paramount had been hoping for , and The Distinguished Gentleman , his Christmas movie for Disney , fell even flatter . Though he has just released a new album , Love 's Alright , work on Beverly Hills Cop is stalled because the film is mired in production problems . Yet for the moment , the man to whom career was once all important seems most interested in wooing the three-person audience in his living room . These days , their 4-month-old son , Myles , can be found sleeping quietly in Nicole 's arms while Bria heads to the jukebox to push Curtis Lee 's " Pretty Little Angel Eyes "  --  the only button she can reach . And Eddie ? Well , Eddie virtually clucks with pride . " I 'm the disciplinarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With Nicole it 's , " Oh , come on . Bria , please have something to eat . ' I do n't negotiate with her . It 's yes or no . Once she turns 18 , she can do what she wants to . For now , I 'm the parent , and she 's the child . " No question . Eddie seems ready for the family life  --  less a bad boy in temporary check than a devoted partner for whom wedding vows will be a mere formality . Still . it 's a formality that his mother , Lillian Lynch , will be delighted to see him go through . " He keeps us happy , and my biggest effort is to make him happy , " says Lynch , " but I think he should settle down . Nicole is a great woman . " Neither Murphy 's mother nor his fiancee needs a psychologist to tell them that , for Eddie , " settling down " will not come easily . His vituperative outburst against women in Raw was not , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and disliked  --  women at that point in his life . The reason ? According to Murphy , it was former fiancee Lisa Figueroa . In 1984 , she was a biology student at Adelphi University on New York 's Long Island ; he was just a couple of years out of Saturday Night Live and a fast-rising star . Rightly or wrongly , Murphy became convinced  --  some say with the help of his friends  --  that the woman he loved was more interested in spending his money on jewelry and furs than in Eddie himself . Later , Murphy angrily called off the engagement and proceeded to get in his last verbal licks before the whole world . Figueroa , who could not be reached by PEOPLE for comment , has never spoken publicly about the split . " It was a bitter time , " Murphy once said of those Raw days . " I was hostile . " When Eddie first spotted Mitchell at the 1988 NAACP Image Awards dinner in Los Angeles , he was still in a romantic slump , feeling dejected and sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His take on life was simple : " Everything 's a drag . " But a beautiful woman was a welcome distraction . And Nicole Mitchell , the daughter of a white British homemaker and a black U.S. Air Force pilot , was stunning . Murphy sent a friend to her table to ask for an introduction . Though flattered by the attention , Mitchell , a successful print and runway model , was far from giddy when she first met the superstar . " We got to know each other slowly , " she says . Very slowly . At first , Nicole was just another pretty face to Eddie , who continued to pop up in the tabloids with a string of beautiful dates . But far from the public eye , says Eddie , he and his future bride were making progress . " It was n't a Harlequin romance , sitting around the fireplace and sipping champagne , " he says . " It started that way , but it turned into something real . " To Murphy 's delight , Mitchell did n't seem interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging furs on his credit cards . She , after all , had been modeling since age 10 , riding in limousines and flying first-class to picture shoots from her family 's home in Sacramento . " She had already adjusted to the fuss , " says a longtime family friend , painter Kathryn Garcia Smith . " She helped him to grow more comfortable with himself and with his fame too . " The courtship was very un-Murphy-like . The couple cuddled while watching old Elvis Presley movies and tapes of Amos and Andy shows on TV . " She was the first woman I had met on that whole romantic level , " says Murphy , struggling to put his feelings into words . " Most of the girls I 've gone out with are really nice girls . Nicole is a woman . You can talk to her . She 's honest . She 's straightforward . She 's got a sense of humor . And , " he adds , laughing that Eddie Murphy laugh , " on top of that , she 's fiiine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daughter . Bria was her first child , but Eddie , though never married , had others . He reportedly fathered a daughter , Ashlee , by ex-girlfriend Nicolle Rader in 1987 and a son , named Eddie Murphy Jr. , by Paulette McNeeley in 1989 . For years , Murphy denied reports that the children were his . ( Rader filed a paternity suit in 1987 . ) But recently his response has changed . " I am not denying the existence of other children. , he says now . " I have always and will continue to live up to my obligations . " Murphy 's reaction to Nicole 's initial pregnancy was upbeat from the start : he not only acknowledged his responsibility , he celebrated it . " I got a kid coming , and I 'll have my first Christmas with my baby in December , " he proudly told Pierce O'Donnell , coauthor of Fatal Subtraction . ( O'Donnell 's book with a successful suit against Paramount Pictures by columnist Art Buchwald , who claimed that he had originated the idea for the Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were then uncharacteristic paternal stirrings : " I wanted to have a kid with Nicole because I was in love with her . " Love is one thing ; commitment another . For the first year of Bria 's life , Murphy was scared and confused , he says , and kept his distance . His lover and child luxuriated in a $1 million lakefront mansion he bought for them in Sacramento . Murphy flew in from New Jersey sporadically , more like an amiable uncle than a devoted dad . " I associated the whole family thing with being a middle-aged person , " Murphy said . " I was holding on to my youth . I could feel it pulling in me , but I was like . " I 'm still Ed . Still single . I 'm a bachelor . " To his mother . Eddie 's antics came as little surprise . " He 's very , very tricky , " says Lillian . " It could n't have been easy to court Eddie . " But if anyone could ride out Murphy 's moods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a child ( though they later reunited ) , and Nicole and her three brothers , Trevor , now 41 , Nathan , 28 , and Darius , 19 , were raised by their mother , Ellen . " Her mom never made single parenting look tough . " says family friend Garcia Smith . " Nicole learned by example . " While her nervous boyfriend clung to his bachelorhood , Mitchell , financially comfortable with her own $100,000-a-year income in addition to Murphy 's support , went serenely on with her life in Sacramento  --  exercise classes five times a week , bowling with friends , shopping with Bria . She did not pressure Eddie . " Nicole sits on the side and observes , " says Garcia Smith . " Her strength is her reserve . " By Bria 's second birthday , Murphy had begun shifting gears . " After a while , going to a disco all the time ai n't that much fun , " says Murphy . " Sitting in a room and shaking people 's hands all night  --  it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilling , he discovered , were the daily duties of daddyhood  --  like answering Bria 's endless questions about her favorite singer , Michael Jackson . " To her , I 'm just Daddy , " says Murphy . " He 's a star . " For once in his life , he says , second billing was n't so hard to take . " Fatherhood , " he says , " made me a much more serious person . " Murphy was in just that frame of mind when , on Christmas Eve 1991 , he peeked out from his Bubble Hill bathroom at Nicole , stretched out on the bed . " Bria was n't feeling well , " recalls Nicole , " and I was talking to Eddie about her fever . He came out and laid on the bed , and all of a sudden he grabbed my hand . I thought he was looking at my nails , " she says , laughing . " But then he slipped this big rock on my finger and said , " Let 's get married . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jokes Eddie , smiling tenderly at his fiancee : " I had to do the right thing . " Now the Reverend Butts is set to make Eddie 's honorable impulse official . At their homes in New Jersey , Murphy 's brothers , CB4 star Charlie Murphy , 34 , and actor Vernon Lynch Jr. , 25 , and his cousin Ray Murphy Jr. , 34 , are practicing their groomsmen 's toasts . His stepfather and best man , Vernon Lynch , is polishing his best shoes . And Bria , as head flower girl , is working on her most ladylike walk . But most excited is Murphy 's mother , Lilian . " Marriage is a lot of give and take , and they 're going to have to work harder than most people , " she says , injecting a note of realism before a statement of faith . " But they 're going to be good for each other . " <p>
