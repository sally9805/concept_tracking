" Brixtow White Lady " is Felicity 's first fiction sale , and marks her first appearance in print . Since we bought this story , she has sold us several more . She has also sold short fiction to Tomorrow Magazine . On the last day of her freshman year of college , Roc books purchased her first two novels . <p> <p> BY THE TIME I GOT OFF THE train in Naivasha , I knew that no matter how far I traveled , I could not escape my crime . The squinting yellow houses of Nairobi ; the straining , puffing climb up the Kikuyu escarpment ; the moment when I looked down into the vast floor of the valley for the first time , and felt my mind stretch , creaking like an overblown balloon . The long journey from Cobh in Ireland , three months of paranoia carrying over from 1923 to ' 24 , lay behind me . No apologetic , lounge-suited fellow had entered my compartment and said , " Excuse me , Lord Dunmanway . I 'm from Scotland Yard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The train shuddered to a halt ; clouds of steam billowed up outside the window . On the platform , two European men shook hands and slapped each other on the back , delighted to meet again . Friends . How Charles would have relished this moment of arrival ! A stab of crippling guilt bit into me , so that I had to hold onto the overhead rail and wait for it to pass . <p> If I had been hanged , the guilt would no longer plague me . <p> But I do not believe I deserve to die for killing Charles . We were friends for eleven years , bachelors living in a backwater , perfectly suited . Or so I thought . One autumn afternoon as we walked with our dogs in Mallow woods , he confronted me with my secret . We quarreled , I incoherent with fear , he growing furious , until he backed me up against the harebell bank . He pinned my arms with one hand and reached inside my jacket , inside my shirt . His face went red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Will you deny it now ? " <p> " Please , " I begged . " Do n't tell anyone ! " <p> " Why should n't I ? " <p> " Anything  --  I 'll do anything , if we can go on the same as before  --  " <p> A look I 've seen all too often on other men , aimed at some comely young girl , came over his face . " Perhaps there is something . " He pressed against me , a heavy physical presence . " I think I could be persuaded not to tell . You make a pretty woman , you know . Perhaps we can be even better friends than before . . . " <p> I am not responsible for what happened next . The magic flooded my body . I 'd believed it gone : it had n't stirred since I was thirteen . But now it bloomed and filled me with supernatural strength . I leapt on him , screaming with panic . Thumbs anchored in his nostrils , fingers in his ears , I dragged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic made his flesh like wet clay under my hands . It did not ebb until he lay moving feebly on the crushed harebells , hog-nosed , split-mouthed , blobby trotters coming out of the wrists of his jacket , ears bleeding from the pressure of the changes inside his skull . <p> I drew back , my joints watery . Unable to bear the bubbling moans that came from his windpipe , I pulled out my pistol and shot him in the head . <p> Our dogs ripped the remains apart and spread them through the woods . <p> At the inquest , I testified that I had seen his own hounds turn on him . The dogs were shot . There was no case against me . <p> But on my return to Dunmanway House , I found my servants fallen away , the whole country rife with suspicion . Hag-ridden , I could neither sleep nor eat . I knew it was folly to stay in Ireland . I wired anyone and everyone who had ever known me or my father . A distant cousin here , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant of those who replied . Perhaps a new start would help me expunge my guilt . <p> I manhandled my trunk off the train , wrinkling my nose against the smoke and steam . Scantily clad boys clustered around me , touting their services in pidgin English . <p> " I do n't want a porter . Go away , children . " I hefted the trunk in my arms . " This is all the baggage I have . " <p> " Go away , go on , this man is with me . " A tall , rugged-featured Somali advanced into their midst , scattering them like guinea fowl . Behind him , a European woman gazed vaguely around the platform . Her face was painted as white as a china doll 's . She wore a straight , low-waisted dress with a cardigan ; a crocodile clasp bag swung from one hand . Extremely unattractive . But then I find women as a species distasteful . It is not their faults , poor things . Society reduces them to their figures and their faces , weighting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be one . <p> " Excuse me . Are you here for Robert Bray ? " I asked her . I had never met my cousin , or his wife Thalia . <p> The woman fixed me with faded blue eyes , the pupils pinpoints . " I 'm Chantal Voormilt . Are you Lord Dunmanway ? " The clasp bag swung rapidly . " Robby is n't here to pick you up because everyone 's asleep . We were all horrified when Thalia remembered you were coming this morning . It was a tremendous nuisance . The Robertsons left , after all our efforts to make them stay another week , and the Buckleys went too , because Jennie refused to stay if I was going to be the only other woman . Personally , I enjoy having the odds in my favor . " She made eyes at me , and continued : " Then Thalia was relieved you were coming , to fill out the dinner table , you know . We were wondering if we would have to drive all the way to the Wanjohi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up . " <p> She obviously did not think she had been rude . I tried to extract the facts from her tirade : " Why . . . ah . . . did Jennie leave ? I did n't quite  --  " <p> " Oh , she came out with it in front of Thalia . I sha n't play second fiddle to you any longer , she said . Tom and I are going to the Robertsons ' house . Did you ever hear such appalling rudeness ? " <p> " What did Thalia think of it ? " <p> " Say what you will of her , the dear girl is a saint . But actually . . . " Chantal sniggered , a surprisingly boorish sound coming out of that red doll-mouth . " We were at tea . She threw her bread at Jennie 's face and called her a Whore of Babylon . Jennie said the pot was calling the kettle black . " <p> My sweet Thalia , Robert had written , looks forward to your visit as if she were a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peerless hostess , she is unhappy unless all her guests are settled comfortably . . . I remembered how his writing had wavered across the page . <p> I shifted the trunk onto one hip and wiped my brow . The train had been hot , but the platform , thick with clouds of steam from the locomotive , was worse . <p> " What is your Christian name ? " <p> " Francis . " <p> " You poor man , Francis , I 'm keeping you standing like a native . How callous of me ! " Chantal lashed her bag through the air , narrowly missing the Somali . He took the trunk from my arms and passed it to his personal Kikuyu boy . Chantal led the way out into a cloud of peppery red dust , where cars , drivers , cattle , and urchins wandered . She climbed behind the wheel of a black Buick . " I always drive . Tch-tch . Do n't offer . But Abdullah will ride in the back if you want , so you can sit beside me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine was surprisingly lenient ; the wind rippled through my hair ; red dust rolled along the road behind us in sausage-like puffs . Clouds raced above a horizon sharp enough to cut the eye . " What marvelous light ! " I shouted , needing to express my unexpected lightheartedness to someone . <p> " Oh , yes . You should see it when the sun sinks . The air is like honey . Or if you 're on safari , and you get up early , and go down to the river to wash your face . . . " Here she appeared to lose the thread of her sentence . She frowned , wrinkling her porcelain brow , and took one hand off the wheel to massage the opposite forearm . " One P.M. , that 's early . We usually have pink gins when we get up , and save the whiskies for later . Thalia does a fantastic whiskey sour . Limes and God knows what else she puts in it . What 's your poison , Lord Dunmanway ? " <p> Perhaps the altitude was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulant . The Aberdare hills were very much like the mountains of Kerry : above the road , the same breathtaking rock formations rose out of the same steep spurs covered with forest . Silver lines arrowed down the escarpment . The clear light transformed the landscape , so that I almost convinced myself the peaks were huddled giants who had slumbered so long trees had grown up over them . Now and again the odor of wood-smoke blew past my nostrils . <p> But there was no sign of human habitation . " Most of the farming is done in the valley , around Gilgil , " said Chantal . " If you live up here , it 's a sign that really you ca n't be bothered with the petty things of life . " <p> The Buick wound higher and higher along a road with a sheer drop on one side . With every foot we climbed , my spirits rose higher . <p> " It 's horrendous in the rain , " said Chantal . <p> We arrived at Brixtow at four . A modest thatched mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountain whose walls towered sixty feet and kept out the sun . Chantal brought the Buick to a halt , spraying gravel . I sniffed the air . The scent of mimosa was dizzying . But underneath it , surely that was a lady 's perfume ? <p> " She could have waited for us . I did want a cocktail , " Chantal said , and hurried inside . <p> I looked around for Robert . <p> Half a dozen Kikuyus leaned in the various doorways , silent as black marble columns . <p> Seeing my bemusement , Abdullah got out , stretched his long body , and said : " You may wish to go inside , Lord Dunmanway . Mrs. Bray 's room . You will be able to tell which it is . " <p> The lobby was furnished with sofas loose-covered in chintz . Cut-glass trays stood on every available surface , overflowing with cigarette butts . In places the carpet was stained . I passed onto a veranda . The mansion was C-shaped , partially enclosing a courtyard with a fountain : on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the back of the cleft . I tiptoed along the veranda , catching whiffs of tobacco smoke , wine , and vomit . At last I smelt Chantal , and heard male laughter from behind a door . I lifted aside the screen . <p> " Lord Dunmanway ! Francis ! Come in . " A broad-shouldered fellow with small features and fair hair grasped my shoulder , pulling me into the room . A bathroom . Chantal Voormilt and half a dozen men slumped against the silver fixtures , cocktails in hand , apparently recovering from some hilarious joke . A tub edged with silver and black tiles was sunken into the middle of the floor . Beside it knelt a Somali girl in a red and yellow dress , pouring hot water from a ewer . Thalia  --  it could be no other  --  lay with her pale breasts rising from the oiled surface , a gin fizz in one hand , caressing the fox-terrier that sat on the tiles beside her head . <p> How could I have known that the most striking individual I have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> It does not do her justice to say that she had coils of teak-colored hair , piled above a smooth white forehead ; eyes as blue as sapphires dredged up from Lake Victoria ; dark crescent moons for brows ; a nose as small and neat as any Botticelli Madonna 's . But how can one describe beauty except through the minutiae ? <p> I gulped for air , staggered , and sat down on a folding chair that the fair man pushed under me . <p> " Cousin Robert ? " I said weakly . <p> " That 's me . " Robert knocked his cigarette on Chantal 's sleeve to get her attention . " Chanty , have you heard the latest one that 's going the rounds in Nairobi ? It 's about me and Longly . <p> There was a young girl of the Mau <p> Who said she did n't know how . <p> She went for a cycle with Robby and Michael <p> She knows all there is to know now . <p> Is n't that beyond the pale ? Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thalia looked my way . Meeting her gaze felt like baring oneself to a waterfall  --  the pounding is bracing , but one knows that before long it will break one down . Her beauty was not only in her features , but in her gracefulness , and the naked appraisal of her gaze . " Are you planning to stay for supper , my lord ? Shall I tell the servants to lay another place ? Or have you only stopped for a minute ? " <p> " Point well taken , madam . " I shrugged out of my coat and hat . " I was planning to stay for several suppers . I have n't long-range plans yet . " <p> " We 'll have to see how amusing you can be before we agree to that . None of us at Brixtow wants a bore here . Conviviality is one of the things I demand my guests have . I 'm very good at panning house parties . " <p> " I 'm sure , madam . " <p> " I hate men who condescend ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bore , I 'm afraid I ca n't discuss art , do n't know anything about the classics , ca n't fly a plane , ca n't sing , only play the piano , and that not well . Does that disqualify me ? " <p> " Oh dear , I do n't think you will fit in here . Whenever we 're not giving each other lessons in Greek and Italian , or talking about our collections of priceless art , we careen around the Aberdares in fighter planes left over from the War . " <p> Her eyes sparkled . I twitched a smile off my face . I did not want to get along with her . <p> " Well , he has to have a certain absolute value , " a stout , red-mustached man said . " Warm body , and all that . " <p> There was a ripple of laughter . I glanced at Robby . He had sunk to the floor beside me , legs crossed awkwardly at the ankles . His tongue protruded from one comer of his mouth ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm . I looked up . No one seemed to have noticed . If they had , they did n't find it anything out of the ordinary . <p> " Thallie , " Chantal said , " you 're a shocking hostess . Your cousin has n't got anything to drink . " <p> Thalia giggled . " I 'm in the bath . " <p> " What difference ought that to make ? " <p> " You know , Chantal , you 're quite right . Margot ! " Thalia snapped her fingers . The maid came forward , silent and neat-footed between the spills of scented water , and extended a giant Turkish towel . Thalia stood up in the bath , exposing herself down to a triangle of dripping , nutmeg-colored pubic hair . " Get my dress ready . The pink with the silver panniers . Everyone out . Shoo  --  shoo ! Go on ! You too , Chantal . " <p> The guests filed out of the bathroom . Red-mustache shut the door behind them . Panic squeezed my gut : I felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I killed Charles it had made itself felt may times : in a situation like this , I was afraid it would break loose again . Thalia , wrapping a towel about herself African style , squatted beside a marble chest in the comer and mixed me a cocktail . " Here , Lord Dunmanway , is a Brixtow Special White Lady . Savor it . " <p> As she was putting away the bottle , she caught my nervous gaze . One corner of the exquisite mouth tugged upward . <p> " You leave me speechless , madam , " I said . <p> " I ca n't get over the way you talk ! Fairshante  --  that 's the fellow who said you were a warm body , I 'm not quite sure whether it was a compliment or not  --  " she laughed loudly  --  " he 's Earl of Gloucestershire , so he ought to sound plummy as anything . But his accent is n't as delicious as yours . Something happened to it since he left Eton . " <p> " Sorry to disappoint you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head tilted in disbelief . " No , I swear it . I grew up alone with my father , on our estate in Southern Ireland . " <p> " Well ! I grew up in a little village , and escaped to London as soon as possible . You 're very reserved . I suppose that comes of not going to Eton . All the boys play with the other little boys , you know , and it creates such an unhealthy atmosphere when it comes to punishment . " <p> She sounded perfectly innocent . But what if the Brays had already judged me by reading the accounts of the Mallow murder case in the papers ? The prospect was too awful to contemplate . I forced my voice to its usual tenor . " How much news do you hear from Home ? " <p> " Not much . " She made a moue . " Not much at all . And it tends not to be very interesting . I use the papers for the bottom of my parakeets ' cages . " <p> She passed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet birds . I slumped against the wall , loosened my collar , ran my fingers around my hairline to catch the trickles of sweat . <p> IN MY HEAD , that evening tinkles against my other memories like a glass bauble . The paneled British-style dining room rang with laughter . We were all half drunk before we started eating . Thalia most of all . Because of that , or in spite of it , I found the jokes unusually witty . As a rule I avoid alcohol . Chantal and Sam Voormilt had unforeseen artistic talents . They climbed on the table and did a song and dance routine to the tinny phonograph . <p> The servers glided in and out with dishes done to a turn . Robby sat out , eating nothing , occasionally volunteering a rude limerick . He was a very heavy morphine user . It can not have been good for his health . <p> Williams  --  an American who was visiting from Boston on the strength of having known Robby ten years ago  --  seemed the most sensible of the lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in paradise , you know . " <p> " Who , Robby ? " <p> " That 's my theory . We 're only really happy in our dreams , see , and morphine makes the whole world into a living dream . " <p> " Do you use it ? " <p> He cut a neat slice of marlin . He garnished it with butter , salt and pepper , then put it into his mouth . " There are limits . Even in Kenya . " <p> Watching him chew the fish , round head nodding at each bite , I wanted to gag . I excused myself . Chantal was already outside . We retched into the fountain . " That 's what it 's there for , " she said between spasms . <p> " I should hate to be the servant who has to clean it out . " <p> " That 's what they 're there for . " <p> " What are we here for ? " I asked , trying to be friendly . I 'd winced for her many times during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Chantal as a bad example . <p> " What a deep question . " She sat on the rim of the fountain , head silhouetted against the stars at the top of the cleft . The cries of hoopoes and nightjars blended like music , ten , a hundred times more immediate than the wailing of the phonograph from inside the screens . Because I am female , I can not restrain these poetic fancies : they were one of the clues that led Charles to guess the truth . <p> " I 've thought about it a lot . And I conclude that we have no other purpose on this earth than to provide excitement in Thalia 's life . " The shingled head bobbed emphatically . <p> " All of us ! " <p> " She deserves adulation . Anyone who looks like her must . But her women guests usually ca n't understand that  --  they waste their time envying her . Whereas the men wait around forever , hoping they will be chosen for the battleground . That 's what we call her bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh  --  " a mulish toss of the head "  --  we just come for the dinners . " <p> I knew better in Sam 's case , of course , and I believed I knew better about Chantal too . <p> " Do you know why she did n't send you packing this afternoon , when you acted so dim ? " <p> " Because I 've come all the way from Ireland for a visit ? " <p> " Silly ! Because she chose you the minute you walked in the door . " <p> My breath caught in my throat . I had forgotten how terrifying the threat of intimate contact was . How the heat stopped , the blood congealed , and prickles ran over the skin under the dinner jacket . I had n't been so frightened since Charles ' attempt at sexual blackmail . <p> I went inside and had another drink , and another , and another . <p> " Now , I 'm closing my eyes . And when I open them . . . . " <p> Thalia 's hands shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room keys in pairs . We waited breathlessly , crowded into her bedroom , clutching our whiskies . " Do you suppose this is how God decides things when there 's a war ? " said the red-mustached Fairshante . " Odd man out , off to the battleground with you ! " He broke out in heavy laughter . <p> The dark embroidery-silk lashes lifted the tiniest fraction . Thalia placed the last pair of keys . Then she opened her eyes , licked her shining lips , and read out the tags . <p> " Thalia Bray and Francis Dunmanway . " <p> Well , I had been warned . But that did n't prevent my pulse from racing . Someone slapped me on the back and said I 'd been the odds-on favorite . <p> " Chantal Voormilt and Williams . I 've never got round to asking whether you have another name , Willy ? " <p> " Nosir I have n't ! " Williams jiggled like a blancmange inside his suit . Clearly he had never been chosen to play the game before . He flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we . . . ? " as if he were asking her to dance . <p> " What about Sam ? " I said . <p> Chantal advanced with a determined , lurching stride . " Sam does n't mind . Why should he mind ? He 'll just stay there until daylight , happy as a sandflea , while you and I , Willy Willy , keep ourselves warm . " <p> We roared with laughter . I do n't know why . Perhaps because Sam had passed out in the comer of the dining room with one shoe off and one shoe on . <p> " Diddle diddle dumpling , my son John , " Thalia said pensively . Then she shook herself . " Have n't you kissed her yet , Williams ? Come on , play the game ! That 's better . What 's the number on your key ? Four ? That 's on the other side of the courtyard . . . " Her voice faded as she passed out of the veranda door , herding Williams and Chantal ahead of her , trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them grinned at me and made an obscene comment as he shut the door . <p> I took a deep breath . I was alone with twelve sleeping parakeets in a lady 's bedroom . <p> Charles ' voice came to me : " Women are like dogs , Francie . Can you know what your hound is thinking ? You can not . And a lovely little Pekingese , for example , or a prize spaniel , has even less in its head than an ugly Irish collie . Now , imagine that the Pekingese were able to talk to you ! And you have a portrait of any beautiful woman you care to name . My late wife , for example , God rest her soul . " He rolled his eyes to the ceiling and threw another log on the fire . It was Christmas of 1922 . Why could n't I have seen that he already knew my secret  --  that in his oblique way , he was trying to goad me into revealing myself ? If I had understood , the magic might never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't forget , you can always crawl in with each other if you feel lonely , boys ! " <p> " Thallie ! " It was Robby 's slurred voice . " Wife , come here ! " <p> I startled . I blew out the lamp nearest the window and pressed my hands to the screen , framing the two figures . She stood near the window , graceful even when she was motionless . He circled the fountain toward her , backlit by the lamps on the far veranda . Brute menace was in the set of his shoulders and the swing of his fists . " Thallie , you are n't to go to bed with that man . " <p> " You 're being a silly drunk , Robby . It 's just a game . " <p> " It 's not a game . It 's your whole life . Do you know what they call you at the Muthaiga Club ? And at every house in the country ? " He sneered . " The Whore of Gilgil . " <p> He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <p> " Please go to bed , Robby . " Her voice was shaky . They circled each other . I prayed Robby would succeed in claiming his marital rights : I dreaded her coming . " I 'll see you in the morning , darling , " she said . " I love you . " <p> " Then come to bed with me ! " <p> " Do you want to know why I do n't sleep with you , Robby ? Do you really want to know ? " Her voice scaled higher . " Because you stink . Your body is pocked with heroin abscesses . You 're killing yourself and I wish you would do it faster and get it over with , because I hate you , I hate you , I I drew back from the window and she rushed in like a gust of wind , trailing the scent of Chanel and whiskey . She slammed the door , fell against it and burst into tears . <p> " Do n't take it too seriously , " she managed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , this fight , every time he gets drunk . I hate him . I hate him . " <p> Outside , Robby splashed his face in the fountain . Then I heard footsteps staggering away . A door slammed . <p> " I hate him ! " <p> " Lie down , Thalia . " I began edging toward the door . The alcohol had begun to leave my head , and I had cold feet . All I could think about was getting away . " I 'll fetch you a drink . " <p> " I do n't want a drink . " Her gaze burned through the tears . " I want you . " <p> " No , you do n't . " I was almost at the door . " Will I have to tell you why ? " <p> " To hell with your confessions ! " She came at me , pushed me against the column of the four-poster and buried her face in my jacket . " I do n't want to know when your mother died , who you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They all tell me everything , everything , and I 'm so burdened . . . so burdened . . . imprisoned . . . . I just want to fuck you . " <p> She wrenched at her pink satin gloves , hurled one then the other at the parakeet cage . " Do n't be shy . We do n't expect proper behavior from you - not like at Home . This is the wilderness . " <p> " Wait ! " I pulled away . " Do n't you know I 'm a murderer ? " <p> " Of course I do . Credit me with a little self-interest . " She sat down on the bed , picked up one foot and began to peel off the stocking . " We agreed we would n't mention the Mallow case to you . It does n't matter , even if it was rather gory . Everybody who comes to Kenya is running away from something . Why , even Williams , who did n't want to kiss Chantal ( not that I blame him ) , he committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : you 're handsome , you 're mature , and you may or may not have killed a man . " She snuggled against me , arms snaking around my neck , and kissed me full on the mouth . <p> A flash flood of sensation rushed through my body . The magic uncoiled and stretched . Terrified , I pushed her away . <p> Shadow pooled in the hollow of her collarbone as she stretched one arm toward me . The hoopoes cried piercingly on the veranda . Her voice came from deep within her . " Come here . " <p> " You 'll be sorry . Just wait and see . " I yanked off my jacket . Haste made my fingers clumsy . Button by button , I undid my shirt and tugged my vest over my head . Last of all I unknotted the strip of cotton that keeps my breasts flat . Shame suffused my face with heat . " See ? You do n't want me  --  " <p> Her eyes were wide , like little cameos , reflecting my nakedness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . . . " <p> " Of course ? " <p> " How could I have thought your face belonged to a man ? Those cheekbones . . . " Soft , hot hands fastened on my shoulders . She pushed me back onto the bed . " Those lips . . . " She kissed me again , for a longer time . <p> " Stop ! " I writhed away , pressing my face into the counterpane . <p> " What 's wrong ? Have n't you ever made love to a woman before ? " One finger traced up and down my quivering spine . " No , you have n't . " Her voice shook a little . " How is this ? " <p> She kneaded my shoulders . <p> " This ? " <p> " Stop it ! " <p> Her hands ceased to move . " Tell me why you 're living like this , Francis . " <p> " My father wanted a son . " I found it difficult to concentrate . She bent and kissed my cropped hairline , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother died when I was born , and Father treated me as a boy from the first , although naturally he could n't send me to public school . We lived alone in the Irish countryside . None of his acquaintances knew I was n't what he said . And since I did n't have a female nurse , I was n't sure of the difference myself . " <p> " What happened when you got your monthlies ? " <p> " I did n't know . " I shuddered . " My God , I might as well have been turning into an ape ! I was so frightened ! The servants twigged pretty quickly . One summer day , the son of my father 's manservant , a boy my own age , decided to enlighten me as to what I was becoming . That included both of us taking our clothes off . You can guess what the next step was . " <p> " Yes , I think I can . " <p> " You ca n't possibly . " <p> " He raped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And ever since , you 've been afraid it will happen again . Well , not tonight it wo n't . " She stroked my neck . " Let Thallie make it better . " <p> Eighteen years of deception , holding the magic in , blindly denying it . I killed the boy , reduced him to bleeding , bubbling jelly . Then I ran weeping to the stream that flowed through the grounds , where I washed myself raw . My father hushed up the boy 's death . Make it better ! I wanted to laugh . <p> " I like making love to women . " Thalia sounded both shy and bitter . " Men call me their goddess , and then they have to own me in order to feel safe . They fight over me like dogs with a bone . And I end up broken into little pieces . That 's why I left London . Here , there are few enough men that every jackass knows that if he waits , he 'll get his turn . " <p> " Poor Thalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity me ! Just make me feel the way I make them feel . Make me free . " Her weight came down gently on my back . She had taken off her blouse . Her nipples burned spots on my shoulders . <p> The magic overflowed my body , tossing me from side to side , lifting me off the bed . <p> Had I ever thought to control it ? No . The other times , deep down inside I had n't wanted to control it . Now when I did , I realized the true power of my instincts . <p> I pinned Thalia down as I had pinned Charles , grasping her face with both hands , and where my fingers pressed her temples the skin was pouring into soft folds , spilling over her hair . <p> Not again ! I wo n't repeat my crime ! <p> Feverishly I pulled back . I took a deep breath . <p> The fox-terrier whined at the door ; the parakeets chirped plaintively . Far off , a lion coughed . <p> The border between myself and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been so important to keep it intact . <p> I touched my forefinger to Thalia 's neat nose and stroked upwards , ever so gently moving skin and cartilage . <p> She stopped weeping . She lay supine , not struggling , the tendons of her arms spasming from time to time under my knees . Now and again as I re-molded her face , she whimpered with the pain . The jewel-blue eyes overflowed with tears . The water coursed down the sides of her face until I re-formed her ears so that they stuck out far enough to catch it . <p> " I just wanted to make love to you , " she said . Her voice was squeaky , jerky with pain , a far cry from the liquid tones I remembered . " Do I deserve this ? " <p> " Do n't talk , please . I do n't want to hurt you . " <p> " You are hurting me . " She jerked . " Rather badly . " <p> " Ca n't stop now . " I touched her eyelashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the roots of her hair . The parakeets screeched , filling the room with their racuous voices . The power surged like a flood tide . " I 'm trying not to do any damage . I think  --  I hope  --  you 'll thank me for this . " <p> " Thank you ? " <p> " Please be quiet . It 's too late to stop now . " <p> I GOT UP at four in the morning and packed the Buick with things I thought we might need : clothes , food , money . Then I woke Thalia into her new life . She only cried a little before she conceded there was no question of staying at Brixtow any longer . We drove several miles up the road before we felt safe enough to stop and have breakfast . Fresh rolls , cold salmon , papaya , and fresh-roasted Kenyan coffee made short work of our hangovers . My hunger distracted me from the real question at hand : where were we to go now ? I ate , and ate , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy blue basin . <p> " I feel sorry for Robby , " Thalia said . She sat on the patch of grass we 'd flattened , wearing a dowdy skirt and blouse . Dirty-porridge waves spilled to her shoulders , and her hairline was low to her eyebrows . She had light brown eyes with stubby lashes , wide and frank . A snub nose . Her mouth was too wide , her lips too thin for beauty . Her jaw looked almost masculine . This was what I 'd done to her . " He wo n't realize this is for his good . At least , not when he crawls out of bed and finds me gone . Maybe a few months down the road . I ruined him . " <p> " It was n't your fault . " <p> " He could n't give me the freedom I wanted . So I took it . He could n't bear that either , so he turned to morphine . And now I look back on our life , I see I was n't even free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It 's easy for you to make pronouncements , Francis . . . Did you ever think of having a go at it yourself ? Being a woman , and refusing to be imprisoned ? " <p> " No . Not really . " <p> " Then perhaps you ought to try it now . What have you got to lose ? " <p> " Everything ! " <p> " Nothing . Anyway , I think you owe it to me . Ought n't you to alter yourself as drastically as you altered me ? Even if by more mundane means ? " <p> She tugged on a strand of mousy hair , touched her new , heavy eyebrows . <p> I bowed my head . " I do owe you that . " <p> She stood . " We can find out how you would look , at any rate . Come down to the car . I saw you put plenty of my clothes in , and we 're practically the same height . " <p> We walked down to the car . She rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen skirt ? " I said incredulously . <p> " That 's right . You can change behind that thom tree . " <p> It is astonishing what a difference clothes make to one 's self-image . I felt naked , uncertain , shy , yet at the same time deliciously free , the way I used to feel at night when I would take my breast band off . The thorn tree was in flower . Daringly I picked a spray of blossom and tucked it behind my ear , breathing in the heavy scent . <p> " Oh Francie ! " Thalia clapped her hands . Then she came forward and adjusted the flower so that it bobbed in front of one eye . " When your hair grows a bit longer , you can get a perm . You 'll be at the height of fashion . I 'm terribly out of date with my long hair . " <p> I had never expected to feel this free . Impulsively , I leaned forward and kissed her . She stopped me . " Do n't . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people once ? Are you afraid of getting any closer ? " <p> " I did n't say that . " There was a pause , then she said , " I thought we would go back to London . " <p> " I see . It 's because I 'm a woman . And that 's not acceptable . " On the other side of the grass , in the thorn bushes , I heard water rushing . Crimson and blue and green birds flirted across the sky , and just above the grass , insect wings flashed . I never wanted to leave this country . " I 'm older than you , Thalia , " I said , " and I 've had time to become disenchanted with human nature . For a man , living in Britain was bearable . I stayed on my estate , scarcely speaking to a soul . For a woman , society 's biases would be intolerable . We could n't even be ourselves , never mind being with each other . " <p> " I 've been in Kenya too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . If not London , then Paris or Venice . This is the age of freedom . Women are treated with equality . " <p> " Oh , if you only knew ! " We had reached the Buick again . I leaned my elbows on the bonnet , facing out into the valley . " No woman knows what she 's being cheated of until she has had it . And now I 'm giving it up , I do n't want the loss rubbed in my face . " <p> " You 're wrong . " Tears shone in her eyes . " The only thing that imprisoned me was my beauty . " <p> " I wo n't go back . " My voice was steady . I could not believe what I was about to say . " Maybe we should part . I 'm not sure we 're suited . " <p> " No , Francis ! " She hugged me . We stood pressed together in the middle of the road , hip to hip , breast to breast . In light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it made sense not to kiss her . Too many other tensions would come into play . In a sexual relationship , we would end up hating each other . We had to find solid ground to stand on before we could reprise last night . Yet I did n't warn to eliminate the possibility , as we would have to in a society that called it taboo . <p> " I do n't think I can stand to give up civilization , " she said . <p> I laughed . " I 've given up on civilization . " <p> " This may sound hypocritical  --  but I do n't want to give you up . " Her heart beat fast . I chewed my lip , trembling with fear . I knew that as we stood , unembarrassed in our true forms , we did n't belong in the world of men . But how could I make Thalia see ? <p> " Please come back to London ! " she said . " You ca n't not give it a try ! " <p> Over her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green-shad-owed , awash with dapples of sunlight .
