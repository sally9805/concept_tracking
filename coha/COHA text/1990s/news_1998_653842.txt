<p> An Egyptian gas pipeline is snaking its way east across the Sinai desert , laying the groundwork for a regional power network that could bind Israel closer to its Arab neighbors and radically change its energy and security strategy . <p> By directly fueling electric power plants , as its builders intend , the Sinai pipeline would end Israel 's dependence on sources a continent or more away for vital energy imports . Israeli officials agree that the Egyptian connection would be the easiest and cheapest way to satisfy spiraling domestic power demands . <p> But before concluding a deal , the two countries must overcome intense mutual mistrust . Egypt has irked Israel by linking progress on gas sales to the Palestinian peace talks , and at the moment the pipeline is to stop 25 miles short of the Israeli border . <p> " These decisions should be made on purely economic grounds , and economically the Egyptian project is best , " said Natan Sharansky , Israel 's Minister of Trade and Industry . " But the Egyptians have wanted to make this a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ahmed Maher el-Said , Egypt 's Ambassador to the United States , said in a telephone interview that Egypt wants the project to succeed . " If it is a question of a guarantee that the supply of gas would continue without political vetoes , this could be done with a statement of intent , " he said . " It does make good business sense . To me , it seems like this is a go situation . " <p> The new pipeline  --  originating in Nile Delta gas fields and paralleling the Sinai 's northern Mediterranean shore  --  is now being built by a 50-50 partnership between the state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and the giant Italian conglomerate ENI , a developer of Egypt 's 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves . Within two years gas is expected to begin coursing through the 36-inch-diameter , 150-mile-long pipeline to what is now its official destination : El Arish , an isolated Sinai beach town just west of Israel and the Palestinian-administered Gaza Strip . <p> The Egyptian Government has not yet made a formal offer for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " currently considering the option " of buying the gas from Egypt . <p> But the builders are banking on a deal : The scale and trajectory of the project make it clear that Israel is the pipeline 's viable market , and ENI does not disguise its expectation that the pipeline will extend well beyond El Arish . Already , ENI has signed an agreement in principle to supply gas to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , and company plans show the pipeline continuing to Israel 's three main coastal power plants . " This is a natural start for a system that could extend throughout the region , " Enzo Viscusi , an ENI spokesman in Rome , said . " It has great implications . " <p> The northern Sinai project represents the revival  --  but this time with contracts , cash and backhoes  --  of the " peace pipeline " idea discussed by Egypt and Israel in the afterglow of the Oslo peace accords five years ago . The proposal foundered with the chilling of Israeli-Arab relations after the Likud Government of Prime Minister Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Government 's assumptions on the peace process under review . <p> Egypt was unwilling to proceed with big cross-border business deals unless Israel continued withdrawing from Palestinian territories as required by the Oslo land-for-security plan . Israel was infuriated , saying its negotiations with Palestinians should have no bearing on negotiations for gas contracts . <p> In recent months , a flurry of deal-making and ditch-digging resuscitated the pipeline , at a cost estimated by ENI at more than $200 million , just as President Clinton 's Wye Plantation mediation effort led to the resumption of Israeli pullbacks from the West Bank . Mr. Clinton is to arrive in Israel on Saturday night for further talks . <p> " The situation today is that the Government of Israel wants to buy the gas , and we are waiting for a decision from Egypt to sell us the gas , " said Yosef Maiman , president of the Merhav Group , an Israeli energy contractor . <p> Six months ago , the Egyptian Petroleum Minister , Hamdi el-Banbi , declared that Egypt 's commercial gas producers would be permitted to export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resolved . The Israeli Government says it wants that policy stated more formally and emphatically . <p> The " formal consent and commitment of the Government of Egypt is a prerequisite for a natural gas supply agreement , " Israel 's Ministry of National Infrastructure said in a statement . " This is required because of the linkage made in the past , by the Government of Egypt , between the commercial negotiations and the political situation . " <p> Yet to Egypt , the two issues are inextricably related as " a matter of the general political context in the Arab world , " according to Ambassador Said . " If the implementation of the Wye agreement proceeds , " he said , " the project 's possibility of proceeding is greatly enhanced . If Wye does n't proceed , it will truly be difficult . " <p> In October , the ENI board chairman , Guglielmo Moscato , signed a provisional agreement in Ramallah with the Palestinian Authority leader , Yasir Arafat , to supply gas to the Gaza Strip . Mr. Moscato said the agreement would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fuel Gaza power plants . He called it " the first real step toward the implementation of the so-called peace pipeline project , which ENI has been studying for years . " <p> As ENI acknowledges , however , a gas-supply arrangement with the Palestinian Authority can not be concluded without the approval and technical cooperation of Israel , which controls the Egyptian-Gaza border . <p> A power plant of the size ENI has discussed building for Gaza would use no more than a tenth of the pipeline 's planned capacity of seven billion cubic meters a year , according to industry estimates . <p> But in Israel , fast-rising power demands combined with environmental and budgetary considerations have led to official forecasts of natural gas imports of four billion cubic meters a year by 2005 and 12 billion by 2015 , the Infrastructure Ministry said . <p> At the same time , recent gas discoveries have tripled Egypt 's proved reserves and export potential . Sales to Israel of four billion cubic meters a year could , even at today 's depressed prices , earn Egypt as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Israel . " This type of interdependence should be encouraged , " said Mr. Maiman , whose company 's 20 percent share of a $1.2 billion Alexandria oil refinery makes it the largest Israeli investor in Egypt . <p> Flanked by nations that were the world 's leading oil producers but also its declared enemies , Israel long ago forged alternative relationships with the biggest non-OPEC exporters , Norway and Mexico . It also bought crude oil through intermediaries on costly spot markets , and imported coal from South Africa and Colombia . <p> After the Camp David accords were signed in 1979 , Egypt joined the ranks of Israel 's suppliers , and is now providing up to a fifth of Israel 's oil imports , according to the United States Energy Information Administration . But because of the refusal of most Arab countries to sell to Israel directly , and its own fears that overland supplies could easily be cut by terrorists or the producers , Israel has never had working pipeline connections to any of its energy-producing neighbors . <p> Israel needs to make decisions soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants are casting a pall of particulates over coastal towns and beaches . Natural gas is cleaner than most alternatives , and , here in the Middle East , marginally cheaper . With energy prices at a 25-year low , this is a propitious time to negotiate supply contracts . <p> Late last month , the Infrastructure Ministry postponed until next year a self-imposed December 1998 deadline for plans on importing natural gas , expanding electrical generating capacity , and possibly converting existing plants to gas from coal . The ministry has also proposed huge gas-fired desalination plants to satisfy demands for drinkable water in the Gaza Strip . <p> The ministry said it was having exploratory talks with four unnamed suppliers of liquefied gas , though it would be priced higher than piped Egyptian gas and requires the construction of a $600 million-plus marine terminal and regasification plant . <p> At stake are billions of dollars in fuel and construction contracts . These decisions are in turn dictated by long-term strategic considerations . Though the Sinai pipeline alone could satisfy Israel 's demand for gas over the next decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including liquefied gas from Turkmenistan shipped through Turkey , an increasingly close military ally . " It is not good for us to be totally dependent on one pipeline , " Mr. Sharansky said . <p> Another Sinai gas pipeline is being planned . The Amoco Corporation , which is being acquired by British Petroleum , signed agreements in November with Egypt and Jordan to build a smaller-capacity pipeline across the Sinai , under the Gulf of Aqaba from the Egyptian port of Taba , and continuing to Amman and beyond . Nile Delta gas should begin flowing to Jordan in 2001 , through a $400 million Amoco joint venture there with Tractebel of Belgium , said Robert Clark , an Amoco spokesman in London . <p> " This is not the peace pipeline , but rather a discrete project to provide gas to supply Jordan 's energy needs into the 21st century , " Mr. Clark said . " I do n't want to preclude the possibility that this could develop into a wider regional distribution system , but that is a consideration for the future . " <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Israel , under the terms of a recent agreement between the two countries . New transmission lines across the Jordan River and systems to unite the adjoining electricity grids are almost completed , Israel reports . Israel 's electricity demands are about 10 times greater than Jordan 's , and Jordan already has the advantage of connections to Saudi pipelines . <p> Jordan and Egypt are also unifying their electricity grids , with a new power cable under the Red Sea . <p> And both Amoco and ENI have had continuing conversations with Israeli energy officials about supplying gas . <p> " There have been discussions for some time about the possibility of exporting gas via the eastern Mediterranean coast to the Palestinian Authority and to Israel , and those discussions are still continuing , " Mr. Clark said . <p> Egyptian authorities and the pipeline 's developers have also discussed building a power plant on Egyptian territory near Gaza and exporting electricity to both Israel and the Palestinian Authority . Israeli officials say they would not necessarily oppose the proposal if Egypt provided long-term supply guarantees , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insurance policy against sabotage or diplomatic reprisals . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 26 , 1999 , Tuesday <p> CORRECTION : An article in Business Day on Dec. 11 about the construction of an Egyptian pipeline that may transport gas to Israel misattributed remarks about the project .
