The damp , snapping wind iced the bones through to the marrow . Snow from a storm earlier in the week was piled in irregular hills along the side of the road . The sky was bitter blue . Stern trees with black empty branches rose out of winter-browned grass and shook their limbs like fists against the cold . That was March in Maine . Miranda pumped the heater up to full , programmed her CD player to Puccini 's La Bohme and drove with the music soaring . She was coming home . After a ten-day lecture tour , bumping from hotel to college campus to airport and back to hotel , Miranda was more than ready for home . Her relief might have had something to do with the fact that she hated giving lectures , suffered miserably every time she had to face those rows of eager faces . But shyness and stage fright were n't allowed to interfere with duty . She was Dr. Miranda Jones , a Jones of Jones Point . And she was never permitted to forget it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his mark in the , New World . The Joneses , Miranda knew , were required to make their marks , to maintain their position as the leading family of the Point , to contribute to society , to behave as expected of the Joneses of Jones Point , Maine . Thrilled to put distance between herself and the airport , she turned onto the coast road and hit the gas . Driving fast was one of her small pleasures . She liked to move quickly , to get from one point to the next with a minimum of fuss and time . A woman who stood nearly six foot in her bare feet and had hair the color of a Tonka toy fire engine rarely went unnoticed . Even when she was n't in charge , she looked as if she were . And when she moved with the precision and purpose of a heat-seeking missile , the road ahead generally cleared . She had a voice one infatuated man had compared to velvet wrapped in sandpaper . She compensated for what she considered an accident of fate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prim . But it got the job done . Her body might have come down from some Celtic warrior ancestor , but her face was pure New England . Narrow and cool with a long straight nose , slightly pointed chin , and cheekbones that could have chipped ice . Her mouth was wide and most often set in a serious line . Her eyes were Fourth of July blue , and most often sober . But now as she entertained herself with the long , winding drive that hugged the snow-laced cliffs , both her mouth and her eyes smiled . Beyond the cliffs , the sea was choppy and steel gray . She loved the moods of it , its power to soothe or thrill . As the road bent like a crooked finger , she heard the thunderous crash of water slapping against rock , then drawing back like a fist to strike again . The thin sunlight sparkled on the snow , the wind blew fitful streams of it into the air , across the road . On the bay side , the naked trees were bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms . When she was a child , and still fanciful , she 'd imagined those trees muttering complaints to each other as they huddled against the wind . Though she considered herself fanciful no longer , she still loved the look of them , gnarled and knotted , but lined up like old soldiers on the bluff . The road climbed as the land narrowed , with the water creeping in on both sides . Sea and sound , both moody , often bleak , nibbled away at the shores with a perpetual hunger . The crooked spit of land rose , its topmost point humped like an arthritic knuckle and graced by the old Victorian house that looked over sea and land . Beyond it , where the ground tumbled down again toward the water , was the white spear of the lighthouse that guarded the coast . The house had been her refuge and her joy as a child because of the woman who lived in it . Amelia Jones had bucked the Jones tradition and had lived as she chose , had said what she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart for her two grandchildren . Miranda had adored her . The only true grief she 'd ever known was when Amelia had diedwith no fuss or warning , in her sleep eight winters before . She 'd left the house , the tidy portfolio she 'd cleverly put together over the years , and her art collection to Miranda and her brother . To her son , Miranda 's father , she left her wishes that he be half the man she 'd hoped before they met again . To her daughter-in-law , she left a strand of pearls because they were the only thing she could think of that Elizabeth had ever fully approved of . It had been so like her , Miranda thought now . Those pithy little comments in the will . She 'd stayed in the big stone house for years , living alone , having survived her husband by more than a decade . Miranda thought of her grandmother as she reached the end of the coast road and turned into the long , curving drive . The house that topped it had survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shocking , and sudden heat of high summer . Now , Miranda thought with a little twist of guilt , it was surviving benign neglect . Neither she nor Andrew seemed to find the time to arrange for painters or lawn care . The house that had been a showplace when she was a child now displayed its sags and scars . Still , she thought it lovely , rather like an old woman not afraid to act her age . Rather than rambling , it stood in straight , soldierly angles , its gray stone dignified , its gables and turrets distinguished . On the sound side a pergola offered charm and fancy . Wisteria tangled up its sides , buried its roof in blossoms in the spring . Miranda always meant to make time to sit on one of the marble benches under that fragrant canopy , to enjoy the scents , the shade , the quiet . But somehow spring ran into summer and summer into fall , and she never remembered her vow until winter , when the thick vines were bare . Perhaps some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed replacing . Certainly the trim and shutters , faded from blue to gray , needed to be scraped and painted , The wisteria on the pergola probably needed to be pruned or fed or whatever you did with such things . She would get to it . Sooner or later . But the windows glinted , and the ferocious faces of the gargoyles crouched on the eaves grinned . Long terraces and narrow balconies offered views in every direction . The chimneys would puff smokewhen someone took the time to light a fire . Grand old oaks rose high , and a thick stand of pines broke the wind on the north side . She and her brother shared the space compatibly enoughor had until Andrew 's drinking became more habitual . But she was n't going to think about that . She enjoyed having him close , liked as well as loved him , so that working with him , sharing a house with him , was a pleasure . The wind blew her hair into her eyes the minute she stepped out of the car . Vaguely annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieve her laptop and briefcase . Shouldering both , humming the final strains of Puccini , she walked back to the trunk and pepped it open . Her hair blew into her face again , causing her to huff out an irritated breath . The half-sigh ended in a choked gasp as her hair was grabbed in one hard yank , used as a rope to snap her head back . Small white stars burst in front of her eyes as both pain and shock stabbed into her skull . And the point of a knife pressed cold and sharp against the pulse in her throat . Fear screamed in her head , a primal burn that burst in the gut and shrieked toward the throat . Before she could release it , she was twisted around , shoved hard against the car so that the blossom of pain in her hip blurred her vision and turned her legs to jelly . The hand on her hair yanked again , jerking her head back like a doll 's . His face was hideous . Pasty white and scarred , its features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror allowed her to see it was a maskrubber and paint twisted into deformity . She did n't struggle , could n't . There was nothing she feared as much as a knife with its deadly point , its smooth killing edge . The keen tip was pressed into the soft pad under her jaw so that each choked breath she took brought a searing jab of pain and terror . He was big . Six-four or - five , she noted , struggling to pay attention , pay attention to details while her heart skittered into her throat where the blade pressed . Two hundred fifty or sixty pounds , wide at the shoulders , short at the neck . Oh God Brown eyes , muddy brown . It was all she could see through the slits in the rubber fright mask he wore . And the eyes were flat as a shark 's and just as dispassionate as he tipped the point of the knife , slid it over her throat to delicately slice the skin . A small fire burned there while a thin line of blood trickled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The word bubbled out as she instinctively shoved at the wrist of his knife hand . Every rational thought clicked off into cold dread as he used the point to jerk up her head and expose the vulnerable line of her throat . In her mind flashed the image of the knife slashing once , fast and silent , severing carotid artery , a gush of hot blood . And she would die on her feet , slaughtered like a lamb . " Please do n't . I have three hundred and fifty dollars in cash . " Please let it be money he wants , she thought frantically . Let it just be money . If it was rape , she prayed she had the courage to fight , even knowing she could n't win . If it was blood , she hoped it would be quick . " I 'll give you the money , " she began , then gasped in shock as he tossed her aside like a bundle of rags . She fell hard on her hands and knees on the gravel drive , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could hear herself whimpering , hated the helpless , numbing fear that made it impossible to do more than stare at him out of blurred eyes . To stare at the knife that glinted in the thin sunlight . Even as her mind screamed to run , to fight , she hunched into herself , paralyzed . He picked , up her purse , her briefcase , turned the blade so that the sun shot off a spear of light , into her eyes . Then he leaned , down and jammed the point into the rear tire . When he yanked it free , took a step in her direction , she began to crawl toward the house . She waited for him to strike again , to tear at her clothes , to plunge the knife into her back with the same careless force he 'd used to stab it into the tire , but she kept crawling over the brittle winter grass . When she reached the steps , she looked back with her eyes wheeling in her head , with small , hunted sounds bubbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short , rusty breaths scraped at her throat , burned in her lungs as she dragged herself up the steps . She had to get inside , get away . Lock the door . Before he came back , before he came back and used that knife on her . Her hand slid off the knob once , twice before she managed to close her fingers around , it . Locked . Of course it was locked . No one was home . No one was there to help . For a moment , she simply curled there , outside the door , shivering with shock and the wind that whipped over the hill . Move , she ordered herself . You have to move . Get the key , get inside , call the police . Her eyes darted left and right , like a rabbit watching for wolves , and her teeth started to chatter . Using the knob for support , she pulled herself to her feet . Her legs threatened to buckle , her left knee was screaming , but she darted off the porch in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she remembered he 'd taken it . She babbled out words , prayers , curses , pleas as she yanked open the car door and fumbled with the glove compartment . Even as her fingers closed over her spare keys a sound had her whirling around wildly , her hands coming up defensively . There was nothing there but the wind sweeping through the bare black branches of trees , through the thorny canes of the climbing roses , over the brittle grass . Breath whistling , she took off for the house in a limping run , jabbing frantically with the key at the lock , all but wailing with relief when it slid home . She stumbled inside , slammed the door , turned the locks . When her back was against that solid wood , the keys slipped out of her fingers , landed with a musical crash . Her vision grayed , so she closed her eyes . Everything was numb now , mind , body . She needed to take the next step , to act , to cope , but she could n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nausea rose up in one long greasy wave . Gritting her teeth , she took one step forward , then another as the foyer seemed to tilt gently right and left . She was nearly to the base of the stairs when she realized it was n't her ears ringing , but the telephone . Mechanically , she walked through the haze into the parlor , where everything was so normal , so familiar , and picked up the phone . " Hello ? " Her voice sounded far away , hollow like a single beat in a wooden drum . Swaying a bit , she stared at the pattern the sun made as it slipped through the windows and onto the wide planks of the pine floor . " Yes . Yes , I understand . I 'll be there . I have ... " What ? Shaking her head to clear it , Miranda struggled to remember what she needed to say . " I have some things ... things to take care of first . No , I 'll leave as soon as I can . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize as hysteria . " I 'm already packed , " she said , and laughed . She was still laughing when she hung up the phone . Laughing when she slid bonelessly into a chair , and did n't realize when she tucked herself into a small , defensive ball that the laughter had turned to sobs . She had both hands wrapped tight around a cup of hot tea , but she did n't drink it . She knew the cup would shake , but it was a comfort to hold it , to feel the heat pass through the cup and into her chilled fingers , soothe the abraded skin of her palms . She 'd been coherentit was imperative to be coherent , to be clear and precise and calm when reporting a crime to the police . Once she was able to think again , she 'd made the proper calls , she 'd spoken to the officers who had come to the house . But now that it was done and she was alone again , she could n't seem to keep a single solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miranda ! " The shout was followed by the cannon bang of the front door slamming . Andrew rushed in , took one horrified study of his sister 's face . " Oh Jesus . " He hurried to her , crouched at her feet and began to play his long fingers over her pale cheeks . " Oh , honey . " " I 'm all right . Just some bruises . " But the control she 'd managed to build back into place trembled . " I was more scared than hurt . " He saw the tears in the knees of her trousers , the dried blood on the wool . " The son of a bitch . " His eyes , a quieter blue than his sister 's , abruptly went dark with horror . " Did he ... " His hands lowered to hers so that they gripped the china cup together . " Did he rape you ? " " No . No . It was nothing like that . He just stole my purse . He just wanted money . I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it myself . " " It 's all right . Do n't worry . " He tightened his grip on her hands , then released them quickly when she winced . " Oh , baby . " He took the cup from her hands , set it aside , then lifted her abraded palms . " I 'm so sorry . Come on , I 'll take you to the hospital . " " I do n't need the hospital . It 's just bumps and bruises . " She drew a deep breath , finding it easier to do so now that he was here . He could infuriate her , and he had disappointed her . But in all of her life , he 'd been the only one to stick with her , to be there . He picked up her cup of tea , pressed it into her hands again . " Drink a little , " he ordered before he rose and paced off some of the fear and anger . He had a thin , rather bony face that went well with the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , though his hair was a darker red , almost mahogany . Nerves had him patting his hand against his thigh as he moved . " I wish I 'd , been here . Damn it , Miranda . I should have been here , " " You ca n't be everywhere , Andrew . No one could have predicted that I 'd mugged in our own front yard . I thinkand the police thinkthat he was probably going to break into the house , rob us , and my coming home surprised him , changed his plans . " " They said he had a knife . " " Yeah . " Gingerly she lifted a hand to the shallow cut on her throat . " And I can report that I have n't outgrown my knife phobia . One look at it , and my mind just froze . " Andrew 's eyes went grim , but he spoke gently as he came back to sit beside her . " What did he do ? Can you tell me ? " " He just came out of nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He yanked me back by the hair , put the knife to my throat . I thought he was going to kill me , but he knocked me down , took my purse , my briefcase , slashed my tires , and left . " She managed a wavering smile . " Not exactly the homecoming I was expecting . " " I should have been here , " he said again . " " Andrew , do n't . " She leaned into him , closed her eyes . " You 're here now . " And that , it seemed , was enough to steady her . " Mother called . " " What ? " He started to drape an arm around her shoulders , and now sat forward to look at her face . " The phone was ringing when I got into the house . God , my mind 's still fogged , " she complained , and rubbed at her temple . " I have to go to Florence tomorrow . " " Do n't be ridiculous . You just got home and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can she ask you to get on a plane right after you 've been mugged ? " " I did n't tell her . " She only shrugged . " I was n't thinking . In any case , the summons was loud and clear . I have to book a flight . " " Miranda , you 're going to bed . " " Oh yeah . " She smiled again . " Very soon now . " " I 'll call her . " He sucked in his breath as a man might when faced with an ugly chore . " I 'll explain . " " My hero . " Loving him , she kissed his cheek . " No , I 'll go . A hot bath , some aspirin , and I 'll be fine . And after this little adventure , I could use a distraction . It seems she has a bronze she wants me to test . " Because it had gone cold , she set the tea down again . " She would n't summon me to Standjo if it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quickly . " " She 's got archeometrists on staff at Standjo . " " Exactly . " This time Miranda 's smile was thin and bright . " Standjo " stood for Standford-Jones . Elizabeth had made certain that not only her name but everything else on her agenda came first in the Florence operation . " So if she 's sending for me , it 's big . She wants to keep it in the family . Elizabeth Standford-Jones , director of Standjo , Florence , is sending for an expert on Italian Renaissance bronzes , and she wants one with the Jones name . I do n't intend to disappoint her . " She did n't have any luck booking a flight for the following morning and had to settle for a seat on the evening flight to Rome with a transfer to Florence . Nearly a full day 's delay . There would be hell to pay . As she tried to soak out the aches in a hot tub , Miranda calculated the time difference and decided there was no point in calling her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed by now . Nothing to be done about it tonight , she told herself . In the morning , she 'd call Standjo . One day could n't make that much difference , even to Elizabeth . She 'd hire a car to take her to the airport , because the way her knee was throbbing , driving could be a problem even if she could , replace her tires quickly . All she had to do was ... She sat straight up in the tub , sloshing water to the rim . Her passport . Her passport , her driver 's license , her company IDs . He 'd taken her briefcase and her pursehe 'd taken all her identification documents . " Oh hell , " was the best she could do as she rubbed her hands over her face . That just made it all perfect . She yanked the old-fashioned chain plug out of the drain of the claw-foot tub . She was steaming now , and the burst of angry energy had her getting to her feet , reaching for a towel , before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she braced a hand against the wall and sat on the lip of the tub , the towel dropping in to slop in the water . The tears wanted to come , from frustration , from the pain , from the sudden sharp fear that came stabbing back . She sat naked and shivering , her breath trembling out on little hitching gasps until she 'd controlled them . Tears would n't help her get back he papers , or soothe her bruises or get her to Florence . She sniffled them back and wrung out the towel . Carefully now , she used her hands to lift her legs out of the tub , one at a time . She gained her feet as clammy sweat popped out on her skin , causing the tears to swim close again . But she stood , clutching the sink for support , and took stock of herself in the full-length mirror on the back of the door . There were bruises on her arms . She did n't remember him grabbing her there , but the marks were dark gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunningly painful . That , she remembered , was a result of being rammed back against the car . Her knees were scraped and raw , the left one unattractively red and swollen . She must have taken the worst of the fall on it , twisted it . The heels of her hands burned from their rude meeting with the gravel of the drive . But it was the long , shallow slice on her throat that had her head going light , her stomach rolling with fresh nausea . Fascinated and appalled , she lifted her fingers to it . Just a breath from the jugular , she thought . Just a breath from death . If he 'd wanted her to die , she would have died . And that was worse than the bruising , the sick throbbing aches . A stranger had held her life in his hands . " Never again . " She turned away from the mirror , hobbled over to take her robe from the brass hook by the door . " I 'm never going to let it happen again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could in the robe . As she was struggling to belt it , a movement outside the window had her head jerking up , her heart thundering . He 'd come back . She wanted to run , to hide , to scream for Andrew , to curl herself into a ball behind a locked door . And with her teeth gritted , she eased closer to the window , looked out . It was Andrew , she saw with a dizzying wave of relief . He was wearing the plaid lumberman 's jacket he used when he split wood or hiked on the cliffs . He 'd turned the floodlights on , and she could see something glinting in his hand , something he swung as he strode along over the yard . Puzzled , she pressed her face against the window . A golf club ? What in the world was he doing outside marching across the snowy lawn with a golf club ? Then she knew , and love flooded into her , soothing her more than any painkiller . He was guarding her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him stop , pull something from his pocket , lift it . And she watched him take a long swig from a bottle . Oh , Andrew , she thought , as her eyes closed and her heart sank . What a mess we are . * * * It was the pain that woke her , bright pops of it that banged out of her knee . Miranda fumbled on the light , shook out pills from the bottle she 'd put on her bedside table . Even as she swallowed them she realized she should have taken Andrew 's advice and gone to the hospital , where some sympathetic doctor would have written her a prescription for some good , potent drugs . She glanced at the luminous dial of her clock , saw it was after three . At least the cocktail of ibuprofen and aspirin she 'd taken at midnight had given her three hours of relief . But she was awake now , and chasing the pain . Might as well finish it off , she decided , and face the music . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda picked up the phone and put the call through . Moaning a bit , she shifted her pillows against the curvy wrought-iron headboard and eased back against them . " Miranda , I was about to call to leave a message at your hotel for your arrival tomorrow . " " I 'm going to be delayed . I " " Delayed ? " The word was like a single ice chip , frigid and sharp . " I 'm sorry . " " I thought I made it clear this project is priority . I 've guaranteed the government that we would begin tests today . " " I 'm going to send John Carter . I " " I did n't send for John Carter , I sent for you . Whatever other work you have can be delegated . I believe I made that clear as well . " " Yes , you did . " No , she thought , the pills were n't going to help this time . But the cold anger beginning to stir inside her was bound to outdistance a little pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as instructed . " " Then why are n't you ? " " My passport and other identification were stolen yesterday . I 'll arrange to have them replaced as soon as possible and rebook my flight . This being Friday , I doubt I can have new documents before sometime next week . " She knew how bureaucracies worked , Miranda thought grimly . She 'd been raised in one . " Even in a relatively quiet place like Jones Point , it 's foolishly careless not to lock your car . " " The documents were n't in my car , they were on me . I 'll let you know as soon as they 're replaced and I 've rescheduled . I apologize for the delay . The project will have my full time and attention as soon as I arrive . Goodbye , Mother . " It gave her perverse satisfaction to hang up before Elizabeth could say another word . In her elegant and spacious office three thousand miles away , Elizabeth stared at the phone with a mixture of annoyance and confusion . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her former daughter-in-law . Elise Warfield sat , a clipboard resting on her knee , her big green eyes puzzled , her soft , lush mouth curved slightly in an attentive smile . The marriage between Elise and Andrew had n't worked , which was a disappointment to Elizabeth . But her professional and personal relationship with Elise had n't been . damaged by the divorce . " Yes . Miranda 's been delayed . " " Delayed ? " Elise lifted her brows so that they disappeared under the fringe of bangs that skimmed over her brow . " That 's not like Miranda . " " Her passport and other identification were stolen . " " Oh , that 's dreadful . " Elise got to her feet . She stood just over five-two . Her body had lush feminine curves that managed to look delicate . With her sleek cap of ebony hair , her large , heavily lashed eyes and milky white skin , the deep red of her mouth , she resembled an efficient and sexy fairy . " She was robbed ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips tightened briefly . " She 'll arrange to have them replaced and reschedule her flight . It may take several days . " Elise started to ask if Miranda had been hurt , then closed her mouth on the words . From the look in Elizabeth 's eyes , either she did n't know , or it was n't her major concern . " I know you want to begin testing today . It can certainly be arranged . I can shift some of my work and start them myself . " Considering , Elizabeth rose and turned to her window . She always thought more clearly when she looked out over the city . Florence was her home , had been her home since the first time she 'd seen it . She 'd been eighteen , a young college student with a desperate love for art and a secret thirst for adventure . She 'd fallen hopelessly in love with the city , with its red . rooftops and majestic domes , its twisting streets and bustling piazzas . And she 'd fallen in love with a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pasta , and shown her her own heart . Of course , he 'd been unsuitable . Completely unsuitable . Poor and wildly passionate . Her parents had snapped her back to Boston the moment they 'd learned of the affair . And that , of course , had been the end of that . She shook herself , annoyed that her mind had drifted there . She 'd made her own choices , and they had been excellent ones . Now she was the head of one of the largest and most respected research facilities for art in the world . Standjo might have been one of the arms of the Jones organization , but it was hers . Her name came first , and here , so did she . She stood framed in the window , a trim , attractive woman of fifty-eight . Her hair was a quiet ash blond discreetly tinted by one of the top salons in Florence . Her impeccable taste was reflected in the perfectly cut Valentino suit she wore , the color a rich eggplant , with hammered-gold buttons . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , with good New England bone structure overcoming the few lines that dared show themselves . Her eyes were a sharp and ruthlessly intelligent blue . The image was one of a cool , fashionable , professional woman of wealth and position . She would never have settled for less . No , she thought , she would never settle for less than the absolute best . " We 'll wait for her , " she said , and turned back to Elise . " It 's her field , her specialty . I 'll contact the minister personally and explain the short delay . " Elise smiled at her . " No one understands delays like the Italians . " " True enough . We 'll go over those reports later today , Elise . I want to make this call now . " " You 're the boss . " " Yes , I am . Oh , John Carter will be coming in tomorrow . He 'll be working on Miranda 's team . Feel free to assign him another project in the meantime . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John 's coming ? It 'll be good to see him . We can always use him in the lab . I 'll take care of it . " " Thank you , Elise . " When she was alone , Elizabeth sat at her desk again , studied the safe across the room . Considered what was inside . Miranda would head the project . Her decision had been made the moment she 'd seen the bronze . It would be a Standjo operation , with a Jones at the helm . That was what she had planned , what she expected . And it was what she would have .
