Autobiographical Notes I was born in Harlem thirty-one years ago . I began plotting novels at about the time I learned to read . The story of my childhood is the usual bleak fantasy , and we can dismiss it with the restrained observation that I certainly would not consider living it again . In those days my mother was given to the exasperating and mysterious habit of having babies . As they were born , I took them over with one hand and held a book with the other . The children probably suffered , though they have since been kind enough to deny it , and in this way I read Uncle Tom 's Cabin and A Tale of Two Cities over and over and over again ; in this way , in fact , I read just about everything I could get my hands on -- except the Bible , probably because it was the only book I was encouraged to read . I must also confess that I wrote -- a great deal -- and my first professional triumph , in any case , the first effort of mine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve or thereabouts , when a short story I had written about the Spanish revolution won some sort of prize in an extremely short-lived church newspaper . I remember the story was censored by the lady editor , though I do n't remember why , and I wasoutraged . Also wrote plays , and songs , for one of which I received a letter of congratulations from Mayor La Guardia , and poetry , about which the less said , the better . My mother was delighted by all these goings-on , but my father was n't ; he wanted me to be a preacher . When I was fourteen I became a preacher , and when I was seventeen I stopped . Very shortly thereafter I left home . For God knows how long I struggled with the world of commerce and industry -- I guess they would say they struggled with me -- and when I was about twenty-one I had enough done of a novel to get a Saxton Fellowship . When I was twenty-two the fellowship was over , the novel turned out to be unsalable , and I started waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it turned out , about the Negro problem , concerning which the color of my skin made me automatically an expert . Did another book , in company with photographer Theodore Pelatowski , about the store-front churches in Harlem . This book met exactly the same fate as my first -- fellowship , but no sale . ( It was a Rosenwald Fellowship . ) By the time I was twenty-four I had decided to stop reviewing books about the Negro problem -- which , by this time , was only slightly less horrible in print than it was in life -- and I packed my bags and went to France , where I finished , God knows how , Go Tell It on the Mountain . Any writer , I suppose , feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent -- which attitude certainly has a great deal to support it . On the other hand , it is only because the world looks on his talent with such a frightening indifference that the artist is compelled to make his talent important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short a span of time as I am here forced to assess , finds that the things which hurt him and the things which helped him can not be divorced from each other ; he could be helped in a certain way only because he was hurt in a certain way ; and his help is simply to be enabled to move from one conundrum to the next -- one is tempted to say that he moves from one disaster to the next . When one begins looking for influences one finds them by the score . I have n't thought much about my own , not enough anyway ; I hazard that the King James Bible , the rhetoric of the store-front church , something ironic and violent and perpetually understated in Negro speech -- and something of Dickens ' love for bravura -- have something to do with me today ; but I would n't stake my life on it . Likewise , innumerable people have helped me in many ways ; but finally , I suppose , the most difficult ( and most rewarding ) thing in my life has been the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to effect some kind of truce with this reality . ( Truce , by the way , is the best one can hope for . ) One of the difficulties about being a Negro writer ( and this is not special pleading , since I do n't mean to suggest that he has it worse than anybody else ) is that the Negro problem is written about so widely . The bookshelves groan under the weight of information , and everyone therefore considers himself informed . And this information , furthermore , operates usually ( generally , popularly ) to reinforce traditional attitudes . Of traditional attitudes there are only two -- For or Against -- and I , personally , find it difficult to say which attitude has caused me the most pain . I am speaking as a writer ; from a social point of view I am perfectly aware that the change from ill-will to good-will , however motivated , however imperfect , however expressed , is better than no change at all . But it is part of the business of the writer -- as I see it -- to examine attitudes , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this point of view the Negro problem is nearly inaccessible . It is not only written about so widely ; it is written about so badly . It is quite possible to say that the price a Negro pays for becoming articulate is to find himself , at length , with nothing to be articulate about . ( " You taught me language , " says Caliban to Prospero , " and my profit o n't is I know how to curse . " ) Consider : the tremendous social activity that this problem generates imposes on whites and Negroes alike the necessity of looking forward , of working to bring about a better day . This is fine , it keeps the waters troubled ; it is all , indeed , that has made possible the Negro 's progress . Nevertheless , social affairs are not generally speaking the writer 's prime concern , whether they ought to be or not ; it is absolutely necessary that he establish between himself and these affairs a distance which will allow , at least , for clarity , so that before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must first be allowed to take a long look back . In the context of the Negro problem neither whites nor blacks , for excellent reasons of their own , have the faintest desire to look back ; but I think that the past is all that makes the present coherent , and further , that the past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly . I know , in any case , that the most crucial time in my own development came when I was forced to recognize that I was a kind of bastard of the West ; when I followed the line of my past I did not find myself in Europe but in Africa . And this meant that in some subtle way , in a really profound way , I brought to Shakespeare , Bach , Rembrandt , to the stones of Paris , to the cathedral at Chartres , and to the Empire State Building , a special attitude . These were not really my creations , they did not contain my history ; I might search in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was an interloper ; this was not my heritage . At the same time I had no other heritage which I could possibly hope to use -- I had certainly been unfitted for the jungle or the tribe . I would have to appropriate these white centuries , I would have to make them mine -- I would have to accept my special attitude , my special place in this scheme -- otherwise I would have no place in any scheme . What was the most difficult was the fact that I was forced to admit something I had always hidden from myself , which the American Negro has had to hide from himself as the price of his public progress ; that I hated and feared white people . This did not mean that I loved black people ; on the contrary , I despised them , possibly because they failed to produce Rembrandt . In effect , I hated and feared the world . And this meant , not only that I thus gave the world an altogether murderous power over me , but also that in such a self-destroying limbo I could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only -- one 's own experience . Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop , sweet or bitter , it can possibly give . This is the only real concern of the artist , to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art . The difficulty then , for me , of being a Negro writer was the fact that I was , in effect , prohibited from examining my own experience too closely by the tremendous demands and the very real dangers of my social situation . I do n't think the dilemma outlined above is uncommon . I do think , since writers work in the disastrously explicit medium of language , that it goes a little way towards explaining why , out of the enormous resources of Negro speech and life , and despite the example of Negro music , prose written by Negroes has been generally speaking so pallid and so harsh . I have not written about being a Negro at such length because I expect that to be my only subject , but only because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write about anything else . I do n't think that the Negro problem in America can be even discussed coherently without bearing in mind its context ; its context being the history , traditions , customs , the moral assumptions and preoccupations of the country ; in short , the general social fabric . Appearances to the contrary , no one in America escapes its effects and everyone in America bears some responsibility for it . I believe this the more firmly because it is the overwhelming tendency to speak of this problem as though it were a thing apart . But in the work of Faulkner , in the general attitude and certain specific passages in Robert Penn Warren , and , most significantly , in the advent of Ralph Ellison , one sees the beginnings -- at least -- of a more genuinely penetrating search . Mr. Ellison , by the way , is the first Negro novelist I have ever read to utilize in language , and brilliantly , some of the ambiguity and irony of Negro life . About my interests : I do n't know if I have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make experimental movies can be so classified . Otherwise , I love to eat and drink -- -it 's my melancholy conviction that I 've scarcely ever had enough to eat ( this is because it 's impossible to eat enough if you 're worried about the next meal )  - -  and I love to argue with people who do not disagree with me too profoundly , and I love to laugh . I do not like bohemia , or bohemians , I do not like people whose principal aim is pleasure , and I do not like people who are earnest about anything . I do n't like people who like me because I 'm a Negro ; neither do I like people who find in the same accident grounds for contempt . I love America more than any other country in the world , and , exactly for this reason , I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually . I think all theories are suspect , that the finest principles may have to be modified , or may even be pulverized by the demands of life , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center and move through the world hoping that this center will guide one aright . I consider that I have many responsibilities , but none greater than this : to last , as Hemingway says , and get my work done . I want to be an honest man and a good writer .
