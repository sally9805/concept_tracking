Ms. VAUGHT STEWART-POORE she is , my wife , cold as her father 's money in bed , etcetera , etcetera . This would crack the whip , but I 've already lied . But I am working up to , as they say , the burning mystery , and I 'm too much the coward , almost , to write it down real , which is plenty . <p> Face in expensive cobalt mud , she was horrified when I walked in on her masturbating , looking in the mirror with her face like that ; knees up , head sideways to the long mirror by the bed , face in blue mud ; she moved and bucked with her hand down there , naked except for her Las Vegas floorshow heels . What could she mean by this , she so recently a mother for the first time , at forty ' Horrified , but she was too far into it , she could n't stop the last little bucks . Was as if I were a little boy unprepared , inadvertently , who had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you think she 's being hurt , gravely . It was like that an instant . I felt little , diminished into fear before the adult part came back , but was I sorry that I had seen or was I wildly set off , when I closed the door and went away saying nothing , nothing , then the both of us acting as if nothing had happened , though the image roared in my inner theater , maybe to roar forever ? With the whole horny sky and her sister , maybe , in it too . <p> Her sister lives with us . I 've never known whether she likes me or not . She is the sort who carries her catbird seat around with her . I do n't think she ever had anywhere at any time any idea but that she was thoroughly wanted and adored . She is slightly better looking than my wife , more elegant in the shoulders , though I believe my wife 's legs are better . In conversation and inner decision she and my wife Vaughtie are replicates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with stern , almost angry , punctuality . Their practiced , only slight tardiness to everything  --  they do nothing , really  --  you could set your clock by . The scheduling of the day is something they picked up from their father , whom they mocked , but who insisted on a structure for the day , which is what he had instead of theology or hope , I believe , as if pure form answered for the eternal . But this man had actual things to do and made a great deal of money selling  --  seems almost antiquarian now  --  " let-us-meditate " spots to radio and television stations . His sincere belief in his " product , " his small bow ties , his profound squareness in merchandising the " thoughts " of Swedenborg , Pascal , Voltaire , Carlyle , Emerson , and Wilde ( anything pithy and uncopyrighted , really ) , they hailed with derision , as if he had failed goofily at something and they were not using his money every hour , until it ran out and Vaughtie , at thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well poor , I can tell you that . I 've always had a tiny messiah complex concerning her and her sis . <p> Vaughtie , besides her beauty , had an expensively and leisurely acquired knowledge of cultures , almost encyclopedic , although nothing at all in it had touched her much . She simply was familiar with an untold number of beautiful and true things , but was one of those women who would allow them no profundity . I was very attracted to this , and I am not , trust me , attacking women of a certain spoiled type who lie in the bed jaded and cold as their father 's money , etcetera , etcetera . I loved this about her . When I was in college I learned a few things deep and permanent in the arts and sciences , but they all made me sad . I have never been more miserable than at school , knowing these urgent truths , and stalking the campus with them , fat with them as a man in the old freak tents , and as morbid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about the life of Van Gogh , and I am one of them . Intensity and mania , that grasping and clasping of life , one 's life not even available to one fully but belonging rather to posterity , where it breathes and is adored , comfortable . Say like Christ , too . If you took him seriously , could you even have a tennis game without guilt ? Space , creation , the atom  --  how can a man think soberly of these things , knowing that everything is having at each other constantly , nothing at peace , and persist in his merry clod-like way ? So she was my queen , Vaughtie , the one who knew but " would not give it the honor of taking it seriously . " I saw that quoted somewhere in regards to the requirements of " reality . " I also knew she could n't truly love , three evenings after I met her , and liked the way this shut out , after all , all competition for her heart . You would only get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice river . I know what most men want is the quality of Old Shep , waiting at a Montana train station twelve years for his master who 's been taken off dead in a coffin to the East , but there are other qualities of marriage , rather strangely enjoyed . <p> The small tolerant smirk she showed during our lovemaking was about the most anything got out of her . Experimenting in bed , I worked for the closed eyes and tight , near release of a full smile that would signal she had crossed over into warmer abandon , into something near Van Gogh and all that . Nothing surprised her , hardly anything got her there , though she spread and bent willingly into every attitude of desire . But those rare real smiles , or something near them , with her mouth suddenly open , that is what I strove for and what delighted me , spilling forth jubilantly when I got her there . She , without censoring herself , will begin her convulsions . It is all the rise I ever see from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , and for a goodly while her coolness , generally , was my treasure . It was what we had . We had made something from nothing , as they say about dance . But I could n't have this for long , or very often . <p> Between the makers and the critics , I 'm afraid Vaughtie would be your critic of life and the world . These people , many of them well-off , say they never asked to be born . They refuse to live fully in what they did not choose . If the world wants to be a sort of nursery with toys in it for them , then they are slightly pleased . Something else far more important was happening far away from wherever Vaughtie was , you sensed , but you never found out what that thing was . Her sister was , if I saw it right , the only person who could commiserate with her on these points . <p> Why is the sister even here , with us , if she annoys me , and harbors under our roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair , Vaughtie and Deborah . A matter beyond argument , a matter something like birthright . Vaughtie might gaze at you as if you had asked are your lungs going to live here too ? She would not have seen your point . It has always been that they are inseparable except on a few occasions like honeymoon . I ca n't remember the others . Number two , they can talk and measure the world with nobody else . It is as if nothing is real , nothing going on , until the other has attested to it . Yes , the water 's cold . Is n't this delicious ? Yummy . Was n't the music dreadful ? I could n't believe the music . Do n't you like Nick 's haircut ? It 's perfect . <p> I am Nick Poore . <p> Then they will comment on what each of them is wearing today . It is as if they are looking in a dresser 's mirror at another outfit they would have worn but for no good reason did n't . Both of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would peg , even though no couturier , as owing some allegiance to the chic thirties , a decade prominent in knees and cheeks . They seem sculpted , with square bangs and long necks , one blonder than the other . <p> But now we all have grown older . What this has done is , since Vaughtie 's almost forty , having discussed everything , they were going to do something , definitely . They became quieter in their alliance , more serious . I found a sentence underlined , printed on a card that fell out of Vaughtie 's purse . Why do I pretend ? I looked in her purse frequently for signs of personality and passions . This is what I found once when she was in the tub : " Nothing that happens after we are twelve matters very much . '  --  Sir James Matthew Barrie . " Never had I noticed her remarking a particular assertion of anybody 's . This was the author of Peter Pan , and did n't he plead with the audience once that they must , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same man . From all cultures , she had written down this single observation . So , out there on the porch , or in the gazebo , or in the lounge chairs next to our small pool , the two of them were out there adoring their youth , that was it . They could n't get over their youth . They were looking for it in each other . They were inseparable because they had such a high estimation of their youth . I noticed how they boasted about the other , how the other was entirely better at , say , sports , and a singular cause of envy . Then the other would protest about her own envy of the other in art , imagination , room decor . But no , the other was so much more advanced in ideas . Still , no , what about the other 's singing voice , could n't she just thrill you like a bird having at it outside the window ? Then sometimes , when I approached , coming home from work or mass , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could carry on the contest , this duet of mutual admiration and envy , while I was there  --  payer of the mortgage , utilities ; owner of the cars , provider of food , yard help , billee of every salon and tennis club they visited ; patron of their very slimness and suntans and pedicures  --  trying to make ordinary chatter . Soon I 'd give up and dress for my cellar range , where I practiced the bullwhip on cigarettes and shot exotic small-caliber pistols . I would give a show of being slightly wounded by their obliviousness . I had tried to support them in their decision to do something worthy , and here I was patronized , shunned . This show , only partly felt , would bring me sympathy and restitution from Vaughtie later when we were alone . <p> Charity and pity brought on a kind of solicitous pornography in her , if you can stand that horrible statement . That and the fact that above all things , Vaughtie adored being viewed , from all angles . The languid eroticist , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have made an exquisite model . I sometimes wondered about her at the doctor 's , to whom she was always going , even though by all I could tell she was in perfect health . Vaughtie was faithful to me , by the way . Infidelity was not one of her electives , I do n't think . Yet the sacred chambers at the doe 's could have been another kind of official narcissism , as hypochondria has been described . <p> Now , you see , here we are back at college again . These thoughts , what are they good for ? What is the worth of knowing these items , that she and her sister were forever reworshiping their youth , that they were talking mirrors , that feigning hurt brought payment almost instantly in gratifying my lust ; that Vaughtie insisted on being viewed ; that she was a dedicated narcissist even to the point of hypochondria ; that it was ridiculous for me to be fiscally responsible for two inconsequential pattering women in my backyard or on couches . These are miserable things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's no profit in this smartness , this comprehension , and having described them , what have you done ? Simply taken another photograph , of which the world has etcetera , etcetera . <p> Great collections of things  --  libraries , museums , bookstores , repositories , even car lots  --  make me sad . The plenitude of culture , words , and artifacts , everywhere you look , brings on a tightness in my chest . I am wishing , always , more people had shut up and stayed still or just run off . Now what about J. M. Barrie , re Vaughtie : " Nothing that happens after we are twelve matters very much . " So what ? Are Vaughtie and Deborah sad old children , gabbing away out there , and alas we are all just obsolete children as said by another describer , another smart boy ? Shake our heads , another blooming truth attached to the long snarling list in our brains ? <p> Give me tunnel vision , I say . Thought is very overrated , no ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , straight ahead . You pick the right tunnel , pals , and there is a lot in there , more than you can handle . Shut up , get what you can , carry on , like Vaughtie maybe , a woman saddened by her inconsequence now , but a thing for which she has been preparing lifelong . She is a figment , a joyful thing to think about , a statue with blood in it . <p> There is always something going on that has nothing to do with our precious insights , usually much better ; the insights stand like an old spiteful bum at the back door , nose on the glass . Life throws open the door , stomps over his back making for the pool , the polished sunsets we have out here . Another Vaughtie , a real one , has wit , grace , charm , and a certain deferential reverence for things completely unlike her  --  my going to church and being a brigadier general in the Guard , for instance . It was fun listening to her and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the way she walked . She stressed appearance and was resigned to her own surfaces . But some surfaces are deep , positively refreshing . I have never found her monotonous . I think of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , who has no real personality as far as I can tell ; you would n't put her on a list of those with soul . But she continues to fascinate , and any demonstration of mere common sense on her part is viewed as damned near sacred . She arouses perpetual salivation in any number of gasping busybodies . The cameras eat her up . <p> Vaughtie has probably long ago absorbed Jackie . Almost all easy rhythm , the way she moves ; that sort of fresh caution , like a deer on a golf course , can make you gasp , even now she 's forty . Her sister , without quite the moves , shadows her  --  a woman less developed , but prettier , with a set of shoulders that would launch a boat or two . <p> There is a plaster head on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filtered cigarette and stand back various distances up to fifteen feet , the length of the bullwhip . I hardly ever miss the cigarette . The explosion of paper and tobacco still causes rare happiness in me . I have had a friend shoot this in slow motion , without me in the frame . You see the whip 's end fall out of a curl and the fiber of the nylon kiss the tube , whereupon the thing leaps apart in shreds of white and brown . I am no freak for videoing anything that moves . I loathe the world of compulsive videoers and the zealous scum it invites , a whole new class of idiots . This reverence for the moving image seems even more frantic the less there is to our country and the public fools who stagger around trying to shape our hearts and minds . Nevertheless , I have one video of Vaughtie , almost by accident . My friend Amos left his machine at my house when the slow motion of the cigarette was done , and I picked it up , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew Vaughtie and Deborah were dressing to go out . There was a two-edged new excitement in the house . Vaughtie had come up pregnant . And I was about to go off with my unit to Desert Storm . I knew she feared for my life , with missiles and gas and so on . I acted solemn , but I was hugely excited . Back to this in a while . Could I get Vaughtie on the rest of this tape , right at the beginning of the long downward curve into age ? She was frightened , being forty . I could tell . There 's a gloss that goes off , no matter how well you keep yourself . The bloom simply goes away , on women and all of us , and it is instantly detectable . No surgery for it , no vitamins , no exercise . You will have that look of usage on you . You see some people change just about overnight . But I found the new fear in her eyes very beautiful . Now with her concern about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was showing up . Flat in the middle of everything here in lovely San Diego we had us a war . I 'd never been near real " action . " Well , in my youth I helped integrate a university back down South . I was the same age as some of the students throwing brickbats into our windshield . The weekends and the summer exercises , where I became good with tanks , had marked me , as later in the San Francisco earthquake , but I did an enormous amount of sitting and wasting taxpayers ' money , and had rehearsed at war only about a twentieth of my whole time in the Guard . We were going over with the French Foreign Legion , who had a good deal to prove , as did we , since Vietnam . My job would be a boring pussy job in supply , but nevertheless I was beaming inside , like a Christmas child . Vaughtie and I needed the separation . Now I could take something of her with me . <p> With no plan , just lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bathroom mirror before she knew I was around . She was in a half-slip with her nude shoulders to me , looking at herself . Then she said something aloud : <p> " Everybody 's dying . Everybody . It 's something they have to do . " <p> So I was there , camera raised , catching her voice and movement when her head went down , her hands on the sides of the lavatory , and she stared into the drain of the sink , where , when you thought about it , a great deal of her self had perished . But let me tell this : when she said what she said , the tone of her voice implied that she was not including herself . Everybody else is what she meant , as if everybody but her were going to some wretched ball , and only because they should . She seemed to be in the act of deciding whether to go herself or not . There I was , another creep with a camera , hearing this and spying into her privacy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost pathetic , she looked so vulnerable , I had the camera down and acted as if I 'd just come in . <p> " What 's this ? Is n't that Amos 's ? " She smiled . <p> " Memories in the Persian Gulf . Memories of you , Vaughtie . " <p> I lifted the camera and began shooting . She was teased but she liked it and held a few attitudes for me : the vagrant wife , chaste , shocked ; well , have your way . She was a long lovely woman and probably could have made a decent screen " presence . " She did n't mind being seen at all . In fact , that might be her occupation , though some would view this as a nasty enslavement . I wondered if she did . <p> It was not definite to me whether she wanted the child . I did , very much . I had never learned truly to relax , a great flaw . I could have done the same I 've done and more and had a better time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax and achieve that sweet ease of soul that better men have . I 'd always worried and missed much life because I was forever away somewhere else in my head . This is a horrible thing , to have missed half your life , worrying it away . Baby , do n't fret , the mother says to the little one . They should keep up the message , never forget . I 've been instructed that out of our inklings of disaster met against the flow of hopeful tranquility the brain also provides , great work emerges . That 's what Amos , essentially a lifetime bum with a camera , says . <p> The worst dilettante , but a fine man , Amos told me Vaughtie , unlike many beauties he 'd known , was , at least , not mean . Women told they were beautiful over and over grew to resent the world because it did not automatically give great rewards to them , so that everything began sounding like derision and cheap talk . When the compliments stopped , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this , said Amos . In that way , I figure , it would be dangerous to laud a child too much . The entrance to the outer world would be the birth trauma all over again . I was already getting a loose program ready for the little one . But what about Vaughtie ? <p> Pregnant at forty , she was likely to be torn down further , physically , by this late arrival , an accident . I 'd heard somewhere , yet , that women 's brains were " softened " by birth and they were never intellectually the same afterwards . Did she sense this ? She would be let out to the democratic pasture of " breeders , " never a real individual again . Maybe I should n't have listened to Colonel Mario , a secret gay in our unit , so much . But the man is brilliant and does the better headwork for our division . He could run the show easily if I dropped dead of poison gas , etcetera . Some days it frightens me that I 'm third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other good vets like Nimrod under me . My good service in the San Francisco tragedy , the very thing that thrust me over to brigadier , amounted to little more than releasing Mario and Nimrod to work their best , which was always swift and clicking . <p> Vaughtie 's pregnancy had caused not a great , but slight , distance from her sister . I 'd noticed Deborah would look at her sister with a baffled , even scared , expression on her face , and was more likely to listen to Vaughtie and quiet herself . She was not so forthcoming anymore . They did n't talk of old times in their rare ecstatic youth much . Mario said that , on the positive side , pregnancy gave a woman her first taste of true power and independence . She felt , deep in her soul , that there was nobody else like her and her child . This made her happy in her work , the only distinctive work you got from merely being . A man had nothing like it . Labor was a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among women , an unstated aristocracy of the pregnant woman existed , felt and respected by all . <p> Another ponderable was the happy accident , a thing that seemed to know and relish fate , that she became pregnant while the war was threatening and knew about it the day I got my invitation . This made me feel very special . We had inadvertently prepared for my death , had we not ? A change had come over me . At my most content , having done some work , and composed as I ever get , I felt so good I would n't mind death . This was nothing like that chummy bravado but secret fear I had in my youth . This was a soothing , low-burning indifference to my fate , almost a chemical high . Death appeared as simply another interesting possibility , as appropriate as , say , suddenly taking up bird-watching . My mother was very composed the last year of her life , a thing that mere tiredness did not account for . I wondered if there were a beautiful surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared you for death . Am I vain , am I clutching at miracles and crutches , when I 'm enjoying the appearance of new life in Vaughtie as mine is soon passing ? I wondered . I was n't tired at all . With the best ease I surrendered myself to my heir and infant . <p> The tyranny of the visual . <p> Amos talks about this ; Amos , a man who lives by the eye , but calls his work ashes . He got this from a book and here I am back at college again . He has to take nitroglycerin tablets for a heart condition . Maybe it 's Amos that reminds Vaughtie of death coming on , to others . Then the war comes , and I am the next carrier of it . Amos has a sort of Old Testament smile on him , a doomed twinkle in his eye : all is vanity . Most of what we do is vanity . But Vaughtie stopped his heart , too , along with Deborah . The two of them froze vision , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough and vulgar , some hauler of coal , smeared with grease , muttering and bumping into glassware . We knew that to the holy hermit in rough cloth  --  a man somewhere in most of us , no ?  --  they meant nothing , that they were idle and vain , but the eye was overjoyed and sent old hairy judgment out the door . <p> The war went , as everybody knows , handsomely for our side . I was busy and proud , more alert than frightened , eye on the sky every now and then . Young captains were smarter than I was , and better-looking . Most of them had startling bodies and nimble minds , and they looked incredibly young . They could handle tanks much better than I. I mourned the justice of my position , an old man with no history signing orders out of twenty warehouses . I sat down once , outside , with a cigarette and envied a French private all sunburned , about six-two , lithe , needing no cigarette , with the deathly joy of the pro in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got into the Guard , I recalled , because of seeing men like him in a couple of movies . I believe I even started smoking because one of them smoked , and smoked very bravely , this actor . That and music . Sousa , Tchaikovsky , Beethoven I 'd heard  --  the grand , the martial , the fascistic , I guess . Even Copland 's " Fanfare for the Common Man " made me want to pick up a rifle and move rapidly somewhere , anywhere , give us a direction , give us a cause . Is there any better feeling than standing out of the hatch with a tank under you all-out ? A tank is just about it as the great land bully of our time . Be tall and want it . I chuckled , remembering how they put little Dukakis in one of those things for a photo op and just about ruined him , he seemed such a dufus . <p> When I could call home , with still a month to go over there , I got what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong with the reception  --  did n't sound right . She seemed short , maybe bitter . I could n't get to it . <p> " Look , " I said , " are you ashamed of me being over here ? " <p> " I guess I am , husband . " This was Vaughtie 's familiar term with me . I think it indicated some mirth  --  marriage , etcetera  --  and seriousness  --  I mean loyalty  --  at the same time . " It just seems like a long Guard weekend with war games . You ground up those people like a kid writing a movie . " <p> " You 'd prefer more casualties ? " <p> " There were casualties , plenty , husband . But you just seem silly and stupid and mean , on that desert over there . " <p> " Well , I 'll be damned . " <p> Vaughtie began crying , a thing she hardly ever did . <p> " No . I 've been terrified for you . Those awful dumb missiles . But , you 're grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear , they 're calling him a genius , but Schwarzkopf , on television , he seems like this puffy cartoon person in his camos , and  --  " <p> " Now wait . " <p> " I 'm not right , either . Something 's happening to me . I 'm so dumb . And I really am sorry about this phone call . I love you so . Part of me 's just ecstatic about us and you . But it seems so selfish . " <p> " Well , you 're pregnant , Vaughtie . " <p> She laughed . " I 'm scared , and that seems selfish . " <p> The word selfish had n't ever occurred much in our marriage . Nor had love , for that matter , though I think we had it from time to time . Since we were no more selfish than our friends , I had stopped thinking of it and California , which I thought was composed entirely of selfish and asinine babies when we first got there . But this thought had sunk into the relative obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California . <p> I walked out into the back lot to have a smoke and think , which I 'd promised myself not to do and been much happier for . That same French private , back from triumph and glory , was lazing around with some others . He had on earphones with a Walkman . He was looking very pleased , eyes closed , a little away from the other soldiers . I got really nosy , an act I hate usually . I asked him what music made him smile so . He handed me the headphones , kid 's glee in his expression . He told me it was Jane 's Addiction . <p> " How can you stand that shit ? " I joked , but the music really was paralyzingly awful to me . The rest of them laughed . They were all fans of Jane 's Addiction , and seemed no worse for it . It was very strange to know they had driven into war with that stuff in their ears , very strange . This must have showed on my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to leave , I know . So I did , and my smile was phony . Those long echoing guitar chords , loud surly nonsense , went out into the desert from my mind and nearly made me puke . In it I heard the scream of Vaughtie , the scream of many women , protesting . Demons and banshees shrieked down the wind . Seemed there was only one possible music for the times  --  awful . <p> I did an awful thing when I got back to San Diego , with a hard and tan body . I began carrying on with a Chinese-Hawaiian girl who played flute in the orchestra at the Marine base . It was very calculated , too , and begun in spite , right as the baby had just a month to arrive . She was a " clean " woman who said she 'd had things twice before with " clean " married men who were mildly alluring to her . A clumsy , airless predicament was what it became ; two people staring past each other 's shoulders at something limping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , although it was surprising how her face changed toward the lines of a vampire , even as I boasted inside about my conquest . This was n't her fault . I knew she was lovely and that my eyes were deranging her . Corporal Ho was intelligent , and tender in her memories , calm music in her voice . But you wind up one afternoon gasping , snarled in the chest . I had come up a flight of stairs into the apartment and let myself in . She was n't there . She was n't there . This California sunlight , falling in from late afternoon through the sliding glass doors , this sunlight that exonerates everybody out here , was working the exact opposite on me . I was simply a gaudy , strutting worm revealed , with a tape of a cigarette exploding at the end of a bullwhip in my hand , like a million video monsters crawling around the land with their special captured moments to reveal . I sat on the couch , like a ruined , sensitive old man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the girl was n't going to be home . After the cigarette exploded , Vaughtie came on , bare-shouldered in the bathroom , her trim back to me , then put her hands down on the lavatory . <p> " Everybody 's dying . Everybody . It 's something they have to do . " <p> Now I heard it as a description of me , off dying in this low arrangement with the flutist , while my wife was back at the house preparing life . <p> Once I was visiting a movie lot at the invitation of an assistant-director friend of mine . We stood silently on the set and watched the pet director of another technical thriller  --  a tall man , very stern , who had once been a doctor . A young beauty walked over to him and gave him a long cigarette , which he took without acknowledging her . I sighed and whispered my appreciation of the woman to my friend . " Oh yes . One of his . And he has many , many . " This tall current " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to another struck me as a really nauseating exercise in power . I was surprised I did n't envy him . When the movie came out it was dreary ( just like him , I moralized ) and generally ignored , which I enjoyed : a series of computer screens and multiple whiz-kid gimmicks involving the deaths of a bunch of women , not a hint of character anywhere , and employing that special American monster , the hip aging man , James Coburn , with the moves of a Nebraska lizard . I recalled the looming pomposity of the director on the set , clenching my teeth . I wrote a note and left the girl , everything a bad choice , myself sadder and dumber for it all . <p> Vaughtie and Deborah were in the big room when I got in . Vaughtie was imminent in her pregnancy , draped in something simple and chic , soft , with a mild flower design on it . Deborah was in a girlish shift and her tan was dark , warm on the slopes of her shoulders . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the both of them as infants , and they were very serious about mending it . Their ignorance of the Chinese-Hawaiian girl made them seem unbearably virtuous , especially Vaughtie . When I smiled at her I could n't focus on her face . She had been away in her realm a long time . Even though she made rote apologies , it was clear I was a redundant culprit growing hazier to her . At any given moment she could turn indifference or pity on me . The scraps of me left to her regard seemed incapable of arousing anything larger . <p> Colonel Mario , after our parade , had told me to " really hump " Corporal Ho , the flutist : " Do n't hold back , if you 're going to cheat . Do it thoroughly . It 'll only destroy life if you do it halfway . " Well , here again I 'd missed  --  an old man in supply , a miserable half-fucker . I eased down to my basement range , put the tragic Roy Orbison in my CD player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were going to have a girl . Father of a girl at fifty years old . <p> Throughout my life an imperative had run in my head , maybe from some old movie or play I ca n't remember . It was simply a part of my memory , strangled under some burning bridge . There had never , not through the years of work with employees , nor the decades of my arrival to the brigadiership , been an occasion to bring it out . No moment offered itself as propitious , no dramatic swell provided for it . It consisted of the lines , " Get out . Get out now . " No , I had been surrounded by competence and sweet cooperation . But then , down on the range , wet-eyed over Orbison with my pistol spitting , I suppose I grew bold and nuts . There may never be an opportunity . My discontent swirled all around Deborah . I could imagine her whispering in Vaughtie 's ear all these years , and especially during the war and through her pregnancy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . How weak of me to be afraid of her beauty , as I 'd been . Up the stairs I went , already hot and wet around the collar , handkerchief dabbing at my eyes . I took a posture at the door of the big room . Both their heads were down , working over the last slat . <p> " All right , Deborah . Get out . Get out now . " <p> The sisters looked up , neutral in their faces . The tenor of Roy Orbison was pining from the basement . I made an occasional joke , parodying my brigadiership now and again . I suppose they thought it was this odd humor from me , and they froze to suffer it . But then they understood my face . <p> " Nick , whatever do you think you 're doing ? " asked Vaughtie . <p> " Deborah must go . We are poor now . Things have changed . We need a dog , " I improvised . <p> " We are not poor . Stop this . You were bragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just bravado . Hard times are on . " <p> Deborah spoke . " Did you really say , Get out . Get out now ' ? " She seemed near laughing . <p> " I did . " I wished that Orbison were not singing so high , so desperately now behind me . <p> " What should I do , Vaughtie ? " Deborah said , getting nervous with her comely limbs . She should n't have asked Vaughtie . She should still have been looking at me . <p> " What have you ever done ? " I said . " But conspire . Bump around and gab . " <p> " You 're a lunatic , Nick . You 're going through some awful lunacy in yourself . " Said by Deborah . " A dog , for heaven 's sake . " <p> " Dogs go with babies . A big old hairy mutt . " <p> " Do n't aunts go with babies too ? " asked Deborah . Incredulous , she was beginning to cry , or wanted Vaughtie to think she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " <p> " I never  --  " <p> " Shut up . You need a board across your ass and a cup to beg your fucking supper with . " <p> " Nick , God ! " Vaughtie pleaded . <p> " What do you think , we 're aristocrats ? " <p> I had expended myself . I backed down to the range , wishing Orbison would also shut up . He did . There I stayed for a long , long time . <p> Good soldierly coward , I got into the Black Jack , and glowered at the walls of the range . I cut up a carrot from the fridge and ate along with the bourbon . You ca n't hear much upstairs from here  --  built that way . I was glad they could n't hear me roar . Not from the mouth . There seemed to be a loud noise in my head as I plunged around trying to find something greatly worthy in myself . <p> The thick door opened at the top of the stairs . Slowly , her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced into  --  a thing that brought on immense sympathy in me  --  Vaughtie came down with her big stomach ahead of her . I was ready for the worst . You ca n't have it out with a woman that pregnant . She was wearing , of all things , a near smile , as if something miraculous had not quite been explained to her yet , and she was waiting . <p> " Deborah 's gone , Nick . Why , husband , have you waited all this time with that on your chest ? " <p> " It 's just . . . the time . Husbands get to help make nests , too , do n't they ? They have to prepare the way . Do n't wolf fathers help ? " <p> " I do n't know . I 've been too dumb to learn anything for several months now . You saw that on television ? " <p> " I believe so . Yes . " <p> " I 've not let you into this very much , have I , General ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . " <p> She looked down the range then at the targets and the pedestal with the head and the cigarette stuck in its lips . She smiled fully all of a sudden , the miracle having been explained , all wild bliss  --  or insanity . <p> " Are you still good with that whip ? " <p> " Yeah . The last of somebody . Not much call for your whippist . " <p> " Do me . " <p> " You do n't mean . " <p> " Take the cigarette out of my mouth with your whip . " <p> She waddled past the gun counter and over to the head , removed the cigarette , put it in her mouth , and stood in front of the plaster head on the pedestal , in profile . <p> " See if you 're any good , General . " <p> It was n't me , my being any good . The bigger question was this smiling surrender of Vaughtie , this loony adventure . She was waiting on the miracle from me , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unusual arena of will . I 'd been drinking . She was stone sober , her hands behind her back , steady , like a martyr . Two of them , she and the baby girl , in two profiles . <p> You can believe I measured this one , but not very long . My hand went up past my ear , then my arm flashed back . I do n't think I ever hit a better one . The air was white with paper , the leather drawn back , coiled in my palm , and I looked through the haze at her lips , where the filter stub was still in her pout . <p> " Very good , husband ! I ca n't say that does n't hurt a little , though . " <p> She turned toward me , her hand going up to her mouth to take the stub out . Some tiny fragment must have blown out and cut her in the explosion . A thin stream of blood was coming off her lip . She did n't even know it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just then . <p> " Vaughtie ! Oh my Vaughtiel " I raced to her with my handkerchief and covered her with my arms . She was surprised and some saner when she saw the blood in the white cloth . She just put her head down and let me moan out my apologies . But she did n't make much of the little cut , and we became very close . <p> Our baby girl came the next week , in much joy after a short labor . Now I felt thrilled , almost hot with love , really in love with both of them . The big hairy dog was waiting for us at home , with Colonel Mario . On the phone he said Deborah had come by , very timidly , to look at the dog , and they had chatted . He liked Deborah . He could talk to her . He almost would n't let her go home . <p> My joy was so big I began to get guilty , and I did feel selfish , finally . Me , to love this wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin , and this baby girl , born with full , neat , almost a wig of hair . Just a couple months ago I was in the thick of the desks , providing for the death of all those poor Iraqis . It was true , what Saddam Hussein said . We cared more about our pets than we did the Iraqis . But the further scandal was that we cared more for our pets  --  old Barney  --  than we did our own neighbors and certainly our sisters-in-law . It did seem a sin to have all this now , but of course I flexed this right out of my conscience pretty soon . <p> I got the phone one afternoon when mother and daughter were sleeping . It was Deborah . She said she wanted to speak to me , not Vaughtie . <p> " Nick , you know our famous zoo . " <p> " Yes . Yes . The San Diego Zoo . Where do I belong , Deborah ? " <p> No , no , it was n't that at all . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field trips around the zoo , and she loved it . She wanted to thank me for doing what I had , the best thing that ever happened to her . I had set her free of a long , not wholly healthy confusion about themselves and their dependency . She was very loose and happy and maybe even in , just a little bit , love . She wanted to thank me for having a friend like Mario . They were just , just , getting on . . . swimmingly . She found Mario 's loyalty to me very touching . I was lucky . And so was she . She was all ready to be a good , loving . . . but ( she giggled ) miles-away aunt . <p> You get this rarely and it even feels dangerous , all this warming neat happiness in a bundle like the end of a Shakespeare comedy that " knits up the raveled sleeve of care . " Then there will come something , and pretty soon , something going back to Vaughtie 's statement about everybody dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed in down in the basement , and the trickle of blood ; then on , pow , to I walk in on her six weeks later in the bed with her face in blue mud , having at it with her aerial lover , bucking involuntarily , having at herself , only those Las Vegas floorshow heels on , silver ; and I shut the door , bump . There is no possible way to ever discuss this . It is not an uncommon male dream , is it ? These things are filmed . These things are thrown out of your night musings . But she was enjoying it so , better than ever with me  --  beyond the full released smile I worked for , beyond everything . When you see your own wife , well . I was holding the baby . I was thinking baby things these weeks , while she was going on into another change . I am aroused . That blue mud , though , that blue mud . And you think of some blue huge man , bigger than me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusts . You ca n't stop it . It is almost holy . <p> Without any explanation , she began going down in the basement . <p> I could hear her cracking the whip , feebly at first , but then the full crack . Something would hit the floor and break . I 'm holding the baby , I tell you . She seems older , but deeper in beauty , and almost angry with lust . I 'm holding the baby up here , hoping I wo n't hear it , her call to me . I think even her voice is a little deeper . <p> " Husband . Come down here , would you ? Bring your cigarette .
