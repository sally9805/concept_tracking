THE C-NOTE , AS IT USED TO BE CALLED in Raymond Chandler novels , will never be the same . To frustrate counterfeiters , the Treasury Department has given the $100 bill a complete overhaul , and will begin releasing the new currency in a matter of weeks . Treasury spent nearly 10 years on the redesign and has added any number of state-of-the-art features : microprinting , color-shifting ink , a polymer security thread . The most striking alteration , however , is the enlargement of Benjamin Franklin 's portrait : he now dominates the bill like a movie star in a newspaper advertisement . <P> The money we carry around is so familiar that whenever a new bill or coin is introduced , it creates a ripple in our workaday lives . But not much more than a ripple , and since few people use $100 bills regularly , most Americans will greet the arrival of the new note with no stronger emotion than curiosity . Some foreigners , by contrast , have become decidedly worried by the news of its impending arrival . Around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular  --  is often treated as the ultimate repository of value . The Federal Reserve estimates that two-thirds of all U.S. cash circulates outside America . In nations where inflation is high and where there are few credible banking institutions  --  from Latin America to Africa  --  people save and conduct business in $100 bills . And with the U.S. issuing new $100 bills , many abroad are worrying that the ones they already have are about to become worthless . <P> The fear is most widespread in Russia . The Russian Central Bank estimates that somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion of U.S. currency is in Russia , about 80% of it in the form of $100 bills . Everyone from small savers to businessmen to members of the Mafia relies on hundreds , so the changes in the bill are causing high anxiety . Last week Maria Meshkova , a single mother , was in line outside the Novogorodsky currency exchange in Moscow 's Old Arbat Street . There was fear in her voice as she explained she had already changed her meager supply of $100 bills into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split her last remaining $50 bill " just in case , you never know . " She feared that the new hundred might somehow make her fifty less valuable . <P> For Meshkova and other Russians the news of a reissued $100 note revives bad memories . In the winter of 1991 , when then Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov suddenly announced that citizens had three days to exchange their rubles for a newly printed currency , they could turn in only the equivalent of one month 's salary . The old rubles were declared worthless , and millions of Russians lost their life savings . Then in 1993 the government made another sudden decree , which meant that Russians again had to exchange a limited amount of old money for new , with the transaction stamped in passports to prevent repeat visits .
