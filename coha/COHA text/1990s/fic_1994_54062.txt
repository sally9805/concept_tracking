ContentsSTRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING # THE INFANTS ' CLASS <p> It was amazing because it was so beautiful , little silver specks far up in heaven . . . <p>  --  New York Times , 14 June 1917 <p> WENDY FIRST SAW THE WONG-wongs from her old nursery window . She had the afternoon session , so she was lunching with Mother in the garden , demolishing cucumber sandwiches  --  when she heard the drone of engines , growing louder , filling the summer sky . <p> " Aeroplanes , Mum . " She set down a half-eaten sandwich and dashed into the house , taking steps two at a time . <p> The tiny square of blue above the garden was hopeless for aircraft spotting , but the nursery was three floors up . As a girl Wendy had flown about it in her nightshirt ; now it was littered with back numbers of Flight and Aero . A Montaul poster advertised the Grande Semaine d'Aviation held at Rheims before the War  --  a woman in bold print colors waved at aeroplanes and balloons rising on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for Peter . Wendy flung it wide . <p> Roofs and chimneys poked into endless sky . From the direction of Woolwich came the double throb of inline engines working in pairs  --  the Wong-wong that gave Gothas their nickname . She slung a foot over the sill , held tight to the sash and leaned out . Pavement lay in wait thirty feet below . <p> " Watch yourself , " Mother warned . <p> " Tosh , Mum , do n't be a snooze . " At twenty-two , working as a war-time temp , Wendy was no longer practiced at climbing rooftops . She no longer believed pixie dust and lovely thoughts would keep her aloft . But this was the window Peter had flown through . She never expected to fall from it . If she did , Peter was bound to be there to catch her  --  or so she supposed . Leaning farther out , she saw little silver specks in diamond formation , three miles above the Royal Albert Docks . As they got closer she counted seventeen , coming up the Thames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . <p> People peered out windows or stared up from the street . A woman shouted , " Hun bombers . " <p> Neighbors scoffed . " Not ' ere . Not over London . " <p> " Bloody Wong-wongs , " the woman insisted . " I heard them over Maidstone last month . " <p> Wendy saw nothing alarming about the orderly formation  --  until white puffs of anti-aircraft fire appeared in its path . When they reached Liverpool Station she saw bombs start to fall , and yelled to Mother , " We 're under attack . They are bombing Tottenham Court . I can see the smoke . " <p> " Twenty to noon , " Mother reminded her . <p> Wendy swung back into the nursery . She 'd be late for afternoon session , and she had the infant 's class . What did sixty-four quarrelsome kindergartners know about the war and air raids ? She dashed downstairs . Mother pressed a fresh cucumber sandwich into her hands . " Here , eat this on the bus . " Wendy fled the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specks separate , one gaggle headed south across the Thames , the others turning north toward Dalston . She was not the least frightened by this grand show , put on free for the citizens of London . People craned their necks in the street . No one searched for shelter . Nothing matched the innocence of that first daylight raid . <p> At the North Street stop an officious bobby told her , " Take care . Bombs been falling hereabouts . " <p> She nodded hastily . " I work in a basement . " The infant 's class in North Street School was below ground level , in a large partitioned basement with three stories of older children 's classes overhead . Wendy could not picture a safer spot  --  protected by God 's Grace and tile floors . <p> The peeler touched his helmet . " Then you 'd best get to your work . " She started off fast , to please the bobby  --  not afraid , just late . Heavy smoke hung over Southwark . Warehouses were burning , but the planes themselves had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East End  --  new to being bombed , she supposed the raid was over . Wendy Moira Angela Darling was as raw as the rest of London . <p> Half a block from the school she came on the crowd , and heard the clanging firetrucks . She jostled her way to the front . Frantic mothers combed the throng , jerking dazed children around to search their faces . Cries of thanksgiving mixed with agonized wails . Wendy grabbed a teacher . " What 's happened ? " <p> " Angela , where were you ? It came through the roof , dragging an older child with it . " <p> Wendy let the woman go , pushing into the school , descending into the wrecked basement . The bomb had hit the roof , split in two , and punctured three floors before exploding  --  as though an invisible hand guided it to the infant 's class . Sailors carried out the wounded in blankets , sobbing as they worked . Only the dead remained at their desks . Wendy began brushing off dust and rubble , straightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had seen maimed children before , scores of times  --  but always in Neverland , where death and life are dreamlike things . In London it was too horribly real . All she could do was cry and wipe at blood with the hem of her dress . <p> A week later , a full quarter of the infant 's class was lowered into a common grave at East End Cemetery , with the Bishop of London doing the services . Condolences came from King and Queen . Black floral wreaths read  --  " To our children murdered by German airmen . " Only two of the dead were more than five years old . Feeling ran so high the King swiftly changed the royal family 's name  --  Windsor sounded more British than Saxe-Coberg-Gotha . <p> Wendy never went back to North End Schools . She never wanted to be in the building , which heartless people were busy repairing . What could she say to the children who survived ? She hardly knew what to say to herself . She had always lived full out , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded , overrun . The War had been a far-off brainless endeavor that tootled along without her , as distant as Neverland , something in the papers to be taken with morning tea . Zeppelins prowled at night , scattering bombs . Endless " pushes . " Draft after draft of young men sent off . Michael was a railway engineer  --  exempt . John was a balloon observer , somewhere in France . Peter was in Neverland , fighting pirates . One was as real as the other . <p> Mother used to rummage through her mind at night , tidying up unpleasant thoughts . But now Wendy had grown up  --  a day ahead of other girls - and she lacked Peter 's knack for forgetting . Images stayed with her , a smashed chair , charred rubble atop a broken child . If she could not forget , she needed to do something , or die inside . Mother thumbed through the papers , hoping to find a place for her . " They say they need nurses ' aides . " <p> " Should n't wonder , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as rapid-fire guns puncture them  --  there 's a useless task . " She had seen enough of mangled young bodies . <p> " There are great cries for young women to do munitions work . " Wendy made a mouth . " Totally ghastly . Sitting in rows , screwing fuses into shells . A thundering bore , unless your shop chances to blow up . I 'd rather be a balloon observer . " <p> " Really , dear ? " <p> " My , yes . Open air work , getting God 's own view of France . I could plot shell bursts as neat as John . " <p> " No doubt . But they are n't asking women to do that . " <p> " Or I 'd even bomb a German aerodrome . " Wendy had no desire to kill Germans  --  not the way she and Peter had cut pirate throats when she was a child . But bombing them back seemed letter perfect . " They say the Wong-wongs are based in Belgium . " <p> " They do n't want women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Russians have women pilots . Two princesses have already signed up . " <p> " What would you expect when the prime pastime is flogging the serfs ? Makes America seem civilized . " Mother gave her the sweet mocking smile that reminded Wendy of Peter , showing off the one kiss you could never get . <p> There was the usual riff in Parliament over the raid . The Minister of War proudly announced , " not a single soldier had been killed . " Not just a lie , but a stupid one as well . The MP for the City of London wanted the bells of St. Paul rung backwards in case of attack  --  " So bank clerks would be warned to get the money back in the vaults . " Young Winston Churchill 's prewar promise that enemy aeroplanes would be met by a " swarm of hornets " was sarcastically recalled . Wendy doubted any man in office cared a fig for the infants ' class , until she read a crack fighter squadron was to be brought back from the front . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowed . " To be based in Bekesbourne , between London and Flanders , directly in the path of the attack . There 's my billet . Fliers straight from the front , probably in desperate need of mothering . " <p> Mother raised an eyebrow . " We do n't know the Royal Flying Corps wants young women hanging about their aerodromes . " <p> " Oh Mum , it would be a pilot 's dream . " <p> She took the train to Canterbury  --  in cricket weather , a beautiful hot blue day with hardly a cloud . Perfect bomber weather as well , with southeast England laid out like a plate . Getting to the aerodrome was alarmingly easy . Fliers from Fifty-sixth Squadron were roaming the streets of Canterbury , searching for willing young women . She was swept up in a crowd of pretty barmaids and errant school girls . By dinnertime Wendy was standing in an evening dress at the edge of the field , sipping French champagne , while a pair of pilots stunted to impress them . White tables glittered with silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen , brand new Scout Experimentals . SE5 biplanes , bristling with machine guns , speed built into every line , their long lean fuselages half taken up by Hispano racing engines . Climbing a thousand feet a minute , they looped , rolled , and plunged into screaming dives  --  all without the least sign of coming apart in midair . And she never expected the fliers to be so young . One of the stunters , Ryan Donnelly , was introduced as an " old man "  --  at it over two years  --  a strapping young Irishman who had survived the Fokker scare , the Battle of Somme , Bloody April , and the latest push in Flanders . That spring he had turned nineteen . At twenty-two , Wendy felt twice his age . <p> She danced with this pink-cheeked killer under a candle-lit marquee , while the squadron band played brassy music  --  " Pack up Your Troubles " and " Swanee River . " Ryan was able to say the most appalling things in a sweet Irish brogue . When she complimented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major scouts the depots . Aims to have the best squadron band in the bloody RFC . Whenever a new horn player or violinist shows up , he swaps them for some fellow who 's lost his nerve . " <p> She mentioned the raid . Ryan replied , " Capital bit of work . God bless Old Jerry . God bless the Gotha . " He sounded like Peter giving a cheer for the pirates . " Hope the Kaiser gives them all medals . " <p> " You ca n't really be glad it happened ? " She thought of children dead at their desks . <p> " Lord yes . A week ago I was doing dawn contact patrols against really nasty Huns , brutes who were having us for breakfast . Damned active and dangerous . Now I 'm sailing about on a head full of bubbly , with a smashing girl in my arms . Not above time , if you ask me . " <p> She was surprised , and pleased , being called a girl again , even by a smiling madman in RFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake . Was this Peter grown up ? Wendy no longer waited by the nursery window , but still had Peter in her heart  --  the wild terrible boy who had taken her beyond the sky , vowing never to give her up , then forgetting to come back . Ryan had the wildness , the cool cutting disdain , but he was more cynical and clearsighted than Peter could ever hope to be . He spun her around the dance floor , then led her out onto the long grass , buoyed by the band music . A single SE5 scout stood parked at the near end of the field , gaunt and angular , its upper wing topped by a Lewis gun , reminding everyone what Fifty-sixth Squadron 's business was . What the party was about . <p> " Kiss me now , " he suggested , holding tight to her waist , hair tousled , tunic open . This was what war demanded  --  lightning dalliance . Instant love making . No time for tedious romance . Posters on every street comer proclaimed the only man worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him quick . Death was in the wings . " Ten days and I 'll be gone . " <p> " Ten days ? " She was aghast . <p> " Back to France . " <p> " What about London ? " <p> " Come , do you think a government that wastes two-thousand a day in the trenches frets over babies and shopkeepers ? Only more bombing will bring us back . " <p> She insisted that was barbaric . <p> He gave a snort . " A flier fresh up from school lasts barely a fortnight at the front  --  that 's barbaric . Ten days is a lifetime . Two months and you 're an arrant coward , or a stone cold assassin . Maybe both . " Ryan did not need to add that he had been at it two years . " Do you know what we 'd do if we got our hands on one of your baby-killing Gotha pilots ? " <p> " Folks in the East End aim to bring back the rack and buming irons . " <p> " We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert , then pack him off to a prison camp . Because there is no enemy more barbaric than the bloody Royal Flying Corps . " The band played " Tipperary " in the background . This lost boy 's hands had gotten inside her wrap , one in the small of her back , the other working down her spine , pulling her closer . <p> " So you have no scruples ? " <p> " Gawd , I hope not . Ca n't afford ' em in my line of work . Not if yew plan ta die of brandy an ' old age . " <p> With their lips about to touch , she whispered , " Promise to take me flying . " <p> " Impossible . " He pulled back , looking askance . <p> " Why ? " <p> " An SE has only one seat . " Ryan nodded at the plane , silhouetted by the bandstand . <p> " There are plenty of other types . " Wendy was heartless . Paris might be one big knocking-ship , with Red Cross nurses handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected Ryan to die without ever fucking a real English virgin . Besides , she knew she would get nowhere by being the accommodating doormat . " What if I told you I had already flown beyond the stars ? " <p> He frowned . " I 'd say you had wandered . Gone with the Faeries . I 'd get in trouble  --  rules forbid taking female mental cases up for a fling . " <p> She leaned closer , letting one hand cup her breast . " How much trouble ? " <p> " Done deal . " He kissed her , harder than Peter ever had . A lewd sensual kiss , his tongue exploring the comers of her mouth . French girls must have taught him that . Wendy came away feeling a good deal less of a virgin . <p> " Now , take me up , " she told him . <p> " Not tonight . " Ryan eyed the party sprawled over the field . " Too chancy . " <p> " When ? " <p> " Tomorrow at twilight . Got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual controls . " <p> He looked shocked . " Where does a proper young lady learn about dual controls ? " <p> " Where did you learn to kiss like that ? " <p> " Righto . Dual controls . " They walked back hand-in-hand . <p> Next evening a big angular two-seater waited alongside the SE5 . Ryan met her at the edge of the aerodrome with a flight helmet and leather jacket . " Here , take these . I 'll help you aboard . Curl up in the front cockpit , so the mechanic wo n't see you when he spins the prop . " <p> " What sort of plane is it ? " <p> " BE2c . Prewar bus . Grandmother could fly it , and probably did . Built to give Jerry something to shoot down . " Both the BE2 and the SE5 were Royal Aircraft factory designs . Side by side Wendy saw the family resemblance -a stately old Lady and her ripping young grandson . Ryan gave her a dash of quick instruction , with cheerful references to ground loops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into the front cockpit , through a tangle of bracing wires . " Keep your head down , while I fetch the mechanic . " <p> Wendy waited , head between her knees , bursting with anticipation , listening to Ryan whistle a jaunty air and joke with the mechanic . To be safe , she did not look up until they were aloft . When she did look , she gasped . She was flying again . Not flying free like with Peter  --  but suspended in a fabric box , with nothing to hold it up , just a madly racing engine and wires everywhere . Air pressure bellied the wing fabric . Thirty-seven feet of wingspan might seem ample on the ground ; up here it was nothing as much a marvel as pixie dust and lovely thoughts . After years of living with memories , it was like touch or sight returning . Flat landscape slid beneath the lower wing , green woods , dark brown fields , gray cloud shadows . Dim blue lines of smoke rose from towns and country houses . Far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc on the horizon . She felt free for the first time since leaving the infant 's class . <p> Ryan cut the engine . Dead silence . She expected to fall , but they kept on flying . He tapped her on the shoulder , shouting , " You 're in a glide . Try the controls . But do n't pull back the stick . You 'll stall us out . " <p> Gingerly she pushed the stick forward . The nose dipped . The glide became a dive . Seeing the ground rush up , she eased back . " Not too far , " Ryan shouted . " Try a left bank . " <p> She banked left . God , it worked . She had done it . Land rushed by between the wing tips , getting closer . " Keep going , into a turn . Righto . Rudder . Ailerons . " She leaned into the turn . The machine leaned with her . Over we go . Think wonderful thoughts . <p> " Good girl . Try the other way . Aim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ground hurtled at her . At the last instant Ryan restarted the engine . She hopped hedges and trees , setting down in the fallow of a Kentish field . <p> Wendy was wildly exhilarated . " Now let me do a takeoff . " <p> " Too risky , " Ryan told her , doing his utmost to take advantage of her exhilaration , though there is only so much advantage to be had in an open field from an excited female wearing a full-length dress , layers of petticoats , and a leather flight jacket . <p> She jerked his hands out of her jacket . " Teach me to take off , or I 'll find a flier who will . " <p> " Gawd , you 're the one with no scruples . " <p> " Ca n't afford ' em . " <p> He let her take off . She saw sunset from the air , a rim of fire sinking into black cloud banks . Darkness spread over the earth . Wendy imagined she hung alone under the first evening stars  --  with Neverland below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For more than a week she stole flights . Ryan called her a born pilot , but it was really all that flying with Peter . She found herself hoping the Good Old Gothas would return  --  before Fifty-sixth Squadron was sent back to the front . Two days shy of the deadline , she saw the squadron scrambled . Men raced for their planes . SE5s roared into the air . But the Wong-wongs disappointed everyone , barely crossing the coast to bomb Felixstowe Naval Air Station , breaking windows in Harwich and slaughtering a flock of sheep . None of the pilots scrambled in Kent so much as saw a bomber . <p> On Ryan 's last night she took him to London . The Bloody RFC did not let its fliers dance in public , but Wendy discovered a club in Kensington that flouted the law , supplying fliers with drinks , music , and a dance floor . Red-coated old doormen , smiling hostesses , and a Black jazz band conspired to give airmen on leave a good time  --  couples swayed illegally around the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto hung above the bar : Work Like Hellen B. Mary . <p> She spent half the night drifting with the rhythm , her head on Ryan 's shoulder . Then they took a turn standing on the roof walk , a narrow sooty platform looking over chimney tops onto the lights of Kensington Gardens , where Peter first ran off to be with the faeries . For Peter 's sake she had tried to avoid growing pains , but now she was putting childhood behind her . At twenty-two it was not before time . Feeling a sudden urge to say what she liked , she whispered to Ryan , " Do n't go . Stay here . Keep teaching me to fly . " <p> " Afraid the Huns will shoot me down ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " They might . But if I do n't go , the RFC surely will . Refusin ' ta fight is business for a firing squad . I do n't fancy standing with my hands tied and a hanky over my face , puffin ' a cigarette while nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Baron 's more sportin ' than that . " <p> She stared hard , betting that behind that fine spoiled conceit he was scared down to his socks . " Have you ever killed a man ? " <p> " Several for sure . " <p> " And seen them die ? " <p> " The last time was a Rumpier over Poelcapelle . Engine caught fire . The pilot jumped at fifteen-thousand feet , to save himself from burning . Observer rode the bus all the way in . Not the same as sticking someone wi ' a bayonet and seeing him squirm  --  still a fairly raw business . " <p> " But you never held someone down while two boys slit his throat ? " <p> " Not much call for that in the Flying Corps  --  one of the reasons I like my line of killing . " He asked where she ever got such notions ? <p> She shrugged . " Oh , I 've done it . Scores of times . " <p> " You 're more mad than I am . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars . One twinkled down at her , saying , " Silly ass . " <p> They took the train back to Canterbury . At dawn she stood at Bekesbourne aerodrome watching the squadron rev up . The SE5s took off , formed into flights , and wheeled toward France , disappearing into a glorious cloud-free sky . Twenty-four hours later the Gothas returned , flying in neat fan-like formation into the heart of London . No horns gave warning . No sirens sounded . Their approach was so low and leisurely no one around Wendy supposed the aeroplanes were German until the bombs began to fall . <p> Peter struck . John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate 's mouth to stifle the dying groan . . . and the carrion was cast overboard . A splash , and then silence . <p> " One ! " ( Slightly had begun to count . ) <p>  --  Peter Pan , J.M. Barrie <p> STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING <p> <p> BY SEPTEMBER the bombers came only at night . No one called them Wong-wongs anymore  --  Londoners knew the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombed was long forgotten . When the Prime Minister toured the East End , mobs of women rioted , jeering at the bobbles sent to force them back to factory and kitchen . Wendy did not join in , but she understood , and planned her own revenge . Planes were brought back from the front  --  but not Fifty-sixth Squadron . Aircraft went straight from the factories to Home Defense , despite howls from the RFC brass , who hated the notion of even a single flier escaping the carnage in Flanders . Fortress London was ringed with airbases , balloon aprons , and anti-aircraft guns , which merely forced the raiders to return by night . People learned a new phrase to go with Gotha - " the bombers moon . " <p> At first there were parties in the Underground , people drinking and joking long after " All Clear . " Bobbles had to be sent down to drive them back out onto the streets . As moonlit nights dragged on , the parties ceased , sanitation overflowed , tube stations reeked , trains stopped running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in the path of the bombers , took to sleeping in the Essex countryside . Wendy herself never sought cover , not expecting a bomb would get her until she did what she meant to do . At night she strolled past omnibuses abandoned in the middle of wide thoroughfares , like wrecks on a moonlit sea bottom . Walking was the only way to get about . There was not a taxi to be had , or a light to be seen except for the stab of searchlights and the flashes of anti-aircraft batteries . Thousands of shells were thrown into the night sky by blinded and deafened gunners , firing until their barrels were red hot despite torrents of water pumped over the guns . Some nights falling shells caused near as many casualties as bombs  --  but they had yet to bring down a bomber . <p> In Flanders a new push was on , full of blood and fury . Wendy had no worry of it winning the war before she got her whack in . Ryan had written her , " the brightest lights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this is another absolutely brilliant scheme to move the mud about , and kill countless boys . " <p> She did not see Ryan again until he tipped her that he would be visiting a French aerodrome near Dunkerque . Wendy took the cross-channel steamer to France . The French did not mind their fliers getting female attention . Wendy was feverishly entertained by the Third Escadrille of Les Cigognes , the Storks . The RFC acted as if it was ashamed of its airmen , but the Aviation Militaire took a Parisian approach to pilot morale  --  the top French and American fliers were grouped in special escadrilles , with special insignia and first rate fighters . Nothing was too good for Les Cigognes  --  cases of champagne , pretty blonde mistresses , a pet lion cub that Wendy got to play with . Pretending to be entranced by her school-girl French , they gave her the Cook 's tour of the aerodrome , hoisting her into the cockpit of a high-compression Spad to feel the controls , escorting her through the hangars , explaining the workings of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking what they were for . Her guides assured her they were for " Le Boche . " They pantomimed pulling the pins and the bombs exploding . Wendy nodded . " Pour le Boche . " <p> Right on schedule Ryan arrived . He had come to show Les Cigognes what an SE5 looked like , so the Storks would n't shoot them down by mistake . While the men inspected the British fighter- running its engine and shouting comments  --  Wendy picked up her bag and walked casually back to the hangar . Opening her valise , she stuffed four of the small bombs inside it , cushioning them with a change of underwear . She was back on the flight line before anyone missed her  --  thinking how if she had taken Mum 's advice , and gone into munitions work , she would never have needed to be so devious . <p> The Storks wanted more than a look at the SE5 , so a mock tournament was arranged , with Wendy as fair lady . Ryan got her scarf . Guynemeyer , the ailing star of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three personalized Spad fighters , to be matched against Ryan in the SE5 . Frail as glass on the ground , Guynemeyer was an absolutely nerveless flier , with the cold hard eyes of a corpse-fly . Wendy saw her brave knight bested a dozen different ways . The Frenchman 's Spad was all over the SE5 , above , below , and on its tail . There was no way that Ryan could have ever gotten a shot off . When it was over , Ryan shook Guynemeyer 's thin white hand , and returned the wipe to Wendy , saying " Lass , I never claimed to be the best . " It was a delight to see him all the same , lunching on sweet wine and sugar cakes in the French mess . <p> Weeks later , back in London , Wendy read that Guynemeyer was dead , shot down in flames over Poelcapelle . Just like Ryan 's Rumpler . It was sobering to know that being the best was not near good enough . <p> Her next letter from Ryan did not come from France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off in a shot , without checking on visiting hours . The hospital confirmed her view of wartime nursing being cram full of the war 's wrecks and rejects , stitched up boys too badly maimed or blinded to be of use  --  if they were aircraft they would have been broken up for spares . Since they were n't aircraft they were filed away in a big building watched over by underpaid women and offensively chipper young doctors . A useless exercise that Wendy was well glad to be clear of . Expecting to find Ryan flat on his back , looking like a day-old corpse , she was cheered to see him in prime spirits , sitting between clean sheets  --  fed , bathed , and flirting with the nurses , who claimed he had been the perfect patient . " Did n't ask for his Mum more than once an hour . " <p> Wendy shook her head . " Good old Hun did it again ? " <p> " Righto , he got me another leave . " Ryan reached down and patted his leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't have placed the bullet better myself . " <p> Now that she saw he was going to live , she felt free to sit down and cry , shocked at how much she had come to love him . <p> " Here , here . " He took her hand . " Come , stop crying . ' T is the bunion on my good foot that hurts the worst . " Ryan did his best to be breezy and charming , full of that refuse- to-grow-up boyishness she so loved in Peter . Not fit to be turned loose in a drawing room , but a sure friend and would-be protector  --  all set to be her beau sabreur . Lifting his bandages he showed off the red puckered mark the bullet had put in his leg . " All my own fault , really . Tangled with an Albatros two-seater over Passchendaele . The Hun was poking along , taking his pictures , being a friend to the world . I thought I 'd bag him . You know , boost my record  --  Heaven knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He assured her other chaps were doing far worse . " Did I tell you Rhys-Davids is dead ? " Wendy shook her head . " And Cecil Lewis was jumped by one of the new Pfaltz scouts  --  shot in the back and nearly spun in . They got him working Home Defense . Squadron 's not what she used to be in the old days back at Bekesbourne . " By that he meant three months before . <p> As soon as Ryan was up and limping , showing a bit of his old bounce , Wendy begged him to take her flying . At first he was aghast . " Not for a colonel 's commission an ' a cup o ' tea . " But she worked him around to where he consented , " weather permitting . " He got the use of a BE2d attached to a flying school . " Told them I was keen to keep my hand in  --  frightfully eager to get back at the Hun  --  bloody idiots believe anything from a sod who sounds anxious to fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old BE2c , twice as ungainly , with greater range and a gravity tank . Ryan stored it in a small shed , where Wendy could get in the front cockpit and slump down without being seen . He would open the doors and get someone to swing the prop , or swing it himself while Wendy kept the throttle from opening too far . Then it was taxi out and take off . Right away Wendy was doing vertical turns , stalls , loops , spins , and split-arse spirals . All that flying in Neverland had made her a natural pilot . Ryan called it uncanny . " Normally a BE2 lumbers like a busted lorry . Never seen a student put the old trot through her paces so neatly . " <p> Wendy shrugged modestly . " Angel is my middle name . " <p> " Right . Well , do n't let anyone catch you at it , " he warned . " The RFC will put you in pants and hustle you into combat . " <p> " Oh , I doubt that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " War in the air was going as bad as always . At mid-month Zeppelins had stalked the Midlands , scattering bombs from Hull to Sheffield . Now the October moon was getting full again . Bombers hung off the coast . <p> But Ryan 's warning did not stop Wendy from showing up in a flying suit for the flight school 's Halloween dance . Ryan came dressed as the Red Baron , full of his customary impertinence , with a cardboard and tinsel Pour le Merite around his neck . The dance was held in an open hangar , under a big full Halloween moon . But it broke up early as the London defenses banged into action  --  firing at Gothas trying to get in . The flight school CO came around , silencing the band , saying the party was done with . Ryan asked who put the wasp in his pants . " Why ca n't we keep at it ? Dancing 's not going to draw bombers . " <p> The CO fixed him with a constipated glare . " ' Fraid it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Camps around Canterbury . More bombers are crossing the coast between Harwich and Southend . Could hit here anytime . " <p> Wendy pulled Ryan aside . " Do you love me ? " <p> " Of course , lass . Terrific time to ask . " Ryan was still royally pissed at the CO . He slipped an arm around her . " I 've not been riskin ' life an ' reputation all for the thrill of seeing you fly . I mean to parlay this game leg into a cushy billet , tourin ' lady 's clubs , tellin ' tall tales of combat  --  never gettin ' closer ta France than Brighton . Then after the War . . . " After the War was the pilot 's pat line . <p> She reminded him there might be no after the war . " So say you love me now . " <p> " Yes I love you . Ye forward hussy . " He kissed her and came away smiling . " So let 's go somewhere private an ' compare birthmarks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got too much to do in the morning . " She let him kiss her again . A long lingering kiss that took total possession of her mouth . <p> When the couples were gone , and the bomber 's moon filled the sky , Wendy stole back across the field , soft-footed as she could , still in her flight suit . Her time was now . Not one to procrastinate or play-act , she did not mean to wait about , like she waited for Peter , trying vainly not to grow up . Opening the shed gates , she slung her valise full of stolen grenades into the BE 's front cockpit . She leaned in , cracked the throttle , then went to spin the big four-bladed prop . Never having done it before , she took several heaves getting the 90hp RAF inline to turn over . Its roar shattered the early morning silence . Racing around to get in the cockpit , she was nearly too late . As she pulled herself aboard , the BE2 gathered way , bouncing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set the throttle too bloody high . Luckily controls were in neutral , and the BE2 was " inherently stable . " Particularly when still on the ground . The aeroplane charged onto the dark field like an overeager racehorse  --  through the starting gate with her jockey half in the stirrup . Wendy managed to tumble headfirst into the front cockpit , working the rudder pedals with her hands , easing back on the throttle . The big plane turned to face the runway , rolling to a stop . Ready for takeoff . She scrambled into her seat , muttering , " Well begun is half done . " <p> After the wild taxi onto the field , her first solo takeoff was anticlimax . Throttle forward , get her rolling . Forward elevator . Wendy felt the tail go up , and eased farther back on the stick . Wheels up . She was airborne . <p> And blind as a bat . The huge round Halloween moon threw precious little light into the cockpit , which was not lit for night flight . She sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no indication of air speed , engine revs , or oil pressure . She was fairly confident she could fly by feel - but what if something went out ? Well , if it did , she was sure to know . Even worse , she could not see her compass . How was she going to find the Gotha fields in Belgium with no bloody compass ? Would n't do to dump her French grenades on Sheerness , or Switzerland . <p> She pulled back on the stick , climbing toward the full blue bomber 's moon . There were patchy clouds over Essex . Once clear of them she could see the biggest compass of all  --  the great inverted bowl of the sky , blue-black and studded with stars . Putting the Dippers over her left shoulder she headed south and east toward the channel , and Flanders . <p> London hove to on her right , a vast dark mass crouching behind her defenses . No blackout could hide Europe 's largest city . She saw gunflashes over the East End , and a big blazing fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing tip , Wendy searched for the shining ribbon of the Thames , knowing she could follow the broad river down to the sea . <p> Without warning , ghostly lines appeared in front of her , hanging from huge swaying shapes . A balloon apron . Wendy swerved , dodging the dangling steel cables . Without a compass course , she had cut her angles too close , brushing the inner defense ring . Searchlights winked on . A shell burst beside her with a bang you could have heard in Scotland . Someone below had heard her engine . More shells exploded  --  weird faerie shapes , full of smoke and singing steel . Gunners were throwing up a barrage to bring her down . <p> Wendy cut her telltale engine and dived , banking left . She headed east toward the fighter patrol lines  --  a wide gun-free zone prowled by night fighters from Hainault , Sutton 's Farm , and Biggin Hill . She tried to remember everything Ryan had told her about the fighter lines  --  set patrols at standard heights of 10 , 000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Good Old BE2 could barely touch 10,000 . She 'd pass under them . Nothing to worry about until she got to the Green Line . Alone in her black cockpit she had to laugh  --  bent on bombing the Germans , her biggest problem was escaping London defenses . Trying not to get shot down before she started . " Peter . Tink . Are you there ? We could use a hand here . " <p> No answer . <p> " Well , gift , we 'll just have to go it alone . " <p> Lighted aerodromes guarding the city formed a glittering ring . Flying on , she did not know she had crossed the Green Line until a searchlight beam swept over her . The beam whipped back , pinning her plane to the night sky . Wendy sideslipped . More searchlights converged , trapping her in a cage of light . Guns opened up , blowing big smoky holes in the night sky . Wendy cut her engine again , pushing the stick forward into a screeching dive . Wind sang in the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine shook . Blinded by the lights , she screamed  --  " Do n't kill me , you bastards . I 'm British . " <p> As she burst through the outer ring firing stopped . Pulling out of the dive , Wendy glided silently over Kent , leaving the flack and searchlights behind . Below lay a new landscape , softly moonlit , cut by pale roads and dark hedgelines . Rooftops shone above lighted windows . She passed over a train that snaked along following two glittering tracks , throwing up a great feathery plume of smoke . Michael might be the driver . Forget following the Thames . She was not going back into that hell of guns and lights . Restarting her engine , she climbed , parting the clouds . The stars grew closer . Light from the big friendly bomber 's moon bathed the wings and fuselage , turning the BE2 into a ghost ship . <p> Without clock or instruments the flight became timeless , like her first trip to Neverland . Ahead she saw the black shape of a steamer , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way to Neverland lay over the water . " Second star to the right , and straight on till morning " was what Peter had told her , but he said whatever popped into his brainless head . <p> " Peter , you said you would come for me . " <p> No answer , just the throb of the engine . <p> She banked , putting the North Star off her left wingtip , pointing the BE 's nose toward morning . Dark air streamed past . Sea turned to land . In the distance Wendy made out a thin silver of light . First light already ? She was amazed . Dawn ought to be a ways off . How much time and fuel had she used up , dodging balloon cables and searchlights ? She meant to be deep in Hunland before the sun was up . <p> Flying straight for the red glow , Wendy watched the shining spread in both directions , separating into ten thousand pinpricks of light . It was not dawn at all . It was the front . A " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire rayed the trenches , bathing Flanders in a ghastly manmade glow visible from two miles up . Night turned into day by magnesium and cordite  --  a sickly reminder of what business Wendy was about . <p> The smoky glare of the guns passed beneath her . Wendy was over Hunland , occupied Belgium . All she needed was to find an aerodrome , hopefully a bomber base  --  drop her bombs  --  then head home . " Easy enough . " Only here aerodromes were n't lit up like Hainault and Biggin Hill . A morning fog was rising making it impossible to just fly low and look about . She had expected this bit to be titchy . Ryan told her the Gotha bases were well back from the lines . The farther she went , the better her chance of pouncing on a bomber base at first light , but she would have the Devil 's own time getting back  --  unarmed and low on fuel . Wendy had not brought a machine gun , a noisy nuisance that should never have been invented . The added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage that much worse . She cut the engine and let the ship glide , to save fuel and think clearly . Black velvety silence descended , turning her into a noiseless wraith , an avenging angel , silent and invisible . The false dawn of the front faded behind her . Fog thickened below . <p> Halloween night was past . It was All Saints Day , when the gates between the worlds open and the dead mix with the living . A bright star shone in the East . Wendy thought it might be Venus  --  but it came toward her , growing bigger , until it was about the size of her fist . <p> The fist-sized spark lighted on her stopped propeller blade , danced along the engine nacelle , and came to rest on the windscreen . At the center of the glow sat a pretty well-rounded girl , no larger than Wendy 's hand , wearing a square low-cut leaf . <p> " Tink ! Tink ! After all this time . " Tears shone on Wendy 's face . High over Belgium she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Tink answered in a burst of chimes , " Silly ass . " <p> " Tink , guide me . You 'll do it wo n't you ? " <p> The faerie did not reply . Instead she rose , whipped through the maze of wires and darted off , ahead and to the right . Wendy gunned her engine and banked fight . She knew Tink would take her there . Tink hated her passionately . In Neverland Tink had led her right into an ambush  --  only an acorn button saved Wendy from an arrow in the heart . If there was a Gotha 's nest ahead , bristling with guns , Tink would lead her to it . <p> Dawn , real dawn , showed in the east . On the outskirts of Ghent the faerie dived down into the fog . Wendy cut her engine and followed . The light in the east was not nearly enough to penetrate the night and fog over Ghent . She kept her nose pointed at Tink 's glow , wondering if the faerie meant to lead her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low meanness even from Tink ; she looked for a more subtle betrayal . <p> More faerie lights appeared . Two pairs , one on each side of Tink . Surprised by faeries flying in formation over Ghent , Wendy eased back on the stick , slowing her dive . She cut her engine and listened . That small hesitation saved her . From out of the fog came the double roar of engines . A giant tail marked with black crosses reared in front of her . Sideslipping frantically , she kept from stalling out , nearly gliding into the Gotha . What she thought were faeries were the glowing exhaust stubs of paired Mercedes engines . <p> Wendy heard Tink laugh . More Gothas were circling above and below , propellers churning through the murk , their familiar Wong-wong filling the fog . Ahead she saw searchlights , not beating about like over London , but standing straight up , marking the limits of a runway . She had barged straight into the landing pattern at a bomber base . Instantly she gave the BE full throttle , shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a plane bursting out of nowhere . Roaring through the landing pattern , she grabbed up the grenades she had stolen from the Storks . With nothing to aim at but the searchlight beams , she sideslipped , pulling the pins and hurling the grenades one by one at the vertical columns of light . <p> " That 's for the infant class , " she called out smugly . <p> Wendy doubted anyone heard her , or that the grenades hit their targets  --  but the effect was magical . Searchlights winked out . Machine guns stuttered below her . German 77s began to bang wildly into the fog proving Hun gunners were as flack happy as their British rivals . As she pulled up a Gotha sailed past , one engine afire , weaving frantically through the flack . Dodging the bomber , she climbed out of the witch 's cauldron , into the upper air . Whatever went on below , Wendy had done her best . <p> Putting dawn at her back , she headed for home , drained and exhilarated . Going flat out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawnlight filled the cockpit , and she saw she was dangerously low on fuel  --  still she had to push for altitude , taking up time and gas . Flying low over the front would be begging for a bullet . Too many keyed-up gunners crouched in the trenches , pounded by artillery and aching to shoot back . <p> Tink fluttered back and forth , doing **27;577;TOOLONG . <p> " Can you spare some pixie dust ? We may need it . " <p> Tink chimed back , " Silly ass . " <p> Every half minute Wendy would glance over her shoulder , into the blinding glare of an angry sun , imagining black specks dosing in behind her  --  " Beware of the Hun in the sun . " But she saw nothing . Half an hour and she would be across the lines . Clear and free . <p> Despite constant effort , Wendy never saw the hunter coming . One moment the sky was clear as new blown glass . The next moment it was filled with the mad stutter of twin Spandau machine guns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipped by her wing , leaving lines of smoke like paper party streamers . Horrified , she searched frantically over her shoulder . All she saw was the white evil-eye of the sun . <p> Another stutter . More zinging tracers brought Wendy up sharp . She did a violent skid to port . A black machine hurtled past , with rounded wingtips , a sharp nose and shark-like body . A jet-black Albatros with white crosses . The Hun , fooled by the lumbering pace of the BE , had overshot . If Wendy had a gun she 'd have gotten a good clean whack at him  --  but she was totally unarmed . Even her grenades were gone . <p> Taking the measure of his victim , the killer did a slow Immelmann , a half-loop half-roll  --  full of lazy contempt . He had her helpless . Terrified , sweating in her flight suit , Wendy watched him curve above her . Sunlight played on his wings . The black bird of prey could outrun , out turn , and out climb her . " Inherent stability " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , Peter . What can I do ? " <p> No answer . At the top of his arc the Hun nosed down to bring his guns to bear . Wendy had only one trick in hand . She jerked back on the stick , standing the BE2d on its tail , cutting the engine , bringing herself to a stop in the air . <p> Tracers zipped by  --  red hot rivets trailing smoke , short and to the right . <p> Before the Hun could correct she kicked her rudder over , falling off to the left , into a flat spin whirling like a dead leaf . Sky spun around her . Sunlight flashed through the cockpit . Wendy kept her gaze pinned to her altimeter . Feet ticked away . . . 6,000 5,000 4,000 . . . No sense looking up to see what the Hun was doing . That would mean dizziness . Vertigo . Wendy needed desperately to think . She had a pair of poor choices . She could spin straight into the ground . Smash up . End it there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin . But if the Hun had a half-ounce of killer instinct he would be following her down , making sure she hit the mud . When she came out the bastard was bound to be waiting  --  7.62mm bullets would rip through her , tearing big bloody holes . Whirling right into the ground might be better . <p> Tears stung her eyes . Where was Peter ? If she fell , she always thought he would catch her . In her giddiness she heard him . <p> Hullo Wendy . <p> " Hullo Peter . " <p> Have you come to fly with me ? <p> " I 've forgotten how to fly . " <p> Then what are you doing here ? <p> What was she doing ? It was hopeless to tell Peter about the infant 's class . About her grand design . " I 'm fighting pirates , Peter . " <p> Hullo , what fun ! <p> Wing shadows whipped past . Three thousand feet . . .2,000 feet . . . Below 1,000 her altimeter was worthless . Wendy nosed down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instantly she heard the thwack of bullets hitting wings and fuselage , the ping of wires parting . The black Albatros hung on her tail firing merrily into her machine . She 'd had it now . No safety anywhere . A bullet-hole appeared in her windscreen , ringed by a web of broken glass . Sick with fear , she looked for a place to crash . <p> Bullets punctured the gravity feed tank , spraying gasoline over her goggles , onto the hot cylinder heads . Tearing off the goggles , she cut the engine . Too late . Gasoline burst into flame . Smoke shot back in her face , filling the cockpit . She could no longer see the ground , or where she was going . Her engine was a roaring grease and oil inferno . Fire in the air . The ultimate horror . She felt the heat through her gloves and flight boots - smelled the leather on her flying suit start to fry . Pulling her feet off the rudder , she scrambled up atop her seat , putting inches between her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , she clung to the cockpit rim . Wind whipped through the wires , threatening to hurtle her into space . <p> The shooting had stopped . A tiny comfort . She was headed for a crash with her engine afire . Choking on smoke , she straddled the burning cockpit , changing hands on the stick to keep her gloves from catching fire . What could she do ? Peter . Tink . Where are you ? What had Ryan told her ? She remembered his story of the Rumpler pilot who jumped to keep from burning . A ghastly choice . Death either way . The man in the rear cockpit had ridden the burning two-seater into the ground . <p> Of course . It hit her like a brick . Rear cockpit . The Good Old BE had dual controls . She scrambled back over the rear windscreen , sitting in the instructor 's seat , seizing the second stick and rudder . <p> She sideslipped , to blow the smoke away . Able to see again , she looked for a flat spot to crash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , she flattened out , slowing her fall , trying not to fan the flames . Smoke poured from the front cockpit in a great gray plume . Steady , do n't stall . Plowed field flashed under her wings . Ease her down  --  do n't fly into the ground . That 's it . Brown furrows rose to meet her . Wheels touched . Bounce . Bang . Now a wingtip . Ground loop . Oh God , over we go . <p> Almost a landing , not quite a crash . One you could crawl away from . Wendy looked up and saw the black Albatros flash past her , plowing nose first into the field just ahead  --  making a much worse job of it . She scrambled out of the cockpit and watched her Good Old BE2 burn . <p> The Albatros did not burn . Nor did its pilot get out . The fighter just stood nose down in the plowed earth , its big rounded tail pointed at heaven . Wendy walked curiously over . The German pilot was slumped against his instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blood . The red gash in his throat made hideous gargling sounds . <p> A wild , cocky crow rang in the air , echoing in Wendy 's ears  --  Peter 's victory call . <p> German shock troops came running up waving their Mausers . She turned to face the rifles , spreading her hands apologetically . " I 'm afraid he is dead . " <p> The shock troopers hardly knew what to make of her after they washed the soot from her face and found she was a woman . Wendy was half sure they would just shoot her , the way they shot Nurse Cavell . Two weeks before the French had marched the Dutch dancer Mata-Hari out onto a Vincennes parade ground and shot her dead . But since Wendy was wearing a pilot 's uniform the troopers merely took her to the nearest aerodrome , the Gotha base at St. Denis . There she had the satisfaction of seeing four newly wrecked Gothas that had come down in the fog , victims of botched landings and German ground fire . Four grenades , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also handed over the pilot 's papers and the Pour le Merite he had worn around his neck . The ribbon supporting the iron cross was soaked with blood . Asked for an explanation , a trooper shrugged and drew his thumb across his throat . How an expert pilot could get his throat cut in midair was a mystery to this simple foot soldier . But one sees so many strange things in wartime . <p> Wendy knew , but said nothing . The Huns thought her mad enough already . <p> The men of the England Geschwader , whose main business was to bomb London , were totally mystified by Wendy  --  but delighted nonetheless . Any woman who would fly a toothless old biplane forty miles over enemy lines , for whatever reason , had their instant respect . Particularly if she was young and pretty . They toasted her with captured champagne and a boy with a beautiful baritone got up to sing " Tipperary " and " God Save the King . " Afterward the squadron commander drove her to the border , handing her over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a halting speech in broken English , explaining that German fliers did not make war on women . <p> Not if they are above the age of five , thought Wendy , but she let him have his say . She had done what she came to do . <p> Nervous about their neutrality , the Dutch put her on a boat to Norway . In Bergen she caught a convoy back to England . With four downed Got has to her credit , and that black Albatros ( which she had shared with Peter ) - Wendy was an ace , alongside Guynemeyer , Ryan Donnelly , and the Bloody Red Baron . But she was determined to retire . The RFC would have to soldier on without her . Lot they cared . <p> In little more than a year , to everyone 's vast surprise the war was done with  --  and the England Geschwader abolished , along with the whole German Air Force . The Bloody RFC was already gone , absorbed into the new Royal Air Force . Wendy and Ryan were married , he in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink sash .
