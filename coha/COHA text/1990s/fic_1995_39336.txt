In the summer of 1979 , Skylab , the first and only manned American space laboratory , malfunctioned and crashed to earth . NASA scientists calculated that most of its pieces would fall in the Asian Pacific region . Filipino mystics predicted that the biggest chunks would hit Manila . The Philippine government mobilized disaster teams , and the education secretary suspended all classes , announcing , " We can not cell what the heavens will do . We must trust in God . " <p> A devoted fortune-teller follows a set of daily rituals and abides by certain rules , not only to fortify himself but to give strength to people who seek his guidance . Like a samurai , he greets each day with humility and gratitude , says a quiet prayer for its generosity of light , and remembers that one day he , like the sun , will die . Like a Buddha , he keeps his necessities to a minimum : clean clothes and a simple breakfast , enough to last him through the strenuous ordeal of a reading . Like the Jain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and maintains a reverence for all living things : he does not disturb the universe . And like Christ , he must always feel love for all people , more so for those who can not love him in return . <p> It 's not the easiest thing to do , and so understandably there are a lot of fortune-tellers who merely go through the motions , especially in Manila , where practically everybody professes to be psychic to some degree . But Manila has always been a hard place in which to save the soul . <p> LESSON ONE : You Ca n't Tell Everybody Everything . Reading someone 's fortune is like playing poker : you 've got something on somebody but you keep the crucial parts to yourself . Nobody wants bad news . People need to be told how great they are , how wonderful life 's going to be despite current setbacks . And you must add a good deal of encouragement as well : be brave , be strong , for the future is in your hands . There is no dishonesty here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change is the only constant in the universe . The clients walk away happy , their lives renewed by hope , and you stuff the cards back in the box with a stranger 's darkness hidden in you like mortal sin . At the end of the day , the fortune-teller sits in meditation and expels all the bad karma he has absorbed from his readings , and after this ritual of exorcism he listens to a Beethoven symphony , or any other favorite music , and sleeps peacefully , hearing only his own concerns . <p> LESSON TWO : You Learn from Every Encounter . You have to , or there 's no point in doing it at all . This morning Mrs. Cruz came in for the third time this week with the same set of questions as always and the same troubled look on her face . She was very cheery at first , asking me questions so vague that the cards could give me no answers . I tried to amuse her by reading her palm and then offering to make tea , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked two mornings before . <p> Mrs. Cruz , I said , we already know what the answer is . <p> I was n't concentrating that time , she protested . I have n't been sleeping well . <p> I laid the cards on the table , many of them the same ones we had read during her previous sessions . This did n't surprise me at all . In most readings a person who asks the same questions twice gets variations of the same answer , with a bit of a reprimand for good measure . My mind often goes blank with the really persistent clients , and the cards that turn up make no sense . I was hoping I would n't go blank on Mrs. Cruz . She needed a great deal of help . <p> I lifted the King of Pentacles . There he is again , Mrs. Cruz , I said . Your husband has made up his mind . You can get the annulment if you like . He 'll give you the house and some money to live on . You 'll have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 've got a lot of things going for you . <p> And the girl ? she asked . <p> I tapped a finger on the Lovers . <p> It could be me , she said . <p> No , Mrs. Cruz , I told her . It 's not you . <p> I 'll go dancing , she said . Ballet . I want to study ballet . Do you think I should study ballet ? <p> I told her she might find the experience interesting . Mrs. Cruz was forty-nine years old . <p> Aerobics , she said . <p> Bravo , Mrs. Cruz . That 's how you do it . And , as usual , she heaved a sigh , pressed a few bills in my hand , and I protested strongly and gave them back . She seemed satisfied with the reading , for the moment at least , and we drank some tea . When she left , she dropped the bills , surreptitiously , reverently , on the table beside my censer . <p> Always they ask about love . Love and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I know it too well . The acrobat sets his foot on the tightrope but looks straight on , feeling only the roughness scrape his slippered feet . He does n't know if there is anybody down below watching him  --  everything is enveloped in darkness , and all he sees is the shaft of pale light beamed at him . But it does n't matter . He moves on , slipping one foot before the other , each time catching the outline of the rope  --  the feel of it  --  on the arch of his foot . Halfway across he imagines he is walking in space , an angel . He is exhilarated , then terrified . He falters , tilts to one side , flaps his arms , then traces an arc as he falls to the net below . Only there is no net . And his descent is interminable : there is no ground to break his fall . <p> Next come the minor concerns : work and money , and then health . But always it is love that afflicts these dislocated souls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they can confide their torment . They do n't even want to know what will become of their love , because in their minds all love leads to darkness , and the inevitability of it stokes the embers and transforms the beloved into an obsession . No , they want nothing more than the verbalization of their tenuous state . They watch their torment unfold before them as I lay out the cards , and their eyes , kept low and fixed on my hand as I turn up each card from the pack , seem to say , Yes , that is so . That is the source of my malady . <p> LESSON THREE : Desire Is the Cause of Suffering . Conversely , the Groundwork of All Faith Is Human Woe . But I do n't tell them that . The diagnosis itself is what they seek , as though by mere confirmation they draw one more soul into the conspiracy , and the shared secret is what fortifies them  --  for another minute , another day . <p> This afternoon , right on schedule , Marta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chico and took out three pieces of the small , brown fruit for me . I 've been having this craving , she said . You were right , she added , it 's been there a month . I went to a doctor after my reading and he said the same thing . She sat down heavily on the chair across my table . <p> Is it a boy or a girl ? she asked me . <p> A boy , I told her . No , a girl . No , wait  --  a boy . <p> Maybe they 're twins , she said . <p> Unico hijo , I told her . Only child . <p> I laid out the cards and did n't ask her for questions . There are some people who wear their concerns on their faces , a helpless , resigned look , and Marta 's was transparent . I told her to watch her health , stop smoking , and talk to her boss about going on leave . <p> A vacation ? she asked . <p> Hospital , I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . <p> Do n't worry , I reassured her . You 'll both be fine . <p> I fished out the Knight of Cups from the pack . He 's offering me something , Marta said , pointing at the proffered cup . She had become conversant in the symbols of the deck , thanks to frequent consultations . <p> You 'll be all right , I told her . <p> He 's running away , is n't he ? <p> I 'm sorry , I said . But you 'll be all right . Look , new people are coming into your life . This one with a gift ( I do n't know what ) . And this one with a vow to protect you . <p> But why the card of Death ? she asked me . <p> A time of renewal , I told her . <p> Do n't let it frighten you . It 's a very auspicious card . <p> She took out one chico from the bag and a steak knife from her purse and began peeling the fruit . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got up and brought her a box of Kleenex . You have a marvelous gift , Marta , I told her . The gift of life within you . What a positively marvelous gift . <p> I feel terrible , she said . Like something 's churning inside me . Like something 's eating my insides . <p> That 's because you 're feeding two people now , I told her . Did n't your doctor tell you that ? <p> I lied , she said . I did n't go to a doctor . <p> You should , I said . I 'm not an obstetrician . I ca n't tell you what to do . <p> Yes , you can , she said . Maybe you can deliver it right here . <p> No , Marta . <p> Why not ? <p> I ca n't stand the sight of blood . <p> She let out a laugh . Or rather a strange gasp that sounded like a cough , which she expelled into a Kleenex . She got up and hugged me with her free arm . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people need only the slightest token of affection to bolster them . I 'll be back , she said . <p> As often as you like , I told her . <p> She slipped a fifty-peso bill in my shirt pocket . I took it out and handed it back to her . No , Marta , you go to a doctor . Right now . Then I 'll take your money . <p> What if I run out ? she said . <p> Then I 'll take the baby , I said . <p> She laughed again , the same stifled cough . <p> LESSON FOUR : Keep Your Head Above Water . It 's all very nice to think you 've got a direct line to the celestial sphere , as long as you do n't let it go to your head . This is not the millennium for saviors , and anybody who thinks it is winds up lacing Kool-Aid in Guyana . And the times are even more demanding now , because everybody , everywhere , has to believe in something , just as the shipwrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , all the hollow idols floating in a sea of hope . <p> And so fortune-tellers who take themselves seriously have to train themselves not to take themselves seriously . Case in point : all those bejeweled matrons who have begun taking crash courses in mind power and who are now lining up to give celestial advice to the First Lady . I say , with all due respect , that they should all be banished to the infernal kitchen . Why ? Because they believe that for three thousand pesos they can stop the world . A good mystic must always show respect for physical law . <p> LESSON FIVE : You 've Got to Know Your Limits . Sometime in the early Seventies , if I recall , mysticism stopped being an esoteric eccentricity and became a household word , a parlor game , a national dementia . Cabalistic covens in bookshops , seances in Grace Park , communities waiting for extraterrestrials in Banahaw and Laguna , saffron-robed space cadets chanting off-key ragas , Bible preachers loosely interpreting the Apocalypse in Luneta , faith healers in Sampaloc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the idea that the country was once the capital of Mu , that mythical continent said to have predated Atlantis . Mu : a nonsense expression uttered by Zen Buddhists to denote the impossibility of locating Nirvana . Madame Marcos thought there was a hole in the sky through which divine messages were transmitted to the minds of her starving constituents . Some Zen monk should have whacked her on the head . But we knew our limits , and we said nothing in those days . The world was on its feet , heaven was on our side ; we saw visions strange and foreboding , but we kept them to ourselves , because heaven blesses the meek . <p> I may sound as if I constantly contradict myself . Very often I do . A fortune-teller can not always profess to have mastered the art of locating the center , or of logic . I suppose only the great prophets were able to do that , and the rest of us have to toddle along in the search , each nurturing his own torment . <p> The final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just upstairs . He hobbled in painfully , supporting himself on a cane . I helped him to a chair , where he caught his breath for a few minutes . I brought him a glass of water . He took a sip , wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , and said , It 's working well . I think I 'm getting better every day . He looked at the glass in his hand and said , Or maybe it 's the water . Do you use holy water ? <p> It 's not the water , Mr. Torres , I told him . If you say you 're getting better , then you most certainly are . I laid out the cards before him . The Sun , the Moon . He did n't wait for me to interpret them . Sometimes Mr. Torres just came down for a chat . They 're raising the rent soon . Did you hear about that ? he asked me . <p> No , I said . How much are they raising it ? <p> Double , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't there a price ceiling or something ? <p> Mr. Torres laughed . Nobody follows that , boy , he said . <p> I ca n't afford double the rent , I said . <p> Then there 'll be two of us out in the streets , he said . Maybe you can put up a stall in Quiapo . <p> Too much competition , I told him . <p> Well , we do n't have to worry about that , he said . The city 's going to be bombed very soon . <p> What do you mean , bombed ? <p> Have n't you heard ? he said . Oh , I forgot . You do n't own a radio . You should get yourself a radio , boy . <p> What 's the news ? <p> A spaceship is going to fall on Manila , he said gravely . <p> Oh , I 've heard about that . Everybody at the corner store has been talking about it all week . It 's a space station , Mr. Torres . It 's called Skylab , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to fall ? he asked me . <p> The experts can tell you that , I told him , shuffling the cards . It does n't say here , I said . But it says , Take care of yourself , watch your diet . <p> Why should I watch my diet when we 're all going to be crushed to death ? Those experts you talk about say they have no idea where the damn thing 's going to fall . He heaved a prodigious sigh , leaned back , and said , All right , I 'm ready now . <p> I walked behind him and placed both hands a few inches above the top of his head . <p> I can feel it coming in , he said . Like a fire entering my spine . He closed his eyes . <p> You 're doing all right , I told him . Have you had a checkup recently ? <p> He opened his eyes and waved a hand dismissively . Bah , he said . Doctors do n't do me any good . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your forehead before going to bed , I told him . It 'll make you rest better . <p> He placed the vial in his pocket and said , What if we sleep through the crash ? <p> The space station ? I asked him . Well , if it 's falling anywhere near here , I 'll come and wake you up . <p> He struggled to get up and leaned on his cane . Wo n't do any good to run , he said , if the whole city 's going to get hit anyway . <p> We 'll find some place , I reassured him . <p> He hobbled out and I sat down to look at the cards again , and for some moments all I could hear was his cane tapping faintly among the shadows . <p> LESSON SIX : You Ca n't Live Apart from the World . People think of fortune-tellers as sage , stoic Brahmins who are impervious to human emotions or physical suffering . To be able to feel deep longing  --  for a plate of sisig or the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terror , to be troubled by lust when one is alone in the dead of night , to weep silently in a closed , dark room , to long for adventure in a foreign land , to want a good pair of pure cotton socks or a sweater of bright designs , to fail to decode the nuances of sexual seduction : these are privy to mortals only , not to people who supposedly are in tune with things divine . Fortune-telling , therefore , is a life of extreme solitude . The danger here is self-pity . You try to avoid it , but it seeps through in sly moments , which is why people are correct in thinking that a fortune-teller conducts a reading based partly on his own predicament and state of mind . <p> Mrs. Cruz comes in with the same set of questions , the same deep gash in her heart that needs to be sewn up with the thread of love . <p> Will he ever come back to his senses , come back to the love we 've nurtured twenty years ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest and most tenuous of emotions , it is as inexplicable as science , it happens out of a certain need in which whirl the demons of desire and adoration , it is illusory , it turns against itself like an animal bursting out of its cage . <p> Marta comes with a bag of Chico and a question she never asks : Who will watch over me in my hour of need ? <p> A lot of people , Marta , if only you 'd look around , but your emptiness is a black hole that swallows all light around it and collapses to a world still unexplored . <p> And Mr. Torres asks , Will I die , and will God take me ? <p> Of course He will , Mr. Torres . But whether God is up there on a throne being feted by a choir of angels or down in the bowels of the earth feeding on the souls of the dead , I do n't know . I only know that some things accept veneration but refuse logic . Listen to this story : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinguishable . God assumed the form of the serpent as a manifestation of His wholeness , encompassing both good and evil . When Adam and Eve succumbed to temptation , they gave in to God 's negative and therefore had to be banished , because God must forever purge Himself of His evil twin . He bequeathed this internal struggle to his creatures , that they themselves might undergo the magnificent trials endured by God . God 's legacy to man was the mortal sin of limited knowledge : that which prevents us from comprehending Him completely . <p> These thoughts go on and on . I write them down in a little notebook I keep beside my deck of cards , and people assume I am keeping track of their readings or taking down significant revelations . Only Mr. Torres knows what I 'm doing . I swear he 's become eerily psychic himself . One evening he asked , Have you thought about saving us from Skylab yet ? <p> No , Mr. Torres , I 've been concerned more with the problems of comprehending mortal sin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning I saw a man by the chapel selling Skylab prayer cards for five pesos each . <p> Ha , I said . <p> Ha , he mimicked me . People are making good money out there , and that 's all you say ? <p> What do you want me to do ? <p> I do n't know , he said , scratching his head . Is there a way anyone can stop it from falling , or from falling all over Manila ? <p> Are you scared ? I asked him . <p> Scared enough to pee in my pants , he said . And a lot of people are , too . You 've been reading the papers ? <p> I said no . <p> Read the papers , he said . See what people are up to . Then wise men like you could probably think of a way to save us . You 've got to do it , you know . <p> Why ? I asked him . <p> Because nobody else will , he said . <p> The Skylab Watch Team , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers posted on the exact location of the wayward space station and the shifting coordinates of its impending crash . According to NASA , about five hundred pieces of debris , traveling at a maximum speed of four hundred kilometers per hour , were capable of causing injury . One or two film vaults or fuel tanks might be the size of refrigerators and weigh as much as automobiles . The area covered by the falling debris would be three times the size of the Philippines . Two weeks before the space station was predicted to crash , the Skylab Watch Team issued a reassuring announcement : Skylab would cause no radiation of any kind . The more immediate worry , it added , was the threat of widespread fires when it hit the city . Barangay Disaster Brigades were organized to watch out for fires , and during the crucial forty-eight hours air transport would be halted if the watch team received warnings from NASA in Houston . <p> After these announcements came in , Mrs. Cruz brought a portable black-and-white TV for us to monitor the approaching apocalypse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to do before the crash and got the following answers : ( 1 ) get married , ( 2 ) buy life insurance , ( 3 ) go home to the province , ( 4 ) get a crash helmet , ( 5 ) wait for the junk and resell it , ( 6 ) stay indoors and play mah-jongg , and ( 7 ) renew their faith in God . <p> Mrs. Cruz dropped in every day from then on , bringing food and asking me , every day , to plot Skylab 's coordinates with my deck of cards . As soon as the television arrived , Mr. Torres became a regular , immovable fixture . He had never owned a TV , and he sat as though mesmerized by an apparition , his pale face shining in the blue light of the screen . They both needed the reassurance of company , and a national crisis seemed to underline their loneliness . It was no more than that . Every evening I invited them to join me in meditation , which I prolonged for as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the daily news . <p> What I did n't tell them was that each time I read the cards they indicated that Skylab would hurl burning debris all over Manila . I shunted these readings from my mind ; for the first time I refused to believe anything the cards told me . I knew the contagion of hysteria was beginning to affect me . I spent hours in meditation , alone or with my visitors , enclosing myself in the blue egg of light mystics often prescribe for protection against unfavorable vibrations . I turned my mind off when Mrs. Cruz came in with the latest rumors about the crash or when Mr. Torres repeated predictions from the suddenly prescient newscasters . <p> One evening a week before the crash , I had a dream . I was floating in space , in an ocean of darkness . Suddenly I found all around me a hailstorm of burning-objects : coffee mugs , space helmets , a gyroscope , a radio receiver , a urinal , a flatiron , a birdcage , books with their pages flapping open , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a severed hand , a thermometer . They streaked all around me , falling to a tiny blue globe that looked like a hole of light . And then I saw the moon drifting behind them , a gray , pockmarked rock whirling slowly , sending up cyclones of khaki-colored dust . I floated straight toward it , and I found myself hovering over its corrugated surface . I was so close I could see the dry landscape spinning , vertically , from bottom to top like the sheet of a Pianola , and all I had to do was reach out and hook my fingers into its craters , like a bowling ball , to make it stop . <p> Before I knew it , people were streaming into the apartment to join our evening meditations . Mrs. Cruz brought in three of her friends , elderly matrons abandoned by lovers and children , seeking the comfort of companionship . They came in with boxes of Fastries , thermoses full of juice , and small talk . Mr. Torres , who had informed the local slackers , the stambays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattooed thugs who wanted to repent and turn over a new leaf . Marta , her belly now perceptibly swollen , stayed on after her usual readings and occasionally brought a girlfriend from the office . Each evening had the air of a village fiesta , with food and drinks all around and conversations going nowhere . <p> I must confess that I did n't mind this congregation at all , for purely practical reasons : since these people started coming in , there had been no need for me to worry about the next day 's meal or even the rent-Mrs . Cruz felt it was her moral obligation , being the most financially liquid of the people there , to shoulder my dues till the end of the month or kingdom come , whichever occurred first . And the dislocated denizens of my apartment continually dropped modest savings beside my censer , small tokens of appreciation for the comfort of my presence but which , at the end of the day , amounted to no slim pickings . It was n't a bad life  --  a bit crowded but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My little ashram gave comfort to those who needed it , and they made life in the material world easier for me . As I read further reports of Skylab 's impending crash , however , I became more and more convinced that all the hysteria running through the city was unfounded . Even my cards turned sympathetic , suggesting , at some point , that the space station would fall , just as NASA later predicted , somewhere near Australia . <p> I did try , several times , to tell these people that they were safe , that the whole city was safe , that they could go home and watch TV , watch Australia burn to cinders in the safety of their own living rooms . Perhaps I did n't try hard enough . Once I let them in on my dream of the moon and how I managed to hold it still . That further bolstered their confidence in my powers of salvation . And little by little I began to skew the readings a bit , telling them that the hour was near , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skylab may fall over Manila , I told them , and this apocalyptic hailstorm can be deflected by will alone . I almost started to believe it myself . <p> My motley constituency came in early on the eleventh of July , the day Skylab was predicted to fall . I woke up to the bustle of breakfast being prepared in the kitchen , with Mrs. Cruz supervising the chores . The smell of coffee was all over the place , and steaming rice hissed contentedly in a pot . Furniture  --  what little I had  --  was shoved aside to make room for meditation . The TV was on , blaring the news . I staggered downstairs groggily , greeting each one , and ignored requests for one final reading by turning my complete attention to a table laden with buttered an de sal . By mid-morning , more and more people had trickled in  --  friends of friends of friends  --  and the air in the apartment was getting sticky . We took turns chanting the whole day , the drone of our supplication vibrating out into the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , wanting to believe . And as the day wore on we attracted more people , some who had heard of our shelter , some I used to see occasionally on the street , and some who had little else to do but wait for the end of the world . In this crowded space we waited for the crash , and we were convinced that we could defer or cancel the event with nothing more than a mantra , a collective refusal . <p> Did I believe any of this ? I do n't know . In the back of my mind I was hoping for a patter of objects , as though someone were throwing stones on the roof ; a small fire somewhere , duly doused by the disaster brigades ; perhaps a crater in some godforsaken shantytown ; or a splash , brief and spectacular , in the Pacific Ocean . Indeed , I was almost tempted to initiate one of these myself , short of torching the entire neighborhood . And if Skylab fell over our heads ? We would all be dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would not be to blame . <p> We chanted . We prayed . We fell into deep silence as midnight approached , and no footage of the crash filtered through the blinking TV screen . I looked around at their faces : Mrs. Cruz , her eyes shut tight , spouting a mantra as loudly as she could ; Marta , in an armchair , her hands folded over her belly ; Mr. Torres , legs spread out on the floor , his back to the wall , his eyes fixed on the black rectangle framed by the window ; all the faces who had come in like stragglers from a skirmish , all the world 's walking wounded . <p> At the stroke of midnight it was Mr. Torres who got up first . He stretched his arms , gave a prodigious yawn , and waited for the others to stand up . People began to shift uncomfortably , hesitantly . I could feel some sense of disappointment in them , mostly from passersby who had expected a spectacular display of fireworks or something close to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had lost these people forever or , worse , that they felt cheated and were now seriously considering whether to tear me limb from limb . <p> And then something strange happened . One by one they filed toward me , and each one kissed my hand . No word was spoken . Mr. Torres patted me on the shoulder . Mrs. Cruz kissed me , wetly , on both cheeks . Each one walked out , back to the safety of his own lodging , into the secret world in which I , only I , was the last welcome guest . <p> Marta was the last to go . She rose heavily from her chair after everyone had gone , waddled over to me , kissed my hand as everybody else had , hugged me , and said , I felt him kick at that moment , exactly at midnight . Maybe I 'll call him Skylab . <p> Years later Marta sent me a card , saying she had found work abroad and was leaving soon , but she did n't say where . I moved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did Mr. Torres , with whom I completely lost touch . Mrs. Cruz hopped from one ashram to the next , got the house and her alimony , and lived comfortably , or at least I hope she did . <p> I 've stopped doing readings , mainly because age wears down even the sturdiest of mystics . Sometimes I wonder if I believed any of it at all . In later years I must have become less of a believer and more like that tiresome species you find in academia and at magazines and cocktail parties : the sophisticated skeptic . There are times when it all seems to come back , but often I see only a blank space , vast as the sky , which I fill with imagined constellations . One of these days I 'll probably buy a book and study the stars for real . It can be an interesting hobby , I 've been told . <p> LESSON SEVEN : You Never Know Where People Will End Up . <p> LESSON EIGHT : You Can Never Look Back . <p> Eric Gamanlinda is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
