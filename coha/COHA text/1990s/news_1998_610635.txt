<p> And so , once more , we are divided . Not by race this time , or by sex , or even income . This time it 's by cheese . <p> As we read on the front page of this paper last Tuesday , American Demographics magazine reports in this month 's issue that the Washington area is generally split in half , with the Brie belt fanning out from west and north of the District and the Velveeta loyalists dominating the District itself and good portions of Prince George 's County to the east and south . And , as staff writer D'Vera Cohn reported , that cheesy divide corresponds with other differences many of us recognize and feel . <p> But food , especially party food , can also bring people together . So we headed for the kitchen . Our goal : to devise party fare that would turn the tables on Velveeta and Brie , to make " snooty " Velveeta hors d'oeuvres and sinfully " tacky " Brie snacks . <p> Think about the two cheeses for a minute and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's classic recipes . Velveeta en croute would run right out of that hot , flaky pastry crust the instant you cut into it . Conversely , Brie would n't melt enough to embrace the salsa in a Chili con Queso Brie . And Velveeta 's blockiness works against the classic Brie presentation with walnuts and honey drizzled on top . <p> But each cheese ( or " process cheese spread " in the case of the Velveeta ) has its charms . And so do the hors d'oeuvre recipes that follow . <p> P.S. Velveeta lovers , do n't interpret that " process cheese spread " line as a slam . The industrially produced Brie cheeses from France sold in most markets are n't that many steps closer to the farm  --  technological tinkering does n't stop at the U.S. border . <p> BITE-SIZE GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES WITH BRIE AND APPLE SLICES <p> ( Makes 20 triangles ) <p> Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best . Here 's a perfect example  --  an easy-to-fix hors d'oeuvre that can be thrown together in 10 minutes . <p> 10 firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into very thin slices <p> 2 tart apples , peeled , quartered , cored and thinly sliced <p> 2 tablespoons salted butter <p> Lay 5 of the bread slices out on a clean surface . Cover each slice with a single layer of the Brie , trimming the cheese to fit the bread . Then cover with a single layer of apple slices and another layer of Brie . Top with the remaining bread to form 5 sandwiches . <p> Over low heat , melt the butter in a large saute pan or griddle . Transfer the sandwiches to the pan or griddle , in batches if necessary . Use a small plate or pot lid to lightly weight each sandwich down . With the heat still on low , brown the sandwiches on one side for about 4 minutes . Then remove the weights , carefully flip the sandwiches over , replace the weights and brown them on the other side . Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board . With a sharp knife , trim the crusts and cut each sandwich into quarters . Serve immediately . <p> Per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gm carbohydrates , 6 gm fat , 18 mg cholesterol , 4 gm saturated fat , 145 mg sodium <p> BRIE , WALNUT AND HONEY MINI-PIZZAS <p> ( Makes 25 mini-pizzas ) <p> The trick here is to shape the dough into nice rounds and then prebake them so the pizza dough will be cooked through by the end of the second baking . Once you get the hang of it , you can make up your own toppings . <p> 1 pound pizza dough* <p> 4 ounces Brie cheese , diced into 1/2-inch or smaller cubes <p> 1/3 cup chopped walnuts <p> 2 to 3 tablespoons honey <p> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees . Line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment , or spray with nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray . <p> Divide the dough into 25 pieces . Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten the balls by hand or with a rolling pin into circles about 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter . Place the circles on the prepared sheets and bake for 8 minutes to partially cook the dough . Let cool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dough circles . Sprinkle with the chopped walnuts and drizzle the honey over each circle . Bake until the Brie melts and starts to brown , about 12 minutes . Serve warm . <p> * NOTE : Fresh pizza dough can be found at Italian specialty stores . Supermarkets often carry frozen dough , as well as pizza-dough mixes and Pillsbury-brand refrigerated pizza dough .

Line a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable oil cooking spray . <p> Unfold one of the pastry sheets ( keeping the second sheet cold and wrapped in plastic ) and , using a rolling pin , lightly roll out to form an 11-by-11-inch square . Cut the square into 3 equal pieces vertically and horizontally , to form 9 small squares . Repeat with the remaining pastry sheet . <p> Working with one square at a time , lightly brush the edges all around with the beaten egg . Place a few cubes of the Velveeta cheese spread in the center and top with about 1/2 teaspoon of salsa . Form the square into a puff by joining the 4 corners of the square and carefully pressing and folding the edges together . Turn the puff over and place , seam-side down , on the prepared baking sheet . <p> Bake until puffy and golden-colored , about 20 to 25 minutes .

To determine if the oil is hot enough , drop a small cube of bread in it . If it starts to sizzle and turn golden , the oil is ready . <p> While the oil is heating , mix the risotto with the Velveeta cubes . Place the flour , eggs and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls and line them up in that order . Lightly wet your hands . Take a heaping tablespoon of the risotto mixture , shape it into a ball , roll in the flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread crumbs . Be sure to coat each ball thoroughly with the bread crumbs . Place on a clean surface and repeat with the remaining risotto . <p> Fry the risotto balls in the oil in batches , being careful not to crowd the pot , until they are nicely browned , about 8 minutes . After 3 minutes , use a spatula to loosen any balls that have stuck to the bottom ( some cheese may have escaped  --  do n't worry ) and to turn the balls over so they will all brown evenly . <p> Drain on paper towels .
