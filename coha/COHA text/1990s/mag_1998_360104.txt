Rapper-producer RZA has long enjoyed a reputation for being one of the most creative acts in hip-hop , and his new solo album lives up to his billing . A theme album , Bobby Digital looks at the exploits of a partially mechanized creature . As you might guess , given the B-movie setup , not all of the album makes sense , but RZA does create an atmosphere of sci-fi menace and scatological humor . The music is propelled by elastic rhythms and scattershot rapping . Several tracks are vulgar and misogynistic , but RZA tries to show his softer side with a hiccuping hip-hop cover of the soul song Love Jones . This is a fine album . Romance never seemed so raw . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
