The minstrel Alaric first graced these pages some twenty-seven years ago , in the August 1971 issue to be precise . Since then his exploits have been recounted in a story or nine and assembled into the books Born to Exile and In the Red Lord 's Reach . For the past decade we have n't seen much of him-Ms . Eisenstein began to teach fiction writing at Columbia College Chicago in 1989 and has been applying lots of her creative talents to her students . ( You can see the results in the Spec-Lit anthologies she has been editing recently-No. 2 has just been published . ) We 're happy to welcome back the bard with this tale of ghosts and magic and a poisonous lake ... <p> LONG AGO , IN THE MORNING of time , the people lived in a warm and green place , where the sun had cared for them since first they opened their eyes . And life was sweet in that place , in the care of that good and generous sun . But the people were wanderers in their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green place , and on that good sun , and set out into the Great Night to find another home . Their journey was long , for the darkness was vast , and homelands were as tiny and lost in it as flowers on the grassy plain . But the Pole Star had looked upon them in that darkness , and finding them worthy , he claimed them for his own , and guided them safe to this sun and this place . Yet when they came to their newhome , it was not a land such as they had known before . No , it was a land strange and beautiful a land where magic grew in every meadow , and flowed in every river , and breathed in the very wind . And foolishly , they destroyed that magic , and made the land over in the image of their old home , which they had left so far behind in the Great Night . And they were happy in their new home , not understanding what they had done . But the Pole Star , who loved them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hidden places , and laid a net of his own power over land and sea , that the magic might be protected and perpetuated , forever living . And the Pole Star gave the knowledge of that magic to those who chose to dwell in his own favored domain , to hold and to use to ease their hardships . For they are wanderers , as the people were once wanderers every one , and the Pole Star has claimed them before all others . And the sign of that gift is the promise of the sun - that no matter how great the night grows , there will always be a dawn . - Song of the World 's Beginning ( among the People of the North ) Alaric the minstrel paused at the crest of the hill . To his left and right , a line of hills stretched as far as the eye could see , but before him , to the west , the land sloped downward gently to a broad , flat plain . Upon that plain lay an irregular grid of ocher fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barley , wheat , and oats left to dry in the last warm days of the year . The two dozen dwellings of the peasants who worked those fields were clustered together into a village near the center of that grid ; Alaric could just make out their stone walls and thatched roofs , and the stone fences of the animal pens that flanked them . Farther on , much too far from the village to be a comfortable walk for fetching water , was the lake , shining like burnished silver under the autumn sun . The Lake of Death . The day had been hot , even so late in the year , and Alaric was stripped to the waist , his face shaded by the wide-brimmed hat he had plaited from the sparse wayside grass . Slung over one shoulder was his knapsack , with only a cloak and a shirt and some scraps of bread inside ; over the other was his lute , the minstrel 's boon companion . The strange and magical north lay far behind him- the great glacial waste , the lodestone mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls and of her elixir that healed the dying and could even raise the dead . Lately , he had moved through less exotic lands , through arid hills cloaked in scrub , their infrequent streams shallow and meandering over pebbly beds , their scattered inhabitants scrabbling to draw a living from the parched soil . Yet in those lands he had heard again and again of a bountiful plain beside a mirror-bright lake , a place where a strong lord ruled and enemies had never conquered . A place where the people used water from that lake as their weapon-water that killed what it touched . The first time he heard the tale , Alaric knew that a minstrel whose stock in trade was legend and wonders would be a fool to pass it by . He could have reached it earlier in the year . He could have used his witch 's power to leap from horizon to horizon , from village to village , tracking the place down in a matter of days . But he had walked instead , as an ordinary man would walk , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made folk strike out at what they feared . And he had walked , too , because he was in no great hurry to see what lay beyond the next hill as long as there were listeners for his songs before it . Barely nineteen summers old , he had lost everything in his life , or abandoned it , and now nothing called him to one place over another . Nothing but curiosity . The track he followed to the hilltop had been broad and rutted , but overgrown , as if little used in recent times . As it descended among the fields , though , it became a real road , cleared of weeds and graded smooth . It led directly to the village and on past , to the lake shore , where it became a stone causeway linking that shore with an island in the very center of the water . The island was a small one , and occupied entirely by a single building , a high-walled fortress with pennons flying from its many turrets - the fortress of the lord of the Lake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw two stocky , middle-aged men and a boy of nine or ten walking toward him . They were dark-haired and sun-browned , dressed in sleeveless gray tunics and breeches , and they strode fearlessly toward the stranger . Before they were near enough to ask his business , he halted , doffed his plaited hat , and bowed low . The lute slid from his shoulder , and he caught it with one curled arm and strummed a chord as he held it against his bare chest . " Greetings , good sirs ! " he called . " Alaric the minstrel , at your service with songs for every mood and every season ! " They halted a few steps away , and the men smiled , but the boy just stared at the lute , wide-eyed , as if it were some unknown animal . " A long time since a minstrel came this way , " said the shorter of the men ; he had the guttural accent Alaric had become accustomed to in these western lands . He laid an arm across the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alaric answered the man 's smile with his own . " So much the better for me . Thirsty folk drink deep and are usually kind to the water-bearer . " The man laughed then . " Well , I suppose there will be quite a few thirsty folk , when they discover that water has arrived . I hope your water is sweet , my friend . " " Always , " said Alaric . " We have both kinds of water here , " said the boy . " Sweet from the springs and bitter in the lake . " His father laughed again , and the other man joined him . " The child is a little young to understand figures of speech . But he tells the truth . And you should be warned - do n't try to drink the bitter water of our lake . It would ruin your voice , and the rest of you , forever . " " I 've heard something like that , " said Alaric . " Good , " said the man . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years . For it 's as true as it ever was . Anyone who touches that water , who so much as dips a hand in it , hardly has time to regret the act . " " And yet they say you toss it at your enemies . Can you avoid touching it yourselves when you do that ? " " We have pumps , " said the boy , " and special clothing . " His father shook his shoulder gently , as if to silence him . " We have been here a long time , minstrel , " he said . " We know how to live with the water in the Lake of Death . " Alaric glanced at the lake , at the island in its center . " I see that . " The man nodded . " My Lord Gazian lives there . Come now , minstrel . I am the headman of this village , and Taskol is my name . And these are my son Yosat and my brother Adeen . Come to our home and sing for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alaric grinned . " Then I look forward to a fine reward . But should I not pay my respects to Lord Gazian first of all ? " He gestured toward the fortress . " Oh , he 's a busy man . He would n't have time to hear a minstrel until much later in the day . You can sing for the village this afternoon and for him this evening . " And when Alaric still hesitated , he added , " I think you should prove yourself to lesser folk before being allowed to entertain such a great man , do n't you ? " Alaric strummed a chord on his lute , and then another . " Are you perhaps afraid he 'll keep me to himself and not let you listen if I go to his castle first ? " Taskol shrugged . " He is a man who likes the best of things . And he deserves them , of course , for he keeps us safe . But as headman , I must look out for my villagers , in my own small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wish to offend such a great man , " said Alaric . " I will escort you to him myself this evening , " said the headman . Alaric looked at him for a long moment . There had been trouble once or twice in his life over such matters of courtesy . Not so long ago , menat-arms had been sent to terrorize a peasant family that had kept Alaric from their lord for a single night . But looking at the village headman , at his son and his brother , Alaric saw no uneasiness , no sign of fear of the man who lived in the middle of the Lake of Death . " I would like to rest my legs a little before crossing that causeway , " he said at last . " Indeed you shall , " said Taskol . " I wager you 've walked a fair distance today . " Alaric nodded . " And some ale would not go amiss , would it ? " " Indeed it would not . " The headman 's hut was the largest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood rather than hard-tanned leather , though the wood was old and weathered . Inside , there was hardly any wood at all . Where settee and chairs might have stood in another household , this one offered stone stools and a stone bench , roughly shaped and thickly cushioned with straw mats . Even the bed in the corner had not the simplest wooden frame to raise it above the hard-packed earthen floor ; it was a mere straw pallet , though a thick one , draped with a woolen blanket . Of all the furniture , only the tabletop was made of wood , as weathered as the door , and resting on stone pillars instead of legs . And in the fireplace , dried dung smoldered beneath the big cookpot . There was plenty of straw and stone and dung around the Lake of Death , Alaric realized , but not a single tree . Taskol 's wife brought ale , and when the minstrel had quenched his thirst , he sat outdoors on another straw-cushioned stone bench and entertained the village with songs of the ice-choked Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearly a hundred listeners crowded the space beside the headman 's home , standing , sitting on the stone wall that penned his sheep and cows , squatting on the dusty ground - the whole of the village , Alaric guessed , from the eldest graybeard to the smallest babe in arms . He made them laugh first , with the tale of the herder boy who discovered that his deer could speak and was disbelieved until he revealed some of the embarrassing human secrets that the deer knew ; and then he made them gasp at the tale of the nomad who tried to save his people from starvation by hunting the huge and terrible Grandfather of All Bears . Afterward , when the crowd had dispersed with many an appreciative word , Taskol served him fresh bread and new butter and admitted that his skill was great enough for the lord of the Lake of Death . " But remind him , please , that we of the village like music , too , " he said . " So that he does not keep you entirely to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will do what I can , " he said between bites . " I suppose I must deliver you to him , then . If you are ready ... " " Is there bread like this on the island ? " asked the minstrel . " There is the best of everything on the island , " the headman replied . Alaric downed a last draft of ale to clear the butter from his throat , then drew the dark shirt from his knapsack and slipped it on . " I am ready . " The lake shore was a broad , barren margin , marked at the water 's very edge with a thick pale crust , like hardened foam . The causeway , made of fine , squared blocks of stone so white it dazzled the eye , began well before this crust and rose smoothly till , where it entered the water , it stood a man-height high above the surface . Broad enough to accommodate two wagons abreast , it ran arrow-straight to the island , broken by two gaps , each spanned by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortress was a third bridge , guarded by a spearman in bossed leather armor . Taskol identified Alaric to the man , and the two were admitted . Inside the gate was a courtyard large enough to hold half the houses in the village . " This is a strong citadel , " Alaric said , looking up at the high , crenelated walls . Only a handful of armed men stood at the crenelations , scanning the world beyond the lake . At any other castle , there would be dozens . " It 's given you safety for quite a long time , I would think . " " For my lifetime , and my grandfather 's , and more , " said Taskol . " No one living remembers the last time we had to lock ourselves inside these walls for a siege . Of course , the lake is our true defender . " " I would hate to fall off that causeway . " Taskol nodded . " So would I. " " Has anyone ? " " Not lately . " Alaric glanced over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently at the pure white sides of the raised stone road . " What would happen if someone did ? " " No one could save him . Within a few heartbeats , the flesh would begin to shred from his bones , and then the bones themselves would begin to dissolve . It 's an ugly sight . " Alaric shuddered . " You 've seen it ? " " When I was a child , we chased a fox off the causeway . It floated , for a short time , while the water worked on it . " He shook his head . " Poor hapless fox . Normally , animals stay away from the lake . They know what it holds . " Looking up at the walls again , the minstrel said , " How strange to live surrounded by ... that . " Then he smiled a slow smile . " I 'll make a song of it , if I can . " Taskol smiled back . " I think that would not displease my lord . " He pointed to the doorway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I imagine he awaits his dinner just now . If I introduce you , he might invite me to stay for the meal . " " By all means , then , introduce me . " The great hall of the keep was not so large as some Alaric had visited , but it was one of the most luxurious , at least at first glance . High , narrow windows admitted the afternoon sunlight , showing the walls hung with tapestries , the stone floor scattered with carpets and furniture of velvet and fine-carved wood . Only on closer inspection , as he walked the length of the chamber , did he see that the carpets were wom almost to their backings in many places , the tapestries were moth-eaten , the velvets thinnapped and shiny , and the fine woods dry and cracked . The riches of the citadel were of an earlier generation , and had not been renewed . He realized that more than a few seasons must have passed since that overgrown road had known much traffic . Yet there was newer wealth here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the room , ancient as it appeared , was heavy laden with fresh bread , meats , and vegetables , with butter , cheese , and ale . And the two men who sat behind it were dressed well enough , in supple leather , light wool , and golden chains . They looked like brothers , both dark and strong-jawed , though one was much older than the other . Taskol bent the knee before them , and Alaric imitated him . " My lord , " said Taskol , " I beg to present Alaric the minstrel , lately come into our land to offer his songs for our pleasure . " The older of the two men pushed his chair back and rose to his feet . " It has been long and long since a minstrel came to this land . You are welcome , sir . " But he said the words gravely , without any smile . He was a tall man , and broad with muscle , though his hair was touched with gray and there were deep lines carved about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " As you see , we are dining . Join us , minstrel , and afterward show us your wares . We would welcome something new . " He sat down again . Then he added , " Stay , too , Taskol . You threshed the grain that made this bread . " Taskol bowed . " I thank you , my lord . " He and the minstrel took places on a bench at one end of the table , and they ate well of the viands spread before them . From time to time , other leather-clad men entered the hall , made their obeisances , and sat to the meal , but none of them stayed long , and none of them wore gold . Alaric recognized one as the guard of the gate . Two young serving women cleared the table and set out more ale to signal the end of dinner . They eyed Alaric curiously but said nothing , only hurried off when they were done , to a door that stood at a corner of the hall , between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , but stayed in the open doorway , looking at him , and other men and women crowded there with them , half a dozen or more . The castle servants , Alaric thought , waiting for whatever novelty the stranger was about to provide . Lord Gazian waved at him to proceed . Pushing his bench away from the table , Alaric settled the lute on his lap . There was a song he had been working on for quite some time , and he thought it was ready for singing now-a tale of darkness for half the year and light for the rest , of blossoms growing from the very ice at the pole of the world and spawned by seeds fallen from above the sky , from whose leaves a curing elixir could be made . In the song , a young man fought storms and monsters and the Northern Sea itself to reach those blossoms , for his beloved lay ill , and not even the wisest healer knew another way to keep her from death . When he had won through and saved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse , the listeners at the doorway clapped their hands and chattered among themselves until their lord cast a single dark glance in their direction . " A well-sung song , " he said , " but I like not the subject matter . Sing of something real , minstrel . " Alaric almost said that the elixir was real enough , though the monsters were inventions , but he caught himself and bowed his head . He had no proof , just his word , and he had learned over the years that it was rarely healthy to contradict a nobleman , even with proof . He sang another song , a comic one of squabbling neighbors and stolen sheep , and of a man who was fooled into counting his sheep three times and reckoning a different number at each . Before he was done , the folk at the doorway were laughing , and even Lord Gazian himself had smiled a little . " You have much skill , " he said . " And your songs are ... interesting . You could make your fortune in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to these remote and sparsely peopled lands . " He sat forward , leaning his elbows on the table , the cup of ale between his hands . " What brings you to us , minstrel ? " Alaric bowed again . " Nothing , my lord , but a boundless desire to see the world and add to my stock of songs . Those songs are my fortune , and an easier one to carry than any gold . " The younger man spoke for the first time . " You are brave to come here , sir minstrel . Unless Taskol has not told you of the lake ... " He looked narrowly at the headman . " I had already heard , in far-distant places , and he told me as well , " said the minstrel . " But I think I am less brave than the folk who live here . I would not wish to try this lake during a storm , when the deadly waves splash high . " " These stout walls protect us , " said Lord Gazian . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since one of our own was claimed by the lake . " " Still , I see high courage in living here . You and your people have all my admiration . " " Enough admiration , " said the younger man . " Sing another song . " Gazian looked at his companion for a moment , and Alaric saw a flicker of anger pass between them before the lord of the castle turned back and said , " Go ahead , another song . " Another song led to another , and at last the sunlight in the high windows reddened and faded , and tripod oil lamps were lit to take its place . Finally , Alaric pleaded weariness after a long day of walking and said that he would sing again the next day , if desired . Lord Gazian nodded and rose abruptly from his place at the table . " You have our thanks , minstrel , for this afternoon 's entertainment . My brother will see that you are made comfortable for the night . " He nodded to the younger man and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tapestry-fringed archway in the farther wall . Stairs were visible beyond the arch , and in a moment , he had climbed out of sight . The younger man rose , when his brother had gone , and he came around the table to stand above the minstrel . " You sing well , young minstrel . What was your name ? " " Alaric , my lord . " The man 's mouth tightened for a moment . " I am not known as lord , " he said . Then he made a peremptory gesture toward the doorway that was still crowded with servants , and the two young women came scurrying . " Make him a pallet in the kitchen , " he said , and turned away . With a swift stride , he went out to the courtyard . Alaric glanced at Taskol . " Have I insulted him ? " he asked . Taskol shrugged . " Master Demirchi is the heir . But while his brother lives , there is only one lord here - we have n't room for more in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have thought to warn you . We call him sir . " " I will do that , then , and hope he forgives a stranger . Though I 've never before met a man who did n't like being addressed above his station . What would he have done if I had called him majesty ? " Taskol laughed and shook his head and led the way to the kitchen , while the serving women trailed behind . The kitchen was a small room , dominated by a great fireplace and crowded with worn trestle tables and deeply grooved butchers " blocks , with cauldrons and platters and roasting spits . It was also a warm room , but now that darkness had fallen and cool night air had begun to slide through the high windows of the keep , that warmth was pleasant enough . The kitchen servants made Alaric a pallet near the embers of the hearthfire , and they left a few choice tidbits from dinner on a table nearby , in case he woke hungry in the middle of the night . Taskol packed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to his family , before he bade Alaric good night . Then he and the servants put out the lamps and left the minstrel to sleep his first sleep surrounded by the Lake of Death . Alaric lay on his back for a time , staring up at the kitchen 's single window , far above his reach . He could see a few stars there , for the red glow of the embers was not enough to drown them out . The window was much too high , he told himself , to be touched by the waves , even in the wildest storm . And there was no storm tonight , just a gentle autumn breeze . Still , he thought that if this were his castle , he would shutter the windows , just to be sure . Finally , he got up and took his pallet out to the empty hall and set it where there was a wall between himself and that kitchen window , and all the other windows were far away . One lamp still lit the room , leaving heavy shadows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows . He fell asleep , an arm crooked protectively about his lute , both of them wrapped against the gentle autumn breeze in his well-wom cloak . When he woke to a touch on his shoulder , the lamp no longer burned , and dawn twilight showed through the windows . He knuckled sleep from his eyes and blinked up at the man who leaned over him . It was Lord Gazian , wearing a dressing gown of fine , pale wool that gave his body a ghostly cast in the dimness . " My lord ? " said Alaric . " Will you come upstairs , minstrel ? There is someone who would hear you sing . " Odd though the time was , Alaric rose , knowing that no good could come of reluctance . Carrying his lute close against his body , he followed the master of the lake through the arch and up the narrow , winding stairway beyond . At the third landing , they turned off the stair and walked along a curving corridor that was marked every ten paces by a narrow window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , the water reflecting the soft , gray-pink color of the eastern sky . They had passed four windows , making nearly a half-circle , before Lord Gazian halted at a door on the inner wall . He eased it open . The room was small , though richly hung with tapestries , and crowded by a bed , a chair , and some low chests . A bedside table held a small oil lamp , a tray of tiny pastries , and a cup . And the bed itself , wide enough for three men , held a boy of no more than seven summers , propped up on bolsters and covered with a light blanket . Even in the candlelight , Alaric could see that the boy was ill-his face was pale , with a sheen of moisture , and his dark eyes were sunk deep above his hollow cheeks . He said nothing when the lord of the castle and Alaric entered , though his gaze followed them to the side of his bed . Lord Gazian sat down on the edge of the mattress and gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . " I 've brought the minstrel for you . " He nodded at Alaric . " Thank you , Father , " said the boy in a small , soft voice . He looked at Alaric . " I 'm sorry to get you up so early . It is early , is n't it ? " " A little , " said Alaric . " But I do n't mind . " " Sometimes he does n't sleep well , " said his father , resting one large hand on the boy 's shoulder . " And last night the servants told him about you , and he hardly slept at all for asking when you would come upstairs . " " My nurse sings to me , " said the boy . " But they told me you sing much better . " " I am flattered , " said the minstrel . " Do you like songs about magic ? " " Oh , yes . " " About knights and dragons and fair maidens ? " The boy 's eyes widened . " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special listeners . " " Please , " breathed the boy . " Very well . " Alaric sat down on the foot of the bed and balanced his lute on his knee . " This is the tale of a boy who grew up to fight dragons . " And he launched into an old favorite in more familiar lands - the song of the youth who found an enchanted sword in a hollow tree , a sword that itself became his teacher . By the time he finished , with the young man slaying his monster and winning the hand of a king 's daughter , and the kingdom as well , the boy 's mouth hung open in wonder , and there was a bit of color in his cheeks . " Oh , another , please , minstrel , " he begged . Alaric looked at Lord Gazian , who nodded . In the end , he sang of magical adventures until the boy 's nurse came with his morning meal . " You must n't stop in the middle ! " the boy cried . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were very bright . " The child must eat , " said the nurse , as she set the tray on the bed . She was a stout woman , old enough to be Alaric 's grandmother , and the expression on her face was stern . She pointed to the tray of pastries , all untouched . " He 's eaten nothing since yesterday noon , not even one dainty , and you have excited him on an empty stomach , as well as keeping him from sleep . " " I did n't want to sleep , " said the boy . Shepropped him up farther on his bolsters . " You must sleep . And you must eat . How can you ever get well if you do n't sleep and eat , I ask ? " She lifted a cover from a bowl of porridge and dipped up a spoonful for him . He turned his head away from it . " Eat a little , my son , " said his father . He glanced at Alaric . " I 'm sure the minstrel would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaric . " I 'll be eating this very porridge downstairs shortly , and it smells excellent . " The boy frowned , but then he nibbled at the edge of the spoon and finally swallowed the whole amount . " A little more , " said the nurse , with another spoonful . The boy looked up at Alaric . " What is your name , minstrel ? " " Alaric . " " Mine is Ospir . " Alaric bowed . " Greetings , Ospir . " " Will you come back later ? " " If your father wishes it . The decision lies with him . " " Father ? " Lord Gazian caught the boy 's small hand for a moment . " If you will promise to eat your porridge , and to try to sleep , I 'll bring the minstrel back later . " The boy sighed . " Very well , Father . " " Good child , " said the lord of the castle , and he stood up . " Till later . " And he gestured Alaric toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " My lord , what ails the boy ? " Lord Gazian kept walking . " No one knows , minstrel . He has been sickly for most of his life . He is a good boy , though , and a patient one . " When they reached the foot of the steps , with the archway to the great hall before them , he stopped and turned back to Alaric . " Thank you , minstrel , for being kind to him . " " My lord , I am here to serve you . It would be poor service indeed to be unkind to your son . " The lord of the castle nodded and stepped through the arch . They broke their fast with more than porridge-with eggs and bread spread thick with butter , with slices of fat mutton and grilled fowl , and with a drink made of soured milk that Alaric found not as attractive as plain , clear water . But water there was in plenty-from a spring , servants explained , that rose from deep within the island and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that pure water should flow in the midst of the Lake of Death . " " This land is full of such springs , " said Master Demirchi . " There would be no fields without them . " Unlike his liege and brother , he was fully dressed for the day , in leather and soft , thin wool . " And without the fields , we would all be elsewhere . " He picked at his plate of mutton and eggs . " But I think a few people would come here anyway , just to carry off some of our deadly waters for a weapon . We are especially rich in that weapon , are we not , my brother ? " Lord Gazian cast him a sour glance . " Do n't ask again , " he said . Demirchi nodded toward Alaric . " The minstrel has traveled the world . Speak to him about it . " " I do n't wish to speak about it . I 've made my decision . " Demirchi peered with slitted eyes at Alaric . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few sealed containers of water from the Lake of Death ? " Alaric looked from one man to the other . " I do n't know , sir . Perhaps it is too dangerous to transport elsewhere . " " Nonsense , " said Demirchi . " We know how to deal with it . " " We have no need of outsiders " gold , " said Lord Gazian . With two fingers , Demirchi lifted the gold chain that hung at his throat . " This may be enough for you , but it wo n't buy new carpets for this room , or furniture , or weapons . I want a new sword ; must I trade my only chain for it when a cask of water would suffice ? " Gazian set the flats of both hands on the table . " I will not sell death , and that 's an end to it . When you rule here , if you rule , you may decide otherwise . Till then , we will leave off speaking of it . " " My brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him for a long moment , and then he said , " I know you have many responsibilities to attend to today . I would not keep you from them . " Demirchi made a disgusted noise and then stood up and strode from the room . The lord of the castle and the visiting minstrel were both quiet for a time , eating . Shortly after Demirchi left , a couple of other men came in and sat down to partake of the meal , and seeing the frown that lingered on their lord 's face , they said little and excused themselves quickly . Alone with Gazian again , Alaric was unsure of what to do . At last , he said , " Shall I sing for you , my lord ? " Gazian looked up from the remnants of his meal . There was tiredness in his eyes , in the slope of his shoulders . " You must be weary , minstrel , from waking so early . There is an empty chamber upstairs , just beyond my son 's room . Perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more . Tell one of the servants I said to help you with it . You can sing again later . " " You are kind , my lord . " He shook his head . " I think not , but I thank you for being so willing this morning . Go on . Rest . " " As you will , " said Alaric . Rather than disturb the servants , who all seemed busy enough , Alaric took the pallet upstairs himself . Half a dozen steps past young Ospir 's door was another ; he pushed it open . At first he thought he must be in the wrong chamber , for this one was not at all empty . Illuminated by a single narrow window , it was fully three times the size of the boy 's bedchamber , and richly furnished . The floor was almost entirely covered by a single large carpet , and the walls were hung partly with tapestries and partly with thick velvet curtains . A velvet settee stood in the center of the carpet , with a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it . On one wall was a fireplace of white stone , and against the other was a wide bed made up with fine pillows and quilts . Alaric backed out the door , to see if he had missed the room he was supposed to find . But this one was indeed beside the boy 's , and the corridor ended in a blank wall after it . Inside again , he laid his pallet on the floor beside the settee and made a circuit of the room . The fireplace contained no trace of wood or dung or ash , just a naked grate . The carpet , the tapestries , the settee and tables were worn much as the furnishings of the great hall were worn , but all were covered with a thin layer of dust . The bed was dusty , too , and stalesmelling , as if the bedclothes had not been aired in a long time . There was a chest at the foot of the bed , half covered by the quilt , with no lock to keep a curious minstrel out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid . Immediately , the sweet scents of cedar and lavender wafted up at him , the one lining the chest , the other sprinkled over the contents as dried blossoms . A woman 's clothing was packed inside linen and lace and embroidery , all heavily creased from lying long undisturbed . Alaric closed the lid again , and draped the quilt back over it . Whoever 's clothes they were , he thought , she had not worn them in quite some time . He moved his pallet nearer the window and looked out for a moment . It was a beautiful view , if one ignored its deadliness-the lake shining like polished metal , the fields spread out in a golden array , the sky clear and cloudless above the line of hills on the horizon . He imagined her , whoever she was , sitting on the windowsill and gazing out , perhaps with embroidery in her hands . And then he realized he was thinking of other castles , other hands , other embroidery left far behind , and he turned his mind away from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was as dusty as everything else in the room . He lay down on the pallet and closed his eyes . He was tired , as Lord Gazian had known , and he fell asleep quickly . A rough hand on his arm brought him out of jumbled dreams of the past . For a moment he thought Lord Gazian must be shaking him , and then he looked up and recognized Ospir 's nurse . " What are you doing here , minstrel ? " she demanded . Yawning , he stretched his arms out above his head . " Lord Gazian told me to sleep here . " " Did he ? " She loomed over him , hands on her hips , suspicion on her face and in her voice . Then , less sharply , she said , " Well , I suppose if you had come here without permission , you would have closed the door . But to send you to her room . " She clucked her tongue . " Whose room is it ? " asked Alaric . " His lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so near the boy 's ? " " Yours . " " Not a room like this , " she said indignantly . " Mine is on the other side , and befitting my station . This is a finer chamber than even Lord Gazian 's own . " " But Lord Gazian 's lady does n't live in this chamber , " said Alaric . The corners of the nurse 's mouth turned down . " She died giving my lord an heir . " And she nodded toward the wall behind which Ospir lay . " And Lord Gazian never took another wife ? " She shook her head . " None could compare to her . He loved her , minstrel . " She laid a hand on the back of the settee and stroked the wom velvet . " Many was the time they sat here together , and I brought them dinner , just the two of them here in this room . It seems so long ago . I air the room sometimes , just for the memory of her . Poor lady . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the real world . Far more often than in song . " A sad tale , " he said . She looked at him sharply . " One you could put to music , I suppose , just one tale among many . I heard about your tales from the other servants . Fancies and lies , most of them , it seems . " " Some . Others have a bit of truth to them . " " A small bit , I 'd think . But the boy likes them-I 'll say that for you . " " That pleases me , " said the minstrel . He glanced out the window , saw that the sun was high ; he had slept most of the morning away . " Is he awake now ? " She had already turned toward the door , but she paused at his question . " Yes . Why do you ask ? " " I thought I would visit him before going downstairs , if he were awake . " " His uncle is with him . " " Master Demirchi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alaric pushed his covering cloak aside and got to his feet . " I was told yesterday that Demirchi was the her . But you just said it was the boy . Surely this land is n't large enough for two . " The nurse lowered her voice . " No one expects the boy to live out the winter . He has never been well , not since his babyhood , and two years ago my lord decided that another her must be named . " " Poor child , " murmured Alaric . " He is a good boy , " said the nurse . " Will Master Demirchi stay long with him now ? " " He never stays very long . " " Then I will wait . " His lute under one arm , he followed the nurse to the door of Ospir 's room and stood outside as the woman slipped in . He caught a glimpse of Demirchi sitting on the bed , holding the boy 's hand , and then the nurse closed the door again . Shortly , Demirchi came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " but I beg you not to tire him . He has little strength these days . " Alaric bowed . " It must be hard to lie in bed for so much time , sir . I only desire to make it a bit easier for him . " Demirchi nodded . " We will see you later in the great hall ? " " Of course , sir . I am here to sing for all who will listen . " " At dinner , then . " He walked off down the corridor . Inside the room , Ospir greeted Alaric in his small , soft voice . " Thank you for coming back so soon . " " I had some porridge and took a nap , which I hope you did as well , and now I am ready for a little more music . " " He ate and slept , " said the nurse . " He has been a good child this morning . " " And my uncle came to visit , " said Ospir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me laugh . But you are here , and that makes up for his going . " Alaric sat down on the edge of the bed . " Well , I will try to make you laugh , too , if your nurse does not mind . " The woman waved a hand , as if in permission , and Alaric began a long , complicated song about a wolf who tried to trick eight sheep into leaving their fold to run away with him . By the time he was done , the boy was laughing , and the nurse was as well . But in the midst of his laughter , Ospir began to cough , a deep , hollow cough ; and when he could not stop , his nurse had to help him sit up , and she rubbed his thin chest until at last the spasms passed . By that time he was half-fainting , and as he fell back on the pillow , a trickle of blood started from a corner of his mouth . The nurse swabbed his sweaty forehead and wiped the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go now , minstrel . " " No , " gasped the boy , his voice smaller than ever . " Please . " He closed his eyes , and he was so pale , and his breathing became so shallow , that Alaric thought he must be dying that very moment . " Should n't we call his father ? " he asked the nurse . Then Ospir 's eyes opened , and the look in them was beseeching . " I 'll be all right , " he whispered . " Please sing . " The nurse nodded to Alaric . " Something more serious . " And so Alaric returned to songs of knights and fair maidens , of sorcerers and monsters , and of lands beyond the horizon . He sang softly , though , and after a time he left a song unfinished , because he knew the boy slept . The nurse walked with him into the corridor and closed the door gently between them and the child . " I 'm sorry , " said Alaric . " I did n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had congestion of the lungs before , but never so bad . They die sometimes , after the blood comes . And he is very weak , poor child . " She looked down at her hands , which were clenched in the voluminous fabric of her skirt . " I shall call his father now . " Alaric trailed after her to the great hall , where Lord Gazian sat talking with two men in bossed armor . When informed of his son 's condition , he directed the two to find his brother , and then he went upstairs . Master Demirchi came in from the courtyard a short time later and went up , too . Neither man asked Alaric to come along . He went to the kitchen for a time , and listened to the talk among the servants . None was surprised that the child was so gravely ill ; they had been expecting his death for two years already . They speculated on how long the mourning period would be , and then they asked Alaric to sing , because there might not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , Alaric went upstairs , though unbidden , to see what he could see . The door to the boy 's chamber stood ajar , and inside both Gazian and Demirchi sat on the bed , on opposite sides , and the nurse hovered near . That left little space for another visitor , so he did not attempt to enter . He could see , though , that the boy was awake , with one hand held by his father and the other by his uncle . None of them seemed to notice Alaric standing in the corridor . Silently , he slipped on down the passageway to Ospir 's mother 's chamber . Entering , he shut the door quietly but firmly , and then he bolted it . He laid his lute on the settee . The strange and magical north lay far behind him , and in it the elixir so powerful that it brought the dead back to life . He had never intended to return there , never intended to revisit Kata the witch , who brewed that elixir , but now he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mountainside above the northern valley that was now her home . The air about him was suddenly crisp with the northern autumn , and he shivered a little as he scanned the valley floor . He looked past the harvested fields and the peasant dwellings , past the great fortress that guarded all and the people who walked its battlements and strolled in and out through its gate . He looked , finally , to the shore of the river that had created the valley , and there he saw the tent , figured all over with the symbol of the sacred Pole Star , that belonged to Kata . A moment later , he was thrusting aside its entrance flap and stepping into her firelit domain . She sat cross-legged by the fire , a grinding stone upon her lap , a pestle in her hand , the bags and bundles that held her possessions piled all around her , Her thick , dark braids brushed her knees as she bent over her work , the smooth muscles of her slender arms flexed beneath their load of leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met his , there was not the slightest trace of surprise in her face . " Greetings , my Alaric , " she said in the soft , lilting accent of the north . " You return to us . " He shook his head . " No . I only come to ask a favor . " She smiled a little . " If you wish a favor , you must give one in return . " He sat down beside her . " This is not for myself . It is for a child . " One of her eyebrows rose . " Whose child ? " " Not mine . The child of my host , far to the south . He is sick , perhaps near death , and I would help him . " " Ah , soft-hearted Alaric . Has your softness not found you enough trouble in your life ? Had you stayed in the north , you would have become hard , as we are hard . " " I am what I am , lady . Will you give me the elixir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a square of muslin , twisted the cloth into a sack , and tied its mouth with a strip of sinew . " These are the leaves you helped us bring back from the Great Waste . Shall I withhold from you your share of what I make of them ? It would be ungrateful of me . " " You are fair , lady . You have always been fair to me . " " How old is the child ? " " Seven , I believe , and small for his age . " She dipped into a bag and pulled out a ceramic flask the size of her fist and sealed with wax . She also found a spoon made of hom . " Give him two spoonfuls diluted in a cup of wine each day till the elixir is gone . If it can help him at all , that will be enough . " Alaric took the flask and the spoon . " Thank you , lady . Now , what favor can I offer you in return ? " She caught his wrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " I ca n't stay . " " You will never find what you seek . " " I have given up seeking , lady . " She looked long into his eyes . " No , " she said at last . " Do n't fool yourself , minstrel . You will never give up . Songs and travel will never be enough for you . One day , I think , you will go back to your past , you will not be able to resist it any longer . I hope it does not disappoint you too badly . " " I have nothing to go back to , " said Alaric , and the words were thick in his throat . " Those are only words , my minstrel . " She let go of his wrist . " Is there a woman in this place you 've come from ? The mother of the child , perhaps ? " " No . No woman . " She smiled again and stroked his cheek with one finger . " I find that hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've only been there two days . " " Then there is still plenty of time . Tell me about this place , " she said . " Tell me about all your wanderings since you left us . " He looked down at the flask and the spoon . " Lady , I can not . The child might die while I entertained you . You must understand ... " She nodded slowly . " I do understand . And you must also understand that you will always be welcome among us . Always . " " Farewell , " he whispered . An instant later he was back in the chamber next to Ospir 's . Lord Gazian , Demirchi , and the nurse were still in the tiny bedroom , and Ospir was still breathing , though laboriously , when Alaric slipped in . Demirchi was the first to look up at him . " Not now , minstrel , " he murmured . " I have an elixir which I picked up in my travels , " Alaric said , showing the flask . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grave illnesses , and I believe that it might help the boy . " Demirchi glanced at the flask . " Are you a healer as well as a minstrel , Master Alaric ? " " I 've used it myself more than once . I know its power . " Demirchi shook his head sharply . " We want no unknown elixirs for the boy . " Lord Gazian looked up then . " You 've taken it ? " he said . " Yes , my lord , " said Alaric . " Had you a fever ? " " A high one , my lord . " " And so has my son . Bring your elixir here . " Alaric squeezed by Demirchi and the nurse to stand beside the lord of the castle . " Give it to me , " said Gazian . Alaric handed over the flask . " Two spoonfuls should be given each day in a cup of wine , " he said . He held the hom spoon up . " This is the measure . " Gazian perforated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elixir . " It has a pungent smell , " he said . " Harsh . Like cloves . Is it bitter ? " " Not in wine , my lord , " said Alaric . " Fetch some wine , " Gazian said to Demirchi . " Brother , what do we know of this stuff ? " said Demirchi . " It might be poisonous . " " I will taste it if you wish , " said Alaric . " The wine , brother , " said Gazian . " Let me get it , my lord , " the nurse said suddenly , and before anyone could object , she hurried from the room . In a voice barely audible , Ospir murmured , " I will take it , Father . " " Good boy , " said Gazian , caressing his son 's cheek . The nurse returned shortly with a carafe and a cup . Alaric measured the elixir and mixed it with the wine , and then he spooned out a mouthful and swallowed it in full sight of the others . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One spoonful of dilute poison might be harmless to a grown man , and a cup of it deadly to a weakened child . " Lord Gazian looked at his son . " We have nothing better to try , " he said . " Come , my child , drink . " And he held the cup to Ospir 's lips . It took some time to finish the cup , for the wine was strong for such a young child , and the elixir , Alaric knew , made it taste odd , but at last he drank it all . Then he closed his eyes and whispered , " May the minstrel sing for me ? " Gazian nodded to Alaric . The minstrel chose a lullaby of many soft , sweet verses , and by the time he was finished , Ospir was sleeping . Lord Gazian gestured for all but the nurse to leave , and out in the corridor , he said , " If your elixir helps him , you will be well-rewarded , minstrel . " " If it helps him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaric . Gazian took his arm . " Come down to the hall and sing for us now . I have need of diversion . " The remainder of the afternoon was a restless one . For a time , Alaric sang , and the lord of the castle and his brother listened . And for a time , other men joined them and the group played at a game with colored stones on an octagonal board . Master Demirchi got up often and went to the foot of the stairway , but Gazian always called him back , saying that word would be sent if there were anything to know . The household dined , though Lord Gazian ate little , and then Alaric sang again . Night fell , and at last the master of the Lake of Death dispatched a servant to his son 's room , but the servant could only report that the boy was sleeping still . Lord Gazian looked at his brother . " Perhaps you should see to the mourning ceremonies , in case they become necessary . " He rose heavily from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balcony , not to be disturbed .. unless there is some word from above . " Demirchi inclined his head . " As you wish . " " Come , minstrel . I would listen to more music , if you can . " " I can , my lord . " Alaric followed him up the stairs , to the second landing this time , through a doorway , and down a broad , shallow flight of steps . At the bottom was a door heavier than any he had seen elsewhere in the castle , oak almost solid with iron banding and fastened shut by two great horizontal beams . Gazian unbarred it with one hand , the beams swinging easily on well-oiled pivots , and pulled it open . Beyond lay a balcony open to the night sky . There were no lamps on the balcony , but the moon rode low on the horizon , casting its silver gleam upon a space three paces deep and a dozen wide , with a hip-high wall guarding its rim . Lord Gazian went to that wall and leaned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , he saw that the surface of the water lay only a couple of man-heights below . The waves were calm beneath the moon , but a pale mist was rising from them , swirling in the gentle breeze . Alaric stepped back from the wall . " No need to be afraid , minstrel , " said Lord Gazian . " The waves never come this high . " " The mist , " said Alaric . Gazian shook his head . " Harmless . " He looked out over the water . " Though they say the ghosts of everyone who ever died in this land are in that mist . They say the lake holds them prisoner , and they wander over its surface every night , trying to escape . I 've seen them myself , whatever they are - vague figures in the distance , writhing . Sometimes I 've even heard them moan . Or perhaps it was just the wind . " Alaric looked where he was looking and saw only mist , thicker here and thinner there . " I wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is among them . And I wonder if she will be happy if our son joins her . " Alaric said nothing . Gazian glanced at him over one shoulder . " He sleeps long . Is it the sleep that comes before death ? " " The elixir always brings sleep , " said Alaric . " It may be too late for your elixir , minstrel . " " I hope not . " He sighed . " I have not much hope left in me . Once , I had hoped to see him grow up strong to care for my people after me . I can no longer remember when anyone still thought that was possible . " His head sank down between his arms . " Sing , Master Alaric . Sing of hope . " And Alaric sang , as the moon glimmered on the deadly waters and the mist writhed and twisted above them . He sang of quests successful and of love affirmed . And as the moon rose ever higher , he thought , once or twice , that he too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his music had raised them . Later , Lord Gazian dismissed him , with permission to use his lady 's old bedchamber once more . In the morning , before breaking fast , Alaric tapped at Ospir 's door to make sure the nurse administered another dose of elixir . She woke the boy to do so , but he went to sleep almost immediately afterward . For the brief moments his eyes were open , he did not seem to recognize either her or the minstrel . In the great hall , all the day was as restless as the previous afternoon had been . Halfway through , Lord Gazian sent his brother out on some errand to keep him from going to the stairway so often . He himself saw to all the myriad details of life in the castle , but offhandedly . He spumed the game of colored stones and dismissed the men who would play it with him . And he hardly listened when Alaric sang , pacing instead , back and forth across the hall , even going out to the courtyard and up onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time , looking out toward the village of his peasants . He was there when a servant came running through the great hall with word that Ospir was awake , hungry and thirsty , and asking for the minstrel . Gazian raced up the stairway . Alaric and a servant with a tray of broth and bread followed at a more demure pace . They found the boy sitting up , supported by his bolsters , his nurse 's arm , and his father 's strong hands . The nurse gestured peremptorily for the tray and , choosing the cup of broth , held it to the boy 's lips . He drank greedily . " Not so fast , my darling , " she said . " Small sips at first . " She moved the cup away from his mouth . " But I am so thirsty , " he said . " Drink again in a moment . " He saw Alaric standing in the doorway . " Sing for me , please minstrel . I dreamed you sang for me . " " As you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy drank more broth and even ate a little bread , Alaric sang of knights and fair maidens and fire-breathing monsters . Over the next few days , as he continued to drink the elixir , the boy improved dramatically . His fever vanished , his paleness was replaced by healthy color , his eyes brightened , his cheeks lost their sunken look . By the time the flask was empty , he could even stand up , though his legs were weak and shaky after so much time in bed . But his small , soft voice was stronger , and his laugh was clear and unmarred by any coughing . Three days later , he insisted upon going downstairs to the great hall , so that he could dine with his father and uncle ; he even walked part of the way . Seeing him sitting so straight upon his cushioned bench , the servants and the men in bossed leather made much of him , and he answered them like a little lord , graciously , his face glowing with the attention . But his nurse would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and as soon as the meal was done , his father carried him back upstairs , laughing with him , laughing loud and long . That night , Alaric sang him to sleep , as had become his habit . " How can I reward you , minstrel . " Lord Gazian asked for the dozenth time as he and his brother and Alaric sat by lamplight in the great hall . Alaric just shook his head and strummed his lute . He had already politely refused Gazian 's own gold chain as being a gift that would only be stolen from him somewhere along the road . He understood how rare such wealth was near the Lake of Death and he , who could steal all the gold he wished , did not want to carry off any of their poor treasures . " I have everything I want - good food , a soft place to sleep , music , and listeners who like what I offer . " " But you wander the world , never knowing where your next meal will come from , never knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " " Minstrels are bom wanderers , my lord . We do n't mind sleeping in the open or hunting game for our suppers . " " A homeless life . Not one most men would choose . " Alaric shrugged . " In truth , I have a thousand homes , for wherever folk are good hosts , there I feel welcome . As here . " " Do you indeed feel welcome here , Master Alaric ? " " I do . " Lord Gazian leaned forward . " Then stay with us . Make your life here . The boy would like that , I know , and I would as well . " " This is a kind offer , my lord . " " And there would be no need to sing every night , only when you wished it . You would be as a member of my own family , like a second younger brother . " Alaric glanced at Demirchi , who was lounging back in his chair , playing with his gold chain . " That is too high for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brother already . " " Call it what you will , " said Gazian . " This is my desire . " Alaric drew another chord from the lute . " You overwhelm me , my lord . " " Will you do it ? " " I must think . This is a great decision . I have a certain sort of life , and giving it up would be hard . " " This is a wealthy land , " said Gazian , " and a safe one , as you know . " " Wealthy ? " muttered Demirchi . He looked at Alaric from beneath lowered eyelids . " Surely our young minstrel has seen wealthier . He 's traveled the world and seen castles full of gold , have n't you , lad ? " " Occasionally , " said Alaric . " Our wealth is our grain and livestock , " said Gazian . " That is the only wealth that matters . The rest is mere display . " " And will you still be saying that when we are all sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demirchi . " You exaggerate , my brother . " Demirchi snorted . " The peasants already sit on stone . And you wo n't even sell a little of our surplus grain to buy us wood . " Gazian looked at him . " The lord who sells his grain is a fool . I 've told you I will not flirt with famine . " " There has n't been a famine since our great-grandfather 's day . " " And you can promise me there never will be , is that it ? " " Brother - " " Enough . I wo n't hear you try to win the minstrel to your side with these tired old arguments . If you want wood , go trade your own gold chain for a fine chair at some great town . I wo n't stop you . " Demirchi made no reply to that , only frowned at his brother and fingered the chain . Alaric looked from one of them to the other . " I am sorry to be the cause of such a quarrel , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair . " It is an old quarrel , minstrel , " he said , and then his frown twisted into a sardonic smile . " One I never win . But that does not make me give up . Perhaps when we , too , are sitting on stone benches , my brother will finally think again about our wealth . " He rose to his feet . " Now I shall bid you good night , brother , and you , Master Alaric . I hope you will stay with us , minstrel , for every time he sees you , my brother will remember that there is a world beyond this lake . " He bowed slightly and left by way of the stairway to the upper floors . Lord Gazian looked at his own gold chain for a moment after his brother had gone . Then he raised his eyes to Alaric 's . " Are we too poor for you , minstrel ? " Alaric smiled . " I have sung at great houses and small , to listeners clothed in velvet and listeners clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment . Just in the food they offered . And your food is excellent , my lord . " Gazian nodded . " And our enjoyment is high . It always would be . Think hard on your decision , Alaric . " " I will , my lord . I promise . " " Now ... perhaps one last song before we sleep ? " " Of course , my lord . " And he sang of a long dark journey to a distant land where a sip of the water could make one immortal , as long as one never left . The youth who made the journey stayed many centuries and was happy , but he went out at last , homesick for the place of his birth , and crumbled to dust as soon as he passed the land 's enchanted border . When the song was done , Gazian said , " Is that what you think of my offer ? That someday you would regret staying ? " Alaric shook his head . " It is only a song , my lord . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . He is not completely well yet . What if he falls ill again ? Only you know where to find the elixir . He has been ill so much of his life ! " Alaric slid his hand along the strings of his lute , eliciting only the faintest murmur of sound . Then he said , " I could draw you a map . But it is a long , hard journey . And no promise that at the end the maker of the elixir would give any to a stranger . " " So much the more do we need you . " " I need time to think , my lord . " Gazian leaned toward him and gripped his arm . " You will be a brother to me . I swear it . " Alaric smiled . " It is not a repellent offer , my lord . But I need a little time . " " Of course , " said Gazian , letting go of him . " I look forward to your answer , whenever you are ready with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went upstairs . He lay awake for a while , considering the offer . It was not the best he had ever had , nor the worst . It had certain attractions , not the least the quality of the food . But he had eaten good food elsewhere . And he had met kind people elsewhere . And he had never stayed . He had not decided what to tell Lord Gazian by the time he fell asleep . He awoke to the sound of someone entering the room and to light , though not the light of morning . It was a small oil lamp , and Master Demirchi held it high . Outside the chamber window , the sky was still black as midnight . " Minstrel ? " said Demirchi . Alaric sat up on his pallet . " Yes ? " " My lord and brother wishes to see you on the postern balcony . " " Is it Ospir ? " " No . Will you come ? " Alaric pushed his cloak aside and reached for his lute . " Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great iron-banded door . A low half-moon illuminated the lake and the stone balcony . The lake was misty , the balcony was empty . " He 'll be here shortly , " said Demirchi . " You were quicker to wake and gather yourself together than we presumed . " " Very well , " said Alaric , and he played a chord on the lute . Demirchi went to the stone railing and looked out over the lake . " You would n't think that something so beautiful could be so deadly , " he said . " No , " said Alaric . The mist swirled , so heavy in some places that the surface of the water was hidden . Peering at it , Alaric now had no trouble imagining shapes in the wind-stirred whiteness  --  buildings , trees , even human figures moving upon the water . " My lord Gazian says there are ghosts on the lake . In the mist . " " Oh , yes . I see them often . But they never come near the castle . " Alaric stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village also see them ? " " I do n't know , " said Demirchi . " I 've never asked . Ah , look at that one there . A woman with her arms stretched out to us . " Alaric followed the line of his pointing finger . " Where ? " " Farther to the right . " Alaric squinted into the mist . " I do n't quite- " At that moment , he felt a tremendous blow on the back of his head , an impact so sudden and sharp that it pushed him beyond pain and into a moonless , starless , insensate dark . But he was there , it seemed , for only an instant , wrapped in the thick black velvet of nothing ; and then , abruptly , he was enveloped in water , and his mouth and nose were filled with the thick bitterness of brine . He swallowed the vile stuff , breathed it in , choked , and flailed his arms and legs in panic . His struggles brought him to the surface , coughing and gasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming above him , the postern balcony jutting out over the deadly water . He fought the terror that told him his skin was stripping away from his bones , running like wax melting from a candle . With horrible clarity , he knew where he was and where he wanted to be . In his own special way , he leaped . And tumbled into the cold , fresh water of the river beside Kata 's tent . In a moment , he was pulling himself up its grassy bank , stopping half in and half out of the water , vomiting and coughing and drawing great ragged breaths of air . Then he rolled back into the river to rinse himself again . By the time he finally crawled out of the water , Kata was waiting for him , a burning brand held high in one hand . " What is all this commotion ? " she said . He tried to strip off his clothes , thinking that they might still bear some trace of the deadly water , and when she moved to help him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its touch . " It will kill you , " he told her . " Maybe it has killed me already . " The wet shirt came off at last . " What are you talking about ? Are you wounded ? " She held the torch close and peered at him . " I fell into the Lake of Death . The water will eat the flesh from your bones in a few heartbeats . They spray it at their enemies . " He had his trews off now and was shivering in the northern breeze . He clutched himself with crossed arms . Kata gripped his shoulder hard , and when he tried to pull away , she slapped his face and gripped him again . " This flesh looks well enough to me . " He looked at his shaking hands , his arms , his chest . " Not a mark on you , " she said . " Now come sit by the fire . " Inside her warm tent , Alaric 's shivering subsided . Kata thrust the brand into the fire , stirring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely . Again she found no signs of damage . " There are substances which can dissolve flesh , " she said , running her hands firmly over his arms and torso , " but they make it slippery first , and your flesh is not . Tell me , does this Lake of Death have a scent ? Pungent ? Sharp ? Making the eyes stream ? Alaric shook his head . " And what is the taste of it ? " " Salty and bitter . " " Open your mouth . " She lit a splint and held it near his face . " Your tongue is normal , and the inside of your mouth . Is your throat painful ? " " No . But it made my eyes bum . " " Any brine would do that . Is your vision harmed ? " " I do n't think so . And the burning is less now . " Kata dropped the splint into the fire . " This deadly lake water would seem not so deadly then . " " But it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kata looked at him sharply . " Is this my Alaric speaking ? " He hesitated , remembering Taskol 's cautions , Demirchi 's desire to sell the water as a weapon . " It has kept their enemies away for generations . " Kata nodded , then she dipped into one of her bags and pulled out a long-handled bronze ladle . " Bring me a sample of this water , Alaric . I would examine it closely . " Alaric took the ladle , but he said , " This will not reach the water , lady , not from any safe place . " " Then we will give it a longer handle . " Under the bundles on one side of her tent she found a spare support pole , as long as Alaric was tall . " Will this suffice ? " Outside , they bound the pole to the ladle with strong sinew . " You must promise me to be very careful , lady , " Alaric said , the pole set on his shoulder like a pike , the bowl of the ladle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naked , he traveled to the lake shore near the place where the causeway began . The mist was thick there , and the shore deserted , as he expected . He flitted to a spot a dozen paces along the stone road , and lying flat on his stomach , stretching his arm downward to its limit , he was able to scoop up a small amount of water . He climbed to his feet carefully , waited a few moments for the ladle to stop dripping , and returned to the north . Kata held a ceramic bowl while he poured the contents of the ladle into it . Then they went inside her tent . " No , there is no odd scent , " she said , after sniffing at the liquid . " Nor the oiliness that would mark some of the more powerful flesh-dissolvers . " She found a thin strip of leather and dangled one end into the bowl . She moved it around , stirring the water . " A few heartbeats , you say . " " That 's what they told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it closely . Then she dunked it again , for a longer time , and pulled it out . " I see nothing . " " I do n't know that this is a fair test , " said Alaric . " Leather is skin , is it not ? " " Cured skin . Perhaps that makes it proof against the deadliness , I was told the people have ways of carrying it , even of pumping it . " " No doubt , " said Kata , and she thrust her finger into the bowl . " No ! " said Alaric . " My Alaric , this is a brine , nothing more . " She stirred it with her finger . " Look . " She raised her unharmed finger from the bowl . And then she licked it and nodded . " A strong brine and a bitter one . Saltier by far than the Northern Sea , and with more salts than just the one we put on our food . But a pleasant enough bath , I think , if you had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , my Alaric , falling into a lake you so feared . " " I did n't fall , " he said . " I was pushed . By someone who believed the water would kill me . I know he believed it . " " Ah . " She set the bowl down by the fire . " Well , I suppose they must , and their enemies , too . What strange beliefs there are in the south , with no proof behind them ! " He sighed . " Well , the water will prove deadly enough to something . I had my lute when I went in . And I did n't think to bring it north with me . So it floats ... somewhere in the lake . " " And it wo n't survive the wetting . " " No . I shall have to find another . " " You 've done that before . " " Yes . Yes . " He stared into the fire , but his inner eye saw the Lake of Death instead . He thought back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought about Gazian himself , and Ospir and Demirchi . Especially Demirchi . And he wondered if Demirchi had paused on the stairs to listen to his last song , and to the conversation that followed it . Or perhaps he had not needed to hear them . Perhaps his decision had been made while he played with his gold chain . " I must go back , " he said at last . " To a place where they tried to kill you ? " " I must . " " For revenge , my Alaric ? That is not like you . " " No . To protect someone . " They dried his clothes over Kata 's fire , and a moment after he put them on , he was back in his temporary bedchamber in Lord Gazian 's castle . Dawn had not yet come . He slipped into Ospir 's room . The boy was sleeping soundly , and the nurse was dozing in the chair at the foot of the bed . Gently , Alaric touched her shoulder , and when she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him . In the corridor , the door closed between themselves and Ospir , he said , " Why were you so eager to fetch the wine the first night we gave the boy the elixir ? " She frowned . " I , Master Alaric ? I only wanted to bring it so that the boy could drink . " " Lord Gazian had ordered his brother to fetch it . " " But he was delaying , Master Alaric . " " He would have gone in another moment , you know that . Or my lord would have given you the order . But you did n't wait . " " Master Alaric - " " With all that talk of poison , were you afraid of what Master Demirchi might fetch ? " Her eyes became wary . " I would never say anything like that ! " " But I think you must know that Master Demirchi did not want the boy to live . Does not want the boy to live . " The woman hesitated . " He was happy to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy is no longer ill . Demirchi will not be the heir . " " Master Alaric - " He gripped her shoulder hard . " Tell me the truth , woman . Do n't you think Demirchi knows that you suspect him ? Or do you try to ingratiate yourself with him by your silence ? " She shook her head . " I do n't know what you mean . " " And you left the two of them together many a time , did n't you , so that Demirchi could put his evil powders in the boy 's cup , his bowl , his pastries ? " " The boy loves him , and he loves the boy . What is this talk of evil powders ? " " Or perhaps you put them there yourself . " " I No ! " Shall I tell Lord Gazian why his son has been so sick for so many years ? " " You would not accuse me ! " " I would tell the truth . And because I saved the boy 's life , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Oh , Masteralaric , do n't accuse me . What could I do ? I am only a servant , and he is my lord 's brother . He could throw me into the lake ! I never wished the boy ill . I love him dearlly . " " But not as much as your own life . " The tears overflowed down her cheeks . " No , not as much . " She covered one side of her face with her hand . " You are an outsider . You do n't know . It is a terrible death . " " I do know , " he said softly . " He killed me that way . " Her mouth dropped open . " Yes , " said Alaric . " I am dead . And I am part of the mist on the lake now . But I know how to enter the castle . Go tell Master Demirchi that I wish to see him on the postem balcony . Now . " She shook her head . " He sleeps . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , " said Alaric and , letting go of her abruptly , he vanished . The balcony was deserted when , in the next heartbeat , he appeared there . The iron-banded door was closed and barred from the inside - he checked it to be sure , flitting in and out in an instant . He sat down , then , on the hip-high wall , one knee drawn up , his crossed arms resting on it . He waited . Shortly , he heard the sound of the bars being drawn . The door swung inward , revealing Demirchi . " Come out , Master Demirchi , " he said , smiling . Demirchi stood where he was . " Now I know without any doubt that there are ghosts in the mist , " said Alaric . " They thank you for sending me to them , for they liked my singing and wanted the singer among them forever . " " No , " said Demirchi . " Yes , " said Alaric . " The flesh stripped off my bones quite cleanly , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor thing . But I shall seek its ghost shortly , and we will make ghostly music on the lake . You will hear it at night , Demirchi , and remember what you did . " Demirchi gripped the edge of the door . " Go away , " he said hoarsely . " Oh , I will never go away now . You have made certain of that . I will visit you often , mostly at night , but perhaps in the daytime , too . And perhaps I will bring my ghost friends with me . And together , tomorrow or the next day or the next , we will tell Lord Gazian how you killed me , and how you tried to kill his son . I imagine such ghost testimony would be believed , do n't you ? " " You ca n't come inside , " said Demirchi . " The ghosts must stay on the lake ! " " But you know I 've already been inside . You ca n't keep me out . Unless ... " " Unless what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What sort of bargain ? " Alaric drew his other leg up and sat tailor-fashion on the wall . " You must swear that you will never try to harm the boy again . That 's simple , is n't it ? Your promise in return for mine not to bother you and not to tell Lord Gazian . " Demirchi took one small step forward , still clinging to the door . " How do I know you will keep your promise ? " " You have only my word . And I will have only yours . Is that not enough ? I wo n't be far , of course . I 'll know if you forswear yourself . And do n't think you can evade me by persuading someone else to do the deed . I 'll know where the responsibility lies . Ghosts always know things like that . You would be amazed at what the ghosts of this lake know . " Demirchi took another step forward . " You do n't look like a ghost . " Alaric shrugged . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll fade into the mist . Or perhaps the other ghosts will learn from me how to become ... more substantial . " Abruptly , Demirchi leaped , arms outstretched . But Alaric was too quick this time , and vanished , reappearing at the far end of the balcony . Demirchi 's thighs struck the stone railing , and his momentum , unchecked by his intended target , carried him over the edge . He screamed once before he splashed into the water . But after the splash not a sound came from him , not a cough or a gasp or the slightest audible hint of limbs flailing in water . Alaric leaned over the railing and saw him by moonlight , floating half submerged , face upward , motionless . Even if he had been struggling , there was no way he could climb back to the overhanging balcony , and the shore was a long swim away , especially for someone who had feared the water so much that he surely had never learned to swim . Resigning himself to being wet again , Alaric used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gripped the man 's arms , and in another moment , they were both back on the balcony . Demirchi sagged limply in Alaric 's grasp , and Alaric eased him to the stone floor . " Wake up , Master Demirchi ! " he said sharply , kneeling over him and slapping his face . But Demirchi did not wake , and at last Alaric put a hand on the great vein of his neck and then bent to press an ear against his chest . He found no heartbeat . " Is he dead ? " came a small , soft voice from nearby . Alaric looked up and saw Ospir in the doorway , clutching the curved handle of the great iron and oaken door with both hands . " How long have you been standing there ? " Ospir edged forward slightly . " I heard what you said to my nurse . I listened at the bottom of the door , where it does n't quite meet the floor . And then I followed him and stood at the next landing . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he ? He was in the water . But he looks all right . I 've heard the water makes you look horrible . " " Yes , he 's dead . But the water did n't kill him , Ospir . His fear of it did . Would you like to know a secret ? " The boy nodded . " The water is harmless . It tastes bad , but touching it wo n't hurt you . " " That is n't what Father says . " " No . It is n't . " Alaric climbed slowly to his feet . Water dripped down his arms , his back , his legs , joining the puddle in which Demirchi lay . The boy clung to the door , two paces from that puddle , and did not try to move closer . Alaric wanted to reach out to him , to caress that small dark head , to give him comfort at the sight of death . But he did not . " Well , you must believe your father , " he said finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . " The boy looked up at him . " You said he tried to kill me . " " Yes . He made you very sick . But he wo n't be able to do that anymore , and you 'll be well from now on . " " He did bring me things . Sweets . Were they bad for me ? " " His were . But you 'll have others now , and they wo n't hurt you . " The boy heaved a great sigh . " I did like him . I did . Why did he want to kill me ? " " Because he wanted to be lord of this land after your father . And that is your right , as long as you are alive . " " I liked him very much . " For a moment , Ospir 's voice was as tiny as at the depth of his illness . " Was that wrong , Master Alaric ? " " No , Ospir , it 's not wrong to like people . " " I like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched one hand out toward Alaric , then pulled it back without touching him . " You 're really a ghost , are n't you ? " " What do you think ? " " You appeared and disappeared . Only a ghost can do that . Or one of the magic people from your songs . " Alaric looked down at Demirchi 's body for a moment , and then he nodded . " Yes , I am a ghost . And now I must leave the castle , because dawn will come soon . " " Oh , do n't go ! " " I must . But if you look out on the lake at night , and you see the mist swirling above the water , you 'll be seeing me . Never doubt that , Ospir . You 'll always be seeing me . And I will never let any of the other ghosts harm you . Not even his . " He smiled at the boy one last time . " Farewell , future lord of the Lake of Death . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaric shook his head . " Ask your nurse to sing . " " She 's crying . " " Then tell her for me that she should sing instead . " And he vanished . But he did not go far , just to the shore of the lake , just beyond the wavering mist . From there , the castle was ghostly , wreathed in wispy whiteness , the postem balcony invisible . Walking at the verge , beside the crust of salts , he began to circle the lake . He had not gotten more than a quarter of the way around when he saw ghosts in the mist . Not vague , distant figures that might as easily have been imaginary as real , but solid bodies of flesh and bone , dressed in thin white wool , moving across the surface of the water not a score of paces from the shore . There were four of them , and all were shorter than he . " I see you , " he said . " You might as well come here . " After some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and one by one the others followed . Their feet seemed to slide over the water 's surface , and when they were closer , he realized that they walked on that surface on wide wooden boards that were strapped to their feet like huge sandals , like the webbed frameworks that the people of the north used for walking on top of snow . When they grounded at the verge , he recognized Yosat , Taskol 's son , and three of the other village boys who had listened to him sing beside the headman 's home . " So you are the ghosts of the lake , " he said , watching them unfasten the boards from their feet . " Do your parents know what games you play at night ? " " Our fathers gave us these foot-rafts , " said Yosat . " Are n't you afraid of the water ? The deadly water . " The boys looked at one another and shuffled uneasily . " So you all know , " said Alaric . " It 's only the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You wo n't tell anyone , will you ? " said Yosat , his voice anxious . " I ? Oh , I wo n't be able to tell anyone . I 'm a ghost , too , killed this very night by the terrible water . You 'll hear about me tomorrow , I 'd guess . And if , someday , some minstrel happens to sing of this place , why , folk will marvel at water that strips the flesh from a man 's bones and then dissolves those bones to nothing . It 's a very good tale . I would n't change it for anything . " He reached out to grip the boy 's shoulder . " I would ask you to tell your father farewell for me , but I think perhaps you would do better not to let him know we saw each other . " Yosat nodded . " Thank you , minstrel . " " But there is one thing I will ask - a favor from you in return for that favor from me . " " Anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a boy on that island . He was sick for a long time , but he 's well now . Visit him . Play with him . He needs friends . " He smiled . " Perhaps someday you might even show him how to play ghost . " Then he turned and , with a wave of his hand , walked into the night . When he could no longer see them , looking back over his shoulder when their pale , moonlit shapes had been swallowed up by darkness and distance - he vanished in search of daylight , a fire to dry his clothes by , and a new lute .
