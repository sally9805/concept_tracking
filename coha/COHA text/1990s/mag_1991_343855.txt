Movie executives were n't wooing black filmmakers when Charles Burnett ( graduated from UCLA 's film school in 1974 . And Charles Lane did n't get many offers when he graduated from the film program at the State University of New York College at Purchase in 1980 . But that did n't stop either man from making movies . Lane went on to win a student Academy Award for best short in 1976 for A Place in Time , a 36-minute experimental film about a street artist ; 13 years later , he revived that film 's Chaplinesque hero in Sidewalk Stories , a silent feature that won the Prix du Publique Award at the Cannes Film Festival . Burnett 's first feature , Killer of Sheep , about a man who works in a slaughterhouse , was one of the first 50 films archived in the Library of Congress 's National Film Registry . <P> Until recently , however , neither director had much visibility outside film- festival circles . Burnett , who supported his family and his film projects with foundation grants and odd jobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now both are beginning to shake off the hothouse stigma . Lane , 37 , is making his big-budget debut in August with True Identity , a $16 million comedy about a black man forced to pass for white in order to evade Mafia hit men . Although he had to ask for changes that would make the movie less offensive to blacks , Lane admits he was thrilled when Disney 's Touchstone Pictures offered him the script . Says he : " I had been working in film since 1969 , so it was a long time coming . " <P> Burnett , 47 , appeared to get his big break last fall when the Samuel Goldwyn Co. released To Sleep with Anger , starring Danny Glover , a gentle modern-day folktale about a black Los Angeles family 's struggle to reconcile the desire for upward mobility with the traditions of their Southern past . " Today there is so much killing on the movie screens , and it prepares people to accept that kind of thing , " says Burnett . " I want to show a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival . " <P> Critics loved To Sleep with Anger , but there was little enthusiasm at the box office . Ironically , the film did better at art houses in predominantly white neighborhoods than in theaters in black neighborhoods . Burnett says Goldwyn 's limited advertising budget shortchanged the black community . He vows , however , to continue making intellectually challenging films . " I do n't want to seem pretentious , " he says , " but I think for society to progress , you have to add something . "
