It looked like an episode of roadside vengeance . About 30 miles southwest of the capital city of Kigali , four Tutsi , one of them a soldier of the victorious Rwandan Patriotic Front , stood around a Hutu man in his 50s . He was barefoot and dressed in a torn shirt and baggy pants . A dirty strip of blue- and-white fabric roped his elbows tight behind his back . His three young accusers shouted that the Hutu was a member of a militia group that had slaughtered Tutsi and political moderates earlier this year . They had seen him beat an old woman to death with a hoe , they yelled ; they had just come back to their town to find the Hutu still in his house , a free man . The suspect stared fixedly at the soldier , repeating over and over in a low voice , " I did n't kill anyone . I did n't kill anyone . " <P> At the R.P.F. checkpoint just up the road , the soldier handed the Hutu prisoner over to one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Was the man mistreated ? Was he killed ? That question writ large is preoccupying the whole of Rwanda . Are the Tutsi who now rule the country killing many , some , or any of the Hutu who have returned to their homes ? <P> There are plenty of rumors , but little hard evidence . Nevertheless , fear of Tutsi revenge for 500,000 murders keeps more than 2 million Rwandan refugees huddled in disease-ridden camps along the country 's borders . Some observers believe the horrifying stories are not just propaganda from defeated extremists of the Rwandan army . A U.N . relief official claims large numbers of Hutu are still fleeing from Rwanda : " They are scared of something , and it 's not other Hutu . " Two weeks ago , he says , U.N . aid workers driving near the border with Burundi saw about 50 bodies lying beside the road . " They were n't able to stop , " he says , " because there were so many R.P.F. soldiers around . " Last week a new wave of Hutu refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been secured by French troops . The French are pulling out Aug. 22 , and the Hutu are afraid the R.P.F. is preparing to exact vengeance ; relief officials fear a second mass exodus . <P> Only a few hundred refugees each day summon up the courage to leave the festering camps in Zaire to head the other way . Whatever might be happening out in the countryside , the trickle of Rwandans who reach Kigali enter a city of eerie quiet . Fewer than 100,000 of the 350,000 people who lived in the capital four months ago are there now . There is no electricity , no phone service , only partial water supply . Businesses and factories are shuttered . <P> Julie and Pascal Munyanziza and their two children , who had fled to the south , made the journey back to their tidy three-room house in a mixed Tutsi and Hutu section of Kigali . They found all the windows broken and much of the furniture gone , but the windows have been patched and the house now bears a handwritten sign : IYINZU BANYIRAYO BARAHARI ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark your house , " says Munyanziza , " someone will take it . "
