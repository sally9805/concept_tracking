All-New Camry The people at Toyota want the 1997 Camry to become the best-selling car in America . When it arrives at dealers in September , it is expected to have a $1500 price advantage over the Ford Taurus , the current passenger-car sales champion . Last year , the Taurus outsold the third-place Camry by only 37,664 units , so it appears that Toyota has a shot in ' ' 97 . This new Camry will still be built in Georgetown , Kentucky , but will be sold only as a sedan-the coupe and wagon models were discontinued to cut manufacturing costs . And the company reduced costs even more by eliminating the balance shafts from the base 4-cylinder engine . However , Toyota officials say the new engine will be just as smooth as the present Four . The current 3.0liter V6 will remain an option , but it will also be modified to reduce costs . The crankshaft for instance , will be " twisted " rather than . impressed during the forging process , which will reduce machining stock and cost less . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current three door seals to one seal , will distinguish the Camry from its upscale Lexus ES 300 brother , which will arrive in August . Infiniti 045 The name of Infiniti 's flagship will remain the same . The idea of dropping the " 45 " from Q45because the 4.5-liter V8 will no longer be used-has itself been dropped . The new car , which will be at dealers this fall , will use a 270-hp 4.1-liter V8 , but somebody at Infiniti thinks " Q41 " sounds like an industrial cleaner , so the car 's name will not be changed . The rest of it . however . is new . This mostly undisguised prototype shows conservative styling that bears a strong resemblance to that of Acura 's 3.2TL . Although the grille is missing its chrome slats , and there 's some tape hiding the corners of both the headlights and taillights , you can see that the taillights wrap around the quarter panels and that the headlights have integrated turn signals . The new Q45 also has MercedesBenz-type pull door handles . It may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the LS 400 . Subaru Streega With Subaru 's dependence on allwheel-drive to move its cars , it 's odd that the company has never had a purpose-built sport/utility . But soon , however , its Streega will take on the Toyota RAV4 , Honda CR-V , Suzuki Sidekick and Kia Sportage in the about-to-boil mini-sport/utility market , and will be the Japanese maker 's first . A little shorter nose to tail and higher to the roof than the Legacy , the Streega uses unitbody construction like the RAV4 and the Jeep Grand Cherokee . Look for the Streega at Subaru dealers in about a year . More Sport/Utilities Mitsubishi and Infiniti both have new SUVs in the works . Mitsubishi 's will be smaller than its existing Montero , which will carry on . The new truck will be about the size of an Isuzu Rodeo , and will look like a cross between a Rodeo and the new Toyota 4Runner . A 2.4- liter 4-cylinder will be standard , l and an sohc 3.0-liter V6 will be optional . Expect pricing in the $17,000 to $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STREEGA // Infiniti 's entry is a version of the new Nissan Pathfinder , and it will arrive this fall . Named the QX4 , it will butt heads with the Acura SLX and Lexus LX 450 . The QX4 will be powered by the Pathfinder 's 168-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 engine . Inflniti At Indy Nissan will supply engines to the Indy Racing League Series for the 1997 racing season . Like Oldsmobile 's Aurora V8 , which is already committed to the IRL , Nissan 's 4.0-liter IRL engine will be derived from a street engine . The " Infiniti Indy " will come from the Infiniti Q45 's 32-valve V8 . Two More Electrics Both Honda and Toyota will sell electric vehicles in California in the near future . Honda will be first . Beginning next spring , the Honda EV will be available for lease through select dealers within Southern California and Sacramento . Honda hopes to lease 300 EVs over the next few years . Although very Civic-esque , Honda says the EV is not a conversion of an existing model and that 95% of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered by nickel-metal-hydride batteries and a single-speed transmission , which Honda claims gives the EV a range of 125 miles and a top speed of more than 80 mph . Acceleration to 60 mph for the 3593-pound car is a very sleepy 18.7 seconds , however . Recharging takes 8 hours and a 220-volt outlet . Inside are all the comforts of an ordinary Civic : antilock brakes , dual airbags , a/c , keyless remote entry , CD stereo and power windows , door locks , mirrors and steering . Photograph HONDA EV Photograph TOYOTA RAV4-EV // Toyota 's RAV4-EV , up for lease only to fleet buyers beginning in 1998 , is also powered by a nickel-metalhydride battery pack . Toyota says the 3373-pound electric RAV4 can hit 79 mph and travel 120 miles on a charge . The RAV4-EV does use a unique 220-volt , 40-amp conductive charging system and carries its charger on-board , eliminating the need for additional equipment . Yet , it also requires 6 to 8 hours to recharge . Red-Hot 240SX With the 300ZX gasping its last breath , Nissan may look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void . The guys at Nissan Motorsports turned up the wick on a 240SX SE to see what can be done to this rear-wheel-drive coupe . They added Eibach progressive-rate springs , adjustable shocks , a stiff NISMO rear sway bar and 17-in . Panasport G5 wheels wrapped in Yokohama AVS rubber measuring 235/45 front and 255/40 rear . The resulting ride makes your teeth chatter , but it handles like a slot car . The 155hp 2.4-liter 4-cylinder , however , just does n't have the yank to break those big tires loose , which limits the car 's fun factor . The K &N; air filter and the HKS muffler with its Kong-like 5-in.dia. pipe help , but they 're not enough . Other tweaks include cross-drilled front rotors and 4-piston calipers from a Nissan Skyline GTR ( a model sold only in Japan ) , and a Momo carbon-fiber shift knob .
