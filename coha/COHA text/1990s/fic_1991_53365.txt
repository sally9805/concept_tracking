Contents2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 # 1 <p> Half awake , pawing at the night table for The Book of Great Conversations , I knock the bottle onto the floor . The sound hangs there : there 's a ringing part of it and a shattering part of it and a splashing part of it . I smell the gin . Well , it can stay there until I feel like getting up . Nobody here to be scandalized , nobody to be protected . A mouse , I suppose , might scamper across and cut its dainty foot , but that 's the mouse 's lookout , no ? I remember we felt sorry at first for the bright-eyed mice who started appearing a month after we 'd moved in . So tiny , so dear : could n't we all just live ? It took another month for you to agree that " something "  --  your word  --  had to be done . Like what , I said , a resettlement program ? Well , could n't we ? you said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bought the Hav-a-Heart trap . That was only last fall . Less than a year ago . As I remember it , we were all right then . <p> Kid noise through the open window . Sunday morning , quarter to eleven , already hot . I lift the sheet and shake it out to make it feel cool as it floats back down to rest on my legs . The feeling does n't last . I prop both pillows ( yours and mine ) together against the headboard , sit up , put on my prescription sunglasses and turn to the Great Conversation in which Shaw loses his temper when Chesterton calls him a Puritan . Shaw says Chesterton has no real self , no firm place to stand , and Chesterton calls Shaw a Puritan for thinking that was necessary . Trying to understand these ideas is waking me up . I put the book back on the night table  --  carefully now that there 's no reason to be careful  --  get out of bed and , trying not to step on glass , go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Down in the street they 've put a sprinkler cap on the hydrant. otherwise the Dominicans just open it up and let it gush . So these pencil-thick streams of water come arching out and a little boy stands at the edge of the widening puddle , undecided . <p> But hang on : had n't I left the car in that first space to the right of the hydrant ? What 's there now is a rusted-out station wagon , cloudy plastic duct-taped to where the passenger window used to be . So I 've found out one more thing : they tow you after a week of tickets . Well , fine , more power to ' em . Unless of course somebody stole the thing to part it out . In which case fine , too . But is n't it weird . You were always the one who said it was crazy to keep a car in New York . I was always the one who said I wanted the feeling I could get out . <p> 2 And your going off to Minneapolis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and get out of the heat and the noise , spend some time with my brother . We sat around his house mostly  --  Joey was still depressed about throwing away his marriage  --  though one day we did get over into Vermont , to a used bookstore run by a lady with cats . Joey beat her down on the price of some old mythology book he wanted for the illustrations ; to atone , I picked The Book of Great Conversations off the twenty-five-cent table and told her it was off the dollar table . The odd pairings  --  Goethe and Napoleon , Stalin and H.G. Wells  --  made it seem better than it fumed out to be . <p> He called yesterday , speaking of Joey , to say he was doing a lot better . I said I was doing a lot worse : that you had gone to live in Boston , that I had n't been out of the apartment for a week , had n't called work , did n't know if I had a job anymore and even if I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing Kate every day . I said the goddamn sirens keep you awake all night long . Car alarms and shit . Kate , he said : refresh me . I refreshed him . Hm , he said . Listen , I said , the Kate thing had all been discussed . Worked through . Resolved . Hm , he said . Well , he said , as far as the job , they were probably just assuming I was taking two weeks instead of the one and if they were seriously upset they would have called , no ? He said he was sorry about your leaving , but guessed he 'd seen it coming when we 'd been up there at Christmas . What do you mean , I said , why was that ? He said , For one thing , you never touched each other . He said <p> speaking as somebody who 'd been through the same thing he knew I was going to come out of this stronger . Said at least in my case there were no children . Said maybe I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the outer Banks for two weeks for a mad interlude with his old used-to-be , she ends up going back to her husband ( many tears ) , he comes home and Meg and the children are gone . And now he discovers there are no great new women in Peterborough , New Hampshire . The night I got up there he tried to talk me into getting back in the car and driving down to Boston . Some idea of picking up college girls : just as big as real women , he said , but stupider . <p> " Joey , " I said . " I just drove five hours . " <p> " So I 'll drive and you can sleep on the way down . Listen , " he said , " I got a teensy thing of coke left . And we can absolutely get more once we get there . Fuck , let 's do some coke , you want to ? " <p> But as of yesterday he 'd gotten the north side of the house painted , which really needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd got the roof all patched in the woodshed . Said he 'd probably just needed some physical exercise : said it makes a tremendous difference . Said he 'd started a new series of silk screens which were absolutely going to be the best things since those ducks he was doing a couple of years ago . They 're going to be  --  whatever the plural is of phoenix . But getting back to my thing : said he 'd always said that Gordon Conway was scum and he was glad at least that now everybody would see it . Said as it turned out he guessed it had been a good thing I 'd talked him out of going into Boston that night . He 'd been going to hit Gordon up since Gordon generally kept enough coke around to sell , and it would 've been incredibly disastrous if we 'd knocked on the door and so on . Said he thought you might come back once the dust had a chance to settle . If that was what we both wanted . Said it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love theft ; <p> 3 Or something . I remember speaking the vows and thinking , Maybe . <p> The day before , we 'd had that huge thing about whether Meg 's sister should be at the ceremony . " What am I supposed to do , " I said , " turn around at this point and disinvite her ? You know , she drives down with them , thinking everything is cool , and  --  I mean , Janey , this was , literally , years ago . She is now a friend I mean , what should I have done , not told you ? " <p> " Yes , " you said . Then you said , " No . " Then you began to cry . <p> But then there were the times when , deferring to my choice of a film or a restaurant , you used to take my hand and kiss it like a courtier . What were the proportions of sweetness and irony ? Not that I ever wanted to pick it apart . At first . This gesture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago : that Saturday when you wanted to go down and hit one of the Indian joints on Sixth Street and I wanted to go someplace where we could count on its being air-conditioned . In retrospect , this last handkiss makes me wonder when exactly you and Gordon Conway had made your arrangements . Though that 's not all it makes me wonder . <p> As far as I know , you had n't met him before this spring , when you went up to Boston for Lynnette 's show . The three of you at lunch . At some health-food place . Which all seemed fine . A friend of your friend Lynnette 's . ( This was the weekend Kate and I broke our rule about each other 's apartments . We rented Syberberg 's Parsifal , though we only got through the overture and the first act , and we ordered in from the good Chinese place . ) I remembered him , of course , from when he 'd gone to Pratt with Joey and I decided not to be gratuitously unpleasant by saying he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of person who 'd fasten onto Lynette or vice versa . This must have been in April . Now at that point I assume you were telling me everything , or why would you have told me even that much ? Well , maybe to preclude my hearing it from somebody else . Or maybe just to get some relief . I can sympathize . I made a point of telling you what sounded like everything : how Kate and I on hands and knees had extracted misfed paper from the innards of that chronically misbehaving Xerox machine , how " I " had rented Parsifal , how Armin Jordan had lip-synched so undetectably as Amfortas . Such truths , told forthrightly , kept the rest of the truth away : while telling them , I could almost believe that Kate was just the funny woman who worked two offices down . With the husband who sounded so interesting . <p> Now the next thing I heard about your new friend Gordon was the following week : he and Lynnette were going to be in New York and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , at which to get myself on record . " As you know , " I said , " Lynnette is not one of my favorite people . And I truly dislike Gordon Conway . " <p> " He speaks well of you , " you said . <p> " He 's a ferret , " I said . " Are he and Lynnette an item ? <p> You said nothing . <p> " So where 's dinner ? " I said . " Elaine 's ? " <p> You put down your glass . " What 's this about ? " <p> " Or hey , " I said , " there 's always the East Village . You know , down there where the real artists hang out . Now me , there 's nothing I like better than real artists , you know ? Being real . Should I buy a beret for the occasion ? " <p> " I thought you were n't going . " <p> " Are you ? " I said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Grazie , " you said , and picked up your glass . " I intend to . " <p> 4 And then nothing ( meaning nothing I was told about ) until two weeks ago . A Sunday morning . Me at the kitchen table , drinking coffee . <p> " I 've got it , " you called when the phone rang . Then you came out of the bedroom . I asked if you 'd turned off the fan in there . You said you had to go to Minneapolis . <p> " Why ? " I said . " What 's up ? " <p> " Marie , " you said . " She was in a car wreck . She died this morning . " <p> " What ? " I said . <p> " Look , I have to pack . Will you please call a cab ? La Guardia , tell him . " <p> " Jesus , " I said . " Oh my God . Listen , I think we better take the car instead . Stick it in the long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know ? Without moving it . " <p> You shook your head . " You 're not coming , " you said . <p> " Janey . Come on . " <p> " Will you just please call the cab ? " <p> " Janey . " <p> " Okay , fine , " you said . " Then I will call the cab . " You hauled down the Yellow Pages and made a show of leafing through . <p> " The hell is going on ? " I said . " I 'm coming with you . " <p> " You see my family once a year , " you said . " At Thanksgiving . That 's a grand total of five times . And once et the wedding . " <p> " This is completely batshit , " I said . " I 'm your husband . " You rolled your eyes . " Listen , " I said . " If absolutely nothing else , there 's the proprieties . It would be incredibly disrespectful to your mother for me not to show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you said . " She 's not expecting you . You 're so concerned with the proprieties , sit down and write her a note . Truly . I 'll hand-deliver it . " You went back into the bedroom and shut the door . I followed you , wondering if at a time like this I should be asking what this everything-is-fucked business was about . or were you entitled to slip stuff in and not be called on it because your sister was dead ? <p> I ended up agreeing to everything : not to come , not to call , to let you breathe . Not to upset your mother by sending flowers . If I 'd given you more of an argument , would you have broken down and confessed ? Such a bizarre lie argues that you wanted me to see through it . So : one more time I failed you . But you made it convincing . So : one more time you arranged for me to fail you . While you packed , I wrote a draft of the thing for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Address . Then I copied it over cleanly , keeping my head to the side so drops of sweat would n't fall on the good notepaper . I wonder what you ended up doing with it . <p> After helping you down with your stuff , I came back upstairs , made more coffee , and decided to call in the next morning and take the week off . I 'd like to think I 'd planned to spend some of the time thinking about Us instead of just hanging out up at Joey 's drinking wine at his kitchen table . But I must have known it was really just a holiday . Your sister had laid down her life ( as I thought ) so I could have a week off from you . <p> 5 I got back from Joey 's on Thursday night . You called on Friday , around noon : you were coming in on American , seven o'clock . " I 'll be glad to see you , " I said . " How 's your mother making it ' How are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , " you said . <p> At seven o'clock I watched stranger after stranger after stranger come down the carpeted passageway . You came up behind me and said , " Hi . " <p> " Hi , " I said . " I do n't get this . How could I have missed you ? " <p> " Been here since five , " you said . <p> " You 're kidding , " I said . " Why did n't you call me ? " Then I smelled your breath . " Well , " I said , " I can see you 've used the time to advantage . " <p> " The American Advantage , " you said . " Now I have the advantage . " <p> " Shall we ? " I said , and took your suitcase . You followed like a little girl who had been bad . I turned around and said , " Have you eaten anything ? Do you want to stop someplace ? " <p> " Want to go home , " you said , your head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what there is there , but there 's probably something . " <p> " You do n't want to talk with me , " you said . <p> It was the second-to-last of our silent car rides : me sitting thinking of ways to open a conversation and imagining how you 'd parry each one , you sitting thinking God knows what . I thought , I am so tired of all this . And then I thought how unfair it was of me to think that after you 'd just lost your sister . As I thought . You were looking good , despite the shape you were in . Your cheeks pale , your lips fat . It was the first thing I had felt for you sexually since our confrontation over Kate . I decided to be angry instead . You showed better sense : when we got upstairs and I put down your suitcase to unlock the door , you reached for my belt . To my credit , I was gracious . <p> 6 On Saturday afternoon , you were out grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the voice , " it 's Marie . Is Jane around ' Listen , when are you guys ever going to come see me ? " <p> " Who is this ? " I said . " Goddamn it , who the fuck is this ? " <p> When you came in , I said : " Marie called . " <p> " Oh , " you said . " Well . " You shook your head . " Actually I 'm surprised it took this long . But  --  " You shrugged . " It must have been pretty awkward for you . What did you end up saying ? " <p> " Why ? " I said . " Why would you be so stupid ? I mean , beyond stupid . " <p> " Sometimes you feel like being stupid , what can I say ? " you said . " Did n't you ever want to just be stupid ? " You went into the kitchen . <p> I followed . " So where were you ? " I said . " obviously you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . Who was the lucky man ? " <p> " Why do you assume it was just one lucky man ? " you said . You set the bag down on the counter and turned to face me . " Oh Rick , I ca n't go on living a lie , " you said , clamping the edge of the countertop behind you and hopping up to sit . " The truth is , it was all of your dear friends . It was Stefan and Andy and Alex  --  oh , and Gregory . Dear Gregory . oh , but see , now there I go lying again . " <p> " Okay , forget it , " I said . " I mean , I 'm through anyway . I truly am . " <p> You hopped down and gripped both my arms . " Rick , " you said . " I need your compassion at this terrible moment . The truth is , it was n't a man  --  it was a woman . In fact , you wo n't believe this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just found we had so much in common that we decided to have gay women 's sex . " You started giggling . " Rick , Rick , you must believe me . " <p> " You 're stoned , " I said . <p> " Oh yes , Rick , I am stoned . You 're so perspicacious , always . The truth is , I 'm hooked on cocaine . " <p> " Fine , " I said . " You do n't want to talk , fine . " <p> " Oh Rick , you do understand . " Your fingernails dug into my arms and you lifted your head and kissed my cheek so hard I felt teeth . Then you let go and slapped and my glasses went flying . We looked at each other . You were red-faced and breathing hard . I was thinking : <p>  --  I am sick to death of every aspect of this .  --  I ca n't walk out with her in this kind of shape .  --  This will never end .  --  I will take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this from a great distance . Then you began to sob and I took you in my arms and patted your back again and again , and smoothed and smoothed your hair , thinking : <p> Every minute of this is a minute out of my life . <p> When you finally went into the bathroom to wash your face I went and picked up my glasses . A Y-shaped crack in the left lens . I tried to think how to hide from you the evidence of what you yourself had done : all I could do was not put them back on . Then it seemed to me you were taking too long in there . The water had stopped running long ago . Cutting your wrists ? Not easy with a Good News razor . Swallowing the whole thing of Sudafed ? I could save your life by breaking down the door . But I would have to ask first if you were all right , and that might enrage you  --  might in fact be the thing that would make you suicidal . The thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head , to get the right tone : " Hey , Janey ? I 'm going to need to use the john pretty soon . " If you answered I 'd know you were all right ; if you did n't I 'd know that you were either not all right or sulking . But of course you 'd see through it . So I waited and worried . As you either did or did n't know . <p> Finally you came out and sat on the sofa hugging yourself , your feet tucked under you . " I 'm sorry , " you said . " I am completely humiliated . And I need very much not to talk right now . I 'm very confused at this point . " <p> " You 're confused ? <p> " Please , " you said . " Would you do something ? Would you please pretend with me , just for a while ? Like until tomorrow ? Can we just pretend we 're all right ' one more day ? " <p> 8 The way we managed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I lost track of you . We called the good Chinese place for cold hacked chicken and cold sesame noodles and I found my old prescription sunglasses in the drawer and we sat on the bed in our underwear and watched an old Jackie Gleason variety show on cable . It seemed to me the show was about a fat unhappy man who dressed himself up on Saturday night to watch things happen around him . The orchestra leader was named Sammy Spear , and I pounded the mattress and said , " God , it 's too perfect . That one 's the spear and that one 's the open wound . Look at him  --  he 's the open wound . He 's the walking wounded . " <p> " You 're the walking drunk , " you said , in the old way . <p> " I 'm not walking , " I said . " Lying right here . Too goddamn , too goddamn smart , to think about trying to walk . " <p> 9 Sunday morning , catnapping . I opened my eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh against mine , opened my eyes again , saw it was ten minutes later , closed them again . Wanted to keep on and on . Then I woke up and you were n't beside me . I looked around the room : there you were , at the dresser , bareback , in underpants . I imagined a steely look on your face and closed my eyes again . But my head hurt and I could n't get back down into sleep . When I opened my eyes you turned around . Your large , flat nipples . You came and took your watch off the night table and strapped it on . It was the look I 'd imagined , more or less . <p> You said , " I 'm going to pack some things , you know ? And then I 'm going to go . okay ? " <p> " Go where ? " I said . " Would you please tell me what the fuck is going on ? " <p> " Please do n't be stupid , " you said . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then closed my eyes before you pulled it over your head . " I do n't want to go through this day , " I said . <p> " Ees not my puddoblem , " you said . " Listen , I think you 're going to do just fine out of this . If your platonic friend and co-worker Kate wo n't take you back , you can always find another platonic friend and co-worker . And another one and another one You know , until you find the right one . Now you just lie there , go back to sleep , and when you wake up  --  presto . Wifey just an unpleasant memory . " <p> " Where are you going ? " I said . I opened my eyes . You were pulling on a pair of jeans . <p> " To Unpleasant Memoryland . Poof . " You raised your palm to your lips and blew . <p> " Where are you going ? " <p> You zipped the zipper and gave me the look again . " Boston , " you said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a deep breath and let it out . " Oh , " I said . <p> You shrugged . <p> " He 's a lowlife I said . <p> " He 's not that bad , " you said . " Fact , he 's a little like you in some ways . At any rate , he 's probably not forever . " <p> " So then what ? " <p> " Ees not your puddoblem , " you said , sitting on the bed to put on your running shoes . " Look , I promise you , this will be very easy . I do n't want money , I do n't want any of the stuff except for my grandfather 's chair which I 'll come get at some point . I guess I want the little rug that 's in the other room . My books . You can keep the VCR . I 'll let you know when I 'm coming . And I will call Marie tonight , to spare you any further embarrassment . okay ? " You picked up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Robert DeNiro voice , " Don ' worr ' . I take care ev'ryt'ing . " <p> " I ca n't believe this , " I said . <p> " Look , " you said , " I have to crank it , you know ? If I 'm going to make this plane . " <p> " Could I at least drive you to the airport ? " I said . " And we could talk on the way ? I really need to understand what 's going on . " <p> You sighed . " Sure . Fine , what the hell . But I do n't know what you think you have to understand . Your bad wife is leaving you . For another man . You 're a wronged husband . Now you can be happy . " <p> 10 I pull the shade back down and go into the kitchen to find the phone book . The number for Towaways is busy . Eight million stories in the Naked City . I pull off some paper towels to mop up the gin and take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingerly , remembering I 'm in a stressful period . They go into a paper bag which goes into an empty Tropicana carton which goes into the trash so no one gets hurt . <p> Since Kate was n't about to leave her husband and I was n't about to leave you , she and I had agreed to be careful . out of consideration . No hang-up calls , no leaving the office together , no being at each other 's places even if it seemed perfectly safe , no overnighters anywhere . But you and I had rules , too , though never codified : the gist was that we were n't to go looking for what we did n't want to see . You were the one who violated that rule , by following me into the subway at lunch hour , riding in the next car to West Fourth Street , walking a block behind me to Kate 's sister 's building and watching from a phone booth as I was buzzed in . I was the one who was trying to protect you . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ingenious , the way the trapdoor would fall away from under the mouse when he went for the bait and tumble him into the metal box . " We could take and release them in Central Park , " you said . " By the zoo . Plenty of warm places for a mousie to hang out . " <p> The next day , I got home before you did . I went into the kitchen and opened the thing to check , and there was a mouse : twitching , squealing , hopelessly wedged into a corner between sharp edges of galvanized metal . He had tried to worm himself out through a place where the box had n't been put together quite right . I watched for a second , then went looking for something . Best thing I could find was a screwdriver : I pressed the tip of it into his neck until I felt a snap . Then I hid him at the bottom of the trash , wrapped in the paper towel I 'd used to wipe the inside of the box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was useless . <p> " It 's only been a day , " you said . <p> " Right , " I said . " But . one of them already managed to take the bait and get away . We 're either going to have to get D-Con or put up with the mice . or get a cat . " <p> You shook your head . " Rick , you know I 'm allergic to cats . " You sighed . " I do n't know , " you said . " I guess we ca n't put up with mice , can we ? I mean they do carry disease , right ? " As in The Book of Great Conversations , the things we said to each other would have sounded ordinary , most of them , to anyone who did n't know the story . <p> A week ago , at just this time of day , we were on our way to La Guardia . I asked you what last weekend had been about : why had it been necessary for you to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . I pressed you  --  it seemed wrong not to press you  --  but I was thinking , Why not just admit you 're relieved ? All that traffic must have been people heading for the beaches . Sun glinting off windshields and bumpers . We were n't moving fast enough to get a breeze going and my shirt was soaked through . Shifting from low to second and back to low . Good I had the sunglasses . I remember passing a black van with an orange volcano painted on its side panel , then the van passing us . Its windows were up and the driver , a bland thug , was singing away unheard , beating time on the steering wheel , as his girlfriend painted her nails . When we finally got there you let me park and carry your suitcase as far as security . I put it on the moving belt , you put your pocketbook next to it and turned to me before stepping into the frame . <p> " Bye , " you said . <p> " This is really it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your forefinger and raised your chin . I cupped my hands like parentheses around your shoulders and bent to kiss at least your forehead . You laid a hand on my cheek , pushed my head to the side , and whispered in my ear , " This is what you wanted . " <p> <p> By David Gates <p>
