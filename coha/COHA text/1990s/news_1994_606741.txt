<p> Get off the Metro in Bethesda , and you see high-rise office buildings . At the Rockville station , Montgomery County 's administrative complex greets you . <p> But go all the way to the end of the Red Line , to Shady Grove , and across the street you 'll see hundreds of acres of rolling farmland . It 's the King Farm , a piece of the rural past in the midst of suburbia . <p> The 440-acre farm is really a lot more than that . It is regarded as one of the most potentially lucrative suburban development sites around , and it 's also among the most troubled : The land is mired in debt and the King heirs face a foreclosure auction Sept. 27 . <p> How did such a valuable property end up so close to the auction block ? It 's a mixture of government actions , family tensions and market forces , according to those familiar with the situation . <p> " It 's difficult to assess a fair market value for the tract , as there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's one of the most valuable pieces of land on the East Coast , " said Jon A. Gerson , director of the Montgomery County Office of Economic Development . <p> Under the county 's master plan the property could hold 3,200 homes , 100,000 square feet of retail stores and 3.5 million square feet of office and other employment space  --  almost as much as the Pentagon . It 's one of three sites in the county under consideration for a major federal construction project for the Food and Drug Administration . <p> For decades the King Farm  --  sometimes called the Irvington Farm  --  was a working dairy , the heart of W. Lawson King 's fortune . King was one of the pioneers of modern Montgomery County , eventually owning about 1,000 acres , the King Pontiac automobile dealership and other businesses . Over his lifetime he sold off hundreds of acres to the developers who built homes , stores and offices for the county 's burgeoning population . But he also said he wanted the " home farm " to remain undeveloped during his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreclosure started in 1982 , three years before King 's death , when he sold the King Farm for $ 596,942.95 to his three grown children , William I. King , Elizabeth Jeanne Jacobs and Fannie Lois Aschenbach , all of whom still live in Montgomery County . <p> Presumably , King intended to minimize his taxes , as he was not a man who enjoyed paying the Internal Revenue Service . In the 1940s he staged a high-profile but unsuccessful one-man protest against Montgomery County 's personal property tax . And a letter from a onetime family lawyer , evidence in a later lawsuit , quotes him saying about the sale of the farm : " Even if there is only one penny in taxes involved I want the whole transaction canceled  --  and immediately . " <p> But the tax problems the sale caused the family were immense . The IRS maintained that the purchase price was too low , that the farm was worth at least $ 100 million . The children settled with the IRS in 1988 , agreeing to pay $ 20 million in gift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Maryland Farm Credit , a Frederick-based cooperative that is part of the federally sponsored Farm Credit System . Most of the money was to pay the IRS ; the rest was to cover interest costs during the loan 's three-year term . The money was due in 1992 , but was never paid back . Interest keeps accruing on it and a separate loan of $ 2.2 million , bringing the total amount owed today to $ 42 million . <p> Ken Goldberg , a real estate broker with Carey Winston Co. , is handling the sale for Central Maryland Farm Credit . The co-op has , he said , " tried for quite a while to work out deals that have been presented to them by the family , and have been unsuccessful . They have no alternative . The loan is in default . " He would n't speculate on whether the auction might be postponed . <p> To keep the land , the family would like to find " an angel , " an outside investor who could help , said Rex L. Sturm , a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of situation does n't bring out angels . " <p> As far as the owners are concerned , the timing of the auction is miserable , Sturm said . <p> The tract is one of three in Montgomery County under consideration as the site for major research facilities for the Food and Drug Administration . If the FDA bought the land , the family would be out from under its massive debt . But the government wo n't decide until December which of the three sites to buy , said Rose Rita Douds , a General Services Administration spokeswoman . <p> The decision could be worth $ 100 million or more for the winning landowner , according to the best guess of industry experts . <p> Sturm said , " We think the filing of the foreclosure is an extremely unfortunate decision . It should not be done . But we 're trying to deal with it . We are hopeful that something will come up that will at least postpone the foreclosure . " <p> But at least some of the King family 's problems are self-inflicted  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . According to their lawyers , family members prefer not to comment on this or other issues related to the land . The lawyers say any disagreements within the family have had no bearing on the situation . <p> Many who talked about the case cited tensions among the heirs , but few would attach their names to their statements . <p> " There are three children , and each has a unique perspective on the best use of the site , " Gerson said diplomatically . <p> The uneasy relations that so many mention do n't seem to be the stuff of epics , but rather the kind of discomfort that exists in many families . A store of bad feelings has built up over the years over personal disagreements , according to many who are familiar with the family members . <p> The discord has affected how they have handled the decade-plus mess over their farm : They did n't make certain kinds of improvements that could be attractive to buyers , like building access roads , because they could n't agree what to spend , one acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up business deals with them because there 's no single person who can be assumed to speak for everyone . <p> " The family themselves have some differences of opinion . Some of their decision-making processes are not very cordial , " said Joseph P. Blocher , whose law firm at one point represented the family in zoning matters . <p> The three children grew up on the family farm , and all three continue to live nearby . The eldest , William I. King , 72 , once managed the farm for his father , and still lived there until recently , when he and his wife moved elsewhere in Gaithersburg . He also owns farmland in Georgia , managed by a grandson , but not exclusively to grow crops : " Billy King grows town houses , " one acquaintance said . <p> Elizabeth Jeanne Jacobs , 66 , married a school administrator . The youngest sister , Lois Aschenbach , 59 , married a car dealer , who runs the auto business her father founded . Neither sister had a business career outside the home . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 10 children and 18 grandchildren among them . <p> If they lose the farm , " I do n't think any of them is going to be on the street begging , " one source said . <p> King , Jacobs and their children control a partnership that owns a two-thirds interest in the land . Aschenbach and her children control a separate partnership that owns the other third . <p> How the family will act in the next two weeks is unknown . In similar circumstances , many debtors file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection , which can halt a foreclosure auction . Sturm would n't say whether his clients have considered that move . <p> The two lawyers for the family members , who represent two sets of heirs , played down the differences . William Canby , who represented the Aschenbach interests until his death Sept. 4 , said in an interview last month , " To say the property owners have disagreed over how the property should be developed  --  I do n't think that 's a fair statement . " <p> Sturm , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get into any large family , you will get into differences of opinion , as anyone knows . But I do n't think that 's what 's caused this thing to get in this position . " <p> Sturm and others cite Montgomery County 's master planning process , which several years ago radically changed the ways the land could be used . <p> The King Farm remains zoned agricultural , which results in low property tax rates , but county plans envision much denser uses . <p> Under a 1977 master plan the entire tract was designated a massive industrial park . But by the late 1980s , the county 's thinking about land use had changed . The process that resulted in the 1990 master plan , which calls for mixed commercial and residential development on the King Farm , took place in a political atmosphere of " slow growth "  --  a belief that unrestrained development was bad . <p> " Montgomery County is extremely careful and controlled , more so probably than any other jurisdiction , " said R. Robert Linowes , Blocher 's partner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been any major overbuilding ; there have n't been many failed projects . The atmosphere for development is strict and confining , but nonetheless often turns out to be advantageous . " <p> Still , there can be conflicts between planners and landowners . Canby said that government impeded his clients ' ability to develop their land , which could have let them pay off their loan years ago . " Government nowadays has a managed-growth philosophy . The government in its wisdom  --  whether I approve or do n't approve of that wisdom  --  the government has kept development from progressing , " he said last month . <p> But the county did not want to halt all future development on the land , just certain kinds . " The idea was to get a mix of housing and commercial uses at a fairly high density because it 's close to Metro , " said John Carter , coordinator for urban design at the planning commission . <p> " It 's probably more ' realistic zoning ' than it is ' downzoning , ' " Carter said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have allowed so much office space that there would never be a market for it , he said . " Yes , if you calculate what the zoning produces , it 's a little less , but if you put it together realistically in developable parcels , it 's a major , major opportunity . " <p> In search of a friendlier government atmosphere , the family petitioned in 1991 to have its land annexed from the unincorporated county into the city of Rockville . That action is pending . <p> But it was n't just the planning process , which took two years , that stalled development . During that time , recession struck , and the real estate market collapsed . The commercial market , in particular , collapsed after years of overbuilding regionally and nationally . With bankruptcies more common than new developments , it was tough to find anyone interested in buying yet more land . <p> Still , in 1992 , with the loan due , the family found a buyer for part of its land : Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the retail chain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly across from a Metro stop did not fit into the master plan . Its traffic would have been car-oriented rather than Metro-oriented , and the store would have been more than twice the total retail space the plan envisions . The necessary zoning change was denied . <p> Whatever role government and family have had so far , the next steps are up to the market . <p> The FDA , which with the help of the GSA has been shopping for a new Maryland location for years , is the most immediate prospect . <p> " There 's very little you can depend on GSA for other than that they 'll take more time than they say , and there 's no certainty they 'll do anything , " said John Kyle , a broker with the real estate firm of Julien J. Studley Inc. , who specializes in land sales and has been involved with GSA deals . <p> An auction would not affect the FDA decision , the GSA 's Douds said . The government itself would not bid at auction , she said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The land 's not going away . It 's just a new owner . " <p> While it 's likely the land will eventually be developed even if FDA chooses another site , that probably wo n't happen soon . <p> " There are few players in the current real estate market that have the resources to buy 400 acres of land and build 2.5 million square feet , " Gerson said . " The FDA consolidation is offering an opportunity to one of the site owners that is not likely to come along again in the near future . " <p> That 's not to say there will be no bidders if there is an auction  --  though if there were n't any , Central Maryland Farm Credit would get the title and presumably would sell the land itself at some point . And Goldberg said the nationally advertised auction already has attracted a lot of investor interest . <p> But the uncertainty over the FDA 's move and the potential for development make it difficult to put a value on the land , Kyle said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's that basic . " <p> And , he said , with the office market as weak as it is , it could take decades to build out the parcel . An owner would have to have the resources to wait . " If you 're counting heads of cattle rather than counting heads of people , it has less value , " he said . <p> An auction would take the land out of the hands of the King family , which has owned some of it since 1924 . " It would be a tragedy if the King family were not the beneficiaries of their father 's estate , " Gerson said . <p> Blocher said : " Between the family 's disagreement and the FDA never coming , and the debt accumulating , and now they 're on the auction block : It 's just sad , sad , sad .
