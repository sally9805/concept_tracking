<p> WHILE most members of the Sanford ( Maine ) High School marching band were playing music at a state band competition earlier this winter , nine members were secretly tripping on LSD . <p> School officials eventually suspended the band members . But state officials saw the incident as a wake-up call . " What we are seeing in Maine , " says Sgt. George Connick , a supervisor at the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency , " is a moderate increase in the use of LSD among young people . " <p> In this case , as Maine goes , so goes the nation . Use of LSD , the illicit hallucinatory drug synonymous with the 1960s , is now reported to be slowing rising among youths in national and state drug surveys and reports . <p> The United States Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) goes further . It calls LSD ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) " the fastest growing drug of abuse among the under-20 age group . " <p> A recent report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) surveyed 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug experiencing the " sharpest increase , " but the report concluded that " LSD and hallucinogens other than LSD ... also continued to drift upward . " <p> In 1991 , 2.7 percent of eighth- graders had used LSD . Last year , that figure rose to 4.4 percent . The proportion of eighth-graders taking any illicit drug has grown since 1991 from 11 percent to 21 percent . <p> Almost all experts agree today that LSD , inhalants , marijuana , cigarettes , and alcohol are being used by more and more children at younger ages . All drug use is up among kids in junior high and below , and it has edged up again in the past three years among 12th-graders . <p> The NIDA study , conducted by the University of Michigan annually for the last 21 years , indicated that the proportion of all students regarding drugs as dangerous continued to decline in 1995 . Other studies indicate that LSD is often perceived more as an exciting stimulant than as a drug with potential harm . <p> Yet there were reports last year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recently , a 16-year-old in Barnstable , Mass. , died after " acute psychosis " induced by LSD , according to a medical examiner . <p> What particularly bothers observers now is the increasing frequency of LSD use . <p> " The disturbing factor is that LSD is taken now on a much more frequent basis by those who use it , " says Jim Hall , executive director of Up Front Information Center , a drug research center in Miami , Fla . " With a lower dose level , we hear of far more regular use , even daily use by some students . " <p> Social scientists say that the national increase in the use of LSD stems from several causes . First , the drug is relatively cheap . A small dose of LSD can be bought for as low as $ 3 . Second , a decade ago there was more attention in the media about the consequences of drug abuse , and more antidrug ads . Third , many teens are not informed by parents about drugs . <p> According to the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more likely than today 's parents to talk to their children about drugs , because more of today 's parents actually used drugs when they were teens and may feel hypocritical telling their teens not to use ( them ) . " <p> The LSD of today generally tends to be less potent than the " acid " used in the 1960s and ' 70s . While the drug is not considered to be physically addictive , like cocaine or heroin , it can become a drug of dependency for some users . <p> " This is not a drug that is usually identified with dramatic , emergency-room conditions with an overdose , although it does occur , " Mr. Hall says . <p> " In fact , " he adds , " there is a lot we do n't know about regular daily use of LSD . What will be the effect on a person who is 15 , and then when they reach 30 ? Among young groups , there is an attitude that it is not as harmful as cocaine or crack . They say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid . ' " <p> While information is still lacking about the full impact of regular LSD use , the effects of one dose of LSD can last as long as eight hours . When a " bad " trip occurs , the tendency for the user is to think he or she had a " bad " dose . <p> " It 's like being in a wild movie , " says Mr. Woolley . " The kids think they are thinking these great thoughts , getting a new awareness of themselves . They think it sheds new light on their situation . <p> " But it does n't , " he adds , " because once it 's over , it 's back to reality . The more they use it , the more they become alienated from society . " <p> Some drug experts say that LSD 's sporadic availability in communities - linked to the fly-by-night nature of LSD production - causes the drug to be evident in spurts . " It certainly is not used at the levels it was back in the 1970s , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , " LSD : Still With Us After All These Years . " <p> Officials say that because the drug is difficult to make , sophisticated knowledge of chemistry and labs is required . <p> Clandestine laboratories at universities are sometimes the source of the drug , says Ron Woolley , a street worker for The Bridge , a youth organization in Boston . <p> And according to the DEA , makeshift labs in the Northwest , particularly in northern California , also make LSD fairly quickly in concentrated amounts . Then the labs disappear to avoid apprehension . The labs make thousands of doses , usually tiny specks soaked into small pieces of blotter paper . The pieces are sold as " hits , " to be swallowed or chewed . <p> " There are sophisticated marketing schemes used , " Hall says . " An individual can order through the mail from a known contact . It comes in an odorless letter , hundreds of doses on several sheets of paper . " <p> Hall and other experts also cite rock-band tours as sources of LSD distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into town and distribute to their friends , " says Mrs. Henderson . <p> Inner-city teens are not known to be users of LSD . The most use comes from white , middle-class teens in the suburbs . <p> " What concerns me is that it is usually not the first drug a youth has used , or the only drug they will be using . It is an indicator of probable use of other drugs by an individual , " says Henderson . <p> Because attitudes shape behavior , experts say that schools , parents , the media , and law-enforcement agencies need to take a renewed and vigorous stance against illicit drugs . <p> " This is not a runaway epidemic among teens , but it gives rise to caution , " says Lloyd Johnson , a University of Michigan social scientist and the lead researcher on the NIDA study . " Our great progress in the past at lowering rates of illicit drug use among our young people is proof of that . " <p> Between 1979 and 1992 , with a concerted government and community antidrug effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of drugs fell from 54 percent to 27 percent . Since then , use among 12th-graders has edged upward . <p> The penalty for possession of even a few grams of LSD today is a minimum mandatory federal sentence of 10 years .
