In 1948 the principles of the fledgling United Nations were codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . To celebrate the document 's 50th anniversary this past December , the International Quilt Study Center at the University of Nebraska , Lincoln , together with the Robert and Ardis James Foundation and Quilter 's Newsletter Magazine , sponsored " Expressions of Freedom , " a competition which drew quilters from around the world . Their submissions , addressing many of the rights issues contained in the declaration , were judged by Penny McMorris , producer/host of The Great American Quilt series on PBS , Robert Shaw , author of Quilts : A Living Tradition , and Jeannie Spears , senior features editor for Quilter 's Newsletter Magazine . Pictured here are the seven works chosen from 40 finalists to receive awards totaling $24,500 and to join the center 's permanent collection .
