THE NEXT BIG COMET is almost certain to be Comet HaleBopp , C/1995 O1 , which will put on its peak display in late March and early April of next year . Brian Marsden ( IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams ) estimates that Hale-Bopp could reach magnitude - 1.8 around its time of perihelion at the end of March . By comparison , Comet Hyakutake , C/1996 B2 , reached only about magnitude 0.0 or - 0.5 during its Earth flyby last March . Hale-Bopp will be beautifully placed for midnorthern observers , shining in the northwestern sky after evening twilight - just about where Hyakutake was visible last April . Despite their similar peak brightnesses in similar parts of the evening sky at the same time of year , Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake are in many ways opposites . Hale-Bopp is a giant , dust-rich comet with a solid nucleus that 's probably at least 10 and maybe 40 or more kilometers in diameter . Hyakutake , by comparison , was dust-poor and had a 1- to 3km nucleus as determined by radar . Hale-Bopp was discovered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a year and a half before its perihelion . Hyakutake , by contrast , came out of nowhere to fly past Earth just two months after its discovery . Unfortunately Hale-Bopp will be on the opposite side of the solar system from us when at its brightest ; it will never get closer than 1.3 a.u. from Earth . Hyakutake passed by us a mere 0.1 a.u. away . Photograph Visible with binoculars in the evening sky this summer and fall , Comet Hale-Bopp works its way northward through Scutum , Serpens Cauda , and Ophiuchus . For several evenings around October 28th , when it should be about magnitude 4.5 , the comet will be within 1/3deg of the 7.6-magnitude globular cluster M14 and thus in the same telescopic field . Inset : Comet Hale-Bopp on June 12th , imaged by Tim Puckett of Villa Rica , Georgia , using a 12-inch f/7.85 reflector with an ST-6 CCD camera . The frame is 13 ' wide , 1.8 million kilometers at the comet 's distance of 3.2 astronomical units . North is up . // Accordingly , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its head might appear smaller and more concentrated , and its tail could be much brighter . The comet may look whitish yellow if its rate of dust expulsion is high , compared to the bluegreen of Hyakutake 's ionized gas . So far , Hale-Bopp is right on track for a fine performance . Its output of water vapor increased earlier than expected . By April water production equaled the output of carbon monoxide , the gas that originally drove the cometary activity . This milestone had not been expected until summer . Dust production continued strong too . By mid-June Hale-Bopp was an easy sight in binoculars at magnitude 6 1/2 , and observers with very dark skies were glimpsing it with the unaided eye . Telescopic observers were describing a bright stellar condensation on the east end of the coma and a diffuse glow extending west . " The appearance was not of a fan tail , but rather an ellipse of material attached to the condensation , " noted Charles S. Morris using a 20-inch telescope .

Use the chart to pinpoint it for your date just west of the summer Milky Way . The purple constellation lines on the chart are the same as on our nakedeye map in the center of each month 's Sky &; Telescope . According to Marsden the comet should glow at about magnitude 5 1/2 in August , -5 in September , and 4 in November . It will disappear into the sunset in early December , then reappear in the dawn sky in mid-January at 2nd magnitude to begin its 1997 apparition .
