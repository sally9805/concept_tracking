<p> If annyone had looked inside the meeting room , they would have seen a peculiar sight . More than a hundred people had paid to hear a lecture , but the speaker had stepped aside because of circumstances and instead the audience was staring at a kind of Frankenstein monster , a figure with a brown podium for a body and a small television for a head . Suddenly the head had a face , the face of George Bush , telling the nation it had gone to war . <p> We had always expected it to be the television war , and that is what it has been . Tom and Dan and Peter and the pleasant generic news readers of Cable News Network stared into our eyes day after day , night after night . No one could bear to turn them off . <p> But it is not the television war we expected . There has been precious little war to see in these first few days : magnificent planes , the occasional soldier , a few minutes of footage of what looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking heads : this has been a great windfall for retired generals . Once we learned that war had actually begun and Israel had been hit , there was little to discover except that Peter Jennings looks fresh as a daisy on a few hours ' sleep . <p> It was not because of the press of news that we seemed incapable of turning the TV off . The television had become a kind of modern communal meeting place from which to absorb history aborning . It was America 's back fence , the one place in this time of dislocation where we were all connected , all having the same sensation at the same time , even if the sensation was shame at thinking that a correspondent in a gas mask looked like a mutant bug . <p> The television war , they called Vietnam , and it was because it taught us what it really looked like , what happens before the clutch of soldiers hoists the flag to the top of the hill . It made all the ugly stuff real , the brutality and the blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day that General Westmoreland once complained in those days that the television camera saw such a narrow view . But it was wide enough . <p> The television has n't had a view for these last few days ; in truth , television has acted like radio , with still photographs of faces superimposed on maps . But action was not all we were looking for . Sitting in front of the television was the closest we could come to compartmentalizing the sea change . The most enduring memory of my childhood is of a time much like this one , those long November days of watching the Kennedy murder , mourning and burial , in the blackest blacks and the whitest whites I have ever known . Before this , that was the most continuous television I had ever watched . Like this , it did not provide much news . It gave you a feeling of America sitting in a circle . <p> What Americans have seen these last few days is what they had hoped and prayed for : war without tears . The descriptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand video game of the sky . Fighting raged for three days , and the closest we came to seeing casualties was a crumpled van on a Tel Aviv street . <p> Everyone hoped that was because things were going well , whatever that means . Or perhaps it is because no one really knows exactly how things are going . Reporters are far away from the front , reporting from hotel rooms with sealed windows or basements where they crouch for safety 's sake . The Department of Defense is taking pool reporters where it wants them to go , which is nowhere much . <p> So for now , we are eased into the unspeakable , confronting the concept of combat well before we confront its realities , an incremental process that can only benefit those who believe this is a noble endeavor . We see map war , diagram war , computer war . The closest anyone got to something else was CNN , which has given new meaning to the term " intelligence network . " For half a day it had three reporters in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraqis cut off their communications , perhaps because Dick Cheney said at a televised briefing that he was getting information from CNN . A television war , indeed . The Iraqis watch the Secretary of Defense on television reporting that he is monitoring the front by watching television . <p> A new age has begun . Our children will date themselves by the grade they were in when the United States fought Iraq . And as soon as we get accustomed to that , we will need more than retired generals . What we have seen in these first few days is a kind of primitive ritual made modern . When things are very scary , we are afraid to be alone in the dark . There have been people and light in our living rooms . Do n't confuse that with war , or news . Both are yet to come .
