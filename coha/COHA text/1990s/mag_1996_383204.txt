Is Tennessee 's Peyton Manning the best quarterback in the South ? Nope . We think he is the best in the country . and that 's why we chose him as the anchor for our All-South offensive team . The 6-5 , 215pound junior has proven to be an accurate passer  --  just four interceptions in 1995 while passing for 2,954 yards . He also set UT single-season passing records for attempts , completions , completion percentage , and yards gained . Florida 's quarterback Danny Wuerffel had even better stats  --  more touchdowns , more yards , more yards gained per pass . So why did we pick Peyton ?

In 1995 , he rushed for 1,242 yards , averaging 7.5 yards per carry . Rounding out our running game is Tiki Barber from Virginia . He rushed for a school-record 1,397 yards and scored 16 touchdowns last year . During the Cavaliers ' upset of Florida State , Tiki rushed for 193 yards . We built our line around center Ryan Tucker , a 6-6 , 298-pound senior from Texas Christian University . The consensus All-Southwest Conference center graded out at 89% or above for all 11 games .

Senior Curtis McGee , a key player on Georgia Tech 's nationally ranked 1995 offensive unit , has real perseverance . The 6-5 , 285-pound left tackle played the first half of the season with a broken right hand . Standing 6-7 and weighing 280 pounds , tackle Adam Meadows of Georgia has played with some injuries the past two years , but we expect him to emerge as a leader on the Bulldogs ' offensive line .
