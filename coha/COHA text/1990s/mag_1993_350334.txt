Napoleon III had a taste for ostentation . On the ceiling of his gilded reception room in the Louvre is a fresco of the goateed sovereign himself , sitting on his throne and surrounded by puffy clouds and horn-blowing cherubs . . Flying toward him are two figures brandishing architectural plans and a model of the royal palace . The painting commemorates the Emperor 's 1852 decision to expand the edifice by adding a new north wing , named after Cardinal Richelieu , to house his private apartments and expanding bureaucracy . <P> President Francois Mitterrand 's likeness will probably never grace a ceiling . But what he shares with the Emperor is the French monarchical itch to build upon the nation 's patrimony . His Grand Louvre renovation , launched in 1981 , was once attacked as an exercise in Socialist self-aggrandizement . Today the project is described by Jacques Toubon , the new Gaullist Minister of Culture , as " a historic and cultural space without comparison in the world . " <P> About their own culture , all Frenchmen are hyperbolists . But in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the newly rebuilt Richelieu wing last week , he vastly expanded the world 's most famous museum and , for the first time in the palace 's 447-year history , allowed the Louvre to be dedicated entirely to its extraordinary art collections . With its 231,400 sq . ft. of floor space , the three-story Richelieu wing will double the Louvre 's display areas , allowing its curators to pull more than 4,000 works out of the reserves and put a total of 12,000 on view in the new sections alone . <P> Every stage of the Grand Louvre renovation has had its controversy , and this one is no exception . When in 1989 Mitterrand first unveiled architect I.M. Pei 's modernistic glass pyramid in the the museum 's vast central courtyard , the work brought accusations of aesthetic heresy . This time Pei has offended some observers by combining the museum with an underground shopping gallery that includes 13 fast-food counters and 60 boutiques , ranging from Lalique crystal to Esprit sportswear and a Virgin Records Megastore . The new commercial space is elegant and features at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and bathes the beige limestone halls in a rich , silky light . To his critics , Pei responds in the best tradition of the king-picked artist : " The mixing of art , culture and commerce is not impossible , " he says . Besides , the 76-year-old Chinese-American architect points out , the rental income from the shops was necessary to finance an underground garage . <P> The new Richelieu wing is only part of the $1 billion Grand Louvre project , which is likely to last three more years . But last week 's opening , which also - marked the museum 's 200th anniversary , completed Pei 's vision of a subterranean crossroads linking every wing to a central starting point . Before the renovation , the entrances were confusing , and the Richelieu wing , occupied by the Finance Ministry , had been subdivided into a warren of cluttered , low- ceilinged offices . Apart from the Napoleon III apartments , the entire structure had to be gutted and rebuilt by an international team of architects under Pei 's supervision .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
