The recorded history of the genus Capsicum begins with Columbus , who undertook his voyage of discovery in search of ( among other things ) black pepper , the most valuable of Eastern spices . Columbus did not find what he was looking for , but in the opinion of many people , he bit into something much better . He became the first European to blister his tongue on a hot pepper .

The threads of any present moment are spliced into the weave of the past in a complex and often inexplicable way , and just when you think you 've got the pattern figured out , another seems to emerge and the meaning unravels . Or to use a different metaphor , the present and the past swirl together like different colors of paint you 're mixing in a bucket , one color marrying with the other in swirls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something different than either are alone , it 's impossible to say . I know where this story begins , although I do n't yet know how it ends , or what other stories may become woven into it . My life got derailed when Mike McQuaid , on temporary assignment with the Texas Rangers , was gunned down on a lonely road west of San Antonio . Until that rainy February night , I was moving along with confidence into the future , dividing my time between my business ( my herb shop , Thyme and Seasons ) , my family ( McQuaid and his twelve-year-old son , Brian , with whom I live ) , and a few good friends . On that night , the sky fell , and for a long time I wondered whether the darkness would ever end . But one morning , to my surprise , the sun came up , and opened a new chapter . I also know what this story , this chapter of my life , is about . It 's about partners and friends , partnership and alliance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fail in our obligations to one another . But it 's also about trust and teamwork and accepting our mutual interdependence . But enough introduction . As Fannie Couch says , " Ai n't no point messin ' around . Tell the good part first and then the bad , and the rest will follow along on its own . " Fannie is widely venerated as the oracle of Pecan Springs , Texas . I guess I 'd better follow her advice . The good part is that McQuaid is not going to die . The bullet that was lodged against his spine has done the worst of its damage , and unless some unforeseen complications occur during his long recovery , he 'll make it . He 's a strong , tough man who has been beaten , knifed , and shot before , during the years he was a Houston cop . He is a survivor . He 's surviving . The bad part is , well ... " He is going to walk again , " Brian says fiercely . He looks up at me with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand that fate has dealt out to his father . He pushes back the dark hair that has fallen across his forehead and says it again , to convince himself and me . " He is , China . I 'm going to help him . " " Sure , " I say , in as bright a tone as I can manage . Brian appears confident , but I know where his demons are corralled , and it 's not fair to add mine to the herd . I give him a hard quick hug , a rare thing between us , because he is after all a boy and I am not quite his mother . " How about taking a pizza when we go see him tonight ? " " Yeah . " Brian is determinedly , heartbreakingly cheerful . " With anchovies and jalapenos . And chocolate ice cream . No , Double Chocolate Fudge . He has to keep his strength up . " The fierce look is back . " He 's going to walk again , China . I know he is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet at the hospital , Mother McQuaid is red-eyed and tearful and her smile sags under its own weight . Like Brian , she is intent on keeping McQuaid 's strength up , delivering enough cookies , cakes , and hand-knitted argyle bed socks to supply every patient in the hospital . But Dad McQuaid is angrily bluff , in turn raging at the nurses and ranting at the doctors . " Them guys 're s'posed to be so smart , how come Mike ai n't walkin ' yet ? " he demands . " What 'd they learn in medical school ? What 're they doin ' for all that money they get paid ? " Then the anger empties out , and he 's limp and despairing and numb . " He ai n't never gon na walk agin , " he says to me outside the room , wiping his eyes . I murmur disagreement but pat his shoulder , mimicking Brian 's comforting gesture . I feel as if we 've all been flung into deep water , and Brian and I are the only ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true . There 's my mother , who not only knows how to swim but is sure that she is strong enough to tow the raft , with all of us aboard . My relationship with Leatha has been an unhappy one , even after she sobered up a couple of years ago , married Sam , and moved from her luxurious Houston home to his rather primitive ranch near Kerrville . It 's hard to forgive her for not being the mother I wanted so desperately when I was growing up , hard to forget coming home from school and finding her already embarked on her own private happy hour , which invariably ended when I put her to bed , drunk as a skunk , and cooked a frozen dinner for myself . I know , I know -- it 's all in the past and I should bury all those toxic memories and live with what she is now , a recovering alcoholic who desperately wants to be a part of her daughter 's life . But it 's been a stubborn hurt . The only time we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , when we wept with our arms wrapped around each other . Which Leatha took as an invitation . A week after the shooting , I opened the door one afternoon and saw her lugging three suitcases , two cosmetic cases , and a carton of self-help books up the porch steps . In my surprise , I did n't protest hard enough , and the next thing I knew she had installed herself in one of the guest bedrooms of the large Victorian house that McQuaid and I leased last year . Having resprayed her silver bouffant and renewed her mauve lipstick , she came into the office where I was on the phone and the computer at the same time , checking the ad copy that was due at the Pecan Springs Enterprise office that afternoon . Brian was there , regaling me with details of the lunchtime fight he had with his friend Arnold and demonstrating the actual kung-fu punches and kicks they had traded , punctuated with pows and blams . And Howard Cosell , McQuaid 's elderly and ill-tempered bassett hound , was parked under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gravelly voice that the boy was interrupting his nap . Leatha raised her voice above these cacophonies . " You 'll be spending a lot of time with Mike and you ca n't neglect your business , " she announced briskly , " so I 've come to stay for a while . As long as you need me . " I put down the phone . " I do n't need --  " I started to say , but Brian preempted me . " That 's cool , " he said , stopping his martial arts demonstration and getting straight to the heart of the matter . " Can you make waffles for breakfast ? China used to , but she 's too busy right now . " " You 're old enough to make your own waffles , Brian . " I spoke more shortly than I intended , but I was annoyed that he 'd gone over to the enemy so quickly . To my mother , I said , " Brian and I can manage for ourselves , Leatha . Anyway , Sam will get lonely -- and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Leatha once poured into the bottle now goes into worthwhile causes . She has taken on Kerrville 's Friends of the Library , the Courthouse Restoration Project , and the Hospital Auxiliary . To judge from the newspaper clippings she sends , she is a one-woman volunteer army , always anxious to help whoever seems to need it . To be honest , I find this pungently ironic . Where was she when I needed her , forty or so years ago ? " Sam wo n't be lonely long , " Leatha said with equanimity . " His oldest daughter by his first wife left her husband and is moving back home with the baby . And his youngest son has dropped out of college and is living in the bunkhouse . " I do n't try to keep up with the comings and goings of Sam 's family , which seems to ebb and flow like some sort of mysterious tide . " And the projects will just have to take care of themselves for a while . I 'm taking care of you , China . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian . And maybe , some of these weekends , you can go to the ranch with me . That river is full of fish just dying to be caught , and Sam hung a rope swing in the cypress tree , over the swimming hole . He also bought a big brown horse named Rambo . He 's got four white socks and a white blaze on his forehead  --  and he 's the perfect size for a big guy like you . " I gritted my teeth . Flattery , flattery . " Rambo ! " Brian squealed excitedly . " Oh , wow . " He turned to me . " When can I go , China ? When , huh ? " Then he stopped and pulled his dark brows together , looking serious . " But maybe I better not . I better stay and cheer Dad up . He gets kinda down sometimes . " I made another effort . " Leatha , " I said , " Brian and I really do n't need --  " " Yes , you do , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . " Brian looked from one to the other of us , figuring the angles . The ranch might not be in the cards , but there were always waffles . " Blueberry is my favorite , " he said . " Mine too , " she said with a bright smile that showed all her teeth . " I absolutely adore making blueberry waffles . Meanwhile , maybe you can tell me where the laundry soap lives . There 's a pile of very muddy jeans in the bathroom . " She wrinkled her nose . " With a monstrous creature on top . It is green . " I was bemused by the thought of my elegant mother ( who for years had a maid to rinse out her stockings ) actually washing Brian 's grubby jeans and making blueberry waffles for him . But Brian ( who is supposed to put his own jeans in the washer ) was enthusiastic . " I 'll show you the soap , " he offered helpfully . " The monster is Einstein . He 's an iguana , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless he 's sitting in the sun . " Leatha looked startled . " In the sun ? " " Yeah . Sunshine makes him frisky . It triggers his aggressive genes . " He prodded Howard Cosell with his toe . " Hey , Howard , you dumb old dog . Wake up . We 're going to do the laundry . " Howard Cosell raised his head and bared snaggly yellow teeth , promising that he would bite , if certain people did n't go away and let him finish his nap . Leatha had recovered her poise . " Well , come along , then , " she commanded , rattling her silver bangle bracelets . " And while I 'm here , it might be better to keep Einstein in the dark . " She narrowed her eyes . " What about those other creatures of yours , Brian ? That ... tarantula ? " " Ivan the Hairible ? Oh , I still have him , " he said eagerly . " Would you like to see ? " Leatha shuddered . " I think not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , briskly , " Really , China , do n't you think you ought to get your hair cut ? I 'm sure Mike would appreciate a less straggly you when he 's able to be up and around . " Howard Cosell gave a resigned sigh and covered his eyes with his paws . I suppressed a snarl and went back to the computer . I did n't need a crystal ball to know that this arrangement was not going to work . Through the long , anxious weeks that followed , I was n't sure which hurt most : being with McQuaid or not being with him . Like most people , I hate hospitals -- the chill white sterility of the hallways and rooms , the antiseptic smell , the curt , crisp efficiency of the nurses . I wonder if they 're taught not to care in nursing school or whether those frozen faces come with the uniform -- or whether they really do care and have to pretend they do n't or fall apart . But the hospital was only a backdrop to the real pain . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's powerful presence , a former football quarterback and ex-cop who 'd kept his strong muscles and his flat belly and -- most notably -- his cheerful attitude . He could be commanding and authoritative , especially when he was lecturing in one of his classes at Central Texas State University , where he 's on the Criminal Justice faculty . But most of the time , he was confident and optimistic , your basic nice guy . McQuaid was still big and still strong -- it would take more than a couple of weeks on his back to change that -- but the attitude was gone . Trussed up with plastic tubes , wired to machines , and able to move only his hands ( even that little bit was an enormous improvement over the first few days , when he could n't move at all ) , he would close his eyes and go inside himself , away from me , silent , remote , utterly despairing . I understood what took him away , but my understanding did n't ease his pain or calm his fear or bring him back from the dark place he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . For five years , McQuaid had wanted us to get married . Out of pride in my independence and self-sufficiency , I had always refused -- until just before the shooting , when I woke up to the way I really felt about him and was ready to agree . But by that time , he 'd gotten involved with somebody else . With Margaret Graham , a woman fifteen years younger than me , his partner in an investigation into corruption high up in the Texas Rangers ' chain of command . But although their brief affair was over and Margaret and I had become friends , the shooting changed McQuaid 's view of the future -- and his desire to get married . " Let 's let it ride for a while " was all he 'd say when I brought it up . He did n't have to tell me why . I knew that he feared he 'd never be whole and healthy again , and he did n't want to burden me with his care , with half a husband . But as I sat beside his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Enterprise or reporting on my recent consultation with Brian 's math teacher or just watching Mike sleep , I would think of the numbing moment when I feared I had lost him , and feel grateful . Whole or half , healthy or disabled , it did n't matter . McQuaid was here , he was alive , and that was enough . Beneath the gratitude , though , I was heavy with sadness and loss . Why had I been so afraid of intimacy , of caring , of marriage ? Why had I built such a wall against his love ? If only I had been able to give more , we might have shared more . If only I had n't been afraid to be vulnerable , we might have been more open with each other . If only ... if only ... At those moments , I had to turn away to keep him from seeing the tears . I did n't want him to think I was weeping for him -- for what he had been and might not ever be again . I was weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
