Before Tupac Shakur died last Friday , as he lay in a Las Vegas hospital with a lung removed , an intestinal wound and two fingers missing , a security video turned up . It was shot not long before he was ; it showed the casino area of the MGM Grand Hotel , where Shakur had stayed while in town for the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon heavyweight fight . According to hotel employees , the tape recorded the superstar rapper and his entourage brutally " beating and stomping " an unidentified man . The Las Vegas police have seen the tape , but they claim that its contents are unrelated to the hail of bullets that cut Shakur down two hours later . It says much about the 25-year-old rapper 's chosen life-style that police could exclude so obvious a motive for murder and still have several to spare . <P> The death of Shakur , who sold more than 10 million albums , constitutes a defining nightmare for a gangsta-rap world whose paranoid royalty seem increasingly compelled to live out the grotesque violence that fills its art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal participation in an ugly feud between his California record label , Death Row , and its East Coast competitor , Bad Boy . It was Death Row president Marion ( " Suge " ) Knight who was driving his black BMW after the Tyson fight , with Shakur standing up through the sun roof . Four men rolled up in a white Cadillac , fired about 13 rounds , and sped away , losing the police in traffic . Knight told authorities his head was turned the other way at the key moment and he saw nothing . Said police spokesman Phil Roland : " We 're puzzled that his whole entourage had their heads turned and did n't see anything . " <P> Shakur was born in New York City into a nobility of violence : his mother , a Black Panther , was jailed on a bombing charge while she was pregnant with him , although she was later acquitted . His father was shot and killed when Tupac was a child . Their son , meanwhile , wrote sensitive poetry while attending the High School of Performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extolling black womanhood or elders . Increasingly , however , such lyrics were shouldered aside by the bitches and cop-killing bullets of gangstaism . The dominant persona , says rap reporter Larry Hester , was " a villain , a joker . " <P> Then the artist regressed into his character . Shakur carried a gun and shot at people . He escaped conviction on a series of assault charges , but a 1993 sexual-abuse complaint stuck . He arrived for sentencing in a wheelchair ; days earlier , he had been shot five times in a Manhattan " robbery " he regarded as a failed hit . Out on appeal last October , he sought protection under the wing of the massive , much feared Knight , who was deeply embroiled in his feud with Bad Boy and the East . In two years the conflict had moved far beyond artistic issues to beatings and perhaps worse : Knight is thought to hold Bad Boy head Sean ( " Puffy " ) Combs indirectly responsible for the shooting death of a friend in Atlanta in 1995 . One of Shakur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to kill him in 1994 and that he had slept with the wife of one of the label 's star rappers , the Notorious B.I.G .
