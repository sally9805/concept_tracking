<p> Christmas came the long way to the Persian Gulf , filling the desert with songs , prayers for peace and flickering candles in thankful hands . <p> The 25-foot-tall fir tree on the top deck of this hospital ship came from Manila on a garbage-collection barge . " It was the only way we could get it aboard in time for Christmas , " says E-5 Tammy S. Begasse , 29 , of San Jose , Calif . <p> Box after box of cookies and candy - addressed to " Any Service Member " - were spread across the desert on mess hall tables , in tents , ready rooms and guard shacks . <p> The gifts arrived from every corner of the USA , delivered by a military postal system struggling under a daily mountain of 300 tons of mail and munchies for Operation Desert Shield . <p> " I 'll never forget this Christmas , " says Capt . Richard Mattie , 58 , of Hornell , N.Y. , the Mercy 's Roman Catholic chaplain . " God works in strange ways . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels swept up in a crisis he never saw coming . <p> The feeling of Christmas - for sailors , soldiers , Marines and aviators on duty , on guard and on alert this holy season - had to come from the heart , because home is so far away and war seems ever closer . <p> For the Mercy 's youngest , lowest-ranking sailor , Aviation Recruit Stephanie Harr , 19 , being at sea on the brink of an historic confrontation " is kind of scary . " A few months ago , she was in high school in San Antonio . " My family 's scared , and I 'm scared , " she says while refereeing a flag football game on the windy helicopter flight deck . " But they 're proud of me . " <p> She felt " honored " to cut the cake on the Navy 's birthday . And she had a big role in the Christmas Eve party , as a " reindeer " for Santa 's cargo- trolley sleigh . She cut everyone 's antlers out of stiff cardboard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home than for us , " says the Mercy 's Protestant chaplain , Capt . Doug Weadick , 40 , of Orlando , Fla . His wife and two sons - Matt , 15 , and Joe , 12 - live in Novato , Calif . " We have a big job to do and we know we 're OK . But back there , they worry about us . " <p> But even with all the services , Masses , carol-sings , food and fuzzy red Santa caps , it did n't seem much like Christmas for some . " It would take being home for that , " said Lt. Cmdr. Susan Griffin , 38 , of Martinez , Calif . But she added : " The Mercy is my home for now , and this is my family . " <p> As usual in a trying time , religions mingled and made room for all those who wanted to share and seek solace . <p> Mattie and Weadick held a joint service on Christmas Eve . A few days earlier , Lt. Cmdr. Robert Olshaker , 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mercy 's four other Jewish sailors , and some non-Jewish visitors joined Olshaker , a radiologist . " We did n't have a rabbi , " he says . " But you make do the best you can . I have to admit I never thought I 'd be celebrating Jewish holidays in this part of the world . " <p> His part of the world , for now , is just off the coast of the Arabian peninsula , where 300,000 U.S. troops go through daily training and stock up on ammunition and fuel for a possible all-out battle with the Iraqi occupiers of Kuwait . <p> Christmas on the peninsula was also a make-do affair , at times bleak and lonely , other times full of fun and work . <p> Troops of the 37th Engineer Battalion , 20th Engineer Brigade , watched videos from their families back home on a VCR , then put on the Jimmy Stewart Christmas classic , It 's a Wonderful Life . As a cold desert wind whistled through the darkness , troops trudged to the top of a sandy butte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , they held the candles beneath their cotton hats to keep the wicks aflame . After the final carol , says 1st Lt. Alfonso Rivera , 25 , of Lorain , Ohio , " nobody wanted to leave . Just the thought of the Christmas spirit being around made everybody happy . We took the Christmas spirit and took it up on the mountain . " <p> Some of the troops spending Christmas in Saudi Arabia wanted to keep celebrations to a minimum , to avoid the loneliness and empty feelings that come with knowing you 're not where you want to be on an important day . <p> Spec . Doris Coyle , 29 , of Holmen , Wis. , and Sgt. Sheri Olson , 27 , of Black River Falls , Wis. , were called up as part of their National Guard maintenance company . " We 've been here six weeks , " Coyle says , " and it seems like six months . " <p> So instead of tossing presents , they organized a flag football game . " Let 's just pretend it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier not to think about it . " <p> But she ca n't help but think about her son , Jacob , born in June , weeks before she was sent here . She thinks she should be home with him , " but I signed up for the National Guard , and they sent me here . " <p> Spec . Eddie Baker , 23 , of Tifton , Ga. , spent part of his Christmas on the back of a trailer-truck , one of several decorated as " floats " for a parade around the camp of the 724th Support Missile Battalion of the 24th Infantry Division . <p> " The theme is peace on Earth , " says Baker , who was the GI shaking hands with a make-believe Iraqi soldier . <p> Chief Warrant Officer Bill Trainer , 38 , of Mount Gilead , Ohio , preferred to concentrate on the daily missile-maintenance and parts-replacement duties of his unit . " The best way to get through these holidays , " he says , " is to stay busy doing what you have to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , Trainer says , " I think you can feel the tension building . " He thinks Saddam Hussein wo n't " come out of Kuwait voluntarily . " <p> As Christmas faded into history , the U.N . date and an uncertain future drew nearer on the horizon . Aboard the Mercy , hugs and cheery greetings were replaced by the grim reality of training for its mission : to mend the wounds of war , when and if it comes . <p> On Christmas Eve , while throbbing engines muffled the sound of caroling voices , a broad band of light from an ivory half-moon streamed across the black water toward the snow-white ship . On the same steel deck Christmas morning , Stephanie Harr fulfilled a promise she 'd made to someone back in San Antonio . <p> She faced west - toward the desert , the silent sky and all the Christmas days of her past - and shouted a message into the wind .
