<p> No mandates for savings <p> A $ 100 billion plum is ready for picking . The problem is , unfortunately , that people will be people and the government seems to have never met a tax it did n't like . <p> Whatever is done with retirement-planning options , if there are no mandates for saving , there will be large numbers of people with little or no assets and no income on reaching retirement . <p> We know they will receive assistance from the government , but there wo n't be the huge inflow of funds from Social Security taxes to offset these costs . People will still be people . <p> Designated retirement plans should be allowed to pass tax-free to surviving spouses and to children of the retiree as long as the plan is held only as retirement income for the spouse , and upon the surviving spouse 's death , as retirement income for the children when they reach retirement age . <p> As with current inheritance laws , there should be upper limits on the size of retirement plan funds so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole hen house . <p> But we must remember : The government has never met a tax it did n't like . <p> John Payne , La Porte <p> Government regs a lot like taxes <p> Coming from a member of Congress , the remarks of Sen. Rod Grams , R-Minn. , seem disingenuous at best : The present tax system is a creature of the Congress in which Grams serves ( Outlook , May 8 , " Taking far too long for Tax Freedom Day to arrive " ) . <p> Grams ' call for a replacement which is " flatter , simpler , fairer " likewise misses the mark , proving ( as if more proof were needed . . . ) that our Congress is completely divorced from rationality . <p> Take education as an example . Since 1950 , average class size has declined from 30 to 22 , yet the conventional wisdom is that the situation has gone from bad to worse . <p> At the same time , Congress ' concern for education has gone from near-zero to a budget written with 12 digits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled to increase in order to reduce class size even further . <p> Just as no one is asking what might be the limit for class size , no one is asking why Congress is involved with education nor , it seems , whether or not they are doing any good . <p> Even with all of that , Grams misses an important point : All government regulation operates much like taxation . Add in the costs of regulatory departments and agencies , such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , Environmental Protection Agency , Federal Communication Commission , Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( I 'm sure I missed dozens ) , then Tax Freedom Day moves into July . <p> And Grams ca n't avoid responsibility for any of it . <p> Frank Clarke , Houston <p> Homogeneous subdivision <p> I have seen the deterioration brought on by modern deed restrictions . The concept of a neighborhood - where neighbors band together to help one another - has changed to one where people spy on each other and then rat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening . <p> While the signs at the gates of the subdivision may say " deed restrictions enforced , " a more truthful version would be , " We do n't love our neighbors - we sue them . " <p> I would rather live where I am unable to control what my neighbor does with his own property than live in a neighborhood where anyone who is " outside of the box " is run out of town on a rail . <p> Will Blumentritt , Houston <p> Clinton-bashers are tiring <p> Donald Kaul 's Editorial page column May 2 , " Right wing right about bilingual education , " was exactly correct . I know Kaul is a liberal because he said so in a column last year . <p> I tire of Clinton-bashers , who have no purpose other than the defeat of an opponent . After Bill Clinton , they 'll move on to someone else , some other personality . If there was some principled consistency , I would n't mind as much , but there is n't any . <p> I very much appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic spectra on so many different subjects . It is a species of publishing integrity we need to see more of . <p> Graydon Wilson , Houston <p> Welfare as an investment <p> Susan Gates ( Viewpoints , May 8 , " Corporate ' welfare ' is sickening " ) pointed out one of the main differences between Republicans and Democrats : Tax breaks for corporations , which she sees as corporate welfare , are seen by many Republicans as an investment in jobs and people . <p> First the corporation invests the money , makes a profit and pays taxes on the profit . Each dollar of taxes the corporation pays is $ 1 that we individuals do not have to pay . Second , the corporation invests the money , creates jobs , hires the people who would otherwise be on welfare and pays them a salary that keeps them off welfare . <p> Democrats such as Gates would prefer to pay the welfare money directly to the welfare people and not force them to work for it . Choose the method ( party ) that you prefer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba <p> Jack Sheehan 's May 10 Outlook article , " Bring down the barriers , " should be sent to every senator and congressman . While we will never know , I believe it was our blind support of the corrupt dictator , Fulgencia Batista 's regime and failure to support Fidel Castro after he was able to overthrow Batista , that drove Castro into the arms of the Russians . <p> Congress should be ashamed of allowing bigots like Sen. Jesse Helms , R-N.C. , and the ultra right of the Republican Party to continue our insane , petty Cold-War attitude toward Cuba . It is a disgrace to our nation , which most of the world looks to for leadership in the protection of human rights . <p> Dick Baurmann , Atascocita <p> Subs deserve double pay <p> Cindy Horswell 's May 10 article ( " Sometimes there is no substitute ; Schools are lowering standards to staff classrooms for absent teachers " ) about substitute teachers in public schools , left out a couple of facts that may explain why substitute teachers are so hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School District teacher and later substitute teacher , I can tell you two reasons why . First , the pay is low . The last time my wife substituted , the benefits were less than half of what a regular teacher got for a day 's work . <p> Second , unless you substitute on a regular basis , you experience the sudden shock of how terribly today 's public school students behave , as compared to how they behaved just a few years earlier . It is enough to make a substitute want double the regular teacher 's pay to do the job . <p> John Herbster , Houston <p> Not all Houstonians drive <p> A May 8 Chronicle article notes a 13.8 percent increase this year in passenger trips on regular Metro bus routes ( " Metro has ' ride ' stuff to break record " ) . At the same time , some vested interests want to transfer ever more of Metro 's funds for a toll road along the Westpark corridor . I say , let the private sector build and operate it , so the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After a decade of siphoning off funds from transit operations , it 's time to start plowing money back into improved bus service . As ridership increases , not only frequency , but also reliability of service needs to be improved . Buses need to be better maintained . With our new mayor , Houston should concentrate on building a transportation system that will serve all Houstonians - not just those who have cars . <p> Leland A. Dolan , Houston
