Never mind that her mother is romance-novel auteur Dame Barbara Cartland , or that she is stepmother to Princess Diana ; Raine , Countess Spencer , is not a woman to be upstaged  --  or underestimated . Just 15 months after burying Earl Spencer , her husband of 16 years  --  and , not incidentally , being hustled out of his ancestral home by his children  --  the grande dame was flashing an enormous sapphire engagement ring presented to her by Jean Francois de Chambrun . On July 10 , when she walks down the aisle at Cold Ashton parish church near Bath , tout London will be deconstructing the alliance . The question on everyone 's lips : How did a matron with a surreal bouffant , steamroller personality and the reputation of a wicked stepmother snare an aristocratic bon vivant ? In fact , gossips have been working overtime since May 9 , when the Countess , 63 , announced her engagement to Chambrun , 56 . It seems that not only did Raine 's suitor , a divorced Frenchman who owns a water filtration company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that he has a reputation for being an impulsive romantic . Put that together with his alleged financial troubles , add the fact that the ambitious Raine reportedly is worth at least $8 million , toss in a bit of controversy about the groom 's renting his threadbare castle near Cannes to a porn-film crew , add some dramatic tension in the form of Di and her sibs ' icy relationship with Raine , and you have a juicy tale indeed . Both Spencer and Chambrun claim that they were n't in the mood for love when they met at an April dinner party given by a mutual friend in Monte Carlo . Although seldom without a man since the age of 19 , when she wed the Earl of Dartmouth ( from whom she was divorced in 1976 ) , Raine insists that she was " resolutely not looking for romance . " Chambrun , divorced in 1989 from American heiress Josalee Douglas ( mother of their daughters Elizabeth , 23 , and Ariane , 20 ) , has said that he " was enjoying his freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the two " talked all the other guests under the table , " as Chambrun has put it . Smitten , he flew to England soon afterward , inspected Raine 's $2.5 million house in Mayfair and swept her off for a week at the Ritz in Paris . When he proposed on May 1 , " I accepted immediately for fear he would change his mind , " she admitted . As the wedding plans were firmed up , however , skeletons began tumbling from his closets : On May 13 , Princess Angela von Hohenzollern , 52 , told the London Daily Express that in 1991 , Chambrun had asked her to marry him on their third date . One month later , French divorcee Nicole Bruggemann , 48 , told the press that Chambrun was vowing he still loved her ; he had proposed to Raine , she hinted , only to solve his financial problems . ( Claiming that their affair ended in October , Chambrun dismissed her as a woman scorned . ) Scenting blood , London tabloids reported that his castle was acquired during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count , he is a second son who has no title . Businessman Jacques Audier came forward in mid-June and claimed that Chambrun and his brother had neglected to pay him in full when they bought his swimming-pool company in 1978 , and asked him for the $540,000 balance . On June 18 , a bailiff entered Chambrun 's $5 million chateau , drew up a list of contents and gave him 30 days to pay or see the lot go for auction . ( On June 28 , Chambrun reportedly paid Audier $180,000 and promised another check by July 8 . ) It was the filming of Erotic Dreams II , however , that proved the biggest embarrassment : Late in May , Chateau Garibondy ( which is rented for part of the year to visitors ) was let to producers of a porn movie . In a spoof of a Hello ! magazine story featuring Raine and Chambrun , erotic scenes were staged in the spots where the couple had been photographed . For his part , Chambrun declared himself " not at all upset " about the publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEOPLE underwrite the redecoration of his dining room , he said that the inquiries into his affairs were " totally inappropriate " and added , " Times are very difficult . It costs $150,000 a year to run this place . " Raine 's family seems to have supported her choice : Prince Charles lunched with the two in May , and Diana ( who has recently reached a detente with her ) sent flowers . Only Cartland has admitted to having doubts . " I am very anxious about her , " she has said . " Experience proves that if you try to dissuade people ... from marrying someone , it only tends to harden their resolve .... I pray she 'll be happy . " Even in her rush to the altar , Raine has overlooked no detail : In an interview in Paris , she described her Ungaro wedding gown and the white silk dress she plans to wear at the London civil marriage ceremony on July 8 . She also told a reporter that she expects to move into the peeling chateau , which she plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never live in an old house again , " she said . " I had had quite enough of leaky roofs and massive maintenance bills . Yet here I am doing it all over again . It must be love ! " <p>
