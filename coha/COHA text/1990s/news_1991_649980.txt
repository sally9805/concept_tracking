##@x <p> After four days of exhaustion , confusion and frustration , the Senate finally must decide . Did Clarence Thomas overcome Anita Hill 's charges of sexual misconduct ? Those who think so , and find him otherwise qualified , can feel justified in voting tonight to confirm him for the Supreme Court . But those who believe Anita Hill will feel a compelling duty to vote no . And so can those senators who came out of these ragged hearings unsure who was telling the truth . <p> Believe him or not , nothing in this bizarre episode enhances Judge Thomas 's qualifications , which were slim to start . Believe him or not , his behavior on the witness stand does nothing to enhance those qualifications . Believe him or not , to confirm him is to gamble . <p> If Judge Thomas were a brilliant jurist , a Holmes or a Brandeis , the gamble might be justified . But Clarence Thomas offers no such brilliance , no basis for gambling with the public 's confidence in , and the future of , American law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national passions and tensions , will occupy analysts for years . Even now it bears being thought about in three parts : the snarling process for approving Presidential nominees ; the sexual harassment charges , and the decision whether to confirm him . The Nominating Process <p> " Who are they to judge ? " Republicans sputtered last week as they contemplated the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee . They saw the shadow of three K 's  --  the " Keating Five " S. &; L. scandal affecting Dennis DeConcini ; the Neil Kinnock plagiarism episode that embarrassed the chairman , Joseph Biden , in the 1988 campaign ; and the 1969 death of Mary Jo Kopechne in a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy . <p> Democrats quickly found plenty of reason for bitter complaint against Republican behavior . Lawyers winced when Arlen Specter , a former prosecutor who knows better , sternly pronounced Anita Hill guilty of perjury for sparring with him over a side issue . Shabbier still were Alan Simpson 's innuendoes  --  not even open charges  --  about " stuff , " as he darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill . <p> Whether one came out of this bizarre week favoring Professor Hill or Judge Thomas , the sure loser was the committee . Charged by the Senate with fast fact-finding , it fell into endless , dreary hours of repeating the obvious . There was reason to explore details of the relationship between the two principals  --  yet the fact-finding ended with big facts unfound . <p> It is unfair , nevertheless , to blame only the Senate . The underlying explanation lies in divided government . When a Republican President sends nominees to a Democratic Senate , there 's inevitable potential for conflict . The President , too , is responsible for the surly mess . He starts the process ; he can offer choices likely to win bipartisan support , or he can try to fight and incite . <p> To repair the process will take good will on both sides  --  and that had better come soon . The position of Attorney General has already been vacant for two months . Both the President and the Senate must wish fervently for a hearing process that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last four days . The Harassment Case <p> When Professor Hill 's sex harassment charges began to circulate , Thomas supporters were happy to ignore them ; opponents were so fearful of seeming to obstruct a black nominee that not one of the committee 's 14 white males sought even a brief delay to investigate . It took a last-minute leak to force the new hearings . <p> Professor Hill responded with credible dignity to the usual obstacles to women who claim victimization in the workplace  --  male disbelief , insensitivity and defensiveness . She gave quiet , plausible testimony about unwanted but repeated advances and vulgar sexual talk by Mr. Thomas , who had been her boss at two agencies . Persuasive witnesses corroborated her distress . <p> Judge Thomas , in evident pain , responded with flat denials and an overheated cry of " lynching " that invoked centuries of murderous racial injustice . In one telling moment , he strained both credulity and judicial temperament . How did he respond to Anita Hill 's various accusations ? He could n't say ; he had refused to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original hearings when he insisted he was unprepared to discuss an article on natural law . It was in those hearings that he badly bruised his credibility by insisting he had never discussed the merits of Roe v. Wade , the abortion landmark , with anyone , ever . <p> The Confirmation Vote <p> Even Judge Thomas agreed that a candidate guilty of the claimed harassment ought not to be confirmed . That simplifies the decision for those who believe her , but it does n't answer the problem of those who find the harassment decision too close to call . <p> Senators in that position , mostly moderate Democrats , are left to evaluate two possibilities . If Clarence Thomas is telling the truth , to reject him because of these accusations would constitute a grave injustice to a decent man and public servant . But if he is not telling the truth , to confirm him would risk casting a shadow on the Supreme Court for years . <p> A vote to confirm , in other words , is a gamble . A judicial giant might survive serious doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant . @@649980 1 <p> I enter the lobby of Claire Nightingale 's apartment building , here to tell her I have murdered her only son . As always , the marble foyer is hushed and dim , almost sepulchral , and , as always , two doormen stand watch over the evening shift . The one who opens the door for me is named Victor . He recognizes my face  --  of course he does , he 's worked here for years  --  and he says , " They starving you at that college ? I can see your ribs , buddy . " <p> " Hunger strike , " I say , trying on a smile , but my voice comes out too loudly and echoes clumsily around the hollow space . My mouth still feels new , these lips , this meaty tongue . I cough to cover my mistake and walk toward the elevator at the back of the lobby . The second doorman looks up from his copy of the Post . Our eyes meet briefly , and he looks down again , uninterested . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me . " She 'll be happy to see you . She 's always talking about you . " <p> I want to tell him that I already know she 's upstairs , that I saw her step out of her taxi fifteen minutes ago from my hiding spot across Central Park West . Instead I just give him a wave and press the elevator button . I sat on a park bench for hours , waiting for Claire to return from wherever she was  --  holed up in her Chelsea office , suffering through some hopeless date , alone at the movies  --  all the while holding myself tightly against the November cold . When a cab finally pulled up to the building and I saw Claire get out , her slight , familiar outline backlit by the lobby 's glow , I suppressed the urge to run across the street and grab her right there on the sidewalk . I had to remind myself about the doormen and the neighbors and the dog walkers , about strangers heading for the subway entrance on the corner or tourists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural History . This was a private matter ; there was no need for anyone else to get involved . <p> From my bench I watched her hand Victor a leather bag , laugh along with something he said , touch his shoulder . Even at her lowest , she can always pull herself together for these brief encounters , these rote , mannerly interactions . There is always decorum . There is always propriety . I lived alongside Claire and her son , Luke , for fourteen years , and I know that trusting any particular Claire to hang around for too long is always a mistake . Luke never liked to admit this , to himself or anyone else , so I used to say it to his face : You 're not dumb , just incurably nanve . As I sat on the bench , Victor opened the door for Claire and pulled it shut after her . Behind my back , Central Park shivered along with me , bare branches and spindly bushes rasping in the wind . I stood up and stamped feeling back into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . <p> But do n't mistake this for a complaint . I can now pick a coffee cup off the counter and carry it over to the table on the other side of the room . I can shake a man 's hand . I can drive a car . I can press my palm onto a square of wet cement and leave a mark . I have a voice that can be heard by anyone who cares to listen . I am here , in the world , in the flesh , a body moving in space . And , of course , Claire can no longer ignore me . She never liked how much time Luke spent alone with me ; even when we were children she suspected that our friendship was the face of something dark and hidden . But tonight she will be forced to listen to what I have to say . It 's something for which I 've waited a long time  --  fourteen years  --  and part of me wants to jab at the elevator button like a maniac , to sprint up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yell and scream and bang my head against the marble lobby walls . <p> But I do n't . I stand with my hands clasped behind my back , my body rigid and still , my frenzy contained . Above my head , floor numbers light up in reverse . In the brass doors , my reflection is murky and distorted , as though submerged in a pool of dirty water . Outside on the street , someone shouts , a car door slams . The second doorman shakes his newspaper . I wait and watch the numbers tumble downward . <p> The day I met Luke , I was alone in the playground when I heard someone call my name . I turned around and his face was there in front of mine . He was six years old then . His skin was pale , his features delicate and precise , just like his mother 's . His left eye was yellow-flecked green , the right brown , as if , instead of melding , his parents ' genes had been split evenly , an eye for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came looking for me first . I did n't ask for any of it . <p> " Hi , " he said . " I 'm Luke . Want to play a game ? " <p> He explained the rules : " The dinosaurs try to eat us , but we hide and use these "  --  he waved a neon-orange water gun  --  " to shoot them instead . Get it , Daniel ? " <p> I nodded slowly . Daniel ? It was true , that was my name . This was how things were at first : Luke said it and that made it so . He looked at me , not quite satisfied . " You need a laser pistol too . Here . " I felt something cold and heavy weigh down my hand . I looked at my gun . It was dull silver metal , double-barreled and snub-nosed , a scope mounted atop the barrels . " You aim through that , " Luke said , pointing at the scope . <p> We were in the playground across from the Metropolitan Museum . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in a sandpit in the shadow of a toy brick pyramid , fifteen feet tall at its peak and dotted with footholds to help children scale its sloped sides . I watched as two older boys fought their way to the top , clawing at the gritty bricks and each other until one slipped , ripping a hole in the knee of his khakis and sliding down to the base . Luke winced , and the boy cried , clutching his knee while his rival peered down at him from the top of the pyramid . I could n't help laughing at the boy 's scrunched-up face , such an obvious exaggeration . The theatrics of a loser . <p> " Stop laughing , " Luke told me . " It 's not funny . " He waved me toward two tire swings , where a little girl spun in lazy circles , humming to herself . She pinned us with a pair of watery eyes and said , " I was leaving anyway , " before she hopped off and disappeared behind a family of concrete turtles . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires . We lay there on our stomachs , a pair of snipers propping up our guns in the desert sand . I looked around while we waited . Plump babysitters pushed strollers and held the hands of toddlers in bulky parkas . Girls in pale blue skirts shared cigarettes and eyed the boys jostling one another out by the bus stop in their maroon blazers . I did n't see any dinosaurs . <p> " There ! " Luke whispered , pointing toward the museum . " A Tyrannosaurus rex . Be very quiet and do n't shoot until I say . " <p> I followed his finger . At first I saw nothing except the glare of the sun on the glass wall of the museum , but gradually a two-story outline took shape and filled in on the lawn in front of the wall . Two giant legs rippled with sinewy muscle and ended in tri-clawed feet . Tiny , almost dainty arms hung tight against a massive torso . A triangular head opened its mouth to display rows of fist-sized teeth . Old white scars marred brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a thigh like war paint . <p> " See him ? " <p> I nodded . The tyrannosaurus lurched toward the playground and the earth shuddered under our stomachs . Its shadow dwarfed the trees , and I could see the reflection of its spiny back receding on the glass wall as it stalked across the road between the museum and the playground , hunched forward , its black eyes sweeping the space at its feet . A wailing police car sped between its legs as it stepped over the playground 's fence . I checked my vision through the scope , finding the creature in the crosshairs . <p> " Go ! " Luke shouted , and we rolled out from under the swings , scrambled to our feet , and ran toward a chain-metal bridge . The tyrannosaurus spotted us from the edge of the playground and began moving faster , dipping its head low , showing us its teeth . Wrist-thick ropes of saliva webbed the space between its two rows of incisors , and a chunk of flesh dislodged itself and tumbled wetly to the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , strident , insistent , scaling upward like a warped record : " Luuuke ! " <p> Her name fit . Claire Nightingale was small-boned and birdlike , full of sharp , quick movements . She stood at the far end of the playground , the setting sun flush in her face , her body bisected by shadow . She fluttered her hands at us . " Time to go . " Luke did n't move , and I glanced over my shoulder : the tyrannosaurus was nowhere to be found . Claire 's hands were now on her hips . " Luke ! " She wore a navy pantsuit and black flats , and was coatless despite the bite of the early-winter afternoon . She stamped her foot , pointed at the ground in front of her . " Come here this instant . " <p> Luke sighed , looked at me , shrugged . My gun disappeared as he walked toward his mother . Halfway there he stopped and turned back to me . " Come on . You do n't want to stay here by yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was within reach , Claire kissed his cheek and grabbed his wrist , hard . " I lost track of time . We 're late . " <p> " Daniel 's going to come with us , " Luke said . " He 's my new friend . " <p> I nodded at Claire , but she did n't give me more than a glance . " Is that so ? " <p> " I wo n't make any trouble , " I said . <p> Claire smiled , a private thing . " I suppose that 's fine . " <p> Luke stuffed the water gun in his pocket and took my hand , making himself a bridge between his mother and me as we walked onto Fifth Avenue . A second police car and then an ambulance screamed past us , parting the downtown traffic with their urgent authority . I followed their course over my shoulder and saw them pull to a halt a few blocks south , where a small crowd had gathered on the sidewalk across from the museum , but then Luke dragged me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you not to roll around in that filthy sand . " Claire glanced down at the grit streaking her son 's sweatshirt . " You could get a disease . " <p> " How ? " <p> " Anything that lives in the sand , if it gets inside you it will live there too . I 'm trying to keep you safe , Luke . " He nodded , but I could tell he did n't understand . " I mean living things you ca n't see . They 're everywhere . They 're all over you and you ca n't even feel them . And us , people , we 're vulnerable to even the smallest . Our skin is permeable . Do you know what that means ? " " Porous , " I said , but she continued as though she had n't heard me . " It means we 're dotted with holes . Cheesecloth . Sieves . And then these things get inside us and mingle with what 's ours until we ca n't tell the difference between the two . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort through her speech , but I did n't know what was important and what could be thrown away . <p> The Nightingale apartment was on 106th Street , across Fifth Avenue from the Conservatory Garden , which was almost never crowded , not even in the spring when flamboyant tulips and roses splattered its lawns . In winter , the garden was reduced to an arrangement of sharp-cornered hedges , an homage to discipline and order . Benches nestled hidden in dense folds of brambles ; sheltered corners offered up a wealth of shadows . Even that first time , I felt a strong , simple appreciation for the garden as the three of us passed by its gates and crossed the street to their apartment building . <p> The elevator deposited us on the penthouse floor , where the doors opened directly into the apartment 's plush but cramped space . Over Luke 's shoulder , in the living room , a massive wooden armoire abutted a mirrored liquor cabinet , which in turn crowded a low glass table cluttered with bamboo baskets . In the foyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this rocking chair Luke 's father sat , ankles crossed and hands behind his head , stretched out to his full length . The air in the apartment was close and heavy . I trailed behind Luke and Claire , unsure of my place in any of this . <p> James Tomasi sat up straight . " I believe you said four-thirty . " <p> Claire flicked her head toward Luke and me . " Your son was busy making friends at the playground . It was all I could do to drag him away . " <p> " I 'm sure you had nothing to do with it . " He winked at Luke with half of his face , like a mime . " Is n't that right , chief ? " Luke put his finger in his mouth and looked at his mother . " All I 'm saying is somehow I managed to escape the office and get here on time . It would have been nice if you had attempted to do the same . " <p> " The sacrifices you make . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> James turned his head to the side and snorted like a horse . I studied him from my spot behind Luke . He was tall and rangy , long-fingered and loose-limbed . Tufts of wiry black hair sprouted from his knuckles . He wore a blue- and white-striped Oxford shirt , the top button open above the knot of his loosened tie . Over a once-broken nose two dark brown eyes retreated deep into their sockets . He had given Luke one of these eyes , but there were few other similarities between father and son ; Luke 's features were concise , while everything about James was elongated and roughly cut . Though tense , Luke 's father looked more than a little resigned , as if the outcome of whatever battle he was fighting had already been decided . He gestured at the briefcase resting beside the wicker chair . " I brought everything . " His eyes flickered over to Luke and me , and then back to Claire . " I do n't feel like there 's much either of us should say right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Claire took off her suit jacket and hung it on a hook near the entrance , and I saw for the first time how thin her arms were , how her skin was almost translucent , blue veins vivid as tattoos against the white skin . She squatted in front of her son . " Luke , your father and I have some things we need to talk about in private . Why do n't you and your new friend go to your room for just a little bit . Can you do that for me ? " <p> Inside the bedroom , the last thin bands of sunlight slid through slits in the drawn bamboo shades . Luke spun a giant freestanding globe , and let his fingers graze across oceans and continents smeared into one unbroken stream of color . An antique four-poster bed stood against one wall and a meticulously detailed dollhouse was wedged into a corner . Luke saw me looking at the dollhouse and said apologetically , " It 's for girls , but my mother says there 's nowhere else to put it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted faces and tiny clothes took tea and played chess . Each time I looked into the house , the dolls seemed to hold slightly different positions than before , yet I could never catch them in motion . Luke hopped onto a stuffed leather chair and kicked off his boat shoes . His feet did n't touch the floor , but he 'd fashioned a footrest out of several old hardcover mystery novels . His bare toes worried the cover of the top one as he announced : " My father does n't sleep here anymore but he still comes home for dinner sometimes . On Mondays and Thursdays , I think . My mother keeps changing the days . " <p> I did n't know what to say . " And tonight ? " <p> Luke frowned . " I asked my mother and she said they 're on strike in Delphi , so it 's anyone 's guess . Do you know what that means ? " <p> I wanted to say , It means your father probably is n't going to stay for dinner , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shrugged . Movement caught the corner of my eye , and I spun to face the dollhouse . " What is it ? " Luke said . The figurines had moved , I was sure of it . A woman hung by her feet from a chandelier , her little pink evening dress billowing out toward her head ; two men lay facedown on the floor in the parlor , their hands crossed behind their backs as though bound . " Oh , they always do that , " Luke said . He slid off the chair and took a step toward the house . I stepped behind him , and the house loomed large in its corner , and then I took another step and Luke 's bedroom and all its objects fell away . I stepped onto the porch  --  white-painted wood , it gave with a creak  --  and into the foyer , where Luke was already waiting for me . The smells of sea salt and pine drifted in through the open windows ; a grandfather clock kept the time . <p> " Where are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke said . " Rhode Island . My grandmother 's house . Want to meet her ? " <p> In the dining room , the woman still hung from the chandelier . Her porcelain head swiveled to fix us , and her upside-down mouth moved , but nothing came out . " I guess she 's not talking today . " The woman 's feet unhooked from the chandelier 's iron arms , and she crashed to the floor . " Well , " Luke said . " Another time , maybe . " In an adjacent nursery sat a crib , navy blue with white trim . A baby lay swaddled in blankets , its blank face unblinkingly regarding us . " That 's my mother , " Luke said . " They did n't make any more after her . " Dangling over baby Claire was a mobile of stars and quarter-moons . Bright light wiped away any scenery on the other side of the windows . <p> " Luke ? " <p> Suddenly the walls and floors and ceilings flew apart , and James stood in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that creepy old thing again ? " <p> " I was just showing it to Daniel , " Luke said , his face flushed and damp . <p> I was n't sure what I should say , so I kept my mouth shut . James looked in my direction , and then back at Luke . " It 's just that we might not be seeing as much of each other as we 're used to . What you need to understand is that it 's not because I want it to be that way . " <p> Luke paused for a moment , then said , " Who does ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Who wants it to be that way ? " <p> James tugged at the knot of his tie . " Nobody does , Luke . That 's just what 's going to happen . " <p> Dustlike quiet settled over the room , and Luke hung back , letting the dead space sag between them . I knew that each had disappointed the other , but I did n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach out and pinch James 's cheek or ruffle his hair , to slap Luke on the backside of his head and tell him to snap out of it , but I found myself unable to say or do anything . <p> James put on a fake smile . " Hey , cheer up , chief . It 's not the end of the world . Things wo n't be that different . " <p> You do n't have to lie , I wanted to say . <p> Luke shook his head . " They 're different now , " he said . <p> Claire 's voice suddenly echoed through the apartment : " You guys okay in there ? " <p> " No , the roof caved in , we 're all crushed to death , " James yelled back . " Christ , " he muttered under his breath , and then he kissed Luke 's forehead and left the room wiping his son 's sweat from his lips . Luke and I waited a moment before sneaking down the hall after him . From the doorway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly tender to Claire . He put his hand on her elbow but she jerked it away and walked into the kitchen . He stood alone in the foyer for a moment , and then he picked up his briefcase , and without another word he made his escape.Copyright 2009 by Brian DeLeeuw <br> Continues ...
