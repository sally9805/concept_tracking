To her mother she was never Alice Metzinger , the teacher and restaurant consultant who lived an exemplary life in Oregon . To her mother she was Kathy , a daughter she had last seen 23 years ago on a weekend visit from Brandeis University in Waltham , Massachusetts . The National Merit scholarship finalist , the winner of a Betty Crocker Homemaker award , the valedictorian of Marycrest , her Catholic high school in Colorado , Katherine Ann Power was the family 's " pride and joy , " says her older brother . She gave no hint that she was anything but a sweet and bookish child happy to be with the large Power brood . <P> That weekend in 1970 would be the last time anyone in her family would see her  --  until last Tuesday . In the intervening years , she would be the object . of the largest womanhunt in FBI history , one that kept her on the 10-most- wanted list for 14 years .

Power still felt the agony of her deeds , and she finally relinquished her freedom to the memory of a crime that would not let go of her conscience . <P> Through the years , the only memory the Power family had of their daughter was yellowing newspaper clips they had sorrowfully added to a family album the day their daughter-turned-radical robbed a bank . A policeman , the father of nine young children , was murdered . As the years passed , one brother feared that Kathy 's parents " would die before there was a chance to mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an FBI agent working on the case . She was negotiating with a woman who might be their daughter . What questions could she ask that only the real Katherine Power would know ? <P> Ask this mysterious woman who the neighbors were on one side of the house in which Kathy grew up , her parents said . What were their habits ? Who was the friend in eighth grade who had a life-threatening illness ? Who was the relative who used to take Kathy fishing ? The woman answered the questions correctly ; so on Sept. 5 , 1993 , her parents and siblings not only learned Katherine Power was alive , but also that she was married and had a teenage son . Katherine 's mother cried .
