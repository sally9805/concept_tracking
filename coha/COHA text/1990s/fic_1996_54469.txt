ContentsTWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE # ONE <p> Conway was sitting at his drafting table , stirring non-dairy creamer into his second cup of coffee of the day , when Jackman called . <p> " Barry , " he said . " Where the hell are those storyboards ? " <p> Conway put down his coffee . " Storyboards ? " <p> " For the Fairfax pitch . They were supposed to be on my desk this morning . " <p> Conway tried to collect his thoughts . " I gave that one to Hal to finish up . . . " <p> But even as he spoke , he remembered that Hal had called in sick yesterday . Which had left just him and Nora scrambling to keep up with.the rush of other work . The Fairfax pitch had simply slipped through the cracks . <p> Only a year or two ago , Hal 's absence would hardly have been missed . As a Group Art Director , Conway had managed a team of half a dozen artists . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle overloads . But that had been before the agency 's billings had begun to spiral downward , before Conway 's group had been downsized and downsized again . <p> These days , he was lucky to have any help at all . Judging from the flood of resumes that crossed his desk , and the desperate calls from former colleagues , he was lucky to have a job himself . <p> Another screw-up , and he might not have it much longer . <p> " I 'm sorry , Lou , " he said . " Hal 's , " Jackman said . " Badly . " <p> " You 'll have the boards tomorrow . First thing . " <p> He put the phone down and picked up his coffee . It was cold , but he drank it anyway . He would need it , to get through the day that stretched ahead of him . <p> He had worked late the previous night , then slept poorly , listening to his daughter cough in the next room . She had been coughing for what seemed like weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was pretty sure that it was asthma . <p> The disease of the ' 90s , he had said . It seemed like half of Melinda 's grade one class were packing inhalers along with their lunch . Now there would be one more . <p> He was sick himself , probably with the same bug that had downed Hal . His eyes were sore , his sinuses ached , and he had shooting pains in his back . But he could not afford to take any time off right now . <p> He needed this job . As much as he hated it , he needed to hang on to it , at least until the economy picked up and he had someplace else to go to . If the economy ever picked up . . . <p> Right now , they were living in a house that was worth less than their mortgage . His wife , Alice , had not had a pay increase in two years , and her company was about to make more staff cutbacks . The transmission on the station wagon was shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , and he had no idea how they would cover Melinda 's school fees next year . They might have to put her in the public system . But that did n't really bear thinking about , not with pushers in the playground and metal detectors at every door . <p> Soon he would get up and cross the room and sort through the mess on Hal 's desk for the Fairfax storyboards . But what he needed to do first was to rest his eyes , just for a moment . <p> He put his arms on the drafting table , then allowed his head to drift down on top of them . He closed his eyes . <p> Just for a moment . <p> TWO " Cogan , " the voice said . <p> He was lying on some kind of couch , between narrow metallic walls . A pattern hovered above him , intricate and multicolored . It took him a moment to realize that it was a face . Then he picked out the eyes , the mouth , the nose . The entire face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the lines and shapes remained . <p> " Wha ... ? " he said . His mouth felt clumsy , as if unaccustomed to speech . " What . . . ? " <p> " Cogan , " the voice said again , with a trace of impatience . " Dreamtime is over . " <p> It was a woman 's voice , a woman 's face . As she leaned closer , he could read the fine bone structure beneath the tattoos . Or was it some kind of paint ? He saw that her head was bald , and covered in the same patterns . <p> " What . . . ? " he said . " Where . . . ? " <p> The woman 's voice softened . " You must have been in deep , " she said . " Real deep . Try sitting up . " <p> He sat up on the couch and looked around him . He had been lying in some kind of capsule in a pink-walled room . There were five other capsules in the room , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced down into the nearest one . It was filled with a white mist . Through the mist he could glimpse a tattooed face . <p> " What is this place ? " he asked . " Some kind of hospital ? " Although even as he spoke , he knew that it was not a hospital . <p> The woman shook her head slightly . " Real deep , " she said , again . " Happened to me once . I was a foot soldier in the siege of Troy . Inside the horse and everything . Got so into it , I did n't know where I was when I woke up . But it comes back , real quick . " <p> She reached out a hand to help him from the capsule . He climbed out and rocked unsteadily on his feet . <p> " Who are you ? " he asked . " What am I doing here ? " <p> " Harper , " she said . " Harper Jennings . Your watch-partner . You really do n't remember ? " <p> " Watch-partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where I am , or how I got here . I do n't understand anything . " <p> " You were here all along , Cogan . In a moment , you 'll remember . " <p> " My name is n't Cogan , " he said . " It 's Conway . Barry Conway . " <p> " Where were you , anyway ? " she asked . She walked around the capsule and touched a control . A screen lit up . " Late Twentieth Century Earth . I 've never been there . Did n't appeal . " <p> " Been there ? " <p> " In the dream . " <p> " What dream ? What are you talking about ? " <p> " You 've been asleep , Cogan . For two years , or two hundred years , depending on how you want to look at it . And while you were asleep , you dreamed you were someone called Barry Conway . But now it 's time to wake up . " <p> " That 's crazy , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry Conway . I am Barry Conway . " <p> " Your name is Cogan Phillips , " she said . " You 're a life-support tech on the starship Cool Canary , carrying a load of colonists to Barnard 's World . You 've been in cold-sleep for the past two years , hooked up to a dream-machine , and so have I. But now it 's our watch . " <p> " Starship ? " he echoed . " Cold-sleep ? Dream-machine ? Do you know how crazy all this sounds ? " <p> She gave a little gasp of exasperation and turned away from him . " Mirror , " she said , pointing to the wall opposite them . " Full-length . " <p> The pink wall glowed white , then became a shiny mirror . He gazed for a moment , fascinated and appalled , at his own heavily tattooed face . And then he was falling toward it . He put out a hand to stop himself . And plunged right into the mirror , all the way through to the darkness on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a hand on his arm . He opened his eyes . He saw Nora standing beside him . <p> " Nora , " he said . " What time is it ? " <p> " Eleven-thirty , " she said . " I was down in typography , and when I came back you were sleeping . I hated to wake you up , but I thought you 'd want me to ... " <p> " I would ave , yeah . Thanks . " <p> Nora was just a year out of art school . She still needed a lot of reassurance . <p> He stretched his arms . " Jesus , " he said . " I had the strangest dream . Like science fiction . I was on this spaceship . . . " He shook his head . " Just crazy stuff . " <p> " Maybe you 've been watching too much Star Trek . " " Me ? I never watch that sci-fi crap . " <p> " Me neither , " Nora said . <p> " I mean , what does it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nora said . " Nothing at all . " <p> Although , he reminded himself , there had been a time when he had been quite infatuated with Star Trek and similar movies and TV shows , entranced with the bold new worlds they revealed to him . As a teenager , he had soaked up hundreds and hundreds of hours of the stuff . <p> Now it had come back to haunt him . <p> " Would you do me a favor ? Go find me Hal 's work-up on the Fairfax pitch , while I get another coffee . " <p> " Is that the cereal commercial ? " <p> " Feminine hygiene . At least , I think it was . " <p> He closed his eyes briefly in thought , and saw a brightly decorated face staring back at him . His eyes jerked open and his head snapped back . <p> " You all right , Barry ? " Nora asked . <p> " I 'm fine , " he said . " And this is another perfect day . " <p> He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> FOUR " Cogan , " the voice said . It was a man 's voice , a rich baritone . " We need to talk , Cogan . " <p> Shit , Conway thought . Not again . <p> He was lying on a couch in a dimly lit room . He could not see anyone else in the room with him . <p> He had stayed at work until ten that night , finishing up the Fairfax storyboards . He had left the work on Jackman 's desk , then taken the elevator down to the ground floor , where the security guard had called him a cab . The cab had arrived and he had stepped out through the door and . . . <p> And what ? He could not recall . <p> I 'm asleep , he thought . Nodding off in the cab , or maybe back home with Alice . <p> Deliberately , he pinched himself on the thigh . He felt a tingle of pain . But he was still lying on the couch in the dimly lit room . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Pinching yourself wo n't help at all . " <p> " Where are you ? " he asked , peering into the shadows in the corners of the room . " I ca n't see you . " <p> The voice laughed , a touch theatrically . <p> " I 'm everywhere in this ship , Cogan . And nowhere . " <p> " Do n't tell me , " he said . " Let me guess . You 're the ship 's computer , right ? " <p> " So it 's coming back to you . " <p> " What 's coming back to me is every dumb movie I ever wasted my time watching . " <p> " This is remarkable , " the voice said . " A sustained delusion of remarkable self-consistency . In all the years we have been using the dream-machines , we have never recorded such an extraordinarily persistent re-adaption trauma . But to answer your question : I 'm not exactly a computer . More like a community of parallel processors . Although for the moment , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he said . " I do n't believe any of it . " <p> " What do you believe ? " <p> " That I 'm dreaming this . Or else going nuts . " <p> " Going nuts , " the voice echoed . " Not how I would usually describe it . But again , close enough . You are indeed going nuts , Cogan . You are in the grip of a psychotic fugue . A full-fledged retreat from reality . " <p> " My name is Conway , " he said . " Stop calling me Cogan . " <p> " There is no Conway . There never was a Conway , only the construct you created in interaction with the dream-machine . For two years you lived the life of this fictional person , relishing the artless joys of a simpler , less stressful historical period , an escape fantasy of bucolic late-Twentieth Century Earth . But it 's time to come back , Cogan . To let go of your delusion and face reality . " <p> With these words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out at the stars , a million bright stars scattered across a deep blackness . <p> " This is reality , " the voice said . " This harsh and magnificent universe through which we must travel in our fragile craft , buffeted by the winds between the stars , pounded mercilessly with hard radiation . . . this is the reality from which you seek to flee . " <p> He looked out on the stars , the bright and terrible stars . And felt himself falling into them , falling unstoppably into that awful darkness . <p> FIVE " Barry . " <p> He felt a hand on his shoulder , shaking him . <p> " What ? " he said . <p> He sat up in bed . It was still dark . The alarm clock on the bedside table told him that it was three in the morning . <p> " You were screaming , " Alice said . " Screaming your head off . I thought I should wake you . " <p> " Screaming ? " <p> " You must have been having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , I really was . " <p> " Is something worrying you ? " she asked . <p> " Nothing . It was just a bad dream , that 's all . " <p> " Because you 've been awfully preoccupied these past few days . " <p> " I 'm fine , " he said . " Just fine . " <p> He turned away from her and went back to sleep . <p> SIX " Cogan . " <p> The face looming over him was covered in lines and shapes . In the soft light glowing from the wall he saw that she was naked , and that he was , too . They were lying on a thin mat spread out on the floor of a tiny cubicle . <p> " Harper ? " <p> " You remember now ? " <p> " No , " he said . " I mean , I remember you from the first time I had this crazy dream . But I do n't remember anything from before that . " <p> She reached out her hand to touch him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , " he said . But he felt himself responding to her . <p> " We have an hour before our watch , " she said , straddling him . " Let 's not waste it . It 's been a long time . " <p> SEVEN " You did a nice job on the Fairfax pitch , " Jackman said . " Too bad we did n't get it . " <p> " We did n't ? " <p> Jackman put down his fork and wiped his mouth with his napkin . <p> " It was always a long shot . They were basically happy with the job Belton Robbins were doing for them . Said they wanted a new approach , but really they wanted same-old same-old . Usual story . But it 's too bad all the same , because we needed some new billings . " <p> Conway put down his own fork . He had not really been eating anyway , just moving the brightly colored pieces of salad around on his plate . He waited for the other shoe to fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , " Jackman said . " Before the rumors start flying . We 're looking at another consolidation . " <p> " Consolidation ? " <p> " Your group with Tumer 's . Makes a lot of sense . We get to condense studio space , cut overhead . . . I can show you the spreadsheet . It 's hard to argue with the numbers . " <p> " And who . . . " For a moment , Conway could not bring himself to ask the question , but then he did anyway . " Who will be group head ? " <p> " That 's still up in the air . But I 'm pulling for you , Barry . Do n't doubt it . " <p> Conway doubted it . But even if he did have Jackman 's backing , he still did n't care much for his chances . Turner Woodley was an industry veteran , a multiple award-winner , creator of dozens of striking campaigns . <p> But then again , the man was a drunk , sometimes an obnoxious one at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency was serious about cutting costs , what better place to start than Turner 's hefty compensation package ? <p> He sat back , appalled at his own thoughts . Turner Woodley was an old friend , unfailingly generous over the years with his time and his advice . They had gone fishing , played poker , gathered their families together at Thanksgiving . Turner had helped him get this job . <p> Turner had two kids still in college , and another who was in and out of private psychiatric hospitals . He had a big house in Westchester and a summer place on the Cape , both mortgaged to the hilt . He was fifty-four years old , and looked older . If Turner lost his job he would probably never work again . <p> " Christ , " he said . " I hope it does n't come to that . " <p> " But it will , " Jackman said . <p> " Maybe we could work together . . . " <p> " Too many cooks . Too few efficiencies . Of course , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave Conway a searching look . <p> " Oh , I want it , " he said . He felt something rise in his throat . " I really want it , Lou . " <p> He got up from the table . " Excuse me a minute , " he said . " I 'll be right back . " <p> He headed for the washroom door . <p> EIGHT " In here , Cogan . " <p> He was walking down a metal corridor , his boots echoing dully on the floor . He was carrying a pack on his back . Harper was standing ahead of him , motioning to an open doorway . <p> He followed her into a large open space , filled with row upon row of capsules . Different colored paths snaked through the rows , allowing access to the capsules . <p> " Yellow 27 , " Harper said , pointing . " Right over there . " <p> She raced up the path , and he followed behind her . He was panting by the time he caught up with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the capsule . <p> " Biosign alert , " she told him . " Low blood pressure reading . " <p> He looked down into the capsule . " You mean , this person is sick ? " <p> " She maybe , " Harper said . " Although fifty to one it 's the diagnostics on the blink . Check it out . " <p> " Check what out ? " <p> " Oh come on , " she said . " Come on . " <p> He stared back at her blankly . Exasperated , she reached over and flipped open his backpack , producing a thin metal tool with a clear plastic bulb on top . She inserted the end of the tool into a small hole beside the screen . The bulb glowed orange . <p> " Faulty memory , " she said . " Pass me a new unit , will you ? " <p> Preoccupied , he failed to respond . He was looking around him at the rows of capsules . <p> " All these people , they 're crew members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Cold-sleep all the way . They do n't get a wake-up call until we reach Barnard 's . " <p> " And they 're all dreaming ? " <p> " Like there 's no tomorrow . " She shook her head slowly . " I thought it was coming back to you . You did n't have any problem remembering before . . . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Harper , " he said . " I 'm not Cogan . I do n't know where he 's gone , or what I 'm doing here . . . " I 'm apologizing to a figure in a dream . " But that 's how it is . " <p> " What use are you to me like this ? " she asked . " You 're no use to me at all . " <p> He saw her eyes fill up with tears . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said , again . And then he turned and ran away from her , through the maze of sleepers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He was standing in the middle of the road , inches away from the hood of a cab . The driver of the cab was leaning out of the window and screaming at him . Behind the cab , other cars honked their impatience . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't see you . " <p> " You want to kill yourself , take the subway , " the cabbie said . " Now get out of my way . " <p> He crossed to the other side of the street and stood staring up at an unfamiliar office building . What was he doing here ? <p> He remembered then : Dr. Graves . He had come here to see Dr. Graves , the psychiatrist recommended by his family doctor . <p> He walked to the entrance of the building and stared in through the revolving glass doors . He saw a lobby , elevators , people milling around . He saw a million bright stars . <p> " You going in or what ? " <p> He turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or were those tattoos ? <p> He looked back through the door . The stars were gone . " In , " he croaked . " I 'm going in . " He pushed on the door and entered the building . <p> TEN Dr. Graves had a dark beard and dark , thinning hair . His expression was serious , almost mournful , as Conway told his story . <p> " Are you under some stress at work , Mr. Conway ? " <p> " Some , I guess . Is n't everyone ? " <p> " You work long hours ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And worry about your job security ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What about your relationships , Mr. Conway ? How are you getting along with your wife ? " <p> " Fine . At least , when we get to see each other , everything 's fine . " <p> " When did you last have sexual relations with your wife ? " <p> " Sexual relations ? " The question momentarily startled him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or two ago . " <p> " A week or two ? " <p> " Well , maybe more like a month . What with both of us working so hard , sometimes it 's hard to find the energy . . . " <p> " A month . " <p> " Or two . What are you suggesting ? " <p> " I 'm not suggesting anything . Simply exploring . What did you think I was suggesting ? " <p> " That I have some kind of sexual problem . " <p> " Does n't everyone , Mr. Conway ? But no , I do n't believe that . Your relations with this ah . . . " <p> " Harper , " Conway said , flushing a dull red . <p> " Harper , thank you . Your fantasized sexual relations with Harper are only one element of a much larger and more complex wish fulfillment . " <p> " Wish fulfillment ? You think I like what 's happening to me ? I hate it . I hate every moment of it . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that is nothing to be ashamed of . Tell me , are you a frequent reader of science fiction ? " <p> " A reader ? I 'm not much of a reader of anything . But I used to watch a lot of it . TV , drive-in movies , like that . " <p> " You enjoyed it ? " <p> " Oh , sure . The future . Seeing the future , bright and shiny and clean , I could n't get enough of that . Just the idea that there would be a future , that we would get out of this century alive , it did n't even matter what kind of future . But I liked the space stuff the best . It was so . . . " <p> " So ? " <p> " Optimistic , " he said . " The idea that we would n't blow ourselves to pieces , would n't choke on our own pollution . That we would not only survive , but endure . Go out there and conquer these fantastic new worlds , using our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the optimism that I liked most of all . " <p> " And you still watch these shows ? " <p> " Not for years . I outgrew them , was what happened . I started dating , I went to art school , I traveled . I got a job , got married , bought a house , had a kid . I did n't have time for that stuff , anymore . It did n't have anything to do with my life . It seemed silly . " <p> " Silly ? " <p> " The whole idea . That we could go into space . That we should even want to . If you think about it , it 's obscene . Children starving and we 're spending money on space shuttles . " <p> " And yet at some level , " Dr. Graves said , " you have not let go of your dreams . " <p> " Maybe not . " He shook his head . " I was hoping you were going to tell me that this was all chemical . Some bad chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are , " Dr. Graves said . " Not bad chemicals exactly , but rather chemical imbalances . When you come under stress , that triggers the release of certain neurotransmitters , which in turn facilitate the psychotic break , allowing this bizarre ideation to emerge from your unconscious mind . " <p> " But which comes first ? The crazy ideas ? Or the bad chemicals ? " <p> " We can debate etiology if you like , Mr. Conway . But it does n't really help us much . The real question is how to manage the situation . A decade or two ago , we would have spent many hours together discussing your ideation . But today , quite frankly , I do n't have the time or the interest , and you do n't have sufficient medical coverage . Fortunately there is an alternative . " " An alternative ? " <p> Dr. Graves opened the drawer of his desk . He produced a container of purple pills . " These are new on the market . A really excellent anti-psychotic . I happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and I 'll write you a prescription for more . " <p> Conway took the container and stared at it dubiously . " These pills will stop the delusions ? " <p> " Stop them cold . Take one every morning and evening . If you feel another episode coming on , take another . They 'll bring you back to Earth in a hurry . " <p> ELEVEN Conway leaned back in his chair and stretched his arms . The layout was finished , and it looked great . He felt tired , but it was a good tired . <p> Since being appointed head of the newly combined art group , Conway 's productivity had been on an upward swing . After struggling for so long with limited resources , it was a relief to have a full department again . And although the work load had increased , too , it was simply a matter of working smarter . Turner Woodley had been a notoriously poor manager , and his former assistants had responded enthusiastically to Conway 's new leadership . <p> It was too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up and take him out for lunch . And when the economy picked up , he would be able to throw a few freelance assignments his way . <p> Actually , from his point of view , the economy was already picking up . Jackman had come through for him , swinging him a raise to accompany his new responsibilities . Not a lot of money , but enough to fix the station wagon and cover Melanie 's school fees . Also , Alice had survived yet another round of cutbacks at her job . So things were looking up . <p> But the best news of all was the end of the dreams . Since he started taking the purple pills , he had stayed firmly rooted in the here-and-now . No more sleep capsules or dream-machines or echoing starship walls or tattooed ladies . . . <p> He felt a sudden , unexpected pang , thinking about Harper . She had seemed so real . It had all seemed real , at least while it was happening , but Harper most of all . He almost missed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around him , wondering who it was . He had thought that everyone else had gone home hours ago . He could see no one in the room . <p> " Conway , " the voice again , naggingly familiar . <p> He robbed his eyes , but still could see no one . <p> " Or should I say Cogan ? " <p> He got up from his desk and pulled on his jacket , possessed by an urgent need to get out of the room . <p> The walls of the corridor glowed a soft metallic pink . The elevator door looked different , too , sleek and ultra-modem and smaller than he remembered . <p> When the elevator arrived , he got in . A heavily tattooed man nodded to him , and he nodded back . They rode downward in silence . <p> He had not taken his pill that morning . He had been about to , and then Melanie had distracted him with some question about her birthday party , and it had slipped his mind . Everything had been going so well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't real , he told himself , as he stepped out into the lobby . None of this is real . <p> Except that there was no lobby , only another corridor , this one a dull blue . There was no front door leading to the street , only a large metal hatch . <p> " What do you think you 're doing , Cogan ? " <p> This time he did not look for the source of the voice . He knew that the voice was in his head . <p> " I 'm going home , " he said . <p> He stepped up toward the hatch . <p> " That door leads directly into space , " the voice said . " Open it , and you 'll be sucked out . " <p> " The door leads to the street , " Conway said . But he hesitated , all the same . <p> " You 've been in fugue for weeks , " the voice said . " Now you 're coming out of it . You 're remembering that you are Cogan Phillips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your unconscious mind still resists that knowledge . It would rather kill you than accept the truth . " <p> " No , " he said , shaking his head . " You 've got it all wrong . " <p> " I 've scanned the dreams from your cold-sleep , " the voice said . " They are of an astounding mundanity . They reveal to me a life lived with no breadth of vision , with no higher purpose than getting through the day-to-day grind . A life filled with small betrayals of yourself and the people around you , with meaningless victories and pitiful defeats . Here you are doing important work , helping humanity populate the stars , building a better future for everyone . And yet you prefer to wallow in this absurd mire of your own creation . Why , Cogan ? Why ? " <p> " Because it 's my life , " he said . " That 's why . " <p> He leaned forward to press the button that would release the hatch . <p> " Cogan ? " It was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing Cogan ? " <p> He turned to see Harper , coming down the corridor toward him . <p> " You 'll kill yourself , " she said . " You 'll kill me . Do n't do it , Cogan . " <p> He paused , frozen , his finger on the button . <p> Harper was reaching out her hand toward him . " Come back to our quarters , " she said . " We still have some time before our next watch . " <p> He stared at her finely etched features , her glorious tattoos . He took a step toward her . As he moved , his hand brushed against the pocket of his jacket , and he felt the outline of the pill container inside . <p> Take one if you feel another episode coming on . That was what Dr. Graves had told him . Why had n't he done so ? <p> " Cogan , " Harper was saying . " I 've missed you , Cogan . " <p> She was still holding out her hand . He reached out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbled in his pocket for the pill container . His hands were shaking so badly that when he opened it , he spilled the contents on the floor . He got down on his hands and knees and picked up a pill . <p> " What are you doing ? " Harper asked . <p> " He 's acting out of his delusion , " the voice of the computer explained . " I believe he thinks he 's taking some kind of medication . " <p> Conway popped a pill in his dry mouth and tried to swallow it . He gagged momentarily . Then the pill went down . <p> He stood up and faced Harper . <p> " I 've taken an anti-psychotic drug " he said . " In a minute or two , all this will fade away . You , too , Harper . I 'm sorry . " <p> He wondered why he was apologizing . <p> " Cogan , " she said . But her voice was fainter now , it came to him as if from a great distance . And her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was staring at a Filipino woman , one of the building 's night maintenance staff . She was staring back at him in some concern . <p> " You all right ? " she asked . <p> " Fine , " he croaked . " Now . " <p> He turned back to the hatch . It was fading out rapidly now , so that he could discern beneath it the outlines of the front door . <p> " Do n't , " said the voice of the computer . It was slurred and indistinct . " Open . That .
