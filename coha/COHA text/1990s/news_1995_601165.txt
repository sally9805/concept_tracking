<p> A new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup poll finds that Americans fall into four groups when it comes to planning for retirement . But no matter which group you 're in , and no matter how much you make , experts say there are five basic steps to take toward a comfortable retirement : 1 . Know how much money you 'll need . The worksheet on this page will give you a start . <p> 2 . Take full advantage of savings plans that offer tax breaks - 401(k)s , IRAs and annuities . <p> 3 . Make monthly contributions to your savings plan . Religiously . <p> 4 . Divide your money between stocks and bonds . Rule of thumb : Put a percentage equal to your age in bonds , the rest in stocks . <p> 5 . If all this seems confusing , just save at least 10% of your income . <p> Source : USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll , conducted April 21-23 , of 572 adults ages 30 and older who are not retired . Margin of error is +/-5 perentage points . THE CONTENTED REALISTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.C. Job : Human resources manager Personal : Married , two children in college Household income : $ 70,000 <p> " I do n't think any of us do as much as we should . " CHARACTERISTICS : These are the best prepared for retirement - both psychologically and financially , in part because they are the wealthiest . Almost seven in 10 - more than twice the national average - earn more than $ 50,000 a year . And only 1% earn less than $ 20,000 , compared with 19% nationwide . But being a Contented Realist involves more than just income : <p>  --  57% , or nearly twice the U.S. average , saved more than $ 5,000 last year . <p>  --  84% have an employer-sponsored retirement plan , the most of any group . <p>  --  50% say they 're knowledgeable about financial planning and that they have a written financial plan for retirement . <p>  --  79% are n't worried about not having enough money in retirement . That 's more than five times the number of non-worriers in any other group . <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement plan to be their major sources of retirement income . And they 're the least likely of all the groups to rely on Social Security or part-time work . <p> PLAN : Howard , who counsels Wilson County employees on retirement planning , practices what she preaches . <p> She takes full advantage of county savings plans , which let her avoid paying income taxes on the money she saves . She and her husband , Randolph , a police officer , religiously put pay raises into savings " so we never missed them . " They are saving 22% of income . <p> " We would all love to have clients like that , " says Chicago financial planner Larry Johnson . <p> If there 's a weakness in the Howards ' habits , it 's that they did n't start saving until about 10 years ago . They missed out on years of investment growth . <p> Consider : One person puts $ 2,000 a year into an individual retirement account from age 25 through 35 , then stops . Someone else starts making $ 2,000-a-year contributions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts earn 8% a year . At age 65 , the person who started at 25 and contributed $ 20,000 will have $ 335,000 . But the person who started at 35 and contributed $ 60,000 , will have only $ 247,000 . THE WOEFULLY UNPREPARED  --  24% Winona Englesby , 36 <p> Home : Fruitland , Idaho Job : Unemployed Personal : Divorced Household income : Less than $ 10,000 <p> " My mate and I worked together , and the job went belly up . So both of us had to use our bank accounts to live on . " CHARACTERISTICS : This group is by far the poorest financially , the least likely to have a job-sponsored retirement plan and , understandably , thinks it does n't have enough money to save for retirement . Only 7% earn more than $ 50,000 a year - compared with 35% in the country overall - while almost half earn less than $ 20,000 . That 's why : <p>  --  78% strongly agree they do n't have enough money to save for retirement - 30 points higher than even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be something else to spend money on rather than save it . <p>  --  63% say they contributed nothing to retirement savings in the past year . <p>  --  39% say they expect their standard of living to be worse in retirement than it is right now , vs. 55% of Worriers . But the difference probably reflects the much lower income the Woefully Unprepared already have . <p>  --  Nearly 4 in 10 see Social Security as a major source of retirement income , and a quarter are counting on part-time work to make ends meet . <p> PLAN : There 's not a lot Englesby can do while she does n't have a job . " I used to worry an awful lot about it . I finally gave up and decided it 's better not to worry , " she says . " I do n't want to have to ever quit work . It keeps you young . " <p> Once Englesby starts working again - she 's a welder - she should set aside as much as possible each month . " Save until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for Quest for Value , a mutual fund company . <p> And even the gloomiest forecasts on Social Security say it will survive for the people who need it the most . <p> Already , Social Security favors lower-income workers . The lower your pay before retirement , the larger percentage of your income will be replaced by Social Security benefits . Contributing : Anne Carey THE CAUTIOUS OPTIMISTS  --  18% Michelle Hartlein , 41 <p> Home : Evansville , Ind . Personal : Single Household income : Less than $ 25,000 <p> " I hope like heck that there 's Social Security money available when I 'm ready for it , but I 'm not counting on it . ' CHARACTERISTICS : This group presents a striking contrast with the Worriers . Although just 18% earn more than $ 50,000 a year - and nearly a third earn less than $ 20,000 - they 've taken prudent steps to prepare for retirement . In many respects , this group , despite its lower income , looks very similar to the Contented Realists . That 's because : <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost three times more than the Worriers - and 29% have a retirement plan . <p>  --  34% saved more than $ 5,000 last year - twice as many as Worriers . Just 30% saved nothing last year , compared with 40% of Worriers . <p>  --  This group is almost as likely as the Contented Realists to say that savings and investments will be a major source of retirement income . And they 're much less likely than the Worriers to rely on Social Security or part-time jobs . <p> PLAN : Hartlein is limited by income , not desire . She manages to set aside $ 500 to $ 1,000 a year and has about $ 4,000 saved for retirement . <p> Hartlein has her savings in an IRA - a smart move because she can deduct contributions from her income taxes . <p> But financial planners say she should double her contribution to take full advantage of the tax deduction . Someone in the 28% tax bracket can save $ 2,000 with an out-of-pocket cost of only $ 1,440 . <p> Hartlein also should move her IRA from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like CDs because they 're safe . But interest rates are low . <p> A blue-chip stock fund would provide a much better return with just a bit more risk . From 1945-94 , stocks produced an average annual gain of 11.8% , says Ned Davis Research . During that time , bonds had an average return of 5.2% , and inflation averaged 4.3% . <p> Inflation 's power to erode savings , says Columbus , Ohio , planner Gary Vawter , " is the most difficult concept we have to explain to people . " THE WORRIERS  --  32% Gilles Beaudoin , 38 <p> Home : New Britain , Conn . Job : Machinist Personal : Married , three children , 18 , 16 , 14 Household income : $ 50,000 to $ 65,000 <p> " I do put money away , but something comes up and we end up using it . ... Things do n't look good for baby boomers . ' CHARACTERISTICS : This group frets a lot about retirement - but uses little of its considerable income to save for it . Even though almost four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half say they do n't make enough to save . Worse still , two-thirds " strongly " agree that " there always seems to be something else to spend your money on rather than save it for the future . " Other Worrier attributes : <p>  --  33% express total ignorance about retirement planning , about the same as the Woefully Unprepared and much greater than the other two groups . <p>  --  98% say they are worried about not having enough money in retirement , more than the Woefully Unprepared . <p>  --  55% - the most of any group - expect their standard of living in retirement to be worse than it is now . <p>  --  More than a third of this group expect to rely on Social Security as a major source of retirement income , about the same number as the much poorer Woefully Unprepared . And about a quarter of Worriers say they 'll have to work part time in retirement - about twice as many as Cautious Optimists . <p> PLAN : Beaudoin 's situation illustrates many baby boomers ' troubles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide , have only about $ 11,000 saved for retirement in an individual retirement account and a 401(k) at Nancy 's job . Beaudoin has no retirement plan through his job , and his salary can vary by as much as $ 15,000 a year , depending on overtime . On top of everything else , he 's more worried about putting their oldest daughter through college than saving for retirement . <p> People like Beaudoin must learn to pay themselves first - every single paycheck . Experts say he could start by putting as little as $ 25 a month into a mutual fund of growth stocks . Most fund companies will take the money automatically from a checking account . <p> That way , he 'll " look at it as a monthly bill as opposed to a luxury , " says Chicago financial planner Larry Johnson . <p> Committing to spend the same amount of money on stocks every month helps keep your average share price down . When stock prices are up , you 're buying fewer shares ; when prices are down , you 're buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as allowed to her 401(k) . <p> And when Beaudoin 's daughter finishes college , he should take the school money and start saving it . <p> " They should have a budget windfall at the end of her college , " Johnson says .
