When it comes to achieving in school , Za'kettha Blaylock knows that even dreaming of success can mean living a nightmare . She would , above all things , like to work hard , go to college and become a doctor . But to many other black 14-year-old girls in her corner of Oakland , these ideas are anathema . The telephone rings in her family 's modest apartment , and the anonymous voice murmurs daggers . " We 're gon na kill you , " the caller says . Za'kettha knows the threat comes from a gang of black girls , one that specializes not in drugs or street fights but in terrorizing bright black students . " They think that just because you 're smart , " says the eighth-grader , " they can go around beating you up . " <P> Of all the obstacles to success that inner-city black students face , the most surprising  --  and discouraging  --  may be those erected by their own peers . Many children must also cope with broken families , inadequate schools and crumbling communities that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the ridicule of peers cuts most deeply of all . Students like Za'kettha find themselves reviled as " uppity , " as trying to " act white , " because many teenagers have come to equate black identity with alienation and indifference . " I used to go home and cry , " says Tachelle Ross , 18 , a senior at Oberlin High in Ohio . " They called me white . I do n't know why . I 'd say , ' I 'm just as black as you are . ' " <P> The phrase " acting white " has often been the insult of choice used by blacks who stayed behind against those who moved forward . Once it was supposed to invoke the image of an African American who had turned his back on his people and community . But the phrase has taken an ominous turn . Today it rejects all the iconography of white middle-class life : a good job , a nice home , conservative clothes and a college degree . <P> In the smaller world of high school , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Promising black students are ridiculed for speaking standard English , showing an interest in ballet or theater , having white friends or joining activities other than sports . " They 'll run up to you and grab your books and say , ' I 'll tear this book up , ' " says Shaquila Williams , 12 , a sixth-grader at Webster Academy in East Oakland . " They 'll try and stop you from doing your work . " Honor students may be rebuked for even showing up for class on time . <P> The pattern of abuse is a distinctive variation on the nerd bashing that almost all bright , ambitious students  --  no matter what their color  --  face at some point in their young lives . The anti-achievement ethic championed by some black youngsters declares formal education useless ; those who disagree and study hard face isolation , scorn and violence . While educators have recognized the existence of an anti-achievement culture for at least a decade , it has only recently emerged as a dominant theme among the troubles facing urban schools .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
