The world is dark , and you 're in it . As you stand waiting for first light , anticipation ripples along your skin . Optimism runs high , but it 's an emotion based on faith ; this is only your second season as a turkey hunter , and you 've yet to pull the trigger . Your listening spot is the crest of a steep ridge you 've never seen except on paper . You found it during an armchair expedition one evening last winter , while poring over a stack of topo maps . The place has pulled at you ever since . It caught your attention because three narrow , steep-sided spurs jut out from the ridge 's north slope like a chicken 's foot . It 's likely turkey country , according to everything you 've read and heard . The hollows between the spurs provide sheltered roosting places , and the spurs provide access to the main ridge . You 'd intended to scout the place , of course . But February was short and March was busy , and with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April is here , and it 's time to hunt . Daylight grows in the east , and finally the light reaches the proper intensity . It 's gobbling time . But the turkeys of Chicken-Foot Ridge must not know it , because nobody utters a peep . Maybe there are n't any birds here , you think with some panic . Maybe you made the wrong choice . Maybe you should have gone back to Blowout Mountain , where you saw the two flocks of turkeys last deer season . Two barred owls have been calling far down the valley , but no turkeys have answered them . You 're about ready to try another spot when you decide to try a hoot or two yourself . New as you are to turkey hunting , you 're even newer to nuances like owl hooting , and you 're still pretty self-conscious about trying to sound like a nocturnal bird . But the only witnesses out here are trees , so you square your shoulders , draw in a breath and roll out an abbreviated , four-note call : Hoo-hoo-ho-hooo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shocks " him . Train whistles , thunder , airplanes and even gunshots can elicit the same response . But no turkey has ever been more shocked than you at this moment , because not one but three gobblers immediately answer your tentative hoot . All are close to your position on the main ridge , but they 're spread out . From the sound , there 's one bird on each of the chicken toes . You 're trying to decide which one to go after , and not making much progress , when the situation gets even more confusing . Two more gobblers crank up on the main ridge , one in each direction , neither one more than 400 yards away . Now there are five gobblers calling back and forth , and you 're pretty much surrounded . What would you do in a situation like that , still wet behind the ears , hunting unfamiliar territory , ringed by five close , talkative gobblers ? Not , I hope , what I did when it happened to me in 1978 . I spent the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in indecisive zigzags , heading first toward one turkey and then another . I never got more than 100 feet from my starting point the whole time , though I must have covered two miles . By the time I forced myself to pick a single gobbler , all five birds had flown down and the party was over . I heard a few scattered gobbles over the next three hours , but the opportunity was lost . I failed to seize the moment , and it cost me the days . I can laugh about it now , but my sense of humor comes from the perspective of time . That day , it was n't a bit funny . My inexperience cost me a nearly certain gim me but taught a valuable lesson . Let 's go back to that awkward owl hoot and see what I might have done to give the hunt a better outcome . The four-note hoot was the only thing I did right , aside from map-scouting to find the spot in the first place . Many beginners get so caught up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea is not to fill the woods with owl music , but to hear a gobbler when he answers . If you 're busy making noise , you may not hear the turkeys . The most effective hoot  --  and the same applies to crow calls or any other artificial sound made to get a turkey to gobble  --  is loud and abrupt . Make the call , then shut up and listen . One of the identifying characteristics of a good turkey hunter is the ability to make quick decisions based on the information he has in any given situation . My best play on Chicken-Foot Ridge would have been to sit down right where I had hooted and to have called to all five gobblers . None was more than a quarter-mile away , and that 's usually within reasonable working distance . Getting closer to any of those birds would have taken me farther from the other four , and I would have been trading a decent setup on five gobblers for a possibly better setup on one . Because I did n't know what obstacles might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have stayed put and started calling . One or more of the turkeys would have probably come to visit . Usually , though , your morning is n't going to be quite that target-rich . Let 's take a much more common scenario : Two , maybe three turkeys are gobbling from the roost , and you need to decide which to go after . But how ? Distance is one obvious factor . If Gobbler A is a half-mile away across a steep , deep valley and Gobbler B is 100 yards farther along the same ridge you 're standing on , it 's not difficult to make a decision . But do n't base your decision entirely on distance . If the more-distant gobbler seems more eager , or is gobbling much more than the closer one , he might be the best one to go after . Most veteran turkey hunters will take a hot gobbler at a half-mile over a disinterested one at 100 yards any day . Terrain can be a factor , too . " Knowing the lay of the land may be half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call manufacturer with 27 years of turkey hunting experience . " There might be something between you and the gobbler he does n't want to cross  --  a fence , a creek , a ditch , a thicket or something else . And if he does n't want to cross it , there 's nothing you can do to make him . " Knowing about these potential obstacles can mean the difference between a successful hunt and just another frustrating conversation with a gobbler . If the closest gobbler is on the other side of a creek or clear-cut and the distant one is in open woods , once again it might be better to go to the more-distant bird . When you have two or more birds to choose from , the terrain and other factors can weigh in your decision , but there are no hard and fast rules . You have to assess the situation and make an educated guess , and you must do it quickly . Seconds are precious at gobbling time . It 's to your advantage to move in and set up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set up on a gobbler is to use the buddy system . With two hunters , one should be designated as the caller and the other should be the shooter . When setting up on a bird , the caller should position himself about 40 yards behind the shooter . This will distract the bird , because when a gobbler comes to call , he will be looking for a hen . When the gobbler walks within range of the shooter , the tom 's attention will still be focused on the calls he hears in the distance , and not on the camouflaged blob right in front of him . When you 're moving into position try to get as close to the turkey as possible without spooking him . This can be tricky , and the advice you 've heard about always getting within 100 yards , or 200 yards , or whatever , of a turkey before setting up is ridiculous and useless . Every situation is different , and you have to treat each one differently . Getting within even 300 yards may be impossible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to close the gap to 50 yards or less . " The difference between close enough to a turkey and too close is just one step , " says Brad Harris of Lohman Manufacturing Company in Missouri . " The closer you can get , the better your chances . But only as long as you 're not detected . " Getting close is important because it removes obstacles that might sabotage your hunt . If you 're 300 yards from a bird and there 's a ravine between you , you 're probably beaten from the start . Get closer , and put the ravine behind you . Let 's assume you 've made what you think is a good setup on a roosted turkey . Now , how much should you call to him ? Probably " not much . " Although most veteran hunters feel it 's important to call to a roosted gobbler before he leaves the tree , to let him know there 's a hen in the area , it 's easy to call too much . This can cause him to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overeager hen to show herself . Harris says that he likes to call sparingly to a roosted gobbler , but only until the gobbler answers . Then he usually shuts up until the bird flies down . Once the turkey is down from the tree , you can get more vocal . And this is where the different personalities and styles of turkey hunters get a lot of play . I know one hunter  --  a very good one  --  who does n't call as much in a season as most of us do in two hours . If Abner ever gets a gobbler to answer , he never calls to that bird again . He sits , gun at the ready , and waits . And waits . " If a turkey answers , he 'll eventually come looking for you , " Ab says . " All you have to do is be patient . " There 's bound to be some validity to this method : Abner has killed a lot of turkeys . But most of us do n't have that kind of patience . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game Calls in Mississippi . In his " Truth About Spring Turkey Hunting " video series , Primos jokingly says that he calls too much and calls too loud . But in Primos ' style of aggressive hunting , it works . " There was a time when I thought knowing the terrain was 70 to 80 percent of playing the game , " Primos says . " But as time went on and I got better at calling , things changed dramatically . Now , I think calling can be 70 to 80 percent of it , but only if you can call well . If you ca n't , then knowing the terrain is still the most important thing . " Somewhere between Ab and Wilbur lies the proper calling plan for most turkey hunting situations . The best way to find that proper plan is by paying attention to what the gobbler is telling you . Some birds want a lot of calling , and some are put off by it . There 's no way to tell at first what type of turkey you 've drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelps and clucks but not many of them . If that does n't work , you can always pick up the pace and get more aggressive , using cuts and cackles and all that fancy stuff . If you begin with aggressive calling , though , you 'll spook some timid or cautious gobblers you might otherwise have killed . Going back to our turkey hunt , let 's say the bird you 've set up on has flown down , and you 've engaged him in conversation , but that 's as far as things have progressed . For more than an hour , the gobbler has stood 150 yards away and has gobbled lustily , but wo n't come in . What now ? Think again about the obstacle factor . " If a bird seems interested in your calling but still wo n't come in , there 's probably an obstacle between you , " Salter says . " That 's when it 's time to try calling from a different position . Sometimes a hung-up gobbler will come in fast if you change calling locations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six to eight times on a gobbler , and he still wo n't budge . Other times , the third or fourth move will be the charm . You just never know . That 's where persistence comes in . It 's one of the most important attributes a turkey hunter can have , says Harris . But , he says , it can be a hard lesson to learn . " After you 've hunted a few seasons , you begin to see the importance of sticking with it , " Harris says . " You 'll begin to kill a gobbler every once in a while after a long , unproductive morning , or after three hours of working the same bird and thinking he 's never going to come . Do n't quit . It 's easy to give up when the turkeys stop gobbling at 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning , but it 's the wrong thing to do . " So you move on this hung-up gobbler , and he continues to gobble but still refuses to come . Your move again . Same story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup you 're on the same level on the ridge as the gobbler , about 200 yards away . At the first three calling positions , you were either above or below the bird 's level on the slope . It belatedly occurs to you that some of the advice you 've read about turkey hunting suggests setting up as close as possible to the gobbler 's level so that the bird does n't have to travel up or downhill . At the same time , you remember another tip : When a gobbler continues to refuse your offers , try a different call . Sometimes the new sound will be more to his liking . So you put the diaphragm mouth call back in its holder and dig out the slate call you 've practiced with but have never used in a hunting situation . At the first run of yelps , the gobbler interrupts your call . The same thing happens when you try again 30 seconds later , and this time the answering gobble is noticeably closer . " This damn bird is coming ! " you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun to your left knee and shift your body slightly to the right , so the gobbler is at a 45 deg angle off your left shoulder  --  the most desirable direction for a gobbler 's approach for a right-handed shooter . He gobbles again just as you 're thinking about making another call , and the sound is so close and fierce you nearly drop the corncob striker . Where is he ? He ought to be in sight by now . And suddenly there he is , in easy range at 25 yards , black as a buzzard in the early morning sun . The only problem is , he 's 90 deg off your gun barrel , almost past you to the right . He must have come along under the break of the ridge and popped up on top after he got a little past you . Do n't move . Do n't even breathe too deeply . The gobbler struts back and forth while you watch him out of the corner of your right eye . He gobbles explosively three times more , but your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster . Finally , just when you think you ca n't stand it anymore , he pirouettes away from you , hiding his white head behind the spread tail fan . It 's now or never . You swing the gun around  --  and get away with it ! The gobbler makes another half-turn , and the bead of your shotgun covers his head like an eclipse . Unless you do something stupid , the game is now over ; this gobbler is yours anytime you want him . Do n't let your guard down for a second , though , because even a point-blank gobbler can disappear like smoke if you give him half a chance . But at this point , you 're in the catbird seat . If you can stand to do it , hold off a little while on the trigger pull . Enjoy the show as long as you can . It 's the real reason you came here . STARTER KIT FOR TURKEY HUNTERS The equipment pictured here is a good starter kit with all of the essentials , plus a couple of items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I like raspy calls , but I 'll also carry a sweet , clear-sounding call or two . * Slate call : Be sure to include a striker and a piece of fine-grit sandpaper for roughing the slate surface as needed . * Loud , raspy , shuffling-box-style call : I use this primarily as a locator call because it 's bulky and requires a lot of hand movement , but an old-fashioned box is also extremely effective for calling gobblers all of the way to the gun . Remember to bring some extra chalk and also a carrying case so that the call does n't rattle when you move . * Shotgun : Mine is a Full-Choke 12-gauge pump chambered for three-inch shells . Camouflage the gun with a gun sock or camo tape . You may also wish to equip the gun with a padded sling . * Extra shotgun shells : It 's easy to overdo this . I carry two shells in addition to the three already in the gun . * Turkey hunting vest : Good vests have a game pouch big enough to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop-style seat cushion that can be pinned against your back when not needed . * Camouflage gloves and face mask , or camo paint . * Compass * Camouflage hat and hunter orange hat : The former is for hunting , the latter for safely moving through the woods . * Compact binoculars : These are more useful in open terrain , but they can also be used to good advantage in the woods . * Knife * Flashlight : This will help you find the way to your hunting area at first light or in case you get caught in the dark . * Bug repellent : An early hatch of mosquitoes or black flies can be miserable without this . * Owl hooter call : This is for hunters who do n't like to rely on their own vocal cords . The above items rarely leave me needing more . <p>
