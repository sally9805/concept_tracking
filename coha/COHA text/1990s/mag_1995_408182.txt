On a full-moon night last June , I sat on the jagged rocks of Mount Podbrdo in the highlands of western Herzegovina waiting for the Virgin Mary to appear . I was not alone . Tens of thousands of pilgrims prayed the rosary in assorted languages and stared up at the great white aluminum cross that rose from the rocky clearing like a flag of conquest . They had climbed through thorn bushes up the difficult slope from the village of Medjugorje to celebrate the thirteenth anniversary of the Virgin Mary 's nightly apparitions . Ivan Dragicevic , one of the six Croatian children who claimed td have first seen " Gospa " ( " the Virgin " in Croatian ) at this spot on June 24 , 1981 , and who is now a full-time professional visionary , led the crowd through the decades of the rosary . Candles flickered on the calcite stones piled against the cross and illuminated the faces of the believers  --  expectant , yearning , tear-stained . Paraffin and incense permeated the night air . Every crevice between the stones was filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags from every continent  --  and requests . One letter read , " Dear Mary , please bless my sick husband , John . " Another said , " I come to you on my hands and knees , a sinner , an alcoholic . Please , Mary , wash over me . Help me be clean . " Flames licked the letters . A woman in a MARY QUEEN OF PEACE T-shirt doused the fire with her Evian water . A trembling German woman pushed her handicapped daughter closer to the cross . Father Rookey , a healing priest from Chicago , laid his hands on a middle-aged man in a stretcher . A weeping Australian man in a wheelchair murmured , " Please , Mary , come to me . Please , Mary , show us a sign . " Like shadows bending through the blur of colorfully clad suppliants , Croatian women in black , many of whom I had seen walking barefoot  --  even crawling  --  from surrounding villages , wept quietly over their rosary beads , mourning the third anniversary of the civil war that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocence in which all involved  --  the foreign pilgrims and the local Croats  --  awaited redemption from the " mother of humankind . " But standing there above Medjugorje , a hub for warfare as much as for pilgrimage , I found the idea of innocence in this rocky " oasis of peace " difficult to reconcile with the bandit mentality and ethnic warfare that plagued these slopes and the valleys below . In May 1993 , it was not the aura of the Virgin that lit the night sky but rocket launchers targeting the Muslim section of Mostar , fifteen miles away , from a copse between Medjugorje 's main road and the Anna Maria hotel . And last night I had listened to the fight songs of drunken Croatian soldiers at the Anna Maria clashing with the evening mass that boomed from loudspeakers on the twin spires of St. James Church . To the Croats of western Herzegovina , the relationship between nationalist and religious fervor is not so much an irony as a casus belli . Croats refer to this forbidding swath of the arid Dinaric mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both the abundance of poisonous snakes and the Herzegovinian character . Wedged between the Riviera-style ports on the Adriatic and the verdant mountains of central Bosnia , the briar-snarled rock ranges of Herzegovina-the southernmost tip of Bosnia-Herzegovina-have served for the past five hundred years as a crossroads for successive armies : Turkish , Austro-Hungarian , Serbian , and Communist Yugoslavian . The region 's most primitive nationalists  --  including the worst Bosnian-Croat war criminals  --  hail from this rugged land . Ruined Ottoman fortresses still cling to the slopes , feeding the local memory of historical victimization , which is so acute that one Croatian soldier told me wistfully , " You should have seen what this country was like before the Turks . " To judge by the surrounding countryside , it seemed as if the Croats were trying to restore that pre-Muslim world . A few days before the anniversary of the Virgin 's appearance I drove with my landlord , Jozo Ostojic , to the Muslim village of Gradska , five minutes from Medjugorje . We passed charred , ransacked houses and a mosque , whose huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubble , I found a photograph of men in fezzes and black robes carrying a coffin , military draft notices from the 1980s , Arabic schoolbooks , and mildewed children 's clothes . The village , " cleansed " of its Muslims in early September 1993 , was now occupied by Croatian refugees from central Bosnia . " This area was once all Croatian , " Jozo explained , gesturing to a medieval Croatian castle high on a hill overlooking the parched sage , poppies , and Irish broom in the valley . " And now it will be again . Gospa wanted it that way . " I had come to Medjugorje to see how the legend of Gospa and the pilgrim parade fit into the politics of the war . From the beginning , the religious " happenings " in Medjugorje have been politicized . When the six children announced in June of 1981 that the Virgin Mary , bathed in light and floating on a cloud , had given them a message of peace and wanted the people to convert back to the ways of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing the church and blockading the mountain . It was one year after Tito 's death , and the regime smelled a revolt by Herzegovinian Croats . This fear was confirmed when children from a neighboring town came back from Mount Podbrdo singing the songs of the Ustashe  --  the Croatian fascists who are believed to have slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews , Gypsies , Communists , and Croatian dissenters during World War II . ( The Ustashe drew its most ardent supporters from Herzegovina , and a mass grave of Serbian victims lies behind the mountain . ) Before the year was out , the Franciscan parish priest , Jozo Zovko , was hauled into court on charges of " hostile propaganda " and sentenced to three years in jail . But the daily apparitions persisted , and the " miracle of Medjugorje " became a focal icon for the passions that would lead to the creation of the Croatian state in 1991 and the ensuing civil war . Even before full-scale war broke out in Bosnia in 1992 , the Herzegovinian Croats planned to separate western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the more developed Croatia . They tried to seize the multi-ethnic city of Mostar on the Neretva River as the capital of their self-proclaimed Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosna . Instead , they helped destroy it , and today the city remains divided between West ( Croatian ) and East ( Muslim ) . Now , as I looked at the rapt faces on the mountaintop , I recalled the message Father Svetozar Kraljevic , one of the local Franciscan priests , had delivered at a mass for English-speaking pilgrims : " The Croatian Catholics had no diplomats in the whole world . We were condemned to die . Suddenly Our Lady came and called you to become diplomats for the persecuted Catholics of this land . " Although the pilgrims may derive some romantic sense of Christian soldiering from such speeches , it seemed to me that they come to Medjugorje to revive their faith and repair their broken lives , not to serve the Croatian cause . Moments before the apparition was scheduled to occur , a public-address system echoed over the mountain : " Please kneel down facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The message was repeated in several languages as the flashbulbs of the rebellious drew hisses and shouts : " No photo , ni foto , ne fotografija . " Rosaries , pressed to lips and held out toward the cross , clicked and jingled . The moon rose over the thornbushes . A woman next to me pointed at the glow and cried , " Look ! " Heads turned , cameras flashed . More hisses . The crowd waited for a sign . Before the miracles  --  which have come to include visions of the sun spinning , spontaneous healings , and rosaries turning to gold  --  put Medjugorje on the holy-tours map , the village was basically Nowheresville , Yugoslavia , a hamlet of 250 families , many of whom lived without electricity or plumbing , growing grapes and tobacco and herding sheep . But even the Communists , unable to stop the pilgrims , quickly cottoned on to the idea of miracle-working when they saw the amount of money that could be made . Homes were expanded into pensions , hotels sprang up , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as $150 million a year , to say nothing of the fortunes donated to the church by pilgrims . Some 20 million people have visited Medjugorje since 1981 . Today , the town presents an allegorical tableau of the post-Communist era . On the grounds of the church , where soldiers and pilgrims share benches by the long outdoor row of multilingual confessional stalls , a ten-foot rendition of the Croatian national shield has been painted on the walkway . The red and white checkerboard emblem of Herzeg-Bosna  --  a variant of the Ustashe shield  --  dangles from the rearview mirror of every car , including the taxis cued up outside the church to carry pilgrims to the base of Mount Podbrdo for the equivalent of four dollars in virtually any currency . In either direction from the center of town , the road blazes like a suburban strip mall , flashing with the neon of religious indulgence shops , pensions , pizzerias , and duty-free shops . For pilgrims marching up or down the mountain , a main pit stop is the Devotions shop , a shack owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devotions something of a shrine unto itself , with outdoor speakers broadcasting messages like " Buddhism , yoga , and transcendental meditation will destroy you . They are the tools of Satan , " followed by inspirational Muzak . In case you do n't have your own vision on the mountain , Hoop has photographs of Medjugorje miracles and other supernatural phenomena from around the world posted on his walls : the visionary Vicka , a bolt of light piercing her heart and burning through the Bible in her hand ; a shrub on Mount Podbrdo swallowed in a halo of light , outlining the figure of a woman ; and the " Real Jesus " crucified , blood dripping down his body , atop an address in Modesto , California , from which you can order your own photo . And in case you 're confused about what exactly , if anything , happened to you on the holy mountain , Hoop also sells religious cassettes , books , and videos by Medjugorje converts recounting their experiences , including pop musician Michael O'Brien 's video " Sounds of Medjugorje : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out three years ago , Medjugorje 's commercial carnival was brought to a halt . But with the town 's excellent accommodations and easy access to Mostar and other battle zones , it was adopted as a garrison by Croatian soldiers and a host of international relief agencies . United Nations troops , the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , and the Red Cross set up regional headquarters here , to the chagrin of many townspeople . During last year 's muted anniversary celebration one citizen , apparently angered that UN aid was going to Muslims , pulled a gun on Jerrie Hulme , regional director of UNHCR , as he shopped near the church . The gun jammed and Hulme drove off . The locals also threatened his multi-ethnic Bosnian staff so doggedly that they moved out to the Adriatic coast . And last winter Croatian Defense Council ( HVO ) soldiers , busily " cleansing " the environs , issued a warning that houses sheltering Muslims in Medjugorje would be blown up . Herzeg-Bosna 's " holy city " also doubled as a crossroads party town . Young Croats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hang out at Medjugorje 's cafes and discos with HVO soldiers , who were pumped up after a day of ethnic " cleansing " in the Mostar region . As in all good garrison towns , Medjugorje 's black-market economy thrived , replacing the tourist bazaar with a wartime mall selling guns , drugs , and " duty-free " alcohol and tobacco , as well as stolen cars from Italy , Germany , and Switzerland . Cafe Colombo , just next to the church grounds , is now the most popular hangout for pilgrims , politicians , war criminals , soldiers , and aid workers . One evening , while pilgrims at a corner table were sharing their Medjugorje visions , a stony-eyed British mercenary sat telling his wounded war buddy , who had lost both of his legs on a land mine , that their brigade was on a list of war criminals . They seemed puzzled . The mercenary told me that he was here to help out the Croatian army . His " anti-terrorist " brigade , he said , does all the dirty work , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if it made any difference to him to be based in the " holy " town of Medjugorje , he told me he had no use for religion . " A man is either a good man or a bad man . " He paused . " Religion just makes wars . " Although last spring 's shaky Croatian-Muslim truce is holding , tensions in town remain high . When buses started unloading pilgrims for the anniversary , a very different brand of tour bus pulled into town , carrying Muslims fleeing central Bosnia . They had been sold one-way tickets by a scam tour operation , and , of course , the Croats would not admit them ; now they waited at the new Croatian consulate for visas they would probably never get . On the day I arrived several Muslims were beaten by locals while policemen watched , indifferent . Even Croatian refugees who fled Bosnian battlefields have found Medjugorje a tough sanctuary . A pair of Croatian girls from Sarajevo working in a " duty-free " shop , selling high-tech gadgetry as well as Virgin Mary ashtrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even traitors , because they had Serbian and Muslim friends in Sarajevo . " Money has changed everyone in this village , " one said . Such sentiments toward the Herzegovinians are typical in the rest of Yugoslavia . When the Medjugorje story first broke , the tabloid press in Belgrade had a field day . mocking the " scientists " who came to measure the earth and air for the presence of God and praising the Herzegovinians for masterminding such a hoax . Yugoslav urbanites have always perceived the place as bandit country , and the religious parade looked like the best hustle yet . Just as you 're not likely to encounter an atheist in a foxhole ( especially in Herzegovina ) , it 's hard to find a Medjugorjean who does n't profess belief in the miracles . After centuries of economic hardship and basement baptisms , the suddenly prosperous villagers could hardly doubt that Mary was their redeemer . When Croatian President Franjo Tudjman visited Medjugorje for peace talks in May 1993 , he did not hesitate to enlist Gospa in the cause of Bosnia-Herzegovina 's Croats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignited the " reawakening of the Croatian nation . " But Medjugorjeans themselves are not without humor about the product they are peddling . One former mayor has produced a line of T-shirts that lists the daily spiritual itinerary of the package pilgrimages . The T-shirts read like instructions for a board game , with items such as " 9:00 A.M. , go to visionary Vicka 's healing prayers ; 10:00 A.M. , English Mass ; 11:00 A .. , climb Apparition Hill ; 1:00 P.M. , get reborn at Father Jozo 's ; 5:00 P.M. , confess ; 6:00 P.M. , Rosary Mass ; 6:40 P.M. , visionary 's apparition ; 9:30 P.M. , Ivan 's evening prayer group , location to be announced ; 11:00 P.M. , share . " Two Yugoslav commissions of psychologists , bishops , scientists , and theologians assigned to investigate the Medjugorje phenomenon in the early 1980s concluded that there was no proof to any of the claims of supernatural goings-on . The Vatican does not rule on miracles until they cease . The bishop of Mostar called the visions a hoax perpetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionaries to a battery of examinations diagnosed them as sane . And indeed they do seem like an ordinary lot  --  who happen to have been blessed with extraordinary good fortune . Everyone knows where the visionaries live , and the locals are usually willing to walk a lost pilgrim to their doors . Ivanka Ivankovic Eliz and Mirjiana Dragicevic Soldo , both married with children , have visions about once a year . Jakov Colo still has daily apparitions but is shy and stays out of the limelight . Marija Pavlovic has married and moved with her apparitions to Italy ; on the twenty-fifth of each month she transmits Gospa 's messages to Medjugorje parish , which in turn faxes them around the world to " friends of Medjugorje . " These days only Ivan Dragievic and Vicka Ivankovic work the daily crowds in Medjugorje . Vicka , who lives in a new villa , returns each morning to her parents ' more modest home to conduct healing prayers from the veranda . When I stopped by I found the street outside jammed with taxis , pilgrims , and sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown and white robes , sat along a stone wall under a fig tree posted with war-death notices . Odors from the pigsty and chicken coop mingled with burning incense and pungent bougainvillea . A young woman was skinning a sheep next door . Vicka stood smiling beneath a canopy of grapevines while a nun translated her simple teachings to the crowd . " It would be very dear to Mary and Jesus if we 'd stop sinning . Our Lady also emphasizes how strong Satan is in the world . The best weapon against Satan is the holy rosary , so we should always carry with us our holy objects , anything that has been blessed . " Prayers began . The pilgrims bowed their heads and lined up two by two . Vicka closed her eyes and clasped the crowns of their heads . Many worshipers burst into tears . When the foreigners dispersed , leaving bundles of messages that Vicka promised to pass on to Gospa , the visionary ministered to the locals . A peasant woman tugged Vicka under the stone staircase and pulled up her shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer because of my daughter . She is a good student but she swears , and I do n't know what to do . Can you help me ? " Vicka hugged her . " I 'll speak to Mary tonight for you . " Whether or not Vicka is in daily contact with Gospa , there was something touching about the scene . Like the rest of her fellow visionaries , Vicka is no theologian , but she handles her ministerial role with a grace and compassion that succor her flock . By contrast , Ivan Dragievic , the other star attraction of Medjugorje , seems a weary and aloof performer . Ivan , who is married to a former Miss Massachusetts , holds his daily encounters with the Virgin at 6:40 P.M. as standing-room-only public gatherings in the choir loft of St. James Church . Sporting his trademark Hawaiian shirt and Air Nikes , he stands outside the choir loft door before these sessions like a nightclub bouncer , handpicking his audience from the jostling crowd . When he gave me the nod , I went up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knees , and there was Ivan  --  also kneeling  --  before a painting of the Virgin Mary . Nothing was said . After twenty minutes Ivan stood up and left . It was only when everyone began to leave that I realized the session was over . Wandering one morning through a corridor of souvenir shops , I saw a short , red-bearded man gazing up at Mount Podbrdo from under the wide brim of a sun hat . Beads of sweat dripped down his face and neck . With his wooden rosary around his throat , his pink skin and blue eyes , he could have been a turn-of-the-century missionary but for his jeans and Nikes . I approached him , curious to know what had inspired him to make a pilgrimage to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the midst of Europe 's bloodiest war in half a century . Dominick answered my question slowly and thoughtfully . An Irishman raised in Wales , Dominick said he had grown to dislike Great Britain and moved to Germany . One day in 1987 a friend told him about a place called Medjugorje where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are happy with your life , do n't go to Medjugorje , ' he said to me . " It will change your life forever . ' ' " " Well , " Dominick said , " I loved my job . I was a professional golfer with the Hamburg Golf Federation , making a lot of money . Anyone would have thought I was happy with my life . But I was n't . I had great troubles in my personal life . " He gazed at the ground and kicked a stone with his foot . " I spent my first days here asking Clod if he existed . Then when I got up to this mountain , I saw the blue cross , where Mary first appeared to those children . " As a frequent patron of Hamburg 's whorehouses and peep shows , Dominick had long been fascinated by the blue cross gazing down at him from one of the dockside buildings there . When he climbed Mount Podbrdo and saw " that same blue cross , " he knew God had brought him to Medjugorje . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . One day he climbed up to the peak of Krizevac Mountain next to Mount Podbrdo , where the stone cross spreads its wide arms over the village . But God was calling him to the smaller hill behind it . " So I clambered up there and sat down . " Okay , God , " I said . " I 'm here . What do you want from me ? ' Suddenly my mind was filled with the most impure thoughts you could imagine  --  sexual fantasies , scenes from my life . It was the work of Satan , the liar , trying to muddle me up , putting things in my head which he knows are my great weaknesses . " But on the way down , a bright inner light filled Dominick 's spirit . " I wanted to cry with happiness , " he said in his high , questioning voice , tears shimmering over his blue eyes . From that moment on , everything in Dominick 's life was an allegory of spiritual conversion . At the base of the hill a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on His word . On the road back to the village the only person in sight was a novice preparing to enter the monastery : God was urging Dominick to join a religious order . A baby 's cries echoed through the fields : Dominick heard his own rebirth . He returned to Hamburg , quit his job , gave his television and records to an orphanage , and prayed . He had many strange visions . The head of an African woman appeared to him in prayer . He could not interpret it . Weeks later he received a response from the Franciscan order to which he had written . Inside was a postcard of the same African woman 's head . Should he take this to mean he was to join the Franciscans , or go to Africa ? He decided to join the Franciscans . But inside the monastery he was still haunted by his sexual fantasies . " I 'm quite sick , you see , " he said . Dominick described depressions , neuroses , obsessions , attempted suicide . " I was locked up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite badly with knives and scissors . " He recently returned to Medjugorje with the same friend who had introduced him to the town , a British man who runs pilgrimage tours . " I 've spent these first few days saying , " Lord , I 'm here . You know my desperation , you know what 's going on . What will you say about it ? ' ' " He lifted his eyes and held them on mine , his brows rising into a question . With his thumb , he rubbed the sign of the cross on my forehead . " I wonder , " he said , " what your approaching me means . " Dominick seemed a little surprised by his own story  --  to hear it laid out , step by step , like a Canterbury tale . The narrative of conversion followed a formula that I heard from countless pilgrims during my stay in Medjugorje , but it had a twist : after the wages of sin , the confessions , and the surrender to faith , Dominick remained tormented . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two strands of the Medjugorje hustle  --  the package pilgrimage or the politics of the war . Our parting was awkward ; during our talk we had walked some distance and were now blocked by an international film crew shooting the Hollywood version of the Medjugorje story . The filmmakers , perched atop the roof of Souvenirs La Paloma , were shouting directions to scores of Bosnian Croat refugees lumbering up the mountain , working their rosaries , making their first pilgrimage as paid extras on a movie set . A wind machine blew dust into their faces , simulating the army helicopters of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that had menaced Medjugorje 's first devotees in 1981 . A dozen Croatian soldiers , who 'd been ordered to play Yugoslav army soldiers , sat looking miserable in their woolen uniforms with muzzled Rottweilers straining at their feet . In Gospa , the film , Morgan Fairchild plays a nun and Martin Sheen plays the hero , Father Jozo , the priest who has masterminded Medjugorje 's twin campaigns to redeem the Croatian people and to service the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jozo at his Franciscan parish in the hills of Siroki Brijeg , about a half hour 's drive from Medjugorje , he told me , " People come prostrating their lives , their crosses , their hearts , their vows , and their needs , and they meet here their mother . My duty is to make that meeting successful . " But when I heard him address thousands of Croatian pilgrims at an anniversary mass from the bandstand behind St. James Church , he transformed Gospa from a messenger of peace into a Croatian warrior . " Gospa , " he shouted , " protects the Croatian church ! Gospa is calling upon her people to pick up their swords , put on their uniforms , and stop the power of Satan ! " Ironically , Father Jozo had not at first believed that the children of Medjugorje were having visions of the Virgin . He was out of town when the first apparitions were reported , in June 1981 . " When I returned , " he said , " I thought , " That 's all I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately laid a trap . ' I thought it was a plot by the Communists to destroy the Catholic church and our credibility in this area . " Jozo was pressured to denounce the children as insane , and he was tempted to cooperate . But then , like Moses in the desert , he heard a voice : Go out and protect the children . " It was Gospa , " Jozo said . " I left the church , and the children ran toward me and cried , " Protect us ! The police are after us ! ' So I hid them . " Far from quashing the religious happenings in Medjugorje , Father Jozo 's subsequent arrest , torture , and imprisonment authenticated the " miracles " and breathed new life into the legacy of Franciscan martyrology , which goes back to the fifteenth century , when the Turks invaded Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Roman Catholic clergy fled . The " brown robes , " as they 're fondly called , suffered the same persecutions as their flock but sustained the small Croatian tribe throughout four hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late nineteenth century , the Franciscans remained the Church in the hearts and minds of the Herzegovinian Croats . The miracle of Gospa and Father Jozo 's suffering were quickly spun into one more thread in the mythic tapestry . " The regime was scared , " he told me . " Gospa 's movement started to shake the foundations of Communism . It was the beginning of the change of the world . " It was also Father Jozo 's stepping-stone to pastoral stardom . Thousands claim to have been " slain in the spirit "  --  a ritualized surrender , accompanied by fainting and rebirth  --  at the hands of the charismatic priest . At an initiation mass for some eight hundred English-speaking pilgrims at Siroki Brijeg , I watched him " transform " white plastic rosaries and little " miraculous medals " that looked like Cracker Jack prizes into blessed objects . While his staff passed out Technicolor postcards of Mary , inscribed with instructions for conversion on the back , he caressed the microphone and in a low seductive voice told the crowd to kiss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The audience wept . To Father Jozo , everyone appears as a potential messenger . When I left our meeting he told me , " It is the wish of the Blessed Mother to change your life and the lives of your readers . " He sent me off with a few verbal missives : Western culture had brought hate and war to his country ; the West is to blame for supporting the Serbian aggressors . " And now , " he said , " while the Serbs still occupy one third of Croatia , the West expects us to talk about peace ? " In the days leading up to the anniversary celebration , the biggest tourist event since the outbreak of war , I watched the townspeople preparing the sets for their Potemkin village . Refugees were kicked out of hotels to make way for pilgrims ; aid workers were told to pay more rent or suffer the same , and the police ordered them to remove their four-ton trucks from public view . " They said , " All those bullet holes and shell-shattered chassis present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " one driver told me . As buses from Poland , England , France , Italy , Germany , and the Zagreb airport unloaded hundreds by the hour , I saw a Red Cross bus carrying wounded civilians from Bosnia parked at the curb of the main street . Fields , cafes , and pension porches were colonized for " sharing sessions , " laying on of hands , speaking in tongues . Two circus-size tents behind the church , once occupied by refugees , were crammed with the sleeping bags , Coleman stoves , and crucifixes of low-budget pilgrims . Croatian and Herzeg-Bosna shields festooned the streets and fluttered over the crosses held by the peace pilgrims marching in from miles away . Men and women , clutching crosses and rosaries , crawled on their knees around the great white statue of Mary in front of the church . Near the outside confessional booths , I saw Dominick again , rocking from one leg to the other , walking the length of the church grounds , his head bowed . He looked up and his eyes brightened . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't doing so well but wanted to thank me for what I had done for him . I did n't understand . " I mean the talk we had the other night  --  or was it day ?  --  on Mount Podbrdo . " He looked away and winced . " I was going up Apparition Hill at that moment to take my life . " He paused . " But you saved me . God sent you to me as a sign . " He smiled , his eyes moistened , and again he made a cross with his thumb on my forehead . " God bless you , dear . I must go now for the sacraments . " I felt I had been in Medjugorje too long . Father Jozo regarded me as his agent , Dominick called me his savior , and in Medjugorje 's economy of allegory , this all seemed to make sense . For the pilgrims everything here was refracted through the lens of religious significance .

As I walked away from Dominick , Medjugorje 's evening performance began . The setting sun threw swaths of red and umber onto the thunderclouds gathering above the mountains behind the twin spires of St. James Church . The cypress trees swayed . Swallows ricocheted in and out of the open church doors while the mass played on , as it does from dawn to dusk . Like a cradle song , the sounds from the church mingled with the pilgrims ' voices and seemed to lull the town into abeyance . The crowd on the mountaintop that full-moon night waited for a sign . Gospa , the visionaries said , always appeared bathed in light . Twenty minutes of silence . A flicker of light against the night sky . Heads turned . Candles crackled on the stones . The blood drained from a girl 's hands as she clasped them in prayer , her eyes never moving from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . " Our lady came joyfully and thanked all of you for coming .

Older men and women struggled to get up off their knees , bruised by the rocks . " It 's kind of a letdown , " said one woman . " But : she knows we 're here . That 's all that matters . " Afterward , down at Cafe Colombo , a group of pilgrims wondered aloud at what had happened on Apparition Hill that evening . One sought reassurance from Gospa 's message " Blessed are those who believe and do not see . " Behind them , a tableful of HVO soldiers plotted their next campaign in northern Bosnia .

" In Medjugorje , the sacred and the profane have forged a surreal alliance . To its foreign visitors , the town offers the comforting fantasy of a nation built on a common faith . But nothing is simple here in Herzegovina , a place where religious belief has everything to do with primitive identity , political power , and territorial conquest and nothing at all to do with the pilgrim 's progress .
