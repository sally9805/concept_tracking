The drive-by charming caught Mary completely by surprise . Over the years she had grown used to machine-gun fire in the night , to squealing tires and sirens and flashing lights , but the sudden fey attack was something new . <p> She was sitting in her recliner in the living room , re-reading her tattered copy of Gone with the Wind , when she heard the soft tinkle of tiny bells in the distance . Fairy bells , hundreds of them growing nearer and louder until they drowned out the television that she kept on so she would n't have to hear every small-caliber altercation in the neighborhood . The bells passed Mary 's house like a carillon tumbling down a staircase , then suddenly stopped two doors down , at the Fraleys ' house . Of course the Fraleys did n't live there anymore  --  had n't for years , since the neighborhood had started to decline  --  but Mary still thought of it as theirs . <p> The bells were only a new twist in an-old-wound ; Mary had grown used to loud cars arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying for the few minutes it took to make a deal . She supposed it was only a matter of time before someone brought a souped-up , magic-powered vehicle by to pick up their fix . She got up to see what it looked like . <p> But this was no simple drug deal . In the silence , a high-pitched , piercing voice shouted , " This is for Boldershanks , ye dust-skimmin ' scum ! " Then came a sound like the hand of Oberon clawing the strings out of a harp , and a flash of light that drove Mary  --  just peeking out around the curtain  --  back against the wall . She blinked away afterimages of an improbably tall , slender figure with his hand outstretched toward the house , standing beside a gloaming chrome twelve-foot pumpkin on wheels , drawn by hundreds of mice . <p> Darkness and high-pitched laughter , then the bells began again  --  loud at first , then fading into the distance . <p> Mary had been sure her latest set of neighbors were up to no good , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be dealing pixie dust , the strongest hallucinogen ever discovered . Rumor had it the dust came from the dessicated bodies of actual pixies , but Mary did n't know if she believed that . All she knew was that the apparition outside looked like something straight out of the Brothers Grimm . <p> She risked another look . There , across the street and down , stood the result of the fairies ' work : Where before a tin-sided , double-wide trailer had besmirched the weedy lot now stood a two-story Victorian complete with gabled roof , shutters , and a front porch . The yard was groomed to perfection , its grass flatter than a golf green and sporting dozens of rose bushes in full bloom . A white picket fence surrounded the whole affair . It was hard to tell in the blue glow of the streetlight , but the house looked pink . <p> " Oh my , " Mary whispered , her breath nearly taken away by the beauty of it . She had n't seen such a wonderful house in decades , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share her enthusiasm . The front door banged open and all four of them rushed out , the three tuxedo-clad men cursing and waving their walking sticks at the departed fairymobile while the woman  --  the Slut , Mary had always called her  --  tugged off her full-length evening gown and flung it to the ground . For a moment she looked as if she were about to pull the slip off , too , but she settled for jumping up and down on the dress . <p> One of the men threw his stick down the street , where it bounced end over end and clattered to a stop against one of the burned-out cars near the corner . Mary wondered what they 'd been doing with sticks , then she realized that until a few moments ago those had no doubt been guns , and the tuxedos and dress had been her neighbors ' usual ripped T-shirts and baggy pants . <p> Come to think of it . . . . She reached into the middle shelf of the bookcase by the window and with the unerring accuracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear on her neighbors . They were hardly recognizable . The one with the scruffy beard now sported a well-trimmed Vandyke , and the woman 's stringy black hair had been permed . All four of them looked as if they 'd been recently bathed , probably for the first time in months , and by the fit of their clothes it looked like they 'd been shaped up , too . <p> They turned away from the street and the long-vanished fairies , speaking among themselves in words too indistinct to carry all the way to Mary 's ears . Then , to her horror , they began to attack the house and grounds , ripping out rose bushes , kicking over the fence , and pulling trim off the building . <p> " Of course , " Mary said , lowering her binoculars and turning away from the window . " They could n't be caught living in a pretty house . " <p> She understood why a few minutes later when a loud car , its stereo thumping and bumping even over the engine noise , pulled onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly roared away and vanished around the comer with a squeal of tires . The driver obviously did n't want to get involved with someone who 'd been marked by the fey . <p> The dust dealers renewed their efforts to destroy the evidence , but the fairies ' work proved tougher than the dealers . No matter how fast they worked , the uprooted roses would amble back to their beds , thee picket fence would right itself , and the house would grow back within minutes whatever they pulled loose . <p> When Mary looked out again in the early morning light , the house was still there , and still beautiful . And yes , it was pink ; the softest , rosiest shade of pink she had ever seen . <p> The police arrived not long after dawn . One of them spotted Mary peeking around her curtain and came to her door . He was a big , rough-shaven man who smelled of smoke and cologne , and he wore a crooked grin as he said , " Excuse me , Ma'am , I 'm Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but did you by any chance witness what happened here last night ? " <p> Mary considered saying she had n't , as she 'd said to the cops so many times before when the guns started up , but this one 's obvious amusement made her pause . <p> " It must 've been something , " the cop went on . " I 've seen dozens of these after the fact , but I 'd give anything to watch it happen . " <p> " Well , " Mary said , opening the screen door to let him inside , " there was n't really that much to see . It all happened in a flash . But the noise , now , that was a caution . " She sat Officer Connelly down on her couch and offered him tea , and after he 'd accepted a cup she sat in her recliner opposite him and described what she 'd heard . <p> " Boldershanks ? " he asked when she got to that part of her tale . He scribbled the name into his notebook with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pockets . <p> " That 's what it sounded like , " Mary said , " but I could be mistaken . " <p> " Oh , you heard it right . " The cop shook his head . " Boldershanks . Wow . Your neighbors are messing with big magic . It 's a wonder they 're still walking on two legs . " <p> " Oh . " Mary sipped her tea . " Is he a major player in fairy circles ? " The cop flexed his fingers in an absent-minded sort of way , and his pencil pirouetted neatly over each knuckle , back and forth . " No ma'am . He was just a small-time street charmer somebody shook down for his pixie dust . But his godmother , now , she 's not somebody you 'd want to mess with . " <p> " No , of course not , " Mary said . " Who might she be ? " <p> " You ever heard of Titania ? " Officer Connelly asked . <p> Mary had . Long after the officer left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  evidently not arrested for lack of evidence - tried in vain to erase Titania 's work . They were using shovels and spray paint now , but that had no more permanent effect than their earlier attempts . When the queen of the fairies charmed a place , it evidently stayed charmed . <p> Mary looked out at her own yard , slowly going to weeds since her back had started bothering her . Her house was falling apart , too , but her social security check barely paid the taxes , let alone upkeep . She looked back at the shiny new Victorian and wished the fairies would come do the same for her . <p> She said as much to Flora , her neighbor , when they met at the mailbox that afternoon . <p> " Oh no , dearie , " Flora said , resting her wrinkled hand on Mary 's . " You do n't want anything from the fey folk . Even when they mean good , their gifts always come at a price . " <p> So Mary had heard , but she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a perfectly good remodeling job to her enemies just to embarrass them in public , Mary did n't see any reason why she could n't do the same for a confidant who provided her with information on the other pixie-profiteers on her block . Mary had been watching her neighbors for years ; she knew everyone 's business . <p> Reaching the queen of the fairies turned out to be more difficult than she expected . Mary had n't supposed Titania would be listed in the phone book , but now that the wee folk had come out of hiding she had assumed someone in her acquaintance would know how to find one . But if anyone did , they were n't telling . Mary found herself snubbed by every one of her friends as soon as she mentioned fairies , and by the end of the day she was no closer than before . <p> She went to bed early , exhausted by her effort , and fell into a deep sleep . Suddenly she found herself standing in an open meadow , ankle deep in yellow and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which sat the queen of the fairies . Titania was a bit on the plump side , with silver hair that wound sinuously down to her waist , and dressed in nothing more than a bright blue scarf draped around her body . Beside her stood the unnaturally tall elf who had charmed the Fraleys ' house , and surrounding them all stood dozens of dwarfs and goblins and sprites of various sizes and hues . A few pixies hovered silently on diaphanous wings , their arms crossed over their bodies and their wide almond eyes focused unblinkingly on Mary . <p> " We hear you 've been looking for us , " Titania said lazily , inspecting her long red fingernails as she spoke . <p> " Um , yes , " Mary said . " I  --  " <p> " Most people do n't look forward to an encounter with the supernatural . " <p> Something in her voice sent a chill down Mary 's spine , but Mary forced herself to say , " I saw what you did to the dust dealers ' house on Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that block , and I 'll tell you their names in exchange for the same job on my house . " <p> Titania snickered , and her subjects echoed her like a laugh track on a TV sitcom . " We already know who they are , " the fairy queen said . " We supply them with their product . " <p> Mary gasped . " You what ? " <p> " We sell pixie dust to your dealers . Where else did you think it came from ? " <p> " I  --  I  --  " Mary stammered . " I thought  --  I 've heard it comes from dead pixies . " <p> Titania frowned , and her retinue shifted nervously . " It can , " she said . " We use more . . . benign ways of extracting it , but some people get greedy . " <p> " And you give them new houses for it ? " Mary asked incredulously . <p> " We deal with them thoroughly if they actually hurt someone , " Titania said , her voice ominously low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimming on the side , so we let them go with a warning . " <p> " Oh , " Mary said . " I  --  I did n't know . " <p> " Well , you do now , and you only get one warning yourself : Lay off our operatives or you 'll find yourself living in a shoe . " <p> Titania swept her arm out as if waving away a fly , and Mary felt herself tumble over backwards  --  to land with a thump in her bed . <p> She sat up , wondering if she had imagined the whole encounter , but when she switched on the lamp she found her bedspread covered with flowers . She picked up a couple of them , held them to her nose , and inhaled their sweet fragrance . Then , still clutching the flowers , she leaned slowly back against her pillow and schemed . <p> * * * The next morning she waited until she saw activity in the Fraleys ' house  --  it was nearly ten before the dust dealers got up  --  then walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . <p> The Slut answered it . She had ripped the sleeves off a ruffled blouse and tied the tails together below her bosom , exposing a generous stretch of shapely stomach and waist above a pair of black tuxedo pants ripped off just below the crotch . <p> " Yeah ? " she asked . <p> " I  --  I want to talk to you about buying your house , " Mary said . " Well , trading , actually . " <p> The Slut laughed , and a wad of chewing gum flew out of her mouth and hit Mary on the chest . Mary dabbed at it with her handkerchief while the Slut shouted into the house , " Hey Frank ! There 's another one wants to swap for the pixie palace . " <p> Frank stepped into the entryway behind the Slut . He had formerly been a paunchy , greasy slob of a man , but now his darkly handsome features could have graced the covers of romance books . Unfortunately , his manners had n't been improved along with his looks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've already traded with the crone up the street . " He pointed toward Flora 's sagging , dispirited cottage , right beside Mary 's own . <p> " What ? " Mary gasped . " You 've moving next to me ? You ca n't ! " <p> " Oh yes we can , " the Slut said . " By tonight we 'll be like peas in a pod . " She smiled sweetly as she slammed the door in Mary 's face . <p> Mary stormed back up the street and banged on Flora 's door . " How could you do this to me ? " she demanded . " We 've been neighbors for forty years ! " <p> " Listen , dearie , " Flora said through her screen door , " I may be old , but I 'm not senile . An opportunity like this does n't come along every day . " <p> " Opportunity ! " Mary said . " You told me you would n't accept anything from the fairies because there 's always a price . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a straight trade , a perfect chance to pick up a charmer without any strings attached . " Flora shook her finger at Mary . " Besides , you were going to do the same to me , were n't you ? " <p> Mary had no answer to that , save to turn around and walk stiffly back to her own house . <p> * * * The next two weeks were purest hell . The dust dealers played their stereo loud enough to drown out Mary 's TV even at its highest volume , and within days they had built up a new set of late-night customers who rattled her windows with their hopped-up cars . They came and went at all hours , save during the mornings , when the dealers slept in . Only then was the house quiet enough for Mary to relax , but after such long , nerve-wracking nights she could n't sleep even so . <p> She kept track of her new neighbors ' comings and goings , just as she did with everyone on the block , but it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw anything interesting . She had her binoculars out and focused on their car the moment they pulled up to the curb , and she saw one of the men clutching a mysterious bundle wrapped in a coat . The coat wiggled in his grasp when he got out of the car , and Mary did n't need to see the iridescent blue wing slip out through the neck hole to know what they 'd captured . They were going to render down another pixie for its dust . <p> She rushed for the door , no plan in mind except to rescue the poor creature , but she stopped with her hand on the knob . What could an old woman do against four healthy dust dealers ? <p> She considered running to Flora for help , but even if that two-faced witch were to cooperate , they would only be two old ladies against the four . The entire neighborhood 's honest population  --  Mary could only think of six  --  would n't be enough to do any good . <p> No , she needed help from another source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom , where she swallowed two sleeping pills and stuffed the cotton from the top of the jar into her ears . Then she opened the jar of fairy blossoms that she had collected off her bed and scattered the now-withered petals over the spread , then lay down in their midst . It seemed to take forever for the pills to take effect , but she finally felt herself drift away . <p> The Queen was not pleased when Mary appeared in the midst of her nocturnal frolic , but she was even less pleased at the news Mary bore . <p> " Goldenrod , Lightfoot , see to the rescue , " she commanded . Her long , skinny elf and a winged sprite of some sort both vanished in a shower of silvery glitter ; then Titania turned back to Mary . " I suppose you want some kind of reward . " <p> Mary tried not to wither under her intense gaze . " I  --  well , yes , I think that would only be fair , " she stammered . <p> " Something like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little bit bigger and nicer than the one your friend cheated you out of ? " <p> Mary swallowed . " That  --  would do fine , yes . Provided there is n't a catch , " she added quickly , remembering Flora 's admonition about asking for things from fairies . <p> Titania smiled , showing an abundance of teeth . " Oh , I would n't think of it , " she said . " The house will be perfect . " She swept her arm toward Mary , who once again tumbled backward , to land on a soft down coverlet in a canopy bed m the most adorable bedroom she 'd seen outside of a Better Homes and Gardens magazine . <p> She lay there for a moment , luxuriating in the wonder of dreams made real . Then , excitement burning away the effects of the sleeping pills , she got up to explore her new house . It was everything she 'd hoped for , from the attic all the way down to the basement . She spent hours peeking into every nook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the elegant carved trimmery and the cabinets full of fine china , and it was n't until dawn that she thought to go outside and check what it looked like from the street . <p> Titania had n't skimped . Mary 's house was bigger and more elaborate than Flora 's . Than either of Flora 's , since the elf had charmed the dust dealers ' new residence as well . <p> Of the dealers themselves there was no trace , save for some pig-like hoofprints crossing the flower bed next to the street . <p> While Mary stood admiring her new house , Flora came walking up the sidewalk , a sheepish expression on her face . " Nice remodeling job , " she said . " I like it . I like ' em both . " <p> " You going to move back ? " Mary asked . <p> Flora nodded . " As long as there 's no hard feelings . " <p> Mary laughed . " All 's well that ends well , I always say . " She threw her arms around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> So she helped Flora move her belongings back into the house next door , and they got together for lunch in Mary 's new dining room , then they had afternoon tea at Flora 's , and so on visiting back and forth for weeks on end . <p> Having three fancy houses suddenly sprout up on the block put a damper on the pixie dust business , so the evenings were considerably quieter than before , too . Some of the other residents along the street took a chance and renovated their houses the old-fashioned way , and pretty soon the entire neighborhood began to recover some of its former , natural charm . <p> And all the people there lived happily ever after , at least until the revised tax assessments arrived in the mail and everyone living on fixed incomes  --  Mary included  --  had to move away . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Jerry Oltion <p> Jerry Oltion is best known for his science fiction .
