You 'd think the people who collect checks over at the Republican Party would be having a terrific summer . After all , the money is coming in like bats to a barn at daybreak . In the first half of the year , the party hauled in $29.4 million in " soft money "  --  unlimited contributions that are used for getting out the vote , putting " issue " ads on the air and covering other big expenses . That 's about 45% more than the party raised in the same period four years ago . Is n't it time to pour the margaritas , toast the revving economy and give thanks to the party 's ultra-motivated electorate ? <P> Well , maybe not . For one thing , the Democrats are doing nearly as well . In six months , their party committees have raised $24.2 million  --  up 130% from four years earlier , a far greater jump than the G.O.P. has made . What 's worse , there 's the prospect of rain on the whole dollar-driven parade . The black cloud comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other campaign-finance reforms being promoted by some in the Republicans ' own camp , principally Senator John McCain and Representative Christopher Shays . These advocates of reform have long tried to shut the loophole through which as much as half a billion dollars in soft money could flow this year , most of it from Big Business and other special interests eager not to be forgotten when key legislation comes up for a vote . This fall they 'll try again , and their chances for success are improving . <P> What 's more , the campaign against soft money  --  which is given to the party rather than to specific candidates  --  is being aided by an unlikely new interest group , big donors . Corporate leaders are starting to balk at a system that many view as little more than a party-led protection racket . Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International , which gave more than $225,000 in the ' 98 election cycle , mostly to the G.O.P. , is likely to cease giving soft money this fall after a vote by its board of directors , predicts chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same . About 100 corporate and academic trustees of the business-funded Committee for Economic Development , a policy group that includes leaders from such companies as Mobil , Honeywell and Sara Lee , have signed on to a proposal to ban soft money and pass other reforms  --  and have sent a pointed letter to that effect to House Speaker Dennis Hastert . <P> " The pressure to give soft money can be quite intense , " says Kangas . " And the more a business is impacted by federal regulation , the more it feels it does n't have a choice . " While some donors give to candidates who support specific causes  --  Democrats who want a higher minimum wage , say , or Republicans who favor tort reform  --  many behave like AT &T.; The telecommunications giant has doled out $305,350 to the Democrats in the first six months of the year and an additional $527,050 to the Republicans , cozying up to both parties at a time when the company is battling over access to high-speed cable lines and other communications issues .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
