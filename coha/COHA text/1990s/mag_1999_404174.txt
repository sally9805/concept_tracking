Both were very slow , very painful and veil necessary . The first meant rising above the rampant rumors and gossip that came with the passing of her husband , rapper Christopher Wallace ( The-Notorious B.I.G. ) . The second meant modifying what was once a symbol of her undying love for the 6-foot-3 , 315-pound man who made a living rapping about girls and guns . The heart-shaped tattoo with the letters " B.I.G . " arched across the top was one of the last reminders of their life together  --  but also one of the last obstacles to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartshaped tattoo has been redesigned into a rose , and her life has blossomed . The 26-year-old singer with the seductive brown eyes and picture-perfect smile has emeged , not as " rap 's most famous widow , " but as a more complex , more mature , happier woman with a new attitude , a new baby , a new album and a new man .

My life is n't over . It 's still going on . It did n't stop when our relationship ended . Big will always be a part of my life . But I 'm still on this Earth , so I have to live my life for now and the future . " As she sits down for a rare interview in her New Jersey home , she admits that her strength has even surprised her . " I would have never thought I would have been able to get through such a situation , " she says . " There have been several different situations in my life in the past few years . I was able to get through all of those things and still have my sanity . I 'm fine . I 'm probably more stable-minded now than I was before . I just try to chill , be calm and not get stressed out . " But she says that the passing of Wallace , from whom she had separated before his death , has n't gotten any easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has yet to be solved , and people continue to misinterpret the relationship she had with the gangsta rapper . " He was a really cool guy , " she says . " He was funny . He was really smart , very intelligent , which attracted me . He was charming . He just had a certain way with words . His presence , maybe it was just the way he walked into the room . People seem to think he was mean , but he was n't at all . He was really nice . " She says prayer and the prayers of others helped her through her toughest periods . But even today , there are low points . " It seems like since then , I think a lot . I find myself just zoning out , " she says . " I try my best to deal with it , do things right , live right , be positive , and stay happy . That 's the mission I 'm on now . " Her mission has been made much easier since she met Todd Russaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she separated from Wallace , but before his death . Pregnant with Biggie 's child and living with rapper Missy Elliott in a Manhattan apartment at the time , Faith says , " Todd would call for Missy or come by the apartment to work on her album . Right after I had my baby , he sort of revealed that he was a little attracted to me . Our first date was actually supposed to be the weekend that Big died . Todd was really strong as a man for not being scared , for not wanting to be around me for the sake of everything else that came along with me-all of the attention , all of the issues , all of the situations . " Those issues and situations-from her rumored relationship with rapper Tupac Shakur to Biggie 's publicized forays with rapper Li'l Kim , and the subsequent deaths of Tupac and Biggie-have been well documented . Having completed recording work for such artists as Mary J. Blige and Al B. Sure ! , Evans created a stir throughout the rap music world when she married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a party . She says she loved him , and he said he loved her . But the naysayers panned the union , saying it was little more than a publicity stunt aimed at furthering their careers . In 1995 , as Biggie 's career was exploding , Evans was also making a name for herself as a singer , releasing her first album , Faith . But Wallace 's death left her future uncertain . It was during this time that her relationship with Todd Russaw grew . Until now , Faith has never talked about her new love , instead choosing to keep their relationship under raps . She says they both want it that way . " He is very into being family , being a unit and doing things together , " she says of Russaw , the father of her third child , 9month-old Joshua . " I admire that . I always wanted that . Growing up I always wanted a boyfriend and saw myself in the future with a husband like that . He 's really good with the kids . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has taught her about the music business , and about what it will take to elevate her " to a level I want to be at as an artist and a businesswoman . He has so many ideas . He 's very business-minded . " Being business-minded is a good attribute when dealing with Bad Boy , and its high-flying CEO , Sean ( Puffy ) Combs . " We have more of an understanding of each other now and more respect for each other , " she says of Puff Daddy , who signed her to Bad Boy after she sang for him in a studio one night . " It 's definitely more of a business relationship than a personal one . " Evans says that , contrary to rumors , she gets along fine with Puffy . " I 'm just into my own thing ; not that I oppose anybody else 's thing , but I do n't have time to hang out , whether it 's with him or anybody else , " she says . " It 's not like we dislike each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot or at shows , or whatever , so they kind of assume that we do n't like each other . " My business issues are just that-business-and I deal with them like they are business , " she continues . " I do n't really have any personal issues with him . He just happens to be the head of my record company . I think because he is an artist , people make more of it than what it really is . Puffy 's cool . I respect him totally . He does what he does well , and we make hit records , and that 's the most important part of it all . " Faith has come a long way since her humble beginnings in Newark , N.J. Growing up , she lived with her grandmother most of the time , spending many weekends with her mother , who was constantly on the road , singing backup for a rock band . She knows little about her father , other than he was a member of that band , that he 's White and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him , and she does n't rule out the possibility of meeting him one day . " I would be interested , but I 'm not going to go on a search or have somebody go find him . He would have shown himself by now if he was interested . Either way , I 'm fine . " Photograph Performing " I 'll Be Missing You , " a song she co-wrote with Sean ( Puffy ) Combs Photograph ( below ) in 1997 as a tribute to her late husband , Faith Evans ( left ) is surrounded by children who remember the fallen rapper . The song went to No. 1 , and won a Grammy Award . // A student of jazz and classical music , Evans was a high school honor student and allaround good kid . She starred in school musicals , and was even crowned Miss New Jersey Fashion Teen . She later attended Fordham University in New York City on an academic scholarship , dropping out after a year to pursue her singing career . Faith has been surrounded by music all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made grown folks cry on Sundays at Emmanuel Baptist Church with her stirring rendition of " Let the Sunshine In . " Since then , she 's wanted to be a singer , even proclaiming in her University High School yearbook : " Look for me at the Grammys . " She made good on that promise last year when she won the Best Rap Performance music award for " I 'll Be Missing You , " a song she co-wrote with Puffy . The success of that multiplatinum song helped re-establish her as a force in the music world . Critics described her voice as a mellow mix of jazz , gospel and RB , and compared it to the likes of Minnie Riperton and Chaka Khan . Now with her second album , Keep the Faith , she hopes to take her career to new heights . Two years in the making , the album , which was almost entirely written and produced by her , was tough to complete . " I was a little discouraged at first , " she says . " I never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of the project . I knew the album was going to come out . But my enthusiasm had kind of put the brakes on it a little bit . There were just so many things that were going on that were affecting my work and my thinking . " Encouraging words from fans got her through the difficult periods . Now the album , with the hit single , " Love Like This , " is enjoying remarkable success . It has sold more than 1 million copies , and has prompted Evans to go on the road this month to begin an 18-city theater tour with Dru Hill and Total . Although she will always consider herself a singer , she says she hopes one day to create her own label . " I am working with two artists now , " she says . " But I 'm taking my time . I want to get myself really established and do really well as an artist before I branch out and attempt to cultivate the other artists . " But the mother of three admits that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raising 6year-old daughter Chyna , from a previous relationship , and 2-year-old Christopher Jordan , named after his father Biggie , and infant Joshua consume much of her time . " This is what I do when I 'm at home , " she says as she comforts her son C.J. " I do n't have time to sit up and write songs all day . Maybe one day when my kids get older . " She calls motherhood a " hard job " and says it takes " a lot of patience , " but she considers it a blessing . " Certainly it is a blessing to have three beautiful kids who are all healthy , " she says . " God put them here for me to nurture and bring them up and try to keep as close to right as I can . So it 's a blessing . It 's a big responsibility , but at the same time it 's an honor .

" When he sees Big on TV or sees a picture of him , he says , That 's daddy ' ' - even though he has not developed to the point where he knows what " daddy " really is . " Meanwhile , Faith is moving forward with her life , hoping to instill into her children the notion that , in life , nothing is promised , and nothing is permanent . Her new rose-shaped tattoo that has been redone and now reads " Faye &; Todd " is her testament to that . " God blessed me to still be on this Earth . I do n't know how long I 'm going to be here , but I want to make the most out of it , " she says . " Everything happens for a reason , whether we know what it is or not . That 's what I believe .
