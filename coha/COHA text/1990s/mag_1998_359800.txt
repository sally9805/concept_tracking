NOT YOUR FATHER 'S HARLEY <P> It 's a bird ! It 's a plane ! No , it 's Suzuki 's Hayabusa ( Japanese for falcon ) , said to be the fastest " street-legal " sport bike ever made . Its 1,300-cc engine and aerodynamic design enable the bike to reach 186 m.p.h. , leaving the current champ , the Honda Blackbird , in the dust . What good is having a vehicle that can go three times the speed limit ? Ask any guy with a Ferrari . <P> KINDER , GENTLER SPORTS <P> Starfire soccer is a welcome change from the usual testosterone-charged kicking , punching , punting video sports games . Not surprisingly , it 's from Purple Moon , purveyor of CD-ROMS designed for 8-to-12-year-old girls . Starfire players spend a lot of time grappling with such emotionally charged issues as how to deal with ball hogs and feuding friends . Players eventually get to practice heading and dribbling . The one thing they do n't do is play much soccer . <P> PARISIANS ON THE FAST TRACK <P> Though 50 m.p.h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip for a subway train in Paris  --  or anywhere else . That 's how fast the new Meteor Metro will travel when it begins operation this week . Do n't look for a driver . These trains are robots , controlled from a command post under the City of Light . <P>  --  By M.M. Buechner
