A NATURAL MEDICINE CASE HISTORY WITH MASTER HERBALIST DONNY YANCE // Donald Yance , MHCN , is one of the most knowledgeable practicing herbalists in the country . Donny has researched and written about nutrition and herbal medicine for 20 years . He maintains a busy practice , writes articles , and lectures frequently to doctors and other health professionals . Donny uses life style , exercise , nutrition and herbs to support a wide range of conditions and promote optimal health . Donny does not prescribe , treat or diagnose illness . He works with doctors to let natural healing complement modern medicine . Robert : Donny , which case are we going to talk about in this issue ? Donny : A child with cancer . This is usually a heartbreaking story . But thankfully this case history has a happy ending . Robert : Donny , why do we have so much childhood cancer in this country ? Donny : We live in a toxic environment . Not just pollution but pesticides , vaccination , even toxic things like television . Vaccinations alter the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even vaccinating against chickenpox , as if it is anything more than a normal rite of passage for children-and a nice workout for their immune system . We are over-vaccinating the children . And the fake , nutrient-poor foods do n't help the immune system either . Lack of sunlight is a problem . Our life style is so synthetic . And the number one sickness in the country is a lack of love . We are also isolated from nature . Robert : Tell us about this young girl who came to see you . Donny : She was five and we 'll call her Melissa . She had a very serious form of brain cancer . She had a malignant brain tumor called neuroectodermae tumor in the hypothalamus section of the brain . The survival rate for this tumor is only one percent . I should point out that Melissa and her family came to see me with the hope of using diet , nutrients and herbs in conjunction with the standard medical treatment . I was not a replacement for the medical treatment , but to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So many issues . Getting back to Melissa , why did her family bring her to see you and decide to use natural medicine in conjunction with the standard medical treatment for this cancer ? Donny : They had had good results with natural medicine with other health problems and felt that at the very least , natural medicine could help cut down on the side effects of the very powerful drugs Melissa was on . She was on massive chemotherapy including cisplatin , vincristine , etopiside ( also known as VP-16 ) , and cytoxin . She had already undergone one treatment and was frail and nauseous and they wanted me to offset these side effects . Her immune system was also suppressed . She had bad blood mineral levels and was anemic . She had lost her appetite and was vomiting because she was so nauseous . Survival of the therapy is as important as survival of the cancer since this standard treatment is quite toxic to the body . Robert : And it only works one percent of the time for this cancer . Donny : Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive the treatment , if it is going to get rid of the cancer . Donny : That 's right . Robert : What did you do on her first visit ? Donny : When she came to see me for the first time she was very nauseous . Her tumor size was about two centimeters . She was doing all the medications that I listed above in preparation for a stem cell transplant . She was undergoing a lot of radiation as well . No one I have ever seen has done well with this protocol alone . But in combination with the natural medicine suggestions I gave her , Melissa did well indeed . Robert : Where did you start with her ? Donny : The first thing I did with her was aromatherapy . I put tangerine and lavender essential oil in a diffuser which is a small device that spreads the smell of these essential oils throughout the room . These essential oils so inhaled are a wonderful way to help with nausea . The citrus essence is so helpful that you can even lie in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away . Just inhaling the oil will make you feel so much better . Melissa instantly felt better after inhaling this aroma . This caused her to have a connection with me and trust and follow all the suggestions that were to come . It made her really believe in the natural therapies we would then continue to pursue . She was a real trouper . Robert : What did you do with her diet ? Donny : I recommended she use all organic foods and started her with a smoothie recipe : organic yogurt , medium chain triglyceride oil , flaxseed oil , fish oils , lowtemperature whey protein , chlorella , berries and fruits that she liked . I also put her on miso soup with Shiitake and Reishi mushrooms , organic beef bones to promote the health of her own bone marrow , along with kombu ( a seaweed ) and many vegetables . Robert : That sounds like one immuneboosting soup . Donny : I also put her on a supplement called Lacto Brev ( made by Source Naturals ) which helped her natural killer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune cells the body makes which are crucial for fighting cancer . The Lacto Brev helped her NK cells go up nicely . We also used a mushroom extract called PSK ( polysaccharide K ) , and we used a supplement of Maitake-D fraction in the dropper form . I put her on alpha lipoic acid , 100 mg per day and quercetin powder , one half teaspoon per day dissolved in applesauce , which works out to 1,000 mg per day of quercetin . It has wonderful anti-cancer properties and is actually synergistic with cytoxin , one of her chemotherapy drugs . I put her on another enzyme called SerraflazymeTM ( made by Ecological Formulas ) which has great anti-inflammatory effects . Enzymes help the cancer-cell killing ability of chemotherapy . I also put her on an overall antioxidant formula with vitamins C , E , carotenoids , green tea extract , grape seed and CoQ10 . I also gave her a children 's one daily multiple natural vitamin . Robert : That is quite an assignment for a child . But she followed your instructions well ? Donny : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on acidophilus and many herbs . Her herbal formula contained eleutherococcus , astragalus , echinacea , turmeric , schizandra and licorice . Robert : How much of that did she take each day ? Donny : One half teaspoon three times per day , which is a hefty dose for a five-yearold , but you must use these larger , therapeutic doses when you are dealing with cancer . I used red root , cat 's claw and baptisia in a later formula . Baptisia works very well with echinacea . The red root is great for a weak spleen . Robert : That sounds like a wonderful formula . Did you change the formula over time ? Donny : Yes , I changed much of her regimen regularly to deal with her changing needs . As she progressed through the chemotherapy and stem cell replacement , there were many complications and I minimized them nicely by changing the supplements and herbs to help her body where it needed assistance and support . Robert : Mouth sores are often a problem with this kind of radiation and chemotherapy . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of licorice called DGL ( Enzymatic Therapy ) whenever she had this problem and it helped it go away quickly . Robert : How long was she on this overall diet , supplement and herbal protocol ? Donny : Keep in mind that we adjusted it constantly , but she remained on it with variations for over a year . Robert : What did her doctor think of this approach of using natural medicine along with the orthodox treatment ? Donny : He gave his full approval to everything we did . Robert : That 's wonderful . Donny : She stayed relatively healthy throughout the stem cell transplant and was the prize patient at the hospital . Of all the children who were being treated , she did the best . Robert : So how is she doing now ? Donny : Extremely well . She had the stem cell replacement and is now as healthy as a child her age can be . Her weight is perfect , her health is radiant . Her doctors are amazed , and there has been much media interest in this case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional medicine worked well together . Donny : Yes . Robert : Donny , this is a wonderful case history . I really salute the work you are doing-groundbreaking integration of optimal nutrition , herbal medicine , aromatherapy and standard medicine . It may be 50 years or more before the general public has access to this kind of therapy . Donny : The natural component to this kind of treatment is the least expensive part , and virtually non-toxic . Robert : And so helpful . Donny : Yes . Robert : Life-saving , really . I know there are many people alive today because of your extraordinary work . Donny : It is just a pleasure to help people accomplish what they can when given the right nutrients , herbs and diet and when they are spiritually balanced as well . Removing the fear in cancer patients is also important for their healing . Robert : You bring a very strong spiritual component to your work . Perhaps we will have time to talk about that in depth at some point . Donny : It is such an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this and so many other things-spiritual and herbal-in your new book Herbal Medicine , Healing and Cancer which will be released in 1999 . We 'll make sure to let totalhealth readers know about it as soon as it is available . Donny : I am also in the process of starting a non-profit retreat center in Ashland , Oregon where these kinds of problems can be treated naturally . All kinds of practitioners will be there , along with me , to help guide cancer patients on the healing path . The center is not yet open but will be in 1999 . For more information , readers can contact the office in Connecticut : Wellsprings Center for Natural Healing , 24 East Avenue , Suite 1294 , New Canaan , Connecticut 06840 . Robert : Donny , thank you so much for another wonderful case history and for being such a fine healing force in so many lives . I look forward to our next case history here in totalhealth . Donny : So do I , Robert . My pleasure . Author Affiliation Interviewed by totalhealth Associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
