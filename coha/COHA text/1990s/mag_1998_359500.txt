The Federal Election Commission is probably the least-feared watchdog agency in Washington , which is why inside the Beltway its nickname is the " Failure to Enforce Commission . " That explains why the hottest guessing game in town is figuring out how this nearly toothless body managed to do what volumes of editorial screeds , congressional bombast and urgent pleas from top FBI and Justice officials could not  --  specifically , push Attorney General JANET RENO to the verge of naming a new independent counsel to investigate the financial maneuverings of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign . The explanation , says an insider , is that an FEC audit of the campaign , which landed at Justice about three weeks ago , concluded that White House and campaign officials may have intentionally attempted to evade federal election laws by manipulating " issue advocacy " ads funded by the national Democratic Party or state parties into hard-sell vote-for-Clinton-Gore messages . Why is this significant ? Because throughout the year , Reno has been able to ignore the entreaties of FBI Director LOUIS FREEH , Justice campaign task-force chief CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said , the case did not meet the independent-counsel law 's test that there be " specific and credible charges " about the President or some other high official . While the FEC audit contains " no smoking guns , no great revelations , " says a a lawyer familiar with the case , " the Justice Department bases its interpretation of the law on what the FEC says , and once they say something 's improper , bingo . It 's specific and credible . " The issues seem plain . " These ads were produced and designed by the campaign media consultants , " says Common Cause president ANN MCBRIDE , pointing out that " it 's on the public record that Clinton was very much involved in them . " Reno watchers believe she will soon launch a formal 90-day inquiry into the Democrats ' use of issue-advocacy ads to promote the ticket , and the betting inside Justice is that she will ultimately seek an independent counsel . If that happens , officials say , the mother of all IC probes could result , enveloping Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign also benefited from issue ads like the ones in question . " In the real world , " says a senior Administration hand , " it comes down to the whole ball of wax . No self-respecting independent counsel is going to stop at some artificial line .
