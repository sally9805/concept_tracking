From Chapter IV // First Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection // and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema . The night before I was so excited I // could n't sleep till dawn . I 'd still be sleeping if my grandmother had n't come banging at the door . // Get up ! Get up ! Get that child outa the bed . Happiest day of his life an ' him snorin ' above in the bed . // I ran to the kitchen . Take off that shirt , she said . I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water . My mother scrubbed me , my grandmother scrubbed me . I was raw , I was red . // They dried me . They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt , the short pants , the white stockings , the black patent leather shoes . Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood dripping from it , flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty-looking crown of thorns . // Come here till I comb your hair , said Grandma . Look at that mop , it wo n't lie down . You did n't get that hair from my side of the family . That 's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father . That 's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians . If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you would n't have this standing up , North of Ireland , Presbyterian hair . // She spat twice on my head . // Grandma , will you please stop spitting on my head . // If you have anything to say , shut up . A little spit wo n't kill you . Come on , we 'll be late for the Mass. // We ran to the church . My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms . We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . Then he placed on my tongue the wafer , the body and blood of Jesus . At last , at last . // It 's on my tongue . I draw it back . // It stuck . // I had God glued to the roof of my mouth . I could hear the master 's voice , Do n't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you 'll roast in hell for eternity . I tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me , Stop that clucking and get back to your seat . God was good . He melted and I swallowed Him and now , at last , I was a member of the True Church , an official sinner. // When the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church , my mother with Michael in her arms , my grandmother . They each hugged me to their bosoms . They each told me it was the happiest day of my life . They each cried all over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was a swamp . // Mam , can I go now and make The Collection ? // She said , After you have a little breakfast . // No , said Grandma.You 're not making no collection till you have a proper First // Communion breakfast at my house . Come on . // We followed her . She banged pots and rattled pans and complained that the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call . I ate the egg , I ate the sausage , and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away . // Go aisy with that sugar . Is it a millionaire you think I am ? An American ? Is it bedecked in glitterin ' jewelry you think I am ? Smothered in fancy // furs ? // The food churned in my stomach . I gagged . I ran to her backyard and threw it all up . Out she came . // Look at what he did . Thrun up his First Communion breakfast . Thrun up the body // and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What am I goin ' to do ? I 'll take // him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself . // She dragged me through the streets of Limerick . She told the neighbors and // passing strangers about God in her backyard . She pushed me into the confession // box . // In the name of the Father , the Son , the Holy Ghost . Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . It 's a day since my last confession . // A day ? And what sins have you committed in a day , my child ? // I overslept . I nearly missed my First Communion . My grandmother said I have standing up , North of Ireland , Presbyterian hair . I threw up my First Communion breakfast . Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do . // The priest is like the First Confession priest . He has the heavy breathing and // the choking sounds . // Ah ... ah ... tell your grandmother to wash God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Hail Mary and one Our Father . Say a prayer for me and God bless you , my child . // Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box . Grandma said , Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box ? If ' t is a thing I ever // find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I 'll tear the bloody kidneys outa // you . Now what did he say about God in my backyard ? // He said wash Him away with a little water , Grandma . // Holy water or ordinary water ? // He did n't say , Grandma . // Well , go back and ask him . // But , Grandma ... // She pushed me back into the confessional . // Bless me , Father , for I have sinned , it 's a minute since my last confession . // A minute ! Are you the boy that was just here ? // I am , Father . // What is it now ? // My grandma says , Holy water or ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be bothering me again . // I told her , Ordinary water , Grandma , and he said do n't be bothering him again . // Do n't be bothering him again . That bloody ignorant bogtrotter. // I asked Mam , Can I go now and make The Collection ? I want to see James Cagney. // Grandma said , You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because // you 're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground . Come on , go home . // Mam said , wait a minute . That 's my son . That 's my son on his First Communion day . He 's going to see James Cagney. // No he 's not . // Yes he is. // Grandma said , Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will save his // Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul . Go ahead . // She pulled her shawl around her and walked away . // Mam said , God , it 's getting very late for The Collection and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lyric Cinema and see if they 'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit . We met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street . He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying . Trying ? he said . You do n't have money ? I was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said , That 's all right . I 'll get you in . I 'll create a diversion . // What 's a diversion ? // I have the money to go and when I get in I 'll pretend to have the fit and // the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream . I 'll be watching the door and when I see you in I 'll have a miraculous recovery . That 's a diversion . That 's what I do to get my brothers in all the time . // Mam said , Oh , I do n't know about that , Mikey . Would n't that be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit a sin on his Communion day . // Mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he was n't a proper Catholic anyway so it did n't matter . He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man , Frank Goggin , was so worried over Mikey he never noticed . It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door , shocking his poor old Irish mother , and that was the end of my First Communion day . //
