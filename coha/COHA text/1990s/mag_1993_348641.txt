Rightsizing . Restructuring . Downsizing . The terms are cold and unemotional . Yet the euphemisms of the early 1990s all mean the same thing : layoffs . Over the past five years , corporate America has been driven by a single-minded mission to gut itself of " excess workers . " It was supposed to be the fastest and easiest way to cut business costs , be more competitive and raise profits  --  or at least that 's what many top executives thought . <P> But there is mounting evidence that this slash-and-burn labor policy is backfiring . Studies now show that a number of companies that trimmed their work forces not only failed to see a rebound in earnings but found their ability to compete eroded even further . " What 's happened should n't be called downsizing . It 's dumbsizing , " says Gerald Celente , director of the Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck , New York . " All these firings are going to end up hurting our international competitiveness , not helping it . " <P> Whatever it is called , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than 6 million permanent pink slips have been handed out since 1987 , and layoffs are occurring at an even faster pace this year than in 1992 . Despite signs of a brisker economy , at least 87 large firms announced major job cuts in the first two months of 1993 alone . <P> What is so troubling is that while companies do trim a bloated work force from time to time , many of the recent layoffs may not have been necessary . According to a new study by Wayne Cascio , a business professor at the University of Colorado , companies have too often assumed that if the competition was cutting costs by firing workers , then they had to follow suit . Compaq Computer , for example , announced last October that it was laying off 1,000 workers . Yet two weeks later , the company admitted that profits would double in 1992 . Firms like General Electric and Campbell Soup continued to slash personnel even though they both just had highly profitable years . " There is tremendous peer pressure to get rid of workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everybody 's doing it because they think they have to . " <P> But the deeper problem facing some companies was an inability to respond adroitly to changing markets , and decimating their work forces may have made that task even tougher when the recovery finally rolled around . " Just look at what they 've done to IBM and Sears , " says Celente . " They 've cut the heart out of these companies . They are blaming an overstaffed work force for bringing down profits . But that 's not the real problem . These companies lost out competitively because they did n't change their products . " <P> One of the most obvious effects of downsizing is that the employees who survive are forced to work longer and harder . In February the manufacturing workweek stretched to 41.5 hours , the longest in 27 years . The resulting increase in stress leads to discontent , lowers creativity and undermines corporate loyalty . A study by the American Management Association last year showed that of more than 500 firms surveyed that had cut jobs since 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , two-thirds of the companies showed no increase in efficiency at all and less than half saw any improvement in profits .
