In the days of his youth , Aldo often found himself  --  as many of us did  --  in a state of grace , and the sensation in his boundless filling heart resembled , to his mind , the transports of love . His Midwestern college , set down in the middle of a cornfield and isolated from any big city by fifty miles of empty , cold-roughened highway , seemed a basin of happiness in which he had been permitted , by some heavenly dispensation , to swim . Elms , dead elsewhere , had somehow survived in this town , pointing their great forked limbs at the sky . The quarry south of campus , hidden in its fringe of college-owned forest , echoed with the autumn shouts of naked swimmers ; and in the frigid winters , skaters hiked the long way through the trees and picked their way carefully down to the ice . The rural sky was a comforting black infested with stars , and though he bruised himself when he skated , the cold Ohio air acted as a sort of balm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , in the heat of the town 's one diner , he could examine his empurpled knees , not without some pride . <p> Small towns were new to him . The daily goodness of the Ben Franklin on College Street , offering its yarn and Bic lighters and artificial plants to whomever happened to walk through the swinging glass doors , swelled his soul . The tiny bank employed two tellers , both named Marie . The movie theater with its red velvet seats ran only the most second-rate films , and the screen was stained near the upper-left-hand corner ; but this became visible only in outdoor scenes , when the stain resembled a small rain cloud . Despite the bad acting and ridiculous , juvenile plots , Aldo usually left the theater in a haze of goodwill , while around him the town disappeared into darkness down its two main streets , streets which carried their heavy freight of brick and ironwork as they had for a hundred and sixty years . He loved the town and the college , both lit with a stage-set perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often tired and fretted over his schoolwork , and his romances were only middlingly satisfying . He was poor , and had grown chubby on dormitory food . But even when he least expected it , he would be visited with a new gust of this unnamable generosity of spirit , when the world seemed nearly Platonic in its perfection . At these times he loved the world with such a passion that he worried he would one day lose his way to this grace , that its sources were more mysterious than the town around him : the pharmacy , its Valentine hearts illuminated in the window display ; the dense tarry air in the Army-Navy store . The sensation that he was one among many  --  and yet still one , an individual being set loose on the planet  --  and that so much beauty abounded , on all sides , in every form , for him to encounter  --  all this combined to lift his heart above the ordinary , and made him , when it came , inexpressibly joyful . He was not religious , but such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright curtain of the world-some great moral idea , some brilliant distillation of planetary consciousness that ringed the earth like a second atmosphere  --  something . It had come on him slowly in his three years here , this feeling , but now he sensed it defined him , and if he lost it , he feared , it would be like dying . Superstitiously he avoided thinking of it , as much as he could . Grace examined was  --  he suspected  --  grace denied . <p> His apartment off-campus Aldo shared with two relative strangers : a woman pianist named Eleanor , who used her long fingers as leverage to open difficult jars ; and Bram , a dull , thick-chested economics major . Eleanor the pianist was taller than he , with a great pianist 's wingspan , and irritatingly left behind in the shower 's drain trap her short brown hairs . Though pretty she was a poor housekeeper , and her dirtied knives and half-eaten lunches lingered on the brown Formica counters for days . Beneath the window of her long bedroom she kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones , she tamped its keys with great passion . Bram , who had an almost perfectly cylindrical head  --  except for his jutting nose , it looked as though it had been painstakingly lathed  --  strenuously lifted barbells in his small room beneath the eaves , filling the hallway with a sweaty stink . Strutting to the shower after these sessions , he wore bikini underwear , his blunt uncircumcised penis visible in outline beneath the fabric . A girlfriend could be heard in his room late at night , though she never stayed till morning . As for Aldo he had his metal shelves and rickety desk , his Greek and Latin dictionaries  --  he was a classics major  --  and his shoeboxes full of vocabulary flashcards . In the mirror he was a plumpish , curly-headed version of his father , shorter by three inches and with his mother 's large sorrowful Italian eyes fastened , somewhat incongruously , above his father 's looming , cavernous nose . While not vain exactly , he liked his own looks , and was bothered only by the troublesome way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primitive appearance . He had slept with four girls  --  women  --  since his freshman year , when he had lost his virginity to a slim and fragile-feeling poetess who had since dropped out of school and gone home to Columbus . Such were the facts of Aldo Gorman 's life at twenty : sexually adequate , though unremarkable ; interesting-looking , and handsome in the manner of most youths ; periodically filled with an inexplicable grace which , when it faded under some daily pressure , he feared would never come again ; and , not unimportantly , devoted to two dead languages , great sloppy tubs of vocabulary and syntax he hefted alternately  --  Greek four times a week , Latin five . And also , that winter , there was a girl he loved who did not love him back . Her name was Miranda Lowe . <p> She sat beside him one day in his glaciology class  --  a gut , to complete his science requirements  --  and she had forgotten to bring her book ; would he mind if she looked on at his ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You 'd think , with all this snow , " she said , almost whispering , " we would n't need a class on glaciers . " <p> " You 'd think , " he agreed . " I felt like Amundsen this morning . " <p> She smiled . " I know what you mean . " <p> " Without the dogs . " <p> " I do n't think he used dogs , " she said . " I think he used ponies . " <p> " Oh , " he said . " Really ? Ponies ? " <p> " One of them did . " <p> " Actual ponies ? " <p> " I think so , " she said , glancing at him shyly , " and then I think they ate them . " <p> " Oh , " he said again . In the cold classroom full of melting boots and wet wool , she wore only a thin-looking white cotton sweater imprinted with black dots , as though her own heat were enough to keep her warm . Brown hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose : in many ways she was a conventional sort of beauty , but what seemed to be shyness  --  she would n't meet his eyes  --  distinguished her from any of a hundred beautiful girls , as did , seen this close , the ghostly blond mustache on her upper lip , which he imagined another girl might have eradicated in some way . She seemed , like him , mostly innocent , and it was this that twanged at his heart , producing not love but its disreputable cousin , desire . " Okay ? " he asked , before turning the page . " Mm-hm , " she answered . A tiny feather , released from his puffy down jacket , lifted into the air between them . <p> But she would not have him . She was from New Mexico , and was already engaged  --  unusual in their generation , but she had the ring to prove it . In the library she held it out , where , under the fluorescent lights , it seemed a pale , fragile thing . " Two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was n't exactly a surprise . " You see him much ? " <p> " At breaks . " <p> " What 's his name ? " <p> " Oh ... I 'll tell you , but you ca n't laugh . " <p> " All right . " <p> " It 's Elmer . But he 's not what you think ! " A flush of embarrassment colored her cheeks , and the sight weakened Aldo 's heart . " He 's very tall , and he does n't hunt rabbits . And he talks like a normal person . " <p> " He in school ? " <p> " He 's doing his residency now . " <p> " He 's a doctor ? " <p> " Yes . " She hesitated . " Or  --  almost . He 's got a year still . " <p> " And he 's back in New Mexico ? " <p> " No , " she said . " He 's at Harvard . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " He 's going back to New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She touched his arm , laughing . " He 's not at all snobby . " <p> " I did n't say anything . " <p> " The way you said ' Oh . ' It was suspicious . " <p> " Elmer . " <p> " Yes : Elmer Grand , " Miranda said . And she pronounced the name with such firmness and resolution that Aldo understood at once he had no chance at her . The name as she spoke it seemed a brand of fine paint , or an excellent , old-fashioned toothpaste  --  something common , decent , thoroughly goodhearted . Like the glue , he thought . <p> A junior , Aldo was the only student studying Herodotus that year , under the direction of Larry Feingold  --  a short , skinny man in his seventies whose two front teeth rested endearingly on his lower lip , like a rabbit 's . He seemed happy among his decades of books , with the radiator ticking cozily under the snowy window , and despite his age Feingold had a round , childish head and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his worn chair , with his tiny brown shoes propped nimbly on the desktop , he looked more like a boy than anything . When Aldo stumbled , Feingold corrected him with a high cackling giggle  --  it was meant to be encouraging  --  and then , with a flourish that seemed showy from so small a man , he would lean forward and take over , speaking first one language and then the other , as though playing tennis with a second , equally agile version of himself . <p> <p> By January they were skipping around in Book Two and had reached the material on Egypt . " When an Egyptian committed a crime , " Feingold said , " adikema , it was not the custom of Sabacos to punish him with death , thanatou , but instead of the death penalty he compelled the offender , see that ? Compelled , in the aorist "  --  he rolled his eyes with the pleasure of it  --  " to raise the level of the soil in the neighborhood , geitoniai , dative of location , of his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , native town , let 's say , for simplicity . " <p> " Raise the soil ? " <p> " Yes , " said Feingold . " Hm . I think , in other words , to build a levee . Against the Nile . " <p> This seemed plausible . But down the page , an entire town had somehow been lifted high above the river , houses and all . Had the buildings been somehow propped on jacks , and soil shoveled beneath them ? Or were they collapsible structures that one could take down and put up at will , like tents ? And where did the extra soil come from ? " No , " said Feingold , puzzling , " it 's just a levee . See ? In the neighborhood of his native town . " He chewed with his rabbity teeth on his lower lip . " But , hmm . The temple stands in the center of the city , tou polou , and , since the level of the buildings everywhere else has been raised , anaskanomai , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all around . Now that seems to say ... " <p> " But the temple 's on the river . " <p> " Oh , that must be it . So , the temple is down there , on an island essentially in the middle of the river . The town is up here on the riverbanks . They look down on the temple . " <p> " But they did raise the buildings , he says . " <p> " Yes ... well , fanciful , maybe . It 's hearsay , at least . He gets it from the priests , after all . Or maybe he does n't mean buildings really . " Feingold read on . " Oh , but look at this , here . The road is lined , grammatos , yes , lined on both sides with immense trees , so tall that they seem to touch the sky . " <p> " So ... ? " <p> " Oh , nothing , " said Feingold . " Just those trees . Ancient ancient trees that were there once , on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet there they stand . God bless the man for that . " <p> Grace was to be found in the library as well , in the long free weekend mornings , when the sun was out over the snowy fields . From the top-floor windows the little town could be seen huddled under a Saturday morning 's icy calm  --  Aldo might be in the library as early as eight  --  while light , the cleanest , brightest illumination he had ever seen , poured down from the tiny , wintry sun and , after caroming off the snowy lawns , went flooding back into the empty sky , to fill it more with light . The world , though cold , was illuminated as though by the gods , in a way that seemed somehow removed from time ; and the leathery odor of the hundreds of thousands of books  --  among them his own Greek lexicon , the paper soft with wear  --  gave even this modern concrete building a gratifying , antique atmosphere , as though he had sat here for a hundred years , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light consumed him . <p> But he could not forget Miranda Lowe , and she seemed unable , for her part , to leave him alone . Without meaning to , he had become something of a companion to her . They studied together . She was an English major , and he watched as she beat her way faithfully through Pamela , the book 's polished black cover becoming creased and scuffed and its spine acquiring a series of white cracks . She used the book , writing in it heedlessly , while he , beside her , filled notebooks with long columns of writing , leaving his texts clean , unblemished , as though they had never been read at all . Necrophilic , he supposed . Orderly , at any rate . This contrast between them pleased him , though he could n't say why , exactly . He enjoyed her teasing , maybe . Pacing restlessly the night before an exam she read the dictionary , folding back page after page . " Megrims , " she said . And then after a pause , " Mephitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to watch her move around in the world . She had long graceful arms , and though her legs were unremarkable , her feet , when she slid her shoes onto the checkered carpet , were shapely and even-toed . Small , compact breasts . He was not alone in thinking her beautiful . She had dozens and dozens of friends , far more than Aldo , and many of them were admiring men who , after talking with Miranda , would look him over querulously . He permitted himself to feel some pride at such times , though he knew she considered him a sort of eunuch , not to be feared . This was wounding ; but there she was , sitting with him , while the other men had to drift away into the stacks . She did talk endlessly about Elmer , which grew tiring ; but to her credit she knew it . " I do n't want to , " she said , " but he 's all I think about sometimes . " <p> " It 's understandable . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think maybe I would . " <p> " Maybe . Listen to you . He 's such a good guy . " <p> " If he 's so good , what 's he doing away from you ? " <p> " Oh , stop , he is good . He 's always talking about helping people . Which is , you know  --  it 's good . But he can actually do it , and it 's what he wants . " She touched his books . " Unlike the rest of us . Like me . I 'm so not good it 's not even funny . " <p> He did n't know what to say to this . " You could teach . " <p> " But I do n't like kids . I do n't know what I 'll do , I 'm so selfish . He 's just so good , just categorically good . At least in that particular way . " <p> " Good is good . " <p> " But the thing is , he 's too good sometimes . In that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially ... " <p> He waited . " Well , badness is good , too , now and then . " <p> " For a change , " she said . <p> " Exactly . " <p> " Mostly he is good , " she insisted , " and he ca n't help it . So do n't make fun of him . " <p> " I 'm not . " <p> " Yes , you are . You always do . It 's because of his silly name . " <p> " Like I 'm one to talk . " <p> " I like your name . It 's exotic . Not like Elmer . " <p> " Forget his name for once . " <p> " But I ca n't ! " she cried . " Elmer Grand ! " <p> Neither had a car , but when a friend of hers drove to Cleveland after Valentine 's Day , Aldo came along , squished in the back seat beside Miranda , their arms mashed together and their legs touching from the hip down . For comfort 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . They could almost have been a couple . And her beauty , despite his familiarity with it , had not faded . In fact , under the red neon of the Flats bars , he could hardly look at her . But she talked constantly of Elmer , and her frail ring darted in and out of the light . She irritated him . And he wondered what he was doing here , in the racket of the bar  --  what he hoped for . Nothing , plainly , would come of any of this . It was foolish to think otherwise . She got up to dance , and Aldo , unable to watch , stayed at the table . <p> But she sat happily beside him on the way back , smelling of cigarettes . " I forgot to tell you , " she whispered , her mouth close to his ear , " Elmer 's coming to visit . " <p> " Good , " he said . " Have a good time . " Outside , the flat , frozen landscape sped past in darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a beery , hopeless sort of stink . Drunk , he began to feel a little sick . Jacqueline , on the other side of Miranda , slept , her skull rolling against the window . <p> " I want you to meet him . You 've got a lot in common . " <p> At least one thing , he thought . " I 'll look forward to it . " <p> " You 'd like him . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " You sound reluctant . " <p> " Let me know when he 's coming . " <p> " Why ? So you can get sick , I guess . " <p> " No , so I can leave town . " Daringly he added , " And take you with me . " <p> In the darkness she said , " Very funny . " <p> " I mean it . " <p> " If you really meant it , " she said , " you would n't be sitting here . " <p> " I would n't ? " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 've always figured that was impossible . " <p> " I know you have . " She put a hand on his leg . " That 's what I like about you . " <p> " No , what you like , " he said , " is that I hang around and adore you , and do n't make things awkward by making passes at you , which you would be duty-bound to deflect . " <p> " Oh , duty , " she said . Spitefully she removed her hand from his thigh . " ' New occasions teach new duties . ' " <p> " You can keep that there . " <p> She turned to look at him , her face dark in the darkened car . Her lips were close to his . " I thought I was duty-bound . " <p> " You 've always thought so until now . " <p> " How do you know what I 've thought ? " <p> " I know what you tell me , " he said . <p> " Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She leaned and kissed him carefully , just once , and sat back again , hand on his leg . Then she took her hand back . No one had noticed . The car motored on dumbly into the night . <p> " I  --  " he began . <p> " No , I 'm sorry . I wo n't do that again , " she said , her face turned away . <p> He leaned to kiss her , but caught only the side of her cheek . <p> " Please do n't , " she said . " Please . " <p> He tried again . <p> " Please , Aldo . I 'm sorry . " <p> Touching from hip to calf , they rode the rest of the way home in silence . Drunk , he thought . But still , this was unfair . When he climbed alone from the car , the first to get out , he called his goodnights to everyone , but Miranda said nothing : she merely slid over away from Jacqueline , glanced up at him with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After this , she stopped returning his calls . When he encountered her by chance in the library , she seemed always to be idling  --  killing time . She was still as lovely as ever , but she appeared , to his eyes , preoccupied , as though she had been caught in the dragging middle of one of her gigantic novels . He felt he had missed some opportunity  --  that had he been more forceful earlier , been more daring , he might have won her , and he regretted his weeks of inaction . But he had only been behaving decently , he told himself , and no one could blame him for that . On the other hand , had n't he been waiting , vulture-like , for the engagement to be miraculously broken off , so he could snatch Miranda before she touched the earth ? And how could that be considered decent behavior ? In fact , was n't he both timid and sleazy  --  and who would ever bother over a man like that ? <p> By the middle of April the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elms , so long dormant , had begun again to bud , acquiring a faint green haze . Elmer Grand had come and gone sometime in March , or so Aldo heard : he had fallen that quickly from her circle . He continued to avoid Eleanor and Bram , and in the meantime Cambyses invaded Egypt from Persia , crossing the Arabian desert to engage Psammenitus at the mouth of the Nile . Years after the battle had been fought , Herodotus walked the battlefield , the dry bones of the fallen still divided , as the bodies had been , into Persian and Egyptian camps . " Yes , " said Feingold , " the skulls , exactly , of the Persians , are so thin that the merest touch , epaphes , with a pebble will pierce them , but the skulls of the Egyptians are so tough ... " <p> " ... that it is hardly possible ... " <p> Feingold put a narrow hand on the back of his head . " Wait , " he said . A look of concern crossed his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly possible , " Aldo continued , " to break them with a blow from a stone . " <p> " Yes , " said Feingold , puzzled . <p> " Right ? " <p> " Oh  --  yes , " he said again . " Do you know what I was thinking ? How much I would like a drink just now . " <p> " Now ? " <p> " And I do n't drink , " said Feingold . " I have n't for years . I quit twenty years ago , and since then I 've been clean . And now suddenly I need a gin and tonic . Out of the blue . " He laid his text gently on his desk . " I was a terrible drunk , you know . " <p> " No . " <p> " Oh , I was . Terrible . I stopped because I nearly killed myself . My liver was calcifying , or whatever it is that happens to livers . Lithifying . And I was just careening all over the county . " A look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never thought I 'd get to be this old . I 'm seventy-one . " He narrowed his expression . " You 're a calm boy . " <p> " Calm , " said Aldo . " I guess so . " <p> " No , that 's good . I do n't mean to put you on the spot . I was n't calm , is what I mean . " <p> " But here you are . " <p> Feingold nodded , once . " Yes , here I am . And almost dead , anyway . " <p> " No getting around it . " <p> " No . A cruel thought , but true . Are you a Jew ? " <p> " Me ? No , " said Aldo . " I 'm not . " <p> " No ? I thought you and I ... " Feingold in his sky-blue jacket shrugged . " A Christian ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Nothing at all ? " <p> " I guess not , " said Aldo . <p> " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " But maybe a little bit ? " <p> " I would like to , " he said , " but it seems a little delusional . " <p> " Awfully attractive , though , is n't it ? Imagine . " <p> Aldo hesitated . " I believe in grace . " <p> " Oh : grace . Are you Catholic ? " <p> " No , just "  --  it was inexpressible  --  " happiness . " <p> " Oh . Well , good . Happiness is good . " <p> " But not only happiness ... grace , " he said , ferociously . But worryingly he had not felt it in weeks , and it felt like bad luck mentioning it out loud . " It 's the only word . When you know your place in the world . " <p> " Yes ; I remember the feeling . " <p> " The beauty , " said Aldo . " Something about all ... " He gestured . But it was eluding him . " Everything being where it is , in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are perfect . " <p> " That which is immortal in us . " <p> " Well  --  " <p> " That 's grace . And then you get to sin : the sullying of that goodness . But to begin with , starting out , now , say , for you , that which is immortal is inherently good , by definition . " <p> " But not all goodness is immortal . " <p> Feingold picked up his book again . " I believe in an afterlife , " he said , " because it gives me solace , and because so many people have believed in it before me . If it is a delusion then it is an old and very decent delusion . But people are starting to come back now , with this new technology . " He looked away . " That tunnel of light . " <p> " I 've heard there 's a biological explanation for it . " <p> " Well . " <p> " Dopamine , or something . " <p> " Well , go fuck yourself , Aldo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let an old man believe what he needs to . " <p> " Sorry . That 's what I 've read . It 's all biological . " <p> " Well , go fuck yourself , anyway , " said Feingold , with more force . He closed his book . " Just wait till you 're my age . Then you 'll be happy ? I do n't think so . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> " You should be . " Feingold reclined , looked away . " There are other people in the universe , Aldo , " he said . " Pay attention . " <p> That afternoon , feeling guilty and ashamed , and sickened by Bram 's grunting , Aldo called Miranda . She picked up immediately . " Why , it 's Aldo , " she said , surprised . " The long-lost stranger . " <p> " Ha , " he said . <p> " Why have n't you been calling me ? " <p> With some irritation he said , " I have been . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Always got her housemates . " I 've left messages . " <p> She sighed . " I do n't always check the machine . " <p> " Well , I 've been calling . " <p> " I 've got something to tell you , actually , Aldo . A little surprise . " <p> " You do ? " She 'd broken it off , he thought . " What ? " <p> " I think it 's better said in person . " <p> " Okay , " he said . " There 's a movie tonight . " <p> " Fine . " <p> " I wo n't do anything , " he said . " Scout 's honor . " <p> " Oh , I would n't know a Boy Scout if I stepped on one . " <p> " Really . I wo n't do anything . " <p> " Fine , " she said . <p> " Just so you know . " <p> " I know , all right ? " <p> " Good . " <p> " So stop talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bring it up . " <p> " Look , " she said , " I 'm sorry I did n't call . " <p> " I was wondering about that . " <p> " It was a stupid thing to do , " she said . " I mean in the car . But I do like you . " <p> " I know you do . " <p> " Christ almighty , " she said , and laughed . " You 're so somber . " <p> Though he knew he had no right to be hopeful , he could n't help it . With great devotion he shaved the smooth planes of his face in the befogged mirror . Flecks of white foam dotted his earlobes . Cowardly , he was . It was cowardly to see Miranda again , rather than forget about her . Or , if not cowardly , then indulgent . He was purposefully fooling himself . Lying . <p> But he lied all the time . Despite his protestations to Feingold he did believe  --  did n't he ?  --  in something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Though if he believed in the soul , as he thought he did , then why not ? The soul takes nothing with it into the next world , said Plato , except its education and culture . That was a gratifying thought . Silly and unscientific , but gratifying . The springy air puffed through the bathroom window , drying his hair . On the twilit walk across campus through the daffodils , he felt a little shimmering  --  a faint suggestion of the old feeling  --  though by the time he met her at the theater it had gone away again . He did n't mind , really . She was lovely , as she always was , waiting for him under the marquee in a yellow dress , holding a magazine , and abruptly he had the sensation that he was exchanging something  --  trading in , somehow , the ineffable for the tangible . The loose weave of her dress . " This wo n't be very good , " she said . <p> " I suppose , " he said , " we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . Valentine 's ? No . " <p> " So , look .

" A bitter disappointment rose in him . " That 's the surprise . " <p> She smiled . " I did n't want to tell you over the phone . " <p> " He 's a lucky man . " <p> " I tell him that , too . We 're doing the ceremony this summer , if you 'd like to come . " <p> " Maybe I would . " <p> " You and your maybes . Maybe you would . " They bought tickets . <p> " It might tear my heart out .

" He followed her down to their seats . <p> " You did promise . " <p> " I know I did . " <p> Her eyes were weak , and she disliked wearing glasses , so they sat near the front , leaning back in their seats to watch . The movie was bad , and to pass the time Aldo watched the lit-up clock over one of the exits , the second hand patiently sweeping the minutes away . The stain on the screen appeared and disappeared , and he watched it idly . Now and then their arms brushed . Her lovely arms , bare , shone in the white cinematic light . At last , hopelessly , he took her hand . Married , he thought , guiltily . But she allowed it . In the dark he studied the architecture of her fingers . Each one was long and finely articulated  --  like Eleanor 's , he realized . The knuckles were boxy , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard her breathing beside him , little puffs through her nose . She whispered : " You promised . " <p> " You do n't mind , " he replied . <p> " You 're being bad . " <p> " Yes I am . " <p> " So am I , I guess . " <p> He clasped her hand more tightly . He touched her wrist : his fingertips against the soft skin . <p> " I 'm married , " she told him . <p> " Big deal . " He put his hand on her thigh . " This does n't count . " <p> " It does n't ? " <p> " No . We 're just friends . " He leaned and kissed her ear . " Does n't count , " he said . He had a terrific erection which pushed uncomfortably against his fly . He kissed her again . " Does n't count . " <p> " No , " she said . She kissed him back , her lips narrow and firm . <p> When the movie ended they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred sixty , and he could stand up and in the darkness rearrange himself without much embarrassment . Then she took his arm and led him through the rear exit , which opened onto the brick-walled alley . Against the wall they began kissing again . That he should be this close to her lovely face  --  that she should allow it  --  that she allowed his hands to travel unimpeded over her hips  --  all this was wonderful to him . At the same time he knew it was a crappy thing to do , and could lead to no good . In fact it was a very bad thing : but he did n't care . <p> " Miranda  --  " <p> " We should n't be doing this , " she said . <p> " But you want to , " he said , kissing her throat , " and I do , too . " <p> " I almost told him no , " she said . <p> " Do n't talk . " <p> " This is why I never called you . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do this , " she said , and kissed him again . <p> Presently they separated and walked hand-in-hand down the alley ; when they reached the sidewalk they let go and walked hurriedly through town . It was balmy still , and though the sky was clear the horizon flashed with heat lightning , and the elm trees moved their limbs about in the warm wind . <p> " Come back to my place , " he suggested . " It 's a nice night . " <p> " I should n't . " She clasped her bare arms to her sides . " I should n't be doing any of this . " <p> " But you want to , " he said . <p> " All right . But we ca n't do anything . " <p> " Fine , " he said , blithely , " we wo n't . " <p> " We will . " She clasped his elbow . " I know we will . " <p> " Not if you do n't want to . " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that at all . Obviously . " <p> They kept walking . As they reached the dark side streets , she took his arm again . <p> " So , " he said . <p> She stopped abruptly . " I left my magazine back there . " <p> " You want to go back ? " <p> " Yes  --  no , " she said . " Never mind . " <p> Three blocks down they came to his little house sitting on its sloppy lawn . Lights were on inside . " People are home , " he said . <p> She had grown momentarily timid . " That 's all right . " <p> He lifted the creaking screen door open . Upstairs , Bram had filled the hall with his sweaty stink , and Eleanor could be heard tamping away at her keyboard . " My housemates , " he said , and ducked with her into his bedroom , and locked the door . <p> " What are their names ? " <p> He told her . " Hear that ? " He tipped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " So neat , " she said , glancing around . " It 's like a guest room . " <p> " He does it all the time , " he said . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Bram . " <p> " Why does n't he go to the gym ? " <p> " I do n't know . They 're actually both sort of gross . " <p> She examined his bookshelf . " That 's not very nice of you . " <p> " I mean  --  I was late with the housing thing . I would n't have chosen them . " <p> " That 's not very nice , either . " <p> " I 'm being bad . " <p> " No , " she said , " you 're not being nice . It 's different . " <p> He came up behind her and spoke into her ear . " It 's not so different , " he said . He put his hands on her hips . <p> " This is the only time this is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll just get it out of our systems . " <p> Bram set down something heavy on the floor . The screws in the bookcase jingled . <p> She reached behind him to turn out the light . He opened the buttons on the back of her dress : the material was a light cotton , warmed by her skin . He took down her shoulder straps and the dress settled to the carpet . In her white underwear she was much slimmer than he had imagined : the points of her pelvis rose in little knobs . He helped her with his shirt , which slid off him easily , like a jacket off a book . A shaft of orange light from the street entered through the uncurtained window and marked a square on the wall . <p> " You 're so quiet , " she said . <p> " So are you . " <p> " I 'm just  --  I feel like  --  " She threw out her arms . " Ta daa . " Her little breasts bounced in her brassiere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " So I 'm proving something , " she whispered , " and I know it , and after this it 's forget it , right ? " She set her jaw and peered at him . " Right ? " <p> " Right . " <p> Abruptly she reached behind her , unfastened her bra , then stepped out of her underpants . " Okay , " she said , and stood naked . " You like this ? " <p> He found it difficult to speak . <p> " So somber , " she said again . <p> " I , " he said . <p> She took off her ring , set it on the dresser . " Is that better ? " <p> They climbed into bed together . He kissed her and took her breast in one hand , the nipple firm in his palm . <p> " What if I told you I was n't married ? " <p> " It would n't matter to me . " Not true , exactly . <p> She was disappointed . " Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . " <p> " Is n't it more fun if we 're  --  if I am ? " <p> " We should be quiet , " he said , and turned on the radio . " The roommates . " <p> " You care about them ? " <p> " No  --  " <p> Her nakedness had surprised him with its loveliness , the sweetness of the curve beneath her little white breasts , the inward dip of her flat , pale stomach , the fine wiry hair in unexpected abundance between her legs and across her lower belly . Beside him it tufted pleasantly against his leg . <p> " Well , " she said , " your move . " <p> " It matters to me that you 're married , " he said , " because I ca n't marry you . " <p> " No , you ca n't . " <p> " But that 's all . " <p> " He made me , " she said , kissing his throat . " He said he 'd leave me if I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He did n't believe her ; it did n't much matter . Still . " Do n't do this for me . " <p> " I would n't . " <p> " You would n't ? " <p> " No . This is for me . " <p> " What if you were n't with  --  ? Would you  --  would I  --  " <p> " Oh , do n't ask me that , " she said . " Please . " <p> Hesitantly , he asked , " Do you use any  --  are you on  --  ? " <p> " Yes , " she said , blinking . " Yes , yes , yes . " <p> Stupidly he felt as though he might cry ; but he stopped it , and turned up the radio , which crackled with the approaching lightning . Shifting his weight , he moved atop her . " Just  --  ? " he asked . <p> " Aldo , " she said . <p> His name in her mouth thrilled him . " What ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I just wanted to say it . " <p> " Say it again . " <p> She did , and he slid easily into her . Smooth and easy , all the way to the bottom . <p> " There . " She smiled up at him from her tousle of hair . " Feel better ? " <p> " You do . Do n't lie . " <p> " Yes , I do , " she said , " Aldo . " <p> " Do n't  --  " He felt himself letting go , pulled back . <p> " Your own name , " she said . " What narcissism . " <p> " Let 's not talk . " <p> " My voice ? " she asked . " Or is it just your name ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Which one ? " <p> " It 's neither . " <p> She laughed , " Aldo ! " Loud enough to be heard . <p> He would make her stop , he thought . " Elmer , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't . " <p> " Do n't ? Elmer Grand . " <p> " Oh  --  truce . " <p> " Elmer Grand . " <p> " Truce ! " <p> " Truce , " he said . <p> " You 're terrible . " She shifted beneath him , locked her legs at the backs of his knees , and pressed upward . " You 're so terrible-so bad . " <p> He supposed he was . And if that was what she wanted , then he would say so . " Both of us . You 're bad , too , " he said . " You 're so bad . " <p> " I am ? " <p> " So bad , " he said . <p> " Oh , yes  --  yes . " She grimaced menacingly , eyes shut . " Fuck , " she said , " fuck , fuck , fuck  --  " <p> Slipping in and out of Miranda he felt  --  as he had felt before , with other women  --  that he was exploring a city , an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags were hung out ... She was very firm , and he fit her with a great precision . They sweated a good deal , and their bodies , in the humid room , smacked together like fish hitting a countertop . If it was really to be only one night  --  and he did not believe this , either  --  then they were making the most of it . The storm that had stood on the horizon hours ago had come across the countryside and now walked slowly through town , delivering five or six great crashing bolts of lightning which illuminated the room-enough to see Miranda , above him , working in a pose of great determination , gazing down not at his face but at some spot near his sternum . Why , he wondered , had she agreed to this ? What did she want to prove ? That she was desirable ?  --  but no , that was only too plain . That she was unpredictable ? This was closer ; but he did n't know , and to his surprise he found he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's do something , " she told him , past two , " you 've always wanted to do . " <p> " This is about it , " he said . <p> " Something else . " <p> " Oh  --  " <p> She propped herself up on an elbow . In the darkness the whites of her eyes flashed . " Think , " she said . " Out of our systems . " <p> " Well  --  " <p> " That 's the deal , " she said . " We agreed . " <p> " I know . " <p> She sighed , lay back . " Do you want to tie me up ? " <p> He laughed . " No . " <p> " Do you want me to tie you up ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " A little bit ? " <p> " No , " he said . <p> " What , then ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " I wo n't tell anyone , " she said . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Except that , " she said . <p> " Not bad enough ? " <p> " No , it 's not bad at all , " she said , " I just do n't like it . " <p> " Just a little , " he said . <p> " I do n't like it . " <p> He said , " You should have said so . " <p> " Maybe . " <p> " Just a little . " <p> She said , " A little . " <p> " Okay , a little . " <p> " Just once , " she said . <p> " Okay . " <p> Grimacing , she made her way down his abdomen . He was sore , slightly , and he flinched when she began , taking him half-erect into her mouth . And he felt it was dirty  --  particularly since she did n't like it . The thought excited him , very suddenly . He held her head . She twisted once , stopped . Quickly he came in her mouth . Extracting himself , he pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Swallow , " he said . <p> She twisted again . <p> " That 's what I want , " he said . It was . He knew it as he said it . <p> She made a sound . Spitting , she bit his hand . " Asshole , " she said , hitting him . <p> " That 's what I want . " <p> " Asshole , " she repeated . Freeing herself , she spat at him , wiped her mouth on his discarded shirt . " Fucking shithole asshole . " Spat again , wiped . <p> He sat up . " I just thought of it then , " he said . <p> " You incredible fucking asshole . " She dressed , retrieved her ring . " Fucking shithole . Jesus . " <p> " I just realized it , " he said . What had compelled him ? He put on his underwear . <p> " Do n't say anything . " She pulled her dress over her shoulders . " I ca n't believe you . " <p> " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm sorry  --  " <p> " You 're supposed to know , " she said , " how to behave . " <p> " Stay . " <p> " Oh , you fucking asshole , " she said , loudly . " You unbelievable fucking asshole . " <p> " Do n't  --  they 'll hear  --  " <p> " He hates you , " she shouted , " he hates you both . " She swung , hit him with the sole of her shoe . " Prick , " she said . Barefoot , she walked downstairs . The screen door creaked and slammed . <p> After a moment Bram appeared in the hallway , dressed in his bikini underwear . He filled the corridor , huge . <p> " Sorry , " said Aldo . <p> " Friend of yours ? " <p> Aldo stepped back into his bedroom , closed the door . <p> Bram knocked . " Sounded bad , " he said , through the door . " Woke me up . " <p> " Sorry . " <p> " Guys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights ? " <p> " You should try it . Lose that chub . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> Bram opened the door a crack . " Want to borrow them ? " <p> " Not right this second . " <p> " Whenever , " said Bram . " You want a beer ? " <p> " No . " <p> " They 're half Eleanor 's , " he whispered . <p> " No thanks . " <p> " Say the word . " <p> " Goodnight , " said Aldo . <p> " Okay , " said Bram , " goodnight . " <p> It was essentially the last he saw of Miranda . He was ashamed of what he had done , and he was happy to avoid her when he could . He caught glimpses of her around campus , but they never spoke . Her friends eyed him unpleasantly . For the second time , she vanished from his life . Embarrassed and contrite , Aldo kept to himself . It was a terrible thing to have done , and he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about goodness , and things being right , and grace , seemed so much crap . And Feingold , though still genial , also withdrew . <p> After graduation Aldo moved back to Portland , believing he was only taking time off from his studies , that he would return soon enough , but he landed a job teaching Latin at a boys ' school in town , and the pleasures of this , and a certain lassitude , kept him from leaving . The corridors smelled of wax and the heated air that came forced through vents in the floor . His classes , full of the sons of the rich and happy , were sedate , and the boys were , as a rule , at least well-informed about things , if not always interested or original . When he turned them loose at vacations , Aldo was sorry to see them go . " Goodbye , Fitch , " he said , standing at the door , " and Gerard , and Lumber , and Poole , and Regent , and Franklin , and Vinton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they went out , loosening their ties . He was liked . The custodial staff knew his name , and Mike seemed genuinely affectionate when he arrived in the afternoon to sweep and empty the trash . <p> " Mr. Gorman . " <p> " Mike . " <p> " Not bad weather . " <p> " Little sun , " said Aldo . <p> " Oh , a little sun , not bad . Not bad at all . " <p> But it was nothing like the grace he had known : no , that had gone , seemingly for good . He was essentially friendless in the dark , gloomy city , and he remembered his college days with a mixture of nostalgia and shame , a complicated shame that had to do with , first , not going on with his education , and second , with the way he had behaved that night with Miranda . He was not civilized , not at heart . No , he was not at heart a good person , and he had proved that . And as if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track occupied by others like him : Mr. Toobman , who taught history , a sour , balding homosexual who smelled of his lemony soap ; Mrs. Graven , the shy , aged mathematics instructor whose throat was peppered with protuberant moles . Even Aldo , old before his time , had grown a gut and developed a persistent phlegmy cough . He was sick all the time . Some weeks he was mostly well , other times the cough racked him , and he would run a fever , which gave him harrowing dreams in which he grew to a terrific size , then shrank away to nothing . His heart raced , then beat lopsidedly , as though on three legs . Hacking into his handkerchief , he graded his exercises : That friendly king did not remain there a long time . Our mothers had not understood the nature of that place . He began to drink more , and thought of Feingold when he did . If this was his punishment , it was not the worst he could imagine ; and at any rate he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew he was being stupid : that holding on to a little guilt in this way was a waste of time . Forget it , he told himself . But he did n't . <p> His cough worsened that spring , grew painful , and one weekend the fever knocked him down entirely . In his chilly Saturday apartment he poured sweat terribly into his sheets . From bed he watched the sky change through its stages of gray , one layer of cloud sliding aside sluggishly to reveal another , each darker than the last . It seemed a vision of terrible unhealth , and he grew afraid . Sleep came abruptly around noon , and he woke in darkness , in what felt like the middle of the night , with his heart racing . A gurgling escaped his lungs . He had no one to call . Next door his neighbor was hammering a nail into the plaster . Sitting up in bed he gasped for breath . It was just past dinnertime . Teetering against his dresser , he buttoned his pants with trembling hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blew through his hair , wind that smelled pleasantly of the river . It would not be so bad  --  he could take a week off . And he was not all that sick , really . But his fingernails on the steering wheel were so purple they looked bruised  --  and this frightened him-as though he had grasped too eagerly at something , and had it snatched away . <p> The clinic was empty , and he was seen almost at once by a doctor whose large masculine hands , covered with red hair , pressed the glands in his throat , his armpits , his groin . The doctor looked young , not yet thirty : Dr. Grieve . " Harvard , " said Aldo , sighting the diploma . <p> " Yes . " <p> " What 're you doing here ? " <p> " This is where I live . " He peered into Aldo 's eyes . " Do any drugs ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Drink ? " <p> " Not much . " <p> The doctor sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Elmer Grand . " <p> " Oh  --  Elmer Grand , " said Dr. Grieve . " I know Elmer Grand . " <p> " Really ? " <p> The doctor peered into his ears . " Friend of yours ? " <p> " No  --  I do n't know him . I used to know his wife . " <p> " Miranda ? " <p> Startled , Aldo croaked , " Yes . " <p> " Miranda . Breathe . In . Now hold it . " He applied the stethoscope to Aldo 's sternum . " Quite a girl . " <p> He nodded . <p> " Out . " There came a long pause . " Bronchitis , " he said at last , " and sounds like pneumonia . " <p> " How is Miranda ? " <p> " Oh , well , fine , " said the doctor . " Last I heard . " <p> " No news ? " <p> " Not that I know of . It 's only a Christmas card sort of thing . " <p> " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at Christmas . " <p> " No children ? " <p> " I do n't know . I do n't think so . " <p> " Well , " said Aldo . <p> Ruefully , Dr. Grieve said , " Elmer was a hound . Anything that walked . " <p> Aldo said , " Really . " <p> " Really . And I imagine she must have known . " <p> " She never  --  I do n't remember her mentioning it , " he said . <p> " You knew her well , then . " <p> " Pretty well . For a while . " <p> " You 're pretty sick , " said Dr. Grieve . " This cough , how long ? " <p> " I do n't know . Months . " <p> " Months ? Two ? Eight ? " <p> " Six . " <p> " Any blood ? " <p> " No . " <p> " What about your heart ? " <p> " My heart ? " <p> " This kind of long-term infection , it can get lodged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It 's been fine , " he said . <p> " No palpitations ? No irregularities ? " <p> " Oh  --  " he said , " no . " A current of dread moved through him . <p> " You 're lucky , then . " <p> " Okay , " said Aldo . " Good . " <p> " So : Elmer Grand . " <p> " How many  --  " Aldo stopped . " He did it a lot , then . " <p> " Slept around ? Oh , all the time , Jesus . Sleep-deprived and still he 'd be after it . " <p> " But  --  " <p> " That 's what he liked . Likes , still . Probably . " <p> " So , " said Aldo . <p> " You should take a week off . Keep warm . Get these filled . You 'll feel better . " <p> He hesitated . " And the heart  --  ? " <p> " If anything unusual comes up , come back . " He helped Aldo off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he did get better , more quickly than he imagined possible . His lungs cleared . His heart beat normally again , in sequence . His sleep , for the first time in months , was seamless . And by Thursday he was back at school . " Copia ? " he asked . <p> " Abundance , " said the class . <p> " Yes ; ratio ? " <p> " Judgment , " they said . <p> " Yes ; duco ? " <p> " To lead , " they said . <p> Well , it was something , these voices . Always answering . They hardly asked anything of you ; and what they did ask , you could give . It was not the life he had wanted ; but it was close , in some ways . He had his languages , and he had the afternoons to himself . He thought of Miranda now and then , but less often as time went on . He had lost his way to grace , that was true . Sometimes  --  driving over a high bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday  --  he felt a sort of echo , from what might have been his soul , and then he was sorry for what he had lost . But more often he felt sorry for that old figure of himself , waiting for grace to descend , afraid when it left him . No one could live that way , not forever . It was too much to expect of life . Always waiting . No ; but he could work . A cedar tree outside the classroom window broke the sunlight , and the confetti of broken light played on the back wall of the room , where he could watch it in the afternoons . Doors closed , here and there , in the empty cavern of the school . The waxing machines murmured up and down the hallways . When Mike put down the trash can , it made a nice , hollow bonging sound ; always he put it down on the wrong side of the door , and Aldo , before he left for the night , would put it back where it belonged . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
