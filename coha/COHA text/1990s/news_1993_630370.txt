<p> Traveling in Morocco can be alternately wonderful and horrendous , a sensory explosion bursting with vivid beauty and weird , scary encounters . <p> Just three hours by ferry from the southern tip of Spain , Morocco nonetheless feels a world away . Culture shock in this North African country hits you like a million volts : Upon arrival , you 're overwhelmed by leathery-faced men wearing long robes with pointed hoods or turbans ; veiled women with tattooed hands ; deformed beggars ; donkey carts in chaotic streets ; Muslim prayers wailing from towering mosques . <p> After our rendezvous in Madrid , my companions and I rode an overnight train to Algeciras , Spain , then a ferry across the Strait of Gibraltar to Tangier , Morocco . We proceeded south by rail to Rabat , later to Marrakesh and eventually the Sahara . Our trip lasted three weeks . <p> We endured considerable hassle and intimidation in Morocco 's northern areas . To visitors it sometimes seems that Morocco is a nation of con men . Tangier , a common point of entry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their livings cheating freshly arrived tourists . <p> The hustlers walk beside you tenaciously , offering tours through the medina ( the ancient part of the city ) , or any other service that will separate you from your funds . Their intention , most often , is to lead you deep into the labyrinth of the medina , where at best they 'll guide you into carpet shops ( " open today only ! " ) or at worst rob you , often through cruel methods of extortion . ( They 're more likely to threaten to leave you stranded than to harm you physically . ) <p> The big hustle <p> " Big welcome to Morocco ! " one hustler said as we disembarked at Tangier . " The train station is right this way , sir . " He pointed to a small building near the dock . I told him I knew the station was the opposite way . " Yes , you are correct sir . May I show you the medina ? " <p> At first , not knowing how to handle the hustlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , we do n't need anything like that . Goodbye . " I tried to wave them away . That only agitated them , and they started yelling insults . " You are no better than a woman ! " one cried . ( Misogyny , or at least rampant sexism , is integral to Moroccan culture . ) <p> Much later in the trip , we discovered the most effective response often is simply to smile , pat them on the shoulder and say , " No , merci . " ( After Arabic , French is the predominant language in Morocco , then English and Spanish . ) It 's important to remain calm and confident ; the telltale expression worn by so many Americans in Tangier  --  wide-eyed , confused , frightened , nervous  --  draws hustlers like sharks to blood . <p> So why bother traveling to Morocco if it 's so rife with hassle , even danger ? It 's not for everybody , but for American travelers hungry for exotic and stimulating adventure , Morocco has few rivals . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the exchange rate was 9 dirhams for $ 1 . In the cities , you can find a comfortable hotel room for 100 dirhams ( about $ 11 ) per person , sometimes less . In rural areas , the price may drop by half . Restaurant dinners typically go for 50 dirhams ( about $ 5.50 ) . Street-vendor meals  --  a health gamble , but often delicious  --  are even cheaper . <p> Many people traveling in Spain hop the ferry over to Tangier for a quick blast of Morocco . A day trip to Tangier probably is n't worth the hassle with the guides , especially because the northern coastal city  --  often compared to Tijuana , Mexico  --  does n't represent Morocco in general . <p> If you 're coming from Spain and have at least a few days to spend , your best bet is to take the first train out of Tangier . The station is the low white building several blocks down the road from the ferry dock . <p> Take the ferry from Spain in the morning or early afternoon , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolphins riding waves in the ship 's wake . <p> From Tangier , it 's not a bad idea to go first to Rabat , Morocco 's capital and a good place to ease into the country 's cultural hurricane . During the afternoon , trains to Rabat depart every couple of hours , and the ride takes about four hours , compared to as many as eight hours to Casablanca , and 12 hours to Marrakesh . <p> Although Rabat is one of Morocco 's most Western cities  --  with abundant amenities and visible European influence  --  it also offers some traditional Moroccan sights , such as crowded markets in its medina and a lovely white casbah by the sea . It 's a good place to recharge before moving on to Marrakesh . <p> U.S. travelers who want to avoid the unnerving hassles of the north and dive right into Morocco 's best might consider flying to Marrakesh , then trekking south to the Sahara . Most flights into Morocco land first in Casablanca , an industrial city that does n't live up to its romantic image . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surrounds it , the city 's uniformly short buildings are all pale red , helping to create an almost surreal atmosphere . Myriad mosques rise above the secular structures . <p> Medina , new city <p> Morocco was once under French rule , and its large cities usually include a medina and a ville nouveau , or new city , where the most expensive hotels are often found . But the real action  --  the pulse of Marrakesh  --  is in the medina . <p> Tribal people and villagers from rural areas travel there to buy and sell goods , and to find entertainment . The medina 's main square , the Djemaa el Fna , is a virtual carnival of snake charmers , musicians , storytellers , food vendors and merchants , especially at night . <p> In the medina , you 'll find the souks  --  mazes of narrow walkways crammed on both sides with vendors in stalls hawking handmade goods , packed with an endless parade of native shoppers , the air thick with exotic aromas . Thatched roofs over the souks splinter sunlight into thin beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tradition essentially unchanged for hundreds of years . Inside you 'll find separate sections for spices , shoes , wood , metal , leather , carpets , jewelry , etc . The merchants are agressive ; some even grab your arm as you pass . Others will drop a 10-dirham note on the ground and say , " Excuse me , did you drop your money ? " It 's a ruse to get you into their shop . <p> When you want to buy , remember to bargain . Reduce the price by half , if you can . It 's a way of life and business in the souks . <p> Many of the goods are made within the souks . As you pass crowded rows of stalls , you see wood carvers in action , leather being cut and sewn , and white-hot steel being pounded into shape . Should you become lost , just keep moving  --  eventually you 'll reconnect with a familiar wider avenue . <p> Seen from Marrakesh , the jagged and snowy peaks of the High Atlas Mountains rise dramatically in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlas into the desert is an essential component of the Moroccan adventure . Transportation options include , in order of ascending expense : bus , grand taxi or rented car . We chose a grand taxi for our trip over the mountains to Zagora , then hired a second car to the Saharan outpost of Tinfou . <p> Grand taxis are spacious , powerful Mercedes sedans . Negotiating the price in Marrakesh was a lengthy , elaborate production , with a small army of street urchins hanging around wanting a piece of the action . The four-hour trip cost us about $ 20 each . <p> An hour south of Marrakesh , the landscape erupts into gorgeous red-rock mountains and canyons reminiscent of Sedona , Ariz. , but with tiered , lime-green farming plots . In the distance , the High Atlas seem impossibly enormous . Red rock later gives way to mountains covered by pale green scrub . <p> The ride becomes exhilarating  --  and at times unnerving  --  as two-lane blacktop ascends through a repetitious series of hairpin turns , vast gorges of stratified rock falling steeply away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a common way of life for rural Moroccans , dot valleys and plateaus . <p> On the other side of the Atlas , the Sahara begins . North of Tinfou the desert is generally flat , rocky , and barren except for occasional oases . Tinfou is n't a town so much as a small hotel ( the Auberge ) , built of earthen material . It 's within walking distance of an undulating landscape of golden sand dunes . A sign at the entrance says " Tomboctou 51 jours "  --  51 days , by camel , to Timbuktu . <p> Greg Beaubien is a Chicago writer . @x THROUGHOUT GEORGE W. BUSH 'S SECOND TERM , journalists puzzled over why , even after opinion polls showed Americans to have soured on the Iraq war , no serious antiwar movement emerged . More recently , journalists have puzzled over why movies about the Iraq war have done badly at the box office . The second question holds some clues to the first . A July 2007 article by Michael Cieply of the New York Times , titled " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typifies the genre . The peg was the impending release of In the Valley ofElah , a fictional film inspired by the real-life murder of an Army specialist by fellow Iraq veterans during a night of drinking near Fort Benning , Georgia . " Some in Hollywood want moviegoers to decide if the killing is emblematic of a war gone bad , " Cieply explained . Moviegoers were n't interested . In the Valley of Elah opened that September and grossed a mere $6.8 million nationwide . Even then , it was far from the least successful such film . As Cieply had noted , Irwin Winkler , director o Home of the Brave , a 2006 Iraq movie that had taken in just $44,000 , " speculated that the authence might prefer a longer interval before viewing events as troubling as war . " Cieply agreed : In the past , Hollywood usually gave the veteran more breathing space . William Wyler 's " The Best Years of Our Lives , " about the travails of those returning from World War II , was released more than a year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming Home " and Oliver Stone 's " Born on the Fourth of July , " both stories of Vietnam veterans , came well after the fall of Saigon . But this year a successful Iraq movie appeared , albeit on premium cable rather than in theaters . HBO 's February 21 premiere of Taking Chance drew two million viewers , making it the network 's mostwatched original movie in five years- and on a Saturday , no less . Within three weeks , another 5.5 million had watched . Taking Chance dramatizes the story of a Marine colonel , Michael Strobl , who volunteered to escort the remains of Lance Corporal Chance Phelps from Dover Air Force Base to Phelps 's hometown in Wyoming after the 19-year-old Phelps 's combat death in 2004 . The film 's ending is utterly predictable , but the portrayal of the journey is gripping for its depiction of the care the military shows for Phelps 's body and his personal effects , the seriousness with which Strobl ( played by Kevin Bacon ) takes his mission the troops " is too often an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strobl travels from Delaware to Wyoming by way of Philadelphia , Minneapolis , and Billings , Montana , almost everyone he meets regards him with a heightened respect , thanking him for his service and for Phelps 's sacrifice . ( The lone exceptiona sign of the times- is an officious airport security officer , who balks at Strobl 's insistence on not removing his uniform jacket or sending Phelps 's possessions through the metal detector . ) The Times 's Cieply noted Taking Chance in passing in a December 2008 report on the Sundance Film Festival , where it was screened . Director Ross Katz told Cieply that his film ( in the reporter 's paraphrase ) " stands apart from the heavy run of antiwar pictures that have populated festivals for years . " Yet it is not a pro-war movie . A few characters express opinions on the war , both for and against , but the film 's perspective is neutral . Taking Chance succeeds where other Iraq movies failed because it is consistent with the national mood- as were other successful films after other wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three men of varying ages readjusting to civilian life after returning from World War II . Each faces serious personal or professional challenges , but by the end all three seem on course for a brighter future . The Best Years of Our Lives , like Taking Chance , is apoliticalexcept for one scene in which a young Navy veteran who lost both his arms ( played by Harold Russell , who lost his arms in a 1944 Army training accident ) is confronted at a drugstore soda counter by an isolationist who tells him his injuries were in vain : " The Germans and the Japs had nothing against us . They just wanted to fight the Limeys and the Reds . " Afterward , the soda jerk , a fellow veteran , remarks , " You read about guys like that , but you do n't often see ' em . " In 1946 , it was common for men to have served , and support for the war was nearly universal . Vietnam was much more contentious , and Coming Home ( 1978 ) pushed the antiwar message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suicide of a career Army officer played by Bruce Dem , who ships out to Vietnam , leaving his wife ( Jane Fonda ) behind . Fonda , bored , volunteers at the local veterans ' hospital , where she encounters a bitter , crippled vet played by Jon Voight . Fonda and Voight meet cute when they collide in a hospital hallway and his catheter drainage bag is dislodged , falling to the floor and splashing her with his waste . Soon he shows his sensitive side and becomes number one in her heart . When Fonda and Voight consummate their affair , the screenwriters , not satisfied with cuckolding Dern , have Fonda tell Voight- and the world- that her husband never gave her an orgasm . Dern returns from Vietnam , learns of the affair , and receives a medal for accidentally shooting himself in the leg . His wife has betrayed him , his military career is at a dead end , and he is , in his own mind , a phony . He goes to the beach , removes his uniform and wedding ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . Voight , meanwhile , finds inner peace by visiting high schools , where he gives speeches denouncing the war and urging students not to enlist . To watch Coming Home three decades later is a distasteful experience . But the film was quite popular at the time , grossing some $32.7 million domes- tically , roughly 15 times the take of In the Valley of Elah after adjusting for inflation . One can see why it drew an authence . In 1978 , there were a lot of educated men in their 20s who had avoided the draft and were vulnerable to accusations that they had shirked their patriotic duty . Coming Home flattered them by telling them that they were better than those who served- not only morally but sexually . The Vietnam-era antiwar movement was politically potent because it was driven in large part by self-interest . Young men opposed the war because they did n't want to be drafted ; young women , because they did n't want their men to be . The advent of the all-volunteer military redefined service as a supererogatory act rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax to grind- including many journalists and filmmakershave an interest in perpetuating derogatory stereotypes of servicemen . As the Wall Street Journal noted in an editorial , " If Hollywood wants to make war movies that appeal to a broad authence , it could do worse than to take in ' Taking Chance . ' The Americans who show Colonel Strobl such reverence as he makes his way west are the very authence Hollywood wishes it could reach . "
