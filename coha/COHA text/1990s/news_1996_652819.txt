<p> Mohegan Sun , the spectacular , Indian-theme gambling casino that opened on Oct. 12 in this small town in southeastern Connecticut , is a dense , exhilarating forest of symbols . Trees right beside slot machines . Immense paintings of flowers over card tables . Cryptic Indian signs interspersed with flashing neon numbers . Images derived from nature  --  fish , corn , beans  --  are set within a context of heightened artificiality created by stage lights , video screens and the merry abstraction that money becomes here . In the casino 's food court , towering foam-rubber pine trees have real pine cones attached to them . <p> To those unfamiliar with either the customs of the Mohegan Indians or the rites of American gamblers , much of this sign language is incomprehensible . What compels that woman to choose this slot machine and not that one ? What is the meaning of the mandala that has been fashioned into a shade for that sconce ? Who was Uncas ? Who cares ? Shut up and play cards . <p> It 's a pleasure to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a problem . Mohegan Sun is a place that even the nongambling public can enjoy . On opening night , a spectator immune to the lure of chance could watch a wedding party cavort within the " Wolf Den , " a soaring enclosure of fake rocks , their peaks surmounted by howling white wolves , while the Everly Brothers  --  live , in person and looking better than you either hoped or feared  --  serenaded the happy couple with their 50 's hit " All I Have to Do Is Dream . " Then the bride kicked off her slippers and everybody broke into the Macarena . <p> This is a happy place , and an imaginatively realized one . Where else could you find yourself swept into a whirling phantasmagoria of winners and losers , brides and grooms , coins , dice , cards , rocks , wolves , waterfalls , stretched animal skins , forgotten teen-age heartthrobs , cloud machines and attractively decorated restaurants where an international array of one-star food is served with four-star cheerfulness . Do n't you hate yourself for lacking the imagination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's second casino , Mohegan Sun is just 10 miles from its competitor , Foxwoods Resort , operated by the Mashantucket Pequots . Developed by Sun International , a South African company , the new casino is on a site formerly used to manufacture parts for nuclear submarines . The overlay of a post-modern pleasure palace atop a base of cold war build-up will suggest to some the plot for a horror movie Steven Spielberg has yet to make . Poltergeist 1996 . Ghosts of vanished , noble Indians , angered by the installation of a nuclear power plant on their tribal lands , mutate into a ruthless gang of capitalist entrepreneurs and take Kevin Costner for all he 's worth . The casino 's design , by the New York architect David Rockwell in association with Brennan Beer Gorman Architects , invites the visitor to think in cinematic terms . It is as ambitious a piece of stagecraft as anyone has realized since the days of Cecil B. DeMille . <p> You enter the casino through corridors that suggest tunnels . The idea is that you 've walked into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melts away to reveal a clearing . The architecture per se is negligible : a corrugated metal ceiling , some exposed ducts , all painted black to create the receding space of a perpetually nighttime sky . The main gambling room below is a big circle , 360 feet in diameter , divided into quadrants . The mandala form recalls a traditional Mohegan symbol ; it also echoes the shape of the traditional Roman basilica . <p> The quadrants are named after the seasons , and decorated accordingly . Large stands of artificial trees are crowned with plastic leaves , their color ranging from winter white to spring green . A corridor running around the room 's perimeter leads to restaurants , specialized gaming rooms , bathrooms and shops . Ceiling decorations and patterns in the carpet lead one through the 13 moons of the Indian year , while large murals depicting tribal life , local vegetation and changing skies illustrate the seasonal theme . In the center of the circle is the Wolf Den , the rocky enclosure where entertainers perform around the clock . <p> The immense space is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of fake wood , designed to evoke the structure used in Mohegan long houses . Clipped to the trusses are stage lights and simulated stretched animal skins that diffuse golden light into the circular space below . The scale and variety of the decorative elements break up the huge space into areas of intimacy . Most of the new American gambling casinos are architecturally ambitious . But usually the architectural images  --  pyramids , water displays  --  do not intrude on the casino floor . Mohegan Sun may be the first where the slot machines are actually upstaged by their surroundings . <p> The effect is by no means as kitschy as it sounds . Clearly the designers have taken great care to learn about the Mohegans . This is not a museum ; no attempt has been made to recreate actual Indian buildings or other artifacts . Instead of creating an environment of dubious authenticity , the designers have created an informed and witty collage of stylized Mohegan motifs . The result may be synthetic , but not more so than the current constitution of the Mohegan tribe itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's scattered descendants and financed their application for recognition by the Federal Government . That 's why the casino now exists . <p> The paradox is that whatever its motives for doing so , the casino has actually revived the Mohegans ' sense of tribal cohesion . And while the casino 's setting is synthetic , it exercises genuine power . The circle of trees evokes memories of cruel children 's games , fantasized rituals , tortures , secrets and exclusions . Like the cave , the tree circle recalls architecture 's primitive roots . Even if you ca n't understand the Indian pictograms , you can respond to primal power of place . <p> The Indian symbols are not the only things that are hard to decipher . The casino itself , as a building type , is a sign that the society at large is trying to interpret . <p> Is it a sign of prosperity ? Communities across the country are looking to casinos to salvage their blighted economies . Is it a sign of decline ? The historically aware point to 18th-century Venice as a warning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sign of hope ? Who enters a gambling casino without expecting to win ? Or one of despair ? Do n't these people do n't have something better to do ? <p> But probably most people are fascinated by the casino for the same reason that they 're fascinated by explicit sex scenes in mainstream Hollywood movies , the lyrics of rap songs , the unbuttoned patter on radio talk shows . The casino signifies the shattering of a moral taboo . Anyone old enough to be admitted to a casino grew up in a culture that placed gambling , along with cursing , drinking and prostitution , on the list of Bad Things . Indeed , in most parts of the country , gambling remains illegal . That is why the Indians have captured this market . Legally , Indians exist outside the borders of this country . They are exempt from the laws in which America 's moral prejudices have been inscribed . <p> Yet tribal law prohibits the Mohegans from playing here . And the people you do see hardly look held in the grip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily engaged in a pleasant pastime that , even now , moralists still thunder about . There 's even an arcade for children , with no money involved , called Kids Quest . In short , gambling has come into our lives under the sign of Evil . Can we afford to inch it over toward the column called Good ? Can we afford not to ? <p> Linguistics is one of the strategies used at Mohegan Sun to engineer this shift . By dropping two letters , gambling becomes gaming , a word with a far more respectable aura . The Indian theme is another strategy , evoking , as it does , the history of oppression by European settlers and the lingering need for restitution . The architecture adds to these factors the dimension of sacred space . This is a basilica here . You 're in church ! <p> The larger issues raised by Mohegan Sun may fall outside the purview of an architecture review . But it is n't exactly a work of architecture . Like much , perhaps most of American architecture today , it fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's design is a habitat for tribal behavior . The tribe conducting its rituals here is not the reconstituted Mohegan people . It is the " non-native " Americans lining up to enter the Wolf Den . The tableau is handsome , but it does n't have much to do with art , for the reason that it does n't have much to do with life . It 's rather about escaping life , about checking out of history into a prehistoric year of 13 lucky moons . <p> Mohegan Sun is perhaps most fully understood as a symbol of American life in the post-cold-war era . In place of the East-West polarity , we 're faced with a vast and growing gulf between winners and losers . Mohegan Sun defends the border between them by denying with great artistry that it exists . It 's a big , glamorous wheel of fortune designed to suggest that the difference between winning and losing is just a matter of chance . <p> Map of Connecticut highlighting Mohegan Sun Casino .
