Section : Prevention Special Report Here are 12 ways to get the care you need " My doctor never listens . " <p> " She kept me waiting for an hour , saw me for 8 minutes , and wrote out a $150 prescription I could n't afford ! " <p> " He should have known something else was wrong . It 's not up to me to tell him everything . " <p> " I ca n't help it . I remember important things just as I 'm leaving the office-so I bring them up , and my doctor looks annoyed ! " <p> Do you ever leave the doctor 's office with unanswered questions , unaddressed medical problems , pricey prescriptions , and follow-up appointments or treatments that do n't fit your busy schedule ? <p> If so , do n't dump your doctor . Instead , learn the unwritten rules that can help you speak up and be heard . <p> " In a survey done by Louis Harris and Associates , 90% of physicians believed that serious health problems could be averted if patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MD , a family physician in Newton , NJ , and former chairman of the communications committee for the American Academy of Family Physicians . <p> What 's more , studies show satisfied patients are healthier . Rushed Doctors , Reticent Patients <p> What probably leaves you feeling most unhappy with your doctor is the feeling that he did n't listen to you-and that you did n't understand what he said . And that , for the most part , is caused by rushed doctors and reticent patients , says Barbara M. Korsch , MD , a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles and author of The Intelligent Patient 's Guide to the Doctor-Patient Relationship : Learning How to Talk So Your Doctor Will Listen ( Oxford University Press , 1997 ) . <p> Rushed doctors are a fact of life . They 've got more paperwork than ever before . Some doctors overbook as a hedge against cancellations . Some do n't leave enough room in their schedules for emergencies . Many others are required to follow the unwritten 15-minute-per-patient policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who has booked the doctor 's time-namely , you-not want to talk ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dress up for your visit ; you could get better care . <p> In a national survey of 1,008 adults , 25% said they were afraid of bad news or scared about treatment options . Seventeen percent said there just was n't enough time . Fifteen percent said that they felt embarrassed . Still others simply felt intimidated by the person in the white coat . <p> Fortunately , there 's a lot you can do to maximize the 10 or 15 minutes your doctor allots you . And there are plenty of ways to make yourself feel more comfortable speaking up about what ails you . Here 's what our experts suggest . Six Secrets of a Successful Preparation <p> 1 . Write a detailed overview . Scribble down the facts behind your health concerns . Richard Sribnick , MD , an internist in Columbia , SC , and coauthor of Smart Patient , Good Medicine ( Walker and Company , 1994 ) , suggests you make sure you answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where is the problem located ? <p> Location is crucial , so be specific . " Think about a headache . Head pain over your sinuses will have a very different cause than pain over your temples or at the back of your head , " explains Dr. Sribnick . <p> How do you feel ? Describe how often you experience discomfort , and how long it lasts . Again , be specific . Say something like , " It feels sharp and piercing , happens five or six times a day , and the pain lasts for half an hour each time . " What brings on the problem ? What relieves it and what does n't ? <p> You might say , for instance , " Hunger and stress seem to bring on these headaches . Aspirin makes it feel a little better . " <p> Why do you think you 're having this problem ? For example , " I know high blood pressure runs in my family . Do you think that 's why I 'm having these headaches ? " 2 . Call for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you need to see the doctor . This information helps office staff set aside the right amount of time for your visit . If you have more than three or four problems to discuss with the doctor , you 'll need extra time . So ask the receptionist to schedule two separate appointments . 3 . Schedule a prime time slot . <p> To reduce time spent waiting , request the first appointment after your doctor 's lunch break . Second best is first thing in the morning . 4 . Dress for success . Unless you know your doctor will only see you in an examining gown , dress up for your visit . Nix sweatsuits and old sneakers and choose casual business attire . People who dress up actually receive more respect and more attentive care . 5 . Bring your " tools . " Have ready your written overview of your problem , your insurance information , some paper and a pen for taking notes , and money for parking . It 's no fun circling the block or running to the cash machine when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : You have about 18 seconds to talk before your doctor interrupts . <p> 6 . Think twice about friends and tape recorders . Afraid you 'll forget your doctor 's advice once you 've left the office ? Rely on pen and paper . Leave your tape recorder at home and park your companions in the waiting room . Both may seem like innocent memory aids , but these strategies could backfire . Your doc may fear you 're lawsuit-happy and clam up if you push the " record " button . Or she may be concerned you wo n't express yourself fully with a friend or family member listening in . <p> " Of course , everything 's negotiable , " Dr. Korsch notes . " There are times when a tape recorder is a great idea , or you really need someone to help you remember something . Just tell your doctor first thing why you 've brought one or the other along . " In the Doctor 's Office <p> Once your doctor enters the exam room , the interview part of your appointment begins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doctor interrupts with a question , so here 's how to hit the ground running . Outline your concerns . Briefly tell your doctor why you 're there and what 's bothering you most . Say , for example , " I have three important things to discuss with you today : recurring headaches , fatigue , and a refill of my blood pressure medicine . The headaches bother me most . " This helps your doctor accommodate all your concerns and ensures that you wo n't find yourself bringing up something important in the final seconds of your visit , says Timothy B. McCall , MD , an internist in Boston and author of Examining Your Doctor : A Patient 's Guide to Avoiding Harmful Medical Care ( Birch Lane Press , 1995 ) . Refer to your notes if necessary so you do n't forget . Expect r-e-s-p-e-c-t . Many doctors call patients by their first names to establish rapport and trust . Yet few of us call our doctors " Barb " or " Jim " or " Marty . " If this name inequality leaves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really prefer being called Mr. Anderson . " Speak up . Lost in medicalese ? Feel uncertain about how serious the diagnosis really is ? Ask for an explanation you can understand . Say , for example , " I did n't understand that . Could you say it again ? " Or , " I do n't fully understand those medical terms . Can you explain it another way ? " Practice the art of tactful interruption . If you feel your doctor is n't listening to your concerns or is n't allowing you a chance to give her important information about your symptoms , be ready to break in-gracefully . Say , for example , " Dr. Jones , I do n't think you realize how upset I am about these headaches . What do you think the cause is ? " Be direct but not accusatory , Dr. Sribnick suggests . " And do n't feel intimidated if the doctor interrupts you . She may be trying to clarify something . " Save nonmedical complaints for last . Doctors do want to know if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking difficulties , or billing mix-ups . But raise these concerns at the conclusion of your visit , Dr. Sribnick says . Bringing them up sooner could take time away from your health concerns . Before You Leave <p> So you 've had the interview , the exam , and now , your doctor 's flashing the " time 's up " signal : She 's scribbling something on a prescription pad . " When you 're given a prescription , do n't just say thank you and walk out of the office knowing you ca n't follow it , " says Dr. Korsch . " Be honest . If a prescription sounds unnecessary or too expensive , or if you ca n't stop four times a day to take it , say so . " There may be alternatives . Then ask these questions : Why am I taking this ? How will I know it 's working ? What are the risks or side effects ? Are other treatments available ? How long should I take this , and will the continued need for treatment be checked from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not happy with a prescription or treatment option , tell your doctor . <p> If your doctor also schedules tests , find out how soon you 'll get the results . Ask the doctor or a staff member to call you whether the results are normal or reveal a problem . " Tell the staff when it 's good to reach you , " Dr. Kane suggests . " If it 's okay to call you at work , say so . " And if you do n't hear from them , call . If your treatment includes a hospital procedure , discuss these questions with your doctor and with the surgeon : Why do you suggest surgery , and what will happen if I do n't have it ? How soon do I need it ? What are the risks ? Do doctors agree that this is the best treatment for my condition ? Can I find new or experimental treatments for my condition elsewhere ? <p> Need to mull over a medication , procedure , or test ? Tell your doctor that you need to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , suggests Dr. McCall . " If you 're feeling uncomfortable , you could simply say , ' I 'd really like to talk with my family about this first . Can I call you with my decision ? ' " he says . Never feel pressured to agree to any treatment that you are not absolutely certain about . <p> And find out what things you can do at home to help control and improve your condition , adds Dr. Korsch . There 's rarely a problem that is n't helped by regularly eating nutritious foods , doing specific exercises , or practicing stress reduction techniques . <p> To receive a FREE copy of the Prevention handbook , " The 10 Most Important Steps to Getting the Best Medicine from Your Doctor , " send a self-addressed , stamped envelope to Spirit of Women , Prevention Magazine , Attn : JoAnn Kelly , 33 E.

Six Important Clues <p> Do n't start a search for a new doctor until you discuss your dissatisfaction openly with the old one , suggests Richard Sribnick , MD , an internist in Columbia , SC .

" Maybe your doctor does n't have the greatest bedside manner but is otherwise very competent and can help you get good medical care . " <p> Still , most experts say it 's time to end the relationship if your doctor ... puts you down or judges you . does n't exercise good medical judgment-orders the same test several times when once would do ; does not perform thorough physical exams ; or minimizes serious side effects or risks of a treatment . blocks your attempts at communication or makes you feel so intimidated you do n't speak up . is n't interested in your worries and concerns . ignores psychological and social causes of illness , as well as job-related health problems . is disrespectful or verbally abusive to you or others . <p>
