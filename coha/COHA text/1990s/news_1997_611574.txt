<p> Sokha Irene never knew the Khmer Rouge regime firsthand . She was born in 1979 , just after the radical communist movement led by Pol Pot was driven from power by invading Vietnamese troops . <p> But in her work as a part-time staffer at the Documentation Center of Cambodia , she has become intimately acquainted with the Khmer Rouge terror , helping the center to assemble evidence of the regime 's crimes . That effort hit home one recent day when Irene came across a familiar name . <p> Dy Phon , a French-educated dentist , had fled Phnom Penh in 1971 to join the Khmer Rouge in their fight against Cambodia 's U.S.-backed government and had disappeared . Now Irene suddenly knew his fate . His unfinished " confession , " recovered from Pol Pot 's infamous Tuol Sleng prison , showed that he had been sent there in December 1978 , just before the Vietnamese invasion , making him among the last of its estimated 20,000 inmates to be tortured and killed . <p> Dy Phon was Irene 's uncle . <p> Practically every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975-79 rule , which left at least 1 million people dead and the country in ruins . Many of the survivors still do not know exactly what happened to their loved ones , or why the regime behaved as it did . <p> The reported  --  but still unconfirmed  --  capture of Pol Pot last month by renegade Khmer Rouge guerrillas raised hopes that Cambodians would finally get some answers . The Cambodian government demanded that he be turned over for trial before an international tribunal , and the U.S.-funded documentation center went into overdrive to prepare for a possible crucial role in backing up charges that Pol Pot committed crimes against humanity . <p> Since then , the breakdown of negotiations for Pol Pot 's handover and a coup July 5 by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen have dimmed the prospects that the Khmer Rouge leader will ever be brought to trial . Now , Cambodians are left with the painful memories that the episode raised , and the documentation center has resumed plowing through Khmer Rouge records in hopes that justice will someday be served . <p> Located on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovation , the center was set up two years ago as a branch of Yale University 's Cambodian Genocide Program , which has received $ 1.5 million in U.S. government grants to help document Khmer Rouge atrocities . <p> According to Youk Chhang , the center 's Cambodian director , the office has amassed a mountain of evidence , much of it generated by the Khmer Rouge 's own penchant for record-keeping as part of a " bureaucracy of death " that sent legions of perceived enemies to the regime 's " killing fields , " usually to be murdered with clubs or farm implements and dumped in mass graves . <p> The evidence , Chhang said , includes more than 500,000 pages from secret Khmer Rouge files and a large trove of documents , assembled by the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government between 1979 and 1983 , that contains petitions signed by more than 1 million people and survivors ' accounts of deaths and destruction . In addition , there are thousands of confessions , biographies and photographs from Tuol Sleng prison , reports from mapping teams that visited 129 sites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Khmer Rouge depredations . <p> " All of this is like a puzzle , " Chhang said . No single piece tells the story . " But if you put the pieces together , you see the evidence . . . and it becomes the whole big picture of the genocide of Cambodia . " <p> Among the Khmer Rouge records , he said , are minutes of top-level meetings that show Pol Pot and other regime leaders were well aware of the widespread killings . " They knew every move of their revolution , " Chhang said , and thus bear collective responsibility for its excesses . <p> The documents also include records of alleged Khmer Rouge " traitors , " whose confessions were sent up the chain of command to Pol Pot from the director of Tuol Sleng prison through the Khmer Rouge defense minister , Son Sen , and his wife , Yun Yat , the minister of propaganda . The two were killed last month with their family and bodyguards in a purge reportedly ordered by Pol Pot at a Khmer Rouge guerrilla stronghold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutiny by Khmer Rouge guerrillas , who are reported to be holding their ailing former leader at a house close to the Thai border north of @x Veng . The remaining Khmer Rouge hierarchy , which apparently includes longtime front man Khieu Samphan , feared guerrilla commander Ta Mok and a younger corps of political and military leaders in their forties , sought to negotiate a deal with then-First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh for amnesty and inclusion in a " National United Front " that Ranariddh had formed to compete in elections next year . <p> Charging that Ranariddh was bringing Khmer Rouge guerrillas into Phnom Penh to bolster his forces , Hun Sen launched a coup , ousted his co-premier and began hunting down top royalist officials . <p> Even before the coup , however , prospects for a trial of Pol Pot seemed to be fading . China , the main backer of the Khmer Rouge during and after its reign of terror , opposed an international tribunal , signaling it might use its veto to block the U.N . Security Council from establishing one . An alternative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , foundered . <p> Some Cambodia scholars also questioned the strength of the Khmer Rouge paper trail , asserting that legal challenges could be raised about the archives ' chain of custody and that prosecutors might not be able to produce any document in which Pol Pot directly ordered someone killed . <p> Regardless , Chhang said , Pol Pot " must be held responsible " for the crimes of the regime he headed . Even if he never comes out of the jungle alive , other Cambodia analysts said , an accounting of the Khmer Rouge rule is still needed . Besides Pol Pot , " thousands of accomplices " committed violations of international law , said Craig Etcheson , manager of the Cambodian Genocide Program at Yale . <p> According to a 1992 demographic study by the U.S. Census Bureau 's Center for International Research , famine , disease , overwork and " targeted slaughter " accounted for about 1.05 million " excess deaths " during the Khmer Rouge rule . Historian Ben Kiernan , the director of the Yale program , has estimated the death toll at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Chhang , the difference is academic ; whatever the exact toll , the memories and the trauma are no less painful . <p> Mostly , he remembers a girl he knew only as Comrade Oun . Although she was only about 12 years old , she was the Khmer Rouge staffer appointed by Angkar , the term for the Khmer Rouge leadership , as the chief of Chhang 's village , which consisted of about 1,200 families forcibly evacuated from Phnom Penh and resettled in Battambang Province . Known as " new people " who had not previously joined the revolution , evacuees were treated especially harshly . <p> " Comrade Oun told us that Angkar had sent her to look after us , " Chhang said . In fact , as he found out over the next three years , " Angkar had given her orders to kill us . " Of the village 's 1,200 families , he said , all but 13 were exterminated . <p> A disciple of the brutal Ta Mok , Oun was one of thousands of peasant children whom the Khmer Rouge brainwashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victims , Chhang said , were one of his sisters , a brother and a brother-in-law . <p> Chhang , who was 14 at the time of the evacuation , speaks vividly about the terror he felt near the end of Pol Pot 's rule while passing row after row of empty houses once occupied by his neighbors . " I felt like a young boy walking into a ghost village , " he said . <p> Although Irene was not yet born when any of this happened , the part-time staffer , who also is a student , finds it difficult to talk about . An older sister she never knew died of starvation during the regime , and a cousin , a young girl , " was killed without any reason , " she said . <p> The fate of her uncle , however , remained in doubt . " Some people told us he had died . Others told us he was still alive , " Irene said . " Many people in my family talked about him . He was well educated . He got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted until she came across Dy Phon 's 89-page " confession , " written over the course of a week . " He confessed to every single thing " that the Khmer Rouge might consider an offense , she said , " even going out for a drink . " Although he did not mention the kind of treachery or espionage other prisoners confessed under torture just before their deaths , the paper showed Dy Phon had been held at a jail from which only a few people emerged alive . <p> Holding a copy of it , Irene 's hands trembled slightly . " After reading this document , we were sure he was dead , " she said . <p> " But I still do n't know why he was killed . "
