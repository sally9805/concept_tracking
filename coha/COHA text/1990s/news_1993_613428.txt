<p> Gwen Torrence of Decatur is the most outspoken female track and field athlete in the United States , and there 's no stopping her , on or off the track . Torrence won two gold medals and a silver in Barcelona , and despite injuries to both legs will compete at this week 's national championships . <p> The Olympic gold medalist was hot and did n't want to be bothered . She showed up at a local all-comers track meet because she needed competition , not attention , and would have loved to disappear into the crowd of athletes . <p> But she was spotted - a large towel draped over her head - walking up the far straightaway . Those legs give her away every time . <p> Gwen Torrence ca n't hide , but she can run . <p> Torrence , who Saturday turned what she called " 20 big fat 8 " is cautiously rehabilitating both legs in preparation for this week 's USA/Mobil Outdoor Track and Field Championships in Eugene , Ore . The Decatur sprinter does n't know if she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she must finish in the top three in an event to qualify for the World Championships in Stuttgart , Germany , in August . <p> " Kids ask me a thousand questions , " said Torrence , who left the track with a gym bag full of addresses and promised to send autographed trading cards . " One little girl named Ashley has been writing me and said she 's praying for my leg . I just can cry over these little children . <p> " And they 're so funny . One little girl asked me , ' How do you run that fast ? ' " <p> A bigger question for Torrence is : Can she run fast enough to win more Olympic gold in her hometown in 1996 ? <p> Since she won two golds and a silver in Barcelona , Torrence 's training regimen and eating habits have changed ; she has been dogged by injuries which never affected her before ; her world view has broadened with a trip to South Africa ; she has overcome shyness to make public appearances ; and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cancer-stricken boy who sent her a Mother 's Day card . <p> And Torrence still finds the time to supervise the construction of a five-bedroom , 4 1/2-bath house in Lithonia - an improvement over the Decatur duplex she shares with husband/coach Manley Waller and their son . <p> It 's a home fit for a queen - the queen of the U.S. sprints . In the post-1992 rankings , Torrence was No. 1 in the country in the 100 , 200 and 400 meters - more top rankings than any other athlete - and was No. 1 in the world in the 200 . <p> Through the 1992 Olympic Trials and Games , Torrence was injured , but determination drove her across the finish line . However , she did n't rest the injury sufficiently after Barcelona , and there 's recurring pain behind her left knee and a new hip flexor problem in her right leg . <p> " You ca n't run on bad legs against good people , " said Torrence , who plans eventually to buy an insurance policy for her legs , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm going to be able to suffer though the pain or not . But my confidence feels better because I can lift this left leg up . " <p> She said the World Championships in Stuttgart are n't that important to her , especially since she won two silvers in the 1991 event and did " fairly well " at the Olympics . " If I do n't do well , I 'm not going to crawl up and die , " Torrence said . <p> Torrence , whose son , Manley III , is now 3 1/2 , originally wanted to have another baby this year . However , the decision to hold the World Championships every two years instead of every four " put my plans a little bit on the back burner " she said . " If I had known it was going to be this hard this year , I would have stuck to Plan A. " <p> She says she has no desire to be a marketing superstar - she feels it interferes with training - or gain recognition on the awards scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered from a debilitating thyroid disease , has been her sport 's nominee for post-Games awards and has appeared on television shows such as the recent Essence Awards . <p> " I 'm not really into that , " said Torrence . " I would n't have gone anyway . It would have taken away from my training . " <p> But she added , " I feel if they had gone on accomplishment only , I probably would have done better . That Graves Disease story got blown so far out of proportion . . . If she had gotten third , honey , I do n't think they would have talked about it so much . I think that won a lot for her . Not to take anything away from 10.82 seconds , Devers 's time in the Olympic 100 . That time was real fast . " <p> Some observers would blame the modest interest in Torrence on her outspokenness and the controversy which erupted in Barcelona when she charged that three competitors , whom she declined to name , were aided by steroids . In seminars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of what not to say and do at the Games . The USOC forced her to issue an apology , using the threat of suspension before the relays . However , she later stood by her original remarks . <p> Even friends call Torrence " the Charles Barkley of track and field . " And she likes the comparison , although she 's only met him once . <p> " He and I think alike , " she said . " When white people say something , it 's an opinion . When blacks say it , it 's a controversy . " <p> Torrence does n't shy away from controversy . <p> " I 'll probably get criticized for this , " she said , " but a lot of people use the sport after the Games for endorsements . I do n't use my running toward that . <p> " I think that causes people to think about cheating , " she said , conversation inevitably returning to her anti-drug crusade . " They think if you do good in the Games , it 's going to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lot of people are trying to use what I had to say about drugs as a reason for me not getting certain endorsements . I do n't think that 's what it is . It 's because I did n't win the 100 , the glamour event . " <p> Torrence said she has " turned down more things than people imagine , " which are mainly public appearances . She was irritated when a commitment to Ray-Ban , one of her sponsors , disrupted her training . <p> " They Ray-Ban have n't commercialized me yet , " said Torrence . " I do n't know if they plan to . I do n't really care . The money is still the same . I 'm not going to mope about it . It 's not all about being seen . It can be annoying sometimes , like when people ask for autographs while you 're eating . " <p> Her agent , Brad Hunt , is talking with Coca-Cola and Chick-Fil-A about involving Torrence in projects in the Atlanta community . <p> Waiting to test market <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what level of appearance fees outdoor meet promoters will pay her . Hunt did turn down some indoor appearances because he felt Torrence was undervalued . <p> Depending on her health and performance at the U.S. nationals , the fee will go up or down from last summer . <p> " I understand it 's a business , " said Torrence , for whom running is a living , as well as a way of life . A top American woman can get as much as $ 15,000 per race . <p> Torrence has done some globetrotting the past few months , competing in South Africa in December , then Martinique , Trinidad and Brazil , where she was injured in mid-May . <p> She said she could n't pass up the chance to go to South Africa , " to see what all the hoohaw was about . " <p> " The black people who worked in the restaurants could n't believe a black person was coming in to eat , " she said . " They would get so excited , and we were treated like kings and queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe blacks can afford to eat in here . ' People would come out of stores and watch us go down the street . " <p> More relaxed schedule <p> Back in the States , with the pressure of the Olympics relaxed for the next couple of years , Torrence now has more freedom in her schedule . <p> " This year she might go to the mall before she comes to the track to train , " said Waller . <p> Torrence is more of a wife and mother , he said , and cooks dinner regularly . She has eliminated red meat and says she no longer makes secret trips for hamburgers . <p> Torrence 's immediate goals are to run the best time in the world each year and a personal best . She accepts that " I will never break a world record , " because Florence Griffith Joyner 's times are so far out of reach . FloJo 's record in the 100 is 10.49 , set minutes before Torrence ran a wind-aided 10.78 . The wind reading was 0.0 in FloJo 's race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Wo n't try double in ' 96 <p> By 1996 , she will be focusing on either the 100 or the 400 - she already has her gold medal in the 200 - and has no intentions of doubling because it would be too tough on her 31-year-old body . <p> " Gwen is such a hard trainer , the majority of her injuries come because she overworks and does n't want to slow down , " said Waller . " She has to learn to pay closer attention to her body . " <p> Torrence feels 1997 will probably be her last competitive season . She hopes to have another baby , and perhaps go to cosmetology school and open a salon . <p> " The only thing I like other than running is doing hair , " said Torrence . <p> It was Torrence 's hair that attracted her pen pal from Michigan . Joey , who has cancer , said he saw her on TV in the Olympics and thought her hair was gorgeous . In his next letter , the boy , whom Torrence thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome her injuries . He sent the Mother 's Day card because his own mother died when he was 3 . <p> " He said he 's surprised he wakes up every day , " Torrence said . " He gets weaker and weaker . He 'll say he does n't want to bug me , but the only thing that lifts his spirits is knowing I 'll write him . " <p> She hopes to write good news about Eugene . <p> If not , " I 'll come home , rest my little bones , go to Europe and try to win some races , " she said . " I 'm not going to have any excuses . I know when I 'm healthy , it 's a different story . Maybe the prayers Joey has will work for me. "
