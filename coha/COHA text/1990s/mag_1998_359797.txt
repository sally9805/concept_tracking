In four 90-minute episodes , this documentary attempts to tell the story of slavery from 1619 , when a ship carrying a cargo of Africans arrived at Jamestown , to the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 . The material is inherently fascinating , and overall the producers have done a fine job of presenting it , combining historical images , impressionistic re-enactments , interviews with historians and voice-over readings of letters and diaries ( the narration is spoken by Angela Bassett ) . If there 's a quibble , it 's that the re-enactments , done in soft-focus and slow motion , are overused , and one wishes for a fuller description of the slaves ' separate culture . Nevertheless , the viewer will come away with a vivid understanding of how slavery flourished in the land of freedom and what costs it imposed . <P>  --  By James Collins
