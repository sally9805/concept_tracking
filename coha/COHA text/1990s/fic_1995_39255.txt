Elna had once said that beautifying was nothing more than grabbing Mother Nature by the throat and showing her who was boss . When Shelly arrived for her appointment , her friend was vigorously at work on an alabaster-complexioned teenager . Testimonies of terse , coiled ringlets spiraled downward at the girl 's ears and the back of her neck . <p> " Hey there ! " Elna called as Shelly settled into a chair across from what they laughingly called " the hot seat . " <p> " Where 's your cat population ? " Shelly asked . She unbuttoned her coat and slipped it onto the back of the chair . Elna 's cats had become a quick barometer for the household 's travail since Elna 's marriage had been in trouble . No matter in what state she arrived , Shelly always felt strangely cheered by the prospect of Elna 's troubles  --  maybe because they were harder to solve than her own . <p> When Elna and Eugene had tried to split up the previous year , the clients had commiserated with Elna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " only along for the ride , " etc . But in the end , Elna had let him stay , and her clients now kept their opinions to themselves . <p> This time around , Eugene was calling the shots . The day after New Year 's , he 'd announced he was moving out , but not until spring , when an apartment he wanted would come available . Elna had complained so bitterly about the marriage earlier that her friends were astonished she 'd agreed to this . But theory had it Eugene might settle more congenially if she did things his way . Shelly knew it was harder for Elna to let the marriage go , now that Eugene was the one heading for the door . Still , things had been building up . <p> In the months prior to their current situation , Eugene had been giving all the signs of a man having an affair  --  late nights , strange excuses . Once , he 'd even called Elna to say the gold cap on his front tooth had fallen into a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he 'd phoned from a training session in a nearby town . He 'd been learning to install a new kind of insulation . The afternoon meeting was supposed to allow him to come home that night , but he 'd called Elna with a change of plans . He said his hemorrhoids were bothering him . They were so bad , he could n't make the two-hour drive home . He 'd have to spend the night there alone , in pain . He was sorry . He was having to stand up while making this very call , he said , an odd catch in his voice . Elna 's friends said it did n't sound like your regular excuse . He 'd also started bringing home single rosebuds wrapped in cellophane from the supermarket . Out of the blue , he 'd call Elna from a pay phone to say , " Hi , honey , just wanted you to know I love you . " <p> It had been hard for Elna to believe Eugene had somebody on the side  --  even harder to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too willing to confirm the diagnosis . She 'd had her own experiences with cheating men . She 'd been glad to share with Elna an article in a women 's magazine that told all the signs . " Constant irritability and fault-finding "  --  those were two they 'd agreed especially fit Eugene . <p> As she settled herself in her chair , Shelly continued to scan the shop for the cats . When she did n't see them , she called to them by name . Elna , who 'd been methodically swiveling the curling rod to the teenager 's head , withdrew it and stepped over to Shelly . She bent and , in a confidential tone , said , " Honey  --  Lucky and Lightning are no longer with us . They 've gone where all good , but sadly flawed creatures go Then she retreated to her client , having seemingly dispensed with a very unpleasant matter . <p> Shelly tried to absorb what she 'd heard . Clearly things had taken a desperate turn . She consoled herself , noticing that the remaining young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays of afternoon sunlight . She nudged the cat with the toe of her shoe , and its eyes blinked open and shut several times , as if completing some coded message from a dream-filled interior , then shut them . <p> " I wish I could have gone with them , straight to Kitty Heaven , " Elna was saying . " Do not pass Safeway or Twelve-Star Video . One minute the needle , then poof ! Heaven . " <p> The idea of heaven had always eluded Shelly , and , linked to " kitty , " the word only revived images of the two missing cats , stranded in some lonely outpost of the mind . They had been fixtures the ten years she 'd been coming to the shop , always curled in one chair or another . Each time a client uprooted them , they would tolerantly re-situate themselves . <p> Lightning , a huge white cat with a streak of black down one side , was forever inviting himself into a client 's lap and having to be scolded down . The other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep of the world . She had once crawled into the clothes dryer for a nap and managed to endure several minutes on Knits/Gentle/Low with a load of bikini panties . " If she 'd been on Cottons , she 'd be looking up to the mice , " Elna had quipped . She 'd been affectionate about even the failures of her cats . It was hard to believe she 'd had them put to sleep . <p> Recently Shelly had heard on a talk show that willful deaths or injuries to innocent pets often signaled a worsening of relationships between their owners . Elna leaned against the mirror that ran the length of the room and appraised the rather glum-looking teenager undergoing transformation . " Lucky , with her own little motorized tongue , licked down an entire cube of butter , then did her job in my yarn basket . One of the clinchers , " Elna said . " They just got too old Shelly did n't contradict her friend , though she suspected age had nothing to do with it . <p> " Veronica , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat , " to be young and in control of your functions-house-trained like the rest of us . " <p> Shelly had been feeling the closest thing to joy in a long time when she 'd entered the shop . She had n't been prepared to hear about the disposal of Elna 's cats , and was dismayed at how suddenly any relief in life could be so quickly burdened again with sadness . Her eighty-year-old mother had gone through a diagnostic test that afternoon which had taken longer than expected . During the test , Shelly had sat with a magazine on her lap , imagining the long thin probe being worked into her mother 's stomach and upper intestines while the doctor 's eye searched for the reason she had been bleeding . Shelly had mentally entered that darkness as a small wink of light grazing and scraping the deep interior . The trouble with the imagination , she thought , was that the mind could %o anywhere , so you could never tell from one moment to the next where you might end up . <p> The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer or ulcers , but miraculously nothing had been found . She had come to her hair appointment prepared to celebrate her mother 's good fortune . But the deaths of the cats had changed all that . <p> " Oh , honey , we were just bawling our eyes out after I took them to the vet 's . My clients sat in their chairs and cried , and I blubbered right along with them , " Elna said , bending to the teenager . " Cousin Flo came over on her lunch break to say goodbye to them . Then I closed those poor babies into the same cardboard carrier and drove them to the clinic . " <p> To be shut into a small dark space against your will was one of the most frightening things Shelly could imagine . Her mind veered out of the box with its doomed cats and back toward her friend . Shelly could see Elna did n't know at all how to represent what she 'd done . She was alternately hot and cold over it  --  pitying the cats while trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells on the shop door jangled , and Gretchen , Elna 's daughter , entered with her two children . Her face looked puffy to Shelly , like a person who 'd been either hit in the face or crying , or both . " I need some of your magic hair spray , Mom , " Gretchen announced . She picked peppermint candies for her children from the fishbowl which had been converted to a candy dish when the fish were found floating belly-up one morning . " Hey , it 's like a funeral in here . " <p> " If you only knew , dear , " Elna said . <p> " She off-ed Lucky and Lightning , " said the teenager , like the surviving member of a Greek chorus . <p> Gretchen made a sound deep in her throat  --  an eruption that sprang from the unpredictability of human utterance itself . <p> " I ca n't believe you did that , Mom , " Gretchen said , holding her children by their jacket collars to keep them from taking another step toward their grandmother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scramble for it outside Elna said , ignoring her . " But I would have been worrying all the time . Besides , it 's cold out there , and if something chased them  --  " <p> " My cat sleeps with me , " said the teenager , a beacon of ruthless insinuation . <p> " Lightning slept with me , too , " Elna said quietly , making clear that no amount of intimacy could have staved off the inevitable . " The last straw was him spraying down the floor vent . We breathed cat piss for a week . I dumped cologne , Purex , baby powder , a bottle of cedar scent down it  --  even got back into my hippie days and burned incense . " <p> With the cats gone , the shop felt larger , less cozy . Shelly noticed Veronica had moved to the back of a chair at the window , one paw V-ing the Venetian blind where she gazed into the yard . " She 's looking for them , " Elna said . " She ca n't imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she mused , " forever expected in Veronica 's cat mind . " <p> " We did n't even have a funeral , " Gretchen said , plaintively . <p> " Flo and I thought about going sentimental , burying them in the backyard with two little stone markers from one of those catalogues , but I chickened out , " Elna said . " No  --  they just went into the incinerator . ' Cremate them : I told the vet , ' and do whatever you do  --  I mean , when no one takes whatever 's left . ' " <p> At the mention of the backyard , Gretchen 's children wriggled from her and eased out the shop entrance . Shelly wished , for a moment , she could go with them . She knew Elna made light of things when she felt them most , that she would be cryptic with bursts of admission until she had eroded some kind of invisible barrier between her actions and her feelings . <p> " Honestly Elna said , " Lucky would sashay in from the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walked through , lift her leg , and spray , right in front of me ! " <p> " I did n't know female cats lifted their legs Shelly said . <p> " This one did . Lifted it just like a Tom , smart as you please , and shot her tank . Then she 'd prance off like she 'd accomplished something . " <p> " Little did she know , " Gretchen said . <p> " You bet , " Elna said , with muscle in her voice . " The Kevorkian of cats had called her number . " It was five o'clock . Elna walked over and closed the Venetian blinds . " Open them , shut them . Who cares ? " Elna said . She returned to the girl in the swivel chair and rotated her toward the mirror . <p> Elna 's swirling of the chair , then stopping it , steadied everything for a moment . With the blinds closed , the eyes of the shop seemed closed , and Shelly felt the particular intimacy of women alone in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Kimberly 's wearing forest green to the prom , " Elna said , her voice rubbing the consonants in " forest green The ebony of trees at dusk entered Shelly 's mind  --  a pungent , under-boughs ' darkness that overpowered the smell of hair spray mingled with cat urine . She imagined night falling in the forests on the mountains behind the town , the creatures alive there , able for nights and days in snow and rain , searching for food , for shelter . <p> A strong draft ran through the shop as Gretchen 's children burst into the room again . " Stay inside , please , children , or stay out , " Elna said . Shelly realized eerily that Elna was using the same tone with the children she 'd used with the missing cats . The children had just dropped to their knees in the middle of the floor with the black cat when the shop door suddenly opened and Eugene entered . He veered around the children and , without a glance , shot past everyone into the kitchen . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing look . <p> " Mom , okay if I make a long distance call ? " Gretchen asked , seizing the moment . " It 's about a job . They shut off my phone Shelly saw Elna go into her stoic helpful-against-the-odds mode . <p> " Use the kitchen phone , " Elna said , " but make it snappy . " <p> Shelly could feel how stretched beyond limits Elna was because of Gretchen , yet she knew Elna would likely do a lifetime of setting aside boundaries for her daughter . Shelly hated her friend 's helplessness , but she also took pity and even admired her , because at least helplessness meant you were out there in the deep water , risking things . Her friend lived somehow beyond the prudent , fix-it mentality of others she knew . For Elna , things were patently wrong , and they were going further in that direction , no matter what Shelly or anyone wished for her . She tried to imagine a life where Elna would n't be burdened and ensnared , but no matter what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon Gretchen could be heard laughing and exclaiming through the open door to the kitchen . She was always " looking for a job " or " about to get a job In this , it struck Shelly , she was n't so different from Eugene . After a few minutes , the register of her voice shifted , and she could be heard talking to Eugene . Her tone was placating , the way someone who is used to calamity tries to soothe away consequences . <p> " All that room out there ! " Eugene suddenly blurted . All that ocean and forest , and she has to ram a goddamn California lawyer with two kids in a goddamn camper On the way into the house , Eugene had spotted a dent Gretchen had left in his pickup , Elna stopped what she was doing to listen . <p> " Why not ram the ocean ? Something with a little give and take , " Eugene cried at the top of his voice . " Aim for an oil tanker , be ambitious  --  a raft of logs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ranted . " <p> " Eugene 's off his spool again , " Elna said , a high ripple in her voice meant to counter his tirade by seeming to indicate the malfunction of an ordinary household appliance . Eugene had always claimed that Gretchen 's problems , her sudden incursions on his and Elna's-lives , her bad choices in men , two children by an absent father  --  these ongoing pressures had made it impossible for him and Elna . To a certain extent , Shelly thought he was right . Whatever faults Eugene had , no one could dispute the fact that he 'd been an absolute natural , a veritable blue ribbon champion , at living with things in a mess . He reentered the beauty shop now , drawn backwards by some invisible force centered in Elna . <p> " You never asked me , " he said to the company at large , his back to Elna . " The queen of demolition derbies , and you loan her my truck like loaning a can opener . " <p> " My God , Gene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly grazing his attention . <p> " I ca n't get over it , " he said . " Snuff the cats . Ram the truck . <p> guess I 'm lucky to have a door to walk through . " He hitched his jeans and ducked to look at himself in the mirror . His black hair roiled in a glistening wave he pushed back from his forehead . <p> Shelly noticed Eugene had dark circles under his eyes and he 'd lost weight . So had Elna , for that matter . She 'd always been wasp-waisted , but now her skin seemed oddly transparent , as if everything inside , the entire circuitry of her body , were visible to whoever came within her parameters . Eugene disappeared into the kitchen . <p> Elna spun the prom girl toward her and gave her a hand mirror so she could see the back of her head . " Mister Righteous , " Elna said . " ' Honey , honey , ' he 'd say  --  ' there 's a mess in here . You might want to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ! " <p> The prom girl stared into the mirror , adrift on the small bright raft of her face in a shark-infested sea . She bobbed her head , and the drooling curls danced briefly . <p> Meanwhile Gretchen 's children had forced the surviving cat under the nail-polishing table . Shelly had the all-encompassing sensation that places of refuge were thinning out across the face of the planet . Soon enough , if a human impulse fixed its mark on a creature , it would be found and destroyed . There could be delay , but no lasting retreat . Maybe it had always been this way , and she was just now realizing it . <p> " You 're going to look amazing in that forest green , " Elna said to the teenager . " If that boy was shy before , he 's going to be speechless now The girl pulled at the neck of her T-shirt and frowned . <p> It was clear the shirt would n't lift easily over her hairdo . <p> " Is that expendable ? " Elna asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Darlin ' you 'd be surprised what 's expendable by the time you get my age . " Elna reached into a drawer and took out a pair of scissors . <p> " I still do n't see how you did what you did , Mom , " Gretchen said , reentering from the kitchen . She was speaking to her mother in the mirror . " Just because you and Gene are n't making it . We had those cats fifteen years , " she said . " You 're mean . Just plain mean ! " Shelly could tell her friend was carefully not letting herself be provoked . <p> Elna took the scissors and began a vertical cut from the girl 's neckline between the hints of her breasts . The scissors snipped viciously in the silence of the beauty shop . When she finished , she dropped them into the drawer , then slid it shut with a decisive thud . <p> From the kitchen , a loud cascading of pans sounded . Eugene swore , and Shelly looked up to see him pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women in the shop , then broke away into the kitchen again , having evidently collected fresh energy from just glancing at them . <p> Child voices murmured from under the table . Shelly felt an undercurrent in the room , as when messages and secrets are being exchanged . She remembered what it was to be a child , crawling into the musky darkness under beds and tables , able to hear everything that went on ; being there , yet not there . Once <p> pan of grease on the stove had caught fire while she 'd been exploring the space under her parents ' bed . Her mother had run through the rooms , carrying the flaming pan , yelling , " Fire ! " and calling for her in a tone of ultimate panic , which changed to fury when she 'd eventually discovered her under the bed . Even to this day , Shelly instinctually connected certain states of anxiety and threat with fire . <p> " Things are going to change around here , " Elna said . " I see to everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , dear , " she said to the girl . Elna helped the prom girl lift the T-shirt over her head through the rough slit . The girl sat uneasily a moment in her bra until Gretchen reached into the little side room where her mother mixed hair colors and handed her a flannel shirt . The girl slipped into it quickly , shyly . <p> " Kimberly 's going to dress in my bedroom , " Elna said . " I told her I 'd do her hair for free just to see her in her dress . " <p> A mournful howl came from the cat , then giggling from the children . Their legs spidered from under the frilly table . " To-To , come out ! " Gretchen called to her son . When he did n't appear , she pulled him forth like a wheelbarrow by his legs . <p> " After what she did , I 'm scared to leave my kids with her , " Gretchen said . She took up a comb from the counter and raked it across her son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching the glaring cat by its middle . <p> Shelly was used to the charade of Gretchen and her mother fighting over the children . She 'd been in the shop once when Elna had called the Children 's Protective Services , threatening to take them away . But since Gretchen left her children with Elna most of the time anyway , the threat was empty . <p> " When I was pregnant with her , " Elna had told Shelly , " if I 'd known the trouble I was in for , I 'd have climbed onto the roof and dashed myself to the pavement like a watermelon . " <p> The prom girl slowly eased into the doorway . Everyone had turned to look . Eugene was visible over one bare shoulder in the fluorescent kitchen light . Gretchen pulled at one of the small gold rings in her nose and , with her eyes on the girl , sat down under a dryer that was cocked open near Shelly . <p> The girl rustled forward , leaving a cool tracing of air in her wake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she glided to the center of the room and turned , her arms lightly at her sides . Like a calm fir tree in their clearing , she stood for a moment , then began again to turn , slowly , like someone at the center of a dream who did not see them , or if she did , saw them from far away . <p> Suddenly the black cat let out a long , involuntary moan . It struggled free of the child 's grasp and leaped precariously onto the swivel chair . Before they realized what was happening , the cat was midair in a short unwieldy arc toward the girl 's bare shoulders . Its claws sank into the pure fleshy center of the room . The girl gave a raw cry of pain . If an eagle had dropped onto her shoulder to lift her from earth , she would have given such a cry . Poised , electric , the cat stared violently at them from its human perch . <p> Elna rushed forward with her face turned away , like a woman about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur and flung it from the girl 's shoulders against the mirror . For a moment , the animal appeared to be leaping out of itself , multiplied , quenched and resurrected at once as it rippled along the counter , then became airborne again , clearing the fishbowl before it dropped to the floor and streaked past their ankles . The girl began to shudder , then to sob openly , holding herself . <p> When Shelly moved , it was to Elna . She caught her friend firmly by the shoulders and held her . " There , " Shelly said . " There She took Elna 's helpless blows against her back until they subsided . The cat had made its escape through the kitchen . Shelly imagined it tunneling into the farthest recesses of the house . <p> When Elna broke free and turned to the others , it was clear she 'd crossed some boundary , from which she looked back at them like one who holds territory and holds it beyond challenge . Everyone else in the room balanced unsteadily on the rim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads at once . Night had fallen suddenly in their clearing . Each of them gazed warily out of the darkness at the others with the lime-green eyes of the young black cat , a creature forced to its limits and past . <p> There was unearthly calm and stillness in the space they now inhabited . They seemed suspended in the dose chemical smell of the room , but elsewhere in the house , they heard things falling , glassware shattering  --  the racing , desperate plunge of an animal seeking its full measure of darkness . <p> Shelly stared at her friend and realized she did n't know what Elna might do next  --  that everything , and everyone , had somehow been reduced to their simplest , most destructible element . She was aware that her childhood dread of fire was unreasonably and wildly alive in her . Whatever was flammable in the room rose to make itself known all at once  --  the nylon flounce along the mirror , cans of hair spray , raw clumps of hair at the base of the swivel chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hair on her head . The hair on all their heads . A woman with a pan of fire seemed to be running through her mind , fanning oxygen into flames , igniting whatever she passed . Shelly knew she and the others had arrived at some precarious boundary between what was human and what was not  --  where , despite their strongest instincts , they seemed to have agreed that no one would run from this room . <p>
