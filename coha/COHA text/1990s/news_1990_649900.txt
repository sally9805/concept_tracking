<p> To the Editor : <p> The foreign-trade deal the Bush Administration has negotiated with Japan ( front page , June 29 ) follows the thinking of the Reagan Administration and will continue the giveaway of essential interests of the United States . Because it assumes that unregulated foreign trade - always called " free trade " - automatically benefits both nations involved , this viewpoint makes light of the one-sidedness of United States trade . The net takeover of our markets by excess imports , and the shrinkage of our industries and jobs , is attributed to some outside factor , and token policies are devised to deal with these imaginary causes . <p> Thus , the real causes of the self-destructive pattern of United States foreign trade were not touched by the Reagan Administration 's initiating unfair trade practices investigations or getting commitments from other countries to increase their " economic growth . " Neither will they be touched by the Bush Administration 's getting Japan to increase its public-works spending , to speed up the issuing of patents , to reduce protection of small shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be desirable , but their effect on the huge United States trade deficit with Japan will be long delayed and trivial . Saving the economic future of the United States requires the regulation of United States imports to bring about balanced , two-way-benefit trade with countries that differ from us in economic policies and institutions , market sizes and qualities , wage levels and other ways . <p> The widening spread in American incomes and the worsening plight of our ordinary workers is shown by data and has been viewed with concern by many commentators . Americans were once proud of being the only country where the factory parking lot was filled with the workers ' cars - cars of one-income families . Two incomes may not permit workers to raise a family in today 's United States , and the situation is continuing to worsen . <p> History provides an illuminating parallel . The ancient Roman Republic became politically unworkable largely because the jobs of ordinary Roman workers and small farmers were taken over by cheaper outside labor , in this case by burgeoning use of imported slave labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans . Thus , " the free market " said , " Use the slave labor . " Doing so enriched Roman landowners and the affluent . But the shift to slave labor took away the jobs of ordinary Romans , who had been the backbone of Rome 's armies and state . They became an unemployed proletariat in the city of Rome , degraded by politicians ' free bread and circuses - and Rome as a republic stopped working . <p> The United States turned the jobs of its ordinary workers over to outside labor - because it was cheaper than American labor - by accepting imports vastly in excess of our exports , imports that are cheaper than American-made goods because of foreign wage levels a tenth or less as high ( as was initially true of Japan , which now relies on other advantages over United States production ) . One-sided immigration of low-wage labor has the same effect . The Americans whose jobs are given away to outside labor , like the pauperized Roman workers and farmers , will not go away . They have no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , the part-time jobs , the minimum-wage jobs without job security , medical insurance and retirement benefits do not permit them to live and raise a family like other Americans - not even when both spouses work . What is to become of these people ? What will become of a United States in which groups not subject to such foreign competition live extravagantly , while the ordinary workers thrown by one-sided foreign trade into wage competition with the poorest of the world 's burgeoning millions of poor become outcasts in their own country ? <p> The economic theory on which United States policy is based evades this problem by assuming an imaginary world in which unemployment is cured by lowering wage levels , where foreign trade and job shifts automatically balance out and where cheaper implies more efficient . Laissez-faire economics and the Bush foreign trade policy perhaps would work in this imaginary world - just as Communist economics perhaps would work in its imaginary world . <p> But in the world of reality , the United States is self-destructing in permitting one-sided " free trade " to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign workers who can live on much less than they . This kind of " free trade " may be a time bomb of laissez-faire ideology more deadly even than " free " savings and loan association pillaging , " free " airline mergers , " free " **27;102;TOOLONG takeover deals , the " free " selling of America to foreigners and " free " government spending without taxes .
