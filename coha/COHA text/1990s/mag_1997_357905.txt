Launching the Million Woman March of African Americans in Philadelphia with her familiar clenched-fist salute , Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was , as usual , center stage on her recent visit to the U.S. But back home last week , the ex-wife of South Africa 's President faced a less flattering limelight . It was her turn to go before the country 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on human-rights violations during the apartheid era , and the testimony there further clouded the reputation of the woman once called Mother of the Nation . <P> Or Mugger of the Nation ? That 's what some South Africans have been calling her since 1991 , when she was convicted of kidnapping and fined $3,200 . The case against Madikizela-Mandela ( she added her maiden name after the 1996 divorce from President Nelson Mandela ) arose out of her involvement with a bunch of young Soweto Township toughs who called themselves the Mandela United Football Club and acted as her bodyguards . In 1988 the gang abducted four youths from a township mission house , and one of them , a 14-year-old activist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later found murdered . The " coach " of the " football team , " Jerry Richardson , was convicted of the murder . <P> During the course of her trial , some of the defendants and witnesses disappeared , and later some said they had perjured themselves to protect Madikizela-Mandela . From his prison cell , Richardson claimed she not only ordered Seipei 's murder but also told him to kill another youngster , a girl she believed to be a police informer . Last week Katiza Cebekhulu , who said he was smuggled out of the country to prevent his giving testimony linking her to a number of Soweto murders , was one of more than 40 people called by the Truth Commission to testify to the activities of Winnie Mandela . Pointing his finger at her , the slightly built , nervous Cebekhulu declared , " I saw her kill Stompie . " She shook her head , shrugged and turned away . <P> Most of these allegations have already been published ; she has denied them all . She lost her cool once last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facing private prosecutions for the death of Seipei and another Soweto activist . " I do n't give a damn ! " was her shouted reply . <P> With the welter of claims and counter-claims and evidence that has been contradictory and based on hearsay , it is unlikely that the Truth Commission will come to any significant conclusion . Of more concern to many South Africans is the fact that Madikizela-Mandela has been nominated to run for deputy president of the majority African National Congress when Nelson Mandela retires as party head this month ( he will remain head of the government until 1999 ) and his deputy , Thabo Mbeki , becomes party president . <P> Even if she loses , Madikizela-Mandela is still a Member of Parliament and continues to embarrass the A.N.C . with attacks on the government 's integrity and its failure to deliver what the masses want . The Truth Commission hearing is not a trial , but it could find her responsible for what a leading witness , Methodist Bishop Peter Storey , called " a ruthless abuse of power . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , there will be many who believe that Madikizela-Mandela 's transgressions were committed in the struggle against apartheid and that she should be praised , not pilloried . <P>  --  By Peter Hawthorne/Johannesburg
