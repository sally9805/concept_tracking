<p> Earl A. Powell 3d , director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington , was there . Glenn D. Lowry , director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York , was there . James N. Wood , director of the Art Institute of Chicago , was there . And so were the heads of many more of the nation 's art museums , as well as a few dozen assorted curators and museum trustees , art history professors and gallery owners , all graduates of Williams College and all gathered for a gala evening at the school 's faculty club . <p> With the trees outside drenched in brilliant yellows , oranges and reds , it looked as if a large swath of the art world had fled city life for bucolic New England . <p> And so it had . But these art powers had another purpose in mind as well . The group , known as the " Williams art mafia , " had come to celebrate the 90th birthday of their godfather , S. Lane Faison Jr . With his contagious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had years ago transformed a band of would-be doctors and bank presidents into art history majors , leaving an indelible mark on the field . <p> " I came to be a pre-med student and ski , " recounted Mr. Lowry , describing his conversion in a toast to Mr. Faison . One Saturday in the early 1970 's , while mounting slides in the college museum to earn spending money , Mr. Lowry was interrupted by insistent pounding on the door by a woman who wanted to see the museum , which had closed for the day . He had just turned her away when along came Mr. Faison , offering a personal tour . <p> " Off we galloped , " Mr. Lowry said . " We spent hours there , and I was transformed . It was magical , the enthusiasm that Lane brought to looking , and it was then that I knew there could be nothing more noble or significant than this pursuit . " <p> Similar stories were told again and again at the dinner Friday night and in separate interviews with former students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whitney S. Stoddard , 84 , and William H. Pierson Jr. , 86 , who together made this elite liberal arts college into a fount of art professionals . <p> Among them , in addition to Mr. Powell , Mr. Lowry and Mr. Wood , are Thomas Krens , director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York , John R. Lane , who until recently was director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , and Robert T. Buck , former director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art . <p> Mr. Faison 's own epiphany came a bit earlier in life , and it proved to be life-shaping for him and for Williams College . At 16 , while spending a year living in Switzerland with his family , he was visited by a high school teacher who volunteered to show him France . One day they went to Chartres . Though he knew no art history , he was sent inside the cathedral to view it on his own . " I have n't been the same since , " Mr. Faison said in an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chartres , he learned the power of observing the object , and the importance of training the eye instead of stressing the memorization of places , dates and abstract theory , the more standard pedagogy . As he taught , beginning in 1936 , after earning a bachelor 's degree from Williams and master 's degrees from Harvard and Princeton , he made connoisseurship his hallmark . <p> To hear his former students tell it , Mr. Faison used the familiar slide projections , but his passion for the object affected his words and infected his listeners . It colored the way art history is taught at Williams , where Mr. Faison was department chairman from 1940 to 1968 and a full-time faculty member until 1976 . He was also director of the college 's museum , which claims a collection of 11,000 objects spanning the history of art . Art history classes here almost always take place in the college 's museum . <p> " We were surrounded by real objects , and we 'd pass the objects around , " said David P. Tunick , a prominent Manhattan art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attended Williams in the 80 's and is now director of museum and corporate services at Christie 's , recalls many field trips to museums in Boston and New York . <p> At many other schools , art history majors get little or no museum experience , and rarely are students as intimate with the works . <p> Mr. Faison also devised unusual assignments . Mr. Tunick remembers having to compare the novel " Tom Jones " with a Hogarth painting , and Arthur K. Wheelock Jr. , the National Gallery curator who organized its landmark Vermeer exhibition two years ago , recalls having to compare the experience of viewing a painting with that of viewing a reproduction of the work . <p> In his classes , Mr. Faison regularly turned works of art upside down , sideways and backward for study , partly to see whether the composition held together . " I do that with my students now , " said Franklin Kelly , who did graduate work at Williams and now teaches at the University of Maryland ( as well as being a curator at the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned his Ph.D . at the University of Delaware , deploys other teaching tactics from his days here as well . " I make my students stand in front of an object and talk to people about it  --  that 's another Williams thing , " he said . " We are so visually overloaded that we expect to get everything in a flash , but making students talk makes them slow down , because they usually start by describing everything in the painting . " A Nagging Doubt : Is Art Manly ? <p> Consciously or not , Mr. Faison , Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Pierson also addressed the unstated doubts of adolescent men that art might not be a manly concern ( Williams began to admit women only in 1970 ) . " One thing that was special here was that art was such a regular thing to do , " said Mr. Wheelock , one of the few who came to Williams knowing he wanted to enter the art world . " It was n't a weird thing . " The three professors cheered on sports teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " men 's men . " <p> Like many beloved teachers , Mr. Faison took a keen interest in his students after graduation by helping them get jobs and writing references . He also gave frank , if somewhat self-enhancing , advice to the likes of Mr. Powell , still another former pre-med major , who switched to art after barely passing the first semester of introductory chemistry . After graduation and a stint in the Navy , Mr. Powell considered going to architecture school and asked Mr. Faison for a reference . But as Mr. Powell told it , the reference was not forthcoming . " ' That 's stupid , ' he told me , " said Mr. Powell . " ' You should go into art history . It 's the only thing you were ever good at . ' " <p> Though so many of his students now run museums ( technically , it is those who graduated in the 1960 's and early ' 70 's who are known as the " mafia " ) or are curators , Mr. Faison said he was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided the classes taught by Paul Sachs , whose students from the 1930 's and 40 's dominated the previous generation of museum directors . <p> " I was going to be a teacher , " he said , wearing relentlessly tweedy clothes and his perpetual bow tie and looking , with a slight smirk and twinkle , as if he was about to create mischief . In fact , although Mr. Faison has written a few books and many articles , he is not known as an authority on any artist or period . <p> More simply , he proposed , " people say I opened their eyes . " Mr. Faison insists he never intended to dispatch so many students to the top of the museum world , and he is quick to cite graduates who teach art history , like James Morgenstern at Ohio State University and Paul Hayes Tucker at the University of Massachusetts at Boston , or run galleries , like Mr. Tunick and Maxwell Davidson , another Manhattan dealer . <p> Some quibblers , of course , are not pleased that so much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white , mostly Anglo-Saxon Protestant men , all from the same small college . Mr. Faison has only one word in response . " Tough , " he said . <p> As Williams has become somewhat more diverse in recent years , a few more varied faces have potential to be made members of the mafia : Lucinda Barnes , curator of collections at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago , for example . <p> But even Williams 's president , Harry C. Payne , is reluctant to predict that Williams graduates will continue to dominate . " A remarkable moment of the 60 's led to the situation now , " he said . Williams believes it has the highest concentration of art history majors of any liberal arts school in the United States : more than 8 percent . But Mr. Payne said he did not know whether the mafia " is sustainable . " <p> At the gala dinner , a few members poked fun at the phenomenon . Rising to toast Mr. Faison , E. Roger Mandle , president of the Rhode Island School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , in a black suit with wide pinstripes , a black shirt and a white tie . <p> By his own admission , Mr. Faison 's own family did not succumb to his enthusiasm . None of his four sons chose art as a profession . " But I got two teachers out of it , " he countered , along with a psychological counselor and an investment manager . <p> Still , he did convert his wife of 62 years , who died in January . When they met , and he told her what he did , she replied , " Oh , art history  --  I hate it , " Mr. Faison recalled . Later , he said , he found out she had a marvelous eye : " I changed my opinion many times because of her . " <p> Chart : " Launching a Thousand Curators " Many former students of S.
