In her letter starting below and continuing on the next pages , author hattie gosset tells her niece about the bad old days ' when sex was wild and free . But in this age of AIDS , celibacy looks more and more appealing // Dear Ms. One , Sure was good seeing you when you breezed through town last week . I just wish you could have stayed longer - I really wanted to continue our conversation about celibacy . Since you left , I 've thought of so many things I want to share with you . But first let me say hallelujah for you ! How did you find a single man with no children and no ex-wives ? I mean , Marcus not only has a good job , a good head on his shoulders and a vision for the future , but he 's also not trying to jump into bed with you at his earliest convenience . I think it 's so healthy that the two of you have decided to take some time to develop your friendship before crossing the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was your age I could n't wait . Now that I look back on that time , I see so clearly that I used sex as a way to rebel against my parents ' rules . But then again , all the kids were doing it . We just flat out shattered the social mores-not even realizing that we had started a sexual revolution ! Things that your generation now take for granted , like the Pill and legal abortion , were n't always there for my generation . By the same token , you have a major obstacle we never had to face . AIDS has changed everything ; it 's so unfair . Speaking as your jazzy , mature diva aunt who 's been to the other side and back , I can assure you that sexual freedom is the liberty to open your legs-and to keep them closed . So I encourage you and Marcus to take all the time you need . And do n't feel alone . Nowadays a lot of people are considering celibacy-and not just because they 're between relationships . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they choose it or it chooses them , worry that it 's gon na last forever . ( Sometimes it definitely feels that way ! ) But worrying about it just seems to make it worse . If we could just relax and trust the process and find a way to tune out all the messages urging us to rush in , we 'd be okay . And besides , while some people do celibacy straight , no chaser , there are pretty creative ways to spice up the " time off " with lots of stimulating fantasies and plenty of self-pleasuring . Now I 'm not gon na sit up here and pretend that celibacy ranks right up there with great sex . And I 'm not gon na play down the longing that goes along with the desire to have that itch scratched - particularly if you 've been in a relationship where you 've gotten used to having it , and now you 're not . As you would say , that 's no joke . But believe me , sex is not like food or air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fact as a young woman in the midst of a breakup . It helped me get off the couch , put down my cocktail and quit listening to all those " How come love do n't love me ? " records . I began to remind myself of my fabulousness and of how lucky the next person would be who got to experience my deluxe delights . That 's when I determined that if it took six months or a year or even longer for me and that lucky person to find each other , so be it . It was only through trial and error , though , that I finally began to appreciate why waiting was better than settling for less . In the process , for me , celibacy has become an act of personal power and choice , not a state of lack . I learned to redirect my energy into other areas of my life , and good things started happening . I published two books of poetry and got a grant to do a workshop around one of my performance-art pieces . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's in harmony with my values sustains me through those times when love seems to be lingering too long on the horizon . The attitude shift that came along with my new consciousness ultimately made me more attractive to others . I had a program ; I was about something . I was n't waiting to be defined by my association with someone else . Initially I had n't chosen celibacy , but I learned to work it to my advantage and to treasure what it taught me . But enough about me . One of the things I wanted to share with you when you were here was the sweetest conversation I had with my little friend Neecie . She lives in my building , so you 've probably seen her . She 's the tiny one with dimples and purple designer braces . One day when we were down in the laundry room , I asked her how school was going . She said that she had made the honor roll again , and that she and a group of her girlfriends were so committed to staying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pact not to " do it " - at least through high school . Then she pulled out a little leather choker with a silver locket that she says symbolizes the pact she and her girlfriends have to remain virgins . I look at Neecie and I know that if she sticks with her program , she 'll probably avoid the hard times that Sharon 's been through . Sharon is an ex-student of mine who 's adopted me ; she wrote that poem- " Strong Women Keep Getting Up " -I have posted on my fridge . Sharon 's a witness . She 's been raising her two children for years without much help from her ex . Sharon often says that " love and marriage come and go , but children are forever . " In the few years that Sharon 's been divorced and out of the dating scene , she says she 's really grown up . Sharon has built her career as a paralegal and sees a future for herself that she could never have imagined before . She 's secure in the knowledge that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to enjoy sex again-and again-with the right partner . But right now she 's holding out for a man who 's really committed to being there for her and her kids . It just occurred to me , as I was writing about Sharon , that refocusing my sexual energy ushered in a period of deep spiritual reflection for me . Not being " out there , " I 've had more time to ponder life 's big questions like Who am IP What is my purpose on this planet ? and What would give me the ultimate sense of fulfillment in my lifetime ? These larger questions seem to be at odds with the ways society prefers to sell sex to us . Society wraps sex around a product and tells us to buy it now-without concern for the consequences . A sistafriend and I have talked about the dangers of this way of thinking . She 's a reverend , and her concern is that sex-and the way it 's peddled to us-puts too much emphasis on power , manipulation and selfish satisfaction , which completely undermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I 've given you an earful , sweetheart , so I 'm gon na close for now . Please let Marcus know I look forward to meeting him . I trust that you two will continue to step to your own rhythm . Do n't let nobody turn you around . And by all means , write back soon . Love ya ! P.S. Next time you cook black-eyed peas , try seasoning them with sauteed fresh cilantro , garlic , onions and some ground red pepper . Do n't add the seasoning until just before the peas are done so that the full flavor comes through . I tried it yesterday , and the results were amazing . You wo n't even miss the meat !
