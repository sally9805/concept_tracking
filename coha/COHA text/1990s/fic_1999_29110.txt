The road is narrow and rolls up and down in hesitant , not-quite hills that capture all the half-hearted defeat I once saw at the heart of this country . I park on the edge of town . There is no one here who would welcome me . I sit in the car , watching snow slant across the hills and the sad little town , and after a while a strange thing happens . I am looking at a field , the gaunt figures of bent cornstalks leaning together into the gray distance , and it comes alive . The world of my memories is lined with the faces of strangers , and now they rise pale and attenuated in the wintry light , pale but hopeful , raised and always hopeful , as if the most delicate of all emotions has gathered substance in the flesh . We were , in the end , just another road show , another carnival in a world jaded by spectacle , but in the beginning there came these moments when the crowds gathered in the summer twilight and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and feel it against your palm . There was a night when we arrived late at a small southern town in a state I have long forgotten . They had been waiting for five hours and the noise started even before we left the buses . We walked through the crowd and they were cheering us for no reason , leaning across the rope and clapping , slapping us on our backs , and soon we were all running , running in this narrow space between thousands , carried along by the sound , flying through the darkness until we came out into the space reserved for us and we saw the courthouse brilliantly illuminated , a Georgian wedding cake , white as a bridal gown , curved pillars suspended in the air by light . He was standing on the porch with his wife , swaying to the music , and their shadows were thrown up huge and black against the wall . It was August but a girl in an Easter dress , her black hair in a white bow , walked up to the microphone and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guileless you had to close your eyes , and the crowd fell into a hush , and before he even spoke , you could feel it gathering and you knew that there is nothing ephemeral about hope ; gathered , it is a force like the wind that bends trees and blows rooftops into the sea . Then he spoke . He took off his jacket and it was n't long before he sweated through his blue shirt . He went through all he would do in his gentle midwestern voice , that voice in which the words each did their business and got out of the way . I wo n't let you down , he said . I wo n't fail you . I will be there . There has been enough blame . There is a time for trust . There is a time to believe in each other . There is a time to say we have forgiven and we will move forward . There is a time for hope . He stood with his shadow swinging back and forth across the courthouse and when you looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you could feel everything they wanted to believe pounding like a rush of blood into your temples . When they cheered the sound seemed dragged up from the earth itself . That night I believed he would do it . I knew I wanted him to , despite all my protestations of neutrality , and I thought he would . I thought he would be the next president of the United States and I thought he would be a good one . I want you to know that I too believed . I want you to know that I shared your hope , maybe more than most . I want you to know I too could see it , the kingdom of the wish coming alive . I want you to know so you 'll understand that I ruined him for something else . I told myself once it was for the truth , the last excuse for every cruelty . But now I think it might have been for much less than that . I think maybe I ruined him because I could not believe in something much smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chapter Two I first met him on a snowy morning in Concord , New Hampshire . I was standing on the statehouse square across from the beetle-browed statue of Daniel Webster , which glowers eternally at the ostentatiously golden-domed capitol , when his van came down the street and he got out looking for hands to shake . There was no one around . He stood on the sidewalk in a charcoal gray topcoat , the snow falling in flecks into his coal-black hair , his hands held awkwardly together in front of him like those of an altar boy . He was tall and slender , handsome in a midwestern sort of way , with a fine jaw and long clean forehead , heavy eyebrows perched on top of gentle brown eyes . His mouth was his mother 's mouth , feminine , a bit too full . But then , you know his face as well as I do . " Well , " Thomas Crane said . " Clearly the world waits for us . " He smiled and it was a wonderful smile , crooked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as quintessentially American . " There 's a group waiting inside , " said John Starke , his press secretary , who had tumbled out of the van after him , along with a nervous , overweight woman I did not recognize and two reporters , both clearly wishing they were still in bed . Crane squinted into the snow , pounding his gloves together , and you could feel his concentrated awareness of being out on this street on this morning in this town with the heart of a nation waiting to be won . There was a pink glow , a newly minted brightness to his cheeks that was more than the cold and it filled me with a faint sense of warmth . " We 've got a few minutes , " he said . " Let 's stay out here for a while . " There is so much about him I have learned from others over the last year . There are scenes where I was not present that I now see as clearly as if I had been sitting in the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about things , too many days free to wander backward into the past , too much regret . But this first meeting was before all of that , and what I remember is the odd contrast between the stray melancholy that floated in the back of his eyes and the rest of his manner . Waiting on the sidewalk , he seemed the very model of the confident young politician , and yet there was this disconnection , this brief trace of something else when he let his gaze wander . I thought then it might be a kind of boredom , a reflection of an arrogance to which politicians are particularly susceptible , a conviction that any part of the universe not revolving intimately around their particular star is a lifeless void . Those eyes , however , slipped back into focus as he saw the first voter of the day approaching : a woman in a Scotch-plaid hat dragging a dog dressed in a matching sweater through the snow . He crossed the sidewalk to shake her hand . " I 'm Thomas Crane , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled and held the rat-eared dog up for inspection . " A handsome dog , " he said , " but I 'm not going to kiss him . " " Hold him , " she said , offering the terrier into his hands . With a wry smile he let her place the dog in his arms . " Tickle him on the tummy , " she said . " He loves that so . " He tried to oblige . " No , a little to the left . There . Now behind the ears . Down at the base . Yes . Okay . Now back to his tummy again . " Other people were out on the street now and they stopped to see what Crane was doing . He scratched dutifully and the dog 's head rolled back , his rear end squirmed . A small crowd gathered , dressed in the mufflers , stocking caps and goose-down parkas of New England . They peered over each other 's shoulders to see what creature was cradled in Crane 's arms . The moment froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in protectively , instructing with a sharply pointed finger . " Now the top of the nose , with a couple fingers . " He rubbed the nose awkwardly ; the dog stared cross-eyed at his fingers . " You did hear I 'm running for president ? " Crane said . " And then right under the chin . That 's right . " Crane patted tangled hair . Someone giggled . " There , Snoogems , you 're being petted by a man who might be the next president . Is n't that nice ? There , there , darling , he 's doing his best . You 're doing your best , are n't you ? A little bit more to the right , I think . " A southern voice drawled in my ear , " Roll over , Senator . " " What do you think , Snoogems ? " the woman asked . " Should I vote for the man ? Maybe , you say ? " " Why maybe ? " Crane asked the dog . The woman smiled and took Snoogems out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one on TV who promises to knock the hell out of the Japanese in the trade talks . But he thinks you 're a nice man . " Straight-backed and happy , she strolled on down the sidewalk . Snoogems gave Crane a last , lovesick look , then trotted obediently at the end of his leash . " Ohh , play dead , Senator , " the voice whispered . Crane stared at his hand , covered with terrier hair , as if searching for some explanation . Another giggle escaped from the back , but the crowd watched him in its quiet New England way , waiting for the clever thing he would surely say next . " Folks , come on into the diner with us , " Starke said quickly . " We 're going to have a cup of coffee , talk about the issues . Join us . We 'll even buy the coffee . " Inside , the smell of frying eggs , sausage , bacon and hash browns filled the air . A handful of men were bent over heavy porcelain mugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged with a fresh smile on his face . That is the thing about politicsevery encounter is a new chance to be loved . He worked his way down the counter slowly , listening carefully , knowing when to touch a shoulder , when to laugh . He reached a pale , long-haired man wearing a baseball cap tipped back on his head and a green down vest over a denim workshirt . The man told Crane he was a welder who worked at the bus factory on the edge of town . " But I lost my job last summer , after working my ass off for that company for seven years . What can you do for me ? " Crane sat down on the next stool . " I 've got an eight-point economic plan " The welder cut him off . " That 's very nice , but that could take years . I mean , you would n't be elected until next year and then , who knows . What I want to know is what can you do for me now ? " Crane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get elected first , " he confessed . The welder stared into his coffee cup in disappointment . " Sure . " The drawl in my ear earlier had come from a tall , thin southern aristocrat employed by the New York Times . His graying hair was a bit unkempt in the morning and his skin a sallower yellow than normal , but his voice had not lost its icy , bitter tang . " Ah , the can-do spirit of America . " It was my first day on the campaign trail , and I had arrived dreaming all the usual dreams . Now , here I was , in a sour little coffee shop on a cold morning , with the smell of dog hanging over the man who would be the leader of the free world , in a country where people want things now , right now . A presidential administration glimmered like the ocean down a desert highway and disappeared . Inaugural speeches and State of the Union addresses crumpled and blew away . Entire cabinets fell back into their graves . Crane sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there had to be something more , some glimmer of hope he had missed . The scene seemed to pain him in a way that I took again for a form of disbelieving arrogance . A commotion turned his head . A shaved skull flew through the door like a bullet . The man beneath it landed on his knees and then scrambled back to his feet , shouting at the top of his lungs , shouting that Crane hated gays because he had not backed a certain bill . A half dozen ACT-UP members tumbled through the door behind him . They began a frenzied , hoarse chant that filled the diner . Their coats fell like cloaks ; one of them was carrying two pieces of rough wood ; one was wearing a robe ; he stretched his arms out and they tied the lumber to his arms and down his back , a cross . A crown of thorns appeared from somewhere . The chant had changed . Kill us , Kill us , Kill us , it went . The words were so hoarse they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized they thought television was going to be here . They had been misinformed . For a moment Crane seemed paralyzed . He stood warily , his hands out , a sign of peace , asking for quiet . The chant continued , but changed again , Act up ! Act up ! Act up ! Their shout had the mindless fury , the desperate assertion , of a dying scream . Crane tried again for silence . The chant only intensified . Finally , he turned to the rest of the room and shrugged his shoulders . He headed for the door . Scattered applause , intended to show support , arose from the diner 's patrons . The protesters followed him outside , but his car was waiting . It was time for his next engagement anyway . Before leaving , he paused by the open door and surveyed the protesters as if they were raw fish laid out in a supermarket stall . He lifted his fine chin and shook his head sadly . We ended that night at a meeting with the strikers at a shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dozen men , worn and creased and drained of color , waited beneath a tarpaulin stretched between four poles . A trickle of water ran off the back and beneath their boots into a greasy puddle shivering with muddy light . They 'd been on the line for thirty days , marching back and forth in front of a low brick factory blackened decades ago , the sole survivor in a dinosaur park of rusting iron skeletons and sagging brick carcasses sinking in a field of ash . He joined them , shook hands and began to speak . He talked about the plans he had to provide tax credits for business modernization . He talked about his plans to retrain workers in dying industries . He spoke about the need to believe that things could be better . The need to believe we could change the course of our lives together . He was earnest and confident and they stared at him out of the death throes of American industry and after a time it was as if they had slid underwater and were watching him through drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark with the sleet falling down our backs when I ended up beside him . You could feel the whole bone-wearying slog of the day in his every step . He did n't say anything for a while . Then a smile curled up one side of his mouth , and he raised his head and fixed me with a sideways glance that had in it a stubborn refusal to go down , a strange and imperishable joy at where he had arrived in his life . " I do n't care what that woman says , " he said . " I still think I got that dog 's vote . " If this is a story about multiple seductions , about the delicate tide of faith on which we rise and fall , then it begins here . Because I confess I was a little bit gone on him from that moment on .
