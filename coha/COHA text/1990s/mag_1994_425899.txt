Section : STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS How Todd Holmes and Louis Amoroso turned a barroom conversation into a $16 million business . <p> ONE SUMMER EVENING three years ago a couple of 24-year-old pals , Todd Holmes and Louis Amoroso , were quaffing beer in Chicago 's City Tavern and bitching about their jobs . A common enough scene . <p> But this was different . They actually did something about it . Holmes was a commercial real estate salesman , Amoroso a computer consultant at Andersen Consulting . Instead of staggering home and nursing hangovers , they went into business . <p> This year their Beer Across America Inc. , which grew out of that 1991 conversation , will probably bring in $16 million , earning $3.5 million pretax . It 's a sort of book-of-the-month club for beer , shipping monthly beer rations from obscure little breweries from around the country . There 's Catamount , from White River Junction , Vt. ; Rogue , from Newport , Ore. ; Wild Bill 's Pumpkin Ale , from Hayward , Calif. ; Outrageous Bock , from Oldenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  regional outfits that produce fewer than 15,000 barrels of beer a year  --  are all the rage . Since 1988 , overall beer consumption has been flat , but the combined volume of the 460 U.S. microbrewers has grown an average of 46% a year , to 564,000 barrels last year . ( That 's about two days ' production for Anheuser-Busch . ) <p> The idea for Beer Across America emerged about three beers into the evening , when Holmes mentioned a friend who worked at San Juan Brewing Co. , a microbrewer in Telluride , Colo . It was a typical barroom conversation , and Amoroso mentioned the success of a local wine-of-the-month club . Recalls Holmes : I said beer , ' and Lou said , We can do this . ' ' <p> Calling around to a few microbreweries , they discovered that while there were over a dozen wine-of-the-month clubs , no one had yet done the same with beer . Putting up $10,000 each , they designed a sales brochure , bought a partial list of subscribers to Chicago magazine , hired an 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test mailing in time for the holidays . Pfft ! Of 2,000 pieces sent out , only 20 came back . <p> With little left to lose , they spent their remaining cash , $3,000 , on an ad in the December 1991 issue of Chicago . They also went door to door in neighborhoods where young people congregated , dropping off fliers in the lobbies of apartment buildings . This worked better : 480 orders at $15 each . In January 1992 they shipped out 480 six-packs each of Geary 's Pale Ale and Harpoon Golden Lager , generating over $7,000 in revenues  --  enough to pay the beer bills and put together another promotion . <p> Membership ' in the Beer Across America club costs $15 a month , plus tax and shipping . In return , members receive two six-packs of hard-to-find microbrews . Monthly shipments are automatically billed to credit cards and continue until the membership is canceled . <p> By targeting their mailings to groups like the 185,000-member Beer Drinkers of America and generating lots of publicity in local newspapers and on television news , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with revenues at $30,000 a month , they quit their regular jobs . Our friends thought we were wacky , ' says Amoroso , who designed a computer system and wrote the software to control the business . To help make ends meet , Holmes worked as a bartender on weekends . <p> Slowly , they honed their marketing skills , finding that direct response radio worked best . In late 1992 they shelled out $75,000 to buy time on rock and news-talk stations in Chicago , Los Angeles and San Francisco . Since 60% of their sales are gifts , they pitched their wares with lines like What are you going to do , buy him another ugly sweater this year ? ' By the end of the year , membership in Beer Across America hit 14,000 , sales $631,000 , pretax profits $71,000 . <p> Growth brought leverage with microbrewers , allowing Beer Across America to demand bigger discounts ; the average price it pays per six-pack has fallen to $3 from around $4 . <p> Growth also brought new challenges . A lot of little brewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Beer Across America takes on the brew , that means 30,000 cases . So Holmes and Amoroso sometimes have to contract out a microbrewer 's recipe to a larger brewer to get the quantities they need . <p> As with any business of this sort , the big profit is in customer loyalty  --  renewals . With an average acquisition cost of $25 , a new customer does n't turn a profit for Beer Across America until the fifth month of membership . Right now members are staying with the company for an average of nine months . Every month they can push that up means a big jump in profit margin . <p> Gearing up for the holiday selling season , Beer Across America has booked $1.5 million worth of radio time this fall  --  some of that going to the Howard Stern show , which is broadcast in 18 cities around the country . Now the company is diversifying into wine and coffee . With the new lines , Holmes and Amoroso figure they can push sales to $35 million in 1995 . <p> Earlier this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offer of $20 million for the company . Travis Green , president of Green , Morris &; Associates , a small investment banking firm in Atlanta , made the offer . Says Green : It 's one of the few businesses where your cash is up front , before you perform . And these young guys have managed their resources well . ' <p> Any regrets about not taking the $20 million ? None , ' says Holmes with the arrogance of youth and the wisdom of a seasoned entrepreneur . We 're only 27 , and we 've created a whole new market . ' <p> PHOTOS : Beer Across America founders Todd Holmes and Louis Amoroso : Sell out for $20 million ? Not on your life .
