She was on a beach in Florida , strolling on a hot , muggy night in October . Her coach was nowhere in sight , but Michelle Kwan still had only one thing on her mind : skating . Very quickly she transformed the soft sand into an accomplice to ice . First , she turned one foot on its side and walked on it for a minute , then she switched to the other foot and did the same . There was a reason for the bizarre exercise , she explained to TIME . " Sometimes when you do n't land a jump properly , even if you 're a little crooked , you can still have cat feet and land and be stable  --  if you have strong ankles . " And foot by foot , ankle by ankle , against the sand of Daytona Beach , she worked up her strength . <P> Out of such earthbound perseverance has emerged an amazing grace , with no trace of strain , as Kwan last month won the U.S. national title and the honor of leading America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a victory that gave no evidence of the pain that shoots through her left foot when she lands one of those seemingly effortless triple jumps . The only expression on her face was that beatific smile , won by defiance of every sort of gravity , not just the earth 's but the body 's and the mind 's as well , dangerous forces that can not just bring a skater down but keep her down too . At the Winter Games in Nagano , Kwan will be joined on Team U.S.A. by two others who can smile in the face of gravity and adversity : Tara Lipinski and Nicole Bobek . All have been national champions . And , yes , they are all veterans , even Lipinski at 15 , of juggling skating careers with public adoration , of living life on the edge of a blade and calculating victory or defeat in the split second it takes to leap from the ice . Do n't let the sequins and lace and the perfect coifs fool you ; these ice princesses could kick a hole in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> She has overcome fall after fall , and the memory of those falls , with the iron will to fly . Kwan skates three 45-min. sessions each day and sets goals for herself at each practice , devoting one session to the combination spin , improving the speed of the whirl and smoothing out the changes in direction , and another session to a jump . Kwan admits that when she has a " bad skate , " her coach Frank Carroll will say , " It 's O.K. " But , she says , " I tell myself , ' You 're not getting off the ice . ' He knows I torture myself and put myself through all kinds of tasks . " It was the punishing workouts that last November caused a months-old stress fracture in her left foot to become so painful that Kwan could not walk , let alone skate . She had to wear a cast for two weeks . As the nationals approached last month , Kwan still had not resumed her full training schedule . After a particularly frustrating practice session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happening to me ? " And if physical pain was a burden , the psychological stresses were even graver . Self-doubt can never be truly exorcised , and on the eve of what would be a remarkable reconquest of the national title , Kwan was anxious . " I was n't skating the greatest , " she said . " I think I did one clean long program before the competition , and I thought , ' How am I going to do it if I have n't done so many clean longs ? ' "
