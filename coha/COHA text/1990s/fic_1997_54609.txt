I am not ashamed to admit that I like being held with my back to her  --  her hands on my stomach , arms arrowing down my hips , fingers tracing the slightest underside of my jeans . I am not ashamed to admit that the absence of a face , the surprise of not being able to see , to predict motion , to prepare , is a charge . Eyes closed , leaning backward , her body 's bracing hold . When she touches me like that , she could be anyone and we could be anywhere . And yet she is not anyone , and we are in the living room or just inside the bedroom doorway or at the bathroom sink , and I have just finished brushing my teeth . I 'm dropping my toothbrush back into the porcelain holder ; I 'm recapping the toothpaste and thinking I 'll risk the ire of the dental hygienist by not flossing again , and her hand is on the small of my back . She could be anyone and she is not anyone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will find our way to the bed , trip over our shoes , and ruin ourselves for the morning . <p> We have been married seven years , and I cling to these erotic moments , make them larger events than they probably are , because it 's the little things that save us . Last week I stood at the stove and heated up Chinese food , dumping white containers of rice into kung pao chicken . Our son sat at the kitchen table , his fingers working crayons deep into a coloring book . He sang a song , too , and his endless verbal stream matched his chaos on the page . Claire rested her chin on my shoulder and peered into the pan . " Looks good , " she said , and ran her toe along my calf . It was only a second , an instant , a briefer time that it takes even to remember , but it was important . I know it was because sometimes when I least expect it , when I 'm hunting for my car in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , my body tightens for no reason at all . It 's her touch . I know . The imprint of a fingertip , a big toe , the bone in her ankle . She 's left traces on me , and they surface when I 'm not ready , and this is how I know things are n't so bad . <p> It 's not even that things are so bad , really . We 're just a little bored is what I keep telling myself . All my friends who would know and even my parents have told me that it 's the first ten years which are the hardest . You make it through those , they say , and it 's smooth sailing the rest of the way . Even if they 're just telling me these things to make me feel better , I 'm grateful . We 're not having such a hard time . We have n't asked for shrink referrals or anything . <p> David is five . He 's just started kindergarten , and he has Claire 's green eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Claire could stand to be touched again , we looked for moments to steal . I 'd wake up in the middle of the night to check on him , and Claire would tiptoe in behind me . When he stopped crying , we put him back beneath his covers and kissed under the paper-airplane mobile hanging from the ceiling . I 'd whisper to him , to his unreadable and unflinching gaze , " i 'm kissing Mommy ... Uhhuh , I 'm kissing your more . " <p> For the past three weeks , we 've been driving out to the country . Claire holds the classified section of the Sunday paper in her lap , and we try to find all the chocolate Lab breeders she has highlighted with a pink marker . David has a name already  --  Josie  --  so now it 's just a matter of finding the right one . When we look at the puppies , David handles each one , getting down on the ground with them , harking right back at them , living out a fantasy life that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more surprised by his pickiness than Claire or I , and they do their best to convince him he has found the right dog . " Oh boy , " they say , " looks like she really likes you , " or " She 'll follow you right home , probably just jump right into the car behind you . " But David has n't found the one he wants , and we do n't press him . <p> l enjoy our drives into the country , the car dipping and sailing along tree-sheltered streets with names like Ridge Road or Golden Brook Avenue . Dappled sunlight streams into the car and yellows Claire 's profile . Hair as fine as dust emerges along her earlobe . All three of us are mesmerized , and occasionally she lays her hand on my thigh , not even squeezing , really , just resting there . I acknowledge her gesture with one of my own , covering her fingers for a second , telling her I 'm there , before returning my hand to the steering wheel . Often we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dilapidated farmhouse , or someone checking mail at the end of a long driveway . But we are connected , our hands tell us that , and to look at each other would only be redundant . <p> There are vegetable stands , too , with hand-painted signs advertising Silver Queen corn and cukes and new potatoes . Claire 's favorites are the ones with fresh herbs , and we stop at these , and she holds the baggies of basil , thyme , and sage up to my nose and says , " Breathe . " At home she sprinkles the herbs over a chicken and surrounds it with potatoes . We eat things which have been in the dirt only hours ago . They 're pure , I think , and eating such fresh food is like an act of cleansing . <p> Our goal was to have the puppy by Halloween , but we have failed . David hardly notices because he is so preoccupied with the holiday . He announced weeks ago that he would be trick-or-treating as a Power Ranger , and ever since Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store within a fifty-mile radius . She told me that she 'd return home from each store and try to interest David in another costume , promising him that I would bring home some law volumes from the office and we 'd dress him in a three-piece suit and he could go as a lawyer , just like Daddy . Or Michael Jordan , David 's favorite sports hero . She called all her friends , too , to check what their children were going as . But everyone wanted Power Ranger costumes , and no one knew where to find them . <p> Last year he went as a Ninja Turtle , but when we suggested this costume David frowned at us . <p> " I 'm sure we still have it , " Claire said . <p> " I think it 's just down in the basement , " I added . <p> David scoffed at the idea , telling us , " Everyone knows Ninja Turtles are n't cool anymore . " <p> I tried to help out in the search , using time between meetings to finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut me off before I even finished the sentence . <p> " Hello , I 'm calling to see if you have any Power  --  " <p> " No , sir , clean out . You 're not going to find those anywhere . " <p> I heard stories of fights in the aisles , mothers punching one another . One manager told me about the two women who each grabbed a leg and would n't let go . They ended up ripping the costume in two exact halves . " Now look what you 've done , " one said . " It 's no good to either of us . " And then , this was what really amazed the manager , the other mother said , " Well , I 'm just glad your kid wo n't get to wear it . " <p> At night , with David at a friend 's house , Claire and I drove to the stores anyway and roamed the aisles of Toys " R " Us and Child World . We stared at the sky-high shelves , our senses assaulted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racetracks , play lawn mowers , more Legos than anyone could possibly ever need . You could probably build a whole other world with all those Legos , a green and red plastic replica of our own . Even after we knew there were no costumes , after we had seen the empty space in the shelf and traded tales of frustration with other parents , we continued on in a kind of trance . Like tourists , we gawked and paused by any particularly amazing display , as if it were a historical marker , or a famous painting . Claire even dipped a finger in the sample of neon-green edible slime . She tried to make me taste it , too , but I declined . <p> We love our son , but we wondered if we really needed to he contributing to all of this . It was just too much  --  too many toys , too much color , too much everything . In the parking lot we noticed the stars and the mist . Despite the infinite rows of cars , the sky stopped us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rundown farmhouse we 'd renovate , hammering and stripping and painting , dirtying old jeans , raising calluses on our hands , hard work we 'd wear on our bodies . David could find excitement in living things  --  the metronomic crickets , or the improbably loud call of bullfrogs in a pond behind the house . We could have three dogs , and they 'd have the run of our acres , and each of us would name one . Mine would be called Gus . David might miss the mall and the multiplex , but we 'd stock our pond , and I 'd take him fishing , and we 'd cast our lines and reel in something for dinner . Undoubtedly we 're not the first ones to dream of escape , but it did n't matter . Our lack of originality did n't make the fantasy any less appealing . <p> The week before Halloween , just when it was seeming hopeless and Claire had begun watching the Power Rangers TV show over David 's shoulder , trying to memorize hemlines and collar sizes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met with a new client . Claire had called that afternoon , before my meeting , and asked whether she should tell David she had sewn the costume herself or pretend it was from the store . Both of us agreed that things your mother made for you invariably were less cool than store-bought items , so we decided we would n't divulge the truth . <p> It never came to the lie . My new client worked for a toy distributor and in exchange for a slight discount in fees , he promised to " see what he could do . " That same night a UPS truck squeaked to a stop outside our house , and the brown-uniformed man left a box on the doorstep . When Claire and I went to retrieve the package , she whispered that she felt like taking a match to it . <p> When I arrived home Halloween night , there was a note from Claire that said she bad already taken David , before it got too dark . There was a chicken in the oven which I was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she always does  --  a hastily scrawled heart , a comma , and her name . But there was one difference . In parentheses , under her name , she had written , " We 'll talk later " <p> We had set that night aside for a talk . Not about any miscommunication or any such jargon , but a specific event . I had discovered recently , a week ago maybe , that before we were married , when Claire and I were dating , she had told her previous boyfriend to come to her apartment and act threatening . She engineered it so that we would be at her place  --  a railroad flat with hilly hardwood floors and a claw-foot tub in the kitchen-and he would demand to come in and speak to Claire . I would have to play the hero , and this would draw us closer . <p> We were on the sofa , falling asleep to the radio , when he started banging on the door . " Let me in " he yelled . " Claire , let me in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her whether he was ever violent , and she said no , but maybe if he got mad enough . " He can be sort of a live wire , " she said . I remember that she looked scared , and every time he shook the door handle and rattled the door , her body tensed . She was clutching the arm of the couch hard enough that her skin turned white . I opened the door and told him to leave . He tried to push past me , but I stayed my ground , blocking the way to Claire . I was ready for a fight , but it never came to that , and he backed away , swearing liquor-stained frustrations while he clomped down the stairs in his heavy boots . <p> When she told me it was all a plan , I was furious , in that silent way that words ca n't reveal . A kind of rage bubbled in me , knotting in my stomach , crawling just under my skin , and we lay in silence for a long time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter now , " she said . " What are you thinking ? she kept asking , and all I could say was that she had lied and that I did n't want to talk about it right then . I needed more time to think , I needed the morning to come . She made me set a date when we could settle it , saying she did n't want it living inside me like a tumor . " It does n't deserve that much attention , " she told me . " Let 's just have it out . " So we decided on Halloween , and I was able to forget about it , to not let it gnaw at me . I suppose I thought it about it still , but when you schedule something , it 's a way of shelving it , keeping it in view but not letting it rule your life . <p> Halloween night , I changed for dinner , laid my suit on the bed , searched for jeans and a T-shirt , and remembered last year 's holiday . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with a Post-it note that read , " Please take only one . " We had both taken David trick-or-treating , flanking him like bodyguards while we passed parades of angels , presidents , cowboys , football players . We traded conspiratorial smiles with the parents and reminded David not to drag his plastic pumpkin pail on the ground . There were ghosts , too , and witches and pirates , and I could n't help noticing David 's disdain for these simple costumes : a sheet with two holes for eyes , a black cape and hook nose , a hoop earring and an eye patch from the medical-supply pharmacy . <p> At each house , David said , " Trick or treat , " and was handed a piece of candy . He always said thank you , which made Claire and me proud , especially when we heard his quiet voice emerge from a passel of children elbowing each other to be first . Claire tried to look inside every house , check the furniture , glimpse the art hanging on the walls . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not that she 's jealous , she 's just curious . She cherished the chance to see what the other houses held , what lives hid behind the windows and stucco . I assume this is why she did n't complain this year when I told her I had a late meeting and she should go ahead with David . A couple times last year she lingered too long . David and I would arrive at the end of someone 's shrubs and notice she was not with us . We looked back , only to see her still on the porch , chatting with the unsuspecting host , trying to steal one last look . " Mommm , come on , " David would call , and she turned and walked toward us on the sidewalk , filing away the house in her mind . <p> For a few minutes , I wished that I had canceled my meeting and gone out with them . I sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed my weary eyes , picturing the two of them sharing moments , laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did n't want to talk . I wanted the whole thing settled , but I had no idea how we 'd get there . <p> The night before , we had spread newspaper over the kitchen floor and gutted a pumpkin , the largest one David could carry by himself . At the farm stands , when he kept pointing at the biggest pumpkins , we made a deal with him : if he could carry it , we 'd buy it . Somehow " carry " became merely " lift , " and we ended up with a pumpkin massive enough that David could brag , " We have the biggest jack-o ' - lantern on the block . " He had fidgeted all through dinner , urging us to hurry up and finish so we could carve the pumpkin . To satisfy him , we told him he could draw the face while we drank coffee , and so he used a black Magic Marker to sketch eyes , nose , and a mouth . Once we joined him on the floor , Claire guided his hand with hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David crinkled his nose in disgust while she removed handfuls of stringy interior . Later she separated out the seeds and roasted them on a cookie sheet . <p> After dinner , as we watched television , David fell asleep on Claire 's lap . I took him and rested his head on my shoulder and went upstairs to put him to bed . <p> " Daddy " he said , his voice struggling against sleep , " why did n't you help us make the jack-o ' - lantern ? " <p> I had sat with them , but I had watched . I had watched my wife empty the pumpkin , saw through the shaky outlines of David 's drawing , hold our son 's hand around the paring knife . Sometimes I forget that he has eyes . Not that they are a part of his anatomy , but that they see things , little things , and would have noticed me sitting to the side , holding a cup of coffee , offering advice , my knees barely touching the outermost sheet of newspaper covering the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told him , rubbing his back with my free hand . <p> I nudged his bedroom door open with my knee and stepped carefully around his strewn toys . I lifted him off my shoulder and drew the sheets over his small body , stopping for a moment to admire his innocent face , as settled and content as a lake . " Next year , Daddy " he said without opening his eyes . I was at the light switch by the door . I turned it off . " Next year you 'll help us , " he said through the darkness . <p> I think I started smelling burnt chicken skin at the same time as I heard Claire 's key in the front door . I rushed down toward the kitchen , taking the back stairs . The kitchen was already smoky . " Fuck , " I muttered and turned on the fan . <p> " Honey ? " Claire said from the front hall . Right on top of her greeting , with no tolerance for silence , David 's own excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> David had already dumped all his candy onto the living room rug and pushed it into a mountain . He used his foot to rake the carpet for stray candy bars . <p> " Wow , " I said , " look at your haul . " <p> He had flung his mask on the couch but still wore the silver pants and shirt and boots and gloves . " Dad , we only saw one other Power Ranger , and his costume was n't nearly as good as mine . " <p> " Someone else went the homemade route , I guess , " I said to Claire . <p> " All the true Rangers must be over in the Heights , " she said as she left the room . Silver candy wrappers glinted from the pile . I heard the oven door open and then shut . <p> " Honey , " Claire called . <p> The smell of burnt chicken grew stronger as I walked to the kitchen . Claire turned the fan to its highest setting , and I saw her face and arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove . She looked at me , her whole face a question . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said , looking down at the seared chicken . " Is any of it still okay ? " <p> Claire jabbed at it with a carving knife , and the crisp skin flaked off like confetti . " I do n't think so , " she said . She plunged the knife deep into the center . " Maybe down here , but it 's probably too dry " <p> For a moment both of us stared at the smoke tunneling upward . I took a fork and poked at the bird . The bottom of the pan was blackened , too , along with the potatoes . " I guess I was n't thinking , " I said , but Claire did n't respond . She just kept looking at me through the smoke . " l mean , I guess I was thinking about something else , " I said . I looked at my wife then and wondered if she regretted telling me the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David trick-or-treating , if it got in the way of her spying on other people 's houses . I saw the clock on the stove , and I wanted to turn it forward , make it one in the morning , turn off my study light and join her in bed , have her body move drowsily toward me , her toes brush my foot , her fingers settle on my stomach , watch her chest fill and relent . <p> " I guess we should order takeout , " I said . <p> Claire opened the drawer where we kept all the menus . She held them out like a fan . " Chinese , Indian , Thai ... We have n't had Thai in a while , " she said . <p> " How about pizza. ? " I said . <p> " Yeah , I want pizza , let 's get pizza . " David 's voice surprised both of us . We had n't noticed his entrance . " What smells ? " he asked . " Who burned something ? " <p> Claire started giggling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said and swung him onto my shoulders , feeling the shimmery material of his costume against my neck . " While you were out getting candy , Daddy burned the chicken so now we have to get pizza . " <p> " Daddy , I 'm glad you wrecked dinner , " David said . <p> " And why is that ? " I asked , though I knew . <p> " Because I love pizza . Can we get pepperoni ? " <p> Through the last remaining wisps of smoke , I saw Claire pick up the phone . She ordered and took one more look at the ruined chicken before dumping it into the trash . <p> After we called for the pizza , there was a series of false alarms . Each time the doorbell rang , David ran to the door , only to be disappointed because it was another trick-or-treater . He lost interest rapidly in the costumes , and it made me think that hunger is as powerful as anything . When a woman with a live snake draped around her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , asked whether it was poisonous , and tossed a Snickers bar into her bag . <p> I was hoping the pizza would never come because I knew that after that there were no more distractions , nothing more to put off my talk with Claire . Several times , as we opened the door for more werewolves and movie stars , I thought of saying to her , " Fuck it , let 's just forget about it . " But I did n't want to forget it . Or I could n't forget it . i wanted an explanation . <p> We ate in the living room , with plates balanced on our laps and beers on the coffee table , sweating rings on the glass surface . David sat on the floor , planted in front of the television , The Lion King humming along in the VCR for the umpteenth time . The heap of candy remained on the floor like some crazy altar . <p> " Is there any more beer ? " I asked . <p> " In the kitchen , " Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> I dropped the empties in the trash , watching them rest on top of the charred dinner . The room still smelled like smoke , and I cracked one of the windows . I grabbed two beers from the fridge , took a deep breath , and went back into the living room . <p> David had climbed onto the couch and into Claire 's lap , nestled there perfectly , like a puzzle piece . She sifted her fingers through his soft brown hair , coaxing his eyes shut , occasionally resting her lips on the top of his head . She listened to his intermittent memories of the evening . " Remember the clown man ? ... He had a cherry for a nose ... Godzilla was my second favorite ... " She was daring me , asking , Do you want to shatter this ? <p> " Maybe I should put him to bed , " I said . <p> " I 'll do it , " Claire said without taking her eyes off of him . She stood and laid a hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head did n't fall when he was an infant . " Why do n't you see if there 's a movie on or something ? " she said . <p> I looked through the TV guide while Claire climbed the stairs and readied David for bed . I heard him protest brushing his teeth , and then her gentle insistence . Their voices drizzled down the stairs like leaves , floating and slicing in the air , coming to rest , finding their own places . " Come on , sweetie , you promised me " she said . <p> The pipes went to work , and I knew that the bathroom faucet had just been turned on . I took a long pull of beer and then another . We do n't usually drink during the week , and the derailed routine felt like we were getting away with something . While Claire took lazy steps down the stairway , I finished the last bit of my beer and went to the kitchen for another . <p> She caught me staring at the chicken again . " It 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> " I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm a little preoccupied . " I felt warm from the beer , and I wanted Claire to feel warm , too . I handed her a cold bottle . <p> " Thanks . " She took my hand and led me back to the living room . " Did you find anything ? " she asked , her eyes motioning toward the television . <p> " Oh . No , " I said . I sat down next to her on the couch . Claire finished the pizza on her plate and watched me watch her eat . The silence in the room reminded me of an awkward date , and I again wanted to set time ahead , slide the night into the past . We 'd fall asleep to a lush breeze and wake to the heat of the sun , and nothing and everything would be the same , nothing and everything would matter . <p> The silence tugged at Claire , too , and she went to the stereo and slid an A1 Green record from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop as the needle stuttered toward the first song . It was one of those times when the world is waiting for you to say something . Rain suspends . Every traffic light is red . Claire carne back to the couch and sat in the opposite corner . She picked at the corner of the beer label and studied the nearly empty pizza box , strands of cheese lining the bottom like wax . <p> " Mommy .. ? ' We heard David 's voice from the top of the stairs . " Will you come up and read me a story ? " <p> I looked at Claire and started to get off the couch , but she shook her head . " Go back to bed , " she called . " It 's late now . " <p> " But I hear something ... There 's something scary ? ' <p> Again I started to get up , but Claire palmed my knee and urged me back down . " There 's nothing in your room , sweetie , " she said . <p> " I checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " <p> " Yes , under the bed also . " <p> Both of our heads were cocked toward the ceiling . When we heard David 's pajama feet pad over the floor , we let our shoulders fall back into the cushions . I went to the stereo to turn up the volume and on the way back crunched something beneath my feet . I saw a pack of Sweet Tarts ground into the rug . Claire was giggling . " I wo n't tell if you wo n't " she said . <p> I crouched down and gathered the pink powder in my hands and rubbed them together over the pizza box , watching the dust coat the lone cold slice . " Look at all his candy , " I said . " This was one of a thousand . " <p> " I do n't know why you 're making such a big deal of this , " Claire said , and it took me a moment to realize what she was talking about . For a minute or so , I thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded to talk to her . I protected her , or thought I was protecting her . Told him to leave , held her tight when we went to bed , caressed her back , and told her everything would be okay . I thought I was the hero . Turns out I was the only one who did n't know what was going on . <p> Claire continued , " So I told Philip to come over , have liquor on his breath , act like an asshole . So what ? " She took a long swallow of beer . " Is it the end of the world ? " <p> " It was n't honest . " My bluntness surprised me . <p> " You 're being so moralistic . I was afraid you did n't like me enough . I was afraid you thought l was too independent , that I did n't need you , and I wanted to show you that was n't true . " She could n't stop herself . " I was so afraid you would leave me and not marry me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " <p> " It was n't meant as a trick . " She brushed a hair from her forehead . " What does it matter , anyway ? " <p> " It matters because you lied . " <p> " People are dishonest all the time . Just a minute ago we agreed that you would n't tell David you crushed his candy . What 's the difference ? " <p> " I do n't know , but there is one . " I felt buzzed from the beer . " You were dishonest , and it means the whole marriage is a lie . " <p> " God , you 're being ridiculous . That 's not what it was about , and you know it . It was n't about playing some trick on you for the hell of it . " <p> " Then what does it mean ? " <p> " It means I loved you a lot , and I was dying for you to ask me to marry you . " Claire stared at the darkened TV screen . " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it something else . " <p> " Loved ? " <p> " Yes , loved . I loved you so much that it hurt when you left the room even for a few seconds , like to use the bathroom . " <p> " So you do n't love me anymore ? " I was being a jerk , but I knew it , and somehow it made everything a little more bearable . <p> " Oh shit , Henry . Love , of course love . I did n't mean the past tense . " Claire got up with a huff and went to the stereo . She flipped the record and with her back to me started talking again . " You know , I 'm not going to apologize . " <p> " Why ? " <p> She turned to face me . " Because I do n't think I need to . It brought us closer . Is there anything wrong with that ? " <p> The doorbell rang , but neither of us made any motion to get it . A minute passed , and whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join them . I had been looking forward to Halloween , not this part but the earlier part . I remembered my own Halloweens , when my brother and I would empty all our candy onto the living room floor at the end of the night . Then we sorted it . And when we finished sorting , we traded  --  a Milky Way for a Three Musketeers , a Sky Bar for some candy corn  --  and this would continue until our father made us go to bed . <p> My mother warned us not to eat too much candy . " Remember your teeth , " she admonished . " They 're the only ones you 've got . " Every year she managed to schedule a dentist appointment the week before Halloween , and as we grew older , we began to recognize the logic behind what we had thought random coincidence . The dentist always ended the appointment with gruesome pictures of cavity-filled mouths , grotesque cartoons from a thin book called The Story of Yuck-Mouth . As if we needed anything more , Dr. Bennet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want you ending up like this fella . " <p> What my mother never realized was that I was a hoarder and not a binger , and I derived far more pleasure from keeping candy around as long as possible , some years until Christmas , than from stuffing my mouth full of treats . My brother and I had an informal competition about who could make his stash last longest . I rationed myself  --  one piece after school every other day , and two on the weekends  --  and ended up winning each year . Around the middle of November , I would lord my remaining candy over him , bartering Hershey bars for household chores . <p> Claire moved closer to me on the couch , leaving her corner and the pillow she held in her lap . I would n't look at her . She took my hand , and I could n't resist its insinuating warmth . " Are you still mad ? " she asked . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . And it was true , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't apologize for anything , that you should move on , not dredge up the past , and this extremism is one of the reasons I love her . It 's one of the things I idolize about her . " I 'm going to put another record on , " I said . But before I could get up , Claire grabbed my hand and clamped tight , both her hands around mine . <p> " Do n't move , " she said . " Let it repeat . Just sit here with me . " <p> For the first time since we started talking , I looked into her eyes and noticed the hazel flecks within the green and the nervous flutter of her eyelashes . " I 'll go get the rest of the beers , " she said , " and we 'll just stay and talk . " She turned my hand over and opened my palm and followed its lines with her ring finger . " You can tell me anything . " She brought my hand to her mouth , kissed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I nodded and watched her walk out of the living room . When she was out of sight , I followed her and joined her at the open fridge . She turned around to face me , but I swiveled her body and held her with her back to my chest . " Once , " I said to her ear , " I was purposely late for a movie so it would sell out and we 'd have to go to my apartment instead . " <p> She fished the last beers from the bottom shelf . We went back to the couch and laid down , her legs braiding mine . We drank beer and talked all night . We spilled our sins , handing each one out , dropping candy into bags . <p> <p> By ETHAN HAUSER <p>
