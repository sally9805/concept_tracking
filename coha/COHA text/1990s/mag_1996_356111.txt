Question : why would a guy worth $2 billion give a hoot about the sticker prices on most new cars ? Answer : By chopping them down a notch , maybe he can make $2 billion more . <P> Meet H. Wayne Huizenga , billionaire entrepreneur extraordinaire . No introduction is needed , really . Huizenga hauled away your trash twice a week in the 1970s , treated you to a cheap date with video rentals in the 1980s and sated your craving for first downs , slap shots and strikeouts as a sports tycoon in the 1990s . It is n't possible to be a conscious adult and not have contributed to the Huizenga stash in some small way . Now the man who built what has become waste-giant WMX Technologies , video-king Blockbuster Entertainment and perhaps the biggest collection of sports properties anywhere ( Miami Dolphins , Florida Panthers , Florida Marlins ) wants you to make another contribution . And  --  gulp  --  this time he 's thinking big . <P> These days Huizenga operates as chairman of a company called Republic Industries . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 . ) And his latest scheme promises to rock the very core of the car world , which is worth $1 trillion when viewed as a series of transactions that includes new- and used-car sales , service , accessories and financing . Car businesses compose one-seventh of the economy . <P> Huizenga wants to institutionalize the no-haggle car purchase , spruce up car lots , give unhappy buyers full refunds , offer used-car buyers decent warranties and generally make the car-buying experience easier to stomach . These are not new ideas , but Huizenga plans to carry them out on a scale that would literally transform every aspect of car retailing . This is a glimpse of Wayne 's Auto World , where the same formula that has revolutionized video and trash will be put to work on wheels . <P> The driver of Huizenga 's new plan is a chain of used-car superstores under the name AutoNation USA . In the next few weeks Republic will complete its purchase of AutoNation and be free to pursue Huizenga 's aggressive strategy . Republic is a diversified company with interests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once the company acquires AutoNation , is where it expects to get most of its growth . Investors are hitching a ride . Since Huizenga took over in May 1995 , Republic stock has rocketed from less than $2 to more than $30 , making Wayne $750 million richer on paper . <P> It 's widely known that Huizenga , 58 , expects to increase AutoNation 's current seven used-car lots to about 100 sprinkled around the U.S. by the turn of the century . What is n't widely appreciated , though , is how he hopes the used-car superstores  --  each planned to have 1,000 or more cars in stock , and each generating $100 million in annual revenue  --  will fit into his ultimate scheme . In Wayne 's world , you never get attached to cars . You trade them every couple of years until they 're scrap  --  and every stop along the way , he gets a piece of the action . <P> It all starts , naturally , with mint cars from the factory floor . And that is the piece to this giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on feverishly today . Huizenga , who built his trash and video empires via rapid acquisitions , will spend about $250 million next year to build used-car megalots from the ground up . But to complement that investment , he 's about to embark on a takeover spree of new-car dealerships .
