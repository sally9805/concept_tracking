If World Cup sportscasters snicker when they suggest a tiring player did not have " enough days off , " here 's why : two researchers in Israel have studied 36 male Israeli football players and have established the optimum period of sexual abstinence for peak athletic performance . Complicating life for coaches , athletes and their partners , the interlude varies with a player 's position on the field . Forwards , who expend extra energy and aggression , should refrain from sexual activity for six to eight days before a game . Defenders and goalies , who require less physical energy on the playing field , need only curtail bedroom sports three to five days before the kickoff . Alexander Olshanyetsky and Mordechai Halperin of the Jerusalem Center for Impotence and Infertility plan to expand their research to include more players and other sports . But no telling when they will turn to the question on the minds of players ' wives : What is the optimum period of abstinence from football for peak sexual performance ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
