Just having tickets has not been enough to get audiences into Harold Prince 's spectacular , 71-actor , $6.5 million staging of Show Boat at the opulent new North York Performing Arts Centre in suburban Toronto . It has also been necessary to pass in front of black hecklers shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT SPREADS LIES AND HATE and SHOW BOAT = CULTURAL GENOCIDE . The protest , under police guard , has not deterred many ticket holders but may have had a striking impact on potential sales : inside the theater , the only black faces readily apparent belong to ushers . As often happens when a work of art becomes a political symbol , those who denounce this Show Boat admit they have not seen it , and meanwhile their venom makes it uncomfortable for other members of the black community to judge for themselves . <P> Paradoxically , it turns out that for all the wrong reasons , the protesters are right . The 1927 musical is racist . The problem is not the epithet " niggers " in the opening song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which in any case has been expunged in favor of the less incendiary " colored folks . " Nor is it the historically accurate portrayal of blacks as mostly compliant , if resentful , field hands and laborers . The real problem is that the show follows the wrong story . It assumes that black people are inherently less interesting than whites . <P> The white clan of song-and-dance people who own the riverboat theater are a bland and predictable lot , living through formula heartaches : economic ups and downs , marital tussles , the twinges of age , dreams of what might have been . By contrast , the mulatto singer Julie , who passes for white , has a much more distinct and provocative situation . She is a leading lady desired by every man . The fellow actor who marries her knows and accepts her ethnic identity  --  a remarkable thing in the Deep South of the 1880s , yet never explored in the script . Her moments , superbly acted and sung by Lonette McKee , have an emotional power and tragic heft far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway through the first act , save for two fleeting glimpses later on . <P> This may well be as much attention to blacks as Broadway audiences would allow in 1927 , but today the narrative defects of Oscar Hammerstein II 's book are too glaring for Prince 's razzmatazz to overcome . At best the script is a faint and fractured ghost of Edna Ferber 's overstuffed novel . At worst it is a herky-jerky alternation of melodramatic vignettes yanked out of context and escapist bursts of clowning and dance . <P> Like so many show-business musicals since , Show Boat reserves its deepest passion for the stage itself , not the players who inhabit it . That may account for its enduring fascination among show people  --  five Broadway productions , three movies and a four-hour 1988 recording that includes minor bits of orchestration and songs dropped from the original . Director Prince and his co- creators acknowledge their backstage affinity , although they also cite the show 's literary significance as one of the first musicals to take on political subjects , integrate song and dance into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls Show Boat " the first great modern musical .
