Le Corbusier loved Manhattan . He loved its newness , he loved its Cartesian regularity , above all he loved its tall buildings . He had only one reservation , which he revealed on landing in New York City in 1935 . The next day , a headline in the Herald Tribune informed its readers that the celebrated architect FINDS AMERICAN SKYSCRAPERS MUCH TOO SMALL . Le Corbusier always thought big . He once proposed replacing a large part of the center of Paris with 18 sixty-story towers ; that made headlines too . <P> He was born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in Switzerland in 1887 . When he was 29 , he went to Paris , where he soon after adopted his maternal grandfather 's name , Le Corbusier , as his pseudonym . Jeanneret had been a small-town architect ; Le Corbusier was a visionary . He believed that architecture had lost its way . Art Nouveau , all curves and sinuous decorations , had burned itself out in a brilliant burst of exuberance ; the seductive Art Deco style promised to do the same . The Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the name implies , it was hardly representative of an industrial age . Le Corbusier maintained that this new age deserved a brand-new architecture . " We must start again from zero , " he proclaimed . <P> The new architecture came to be known as the International Style . Of its many partisans  --  among them Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany , Theo van Doesburg in Holland  --  none was better known than Le Corbusier . He was a tireless proselytizer , addressing the public in manifestos , pamphlets , exhibitions and his own magazine . He wrote books  --  dozens of them  --  on interior decoration , painting and architecture . They resembled instruction manuals . An example is his recipe for the International Style : raise the building on stilts , mix in a free-flowing floor plan , make the walls independent of the structure , add horizontal strip windows and top it off with a roof garden . But this makes him sound like a technician , and he was anything but . Although he dressed like a bureaucrat , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was really an artist ( he was an accomplished painter and sculptor ) . What is most memorable about the austere , white-walled villas that he built after World War I in and around Paris is their cool beauty and their airy sense of space . " A house is a machine for living in , " he wrote . The machines he admired most were ocean liners , and his architecture spoke of sun and wind and the sea . <P> By 1950 he had changed course , abandoning Purism , as he called it , for something more robust and sculptural . His spartan , lightweight architecture turned rustic , with heavy walls of brick and fieldstone and splashes of bright color . He discovered the potential of reinforced concrete and made it his own , leaving the material crudely unfinished , inside and out , the marks of wooden formwork plainly visible . Concrete allowed Le Corbusier to explore unusual shapes .

For the state capital of Chandigarh in India , he created a temple precinct of heroic structures that appear prehistoric .
