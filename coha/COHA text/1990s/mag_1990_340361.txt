" No mother believes her child is going to die , " cried Elizabeth Glaser . " But after two years of struggling , ( ( we ) ) had to face the reality that our daughter was going to die . " Those poignant words , spoken last week before the House Budget Committee , were intended to prod the Federal Government into spending more money on researching pediatric AIDS . The witness , wife of TV star Paul Michael Glaser ( Starsky and Hutch ) , had contracted the HIV virus from a blood transfusion nine years ago and passed it along to her infant daughter Ariel and son Jacob . Since Ariel 's death in 1988 , the Glasers have devoted much of their energies to publicizing the plight of AIDS-infected children . <P> No one could question the worthiness of the Glasers ' cause , the depth of their tragedy or the sincerity of their commitment . Yet their ability to generate headlines clearly resulted from Paul 's celebrity status . Were the Glasers manipulating press coverage ? Of course they were , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news reporting , however , are not always prompted by such laudatory aims . Professional publicity experts have made a multibillion- dollar industry out of copping column inches and airtime for everything / from smokers ' rights and rap records to haute couture and the Trump bust-up . And the White House has raised press manipulation to a virtual art form , often for the narrowest political motives . The Reagan Administration , led by the Great Persuader himself , was notorious for its spin control . Last week the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , a Washington-based watchdog group , issued a report detailing nearly 100 instances of news orchestration , press restrictions and disinformation by the Bush Administration . <P> Not that the reporter is always an acquiescent pawn : manipulation is a two- way street . In a series of New Yorker articles that was recently published in book form , writer Janet Malcolm argues that the journalist 's power to play God with a source 's life inevitably leads to treachery . She examines the case of best-selling author Joe McGinniss , who ingratiated himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a physician accused of brutally murdering his wife and children . But instead of writing the exculpatory tome that MacDonald had been led to expect , McGinniss produced a work of pitiless condemnation . Malcolm uses this example to argue that journalists are reprobates who hoodwink helpless patsies and publicly betray them . <P> Although few journalists aim to become intimate friends of homicidal psychopaths , most have felt ambivalent about the reporter-source liaison . That relationship is one in which loyalties are fragile , trust is withheld and manipulation by both the reporter ( who controls access to the mass public ) and the source ( who controls access to information ) is normal .
