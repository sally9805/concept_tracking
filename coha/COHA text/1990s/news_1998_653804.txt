<p> Cyberspace , only yesterday the proud Wild West of the information age , is rapidly being settled and tamed . The best evidence is a sudden  --  and some might say alarming  --  infestation by a new species , the cyberlawyers . <p> They seem to be everywhere . <p> Last month , at the Computers , Freedom and Privacy conference  --  an annual gathering once dominated by hackers and security agents  --  they clogged panels with subjects like " Government jurisdiction over cyberspace transactions . " <p> Each week , they post hundreds of messages to their own " Cyberia " E-mail list , pondering matters like " Usenet Death Penalty  --  Legal ? " And a pack of cyberlawyers are petitioning the White House for access to its planned conference on Internet privacy . <p> The nation 's top law schools are vying to dominate an area of jurisprudence called cyberlaw , while law firms promoting such practices are becoming as ubiquitous as spam E-mail . And court dockets are swelling with digital-age disputes of " first impression . " <p> Whatever happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the legal trade , res ipsa loquitur  --  the thing speaks for itself . <p> The Internet has changed from a playground for like-minded libertarians to a workplace and social space for millions . The latest wave of settlers has little interest in the cyberstate of nature or the utopian manifestoes of pioneers , like John Perry Barlow 's oft-cited " A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace , " which defied any state 's assertion of having control over the Internet . <p> That is where the lawyers come in . <p> " It 's like when you start a colony , " said Mike Godwin , chief counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , an advocacy group that only a few years ago was practically alone in the field . " The first thing you do is you find out where the water is . The next thing you do is form couples , start families . The notion of having law , which is a way to order social interactions , only happens after you have a lot of social interactions such that they become problematic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relies on analogy , even defining the nature of an Internet-related dispute can be a source of contention . <p> Consider just a few of the pending cases and the questions they raise across a range of legal doctrines : <p> *The United States Government sues the Microsoft Corporation , charging it with antitrust violations . How is monopoly measured in an information age ? <p> *A White House aide , Sidney Blumenthal , sues an Internet gossip columnist , Matt Drudge , for libel . What is the burden of proof and what are the remedies for libel on the Internet , where everyone can be a publisher ? Moreover , can Mr. Drudge be sued in the District of Columbia for an item that he posted on his World Wide Web site in Los Angeles ? <p> *America Online sues for an injunction against multiple distributors of junk E-mail . Is such " spam " mail a violation of privacy ? Would attempts to block it violate the First Amendment ? <p> *A mathematics professor is suing the United States Government for denying his application to send an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to prevent him on national security grounds , or would that violate his free-speech rights ? <p> Cindy Cohn , the lawyer representing the math professor , said it was in part the lure of the unknown that made cyberspace law so appealing . " It 's a chance to think about first-level questions , " said Ms. Cohn , a partner in the McGlashan &; Sarrail firm in San Mateo , Calif . " With nine-tenths of my other cases , the same issue has already been decided . With this , you can say maybe you need to think in a new way about it . " <p> Ms. Cohn is scheduled to testify tomorrow before a Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee on proposed encryption legislation . <p> Not everyone is as sanguine about the prospect of a clean legal slate . <p> What is at stake , legal experts say , is whether the values that evolved over two centuries of case law will apply in cyberspace  --  and what those decisions will teach us about the law in real space . <p> " There is anxiety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit court judge . Alluding to his role last year in overturning the Communications Decency Act , a landmark decision for cyberspace law that was later upheld by the Supreme Court , Judge Dalzell recalled : " I know going in that when I started to hear the testimony I went , ' Oh my God ! Oh my God ! I have to learn about packet switching ? ' And had we gone down the wrong path , it could have done immense mischief to the medium . " <p> As judges and lawyers search for metaphors , elite law schools are scurrying to stake their claims as the center of legal theory that will make sense of it all  --  and to lure cutting-edge law professors and attract students eager to enter what looks to be a lucrative new field of practice . <p> Earlier this month , Harvard Law School said it had received a $5.4 million donation from the estate of Jack N. Berkman , an alumnus , and his wife , Lillian R. Berkman to support its Center for Internet and Society , which was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director . <p> Professor Charles Nesson , the center 's director , said the money would be used in part to experiment with opening up the gates of the august institution to the general public . More than 1,000 people have enrolled in Privacy in Cyberspace , the center 's first free no-credit course offered over the Internet . <p> The gift will also endow a professorship . First to be named to the Berkman chair was Lawrence Lessig , whose appointment by a Federal district judge as special master in the Government 's antitrust case against Microsoft did much to raise the profile of the nascent field of cyberspace legal theory . ( Mr. Lessig 's investigation has been suspended pending an appeals court decision on the propriety of his appointment . ) <p> Not to be outdone , Harvard 's longtime rival , Yale Law School , made Mr. Lessig a standing job offer as part of its effort to jump-start its Information Society Project . The school has offered visiting professorships to two intellectual property experts : James A. Boyle from American University and Robert Mergess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of California . <p> " Yale is going to be the place to be for cyberlaw , " said Jack Balkin , director of the school 's program . " What happened at Yale is , nobody came to us and said , ' Here 's some money . Go found a technology center . ' This was something we identified as a priority . " <p> Yale 's stance is making other schools nervous . " The competition has definitely heated up , " said Pam Samuelson , who helped found Berkeley 's center two years ago and hopes that Mr. Mergess will stay put . <p> Ms. Samuelson , a leading critic of the Clinton Administration 's proposal to adapt copyright law to cyberspace , said Berkeley 's advantage was being in the midst of the industry that is creating so many of today 's legal challenges . <p> Ms. Samuelson said that centers like Berkeley 's would teach different skills and values than the traditional law school curriculum has taught . <p> " Rather than trying to develop fixed sets of black-letter law rules that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students learn to be supple and adaptable , " Ms. Samuelson said . <p> Although by most accounts Harvard , Yale and Berkeley have the strongest offerings , expertise in the field has spread . Michael Froomkin at the University of Miami has published several articles on law and cryptography , for example ; Dan L. Burk at Seton Hall University is an expert on jurisdictional issues in cyberspace . <p> David Post , co-founder of the Cyberspace Law Institute and now a professor at Temple University Law School , is at the center of an active debate among lawyers about whether the emergence of cyberspace requires a whole new legal model . <p> " There is a division between the incrementalists and the radicals , " Mr. Post said . " To me it makes more sense to think of this as a separate domain of interaction that 's going to have its own rules . " <p> The stress that the new technology places on existing law has provoked some scholars to argue that cyberspace needs laws of its own in areas like copyright and privacy . Others wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-line behavior by computer code , constitutional principles should regulate private as well as state action . <p> But many legal scholars scoff at the notion that cyberspace presents the need for a new discipline . Among them is Judge Frank Easterbrook of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and a professor at the University of Chicago . In an article for the University of Chicago Law Review titled " Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse , " Judge Easterbrook warned of " multidisciplinary dilettantism . " A law of cyberspace makes about as much sense as a law of horses , he said . <p> Still , even critics agree that the emergence of cyberspace is forcing the deepest and most critical consideration in years of law in general . <p> " Maybe dividing the world up into real space and cyberspace is artificial , " said Brian Dally , 26 , a student in Mr. Lessig 's cyberspace law class . " What really came rushing to the fore for me in this class is that this should give us pause to examine some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of law . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : March 23 , 1998 , Monday <p> CORRECTION : An article in Business Day last Monday about the emerging field of cyberspace law misidentified the publication that carried an article titled " Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse , " by Judge Frank Esterbrook of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , in which he argues against the idea that the Internet creates a need for a new legal discipline . The publication was the University of Chicago Legal Forum , not the University of Chicago Law Review . <p> Chart : " Digital Docket " Increasingly , the spread of computers and on-line interactions and transactions is creating new case law . Here is a sampling of the new kinds of cases and the legal fields affected . CRIMINAL LAW U.S. v. Thomas , 1996 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Federal criminal obscenity case . A California couple used e-mail and a modem to market and sell pornography . One customer was an undercover U.S. Postal Inspector in Tennessee . The court upheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their operation of an electronic bulletin board from California . CIVIL PROCEDURE/TRADEMARK Panavision Int'l , L.P. v. Toeppen , 1996 United States District Court , Central District of California An Illinois resident reserved Internet domain names , like Panavision , that were trademarks of well-known companies , then attempted to resell or license the domain names back to the trademark holders . The court held he could be sued in California for trademark infringement . TORTS Cubby , Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. , 1991 U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York Cubby claimed that it was defamed by a newsletter published by a third-party but carried on CompuServe and that CompuServe was liable because it had republished the work . The court found that CompuServe had little editorial control over the publication and was more like a book store or public library and thus was not liable for damages . CONSTITUTIONAL LAW Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union , 1997 United States Supreme Court The Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional , on First Amendment grounds , provisions of the Communications Decency Act that criminalized the knowing transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions prohibiting such transmissions were in violation of the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech .
