It was fun last summer and early fall to watch the two brightest planets  --  Venus and Jupiter  --  edge closer together on the dome of the evening sky . By Halloween , both planets were so near the Sun along our line or sight that they were difficult or impossible to see . Venus passed between us and the Sun on November 2 , and Jupiter passed behind the Sun on November 17 . Then as always Earth moved on in its orbit around the Sun , bringing Jupiter back into view before dawn . Meanwhile , Venus fled ahead of us in its smaller , faster orbit . Now at greatest elongation it 's also up before the Sun . On January 13 , Venus ' distance from the Sun is 47deg , and Venus and Jupiter lie just 3deg apart . They are beacons in the predawn sky , a double whammy of brilliance , outshining all the stars . At greatest elongation , Venus shines at magnitude - 4.4 . Around the middle of January , it appears through a telescope to be half illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The disk of Venus measures about 25 " this month and will shrink in the coming months as the planet continues to speed along ahead of us in orbit . This month Jupiter shines at magnitude - 1.9 . As the largest planet in the solar system , it always looms large through the eyepiece of a telescope . Now its disk measures nearly 33 " even though it is on the far side of the solar system from Earth . Perhaps some dark crash spots created in the spectacular impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 last summer will remain visible . The bright star Spica lies above Venus and Jupiter in the predawn sky . Be sure to watch on January 23 , when the Moon sweeps only 0.6deg north of Spica . Yet another bright star  --  Antares in the constellation Scorpius  --  lies below Venus and Jupiter this month . Venus passes 8deg north of Antares on January 15 , while Jupiter passes 5deg north of Antares on January 22 . The scorpion comes out of the dawn with its tail arcing toward the horizon . You probably ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see three little stars in a smaller arc above Antares . These stars are called " the crown of the Scorpion . " It is interesting to watch the fixed pattern of the scorpion ascend in the predawn sky , while Venus and Jupiter pursue their individual paths on our sky 's dome . Their separate motions stem solely from the fact that they are millions of times closer to us than the stars . Finally , watch late in the month as the closest planetary body of all , our companion Moon , sweeps past the morning planets . Jupiter lies 1.7deg south of the Moon on January 26 . Venus is 0.2deg south of the Moon on January 27 . From Central America on the 27th , the Moon passes in front of the bright planet , blocking it from view . Meanwhile , in the evening sky , reddish Mars grows brighter and appears for more hours of the night as it gets closer to its February opposition . By mid-January it comes over the eastern horizon about three hours after sunset , nearly at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closest to us on February 11 , one day before it is directly opposite the Sun . Mars now lies in Leo . While it 's easy to notice that the planets Venus and Jupiter are moving against the starry backdrop , a similar motion for Mars is not so easy to discern . That is because this month Mars reaches its " stationary " point , where it stops moving in its usual eastward direction and begins to edge west . Between these two motions , Mars hangs motionless in front of the stars . Its stationary point comes on January 3 . The westward or " retrograde " motion of Mars baffled the ancients , but it occurs whenever Earth goes between any outer planet and the Sun . The Quadrantid meteors , which always peak in early January , radiate from a region of the heavens that used to be called Quadrans Muralis . The constellation of the " wall quadrant " is now divided between Bootes , Hercules , and Draco . The Quadrantid shower is not easy to observe , however , because it produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at most . In recent years , some observers in exactly the right place on Earth at the right time have reported rich displays of Quadrantids . This year the Moon is out of the way . Comet Borrelly 's opposition comes on the 20th . Be sure to turn your binoculars in its direction . Another member of our Sun 's family comes to opposition on January 2 . When you search for the asteroid 654 Zelinda , remember that there will be no telltale cometlike fuzziness to give its identity away . The asteroids  --  whose name means " starlike "  --  can be told apart from stars only by their motion against the star background . January 's Planets Uranus and Neptune both lie close to the speedy trek of Mercury this month . All three planets are in the western sky after sunset , but when the conjunctions occur all three are too low in the sky to be visible . Mercury is 3deg south of Neptune on January 1 . It is 1.7deg south of Uranus on January 3 . Uranus and Neptune then go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune is in conjunction with the Sun on January 13 . Uranus is in conjunction with the Sun on January 17 . They 'll both return to the predawn sky in February . Mercury ascends higher in the evening twilight sky to reach greatest elongation  --  its farthest point from the Sun in the sky  --  on January 19 . Then the innermost planet is 19deg east of the Sun and visible as a surprisingly bright object low in the west-southwest 45 minutes after sunset . Saturn , in Aquarius , is also in the west after sunset . This planet sets about three hours after sunset in early January , but by the end of the month it follows the Sun below the horizon by only about an hour . Saturn has now dimmed to magnitude 1.0 because it 's nearly behind the Sun as seen from Earth . It 'll pass behind the Sun in early March . The time for viewing Saturn through a telescope ends this month , so take one last peek . The planet is already so low in the sky that you 're seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rings now appear nearly edgewise from our earthly vantage point . In May , they 'll be precisely edge-on to Earth , at which time the broad and glorious rings of Saturn will seem to disappear . Mars comes up in mid-evening when the month begins and by the end of the month can be found soon after true darkness falls . This planet is now moving toward its February opposition , when Earth will pass between Mars and the Sun . Mars can be very inconspicuous when it is on the far side of the Sun from us , but it 's shining brightly now at magnitude - 0.5 . Pluto is up several hours before the Sun now . It is about a thousand times too faint to see with the eye alone . Venus reaches greatest elongation on January 13 . It is 47deg west of the Sun , a brilliant object in the east before dawn . Jupiter is below Venus when the month begins and above it in the predawn sky by the month 's end . Mars Gets Big and Bright Mars has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , keeping to the morning sky and remaining fairly inconspicuous . But beginning this month the Red planet begins to take center stage . In fact , we can see Mars in the evening sky now , glowing like a dull red coal through the bare trees to the southeast . To some ancient civilizations , Mars had ominous connotations ( blood , death , the bringer of war , and all that apocalyptic stuff ) , but to the modern amateur astronomer , its appearance in the east shortly after sunset can mean only one thing : The planet is approaching opposition , which is the most favorable time to scrutinize this world in a telescope . This month , Mars ' equatorial diameter swells from 10.8 " on January 1 to 13.5 " by month 's end . Its magnitude increases from - 0.3 on January 1 to - 1.1 on January 31 . It is only 0.1 magnitude brighter at opposition on February 11 . This is as bright and as large as Mars gets this year . Mars is the only planet on which permanent surface markings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a clear steady night round the time of opposition , any telescope at moderate modification can resolve the major albedo features , like the wedge-shaped plain Syrtis Major , the bright circular dust bowl known as Syrtis Major , the dark , irregular oval Meridiani Sinus , and the arch-shaped Sabeus Sinus . Unfortunately , the planet 's apparent diameter is not as large this go-round as it has been during recent oppositions , so these features are less prominent than they could be . Thus , the planet dwindles in apparent size over the next few months . First Views : Quadrantid Meteors The Moon is a thin waxing crescent on January 3 , so the stage is cleared for the Quadrantid meteor shower , which peaks on that day at 6 p.m . EST . The radiant , which lies in northern Bootes , is circum-polar in many locales in the Northern Hemisphere , but it does n't rise high into the sky for observers in the United States until around 1 a.m . Hence , we will probably not get our best views of this shower until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the Quadrantids , the maximum zenithal hourly rate  --  the number of meteors an observer can expect to see during the peak in a clear , dark sky when the radiant is overhead  --  fluctuates between 60 and 110 . The Quads are fairly slow moving , and are usually not very bright . Dark sky conditions help , as does having a cloud-free sky , which may be rare in January ! If you want to do your thing for science , how about counting some falling stars ? Go out and count the number of Quadrantid meteors you see per hour a few days before and after the peak . Report your observations , along with your location ( latitude and longitude ) , seeing conditions , and observing times , to Rainer Arlt , Visual Commission , International Meteor Organization , Berliner Strasse 41 , D-14467 , Potsdam , Germany . Such observations help further our understanding of near-Earth meteor activity and our local interplanetary environment , which , in turn , sheds light on cosmic debris in the solar system . The Moon Pairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quarter Moon occults Spica , an event that will be visible across most of North America , except Alaska and northern Canada . The occultation begins around 6 a.m . EST and ends about two hours later . Daylight will interfere with the end of the occultation for observers in the central and eastern time zones . Spica may be the brightest object in Virgo , but next to the half-lit Moon , its visual presence pales . Binoculars or a small telescope help bring out the star , though with Spica passing behind the Moon 's bright west limb , you need moderate magnification to really appreciate the drama of the star 's disappearance . Up until the occultation , Spica sits off the bright lunar limb like a diamond chip that has become separated from its grander setting . That view alone will be worth a peek . The Starry Sky : Canis Major The brightest star of all is Sirius , the Dog Star , in the constellation Canis Major , the Greater Dog . Its brilliance makes it impossible to mistake , but any confusion can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally toward Sirius . As seen from the United States , the Dog Star rises in the southeast and arcs across the southern sky , The height of the arc depends on your latitude . We southerners see this star at its highest as a glittering white diamond about halfway to overhead . The constellation Canis Major , sometimes called the Dog of Orion , makes one of the sky 's most interesting patterns . Sirius is central in a straight line of three stars . The 2nd-magnitude star to the west is called Murzim , " The Announcer , " because it rises shortly before Sirius . The Dog 's hips are marked by a small triangle of 2nd-magnitude stars . They are called Adhara , Aludra , and Wesen . On a clear night , to the right of a line between Sirius and this triangle , a bright open star cluster , M41 , can be seen with the naked eye . No doubt it was the prominence of Sirius that caused this cluster to be known in ancient times . It was mentioned by Aristotle in 325 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots . " Five thousand years ago in ancient Egypt , Sirius was worshipped as the Nile Star or Star of Isis . Its appearance in the predawn sky each summer heralded the start of the annual flood of the Nile River , whose fertile sediments made the river valley one of civilization 's first cradles of agriculture . Sirius can be seen rising shortly before the Sun in the hottest part of summer . In the Middle Ages , skywatchers believed that the combined light of the Sun and the Dog Star created the extreme summer heat . Consequently , the hottest weeks of summer are still sometimes known as Dog Days . The name Sirius comes from a Greek word meaning " the trembling one " or " sparkling one . " Its twinkle is so fierce because it is so bright , and because it is often seen low in the sky , from whence its light must travel to us through a greater-than-usual thickness of atmosphere . Earth 's atmosphere also causes Sirius to flash many different colors , yet if you saw this star from outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our earthly perspective on Sirius causes it to be special to us . Sirius may be our sky 's brightest star , but it 's no giant in the Milky Way Galaxy . It 's an ordinary main-sequence star , about twice the diameter of the Sun . It is bright because it is very close , the nearest of all naked-eye stars visible from mid-northern latitudes , at about 8.6 light-years away . Hidden to the eye , however , is something truly amazing about Sirius . Its companion , Sirius B , sometimes called the Pup , was the first white dwarf discovered and is still the brightest and nearest of all the white dwarfs . It was first sighted in 1862 . Sirius B has an average density over 100,000 times greater than that of water . A handful of this star 's material weighs as much as an elephant . Such will be the final state of stars like the Sun . Saturn Owns the Evening Sky Four months after opposition , Saturn has sort of planed out as far as magnitude and apparent diameter are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does n't vary in diameter by more than 0.7 " . Still , Saturn is a planet to watch this year because Earth will pass twice through the ring-plane : The first time , May 22 , Earth passes from north to south . Then , on August 11 , we pass from south to north . During these times , Saturn 's rings gradually dwindle to an edge-on presentation , like looking along the cutting edge of a knife . For brief intervals around these times , the rings totally vanish from view in a telescope . During Saturn 's 29.5-year orbit , we see two sides of this ringed wonder . For approximately fifteen years we see the north face inclined in our direction , then , as Earth 's orbit gradually slips through Saturn 's orbital plane , which is inclined 2.5deg to the ecliptic , we see the planet turn its south face our way . Saturn 's rings were last edge-on in 1980 , and maximally inclined toward the Sun in 1987 . We 'll see the rings at their maximum inclination again  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passes Venus On the 27th , the waning crescent Moon , just three days before new , rises in the morning sky with bright Venus just off to the southwest . The minimum angular separation apparent in the United States is about 0.2deg . From southern Mexico or Central America , you can see a spectacular occultation . But this pairing will be stunning in its own right , and an opportunity for astrophotographers to snap a memorable celestial-terrestrial composition . Here 's my suggestion : Use a 100 mm telephoto and Kodachrome 64 film  --  it 's forgiving of exposure and has such a fine grain that a does n't look like a Navajo sand painting when enlarged . Set your lens to f/4 or 4.5 and bracket 1/2-second exposures at least two stops . ( Move up a stop and shorten exposure time with faster film . ) Wake Up with Venus You morning folk have another reason to greet the day with a whoop . Venus is more prominently placed in the morning sky after lying low along the eastern horizon for the past month and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky and was no doubt the cause of many a UFO concern . This year , it beams brightly through the cold morning twilight like a distant jet coming with its landing lights on . Still fresh from inferior conjunction , the planet sports a kind of half-moon phase that is quite visible in any size telescope . Do n't use high power , though , because you 'll only magnify the turbulent convective cells in Earth 's atmosphere that make stars and planets twinkle violently . You ca n't see anything on Venus anyway ; the planet , like Milwaukee or Seattle , is constantly obscured in clouds , so even the best of telescopes renders a dazzling white ball . The interesting thing to look for and monitor is the phase of the planet as it edges away from the Sun . Over the coming weeks , the planet will grow fuller . Observer 's Challenge : Jupiter Loses Its Spots It 's a little difficult at press time to predict the disposition of Jupiter 's comet scars by January , especially since this kind of event has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July , it produced a series of black splotches in the planet 's southern hemisphere . Some astronomers predict these features may remain visible for a year or more , although they may fade beyond the reach of small telescopes . The bottom line is , nobody knows how these things will behave in the next few months , or how long they will remain visible . The best advice for observing Jupiter is to remain vigilant . If nothing else , as these features fade , they will encourage observers to appreciate the many other subtle details visible in Jupiter 's atmosphere . Recall that the impact sites began to blend with each other before the week of collisions had even concluded , so it 's no surprise that they have continued to merge , although most are still identifiable . The largest impact , from fragment G , persists as a subtle knot in the band of comet bruises , but even that feature is probably not long lived . What would be interesting to do now would be to delve into the records of the Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features that resemble the ones seen in the immediate aftermath of S-L 9 . Perhaps comet collisions around Jupiter happen more often than we think ; perhaps someone else will discover the traces of a long gone comet . If so , would n't that say something interesting about Jupiter and the not-too-distant interplanetary environment ? Observing Asteroid 654 Zelinda Diving down trough western Gemini and into Orion is the 75-mile-wide carbonaceous body 654 Zelinda . At opposition on January 2 , it reaches a bright apparent magnitude of 10 , making it detectable in a 4- to 6-inch telescope . On the first , the Zelinda search region lies about 4deg west of Zeta ( zeta ) Geminorum . As the month progresses , the asteroid moves rapidly southwest ( its inclination to the ecliptic is a rather steep 18deg ) . On the 17th , Zelinda lies a little over 1deg west of Gamma : ( gamma ) Geminorum and by the month 's final week crosses into northern Orion ( northwest of the Hunter 's club ) . Use the finder chart and table of coordinates to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutting through northwestern Ursa Major , and an easy target in binoculars in a dark , haze-free sky , is Comet Borrelly . This periodic comet , discovered in 1902 , comes around every seven years . Its 1987 return was a little better than this year 's , but this apparition is not bad either . When it reached perihelion this past November , it peaked about magnitude 7.7 . Still , it is holding its own at magnitude 9 as it makes its way toward opposition on January 20 . During the last two weeks of January the comet passes close to the bright galaxies M81 and M82 , creating a " photo op . " <p>
