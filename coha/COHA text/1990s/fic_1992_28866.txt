Only With Your Love Chapter One Before ten minutes had passed the sounds of combat died away and hundreds of footsteps seemed to pound the deck . Celia remained in the cabin , longing to open the door and see what had happened . But all she could do was wait with terrified anticipation . She stiffened with alarm as heavy feet walked the length of the companionway and the door rattled . " Locked , " a voice growled . Celia jumped as a blunt object crashed against the other side of the door , splintering the fine paneling . Swiftly she readied the gun to fire . Another sharp blow , and the hinges creaked in protest . Celia used her palm to wipe at the cold sweat on her face . She raised the barrel of the pistol , pressing it to her temple . At the touch of the metal to her skin , thoughts raced through her mind . If Philippe had died , she would not want to live . And if she did not use the gun on herself now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea bandits . But something inside rebelled at the thought of pulling the trigger . She took a deep breath and steadied her hands . The door crashed open . Frozen , she stared at the two men who stood there , both swarthy and unkempt , their matted hair held back with kerchiefs , their faces sunburned and stubbled . The shorter of the two held a cutlass in his hand , while the other clasped a bloodstained boarding pike . Dropping his cutlass , the small but sturdily built man stepped over the sill at the bottom of the doorway . He licked his lips and watched her with keen eyes . " Put it down , " he muttered in a thick American accent , gesturing to the gun . Celia could n't utter a word . Now , her mind insisted , end it now ... But her arm lowered to her side . In a flash of self-hatred , she realized she was too much of a coward to take her own life . " I 'll stake me share of th ' spoils now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth split in a yellowtoothed grin as he walked toward her . Automatically Celia raised the gun and squeezed the trigger , feeling as if some force outside herself was guiding her actions . The bullet that should have ended her own life buried itself in the man 's chest . A crimson flood spread over his unwashed shirt . Blood spattered everywhere , and Celia heard herself scream as the body crumpled at her feet . " Little bitch ! " Enraged , the other pirate grabbed her and threw her against the wall . The pistol fell from her hand and clattered to the floor . Her head hit the hard surface , and she halffainted , sinking into a world filled with gray mist . She moaned as she was dragged through the companionway and up to the main deck , where she was dropped to the yellow planking . The ship rang with the sound of voices , and barrels and boxes being moved across the deck . There was a strange smell mingling with the scents of salt water and sea air . Blinking hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw one of the pirates drop a crate of chickens , some of the live cargo taken aboard to allow the crew of the Golden Star occasional rations of fresh meat . The crate broke open and the frightened birds scuttled in every direction , causing an outbreak of laughter and swearing . As she looked at the scene around her , Celia put a hand to her mouth , afraid she was going to be sick . There were bodies everywhere , with gaping holes , partially severed limbs , and glassy stares . The deck was coated with blood . She recognized some of the Iifeless faces ... the ship 's Cooper , always so cheerfully busy with his hoops and staves ; the sailmaker ; the cook ; the boy who had served as tailor and cobbler ; some of the officers with whom she and Philippe had shared meals . Philippe ... Frantically she crawled toward the bodies , desperate to find her husband . A booted foot shoved her back to the deck . She cried out in pain as a hand tangled in her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cruelest eyes she had ever seen . The man was smooth-shaven and darkly tanned , his jaw thin , his nose a decisive point in a sharp-featured face is hair was dark reddish-brown , pulled back in a neat braided queue . Unlike the othersof the boarding party , he wore well-made clothes that had been tailored to fit his wiry body . " You cost me a good man , " he said in a crisp voice . " For that you 'll make amends . " He inspected her slim-hipped , small-breasted body with an asexual glance . She tried to push down the hem of her gown , which had ridden up to expose her bare feet and calves . He smiled , revealing a jagged line of teeth . " Yes . You 'll serve as entertainment for my brother Andr . " His hand tightened in her hair , bringing tears of pain to her eyes . " Andr needs a steady supply of women . Unfortunately they never last long with him . " One of the pirates approached them . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Captain Legare , the best of the cargo should take well nigh an hour to unload . Not much gold , sir , but some fine dry goods , cinnamon , brandy , oil in jars  --  " " Good . As for the remainder of their crew , lock them in the hold . We 'll set fire to the ship when we put away for the island . " Legare shoved Celia at the young man . " Bind the wench and put her in with the spoils . We 're taking her with us . And tell the men not to touch her . She 's for Andr . " At the mention of the Star 's crew , Celia had begun to struggle . " There are some still alive ? " she gasped . The young man dragged her away , seeming not to hear her .
