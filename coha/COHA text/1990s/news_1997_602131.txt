<p> LOS ANGELES  --  In Georgia , they built a stadium by a lake in Jonesboro and staged a beach volleyball tournament that was one of the biggest hits at last summer 's Olympics . <p> At the Los Angeles Tennis Center on the UCLA campus , they 've filled tennis courts with sand and , today through Saturday , hope to take the sport to a higher level with the inaugural World Championships of beach volleyball . <p> The field is larger and qualifying less restrictive than at the Olympics , so organizers and players are calling this the most competitive event in the sport 's history . <p> Everything you need to know about it , from A to Z : <p> A is for Armato . Leonard Armato . The agent for Shaquille O'Neal and boyfriend of top-ranked beach star Holly McPeak . Armato loved the competition at Atlanta so much that he came away with plans to bring all the sports ' tours together for one big international show . Voila ! The man gets things done . " I just want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Armato , the event 's co-promoter . " I think it can . " <p> B is for Breakthrough , which Dain Blanton achieved earlier this summer when , playing with Canyon Ceman , he became the first African-American to win an Association of Volleyball Professionals ( AVP ) event . This week , he is seeded second , a partner of Kent Steffes , who plays on the AVP tour with Brazilian Jose Loiola but had to choose a U.S. partner for this event . " It 's a great opportunity , " Blanton says . " I 've always wanted to play with Kent . " <p> C is for Ceman , who ended the partnership with Blanton to hook up with Olympic silver medalist Mike Whitmarsh . Blanton was stunned . " I thought we were the up-and-coming team , " he says . <p> D is for Dumped . As in 2,700 tons of sand were dumped on the tennis courts for this tournament . Also , as in getting dumped by your partner , an occupational hazard in the sport . Think of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reno , Karolyn Kirby/ Liz Masakayan . They 're all in L.A. this week , playing with somebody else . <p> E is for Equal opportunity . This sport has been much more financially rewarding for men than women , but this event provides equal purses of $ 300,000 for men and women . The $ 600,000 total is a beach volleyball record . <p> F is for " Fours , " shorthand for the four-person variety of the sport . Struggling for acceptance in a sport mostly defined by doubles , fours gets a shot in the arm by being included in this week 's championship . " It 's a great chance for us to gain some credibility , " says a fours star , who happens to be a model and budding TV personality whose name is . . . <p> G is for Gabrielle Reece . You might think veteran stars would resent Reece , a good-but-not-great player whose fame stems more from her looks than her volleyball accomplishments . Truth is , they like her too darn much to criticize . " She 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being the best player she can be , " veteran Linda Hanley says . <p> H is for Hot and Humid . Organizers liked the atmosphere at the Olympics so much they 've apparently decided to duplicate the weather , too . <p> I is for Izzy . . . oops , sorry , that was just a bad flashback from Atlanta . <p> J is for Jenny Johnson , daughter of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson . She 's playing in the four-person segment , as is Annett Davis , daughter of former NBA player Cleveland Buckner , who scored 33 points for the New York Knicks the night Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 for the Philadelphia Warriors . <p> K is for Karolyn Kirby , one of the sport 's greats , heartbroken when she failed to qualify at last year 's Olympic trials , hoping for better this week . <p> L is for Loiola . Jose Loiola , the Brazilian banned by his country 's federation four years ago when he came to the USA to play full time on the AVP tour . Now he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors this season by winning 13 tournaments . He 's playing this week with his old Brazilian partner , Anjinho . <p> M is for Malu , wife of international volleyball federation ( FIVB ) President Ruben Acosta . At the Olympics , Malu drew the ire of Kiraly by loudly cheering for Sinjin Smith , a loyal lieutenant of Acosta , during the now-famous match between Kiraly and Smith . When Kiraly won , he shouted and gestured toward Malu . A year later , Kiraly still wo n't fess up to what he said . " I think I told her , ' Merry Christmas . ' " <p> N is for Nine . That 's how many more AVP victories Smith ( 139 ) has than Kiraly ( 130 ) . Kiraly , 36 , needs one extraordinary year or two good ones to catch him . Whether he does or not , chances are both will be passed by Steffes , who , at 29 , already has 101 . <p> O is for Ole , Ole , Ole , Ole . . . Bra-sil , Bra-sil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the tournament , but you can bet they 'll be heard . They should have plenty to cheer about , especially on the women 's side . Brazil won gold ( Jackie Silva/Sandra Pires ) and silver ( Monica Rodrigues/Adriana Samuel ) in Atlanta . <p> P is for Perseverance , which is defined by Liz Masakayan still playing at a high level despite a history of knee problems that rivals Joe Namath 's . <p> Q is for Quit ? No , not Mike Dodd . He has lost longtime partner Mike Whitmarsh , with whom he won his Olympic silver medal , but he keeps plugging along at age 40 . He 's now playing with Rob Heidger . <p> R is for Redemption . The U.S. women flamed out badly at the Olympics , failing to win a medal after going in with a seemingly great chance of winning two medals . This is a chance to make amends . <p> S is for Sinjin Smith , 40 , who will try to turn back the clock one more time but is hobbling a bit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympics will forget the epic battle between Smith and Kiraly , his old partner-turned-rival . Smith , expected to be too old and beat up to offer a challenge to Kiraly , played magnificently in defeat , proving he could still play with anyone , including Karch . <p> T is for Tie-dyed bandanas . Thank you , Nancy Reno , for keeping them alive . <p> U is for UCLA volleyball . Among the alumni in the tournament : Smith , Kiraly , Randy Stoklos , Carl Henkel , David Swatik , McPeak , Hanley , Masakayan , Elaine Youngs and Elaine Roque . UCLA sometimes claims Steffes , too . He earned a degree at UCLA but never played there . <p> V is for veni , vidi , aloe vera : I came , I saw , I got sunburned . <p> W is for Where 's the beach ? It seems odd and a little sad to Kiraly that the sport 's first true world championship is being played just a few miles from the sport 's birthplace ( Santa Monica ) , yet is not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport is headed , " he says . <p> X is for Xylophone , which Bill Walton , who already plays piano and drums , might take up any day . What 's that got to do with anything ? Only that Walton will be part of NBC 's broadcast team , and that nothing having to do with beach volleyball starts with an X. <p> Y is for Yo , Bob Toledo , if I were you , I 'd move football practice off campus this week . When your players get a look at these , uh , uniforms , they might not be fully concentrating on 36 Power Trap . <p> Z is for Ze Marco and Emanuel , Brazil 's slim but skilled men 's duo sometimes referred to as " Skinny and Skinnier .
