AT AN EARLIER TIME , at any one of a number of earlier times , Mrs. Miller would have resisted , but now , sitting here in her apartment overlooking the Gulf , it was as natural as . . . as , Mrs. Miller thinks , breathing . Her mind goes back to an evening years before in Memphis . One of her husband 's business acquaintances , an architect , had taken them to see his elderly cousin-or perhaps it was a great-aunt , she could n't remember . But she remembered the house , the fire in the grate , the cousin/great-aunt seated there on the sofa under the portrait done of her by a painter who had come down from the North-that was what she said-a painter who had come down from the North to paint her . The old lady must have been in her nineties . <p> Mrs. Miller herself was young then-she must have been in her forties that evening in Memphis . But age at that time meant so very little to her . She would have known only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the back of the house to be introduced was making his home with her-this , Warren 's friend told them . No , a boy to Mrs. Miller now ; then he was a young man who looked to be in his thirties , though if there was one thing she had learned it was that looks could be deceiving . Age , she thought , was the least dependable of things-relative . He had not made much of an impression on her . He said very little-indeed seemed to hover just outside the fringes of the conversation . His name was Julian-for some reason , perhaps because it was not a name with which she was familiar , Mrs. Miller remembered it . <p> She did recall that at one point the old lady-Mrs . Holmes-had turned to the young man and asked him to play the piano for them . " Julian plays beautifully , " she said . " Julian , be an angel and play for us . " <p> Mrs. Miller thought the boy would as soon not have , but he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out any music played a piece for them-a very short piece , she remembered , something that was familiar to her though she could never think of it , probably Ravel or Debussy . Mrs. Holmes looked pleased and glanced at them to see how they reacted . They all praised him for it and asked him to play more , but he modestly declined the invitation . <p> Mrs. Holmes seemed to have an almost unnatural vitality that Mrs. Miller had noticed in some women her age . She talked of working in her rose garden , and of her trips to North Carolina , where she said she enjoyed climbs to the mountaintops . But that was obviously some time in the past , for she also mentioned how distressing it had been to have to give up her car-driving her car . Warren 's friend , the architect , had told them that she had a 1939 Packard . She had never driven in her husband 's lifetime , she said . There was no need to . But once she learned , once she got behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back " - she had gained her independence . That was her only reference to her late husband . <p> The young man sat there on the sofa by her and took in every word . Once he interrupted , or rather added the postscript that of course Mrs. Holmes had him to drive her wherever she wanted to go-a remark that clearly pleased the old lady . Altogether , Mrs. Miller thought , it was a curious evening . <p> Later , when Warren 's friend was driving them back to their hotel , he made insinuating remarks about the boy . The old lady had adopted him . " At least , " he said , " that 's the story . " The boy had shown up suddenly , or perhaps not so suddenly-Warren 's friend admitted that it was months , sometimes years , between his own visits with her . One version had it that Julian was a cousin-a cousin on her mother 's side , but so distant that no one else in the family had ever heard of him . There was even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not for the usual reasons , he told them with a sly laugh , but because she wanted the protection of the law that marriage would give her-give him-in matters of property . <p> Mrs. Miller remembered disliking Warren 's friend for his insinuations and thinking there was very likely nothing to them . Her husband was less critical , but then he always had been . Warren wondered aloud about the house , what would become of it . It was one of those splendid late-Victorian residences with stained-glass windows and huge sliding oak doors that separated the rooms and a magnificent oak staircase . The reason , in fact , that Warren 's friend had arranged for them to see it . <p> " Well , of course , " he said , anticipating the question , " whatever he gets , I 'd say he deserves it . " <p> " What an awful man , " she said to Warren when they got back to their room . " How on earth did you meet him ? " Mrs. Miller was of an earlier school that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without-should be separated . She despised above all else commonness . <p> Her husband was more tolerant . He had also been brought up in a society that believed in its own privileges , but he had been a banker long enough to know that the withouts sometimes become the withs , and that when they do , one should pay attention to them . <p> Mr. Miller laughed . " The way I figure it , " he said , " is that Richchard . . . " - Richard was the architect- " . . is that Richard was having regrets he had n't been nicer to her . " <p> Now , sitting here in her apartment overlooking the Gulf with night coming on , Mrs. Miller recalls another visit to Memphis . She and Warren were passing through on their way to Nashville a few years later . On the spur of the moment they decided to leave the highway and drive through the old residential section of the city , past Baptist Hospital and the other landmarks they remembered from their earlier visit . But when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they found only cleared ground where the house had stood . The home on the adjoining property , another of those Victorian mansions , was still there , but beyond it , to the end of the block , was a string of doctors ' offices . Mrs. Miller felt a shudder run through her . Gone , just like that , she thought . " What do you suppose ever happened to the boy ? " Warren asked her . <p> She did n't answer , but her dislike of the architect who had accompanied them to the house returned instantly . <p> " Probably did well for himself , " Warren said , and that was the end of the conversation . They drove back to the highway and continued on their way to Nashville . <p> Mrs. Miller remembers a summer much later , the summer after Warren died-ten years or more before Ellen died . Oh , Mrs. Miller thinks , to lose a child . . . there is nothing harder . She and Ellen had talked of taking a trip , perhaps to Pawley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , or-closer to home-New Orleans . They 'd decided on New Orleans . She recalls packing and Ellen getting out that red silk dress and that ridiculous straw hat , which would n't have gone at all with the lipstick she was wearing . It was a bad time for Ellen . She and George were having trouble-had been almost since the day they were married . But , Mrs. Miller thinks , it was n't as if I did n't warn her . That was Ellen : she never listened to anybody . <p> But what a lovely girl , what a lovely , lovely girl , she thinks . Her father 's eyes . When Warren looked at you , you could n't deny him anything . But unfortunately , as so often happens , the daughter had inherited her father 's disposition . No self-control . No self-discipline . Mrs. Miller could never understand it . <p> But the thought of that evening in Memphis reminded her of the trip she and Ellen made to New Orleans . They had driven down that summer after Warren died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her such a civilized city while at the same time winking at the coarse and the common , for there was nothing , she thought , more common than Mardi Gras . Kings and queens in preposterous costumes throwing beads from floats . Crowds of people jostling one another . Not her idea of fun . It was the other New Orleans Mrs. Miller liked , the elegance of St. Charles Avenue , the moss-hung trees in the Garden District , even the dark green streetcars with their wicker seats and the bell that the motorman rang to clear the tracks ahead . And of course Galatoire's-she loved to dine at Galatoire 's . <p> Ellen had a friend who lived in an apartment on the edge of the French Quarter , and one afternoon they rode the streetcar out St. Charles and wandered through the Garden District . You could do that then . Polly , Ellen 's friend , asked if they would like to go into one of the houses . The old lady who owned the place had been a friend of Polly 's grandmother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in late afternoon ; the sun was still high in the sky at that time of the year in New Orleans . <p> They sat on the upstairs back gallery overlooking a garden fragrant with cape jasmine and hanging baskets of petunias and the other plants that grew there in those days . Mrs. Hays , for that was the old lady 's name , was ageless , Mrs. Miller thought . She must have been in her eighties , but she could easily have passed for seventy-five or even seventy . She had lived all her life in New Orleans-had been born in one of the downstairs bedrooms in this very house , had been married in the double parlors . " And , " she told them-Mrs . Miller remembers this distinctly- " I have left instructions that I am to be buried from the house . I 've told them if they bury me from the funeral parlor I 'll come back to haunt them . " Mrs. Hays smiled , satisfied that that had settled that . <p> " But Aunt Lily , " Polly said-Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of speaking- " you 're going to outlive us all . You 're going to be coming to our funerals . " <p> Ellen nodded . Mrs. Miller nodded . The old lady smiled . She recognized the lie for what it was and was appreciative of it . <p> At that moment one of the shuttered doors down the gallery opened , and a young man came out and reminded Mrs. Hays that it was time for her medicine . Mrs. Miller noticed that he wore a white Palm Beach suit and carried a small tray on which she could see the pill-an ugly little red one-and a glass of water . Without a word Mrs. Hays took the pill , put it on the back of her tongue , and drank a swallow of the water . " Thank you , Louis , " she said . <p> The young man did not respond but set the tray on a wicker table , pulled up a chair , sat down , and lit a cigarette , a gesture that offended Mrs. Miller . She 'd never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies without asking their permission , and certainly not in New Orleans . Nor did he make any attempt to introduce himself . <p> But Mrs. Hays did not seem to notice . " Louis , " she said , " is my eyes-my ears too . I do n't know what I 'd do without him . " <p> The young man did not appear to have heard her . He stared down into the garden with an empty look that told Mrs. Miller his mind was probably somewhere other than in New Orleans . Then , as if suddenly aware they were looking at him , he turned back to Mrs. Hays and asked if she would like him to bring her a wrap ; there was a breeze off the river that pulled at the ends of the old lady 's white hair . Mrs. Miller thought she might be shivering . <p> " No , dear , " the old lady said , and as if anticipating what might be going through their heads , she told them how good the young man had been to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip in New Orleans . " And to him , " Louis , will you tell Camilla to serve the coffee ? " The young man got up , crushed out his cigarette on the tray , and disappeared inside the house . <p> There were so many questions Mrs. Miller would have liked to ask Mrs. Hays , but the opportunity did not present itself . Was Louis another of the servants ? She imagined not . How long had he been there ? What kind of life did he have beyond the cast-iron fence and the luxuriant garden ? And of course Mrs. Miller-a bit older now , wiser-would have liked to know where he slept . <p> The last of these questions was answered when Ellen 's friend said , " Aunt Lily , you do n't mind , do you , if I take them through the house ? " <p> " Why no , " the old lady replied . " Go ahead . I 'm just going to sit here . Polly , be sure to show them the clock . " <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . Mrs. Hays 's grandfather had made it-or at least had built the case . Polly told them he had been a cabinetmaker . <p> Mrs. Hays 's bedroom was at the front of the house and looked out onto the street . The bed was a graceful four-poster with a tester , probably mahogany or walnut , Mrs. Miller thought . No doubt a family heirloom . Clearly the smaller room adjoining was the one the young man occupied-his clothes , his shoes ( among them , to Mrs. Miller 's amazement , a pair of cowboy boots ) were in the closet . In the bathroom she saw his comb and brush and razor on a small table by the lavatory . She had not really thought they shared a bedroom , but she was relieved to see they did not , and then annoyed with herself for having suspected that they might . She hoped Ellen 's friend had not somehow read her thoughts . <p> " A charming house , " Ellen said when they were seated again on the gallery . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and she commented on the clock , what a treasure it was . She had always made it a practice to tell people exactly what they wanted to hear . " And you were so sweet to let us see it , but we really must go now .... Ellen , get your things , we really must go now . " <p> " Well , " the old lady said , " I ca n't tell you how much I 've enjoyed this . I seldom get out anymore , you know . Just Louis and me here , the two of us . But you must come again . " And she raised her voice . " Louis . . " <p> In that instant the young man reappeared from inside the house . <p> " Louis , would you show these ladies to the door ? " she said . <p> As he was showing them the way down the stairs , Mrs. Miller noticed that he had taken off his tie and that his shirt was open at the neck . She was also aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Ellen had felt it , or Ellen 's friend , or if it was only she . At any rate , she was certain it was there . <p> In a letter written a few weeks after their return home , Polly told them of Mrs. Hays 's death . She had simply slipped away in her sleep : The way we would all want to go , Polly wrote . Mrs. Hays had been buried from one of the St. Charles Avenue funeral homes . Not what she wanted , Polly wrote , but her nieces preferred it . The story goes around that she left a nice sum of money to Louis and that the nieces plan to contest it . You remember Louis , I 'm sure . A t the funeral poor Louis seemed quite broken up . <p> Mrs. Miller shivers in the chill of the evening 's last light . In a moment she will get up and turn on the lamp . She thinks of Warren . Dear , sweet Warren , that blue-eyed boy she loved so , wanted from the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Warren knew how to make you forgive him , how to make you overlook everything , except maybe the one thing , and that was what love was all about , was n't it ? <p> I 've grown old , Mrs. Miller thinks . I 've outlived my husband and my child , and nobody should do that . But I do n't want to die either . Is that foolish of me ? <p> She calls Ellen-calls out her name as if Ellen were there . It is the closest she has come in a very long time to venting her heart . She knows Ellen is dead and will not be coming back . And even if Ellen can hear her-and , Mrs. Miller thinks , who 's to say she can not ? - how is she to know ? <p> She waits . Through the double windows she sees lights on the water-a boat coming in from the Gulf . Then the lights pass from view , and she is looking into the dark again . <p> On the gallery that afternoon in New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of a hand . The young man touched Mrs. Hays 's arm , probably without intending to ; the old lady instinctively pulled away-a movement so slight that in the bat of an eye Mrs. Miller might have missed it . <p> And again , another evening in another city , years later , she saw , or thought she saw , the same quick movement , that hesitation , that almost involuntary act of pulling back from something . It was in a hotel on the Gulf Coast : the old lady and the young man seated in the lobby , in those times when people-and the very best people-still sat in lobbies . The young man wore white shoes with his white suit , and he was quite attentive-fussed over the old lady , left her and went up in the elevator and came back with a shawl , helped her up and then offered her his arm , and they went into the dining room together . There was something else that she noticed : a girlishness , almost a flirtatiousness about the old lady that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of her mother , then in her seventies , and the friend 's unmarried daughter . The daughter was Mrs. Miller 's age or older ; she did a good deal of talking and had little to say-the curse of southerners , Mrs. Miller thought . She was a southerner herself , but she had lived too long in the North . She despised in them what she herself had never been : a bore , a chatterbox . She detested mindless conversation . But on and on the daughter rattled , at last coming back to the young man and the old lady , who were now seated at a table across the dining room from them . She wondered aloud if they were a couple , and if they were , how long they had been married , hinting somewhere in her chatter ( Mrs. Miller 's mind had wandered ) that perhaps the marriage was not what it seemed . She had known one instance , she said , of a lady , traveling abroad , who had married a man forty or more years younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her mother lifted her eyebrows , exactly why Mrs. Miller could not be certain-probably raising the question of whether or not the marriage had been consummated . Mrs. Miller kept her thoughts to herself but was of the opinion that sex was the last thing that would interest a woman of eighty-wrong , as she was to discover , but she was then in her fifties . <p> The lady who had known her mother was not about to let the story go . She recalled an elderly cousin who had died soon after a young man showed up at her door one day . " Call it coincidence if you like , " she said . <p> Mrs. Miller listened and said nothing . Life , she had learned from living it , was a series of mysteries . <p> Her mother 's friend waited for a few moments before continuing . " There are angels of death , " she said . " Oh , yes . I 'm telling it as it was told to me . They come . . . " She looked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , as it was told to me , a sort of escort service . " <p> The daughter laughed . " Mother ! " <p> " Oh , it 's true , " her mother said . " I 've seen it . I do n't know how many times I 've seen it . " <p> So when the knock came Mrs. Miller was not surprised at all , but in the most peculiar of ways welcomed it . She got up and crossed the dark room , stopped to turn on the lamp by the sofa , made her way into the foyer . <p> The knock came again . Mrs. Miller stood at the door , not quite certain what she would do . Yet it occurred to her that she had been here before , stood at this same door , heart pounding as it was now , as if she were about to embark on the most extraordinary journey . <p> " Yes ? " she called . " Yes ? " This time louder . <p> Through the door she could hear a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand what he was saying . <p> Oh , Warren . . . Ellen , she thought , I know I 'm getting ready to do something foolish , do n't blame me . <p> Once , when she was a child and full of absurd fears , she had spent many of her nights dreaming . She had dreamed of falling from a great height . It was terrifying . She had wondered , in her dream , whether the fall would kill her , but always she had awakened before the fall ended . Or other nights , in the same dream , she had simply landed , feet first , safely on the ground , and after many of these she knew , even as she . dreamed , that the fall would not hurt her . But the point was that it might , one night it might-there was always that possibility . <p> When the knock came again Mrs. Miller unlatched the chain and opened the door to him . As she did , something that she thought might be terror seized her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin was pale , and he had a blush of red in his cheeks and long , sandy lashes . The bluest of eyes . The face , she thought , of an angel . He reminded her of a boy she had known once a thousand years ago at Pawley 's Island . The boy 's name was . . . well , she could n't remember it now , in a little while it would come to her , but this boy did turn her mind back to him . <p> Then she saw that he was wearing a Mardi Gras costume . At least she thought it was a costume-he 'd taken off his cap and mask and was holding them , but he was wearing a red devil 's suit with a tail . He had a pitchfork in one hand . <p> " I think I 've come to the wrong apartment , " the young man said . " I 'm looking for 204B-there 's a party . " <p> Mrs. Miller stood there for a moment and stared at him . " Oh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved and disappointed , but most of all puzzled . After she had caught her breath and gathered her wits she pointed him on his way-the party was in the next building , probably those girls with the three-legged cat and the friends who raced up and down the beach on their motorcycles . The last she saw of him he was dragging his red tail down the stairs . <p> Mrs. Miller laughed . When she had closed the door she sat down on the sofa and laughed again . She knew she ought to be embarrassed . The angel of death never came for Mrs. Miller . It was the supreme disappointment of her life . No one came to escort her , or to look after her , or to light her cigarettes , or to listen to her stories , or to entertain her guests with a tune from Debussy . No , it was Ravel : " Pavane for a Dead Princess . " Yes , Mrs. Miller thought , that was what it was-that was the piece the young man had played for them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her tongue all these years . But no young man came to do any of these things for her , and she was a part of no one 's 751 stories about how an old lady had brought a young man into her home , possibly ( stories had a way of developing out of nothing at all ) married him . <p> After a while Mrs. Miller grew tired of waiting and checked herself into a nursing home , where she died in her ninety-first year , deeply disillusioned but also wiser : she 'd wasted too much time waiting , she 'd spent too much time remembering Warren and Ellen and trying to figure out what she might have done differently . She 'd been too critical of people . Common is as common does , her mother had told her , but she had missed the point . All those rules she 'd memorized about what was the right thing and the wrong thing and what was common or not common really did n't matter . Did n't matter a damn , Mrs. Miller thought . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and took you out of this life , she was sure of it . Probably she had seen one-in Memphis and , unlikely place , New Orleans . For what else was Julian , driving Mrs. Holmes around Memphis in her 1939 Packard , and what else was Louis , with his white Palm Beach suit and the cowboy boots she 'd seen sitting on the floor in his closet ? It was just that one never came for her . <p> Toward the end , somewhere between four and five o'clock on a rainy spring morning when the nursing home was quiet , there was a knock at Mrs. Miller 's door . She was at low ebb and tired of living , and she roused and told whoever it was to enter . But when the nurse on duty turned the knob and pushed her way into the room , Mrs. Miller was already dead . <p>
