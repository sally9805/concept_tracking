Section : INTERNATIONAL A return to the camps brings memories of horror  --  and evidence that China profits from its gulags <p> The uniformed prisoners with their shaven heads were working in a vineyard under the stern gaze of armed police guards . Watching the scene , I slowed my bicycle , then stopped . We must find a way , I thought , to record these victims of laogai ( reform-through-labor ) at Tuanhe Farm , a Beijing re-education camp . I switched on the video camera peeking out of the bag on the back of my wife 's bike . <p> " What do you think you 're doing ? " shouted a guard . <p> " Just fixing my bike , " I called back . I spoke as calmly as I could . But I felt breathless with fear , in danger of being plunged back into the hellish world of the camps-a world I had not so long ago escaped . For I spent 19 years as a political prisoner in China 's labor reform camps , five and a half of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looking at ? " the guard shouted . " Nothing , " I cried back . But in fact my eyes were focused on the prisoners bent over in the field , on the red pennants planted around them ; I thought of the shot that would be fired if any man so much as stepped outside its perimeters . <p> " Cut them off ahead ! " the guard cried to several other guards stationed in the distance . " Go ! Get out of here ! Leave me ! " I hissed to my wife . As she pedaled frantically north , and I rode south , I could see the guards coming toward me across the field on their own bicycles like two torpedoes homing in on a ship . Suddenly they were on me , knocking me from my bike , twisting my arm behind my back , stomping on my spine with their boots . <p> " What are you doing here ? " one of the officers barked . <p> " Nothing ! I just lost my way , " I lied . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . I just stopped to ask directions , " I said , hoping my wife had escaped . <p> " Do n't you know this is a labor camp ? " <p> " A what ? " I asked dumbly . " I 'm from America ; what is that ? " I showed them my U.S. re-entry permit , which they examined quizzically , unable to read the English . Then I pulled out my money belt and , after some negotiation , peeled off a stack of bills  --  perhaps as much as $500 , more than a year 's salary in China . I thrust a wad at each guard and , trembling , picked up my bike and started away . They did not protest or follow . When I was finally out of their sight , I almost fainted with relief . <p> What would have happened if I were caught ? I am not only a Chinese citizen , but a former " counterrevolutionary rightist . " Working with the human-rights group Asia Watch , I have dedicated myself to exposing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of China to the other , to bear witness to the nightmare that I and millions of other innocent Chinese have been forced to endure . After being released from prison , I had gone to America and tried to feel free . What I wanted most was to forget my past , to erase the brand that had been stamped on my heart . But some things do n't go away . The experiences of 19 years in the camps kept streaming into my mind . How could I turn my back on what I had witnessed ? I remember that at the Tuanhe Farm , in the late 1960s , one prisoner did n't complete his harvesting quota for the day . Our captain called a " struggle meeting " to criticize him . He had the prisoner tied to a post without a shirt , just as the sun was going down and the mosquitoes were starting to swarm . Soon his body was covered with black mosquitoes . I still remember the sound of his screams . Finally the captain released him and he fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tiny box : Other sadistic guards tied prisoners by the thumbs and hung them from the rafters , letting them down just before they might be permanently crippled . I had my own hands tied and shoved up behind my back so high , for so long , that I fainted . At first it hurt , but later , when I was semiconscious , I felt nothing at all . I have watched so many prisoners starve to death and go half crazy from being forced to lie alone in the tiny box , which we called " little number , " without food or blankets ... I had to go back and try to show the world . Friends said I was mad to attempt this trip . But my wife , a Taiwan citizen , suggested we go as tourists , like any other overseas Chinese couple on tour . Using my English name , Harry Wu , to throw off the authorities , we managed to get visas . And so , on June 9 , my wife , Ching-Li , and I took off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program on forced labor , covered the costs . <p> Nervous about being noticed by the police , we moved quickly . On two separate trips , I visited more than 20 camps , videotaping secretly whenever we could . Sometimes I posed as a tourist , sometimes as a businessman , eager to do business with the prison factories which use forced labor to produce goods for secret export abroad . I had brought one of my old Mao suits , and my old Chinese identity papers , which were invaluable for playing the role of a local . In Qinghai I wore a police uniform so that I could get close enough to prisoners in the fields to film them . And once or twice , I went without disguise-even visiting with a former warden . I switched hotels on a moment 's notice , and sometimes changed travel plans at the very last minute just in case we had aroused suspicion and were being followed without knowing it . <p> Miraculously we passed through Chinese customs without trouble , and the next day I retraced my steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Posing as family members of guards who lived in the camp , we slipped past the guards at the camp 's border.We could n't see the prisoners ' quarters , but on the sprawling grounds , 12 miles wide , hundreds of inmates were hard at work . How hauntingly familiar it all was . It was here that I was first assigned after my arrest . ( I was originally detained for criticizing the Soviet Union 's invasion of Hungary ; like countless other prisoners , I was never formally charged , tried or sentenced . ) It was in Qinghe in the early 1960s that starvation reduced me to 72 pounds . It was here that I worked for four years , had been confined for days in the " little number " punishment box . It was here that I several times tried to end my despair by attempting suicide . <p> As my wife and I drove by , prisoners with shaven heads were digging a canal by hand along the road just as I had once done . Then there was the brick wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringed with electrified barbed wire and police guard towers . Behind 585 was what we used to call Camp 586 . It was an empty field , the burial ground for those thousands of prisoners who died in Qinghe during the famine that followed Mao 's collectivization of agriculture . There were few in the camp who did not understand what was meant when someone said bitterly , " He has been transferred to 586 . " <p> It was at a camp outside Beijing that I first learned to steal and fight . During the famine of the winter of 1960 , we were fed only sorghum and ground maize cobs . The iron mine where I was working had been shut ; we were too undernourished to labor . Instead the camp stored cabbage there . I was sent to turn the rotting vegetables and learned how to steal the cabbage hearts without leaving any mark . We used to fight over food . I learned that you need to first punch your adversary in the nose and eyes so he ca n't see . I fought often after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my wife and I went to the Wangzhuang Coal Mine , or Shanxi Number Four Reform-Through-Labor Detachment , in mountainous Shanxi province . Here I had spent nine years . Every month , prisoners lost arms or legs or feet when mine shafts caved in or coal gas exploded . These things were normal in the prison mine . Once I had become trapped in a collapsed coal mine and was given up for dead . I emerged barely able to move , to find that they had prepared my coffin . This time , as we approached through the bleak slagheaped landscape , it almost seemed as if I had never left . When I once again saw my old and loyal friends- " counterrevolutionaries " like me-it was hard to enjoy the reunion . Unlike me , who had won release when Deng Xiaoping came to power and pardoned many political prisoners , they were still being detained in this dismal mine as " forced job placement personnel . " They lived a life of quasi freedom just outside the prison compound , but surrounded by police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fraction of what ordinary workers receive . If they disobeyed commands , they were punished along with the prison 's inmates . They were forbidden to go home . <p> I could n't help remembering a fellow inmate from 1971 . He had completed his sentence but continued to be held as a forced laborer . When he tried to escape , the authorities threw him into solitary confinement . There , in frustration , he wrote four words that cost him his life : " Down with Chairman Mao . " After he was executed , we held a " struggle session " to criticize him . <p> Donning the garb of a prisoner , I went down into the mine itself with forced laborers as my lookouts , just as I had once done day after day . We had worked sometimes more than 24 hours straight  --  there were no " shifts " of workers-to chisel our way through a whole vein of coal before quitting . This time at the mine , I spoke with a 45-year-old " worker . " In 1960 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job thousands of miles away from his home in Shanghai . Before he knew it , he had been thrown on a train with hundreds of other youths , sent out to the coal mines of Shanxi province , where he was put " under investigation . " For 30 years , the coal-mine worker has been forced to stay , labeled an ex-con , tied for life to the prison mine . Once , when he tried to flee , the police put him into solitary confinement until he admitted his error . " I want to go home , " he begged me . But there was nothing I could do to help . <p> who of course knew nothing about my real mission . The warden was shocked but pleased by my visit . Condescendingly , he told me I showed real revolutionary spirit in returning to visit my former jailer . I lectured him on the advantages of capitalism . Now that I think of it , I must have been mad . He did not answer . He just stared back at me with unblinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as we had come . Armed with name cards and knowledge about the export trade that I had acquired working for an import firm in California , we went to Shanghai . <p> Like all other such prison enterprises in China , each factory had two identities : one name as a reform-through-labor detachment , and one name as a production unit , the better to mask the real identity of the enterprise from foreign businessmen who might be unwilling to deal products made by forced labor . With prison enterprise managers now as eager for hard currency and bonuses as everyone else in China , I knew they must be engaging in illicit trade . No one had yet managed , though , to get substantive proof . If they were exporting to the United States , I wanted evidence and to find out how they were doing it . <p> Operating as businessmen gave us extremely good cover . In fact , at the Shanghai Laodong Pipe Works , an alias for the Shanghai Number Seven Reform-Through-Labor Detachment , we were stunned by the warm welcome we received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My wife had our hidden video camera whirring away in her bag . From our conversations , it was clear that they were not only already exporting goods to the United States but that they were eager for more such trade . We persuaded the managers to show us the production line . In the din of one of their several workshops were hundreds of prisoners all sitting before their machines . As we passed , they bowed their shaven heads . No one dared to make eye contact . <p> In the Shanghai Laodong Machinery Plant , which made hand tools , where the offices were filled with personnel in police garb , we were also received with great enthusiasm . I had gathered materials on this factory in the past , and former inmates had told me that it was a prison . Though the managers would n't let me visit the production line . " Actually , we need to speak quite openly with you , " said Lu Weimen , the factory manager , " because in the United States , Congress recently made quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He explained that his factory does n't export directly : " We always go through the import-export company system . " That is China 's state-run trading system . They were happy to connect us with the appropriate trading company Beijing 's North Science and Technology Co . After my return to America , the company wrote me a letter : " Dear Mr. Wu , We have cooperated with the Shanghai Laodong Machinery Factory on developing high-grade adjustable wrenches for exporting to the U.S. and have been their agents for several years . . . " <p> That was just one camp . What I discovered in Xining , the capital of Qinghai province , China 's Siberia , where millions of prisoners have been interned , was a city that had essentially been built around labor camps . Although the situation has improved recently , now that fewer political prisoners are being arrested , the number of prisoners and the severity of life in the province 's camps still terrify people . Prison labor has become a mainstay of the region 's economy . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is chockablock with the distribution outlet offices for all the factories and agricultural-processing enterprises that are attached to these prisons , Another suburban street , Nanshanjie , is a veritable miracle mile of labor camps . This street had become such a part of ordinary life that hardly anyone seemed to view it as an abomination . But occasionally I was reminded by an armed guard , a watchtower or a sign such as the one I saw on the wall of the Qinghai Construction Materials Factory , whose internal name is the Number Four Labor Reform Detachment . JUST WHO ARE YOU ? WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS ? WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE DOING HERE ? it asks . One of these very signs had been inscribed on a billboard at the Wangzhuang Coal Mine , where I had been imprisoned in Shanxi . These questions are supposed to make prisoners reflect on their fallen nature , and on their crimes , both political and otherwise . <p> Political repression is part of life in Qinghai . One young prisoner on duty in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Reform Detachment  --  said he had been sentenced to five years for his role in the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations . In the Qinghai Hide and Garment Factory , where I pretended to be a businessman interested in bartering for sheepskins , I saw a banner in the showroom awarded to the " factory " for its role in helping quell the " counterrevolutionary rebellion , " Beijing 's name for the protests . <p> Toxic chemicals : Inside the factory , a uniformed police officer named Wan Xiaohua gave me a tour of his primitive machinery , but I was more interested in the dozens of prisoners , heads shaved , at work processing sheepskins . Several had been ordered to strip naked and work the hides standing chest-deep in tanning vats of toxic chemicals . " Let me explain , " said the camp boss , surnamed Gao . " In the United States , they have their own laws and they are out to impose them on China . " The managers promised me they could find me an export company , despite the fact that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading company in Canton and another Hong Kong company . <p> In Hong Kong we sought out the managers from the Winmate Trading Co. , where executives told me they shipped skins to Korea for processing . Many of the finished goods are then exported to the U.S. market . " We send our people to keep on cheeking the quality , " said the manager , whom we taped secretly . " Once we report to them the quality is not up to standard , the prisoners will have punishment , or beating , or some other thing . " <p> Shortly after the Shanghai sting , I left China . I did n't know when I might see my motherland again . And I had left so many behind in the prisons . But I accomplished what I set out to do . Not long before , I had written a will . " Returning to the mainland holds great dangers for me-not the least of which are the possibilities of losing once more the freedom and happiness that were so hard to come by in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my ear seems to keep asking , ' Who will go ? ' And the answer that comes back to this question is : ' If I do n't go , who else will ?
