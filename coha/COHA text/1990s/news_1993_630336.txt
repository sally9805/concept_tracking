<p> Twenty-four years ago , Paul and Mary Davies built a new home in Park Ridge . This year they built it all over again - literally from the basement up . <p> The remodeling saga - which lasted seven months and cost more than the Davies care to admit - started when " he wanted an in-ground swimming pool and I yearned for a new first-floor bathroom , " recalled Mary Davies . <p> " One thing just led to another , " she said . <p> Carl Bongi , the Davies ' contractor , home builder and remodeler , said : " We built a new house inside their older home . It was a whole-house renovation plus two room additions . " <p> One addition was a 35-by-20-foot media room addition that is paneled completely in 1 1/4-inch-thick , carved , raised-panel oak . Of course , there 's a woodburning fireplace complete with mantel flanked by carved oak lions . Nearby is a Bose entertainment center with big-screen TV and two smaller televisions . <p> " The only thing we kept from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A marble family room fireplace crowned by a beveled and fluted mirror . A new bathroom with corner fiberglass whirlpool tub and leaded glass window . New oak hardwood floors - some with walnut inlays . And that in-ground swimming pool , which measures 18-by-36-feet , plus a new pool house designed to match the home 's architecture . <p> For homeowners who are wrestling with the question " Should we move or improve ? " ' Bongi , president of Palatine-based Bongi Development Corp. , said : " The best advice we can give if you decide to remodel is establish a close working relationship with the contractor of your choice , much the same as a doctor and patient , or lawyer and client . <p> " We like to walk through a project with our clients from their original thought concept to job completion to assure that there is clear communication about the client 's desires and satisfaction with our performance , " he said . <p> With mortgage and home improvement loan interest rates at a 22-year low , experts say an estimated $ 104 billion will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A remodeled older home can be a smart idea for some families , but the reasons can vary , " said Chicago Realtor Stephen W. Baird , president of Baird &; Warner Inc . " The house may simply need cosmetic improvements because it is aging . A growing family may need another bedroom or bathroom . <p> " Or longtime homeowners - like the Davies - may decide that they want to add a major improvement like a family room or in-ground swimming pool . " <p> For people like the Davies , the primary motivation is comfort and pleasure . However , if their mission is to increase the value of the home for eventual resale - which sometimes is the goal of buyers shopping for older homes with fix-up potential - they should realize that remodeling changes have different values in the marketplace , Baird said . <p> For example , Chicago area homeowners can expect to recover as much as 98 percent of the cost of a major kitchen remodeling project , according to studies by government agencies and the National Association of the Remodeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which include evaluations by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census , show you will get less than half ( 45 percent ) of your money back when you replace windows . <p> And real estate experts tell you that if you install a swimming pool in the Chicago area you 'd better enjoy swimming . <p> " You 're lucky to recoup a portion of that cost in the Midwest , " Baird observes . " In fact , it can be a detriment because the presence of a swimming pool automatically eliminates every potential buyer who does n't want a swimming pool . " <p> What about the 2-story atrium you built in your living room ? Or the $ 50,000 California hot-tub room addition you erected on the second-story deck ? And what about the fancy photographic darkroom you added in the basement for your teenage son ? <p> All of these improvements could be wasted money if the next owner of your home does n't like them . You might even have to cut the price of your home to market it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over improving a house . <p> " Adding a fourth bedroom might make sense , but not a fifth . If you are in a neighborhood where 3 or 4 bedrooms is the norm , few shoppers will be looking for the fifth and even fewer willing to pay extra for it , " Baird said . <p> Here are some thoughts on remodeling from the experts : Decide why you want to remodel . If your house does n't work the way you want for your family , you may be better off buying another house than trying to transform your present one . Do n't use the excuse that it 's a " smart investment " to do major improvements . Not all remodeling jobs pay off on resale . Improvements generally will pay off only if they match up with what most buyers are likely to want and expect . <p> For example , a 2-car garage , a family room , a powder room or bath on each floor , lots of closet and storage space , a private bath for the master bedroom , energy-saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay off at resale , experts say . <p> No matter how much you like them , improvements that may not pay off include a finished basement recreation room , screened-in porch or patio , a study , elaborate landscaping or a rock garden and reflecting pond with waterfall . <p> Experts say the most common - and cost efficient - home improvements are remodeling a kitchen , modernizing a bathroom , adding a bathroom or bedroom , insulating the home or replacing doors and windows for greater energy efficiency , and adding an energy-efficient fireplace . <p> Other popular projects include adding a terrace or patio and putting up a garage . Determine if the house has grown too old to justify the investment in remodeling or renovation . It 's a good idea to hire a professional home inspector to check the physical condition and mechanical systems - heating , cooling , plumbing and electrical . Also check the roof , foundation and floors . <p> Some remodeling jobs can multiply expenses . For instance , if you add a room , you may find the existing heating plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then need a larger-capacity furnace . Or you may find that you can not properly extend the ductwork to the addition . You have to buy an auxiliary unit . <p> A room addition also may mean not only more electrical outlets and switches , but a new , larger service box to provide additional capacity . You may need completely new wiring . Extending or adding plumbing lines can also add expense . Make your changes fit the house and neighborhood . If you 're not certain what improvements will fit your neighborhood , check with a local real estate broker to see what the market potential is for the improvement you 're planning . <p> For instance , adding a garage can be a great idea in the city , where parking is at a premium . But in the suburbs you may have to sacrifice a garden or play area to provide a garage . Do n't price yourself out of your neighborhood by over improving . This is the biggest mistake people commonly make , Realtors say . <p> " Neighborhoods generally fall into price levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest $ 50,000 in improvements , you 're probably not going to recover that money . Buyers looking for a $ 200,000 house will shop in a neighborhood with $ 200,000 homes , not $ 150,000 homes . Once you 've estimated the cost of remodeling , scout around your community for another house that has the space and features you are thinking about adding to your present house . <p> It 's possible that instead of spending $ 50,000 improving a home now worth $ 150,000 , you might be better off buying another house in the $ 200,000 price range . That home might be newer , more functional , have better insulation and mechanical systems , and have greater potential for future appreciation . Consider the possibility that this may not be the last time you remodel . If you contemplate changes to accommodate a new lifestyle or changing family situation , is your house sufficiently adaptable ? Do you have the space for further changes ? Should you take steps now , if you decide to remodel , that can help you cut corners for future alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law before you proceed to remodel . Easements , zoning laws and building codes often influence what you can do . It 's best to learn about them in advance . <p> Besides educating themselves on the potential returns for renovating a home , owners and bargain-hunting buyers also need to guard against underestimating costs , advises Baird . <p> He offers this general advice : The house should be structurally suitable for what you have in mind . You may have visions of tearing out walls here , putting windows there , rearranging plumbing , etc . <p> " Before you start anything of a major nature , hire an architect or consulting engineer to review your plans and determine if the house is suitable for such adaptation , " said Baird . For example , an expert may discover that supporting beams are not in the right place for alterations you plan , or that additional supports are necessary , adding to the cost . Get an expert 's estimate of the cost of the changes you envision . Remodeling experts observe that most homeowners ' intuitive estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . Be prepared for surprises . For example , it is not uncommon to plan replacing just a portion of the plumbing , and then find that you have to replace it all . Also , when you begin tearing down walls you may discover structural defects that must be corrected . There are few remodeling projects that pay off dollar-for-dollar in the short term . <p> And the newly remodeled home must fit the location , a prime reason for many sales . A rule of thumb applied by both real estate brokers and remodelers is that an improvement that brings a home to the level of similar houses in the neighborhood is a good one . Going beyond that can be financially risky . <p> " Catching up with other houses in the area can be cost effective , but overbuilding for an area can be personally costly , " said Bongi . <p> Homeowners who are concerned mostly with recovering the cost of improvements should limit the investment in remodeling or expansion to no more than 25 percent to 30 percent of the present value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home five years after the remodeling or home improvement job is completed , he or she should expect to recoup a good part of the investment . However , the cost of remodeling projects completed this year often ca n't be recouped until next year . <p> Remodeling needs time to appreciate , too . <p> Don DeBat is the Chicago Sun-Times ' assistant managing editor for residential and commercial development .
