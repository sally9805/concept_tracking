1899 <p> ITTLE REGGIE TODDLED over lawns of the Frost estate with his nanny traipsing along , blowing bubbles . She 'd been given the double charge of laundering clothes and keeping mind of the boy , while her master attended important business , not to be disturbed , many important gentlemen , the advancement of science , the glory of Britannia and preservation of her Majesty 's military supremacy . The nanny had bored of washing clothes . She drifted from her chore , ostensibly to give Reggie a breath of fresh air . With a scoop of soapwater she blew bubbles for him to chase , and she blew them toward the gentlemen 's racket . <p> And what a sight for them both having crested a knoll , cultured greens of grass interrupted by verticals of gentlemen in suits , her master Edward Frost included , all of them standing in calm observance , multiplying the verticals of trees , elms , asps , cedar , and the immense oak where attention was concentrated . And what an age we were entering , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , startled by visions as dreamlike as a child 's , as the nanny stopped now , her lips pursed to blow a bubble . <p> A steam engine clamored on the lawn , pitmans rising from its back to a second contraption suspended from the oak , a machine that extended great black wings , great flapping black wings , feathered like a bird 's but of a span and girth that bespoke the size of the dreams of the men who 'd made them - yes , made them , because even a girl like her with no education to speak of could see that the beating of the wings depended on the steamdriven strokes from below . <p> The core of a great mechanical bird ? Was that what they had built ? Was she dreaming ? <p> Little Reggie swayed , unsteady , staring at the contraption , close enough to feel the air rolling from its efforts . <p> And the gentlemen in suits , they stared at the winged mechanism , withholding comment . <p> Everyone was dreaming . It was an age of dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of dreams come true . 1902 <p> Man was meant to fly : that much the Royal Aeronautical Society agreed upon . The issue of debate was simply , by what means ? <p> Opinion shifted with the performance of prototypes built in England and on the continent , but lately the RAS had leaned toward the idea of a fixed-wing flier . Sir George Cayley began and ended his pioneering career in the study of flight with the concept of a craft bearing fixed wings , its propulsive force coming from a separate source : this was called an aeroplane , and impressive results by fixed-wing gliders had recently swayed RAS members toward such designs . <p> But Edward Frost knew better . <p> Man was meant to fly , yes . But would man be so foolish as to ignore the example God had given him ? Birds , beautiful birds - the Society should follow their splendid example , Edward knew , and build an ornithopter , with propulsion deriving from the wings . He spent much time watching birds in flight but lately he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward ? " <p> " Yes of course , cherie . " <p> " I have n't asked you anything yet . " " No , cherie , of course you have n't . " <p> " The iceman gave me a vulgar look this morning . " <p> " I 'll have a word with him . " <p> " He left his boots on when he came inside the house . He did n't make an effort , even , to first clean off the mud . " <p> " The cur . I 'll give him a good talking to . " <p> " I was very shocked , Edward . I stood with my jaw dropped and I glared at him . And do you know ? He looked right back at me ! He gave me an immodest look . " <p> " He forgot his place . You poor dear . " <p> " Why would he behave this way , Edward ? Why would he look at me this way ? " <p> " The cur . A good talking-to . I 'll set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over an iceman , to behave in such a way ? Why did he give me such a look ? " <p> " Because you 're French , cherie . He thinks he can take liberties with a French woman . " <p> " Oh . Oh . " <p> Chantel looked down ; she smoothed the pages of Aesop 's Fables , which she 'd been reading to Reggie . Edward hoped she could not see him flush in the window 's reflection . A lie was acceptable if it should spare someone 's feelings , but he had chosen his lie badly , insulting her heritage , and he could only justify doing so with the knowledge he was protecting her from much larger pains , real threats , griefs more tangible than the impudent glances of servicemen . <p> " Reggie , " Edward said . " Come stand with your father . " The boy arched his back to pour himself from his mother 's lap . Reggie stood only as tall as the window sill , and so Edward scooped him up and stood him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky and shapes swooping against twilight purple . The boy lifted his hand to point at them , their flight bringing a smile to his face . <p> " Yes , " Edward said quietly . " Birds . And nobody questions their wealth , do they ? No sum of money could rival the gift of flight . " <p> 1903 <p> Members of the Royal Aeronautical Society had returned to the Frost estate . They stood on the hillside with their arms behind their backs , watching without comment . <p> Down the slope ran a set of tracks like those crisscrossing the nation , although it was no locomotive waiting to hurtle down their length . On the hilltop sat a more fanciful machine , Ornithopter Number Three , the product of heavy mental , physical , and financial investment , the fulcrum upon which these very grounds had been leveraged , the culmination of years of work and countless dreams of escaping Earthly encumbrances . And to think it could all be delayed by one reluctant driver ! Edward tried to keep a level tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chair . " Harry , be reasonable . " <p> " But sir- " <p> " Really , Harry , I must insist . " <p> " Sir , you pay me to drive horses , not flying machines ! " " We 've discussed your qualifications , Harry . You need do nothing more than sit in that sling and provide ballast ; I think that 's within your capabilities . Let 's not keep the good people waiting any longer , shall we ? " <p> Harry peered past his employer 's shoulder at the distinguished guests standing over the hillside , some knighted , one a Windsor . He swallowed . He nodded . Mister Frost was right . The event was bigger than his misgivings , and Harry could n't bear the thought of keeping distinguished men waiting for his cowardice . Edward leaned over and fastened the canvas belt across Harry 's waist . <p> Ornithopter Three was a vision  --  enough to stifle even the most vocal skeptics , if only briefly . The chassis was a simple upright framework of tubes on wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nervous driver , the frame supported its motive faculty , a gunpowder engine based on the model by Trouve , but even this was not the craft 's most impressive aspect . <p> The wings spanned almost twenty feet and looked like something borne of mythology . Frost and sympathetic members of the Society had spent countless hours attaching duck feathers to the cambered frames , which were hinged in the middle and connected to the engine by coiled Bourdon tubes . The engine fired blank gun cartridges against the tubes , hyper-extending them , and so causing the wings to flap downward . After this brief explosion , the tubes would relax enough to bring the wings up again , as the next cartridge fell into place . Frost distributed wads of cotton batting to his assistants and Harry , who reluctantly stuffed his ears , then returned to gripping the frame like a prisoner . <p> The assistants removed and folded their jackets . Edward retreated to a good vantage . He 'd planned to make notes on the Ornithopter 's performance but realized a full sentence would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single word . Success or failure . <p> He signaled the assistants . <p> They started pushing the Ornithopter down the tracks , for an initial burst of speed . When they had covered a third the distance , one of them triggered the engine : it erupted with a gatling-gun racket , and Harry jumped at the noise . But attention drew quickly to the wings , the great wings , working as they had been designed to work , pumping up and down , spreading breadth against the invisible ocean of air , flapping , flapping , flapping <p> The men pushed Ornithopter Three until it got out of their grasp , pulling ahead of them , and Edward Frost could see his machine fight gravity , battling for buoyancy , struggling to rise . Further encouragement awaited at the terminus of the tracks , a ramp that would shoot the craft skyward . Gulls had been wheeling about earlier and Edward 's mind sprang on a tangent , wondering if the Omithopter would burst through their number , surprising them .... <p> The craft shot off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued pumping but the Ornithopter did not ascend beyond a mere inertial arc , hitting the ground , hard , lifting again briefly , not flying but bouncing , at best leaping , a sort of industrial hopping , punctuated madly across many yards . Men scattered . Edward felt himself dropping even though he remained standing . His pencil and ledger became heavy , too heavy , subject to an unfair share of gravity , as he watched his great design flounder , and it did resemble a bird , but a bird attempting to toss debris off its talons , or perhaps kill prey in an unconventional smashing manner . <p> The assistants found their jackets . Other finely dressed observers did not react outwardly , they remained fixed in place , as if this scene was fully expected ; they put forward no dismay or disappointment or smug pleasure , because they were too embarrassed or too courteous or too aloof for such comments . What they watched - still firing gunpowder in staccato snorts-was the failure of Edward Purkis Frost . The ruin . Not all the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bankers . Money lenders . Men with a financial stake in the day 's results . <p> Other men , too . Uninvited . They kept back from the crowd so as not to draw attention . Unknown to Edward , these strangers also would influence his future , but for now they stood silent , while Ornithopter Three bounced over the grounds , shedding feathers , making a gaudy show of Edward 's downfall , while Harry , still strapped aboard , fought to shout out , <p> " Sir ... I ... respectfully ... resign ... my ... services ! " <p> Months passed . <p> The image of Omithopter Three hopping to its demise tainted Edward 's world-view , not least of all his feelings toward birds . He stood at the drawing room window and shuddered at the sight of a pigeon flying to the coop . <p> He trudged through the snow and found the landed pigeon strutting back and forth . Edward reached inside and untied the small piece of paper rolled around its leg . The note was from London , from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the spare paragraph written here was perhaps the worst yet . <p> Americans report 12-second flight . First in history in which machine carries a man and is raised by its own power into the air - no reduction of speed , landed at a point as high as that from which it started . Wilbur and Orville Wright , Flyer No. 1 . <p> Fixed wing . <p> Fixed wing . <p> The size of the note allowed for no more details . But this was enough . Fixed-wing fliers had triumphed . The Ornithopter , Edward realized , would amount to nothing more than a footnote in the history of aviation , an entry small enough to fit around a pigeon 's leg . <p> 1906 <p> Edward developed a near-phobia of pigeons . A pigeon returned to his coop , and he learned he 'd lost his position as President of the Society . A pigeon , and he was warned of legal maneuvers by creditors . A pigeon , and the Crown relieved him of his position as magistrate . <p> How could his situation be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October afternoon , two strangers came to the estate , and Edward took the timing of their arrival as bad portent . It was the same afternoon bailiffs came to seize assets , a burly pair of dullards lugging the wing of an omithopter to their wagon ; watching the wing go , Edward noticed the coach pull up , and two men disembark . Unlike the bailiffs , these men were slight , even timid , their heads downturned , apparently embarrassed by the scene in the middle of which they found themselves . They wore English suits and these seemed awkward on the strangers because , Edward realized , they were Oriental . <p> Perplexed , he crossed the lawn to meet them , expecting bows , but the Orientals extended their hands simultaneously . <p> " Very pleased to meet your acquaintance , Mister Edward Frost . " Their names were Toru and Hiroto , but if these were too challenging Edward was welcome to call them Tommy and Henry . Edward could not differentiate them beyond the color of their suits and the fact one thrust out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enthusiasts of your work , on behalf of our master and employer , Okura Shuko Kan . " " My work ? " <p> " Omithopters . Our master , very interested in your success . " " News of my ' success ' seems to have been skewed in translation . " The two men blushed . " We were attending , for the test flight . " " You were here ? You witnessed the fiasco ? " <p> " We suggest , Edward Frost , this was not fiasco , to us . " Edward could no longer withhold the question . " Why are you here ? " " Our master , Okura Shuko Kan , he very interested in machinepowered flight . In replicating the flight of birds . " <p> " You 'll pardon me for smiling but I do n't think any Chinaman will have better luck than I. Your race lags too far behind in technology and industry , I 'm afraid , to achieve powered flight . " <p> The pair colored , paused before speaking again . " Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it does n't change my point , does it ? You have n't the grasp of modern sciences . I might do your master a favor and recommend he avoid the expense and humiliation I have suffered for my ambition . Good day , sirs , you 've added an amusing note to a rather dreary day . " <p> Edward offered his hand . One of the men stuck out his chest , said , " Tsar Nicholas would disagree , I think . " " Tsar Nicholas ? " <p> " He would disagree I think about the Japanese lagging . In industry . In technology . " <p> A sound point . Schools of fish no doubt circulated through the Russian fleet right now , somewhere along the sea floor . The Japs had won the Russo-Japanese War decisively , and Edward found himself reconsidering the pair who stood before him . It was " Tommy " who had spoken out , demonstrated some backbone after all that blushing and deference . Edward gave them a second look , and noted that however out-of-place their suits looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased from a Hyde street haberdashery . In a word , expensive . " Do you people care for tea ? " They blushed . <p> Inside the house , Hiroto and Toru halted abruptly . They had returned to their carriage briefly before coming to the door , and carried between them what appeared to be a large valise fashioned from hardwood . " Do n't trouble with your shoes , " Edward said , as they stood , stopped . <p> But what stopped them was a line chalked along the floor , down the hallway , into rooms , dividing the house , and the fact Edward kept to one side of this border . They avoided looking at the chalk-line . " My wife and I have , ahem , drawn up this arrangement , until a more permanent solution is effected . " Despite his assurances that guests need not acknowledge the chalk division , the two men nonetheless kept to Edward 's side . <p> " Please forgive the mess , " he said . " An inventor 's weakness . " In fact he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true explanation for the half-completed prototype wings and piles of unbound documents in the drawing room was that he hoped to conceal heirlooms from the bailiffs . " If you can find a place to sit , I 'll have the housekeeper prepare tea . " <p> The men set their case on the floor and knelt to snap open buckles . The nanny and the housekeeper and the driver had all left long ago , and Edward himself had to produce tea and biscuits , and find a clean pot , and when he returned to the drawing room with the fruit of his efforts he almost dropped the works . <p> " I hope Darjeeling is - oh . Good Lord . " <p> The Japanese had removed tissue packing and now gently lifted from their case a set of wings - immaculate white wings , extending from a bamboo body . A model , and a superb model at that , gorgeous , and his heart , his heart performed a maneuver when he saw Toru wind an elastic running through the interior . Hiroto looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod . <p> With each wind , tension increased through the model , mirroring his own mounting excitement . Was he even breathing ? And then the Japanese launched the model , sending it into the air with a gentle toss , and it stayed aloft , its wings flapped with exact strokes and it climbed , it rose , and Edward felt air thumping his face as he followed the flight of the ornithopter around the room , soaring above the tables , lamps , climbing higher , winging toward the ceiling as he turned and turned with its spiraling ascent . <p> " Dear God .... " <p> " We would like to work with you , Mister Edward Frost . " " Dear God in Heaven .... " " A partnership . " <p> But he was unable to register what the Oriental was saying until the elastic energy had run its course and one of them darted forward to catch the model . Edward wanted to see it fly again . He wanted to examine the underpinnings of the wings , the action . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I had met you years ago , " he said . " Your timing , I 'm afraid , is abysmal . Any new endeavors would be interrupted by my previous failures . Look outside ! My creditors are everywhere . I 'm ashamed to admit that I can no longer provide the right environment for aeronautical study . " <p> The men glanced at one another . " We would not impose on your estate , " said Hiroto . " We know of your difficulties , " Toru continued . " We invite you to Meboso . " " Meboso ... ? " <p> " A small village , on Honshu . We think you would find agreeable the terms our master presents . " " Honshu .. Japan ? " <p> " We will happily provide , if you will allow , passage for two . " " I ... my wife wo n't accompany me anywhere . Especially not the Far East ! " The Japanese colored . " We were thinking , the boy ? " And Edward turned to see young Reggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration too , because he looked much like Edward felt , a child with dreams freshly teased . 1908 <p> Edward sat on a cedar bench , crickets making music in the dusk . He was surprised to find his palms sweaty . Why should he be nervous to meet any man ? <p> Before relocating to Japan , the notion of rich Orientals had never occurred to him . But time spent in Meboso forced him to appreciate this idea , to cultivate a respect for the wealth commanded by the Shuko Kan zaibatsu . Meboso was situated in a valley pegged by four hills of roughly equal size , and the symmetry of the setting seemed to please its inhabitants , as this feature had been pointed out to Edward on more than one occasion . The valley was mostly rice fields and a smattering of homes , rickshaws or wagons occasionally clattering between . On one hillside a great kiln could be seen , where potters from Meboso and other villages came to fire their wares . Edward could see it best after dusk , glowing heart occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quaint Meboso , resources came , no matter how scarce , how expensive , they came . When he requested a Daimler-Benz motorcar , it was delivered within four days , and in the interval , farmers pulled a plow , breaking ground for the track around which the vehicle would be driven . The estate in which he lived was owned by the Shuko Kan zaibatsu , and the village seemed subservient to it in a sense Edward did n't quite grasp , a relationship both feudal and commercial . <p> The quality of the English spoken by many locals was another surprise . He 'd worried about bringing Reggie here for an extended period , but those fears were quelled when he met the men who would serve as tutors , introducing themselves with a better command of the language than some Society members , back home . <p> And he found personalities in these people , underneath their courtesy and similar aspects . Hiroto and Toru were nephews of the master , Okura Shuko Kan ; they were cousins , dissimilar . Hiroto was contemplative , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descent of a crane . Toru was the one who spoke with his chest out , the one who voiced occasional fiery opinion of world politics , of Japanese prowess , of sunken Russian ships . The two competed for influence over Edward and the ornithopter 's development - they seemed rivals , yet he never heard one speak badly of the other . Such politeness ! But what should you expect from a race that lived within paper walls ? <p> He sat in one of the " gardens " within the estate , catching scents of tree sap and plum blossom . Wondering why he was nervous . Why ? Everyone treated him with respect . He wiped his palms . He tried to calm himself by staring at patterns raked into gravel . A cane tapped the path . <p> He wiped his hands on his pants once more as the small man materialized from darkness . However diminutive , Okura Shuko Kan could , with a word , stop or start any venture in Meboso . He did not look like a magnate . Wiry hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eyes ; the other seemed to wander . He looked like he might have been a sickly child . " I 've heard your name so often , " said Edward . " It 's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance . " " I too have heard much of you . " <p> They sat . Bat song accompanied the crickets , and Okura looked skyward with his clear eye . " I am told , " he said , " that you and Hiroto wish to build a full-size prototype ? " <p> " Yes . Expanding on your ideas , of course . I think our concept is quite feasible . " <p> Okura nodded , one eye bright . <p> " An adaptation of the Daimler-Benz engine , " Edward continued . " I ca n't take all the credit . My challenge was linking Bourdon tubes to an internal combustion engine , without reduction by differential gears . You 've seen how Hiroto and I incorporated the Bourdon tubes within your wing design ? The crankshaft of the engine compresses and releases them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to your study of wing dynamics . If we can build a working prototype , it will be a tremendous accomplishment . I believe it 's an achievable goal , with a modem shop available to us . " <p> " You shall have it , " the other man said . Edward exhaled , realizing now why he had been worried . " Excellent . Truly , this is a capital development for manned flight . We wo n't disappoint you ! " <p> " But it 's too noisy . " Edward paused . " I beg your pardon ? " " Too noisy . Your engine . " <p> " Mister Kan ... what makes you say that ? We have n't even started - " " I 've seen the motorcar on the track . I have heard it . I can not help but hear it . " He frowned as if he 'd tasted a lemon . <p> " With all due respect , " Edward said , " please understand that the amount of lift necessary to overcome the gravity acting on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried every conceivable type of fuel , gunpowder , compressed air , alcohol-fueled boilers , carbolic acid-nothing compares with petrol ! No energy source exists with the same potential . " <p> " What does a bird sound like , rising from a branch ? " When Edward said nothing , Okura replied , " Correct . No motor sound . What would a forest be , if filled with the racket of your DaimlerBenz ? I think it would not be a forest . " <p> " But nothing can compare with petrol .... " The frail man pulled himself up by the cane and turned back down the path . " Your prototype will be built , " he said . " But until we eliminate the noise of the engine , we wo n't have succeeded . " Okura Shuko Kan left Edward in the dark , very much in the dark . Disappointment mingled with frustration . Was the man daft ? They were on the verge , here , of fulfilling Edward 's dream , of making history , and Kan was concerned about the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was oft the case with visionaries , and Edward resolved not to let any madness impede man 's conquest of the skies on flapping wings . <p> 1909 <p> Reggie had put on a kimono . Today was perhaps the most important day of Edward 's career , and his twelve-year-old son chose to wear a yellow silk gown embroidered with lilies . Edward stomped in another room and the boy was still wearing the kimono . Edward slammed a cupboard door , he harrumphed and glared , yet the kimono continued to exist ! The boy must be deliberately trying to aggravate him . Kimono . Even the word was infuriating . <p> The issue had arisen before , Reggie answering Edward 's questions in Japanese , or practicing calligraphy when he should have been studying scripture , or eating roast lamb with chopsticks , or spending his leisure time in the stone garden with a rake and non-Christian philosophies . Once , in frustration , Edward had decreed that the boy should wipe his mind clean of the Japanese language , but this seemed as difficult to enforce as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the boy kneeling to tea in the next room wearing what amounted to a yellow silk dress . He knew not what to do . To say . His son . His child . <p> His little Japanese boy . <p> Outside , a ruckus . Shouts . <p> It had been so long since Edward heard a voice raised in anger ( other than his own ) that it drew him to the window . This was a Japanese language he had not previously experienced , one transformed by volume , by emotion , and more surprising still , he knew the two young men shouting , the nephews Hiroto and Toru , down in the courtyard , shoving , their faces so flush with anger that they too were difficult to recognize . Shoves got harder , onlookers gathered , men in leather aprons emerging from the machine shop . Toru snatched a bamboo training sword , the kind used in kendo classes , and swung at his cousin , striking bare flesh with an awful smack . Hiroto dove into the crowd and emerged moments later with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the traditional manner and clashed in bursts . For a change Edward found himself blushing at the Japanese . He lowered the blinds , turned . <p> Reggie stood in the room . Still wearing his kimono . Edward knew what he must say . <p> " Change . " <p> " Father ? ' <p> " You wo n't be going to the launch . Not dressed in that fashion . " " But everyone will be dressed formally . " <p> " Yes , but we are a different race , and we must n't forget that , Reggie . We must show the Japanese what we are , so they too remember . " " But this is what I want to wear . " Reggie seldom whined or scowled ; he was too reasonable . " It 's what I like . It 's comfortable . " <p> " Lucky thing a corset is uncomfortable , or I suppose I 'd find one under that dress ! No . You will change into proper English clothes , and that 's the last word on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all . I 'll tell Shimbo to take you to the ocean instead . You will spend the day reading scripture . Reciting Exodus , over the noise of the surf . " <p> The boy stood , taking on the slightest hue . Edward could see him trying to think a way through this disagreement . The boy cocked his head , to the window , to the shouts outside , the ongoing shouts , clattering parries . <p> " Should n't you be flying the ornithopter , Father ? " " What does that have to do with anything ? " " It 's your dream , are n't you always saying ? The omithopter is your dream . " <p> " The lads have more practical experience - " " Why would n't you want to fly your own machine ? " " Ah . Now I understand . You 're getting back at me . " " Father , is it because you 're scared ? " " Scared ! " <p> He caught himself before answering , before launching into an explanation that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidelines . It would sound too much like an excuse . " Go get changed , " he said instead . <p> And Reggie turned and walked quietly to his room . Scared . What did a boy know about being scared ? Edward watched him go . <p> Change , he thought . Change . <p> Later , they stood at the airfield with zaibatsu members . Shuko Kan family members had come to watch from afar , everyone aware of what was happening and everyone displaying humble anxiety . Not in attendance was Okura Shuko Kan , although perhaps he watched from one of the recently constructed towers . A Shinto priest performed a ritual , chasing demons from the airfield . <p> Hiroto arrived . His face was bruised from the fight and he appeared profoundly humble . Why does n't he come stand with us ? It must be humiliation , Edward decided . He must have lost the fight . A roar of engine , and all faces turned to Ornithopter Four . It was built largely of bamboo - a material the Japanese could manipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven basket , or a bird 's nest . Toru wore a handmade flightsuit of crimson silk , and he bowed to various points in the crowd before climbing inside . Edward glanced at Hiroto , with a realization : the cousins had fought over which of them would take the test fight . It meant so much to them that they had taken up weapons . They had come to blows over the privilege . Edward swallowed dryly . <p> The engine snorted , and wings flapped . Edward 's prototypes back home had flapped with a simple up-down motion , replaced here with the dynamics Okura Shuko Kan had captured , every stroke combining several avian motions , primary feathers turning with upstrokes , the whole framework contracting and expanding . Edward 's versions were crude monsters by comparison ; this was an achievement worthy of men and birds , majestic wings now pulling the craft forward , without assistance . The crowd murmured , excitement growing as the craft left the ground , carriage leaving the wheels behind . The omo rose , it flew , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steady . Toru was flying . Twenty or thirty feet over the heads of the crowd and still climbing into the sky . <p> Edward could feel the crowd 's admiration . Should it be me ? Maybe that was the crux of the Wrights ' success , maybe that was why a pair of American bicycle-builders had surpassed the Royal Aeronautical Society , because they flew their crafts themselves , lying prone in their own creations , flying , as it was noted , by the seat of their pants . Perhaps a man could never succeed unless he valued his dream as highly as his life . <p> Edward refocused on the ornithopter as the crowd cheered it on , flying over the valley and toward the mountains , before Toru applied the wingwarping controls , turning the craft . Another swell of enthusiasm , as Ornithopter Four flapped back . A triumph . The craft passed above the crowd , wings moving in beautiful strokes , flying over homes and pagodas and towers of the keep , and the crowd still cheering , even when they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear him for the engine - and flames spread from there , fuselage burning and Toru struggling for control while also beating at a fire . The crowd continued to cheer even though the flight became erratic and the ornithopter did tight orbits above the keep , one wing burning , one flapping , burning wing , bird on fire , the craft spiraling into a tower , flight arrested but fiery wings still flapping as the craft toppled back , plunged , smearing flames to the ground . <p> The noise of the crowd changed . People ran toward the crash . Edward stood frozen a moment , and glanced at Reggie , standing straight in his proper English outfit , looking up at his father now with a gaze that said , This is why you should have been flying your own dream . Edward broke into a run . <p> 1910 - 1918 <p> He would no longer shy from problems , mechanical or personal . The sublime debut of the Japanese omithopter-rising so gloriously , crashing so spectacularly  --  recharged both him and Hiroto , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " privilege " of testing the craft . Toru had been transported to a northern island for convalescence , while Edward and Hiroto toiled at designs that would better shield the pilot from petrol 's demonic power . They also better harmonized the crankshaft with wing motion , and added " tail feathers " to parallel the cruciform tail unit which had helped stabilize fixed-wing fliers of the West . Edward and his team had completed six more omithopters before the first significant slowdown . <p> With the Great War 's approach , the zaibatsu shifted resources to naval endeavors . Edward , however , saw a way that the situation in Europe might benefit the omithopter . And himself . Would n't it serve the Royal Air Force well ? And if Japan 's British allies were sold on the craft , would n't that make a profitable situation for the zaibatsu ? <p> Paved roads replaced their dirt predecessors in Meboso while he strategized . The airfield was expanded and improved , with an accompanying hangar , so principles of assembly line production might be applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests to the zaibatsu , Edward penned letters to the RAF and former colleagues in the Aeronautical Society , urging them to arrange for a demonstration of " the first machine capable of true flight . " <p> His early letters were ignored , much to his irritation . It was n't just the ornithopter Edward wished to take home . As Reggie had entered his late teens , the rift between them had grown deeper than puberty itself . Reggie was never disrespectful or impertinent ; that might have been a relief . Rather , he rebelled with quietness , with grace , with understatement : he was behaving , to his father 's distress , more and more like a perfect young Japanese man . The final straw had been a romantic dalliance with one of the zaibatsu granddaughters , and after intervening Edward had formulated a plan : he would take Reggie back to England and leave him in the care of his uncle , a Cambridge professor who had agreed to oversee the boy 's admission at Hughes Hall and his education as a man , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? It would mean very much to me . " Reggie looked up from calligraphy . " England ? " <p> " The RAF has asked for a demonstration of the ornithopter . For the war . I 'm going , and Hiroto . It 'll be an adventure , and ... an education . You can see where you were born ; surely you must be curious ? " " How long would we be gone ? " <p> " Oh . A few months . Maybe more . " <p> The boy accepted the idea as placidly as a pond accepting a stone ; moments later the subject disappeared from his face . They would go . And Edward had plenty of time to break the news . <p> The voyage seemed interminable . While the crew worried about German submersibles rising from the depths , Edward struggled for the right way to tell Reggie that he must stay in England . Their frigate joined a convoy returning from the Dardanelles for the final leg , and Edward decided to wait until they arrived ; telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solid ground would make the proposition appealing . When Reggie saw the majesty of England , he would love the idea of staying . <p> Across the Channel they could hear a boom boom boom , the sounds of artillery , mortars , sounds of war that had chilled him repeatedly . They docked in Folkestone on February Third , 1916 . He thought of his fellow countrymen waiting for them on the airfield in Lympne . Here people had been making sacrifices , while he had been isolated , even pampered , a world away . From his trunk he removed a crisp suit , one he had reserved for this day . He dressed with pride , then went to the cabin where the Japanese were staying . <p> " I 'll fly the omo today . " <p> The zaibatsu members and mechanics looked at him , silent for a moment , stunned , before raising a general protest . The man scheduled to pilot the craft complained loudest , but Hiroto interceded . <p> " This is Edward 's homeland , " Hiroto said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and nodded . He understood , it seemed . He could make the others understand . They agreed that after meeting the RAF representative here in Folkestone , Edward would depart , launching from the deck and flying to the airfield . An appropriately dramatic debut . <p> They went up as a group to perform a final check on the aircraft and this was where dreams again crashed back to earth , because in the morning sun , the bright mist and familiar smells of seashore , the deck was empty , except for one startled crew member and the wrappings under which the ornithopter had been stored . <p> Gone . <p> " Germans ... " Edward breathed . " We 've been sabotaged ! " But the guard shook his head , no . " Your son . Such a good boy . " " Reg ... ? " <p> " Your son . He told me he was to test engine . " " Reggie ... ? " <p> " Testing engine , he told me . " <p> " It 's not possible .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bindings which had tied it in place . " .. what did he ... I " " He flew . He said nothing to me . " <p> " Edward , we must inform the commanders in Lympne , " Hiroto said quickly . <p> But awful things were dawning on Edward , and he said , " Reggie did n't fly toward Lympne . Did he ? " The guard shook his head . " East . " " East ? " said Hiroto . " Over the water ? " <p> " But why ? " said one of the others . " To France ? " Edward looked into the sky as he felt control slipping out of his grasp , he felt the sun , he felt everything falling apart . A person could fall without having risen . Plans could come apart like loose feathers , fluttering away like hopes and ambitions until you were left in the air without means of support . <p> From another vantage , those same blocks of sunlight and cloud seemed anything but despairing . <p> Reggie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel ! This was not the first time he had piloted an ornithopter , but it was the first time anyone had attempted to cross this body of water by orno . And he would make it . He would . The carriage was so narrow that the omo 's ribs cradled him , and he could feel the essential motion through the framework , compressing him , releasing him : the wings were his own . On both forearms he wore leather braces connected to cables which warped the wings , furthering the sense of integration . He could , pulling or twisting or by a combination of both , change the rate of wingflap , or alter the inclination of either wing . <p> He was immersed . And he could look down to the green ocean below , peeling with waves . Between him and the water , gulls wheeled , oblivious to his presence , accepting it . Mist broke across the carriage as the wings beat strongly , smoothly , pulling him through the sky . He would make it . <p> It had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father wanted him in England for personal reasons , for English reasons , and as Reggie had watched the mechanics tinkering with the omo , the realization had struck him . He must see his mother . She would understand him . Reggie would find her , and they would protect one another , and after the war Reggie would return to Japan , alone . <p> He had not corresponded with his mother in ten years . A minor detail . Compared to a young man flying over the Channel ? It was the smallest of minor details . Ahead , coastline materialized , and the orno pulled over land , and the land resolved beneath him , gloomy and scary and pocked by war . <p> What had he expected ? Something other than the haunted field below , burned trees with blackened branches fracturing the mist , and pools of water collected in depressions of unknown origin . Bomb-bursts perhaps , or the movements of heavy artillery . There was nobody below , a few farmhouses and outbuildings , but all was deserted , bleak . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a giant scavenger , or a harbinger of future nightmares . <p> Then , an unfamiliar sound . <p> A motorized buzzing , somewhere behind him . He tried to look but the carriage allowed minimal movement , and the sound grew into a cylindered whine , and he saw two biplanes , fixed-wing , zooming in on him . They approached with astounding velocity , one dogging the other , passing him , and his chest clutched his heart . He 'd never seen a fixed-wing plane in flight-and while in flight himself ! They zipped ahead , and his first fear , that they were German , was relieved with a flash of livery over the tail-fins , blue , white and red indicating these were British aircraft , Sopwith Camels . In the blur of motion he 'd also glimpsed the pilots turning their heads , looking in his direction , obviously startled . <p> They had never seen an omithopter before . As the biplanes receded , Reggie wondered how his father and the Shuko Kan zaibatsu hoped to compete with these machines : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such packaged fury . He stared , spellbound . <p> And then ... what ? <p> Far ahead , the aeroplanes banked . Turning . <p> Coming back at him . <p> The pilots had never seen an ornithopter before . And no markings were emblazoned over it , no indications of origin ; his father had requested this be so . No sign of nationality . <p> Another sound cut through the engine noise . Brappp ... brapp .... Gunfire . <p> Reggie yanked his warping cables , reducing lift on the right wing and so turning the omithopter hard in that direction . It performed a tight descending circle , blood rushing into his head . The Sopwiths fired into the place where he had been and zipped above . He looked up , saw them climbing , rolling . Turning themselves for another run . He had a few moments before they descended to his level . <p> Reggie increased the wingflap and warped into an ascent only a few degrees off the vertical : his rapid climb confounded the biplanes ' attack . They fired into empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beat as fast as his wings . How could he signal that he was an ally ? How could he save himself ? If only the pilots could hear his father - he was British , for the love of God ! <p> But there would be no communication between them , not over the drone of engines . If he was to survive this episode he would have to pioneer an art , right now , right here , the art of combat between flapping and fixedwing aircraft . The omo lacked guns , but perhaps hope existed in those long , luxurious turns the biplanes made . He countered with the orno 's ability to rise or fall swiftly , letting the Sopwiths commit to a line of flight just before he dropped or jumped out of it . This worked for three more runs before the British pilots worked out a counterstrategy , one staying high , the other low , waiting for the other to flush Reggie into a line of fire . One more peal of machine-gun fire sent feathers flying , and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was terribly dry , and he believed it now . <p> They would kill him . <p> He tried to clear his mind of distracting thoughts . What did he have that they did not ? What about the oreo could save him ? <p> He descended , decreasing the wingflap , slowing further as the Sopwiths zigged and zagged with the persistence of mosquitoes . They had speed , the omo had slowness . He dropped again , until he flew less than thirty feet over the ground , slow as he could manage , rising and falling with the landscape . A lone cow galloped at the sight of him . The Sopwiths made runs overhead , firing in bursts before they were forced to pull up and bank . Reggie headed for trees . The orno was flying slowly , so slow , great wings beating , a bird , entering the forest . Starlings burst . He swooped under branches , bounced off the ground , banked to avoid a trunk and rose again through boughs and branches . He was flying through forest . Branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The biplanes persisted . They made further extravagant runs , pouring ammunition down , and he was showered with leaves and branch-parts and feathers . The second major strike against a wing , he knew the fight was over . The omo could no longer flap enough to stay aloft , he hit the ground , bounding , once , twice , and the third leap threw the craft into a tree for a jarring halt . <p> He pulled himself out of the cockpit , the wreck still limply beating its wings . He fell , got up . The sound of the fighters was the voice of mechanized death . His heart pounding , he staggered back from the omo , stumbled . Overhead the Sopwiths continued their runs , shooting where he 'd crashed - the pilots must have thought he was still inside , and he ran , he ran , and they strafed the trees , leaves and branches falling on either side of him , in front of him , he changed directions , jangled , confused , nowhere to go as they hacked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1920-1930 <p> Edward was startled to see the young Japanese woman at his door . " This is a surprise , " he said . " Wo n't you come in ? " Her name was Asa Tokugawa and she was related to Okura Shuko Kan , just as everyone in Meboso seemed to be related at least by marriage to the master . Edward and Asa had never spoken before , although he 'd given the girl much thought . <p> Edward offered her tea , but she declined . He was n't sure what to say . " Should n't you be busy with ... preparations ? " " Most everything is ready . I need only to speak to you . " " By all means . " <p> " Your son , he very dear to me . You believe that , yes ? " " I have decided to attend the wedding tomorrow you need n't convince me . " <p> " I am glad you will attend our wedding , Mister Frost , very glad . What I hoped was that you might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blessing even , and good wishes . " He sighed . " Oh , dear . My dear girl . " <p> " Do you object to us as a people ? We Japanese ? " " No ! That 's not it at all ! I think yours is a grand race , and I 'm proud of what your uncles and I have achieved . Nevertheless . Some things do n't change . It 's simply not right for a British man to marry a Japanese woman . " <p> Her eyes flashed . <p> " It 's about heritage , " Edward tried to explain . " Reggie should be proud of his heritage . Instead he looks for every opportunity to squander it , and I 'm afraid marrying you is one more attempt . That sounds terrible , I know . But a man 's nationality is a terrible thing to waste . " Asa looked hurt . <p> " I believe , " Edward continued , " that your family had similar misgivings . " At this she lifted her eyes . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Following that disastrous trip to England , Reggie returned to Japan a changed man - no longer a boy , to be sure , and those panicked moments with the Sopwiths had seeded in him an irrational and passionate hatred , not merely for Britain , but for all of Europe , all the West , and the idea of depositing him in Cambridge became suddenly ludicrous . Reggie would no longer water down his allegiance to Japan , and when he announced that he would marry Asa Tokugawa , a daughter of a cousin of Okura Shuko Kan himself , Edward realized that all his misgivings would not stand in the way . <p> But Asa 's family had been more actively opposed . The family believed it was wrong for Asa to marry outside her race , and they might have prevented a wedding , if not for one factor . <p> A fleet- or rather , flock - of twenty high-performance omithopters sat on the Shuko Kan airfield . Several had been sold to other zaibatsu , for private enjoyment of the wealthiest members of Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island to island , symbols of the better future promised by Japanese innovation . Most everyone in Japan had seen or heard of the omithopters , and public interest had fermented . With the orno 's romanticization as a Japanese technology , interest also grew in Reggie Frost and the story of his harrowing flight to France . The Japanese interpreted the incident as an example of antagonization by the West , fixed-wing gnats firing on a defenseless omo , and it was a wrong that the Japanese public wished collectively to right . Reggie became something of a folk hero for rejecting his roots and returning to become a pilot . When rumors circulated that the Shuko Kan zaibatsu wished to prevent his wedding to Asa , there was public outcry . Zaibatsu were criticized in the press for their influence over national affairs , and further bad publicity was unwelcome . In the end , Asa 's family decided it was better to yield a daughter than risk ceding any of the zaibatsu 's power . <p> " My family will see that we were right , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . " Edward forced a smile ; he could not agree . " I do wish you both well , " he said instead . " Every success , every happiness . " <p> This seemed to please Asa , and the next day , as he stood at their wedding with a Union Jack pinned to his lapel , he found himself not unhappy . Would he have been more opposed to this marriage , if he had received a warmer reception in England ? He 'd speculated that maybe he too would stay there , as a representative of the Shuko Kan ornithopter industry . But even after a successful demonstration of the aircraft , he had found his countrymen uninterested , disdainful , unable to see the omo as anything more than a gawky distraction from their fixed-wing efforts . So he had returned to Japan . <p> To Meboso . It was n't terrible . Modem buildings had replaced rice fields ; traffic was steady , and neighborhoods expanded as people moved here to take jobs in industries spurred by the ornithopter . Only one farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers . As the city grew , military zaibatsu members visited more frequently , and Edward felt a pang of nervousness whenever he saw uniformed men touring the factories . <p> They have no influence over me , he assured himself . The Japanese mood could not impede the orno. 1935 <p> It looked like a feather . It was soft . It floated to the ground like a feather if he let go . But when he held it under his nose , it smelled like ... petrol . <p> The " feather " was manmade , a homogenous product without a discrete stem or fronds , and although Edward doubted it could rival anything plucked from a goose , the ramifications were not lost on him . It would be improved . And if it could be made once , it could be made a thousand times , a million times . <p> He put the artificial feather in his pocket and went looking for Hiroto . Neither of them had requested a manmade substitute for feathers ; the goose farm was doing well , with publicity campaigns steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the materials research group had simply handed the feather to Edward . <p> On whose initiative had it been developed ? <p> Edward could n't say when , precisely , but at some point the research had slipped away from him . Materials science , engineering , wing-flap physics : by necessity these studies had been parceled to other groups . He could no longer keep abreast of advances being made in each , and he realized that although meetings between departments began with English translation , they quickly turned all-Japanese , and nobody protested , or even seemed to notice , if he slipped away before they finished . The feather was one more innovation that happened without him . He had no more control over the evolution of orno technology than he did that of Meboso itself . The rickshaws , gone . The kiln on the southern hillside was extinguished , last breath of fire sucked from its belly . Blocks of affordable housing obscured that end of the valley , and a new technical institute had arisen nearby . Even the next valley over was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he noticed towers rising from an unnamed industrial concern . <p> Maybe he did n't look up often enough from his work . <p> On the airfield more than a hundred omos sat in rows , wings folded against their hulls , awaiting purchasers . Omos flapped down to the airstrip or toward Kyoto at almost every hour of the day . Dramatic increases in the lift generated by wings meant that omos could transport supplies , or passengers . Or troops . Or armaments . Edward had seen , although not participated in the design of , an orno whose primary cargo was ammunition and a single gun of terrible caliber . National enthusiasm was developing into something bigger than Edward , bigger than the zaibatsu . Eat a goose for national security . Young boys through the islands strove to grow up on goose meat yet keep a low enough weight to make themselves ideal candidates as pilots . Contemporary Japanese architecture dictated that structures have roosts extending from their summits ; in Tokyo , omos flapped from building to building , shuttling the elite of Tokyo society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general , expanding enthusiasm that made Edward nervous , because it was linked to the growing nationalism , the fixation on Asian neighbors in rhetoric and demagoguery . <p> He found Hiroto weeping . <p> Edward considered walking on , leaving the man alone with whatever grieved him . Was n't that the polite thing to do ? Maybe . But he forced himself , instead , to sit on the bench opposite . " My hands , " said Edward . Hiroto looked up . <p> " I was never much for examining my face in the mirror , " Edward went on . " But my hands I ca n't ignore ! When did they become so old ? All cracked and bony , curled up on themselves . They look like - " " The talons of an eagle , " suggested Hiroto . They laughed . Edward indicated his eyes . " To go with my crow 's feet ! " <p> Again they laughed . <p> And then a moment of shared quiet , in which Edward did not reveal the plastic feather . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset you " Hiroto nodded . <p> " They 're getting their way , are they ! The military men . " " Everyone is military now . Except you and me . " " What about Okura Shuko Kan ? " <p> " He is ... old . He lacks the strength to resist . " Edward exhaled and leaned back . He shut his eyes , and felt overcome by a sense of defeat that had long been approaching . " So we 're out of business . The army will be commandeering the factories for tanks and munitions , I suppose . " <p> Hiroto looked at him sharply . " Oh no , " he said . " No , no . " <p> 1940 - 1948 <p> Hiroto and Edward stood apart from the crowd . The crowd cheered and even Edward felt charged by this choreographed event . The sprawling Shuko Kan shipyards made for an inspiring setting , testimony to an enormous capacity for industry . Thirty-nine omos sat on the deck of an aircraft carrier , red circles dyed into their wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view , the crowd cheered even louder , because its underside was white with a central red circle , rays of red extending through the wings . The crowd roared and waved back little flags bearing the same symbol . " The Rising Son , " said Hiroto . <p> Edward smirked . Their friendship had reached the stage where he could hear the other man 's puns . " Reg is a confident showman , " Hiroto continued . " He did n't get it from me . " <p> The omo perched momentarily on a conning tower to spread its wings and display its livery , before it hopped off and glided to the last open space below . The cockpit opened . Reggie , in flight gear , stepped out to receive one of the crowd 's noisy salutations . On a nearby platform , Asa appeared with their two daughters , and the trio bowed to the hero , husband , and father , before they stepped back into obscurity . Reg 's gunner , a young Okinawan who had gained some celebrity by association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment . " Never in my wildest dreams , " said Edward . " Your wildest dream ? " <p> " My flesh-and-blood . Poster-boy for a Japanese war industry . " " You wish that things had worked out differently . " Hiroto 's tone implied a great span of alternate possibilities , and Edward shook them away , saying only , " I loathe war . " <p> " The Asian campaigns are not expected to last long . " Edward was unsure . The war with China dragged on indefinitely . In the early months of World War II , the Japanese enjoyed many successes , nightmares twisted from Edward 's dreams , flocks of ornithopters darkening skies over the Philippines and Dutch East Indies , the sound and sight of great flapping wings terrorizing villagers , as the ornos swooped down in advance of ground forces , while the Navy blocked sea access and poured troops and equipment into the mainland . The Japanese had developed their own fixed-wing fighter , too - the zero - but it was ornithopters facilitating the invasions , with their ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rooftop to rooftop in ground battles . They engaged fixed-wing craft then dropped into jungle cover , flying through the trees as slow as herons , perching on branches if necessary . Or they hovered high , out of range of land-based retaliation while their gunners picked targets on the ground . Edward suffered through propaganda screened at the local theater , he had seen newsreel footage of an orno flying inside a temple , flapping before the benevolent gaze of a giant , golden Buddha . Ornos transported the Imperial Japanese Army from Eastern China in all directions , advancing its agenda in places where no roads or airfields reached . Images woke Edward in the night , in cold sweat , breathing hard , heart racing . <p> This would be history . Images would filter through the generations , by newsreel , by oral account , by modern myth-making : people would remember a Rising Sun advancing over Asia on terrible feathered wings . He had lost control of his dream . <p> He tried telling himself nobody had control over an idea but could n't convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hypernationalism had still been mostly talk , Edward had made an effort , one desperate effort to avoid that which he feared most . <p> The idea came to him when Toru returned to Meboso . Toru , who still walked with a limp due to his ill-fated test flight . He returned not for further study of ornos or any aspect of science , but wearing a full uniform and ceremonial sword . <p> " Hello Tommy ! " Edward had called to him cheerfully . But Toru looked the other way . <p> The zaibatsu placed Shuko Kan family members in all corridors of Japanese power  --  economic , government , military . These men came to Meboso in showy cars to discuss policy and coordinate their efforts in the zaibatsu 's interest . When Edward saw Toru among this group of elites , early during the Chinese conflict , he requested an audience . <p> He joined a group of eight politicians and generals , including Toru , for dinner . Hiroto introduced Edward to these men , and he recognized some names from national affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were served works of art : rice cakes wrapped in cherry leaf , wild mountain vegetables served on papers folded to resemble cranes . Conversation progressed in Japanese , and Edward , the only one with a fork and a baked carp , poked at his dinner . He waited for a lull in the conversation . When it came , he found the power-brokers looking at him with interest . <p> " They , ah . " Hiroto seemed embarrassed . " They wish to hear your point of view . Your opinion . How you think Japan will fare in the coming conflicts . I 'm sorry , Edward . I 'll tell them you are not interested in politics , only flight . " <p> " No , " said Edward . " It would be my pleasure . " He returned their gazes . <p> " Tell them they can take everything they want in Asia . If they do not drag Britain into the conflict . " Hiroto paused , then began translation . <p> " The West will look for reasons to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward continued . " You must give them good reasons . Make arrangements with them , behind closed doors . Allow for concessions and negotiate . The Americans , too . The American public opposes military action , and if you make bargains , their leaders will have no mandate to stop you . Do n't force the West into a situation where they must fight . Decide what to concede ahead of time , and let them forgive your true ambitions . You can succeed , but only by avoiding Western enemies . " <p> He spoke rapidly , with an edge to his voice , but filtered through Hiroto , his opinion emerged in level , uninflected Japanese . The men leaned toward Hiroto as he spoke . For all Edward knew , his friend could be editing , diluting the message , perhaps saying something completely different . He was at the mercy of translation . When Edward finished , Toru spoke with a sneer . Hiroto interpreted . " Toru suggests you say these things only to avoid war with your homeland . " <p> Edward nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of Japan warring with Britain . But what I tell you also happens to be true , that you will be pitifully sorry if you extend your hostilities beyond Asia . And Reggie-Reggie wo n't endorse military efforts against England . He wo n't promote your ambitions if it means betraying his homeland . You will lose a valuable asset , I promise . " <p> Hiroto translated , flushing slightly . Perhaps the generals knew this was a lie . Perhaps they did n't value Reggie 's propaganda value as highly as Edward presumed . Or perhaps they believed in nationalism enough to think it ran into the flesh and blood of a person , that Reggie might in fact denounce their goals , if faced with fighting his own people . <p> How curious . Here Edward found himself again speaking of the fictional Reggie , the patriot , the son he imagined rather than the son he had . Speaking to zaibatsu power-brokers was the last gambit Edward would make on that imaginary Reggie . He watched the men sit back , in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few years none of this would matter . In a few years this effort would seem pathetic , after his worst fear 's realization . In 1943 , the United States joined the war . With U.S. support , the Allies began to turn the tide in Europe , and not long after , word spread of warships leaving the Atlantic for Asia . <p> The Allies added Japan to their list of enemies , for the expansionism that had gone more or less unchecked since Manchuria . The American navy blockaded the islands , trying to force capitulation by economic strangulation , but the Japanese were entrenched in their conquests , and stealthy lines of supply by ornithopter proved difficult to disrupt . Ornithopters - often in flocks a hundred strong  --  flapped along the coastline , guarding against land invasions which the Allies were rumored to be preparing . Edward became obsessed with the war , demanding English language newsreels and asking Hiroto to translate long articles and editorials . In vicious battles the ornos defended their conquests , feathers littering waters , bodies floating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk hero continued to refuse promotions . Edward read that Reggie Frost had been offered positions of command several times , and each time , he refused , preferring instead to fight on the front line , against the Western forces which he despised so much . <p> How can you be so stupid ? How ? ! <p> Edward said to Hiroto , " He has taken this too far ! Killing fellow countrymen ! Choosing to do so , when he could simply accept a position behind battle lines ! It 's cold-blooded , it 's ... sick . " <p> Hiroto would nod , not necessarily agreeing with these outbursts but understanding their inspiration . How can you be so stupid ? Edward thought . He longed for an end to the war - any ending , victory , defeat , he was n't sure what to hope for - he just wanted it to be done with so he might confront Reggie and force him to answer for his stupidity . Casualties mounted , while rumors circulated of an American invasion of Japan . <p> It never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softening resistance with some secret weapon of unprecedented power , but it had been turned back , twice , by omos and zeros on patrol . Once , in the summer of ' 45 , buildings on Honshu quaked enough for glass to shatter , but the Japanese government and zaibatsu leaders did n't equate this seismic event with the B-52 downed somewhere over the Pacific . <p> The war fizzled . Four years after making mutual declarations of war , both Japan and the Allies found themselves exhausted , depleted , weary of conflict . The Americans had come to view the Japanese occupation of China as a desirable distraction for Russia , which was becoming their greater concern . In 1948 , the U.S.S. Missouri docked in the Shuko Kan family shipyard for the signing of the armistice that would end hostilities . A percentage of the Japanese public came to witness this moment in history , crowds much quieter than at the event Edward had earlier attended . Today the people erupted only once , as ornithopters carrying Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro and General Hideki flapped into view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found satisfaction in their choice of transportation , had he not become suspicious of excuses the Japanese military gave him for Reggie 's absence from this ceremony , and others . 1953 Edward knocked on the door . Asa pulled it open . <p> " Edward , " she said . " How very nice to see you . " Her English had improved . In the background he heard the girls squeal ojsanl and rapid little footsteps preceded their appearance , Fumiyo and Junko , flying at him , wrapping themselves around his legs with such oompf he was almost bowled over . He laughed . Asa looked aghast , but before she might rebuke them , Edward said , " Please , please , this is what I came for ! " The girls looked up , beaming . <p> " Wo n't you come inside Edward for a ... spot of teaR " " Perhaps later . I 'd hoped the girls might take me for a walk . " They hopped up and down . <p> " Yes , ojsan , " said Fumiyo , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Asa said something to the girls in Japanese , which Edward guessed might be translated as : Take care of your grandfather . He 's a very old man , and needs assistance . The girls nodded solemnly . <p> He was about to go , but paused and said to Asa , " I hope it 's not too late for an apology . For not being enthusiastic when you came to see me that day , years ago . You were right . You and Reggie made a fine couple . " Asa smiled and nodded slightly . <p> The girls walked him through gardens , patterns in stone having varied not much over the decades , a slightly different fingerprint whorling about them . The girls appeared healthy and happy . His worries were always alleviated when Asa came to Meboso . She and the girls were managing okay without Reggie : surviving . <p> Reggie had been killed during the war , sometime in November of ' 46 , near the island of Okinawa . An air battle , his omo shot down over water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed tales of heroism to bolster morale , they needed to claim Reggie was alive and demanding to stay on the front lines of air combat , to inspire young Japanese soldiers . The military had , after his death , invented the Reggie they needed . <p> Edward could n't shed his own version of Reggie until after the poor boy , the real boy , had been killed . <p> " Tell us about England , " said Fumiyo , as they walked . " Tell us about Kew Gardens . And the Queen of England . " <p> " Again ? " " England is our country , too . Is n't it ? We 're English girls , in a way ? " Fumiyo looked up at him with bright almond eyes . Edward smiled ; he stroked her black hair , and her sister moved to receive his other hand 's adoration . Sherwood Forest . Cliffs of Dover . The Mersey . The girls drove their mother mad with England , and Edward loved them so much his chest ached . " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fumiyo announced . <p> " I 'm going too ! " said Junko . <p> " You have all the time in the world , " Edward assured them . " And you 'll come with us , ojsan ? " <p> He did n't answer with more than a smile , and the girls became quiet . " There 's something I want you to see . " <p> It was n't just a walk he wanted but a full hike , up a trail out of Meboso . It was nice to get out of the city . Along the way , Edward paused to look at the remains of the old kiln , reduced to an outline of bricks around a rectangle of scorched earth . The trio climbed further , until they could look down on Meboso 's crowded streets . New high-rises were designed with oval holes in their upper heights : ornos landed in these openings , and passengers could get on or off before the craft proceeded out the other side . Edward counted a dozen buildings with such holes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a while , Edward carried her in his arms , while Fumiyo talked and talked . She spoke of school , of rules she was learning about thermals and wind . She was also studying the code of conduct which governed air traffic , and tried to explain it to Edward . <p> A bulky transport flapped through the air like an albatross . Another long orno soared overhead bearing the symbol of Winged Bliss , a commercial enterprise . All traffic was governed by the code , crafts pausing , dipping , turning polite right angles to one another . To Edward it seemed overly formalized  --  flight should n't be decorous as a tea ceremony-but the code had enabled a huge expansion of popular flight . Fumiyo talked about the code and sundry other topics , but she most often returned to one theme . <p> " I want to see England . " " Of course you will . " <p> " We could fly over Cambridgeshire together , " Fumiyo said . " We could fly over the Tower of London . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! " Junko reminded them . <p> They arrived at a ridge overlooking the next valley , which was more industrial than Meboso and centered around a sprawling power plant , though Edward saw no coal , no wood , and there were no rivers nearby . The three of them found rocks to sit on . What kind of power did that leave ? " It 's ugly , " Fumiyo said . <p> " True , " he replied . " But there 's something I want you to see . " They waited and watched , until at last , it appeared . Where ? Where ? Edward pointed it out , the strange craft built perhaps entirely of plastic , with wings unlike anything Edward had seen before . It had emerged from a niche in the power plant 's east wall . Fumiyo and Junko stared at the omo . The wings were the most striking anomaly : diaphanous sheets spread from the body and beat with a liquid , sine-wave motion . But perhaps the more significant difference was what this craft lacked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine that Edward could see , nor accommodation for a fuel tank along its slender , dragonfly fuselage , and his best guess was that the craft received power not from an internal source , but from the power plant , energy somehow transmitted from the concave disks on the roof . <p> The craft rose higher , zipped forward , wings a mathematical blur , and still no sound apart from a gentle churning of the air . <p> " I met a man , " said Edward , " with a dream . " " What man ? " <p> " Okura Shuko Kan . He dreamt of an oro that made no noise . " " He 's not alive still , is he , grandfather ? " " Not in the conventional sense . " <p> They watched the silent omo skim around the power plant some more , looking both frail and revolutionary in its infancy ; then it returned to the cubbyhole in one of the towers . Edward watched his girls , he listened to them , he listened to Fumiyo 's talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs of Dover . He might have told her something that had taken him a long time to discover , a realization that gratified him immensely as he sat with them on a mountain ridge in Japan : it was not so much seeing dreams come precisely true which mattered , but the privilege of having them to begin with , the joy of seeing them realized in ways that surprised even the dreamer .
