<p> DIAGNOSED FIVE years ago with HIV disease and later with AIDS , British film maker Derek Jarman continues to astound his fans and detractors . Instead of surrendering to illness , Jarman has turned his health status to his advantage  --  enjoying the richest , most prolific period of his creative life . <p> Since he was diagnosed , the outspoken , unapologetically gay Jarman has written three books and directed four films , the latest of which , an audacious adaptation of Christopher Marlowe 's Elizabethan drama " Edward II , " opens Friday at the Castro . He 's also become Britain 's unofficial spokesman for people with AIDS and HIV disease  --  virtually the only prominent person in his country to come out of the AIDS closet . <p> With each new film , the 50-year-old Jarman says with a sardonic grin , the critics issue a new round of obituaries  --  bidding him farewell instead of judging his films on their own terms . Even " The Garden , " an experimental piece shot at Jarman 's seaside home in Dungeness , England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swan song  --  a melancholic adieu to life and friends . <p> Jarman scoffs at their shortsightedness , which may be uncharitable on his part , given the fact that details of his health long have been public knowledge . " In the year before last I had all the opportunistic AIDS illnesses you can get , bar one , " he says . " Toxoplasmosis , pneumocystis , TB . I was hacked open . I was in hospital for the better part of a whole year . At one point I was even blind . " That siege ended in September 1990 , Jarman says , " and since then my health has been OK  --  fragile , but all right . " <p> According to Jarman , even his doctors are surprised that he 's alive . His salvation , he says , is two-pronged : One is the burst of work that 's consumed him . And the second is " an incredible support system " that includes his lover , actor Keith Collins , and a large network of friends . He also draws strength from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he 's had excellent heath care . <p> " I know this sounds very perverse , but I decided very early on to enjoy the whole thing . It seemed to me if you were going to spend the summer in hospital , you might as well enjoy it . So I sort of created a situation in the room of as much laughter as possible . " Jarman , accompanied by Collins , is in Park City , a ski resort outside of Salt Lake City , to attend the Sundance Film Festival , the annual showcase for independent film sponsored by Robert Redford 's Sundance Institute . Something of a legend in the indie film world  --  or , at the very least , a prominent survivor  --  Jarman gets the royal treatment with a large , split-level condo and personal driver to escort him through the snow to interviews and screenings . <p> Jarman 's presence also is significant in light of the unusually large slate of gay films at this year 's festival : Gregg Araki 's " The Living End , " Tom Kalin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Times , " even Phillip R. Ford 's " Vegas in Space , " as well as an afternoon panel on gay and lesbian cinema ( called " Barbed Wire Kisses " ) that Jarman joined the day before the interview . <p> Seated among a crew of much younger , black-clad film artists in asymmetrical haircuts  --  one is a teenage lesbian video maker , and most speak urgently of the need for " queer " and " transgressive " art  --  Jarman seemed the older , wiser , but still-radical paterfamilias , smiling with quiet satisfaction , ceding the limelight to his spiritual children . In " Edward II , " Jarman tells the story of the doomed Plantagenet king ( 1284-1327 ) who lived openly with his male lover , Piers Gaveston , and was murdered on the orders of his power-mad wife , Queen Isabella . Jarman updates the tale to the 1990s : He mixes in Annie Lennox singing Cole Porter ; draws parallels to Britain 's present-day repression by staging a melee between gay and lesbian demonstrators and riot police ; and opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two nude men vigorously making love . <p> Jarman says he used " about a third " of Marlowe 's 400-year-old play in his film , focusing on Edward 's love relationship with Gaveston . In his book " Queer Edward , " compiled from his film script and sundry observations , Jarman writes , " Neither Edward nor Gaveston were the limp-wristed , lisping fags so beloved of the tabloids . Edward swam in winter , hedged and ditched the fields of his house at Langley . " <p> Gaveston , he says , " was the finest horseman of his age , and also the finest general . That does n't come through in Marlowe . One of the reasons the noblemen hated him so much is that he was a brilliant jouster . At tournaments , he 'd knock them all off their horses . " <p> Acutely intelligent and opinionated , Jarman holds Marlowe ( 1564-93 ) in much higher esteem than he does that other Elizabethan playwright , William Shakespeare . " Marlowe is a much more vital playwright . He was streaks ahead of Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservative  --  always making apologia with his history , bolstering the regime  --  whereas Marlowe is intensely critical of his time . Had he lived , we would have the most extraordinary Elizabethan drama . " For Jarman , most Shakespeare is " a form of collective masochism " for the audience . " People think they should like these plays and there 's no reason , really . The more you bamboozle them with intellectualization , the more they think they have to say they saw a great play . " <p> Originally a painter , Jarman became a set designer on Ken Russell 's " The Devils , " loathed the studio system of film making ( " I felt imprisoned " ) and made his first feature , " Sebastiane , " a homosexual take on the martyrdom of St. Sebastian , in 1975 . He followed it with " Jubilee " and " The Tempest , " but found himself unable to work when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  --  Jarman calls her " the chief monster of British cinema "  --  came to office . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute , which funded his comeback film , " Caravaggio , " an erotic look at the Renaissance painter . A steady stream of features followed , nearly one for each year : " The Last of England , " " War Requiem , " " The Garden " and now " Edward II . " <p> In addition to so much creative work in the last half-decade , Jarman has given dozens of interviews on HIV and AIDS , essentially representing Britain 's AIDS community . " It 's been very difficult because my health situation is n't parallel to anyone else 's , and yet I 'm actually talking on behalf of a lot of people . . . I sometimes hold my breath and hope my words come out the way I said them . " <p> For the most part , Jarman says , the British press has treated the AIDS epidemic appallingly . When film maker Tony Richardson died last year , one headline blared the news of his " Secret Shame . " When pop star Freddie Mercury 's death followed months later , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of AIDS . " Even such once- staid publications as the Guardian and the Evening Standard are aping the tabloids in their AIDS coverage . <p> In response , Jarman is preparing an exhibition of large canvases for the Manchester City Art Gallery , to open in May . " They asked me specifically if I 'd do HIV-related work so they could focus on it in that city , " he says . " So I 've collected all the front pages from the gutter press in the 1980s . At one point I was going to paint on them in my own blood  --  I thought it would be the best way of confronting everyone with the situation  --  but the hospital was worried about the amount I would need to paint these huge canvases . " <p> Originally a painter ( " I diverted myself with film " ) , Jarman has no plans to do another feature . " If someone comes up with a great idea , I 'll do it , but I feel no pressure . I 've done nine feature films . Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven . Why should I do more ? " <p> If his workload has ebbed , it does n't mean Jarman has surrendered to illness , or settled down for a long , unpredictable slide to his conclusion . He does n't even accept the notion that he will eventually die . " I see no reason why people should n't survive AIDS . I really strongly believe that . It 's very difficult to carry on , saying , ' I 'm ill , I 'm ill , ' when you patently are n't , really . It 's part of the dependency that 's built up . I think it 's an incredible danger , once you 're in that situation , to let yourself become dependent . "
