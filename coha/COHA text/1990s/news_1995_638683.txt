<p> Jefferson County voters trade views on school board race <p> I have been following the school board election fairly closely over the past few months and find myself wondering why the opponents to Dave DiGiacomo and Tori Merritts are so threatened by the Jefferson County Education Association . <p> I attended the forum at Evergreen High School and was shocked and dismayed at how vicious and unfounded the opponent 's attacks are . The teachers association was accused of " money laundrying " ; of " purchasing " the election ; and of having undue influence . In reality , Mr. DiGiacomo 's and Ms. Merritts ' elections have been funded almost entirely by direct contributions by people who really care about our children and about our district . <p> Even more significant , though , is that these attacks on the teachers make me wonder why the opponents are so threatened by the teachers . The teachers are in the best position to know whether the board truly has the concerns of our kids ' welfare at heart . <p> DONNA L. LIPINSKI <p> Evergreen <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign publicly announce their donors before the Oct. 27 , due date . Their action tells me that they have nothing to hide and they want us , the voters , to see that . <p> We know from the early posting of donations that DiGiacomo and Merritts have earned over $ 24,000 in contributions from private citizens , many of those being teachers . Teachers who have chosen to donate because they believe that DiGiacomo and Merritts will do the best job for our schools . We , the voters , should take note : if the teachers are voting for DiGiacomo and Merritts , then we should too . <p> ELISA STARBLE <p> Evergreen <p> I urge every registered voter to vote for Dave DiGiacomo and Tori Merritts for school board in the coming election . All school board elections are important because they determine the future of our schools . This one is more important than most . Two of the five members of the current board , Jeffe Hall and Terri Rayburn , have something on their agenda that has nothing to do with improving public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the National Association of Christian Educators/Committee for Excellence in Education which says , " There are 15,700 school districts in America . When we get an active Christian parents ' committee in operation in all districts , we can take complete control of all school boards . This would allow us to determine all local policy , select good textbooks , good curriculum programs , superintendents and principals . Our time has come ! " <p> The Constitution forbids the state to establish religion . No matter what some say , the public schools are the state . The challengers ' " back to basics " ' agenda should not control Jeffco R-1 . <p> Please vote for DiGiacomo and Merritts . <p> PATRICK FISHER <p> Evergreen <p> Ask yourself what will happen to Jeffco R-1 Schools if school board incumbents David DiGiacomo and Tori Merritts are returned to office ? What will we have ? The highest paid teachers in the state ; the worst maintained facilities in the state ( $ 91 million backlog ) . The highest pupil to teacher ratio in the state ; test scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install " Outcome-Based Education . " It started in 1991 ; the year DiGiacomo was elected . Social engineering of our children will continue . <p> We need some changes . Tom Devenish and Milt Schuster . <p> L. E. LOTITO , Chairman of the Education Committee , Colorado Union of Taxpayers <p> Arvada <p> I continue to be mystified by those who condemn content standards for our Colorado schools on the basis that they are vague , " touchy-feely " and impossible to assess . As a parent and concerned citizen , I spent a few hours at my daughter 's elementary school last spring hashing out with teachers , parents and consultants how those standards could be worded to be specific , clear and measurable . <p> The standards are not vague , they are specific . They are not steeped in notions of liberal " social engineering . " They are sound educational goals - outcomes , if you will , that we all would be pleased to have our children achieve . They have nothing whatever to do with the " dumbing down " of our kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what an arduous task creating the content standards has been and will be , I am very grateful that people such as David DiGiacomo and Tori Merritts , along with Nancy McNally are working so hard to ensure the success of this endeavor . I urge all Jefferson County residents to vote for DiGiacomo and Merritts for School Board . <p> K. STUART PONS <p> Evergreen <p> Dave DiGiacomo , the current president of the Jefferson County School Board , refused to appear with his challenger , Milt Schuster , on KOA 's Mike Rosen show for a public debate . His complaint was that Rosen was opposed to his philosophy and would not provide an " unbiased " forum . Mr. DiGiacomo chose instead to appear on the Greg Dobbs show , where he could count on softball questions from a self-proclaimed liberal host . <p> Mr. DiGiacomo is understandably afraid to face tough questions about why Jefferson County Schools have such poor aggregate test scores , why his campaign literature claims credit for alternative schools and merit pay for teachers when he has fought these ideas at every turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it has been clearly rejected by a majority of district parents . <p> For the sake of our community and our children , I urge your readers to vote for Milt Schuster for the Jefferson County School Board . <p> JOHN B. BROCKMEYER , Chairman <p> Jefferson County Republican Party <p> Golden <p> Support Boulder ' slow growth ' initiative <p> Your editorial on Boulder 's growth control initiatives ignores significant facts that would lead to different conclusions . <p> The Slow Growth Initiative ( Question 2A ) actually slows growth ; Boulder City Council 's actions do not . Including the 1,000,000 square feet that council allowed in the first eight months of 1995 while debating its response to the citizens ' initiative , the six years 1995-2000 will see more growth than the six years 1989-1994 . <p> Regional growth management is already on Boulder County cities ' agendas . Longmont and Lafayette have ballot initiatives related to residential growth . Louisville has already committed to limits to growth . Broomfield is revising its comprehensive plan to deal with growth . It 's time for the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities to balance their housing with jobs and tax base . <p> The Careful Choice charter amendment ( Question 2B ) follows current trends forcing more stringent review of growth decisions . Lakewood , with a population much larger than Boulder 's , requires only 200 signatures to force a super-majority vote of the council on rezonings . Parker and Meade already require unanimous council approval on annexations , and more cities are considering this step . Statutory cities allow referendums with 5 percent of registered voters ' signatures , not the unreasonable 10 percent required in Boulder . <p> STEPHEN POMERANCE <p> Boulder <p> Razor wire can keep vandals from defacing signs <p> Graffiti covers many of our freeway signs in Denver and appears more and more in surrounding areas . Sign crews must routinely repaint signs to keep our city tidy . Los Angeles had a similar problem while I lived there five years ago . Los Angeles found an answer that also will help Denver . <p> In order to keep the signs clean , we must prevent the gang members from reaching the sign . Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youths use to reach the signs . One or two coils around each pole with coils around the top of signs attached to overpasses will keep the disrespectful taggers off the signs and out of our vision . Some of you might say that razor wire is ugly , but only two or three coils around each access point seems to work in L.A. Unless one looks very carefully at the signs , the wire does not appear to stand out . What does stand out is the fact that there is no spray paint on the signs anymore . <p> JIM DANEKE <p> Westminster <p> Sales tax hike <p> for Lakewood city center <p> is well worth it <p> Without understanding our problems , The Post has published an editorial concerning Lakewood 's future , and our last chance for a wonderful City Center . <p> Denver 's Civic Center is a dream of architectural planning . Its beautiful city hall faces wide lawns and flower beds that sweep to and across Broadway to the foot of the Capitol dome . <p> So why this smug evaluation concerning Lakewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical end ? <p> Lakewood 's City Hall is already on the property southwest of the Alameda-Wadsworth intersection . <p> Who , if anyone , is doing the thinking for The Post 's opinion ? <p> If The Post knows of any other suitable open space that is left in Lakewood , please let us know . In over 25 years of trying , our citizens have n't found one . <p> DOROTHY BRADSHAW <p> Lakewood
