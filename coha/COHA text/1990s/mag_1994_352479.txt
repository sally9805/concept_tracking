HERE 'S A BRILLIANT , BROODING novel , a literary work of the first class , built around a confounding falsification by the author that reduces the entire book to the level of a clever and nearly meaningless stunt . Find an explanation if you can . <P> The situation in The Master of Petersburg ( Viking ; 250 pages ; $21.95 ) is this : J.M. Coetzee , the South African novelist , has placed himself in the turbulent , ironic mind of Fyodor Dostoyevsky . It is 1869 ; the writer is 49 , self-exiled in Dresden at mid-career , with Poor Folk and Crime and Punishment behind him and The Brothers Karamazov far in the future . He is a passionate , tormented idealist , still roiled by the Western liberal notions of social and political freedom that had swept the Russian intelligentsia a generation before . But the new , younger Russian intellectuals are not liberals ; they are nihilists and anarchists , and Dostoyevsky is repelled and shaken . This ferment will result , two years later , in the towering " pamphlet-novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vigorous new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky ) Demons  --  the demons being the indigestible Western ideas that were unsettling Russia . <P> In Coetzee 's darkly convincing narration , Dostoyevsky hears that his 21- year-old stepson Pavel Isaev , who has fallen in with nihilists in Petersburg , has been murdered , perhaps by the police or by his comrades . The writer travels to Petersburg , finds the rooming house where Pavel had lived and  --  guilt-haunted because he did not get along well with this difficult son of his dead first wife  --  moodily retraces the young man 's last months . He tries to retrieve Pavel 's papers from the police and is subjected to repeated , insinuating interrogations . He encounters a deadly , contemptuous young nihilist named Nechaev , who seems to live from child prostitution and who may have been Pavel 's killer . Later , back in Pavel 's rooming house , where he is staying , sleeping in Pavel 's bed , wearing his stepson 's unwashed clothes , Dostoyevsky begins to sketch the character who will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives the action in Demons . <P> So Coetzee sums things up . But there are some facts the typical reader may not know that he ought to : in real life Dostoyevsky did not travel to Petersburg in 1869 ; he remained in Dresden . His stepson Pavel was not murdered by nihilists or anyone else . A pest and a spendthrift , he tormented the author all his life , and a standard scene from biographies has Pavel being forcibly kept from Dostoyevsky 's deathbed . Nechaev did exist , and Dostoyevsky did transform him into a character in Demons , but the student his gang murdered in a celebrated crime was one Ivan Ivanov . Coetzee could hardly help knowing this , but not a word of preface or footnote explains that historical truth has been meddled with .
