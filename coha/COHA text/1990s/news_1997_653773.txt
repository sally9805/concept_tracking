<p> THE jury is still out on whether Jonathan Steinberg really has the Midas touch . What is already clear is that he has a lot of brass . <p> While still in his 20 's , Mr. Steinberg , who dropped out of college , won The Wall Street Journal 's monthly investing contest six times from 1990 to 1994 by betting on tiny , often flighty stocks . Using his reputation as a stock picker and his family money  --  he is the eldest son of Saul P. Steinberg , one of the most feared corporate raiders of the 80 's  --  young Mr. Steinberg , now 32 , went on to build a media empire that specializes in investment tips on small , even obscure , stocks . <p> He has gradually turned an old penny-stock tip sheet into a glossy monthly , Individual Investor , with a paid circulation of almost half a million . Mr. Steinberg boasts that it is " the most useful and original personal finance magazine in America . " His properties also include a small newsletter , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web and a recent book , " Midas Investing : How You Can Make at Least 20 Percent in the Stock Market This Year and Every Year " ( Times Business/ Random House ) . <p> And he donned yet another hat in 1994 , raising millions of dollars for a so-called hedge fund , Wisdom Tree , that he manages for wealthy investors . <p> But not everything is golden in Mr. Steinberg 's empire , despite its glittery surface . The public company he runs , Individual Investor Group Inc. , just reported its worst quarterly loss in five years . His once-hot investment fund is in the red , his published stock picks are lagging behind the market and some longtime readers are starting to complain that they are getting poor advice . <p> And he has recently beefed up his disclosure policy , revealing that the fund he manages has more holdings than previously announced in the tiny stocks he recommends in his publications  --  stocks that are sometimes moved by those recommendations . While the increased disclosure is no doubt good for his readers , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive , editor in chief and portfolio manager . <p> Mr. Steinberg says he is not worried about conflicts of interest because of the company 's disclosure policies and trading rules . " We are very aware of what the S.E.C. is looking for , " he said . A more serious problem , to him , is the distraction that comes from trying to do several things at once . Fortunately , he said , " there is a lot of overlap between my magazine duties and my money-management duties . " <p> Indeed , Mr. Steinberg seems to personify the blurring of the line between journalists and the people they cover , between people who write and people who do . <p> Though Susan Molinari caused a stir recently when she announced that she would leave Congress for a news anchor 's job at CBS , such shifts are getting to be old hat for Wall Street . Financial journalism has attracted everyone from Fidelity Investments , the mutual fund behemoth that owns Worth magazine , to Michael R. Bloomberg , the former bond trader who has built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mutual fund managers from Peter Lynch on down have become media stars , Forbes magazine has long had columnists from Wall Street and George Soros 's former partner , James B. Rogers Jr. , holds forth as a host on CNBC . <p> Then there is James J. Cramer , who manages a hedge fund while running an Internet news service called thestreet.com , opining in a weekly column for The New York Observer and writing regularly in Worth . But Mr. Cramer , who was mortified by an uproar over some small stocks he had owned and praised in Smart Money , has vowed to adhere to guidelines aimed at avoiding even the appearance of impropriety . <p> For example , he can not suggest a story to the staff of thestreet.com  --  even though he owns almost a third of the company . The reporters and his hedge fund 's investment staff are in different buildings , and are forbidden to speak to each other . And though he discloses any ownership stake in stocks mentioned in his columns , Mr. Cramer no longer publishes his stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , he said , to distinguish his operation from other Internet sites and publications , including Mr. Steinberg 's . Why does n't he approve of Mr. Steinberg ? " I think he 's in the business I 'm in , " Mr. Cramer replied , referring to money management . " Let him do what he wants ; I feel I have to take special measures . " <p> Mr. Cramer may be wise to be extra careful . People who wear two hats can " play very close to the edge , " said Barry P. Barbash , director of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission , referring to such issues as how they use inside information and whether they invest in stocks ahead of clients or readers , which under some circumstances can amount to illegal front-running . " They put themselves in a very difficult situation , " he continued , " and their compliance damn well better be good . " <p> For journalists , the blurring of the distinction beween reporters and investors raises questions about motivation and responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Journalism , a Washington research group . " The traditional standard is , ' My aim is to get information to the public that is accurate and that I am disinterested in , ' " he said . " ' All I care about is whether something is true , not who profits . ' " <p> But to Mr. Steinberg , profits are key  --  not just his profits , or those of his investors , but also those of his readers . " At bottom , to succeed as a company , we have to help people make money , " he said . His goal , he added , is simply " to find great investment ideas , money-making opportunities . " <p> In fact , Mr. Steinberg considers what he does to be research more than journalism . He describes Individual Investor as research in a magazine 's clothing , investment ideas packaged to attract advertisers and readers . <p> Individual Investor , which is not related to Institutional Investor magazine , includes bright colors , snappy graphics , an occasional bit of spritely writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and taxes and advice on what to do if you lose your stock certificates . Indeed , part of the reason the company is unprofitable is that it has spent huge sums redesigning the magazine and adding to the editorial staff . <p> On the newsstands , then , Individual Investor looks almost indistinguishable from titles like Money , Smart Money and Worth . But it is fundamentally different . Its meat is not news about securities markets or the investment ideas of Wall Street gurus . <p> Instead , Individual Investor 's main focus is the stocks picked by Mr. Steinberg and his group of newly minted analysts . Tiny companies all , they tend to feature rapid earnings growth , heavy insider buying , rising stock prices and what he views as exciting new products . He shuns companies that are traded on Nasdaq 's OTC Bulletin Board , which has no listing requirements , and insists that companies have at least a million shares the public can buy . <p> AND Mr. Steinberg 's favorite role is not chief executive , editor or even portfolio manager  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offices in midtown Manhattan makes clear . " I love reading business information , " he said . " And now I 'm paid to do research all the time . " <p> Though his editorial voice can make him seem arrogant  --  " No great loss , " he once wrote of losing Microsoft as a partner in a project  --  in person , Mr. Steinberg is boyishly brash , clutching a football and reveling in high-tech gizmos like a Bloomberg data terminal with two screens and a compact disk player that opens at the wave of a hand . <p> At a table overlooking the obligatory view of Manhattan ( from the 38th floor , in this case ) , Mr. Steinberg explains that he landed in publishing almost by accident . For one thing , he suffered from a reading disability so severe that when his school friends " were reading ' The Yearling , ' I was one step above ' The Cat in the Hat , ' " he said . <p> But he had always been entranced by number-heavy financial reports like Value Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his father . Saul Steinberg was a boy wonder who turned a small insurance company into the giant Reliance Group Holdings , where he still serves as chairman and chief executive . <p> " When my dad would wake up in the morning , I 'd be depressed because I was going to school , but he 'd throw his arms in the air and say , ' I love being alive , ' " Mr. Steinberg recalled . " He was self-made , and I wanted to be self-made ; I did n't want to be the stereotypical son of a wealthy person , but as confident and powerful as he was . " <p> OF course , Mr. Steinberg 's definition of " self made " is probably quite different from that of many entrepreneurs , who would feel lucky to inherit a pocket watch from Grandpa . Mr. Steinberg inherited enough money from his grandfather to buy the Penny Stock Journal in 1988 , and he received early financial support from his father and his brother-in-law , Jonathan Tisch , president of Loews Hotels . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Individual Investor Group . <p> Jonathan Steinberg , known as Jono to his friends , found his big idea when he was working on Wall Street at Bear , Stearns , and realized that almost no information was readily available about the vast majority of public companies , those with a total stock value of less than $250 million . <p> Professional investors generally disdain such small companies , because they often require too much research for the amount of profits they can generate , and because the thinly traded shares can be hard to sell . But Mr. Steinberg disagreed . " Some percentage of them , I bet , would perform very well , " he said . And , since most institutional investors were not active in this area , he thought it would be a place where individuals would have a leg up . <p> Mr. Steinberg 's passion for investments is apparent at his company 's weekly " analysts meeting , " at which a clutch of bright young men propose investment ideas for the newsletter , Individual Investor 's Special Situations Report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Wisdom Tree fund ( which also has its own special analyst ) . <p> Though it is a scene you would never find in a magazine or newspaper office , in some ways the meeting could be occurring in any Wall Street firm that employs young people still waiting for the results of their exams to become certified financial analysts . Under the direction of Mr. Steinberg and Thomas C. Byrne , the director of research , five of the young men make their cases for their favorite stocks , describing new products and spouting financial ratios . <p> Despite their obvious smarts and sophisticated financial skills , the analysts and their bosses still display a certain naivete , especially for people dealing in the risky world of very small stocks , where financial performance can be fleeting and investors ' interests do not always take precedence . <p> For example , one analyst argued for a laboratory testing company that is paying a hefty dividend , even though its operations are not generating enough money to cover the dividend payments . Maintaining the dividend was cited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were turning around . No one even wondered if perhaps the controlling stockholder was siphoning off some of the company 's sizable cash hoard in the form of dividend payments . <p> The analysts also discussed the prospects for a shoe company called Steve Madden Ltd. without , apparently , being aware of its major claim to fame in the financial world : it was underwritten in 1993 by Stratton Oakmont , probably the country 's most notorious penny-stock operation , which was shut down by regulators last year in part because of its manipulation of Madden stock . <p> Later , over iced tea and rare tuna at Le Bernardin , Mr. Steinberg said he makes it a rule not to judge a company by the way it went public . " You ca n't read a lot into it , " he said . " Small entrepreneurs are just trying to raise money . If a brokerage firm is being dishonest in its dealings , that does n't mean " its clients are . <p> Mr. Steinberg has his own reasons for being appreciative of small brokerage firms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire that he said he was willing to go bankrupt rather than ask his family for more money , Mr. Steinberg was rescued by a small investment outfit , GKN Securities , which was willing to help him sell shares to the public . The offering took place at the end of 1991 , when the company raised almost $4 million . <p> What public investors got was a 46 percent stake in a money-losing company that basically had two products : a small newsletter called Special Situations Report , which focused on one company each month , and Individual Investor , which had a circulation of less than 65,000 and looked a little like Barron 's , the weekly Dow Jones magazine that is published on newsprint . <p> And they got Jono himself , who had become something of a media star through his appearances in The Wall Street Journal . In March 1990 , he became one of the professional stock pickers who compete against a randomly selected group of stocks ( Journal reporters throw darts at stock tables ) , a monthly exercise that functions as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steinberg shone . His first pick , American Film Technologies , soared almost 40 percent in one month , and his second , Image Entertainment , posted a 9 percent gain in a falling market . <p> But there may have been less there than met the eye . Both of his first picks were very cheap stocks , and it did n't take a big price move to cause a winning percentage gain . For instance , Image 's 9 percent increase translates into a move from 69 cents to 75 cents . <p> Moreover , these were tiny companies with relatively few shares available to the public . Insiders owned 36 percent of American Film 's 19.5 million shares ; Image Entertainment had 142 million shares outstanding , but insiders owned almost three-quarters of them . Just a few buyers could push the price up , and did . <p> The " Steinberg effect " became even clearer with his third pick , Management Company Entertainment , an obscure outfit whose stock zoomed 36 percent the day it was his pick in The Journal , on 37 times its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , ending the month with a 6 percent gain , which was not enough to win that month 's contest . ) <p> The longer-term track record of these companies left something to be desired . Within a few months of appearing in The Journal , Management Company Entertainment had filed for bankruptcy protection , as did American Film Technologies and Mr. Steinberg 's fourth pick , Financial News Network . <p> The Journal , meanwhile , decided to change the contest , because of concerns over the effect of publicity on short-term stock prices . The time period for assessing a stock 's performance was lengthened to six months from one , and the minimum stock price raised to $2 . <p> Mr. Steinberg went on to have some big winners , like Dell Computer ; some big losers , like Software Toolworks , and some big winners that ultimately turned into losers , like Clearly Canadian , a little beverage company whose stock went from $7.50 to $25 in a year , and then plunged into the pennies . <p> In 15 tries , Mr. Steinberg won 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some of the worst performers in the history of the contest . <p> A similar pattern prevailed in the stocks Mr. Steinberg picked for Individual Investor , especially the Magic 25 , an annual list of small-company stocks he thinks can average a 50 percent return in the next 12 months . ( Just for comparison 's sake , over the last 50 years the biggest annual jump for the Dow Jones 30 industrials was a 44 percent gain in 1954 . ) Bravely , Mr. Steinberg decided to publish his performance , warts and all . <p> Not that there were many warts , at first . In its first year , 1992 , the Magic 25 rose an average of 15 percent ; in 1993 , it zoomed almost 43 percent . <p> Given those results , perhaps it is understandable that Mr. Steinberg decided to manage real money in addition to a paper portfolio , despite the headaches such a move would bring . By running a private pool of money known as a hedge fund , rather than a publicly offered pool like a mutual fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the S.E.C. as an investment adviser , with the paperwork and reporting that entails . <p> Nevertheless , the company still has to deal with the potential for conflicts of interest and front-running . Front-running is a particular problem when the focus is on very small stocks , whose prices can spurt , at least temporarily , from positive publicity . <p> In fact , data prepared by Mr. Steinberg 's staff indicate that his operations are effective , at least , in stirring up interest in their " house stocks . " After the company 's Web site opened to the public in May , trading volume in those stocks soared by tens of thousands of shares . <p> " You can definitely push up price and volume " of trading by writing about a stock , Mr. Steinberg allowed , but he argued that the effect was only temporary , and unpredictable  --  some of his best pieces of research have not budged stocks . <p> But to avoid conflicts , Mr. Steinberg 's staff members are prohibited from trading personally in the shares of the companies his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at many publications ; at The New York Times , for example , reporters who regularly cover investments can not own stock in individual companies , although they can hold investments in diversified mutual funds . <p> As for Wisdom Tree , the fund has a policy of not trading in a stock mentioned in the magazine for two weeks before publication and for four weeks afterward . And if the trade would be contrary to a published recommendation  --  for instance , if the fund wants to sell something the magazine said was a buy  --  it must wait six weeks . <p> " It is not our intention to profit from a stock by writing about it , " Mr. Steinberg wrote when spelling out these restrictions in the January 1997 issue of Individual Investor . <p> And in June , the magazine started telling readers whenever the fund or any affiliate owns shares in any company the magazine writes about . In the current issue , there are a handful , including six members of this year 's Magic 25 list : ACT Networks , Biotime , Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This disclosure marks a sharp change from past practice ; until recently , Individual Investor told readers about the fund 's holdings only if it owned 5 percent or more of a company in the portfolio , because , Mr. Steinberg said , he was worried that readers would take his investment as an extra-strong buy recommendation . The new policy makes the magazine 's writers more comfortable , he said , although " it 's not an easy tension , and it may continue to evolve . " <p> In practice , the old rule meant disclosures were rare . In January , for example , Mr. Steinberg mentioned holdings only in Biotime , THQ and Human Genome ( in which Reliance owns " a sizable stake " ) . <p> S.E.C. filings indicate that the fund owned both Biotime and THQ before recommendations for the stocks appeared in the magazine , a practice Mr. Steinberg justifies by noting that he is willing to take more risks in the fund than he feels comfortable suggesting to readers . <p> " The fund does have the ability to be more aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out " if things go wrong , he said , noting that recommending quick moves in a monthly magazine is almost impossible . <p> Whatever controversy and conundrums arise from wearing two hats must have seemed well worth it at first , when both the Magic 25 and the fund scored hefty gains . Indeed , 1995 was a great year for both , as each rocketed up more than 50 percent . ( As an unregulated hedge fund that can not market itself to the public , the fund can not publicly report its results , but because the Individual Investor Group has money in it , rough performance estimates can be calculated from the company 's public filings . ) The company takes a percentage of the fund 's profits as a management bonus ; in 1995 , it received more than $4 million . Assets under management soared to more than $50 million . <p> But last year , things turned . Though the Magic 25 racked up a gain of 16 percent , by the magazine 's reckoning , it trailed most major market indexes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund appears to have suffered a loss of more than 5 percent in 1996 , according to S.E.C. filings from the Individual Investor Group . In addition to trading costs and the use of borrowed money , which magnifies gains and losses , the fund appears to have owned big chunks of some clunkers , including Country Star Restaurants , which went through four auditors last year as the stock plunged from almost $6 to pennies . <p> THE fund 's loss dragged down revenues at the Individual Investor Group , even though the magazine 's ad revenues boomed . The company ended the year with a loss of more than $3 million , versus a $2.9 million gain in 1995 . Wisdom Tree investors fled , pulling more than $18 million out of the roughly $66 million fund , though Mr. Steinberg said that more than $10 million had flowed in recently . <p> The carnage continued in the first quarter of this year . By the end of March , the fund had lost almost a third of its value , even as the overall stock market gained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so , despite a strong first quarter for the magazine , the company lost $2.4 million . <p> The Magic 25 has not been doing too well either  --  by late April , it was down almost 7 percent  --  and despite a recent rebound , readers have been grumbling . <p> " I have been a subscriber for many years , and this is the first time I have lost money with them , " one subscriber wrote in an electronic message posted on Individual Investor 's own bulletin board . <p> The market has been rough for small-cap stocks , Mr. Steinberg said , " even small caps with good news , " and for technology stocks in particular . But he acknowledges being somewhat baffled by the market right now . <p> " I do n't really have an answer , " he said . " This is relatively unique since I 've been in the business , such underperformance compared to large caps .
