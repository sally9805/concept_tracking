IN MARY 'S KITCHEN , THE SMELL OF RAT is so strong she can taste it . It hangs thickly , like a market goat , dripping headless on a hook . She tries to walk around it , not breathing , but the smell is unavoidable . The kitchen is jewel-like , the afternoon sun sparkling through the south-facing windows , the glimpse of snow still high on the Himalayan foothills ; but the sun 's warmth just ferments the source of the smell hidden somewhere in the room , catalyzing the rats ' sweet stink , permeating the only place in her flat that is warm , that gets any light . The smell is tolerable in the morning chill , when even late into spring the windows are still frosted at sunrise ; but by the afternoon it makes her think of a large department store , of rushing past the cutglass counters dense with a choking fog of atomized perfumes . She crosses the sun-warmed concrete floor and starts opening the windows-large frames divided into lightsand sticks her head out to breathe . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her garden , and she watches as two small boys play with the rims of old bicycle tires . The game is played with a stick and a loop of wire , wrapped around the spokeless rim so they can balance it as they run up and down the side-street . They wear clothes typical for this Himalayan hill-town-dirty rags , a brimless wool cap with a colorful border , and , since the streets are still thick with slush and dark running water , sockless feet in black rubber galoshes . They run up and down , five or six years of age , completely absorbed in the art of balancing their wheel rim . Mary pulls her head back into the kitchen , leaving the windows open despite the nip in the air outside . <p> She wants to bake something . She is in a baking kind of mood . But in her adopted town , high in the foothills of Northern India , there is little in the way of ingredients she is used to : the flour is coarse , the white sugar brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers . She avoids looking at it too closely . It is matted black and dung-like , and the smell is strong of burnt molasses . She can find , with little difficulty , a good quality cinnamon bark , and some months ago a missionary friend living in the plains in the South had sent her whole nutmegs . Grated by hand , the nutmegs are so fragrant they can obliterate the rat smell , for moments at a time making the kitchen as pleasant as her grandmother 's . She has a whole bag-full , far more than she will ever use , but finds it difficult to part with them . <p> She 'd been up the night before , attending a delivery . The nurse had sent for her just after ten o'clock , but when she 'd checked the laboring villager , the woman had been far from ready . Mary 's gloved hand slipped fingers deep , sweeping round the thinning cervix . A few more hours at least , she 'd thought , snapping off the rubber glove , smiling at the worried mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her Hindi . <p> Her kitchen has no real oven , but a black tin box , rusty on the inside , which she can place over a burner on her bottled-gas stove . She has n't yet baked anything unburned in the eight months she 's lived in the town . She is used to it . Resigned . She was surprised that she could bake at all , that the hospital could offer her a flat so nice , a toilet she can sit down on . She 'd expected something different : a dirt floor , an open fire , perhaps a mattress stuffed with straw . Instead she 'd found a three-room flat , her bed a six-inch block of foam , a toilet she can really flush , a tandoor with a chimney pipe . <p> She 'd found cocoa at a dry goods store , just three blocks from the hospital , the narrow stall so crammed with odds and ends that she could n't even step inside . She stood out on the crowded walk and pointed out the dusty can , thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chalky look , and an impotent taste , and her brownies came out blonde and salty , with a grittiness from the coarse sugar . She once had made a batch of chocolate chip cookies , the chips produced by breaking up a candy bar . She had n't enjoyed it as much as she 'd thought because she loves to eat the raw dough , but was too afraid of salmonella , to put it past her lips . <p> She decides she 'll make an apple cake . When she 'd first arrived in the little town it had been fall , and the apples grown in the surrounding valley had been excellent . She 'd been warned by the hospital administrator to peel them " deeply , " due to the overspraying of pesticides . Now eight months later , the apples are in bad shape from wintering over , and the apple skins are soft and wrinkled , shriveled , rubbery . But even still , an apple cake takes no brown sugar , and no cocoa , and the batter is not nearly so tempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin of flour on the table in front of the open window . Looking up , out over the stone wall to the street , she notices that the two young boys are no longer balancing their wheel rim , but instead are standing by the side of the road , watching . Something is coming . She leans forward through the opening of the window as far as she can , but is unable to see what it is . <p> Last night , Mary had spent the hour before midnight in the nurses room , warming herself by the tandoor , waiting for the woman 's labor to progress . The watchman , bless his heart , had anticipated her coming , stoking the stove as she 'd entered the little room . All winter she 'd been cold , dressing deep in polypropylene , layered in woolen sweaters bought in the bazaar . The winter had been mild , the snow dense and wet . She 'd seen patients in the unheated clinic , touching the tip of her pen to the coil-heater under her desk to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an x-ray , another chest flowing with tuberculosis . Now it is May , with blossoms on the orchard trees , but she feels somehow that she has n't lost the chill . The watchman is Tibetan , a bachelor and refugee . He is a small man with a broad and handsome face , a trim waist . Mary passed the time chatting with the nurses ' aide , who knitted socks from wool she 'd spun herself . She watched the watchman as he whistled through a smile , as he poked life into the fire he might have let burn out if Mary had not been there . <p> She had borrowed an electric blender from a neighbor , thinking that she could process the raw granulated sugar into something finer , something more like home . She puts the blender on the table by the window , near the single electrical outlet in the kitchen , but as she plugs it in , she sees the red light on the outlet box is dark . The power is off . Again . Inside , she feels a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she quickly extinguishes . This is not a problem . This is a village , high in the Himalayas , and she 'd wanted to come here , after all . Nobody made her come . She decides she will wait five minutes for the power to return before proceeding to bake with the unrefined sugar . The weather has been fine . She doubts that the power outage is anything other than the usual minor interruption . <p> She steps back to the window , both for the warmth of the sunshine and to escape the fading stink of rat . Closer to the window , she can faintly hear a droning chant , a faintly beating drum , and again she sees the boys watching something down the street . She leans out again , and this time she can see what is coming up the road . It is a large group of people , marching slowly . Probably another group of strikers , of disgruntled taxi drivers or brick flingers or gravel crushers . Day-long strikes have become so commonplace to her now that she hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never quite been sure what the issues are anyway . <p> The apples need peeling . It is something she can do while she waits for the electricity . Mr. Electricity . Sometimes he 's home , sometimes he 's not . She takes the apples to the table by the window , and fills a bowl with water from her filter tank for rinsing . The draft from the window is chilling , but the sun is brilliantly warm , and she sets a chair in the sun , and sets herself on the chair . The apples are soft and wrinkled and almost disgusting to the touch . It is difficult to peel them , because the skin is so leathery , and the cloud of fruitflies has followed her from the fruit bin . Under the skin , the apple is pulpy rubber but with a delicious smell , like a sparkling cider , a bit fermented . <p> The apples make her think of a woman she had seen several days ago in clinic . The skin is the same , she thinks , rubbing a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled fruit . She remembers the ancient woman lying on the wooden exam table , her family crowded all around . She 'd been placed there by a grandson who had gently carried her to the hospital in his arms , leading half her village down a steep and narrow walking path . The woman 's ears were rimmed with silver hoops , a dozen on each side , the lobes as soft as bread dough , sagging with the weighty ornaments , holes large enough to pass a thumb . She would n't eat , the family said ; she 'd stopped talking . Mary looked at the patient , whose eyes seemed dull and cast aside , then looked up across a sea of concern , of faces sad yet businesslike . She knew this was their matriarch , her entire clan there pushing through the clinic door . They were from a village over an hour 's walk up valley , dismally pretty : thick slate roofs with stone gray walls , chimney-less and filled with smoke , everyone with chronic coughs . She looked down at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadaver-like , her mouth without teeth . She had a hoop pierced between her nostrils that reached down to her lower lip . Mary remembers pulling the silver pins from the woman 's pattu , the yards of brightly woven wool that all the village women wear . Her clothing smelled of unwashed skin , of woodsmoke from a cooking fire . <p> Outside , it is beginning to cloud over toward the south . The weather through the winter had been pleasant as winters go . The snow came late , with nothing until January , and when it came it was soft and abundant . She loved the snow , and even now she does n't mind the slush , the thick dark water flowing quickly between the remaining piles of snow in town . She 'd grown tired of the dripping roofs , the lack of gutters so that she wanted an umbrella just to cross a threshold . But the last bit of snow came off the roofs a few weeks past . Now she watches as more weather arrives . It is moving quickly up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rain will help , she thinks , to melt the remaining snowpiles . <p> The baby emerged at half-past one . Mary had dozed off , sitting near the tandoor , unable to follow the melody of Kullui spoken softly between the watchman and the nurses ' aide . She woke startled , the duty nurse standing breathless in the doorway . <p> " Doctor-ji ! Come quickly ! " <p> The boys out on the street have disappeared , but then she sees them standing huddled in a doorway . They also have seen the clouds , and have learned to run for cover or get left out . The marching crowd is moving very slowly up the road , seemingly unconcerned about the impending shower . She watches as they approach , a very large group , with all men at the front . As they get closer , she can see what they are carrying now , each of them , over their shoulders . Each man is carrying a large piece of wood , some pieces as big as a large man 's leg . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun suddenly fades . In its place comes a wonderful breeze , cold and fragrant . She can see , on the side of the valley above the town , the deodar trees swaying . She shivers . The rain starts . At first it is just a few scattered drops , big as berries , but quickly it becomes a downpour . Rain comes in through the windows with the wind , and Mary stands to close them . She must reach out to grab the windows , and leaning out she better sees the marching wood carriers . She 's no longer certain it 's a strike , for in the middle of the crowd there are a dozen men carrying a large bundle high above their heads . The bundle is wrapped in cloth , white and stiff . The group carries it slowly , continuing its chanting , the drum beating slowly . <p> She had arrived panting in the delivery room , her hand out for some sterile gloves . The mother was pushing , knees and ankles spread apart . Mary had only glimpsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winking eye . Her hand tore through the rubber glove , but with no time to replace it she had pushed her naked palm against the tiny buttocks peeking out , tried to keep it up inside until she felt this last contraction stop . She felt the mother 's womb relax . She 'd then slipped a finger around the side , searched there for the little knees , and one by one she 'd buckled them , then slid the baby 's feet out first . <p> It is quieter with the windows closed , though the smell of rat has grown again , and the rain clouds have made her kitchen dark . She glances at the outlet , where her neighbor 's blender cord is plugged . The red light is on , the power 's back . She can grind her sugar after all . Mary picks up another apple , her worn-down little paring knife , and she remembers what she saw back when she 'd pulled the old woman 's pattu down , unbuttoning her cotton blouse . The left breast had been walnut-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands against the old woman 's belly , surprised at how the skin was soft , draping over tumors that felt hard and large as thundereggs . Through the rain splashed on her window , she can see the crowd now marching by . She hears the chanting and the drum . They are right outside her garden wall , and she puts her knife and apple down , leaning toward the window to better see . The rain has soaked the stiff white cloth , her windows are blurred and streaked with rain . She reaches for the latch . <p> She remembers doing up the buttons on the dying woman 's blouse , replacing the tarnished silver pins that held the woman 's pattu dress . She still can smell the unwashed skin , the woodsmoke wafting densely from the coarse woolen cloth . For a moment , she thought the woman looked at her , but then she was sure she was mistaken . There was nothing she could do , she thought . <p> " Take her home , " she said . <p> And last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slippery legs just dangling there ; she 's sick with fear the head was stuck , when suddenly it slithered out . She 'd watched the baby 's skin turn pink , watched his arms and legs contract . The father passed out sweets to the staff , celebrating his first son : handsome little store-bought cakes , though disappointing sickly sweet . <p> Mary pushes open the windows . She feels the rain against her face and neck . She 's confirming what she thought she saw , what 's bundled in the shrouds of cloth . The rain has soaked the bundle through , so she sees the body wrapped inside , the cloth is now translucent , a deflated amniotic sack . She realizes what the wood is for now . They are taking this body to a place where two rivers meet , there to build a pyre . She wonders about the rain . They move as slowly now , in the downpour , as they did in the pleasant sunshine only a moment before . She looks at the boys in the doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she first imagined , but still , even through this drenching shower , she can see the dirty snot on their upper lips , the black soot on their clothes . She looks away to the body , the corpse in white . The rain has thoroughly soaked the shroud . It clings to the face and body . She can make out the shape of the nose , can see the hollows of the eyes , the bony ribs , the emaciated pelvis . It is the corpse of a woman , old and weathered , wrinkled as an apple . <p> The rain comes through the window , dampening her table top , and instinctively she pushes aside the electric blender , pulls the plug out of the wall . It would be easier , she thinks , to just get used to the coarseness of the sugar . She measures out a cupful , dumps it in a metal bowl . And it comes to her suddenly , as she watches the mourners march past down her street , how difficult their task will be , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
