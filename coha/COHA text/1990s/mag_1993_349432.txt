Most remarkable about the scene were not the security man and woman from the CIA standing outside the Senator 's office on Capitol Hill last month . Dennis DeConcini is , after all , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a frequent host to high-level visitors from the agency . What was unusual was the cast of characters they were there to protect . When DeConcini 's heavy wooden office door opened , out stepped CIA Director R. James Woolsey  --  accompanied by none other than Yevgeni Primakov , head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service , successor organization to the KGB . Picking up their guards , the chiefs of the world 's two largest intelligence agencies , once mortal enemies , bustled down the corridor to another meeting . <P> Virtually unnoticed , Primakov spent four days in Washington in mid-June , meeting with Woolsey and the House and Senate intelligence committees . In several lengthy talks , Primakov and Woolsey discussed how their organizations can cooperate and share information on worldwide threats such as terrorism , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one paid to Moscow last October by Robert Gates , Woolsey 's predecessor as Director of Central Intelligence , who also dropped by the Russian embassy for a drink and a chat during Primakov 's stay . <P> Were he still alive , James Jesus Angleton , the CIA 's consummate cold war spook , would have launched a full-scale internal investigation , condemning a conversation of any substance between Primakov , a longtime Kremlin Middle East expert , and Woolsey , a specialist on nuclear and conventional arms control , as treasonous . During most of their careers , the U.S. and the Soviet Union struggled for every square foot of terrain anywhere on earth that one might win from the other . With nuclear war in the balance , Moscow and Washington focused most of their spies ' efforts , and spent most of their intelligence budgets , on each other . <P> The cold war competition has evaporated , but the world has not necessarily grown safer . While the West no longer lives in fear of a surprise attack from the Soviet Union , it worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warheads on former Soviet soil might slip into the hands of irresponsible governments or terrorists elsewhere on the planet . More than 25 countries are on the road to building weapons of mass destruction  --  or buying them from those who have too many arms and too little money . Every industrial state is trying to steal another 's high-tech secrets and protect its own . Terrorism is a multifaceted worry , emerging from religious and ethnic conflicts around the globe . Governments  --  whole countries  --  are being subverted by billionaire drug traffickers .
