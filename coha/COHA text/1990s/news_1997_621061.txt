<p> STEWART WAS HERO ON AND OFF SCREEN <p> Editor  --  Those who think people can separate their public and private lives ought to look at the example of Jimmy Stewart . He was real , authentic . Stewart was married to the same woman for 44 years ; he voluntarily put himself on the line for his country in World War II ; he was involved in no scandals ; he had no vices ; he used no vulgar or profane speech ; he spoke ill of no one and he portrayed characters who were people of decency , honesty and integrity . We identified with him because he was each one of us , or at least what each of us aspired to be . And what we wanted our children to be . <p> Contrast that to many of our current political leaders and Hollywood stars : They change spouses like underwear ; their vices are plentiful and notorious ; they are drunkards , adulterers , liars , gamblers and foul-mouthed ; and none of us would ever want our children to imitate them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S BEST LINE <p> Editor  --  I best remember Robert Mitchum in " The Friends of Eddie Coyle " as a grizzled old Boston gangster advising a young , too- eager up-and-comer : " Kid , life 's hard . But it 's a lot harder if you 're stupid . " <p> JEFF ZORN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> TERRY REID , ANYONE ? <p> Editor  --  In regard to Sam Whiting 's article " Yankee Doodle Ditties " ( July 3 ) , I 'm wondering if you can tell me how I can find any Terry Reid records . I have not been able to locate anything by him . The last tapes I have of Reid are from an old KSAN broadcast ( about 1971 ) with Richard Gossett . <p> MICHAEL GALINDO <p> Union City <p> . <p> ANOTHER DITTY <p> Editor  --  Sam Whiting 's " Yankee Doodle Ditties " missed one of the best , John Prine 's Vietnam allegory , " The Great Compromise . " <p> BRIAN LEHMAN <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> DEFENDING LEVITTOWN <p> Editor  --  John Carman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " A Surreal Trip to ' Wonderland , ' " July 7 ) about Levittown . I grew up in a similar community in Anaheim , where a bunch of veterans , to their surprise , could actually own property because of the GI Bill . I remember barbecue block parties around newly installed swimming pools where young men , with their new wives and kids , congratulated themselves on escaping the Depression and the war with their lives . <p> It all looked alike because they were alike . <p> And what is ridiculous about being alike one another ? <p> JON TUCKER <p> Fairbanks , Alaska <p> . <p> IS N'T IT IRONIC <p> Editor  --  This whole irony thing has really gone too far , now , with even Disney joining in ( Peter Stack 's " ' Hercules ' Hipper Than Its Hero , " June 27 ) . From the " classic TV " foisted upon us by Nick at Nite to the latest craze for retro- style martini bars ( or whatever has replaced them this week ) , we are barraged by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotation marks " around " everything " " we " " say " " or " " write " " or " " do " attitude , and I am just sick of it ! It 's time we got real . <p> Irony may have its place , but it 's a hollow place that fails to nourish the soul . Honesty , truth , sincerity  --  these are the attitudes and sensibilities that can lead us to a more fulfilling life . <p> Irony is getting boring these days . Everyone does it . Besides , it does n't work . Whether or not you 're wearing or eating something satirically , in the end , you are actually still downing real martinis , still wasting your time watching 30-year-old reruns of " Bewitched , " still wearing ridiculous clothes and still being roped into buying the action figures , breakfast cereals , plush toys and " Hercules " - ridden products of every description that Disney keeps churning out . <p> Irony has become just another commodity ; Disney et al . have taken the attitude from the supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the masses at $ 7.50 a pop . And that 's when you 're really being snookered , because you 're paying Disney for the privilege of learning that the company is trying to take advantage of you economically . <p> Now , darned if that is n't ironic . <p> SUSAN D. BOROWITZ <p> Davis <p> WHITE WEDDING <p> Editor  --  I was surprised to see a white outfit featured as suitable for a wedding guest ( Sylvia Rubin 's " Style Counsel , " June 19 ) . I thought the No. 1 rule for wedding clothing was never to wear white unless you were the bride . Is this not correct ? <p> JO ELLEN ZEMBSCH <p> Berkeley <p> Peggy Post , author of " Emily Post 's Etiquette , " replies : <p> A lot of people still are rather horrified that any woman other than the bride would wear white to a wedding , but it 's all right , if you do so appropriately . Historically it has been a tradition that female guests not wear white or black ; those guidelines have relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the guidelines have been relaxed , they have n't gone away entirely . It 's more a question of style than color ; you should not try to look like the bride or compete with the bride . <p> . <p> DEFENDING REEVES <p> Editor  --  It amuses me that your film reviewers can so disagree upon the merits ( or lack thereof ) of Keanu Reeves . Two years ago " A Walk in the Clouds " premiered to a most favorable review by The Chronicle  --  in fact , the reviewer managed to offer an apology for whatever disparaging remarks had been previously printed regarding Reeves ' work . An earlier and more notable film , " My Own Private Idaho , " was a summer art-house blockbuster in 1991 , and one can only assume that it was well received by the paper . Both films offer complex , valid portrayals of three-dimensional characters , played with depth and emotion by Reeves . <p> I wo n't protest Edward Guthmann 's review ( " ' Suicide ' Ca n't Quite Capture Cassady 's Charisma , " July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not yet seen the film . However , such generalized remarks discredit this reviewer in my eyes . Obviously , Guthmann prefers inane , vacuous action thrillers ( with or without Reeves ' help ) and discounts the need for all young actors to learn their craft . Leaving better parts " to the pros " just wo n't work here . <p> JUDI THOMAS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' SATCHMO ' TRIBUTE <p> Editor  --  Jesse Hamlin 's July 4 tribute ( " Satchmo 's Wonderful World " ) to " Satchmo " touched an emotional nerve . Armstrong 's horn and voice ( including gravel ) have been among my deepest musical experiences . Particularly " It 's a Wonderful Day "  --  when I hear it on the radio or even in a commercial , my world stops and I must hear it out . Something about the simple melody and childlike lyrics of optimism and love haunt me . <p> STANLEY DIAMOND <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CARTOON MURDERS <p> Editor  --  At the movies this week I was treated to a preview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be released in November . <p> While I am no great fan of the Romanovs , and " Bloody Nicholas " would surely not have approved of me , I was disturbed at the idea of this film and the presumable ancillary marketing of coloring books , toys and tchotchkes to children . The story is based on a real historical incident involving the real murder of real children . Some of the real relatives are still living . <p> What can we look forward to next ? Another cartoon about a dead teenage girl ? Preteens asking each other , " Have you seen ' Anne Frank ' yet ? It 's really cool ! " <p> SUSAN WEISS <p> Daly City <p> . <p> GRATEFUL TO WRAY <p> Editor  --  I would like to thank James Sullivan for his July 7 arti cle ( " Wray 's a Link to the Future " ) about Link Wray . I thought Wray 's appearance would go unnoticed by the print media . Thanks for proving me wrong . <p> Anyone who listens to hard rock or heavy metal owes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation with his 1958 hit " Rumble . " <p> NEAL A. HAIGHT <p> Castro Valley <p> . <p> SETI GODFATHER <p> Editor  --  It would have improved your writer 's credibility ( Peter Stack 's " SETI Star-Bound in ' Contact , ' " July 8 ) had he revealed that the late , great Barney Oliver , vice president of research and development at Hewlett-Packard until he retired , was director of the SETI program before Jill Tarter ( who may or may not have mentioned him  --  we have no way to know ) . Oliver 's technological innovations are SETI 's engine today . If SETI succeeds he should receive credit . <p> JOHN JOSS <p> Los Altos <p> . <p> TEEN ANGST <p> Editor  --  I am 15 years old , and the one thing I know best is the so- called " pint-sized lament " James Sullivan wrote about ( " Baby 's Got the Blues , " June 13 ) . Teens write about misery because that 's how they feel . Where has everyone been for the past 50 years ? <p> Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has someone just now realized that teens today are filled with angst ? <p> MELISSA COX <p> Alameda <p> Address all correspondence to : Letters to Daily Datebook , San Francisco Chronicle , 901 Mission St. , San Francisco , Calif. 94103 , or e-mail us at Datebook@sfgate.com .
