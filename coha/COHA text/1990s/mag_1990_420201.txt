Section : LIFESTYLE TELEVISION Hail and hallelujah ! Five years in the making , 11 hours in length , a new PBS documentary series turns the Civil War into unforgettable television . <p> Let 's put it right at the head of the lead column , where the flags and the bugles once went . Public television is about to unfurl a documentary masterpiece . Actually , to call " The Civil War " a documentary seems too limiting . This 11-hour series , airing on PBS for five consecutive nights beginning Sept. 23 , qualifies as a kind of video miracle . Without access to a single frame of battle footage , without resort to hokey reenactments or docu-drama inventions , it takes the nation 's most cataclysmic act of self-definition and brings it hauntingly and wondrously alive . PBS has added another jewel to its crown , only this one was made  --  truly made-in the U.S. of A. <p> A bit of history : in 1984 , an acclaimed young documentary filmmaker named Ken Burns came to an unsettling realization . He noticed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long , the Shakers or the Brooklyn Bridge ) had in some way been shaped by the Civil War . To understand why that was unsettling , you need to know that Burns is a card-carrying obsessive . If he were to do the war , he would have to do all of it , as it had never been done , at least on a screen . Friends warned him off . " They said it would swallow me whole , " he recalls . " I said I did n't think it would come to that . " This time Burns went beyond obsession . He thought wrong . He became positively possessed by his subject , toiling 15-hour days for the next five years  --  longer than the Civil War itself . <p> Hardly a minute appears wasted . For his epic 's visuals , Burns did n't simply raid the photo archives , though he did use thousands of black-and-white images of the combatants . ( Incidentally , why do n't they make faces like these anymore ? They seem to blaze with character . ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines , even period signs and handbills . Most effectively , Burns filmed many of the now placid battlefields at the precise hour of the day on which the engagements took place . By ingeniously mixing pan shots with zoom close-ups , by having his cameras gallop over a ridge or lurch in terror through a woods  --  and then flash to photographic evidence of the carnage-he plunges us directly inside the horror . <p> Ironically , it 's the sounds rather than the images that strike most movingly . In part , that 's a product of Burns 's obsession with authenticity . The artillery cannonades and Rebel yells , the black spirituals and camp songs ( a Union favorite pleaded " Kiss Me Before I Die , Mother " )  --  all emerge from history through exhaustively exact research . Burns even made certain that the birdcalls signaling a battle 's dawn were those actually heard on that morning . But it 's the words that sing most truly , words drawn from the diaries of the spear carriers as well as the journals of the renowned . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island volunteer , the other by a Tennessee private named Sam Watkins , serve as the series ' twin narrative tent poles . Rhodes and Watkins seemed to pop up everywhere , and their unvarnished recollections speak more eloquently about the conflict than a hundred scholarly accounts . <p> To read us the words , Burns enlisted a remarkably eclectic cast of off-camera voices . The selections of Sam Waterston ( as Abraham Lincoln ) , Jason Robards ( UlyssesS . Grant ) and Morgan Freeman ( Frederick Douglass ) may not seem especially daring . But only a Burns would reach for Arthur Miller ( William T. Sherman ) , Jody Powell ( Stonewall Jackson ) , Garrison Keillor ( Walt Whitman ) , Studs Terkel ( Union Gert . Benjamin F. Butler ) and , for a perfect echo of the Northern aristocracy , George Plimpton ( New York diarist George Templeton Strong ) . Among the half-dozen historians who function as on-camera tour guides , none is more captivating than Shelby Foote , the Mississippi-born author of a definitive trilogy on the Civil War . By turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attuned to the period he might have ridden alongside Lee . " It was the crossroads of our being , " he says of the war , " and it was a hell of a crossroads . " <p> Rifle balls : Like all great historical works , Burns 's saga constantly switches its perspective and focus . The war 's major events are rendered masterfully enough to stand as their own self-contained mini-films . We can almost feel the rifle balls strike flesh at Shiloh , Antietam and Cold Harbor , where 7,000 men fell in 20 minutes . We marvel at the clash of the ironclads Monitor and Metrimack , sprung to life by photographic quick cuts , booming cannons and vivid writing ( the Monitor , recalled one observer , looked like " a floating shingle with a cheesebox rising from its center " ) . We join Pickett 's splendid charge at Gettysburg and instantly understand Lee 's horrendous error in permitting it . We grieve with the nation as Lincoln 's funeral train carries him home to Springfield . <p> Small moments , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rout at Bull Run , a doomed soldier penned a love letter to his wife that , as reread here , should stimulate the most calcified tear ducts . Throughout the series , narrator David McCullough drenches us in a rain of chilling facts . The last corpse had hardly left Bull Run when real-estate speculators snatched up parts of the battlefield as a tourist attraction ... The Union ranks contained more than 100,000 soldiers who were not yet 15 ... One fifth of the state of Mississippi 's entire budget was spent on artificial limbs . Equally depressing was the political infighting that nearly sabotaged the Northern cause . Writing to his wife , Gen. George McClellan described his cornmander in chief as " the original gorilla.What a specimen to be at the head of our affairs now . " No wonder Lincoln was moved to conclude : " If there 's a worse place than hell , I 'm in it . " <p> Just when the war 's details begin to pall , Burns widens his lens to examine the conflict 's societal impact . The demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside information , the complaints against a prying media and an unfair military draft all took root in the Civil War 's massive footprint . None receives more illuminating treatment than the long-ignored contributions of black soldiers . Picking up what the theatrical film " Glory " left out , this documentary movingly tracks the journey of American blacks from victimized bystanders to proud , self-sacrificing participants . At the war 's start , we learn , one out of seven Americans was owned by another . By the war 's end , blacks made up 10 percent of the Union Army  --  though they comprised less than i percent of the North 's population . What went on inbetween , and its implications for both races , is largely told through first-person accounts of the slaves turned soldiers . One , on spotting his former owner among Confederate prisoners , called out : " Hello , massa . Bottom rail on top this time ! " <p> I 'm weary ' : The irony of asking viewers to endure one war on PBS while they confront the possibility of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sees a timely parallel : " In our very first episode , you witness the rabid enthusiasm to go off to war . And you hear that now , you hear the same thing . Perhaps by being concerned about the Shilohs , we can avoid the Iraqs . " Perhaps , but that 's hardly why a General Motors would sign on as the series ' sole corporate underwriter . " Everything about ' The Civil War ' , " explains a spokesman for the automaker , " is quality driven . " <p> Will viewers with only a modest interest in this history lesson sit though five straight nights of it ? That could depend on whether they regard its ending as a happy one . Shelby Foote certainly thinks so . " Before the war , " he tells us , " people said , ' The United States are . ' After the war , they said , ' The United States is ' . " One Confederate combatant sounds somewhat less approving : " My shoes are gone , my clothes are gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry ... I love my country , but if this war is ever over , I 'll be damned if I ever love another country . " Ken Burns , though still boyishlooking at 36 , suffered his own form of over-exposure . " I 've been having these horrendous dreams , in which I 'm half directing a battle and half fighting in it , " he says . " Sometimes I actually get shot in the eye . " <p> Near the documentary 's conclusion , we learn that once the war had ended , Americans no longer wanted its photographic records . Many were sold to gardeners  --  for the glass plates in their negatives . In the years after Appomattox , the sun gradually burned the images of war from thousands of greenhouse panes . Of course , thousands of other images survived . Thanks to the man with the ocular nightmares , they 've never shone more brilliantly . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Magnificent obsession : Foote ( left ) , Burns <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bringing an unfilmed war to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pickett 's charge at Gettysburg , diarists Watkins ( left ) and Rhodes speak for the troops <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Watkins <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Rhodes <p> BY HARRY F.
