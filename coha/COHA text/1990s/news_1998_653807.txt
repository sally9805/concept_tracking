<p> WHEN he heard that insurers planned to raise liability rates for sport utility vehicles , David Gregorino was incensed . <p> Mr. Gregorino , 42 , a sales agent in Charlotte , N.C. , who drives a full-size Chevrolet Tahoe , called his insurer and insurance industry officials to complain . He even wants to attend any crash tests of sport utilities and cars . Bigger vehicles , he says , do not pose a safety problem . <p> " You buy a vehicle to protect yourself and they 're going to charge you more " for insurance , Mr. Gregorino said angrily . <p> Such outspoken opposition has caused insurers to pause in their plans to raise liability insurance rates for sport utilities and pickup trucks while cutting rates for cars and mini-vans . <p> Since the first reports five months ago of the industry 's intentions , sport utility owners have bombarded insurers with letters , denounced them on Internet message boards and castigated them on talk radio shows . Conversely , drivers of cars and mini-vans who would benefit from lower liability rates have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to makes quick changes to their auto liability rates . " If there is some political will to do this then we might change our minds , but right now our folks are running scared , " said an official at a large insurer who spoke on the condition of anonymity . <p> If anything , Mr. Gregorino believes , more people should drive sport utilities . What built this conviction was an accident involving his wife , Jane , three years ago . She suffered only a shoulder injury when a Toyota Tercel slid sideways into her Chevrolet Blazer . <p> Yet the crash was far from an unqualified endorsement of sport utilities . When asked what happened to the Tercel 's 18-year-old driver , Mr. Gregorino paused for a moment , then replied , " He died three days later , " of injuries received in the accident . <p> " Had he been in a more substantial , safe vehicle , he might not have been killed , " Mr. Gregorino argued . <p> Research this winter by Federal regulators has found that sport utilities are nearly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other vehicle in a crash . <p> Insurance industry research has also found that sport utilities do surprisingly little to reduce the death rate for their own occupants . The vehicles roll over so often when they hit curbs and other objects that their death rate in single-vehicle crashes is 46 percent higher than for cars , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , which is financed by insurers seeking to reduce the cost of accident claims . <p> Meanwhile , the Highway Loss Data Institute , which is also supported by insurers , has determined that the annual cost of property damage liability claims for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks is substantially higher than those for cars and mini-vans . <p> Two of the nation 's biggest insurers , the Progressive Corporation and the Farmers Insurance Group , have found from their own records that sport utility vehicles and pickups cause a disproportionately large share of their payments on liability policies . Both insurers have been raising liability rates for such vehicles while cutting those for cars and mini-vans . <p> In Pennsylvania and Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on car liability rates by charging 5 to 16 percent extra for sport utilities and pickups . <p> With interest growing in the issue , the New York State Assembly Task Force on Auto Insurance has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to review the matter , though no bill has been drafted for consideration . <p> Ivan C. Lafayette , the Queens Democrat who is the Assembly majority whip , said he was concerned that liability rates for cars might be inflated to cover insurers ' losses on sport utilities and pickups . " Maintaining the same costs for cars that are going to cost less to insure is unfair , " he said . <p> Dr. Ricardo Martinez , a former emergency room physician who is now the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , noted approvingly on Jan. 12 that insurers had begun to adjust liability rates to discourage Americans from buying the most dangerous vehicles . But his comments may have been premature . <p> Most insurers , including the industry leaders , State Farm and Allstate , have decided to leave liability rates unchanged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a driver 's age , gender and driving history , but not the vehicle model . <p> By contrast , insurers charge less for collision insurance on sport utility vehicles than for similarly priced cars . Sport utilities suffer less damage in crashes , and collision insurance is adjusted for make and model . <p> So a suburban woman with no history of traffic tickets or crashes , for example , typically pays the same liability rates whether she buys a three-ton sport utility vehicle or a similarly priced car that weighs half as much . But the collision insurance rates would be lower for the sport utility . <p> Profits from insuring car drivers allow insurers to cover their liability losses on sport utilities . " The regular car drivers are subsidizing S.U.V. and pickup drivers on liability insurance , " said Diane S. Tasaka , a spokeswoman for Farmers Insurance . <p> Farmers , the nation 's third-largest auto insurer , has begun adjusting liability insurance by vehicle model only in Pennsylvania and Maryland , two states where it has only just begun doing business . Farmers has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility vehicle drivers would not renew their policies . Progressive , the nation 's fifth-largest auto insurer and the fastest growing , adjusts liability rates nationwide . <p> But State Farm , the nation 's biggest auto insurer , has consistently opposed adjusting its liability rates , while Allstate , the second largest , has become less enthusiastic about adjusting rates in recent months . <p> Last fall , Michael A. LaMonica , Allstate 's vice president for auto insurance pricing , said he was alarmed by the proliferation of full-size sport utility vehicles like the Ford Expedition . He envisioned , he said , a new system of liability rates that would reflect the greater damage and injuries that a big vehicle can inflict . <p> Allstate has since reviewed its data and has decided to take no immediate action , Mr. LaMonica said earlier this month . Liability policy claims are higher for sport utility vehicles than for cars , he said . But Allstate found that part of the extra cost is offset by collision insurance costs that have turned out to be even lower than expected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility vehicles on accident claims is not so great that Allstate needs to raise liability rates immediately , Mr. LaMonica said . " We 're not out of balance to the point that we feel like we have to do it right now , " he said , adding that Allstate may adjust liability rates within the next five years , but not this year . <p> OTHER insurers say that raising rates for sport utility vehicles is particularly difficult because the owners of these vehicles tend to be affluent , politically active people who will not hesitate to call their state regulators and lawmakers . <p> Many owners of sport utility vehicles also buy homeowner and life policies from their auto insurer . Some insurers fear that they may lose clients in many lines of business if they move more quickly than their rivals to adjust auto liability rates , said Steven Goldstein , a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute , an industry group . <p> When asked , the relatives of people killed in collisions with sport utilities tend to say that liability rates should be raised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so double the premium , " said Wanda B. Mange , a ski resort receptionist in Conway , Mich . Her 16-year-old daughter , Alexandria , and her 15-year-old friend , Emily Hoffman , were killed last May when a Ford Explorer hit the side of Alexandria 's Ford Taurus . Sheriff 's deputies concluded that Alexandria had precipitated the accident by failing to yield at an intersection . <p> Mrs. Mange said she still had another year of loan payments to make on the 10-year-old Taurus , which she had bought used and which was destroyed in the crash . But while she is convinced that insurance rates should be increased for sport utilities , Mrs. Mange said , she had not contacted any insurers or regulators about it . <p> Leslie Santora , a lawyer in Union , N.J. , lost her 37-year-old brother , Gregory , after his 1995 Pontiac Bonneville was hit last summer in Lakewood , N.J. , by a 1979 Ford Bronco . The Bronco , according to the police , crossed the center line . Like Mrs. Mange , Ms. Santora favors changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think they should be higher for sport utilities because it would get some of them off the road , " she said . <p> Insurers said rates might change eventually but were unlikely to change quickly unless car owners spoke up or started moving to insurers offering lower rates . <p> " I really wish we had heard from consumers who are car owners , " said the insurance official who spoke on condition of anonymity . " It 's only the people who are dissatisfied that we hear from .
