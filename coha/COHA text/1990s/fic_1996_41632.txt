The Ivy League is a short haircut . The sides and back are buzzed , and the top is just long enough to comb . It makes Kenny look like the boy in the school portraits his mother props on the mantle . Also like some California surfer our friend Missy fell in love with . <p> Lately , Kenny 's been going for haircuts every Saturday , and I 've been keeping him company . Soon we 'll hear from colleges , and Kenny 's hoping these haircuts will bring him luck . He 's also hoping to play ball next year , and so Saturdays after the barber , we always look to hoop . Kenny can play-he practices-but he still ca n't make the high school varsity . He 's just not the complete package that some kids are . Because no matter how good he gets , he 's got no hops , and already that 's a skill you need to play on the team . <p> We checked the Northwestern courts-locked . The church gym-closed for Christmas . And I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many busters there wanted to kill him . <p> We pounded on the emergency door at the Y until someone snuck us in . Games were running full . We recognized a big guy from our school named Charles Wormfeld , the type of cocky guy Kenny 's always looking to beat . <p> Of course the trouble with Charles starts straight off . It starts because Charles is a hack , and Kenny keeps calling him " Charles the Worm Worm Wormfeld , " and taking the ball to the hole . So first time Charles swats Kenny 's shot , Charles goes , " Get that shit out of here , " and pounds his hairy chest like the ape that he is . Kenny glares up . " Do n't do that , " he says quietly . " Not if you 're going to foul me every other time . Do n't talk smack , too . " <p> " So what are you going to do if I do , little man ? " Charles says , and that 's when the oglers circle up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . I yell , " Come on , Kenny , time to go . " But Kenny does n't answer . Already he 's got his arms spread , palms open , face right in Charles 's face . Then Kenny smiles and shakes his head . Charles thinks that 's it then , because he smiles and shakes his head , too , which is exactly when Kenny drops him-opens that can of whoop ass-and down Charles goes . <p> I do n't know if any of the other guys are Charles 's friends , but I throw the chair , anyway , just in case . People will clear off when you throw a chair , and it was getting so this was our routine : Kenny going wild , me throwing something big to get him out of there . <p> We jumped in Kenny 's mom 's black Beemer , and I was screaming , " The fuck are you doing ? Always fucking shit up . " <p> Kenny had us in drive and was looking seriously apologetic , swerving through the parking lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry . He just pissed me off . I get so mad . " And on the steering wheel I could see his knuckles laid out and flexing , the splits above his middle two fingers opening and closing like little pink fish mouths . <p> Two blocks later , Kenny broke left . <p> " It 's his house over here , right ? " <p> " Whose house ? " <p> " Charles the Worm Worm Wormfeld 's . You know , right up here , right ? " <p> " Oh , man , Kenny , I do n't know . " <p> Kenny pulled in behind a garage with a hoop above the door . How he knew this was Charles 's , I had no idea . <p> " Now just be cool now , " Kenny said , and he dug the tire iron out from the trunk and balanced on the roof of the Beemer to pry Charles 's rim off . Two minutes later it was ours-that is , Charles 's pretty rim had ripped free-and we 're bombing north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sunroof like a trophy . <p> Kenny 's basement is mostly cement , and it 's where his father used to see clients back in the 1970 's . Now that he 's set in his downtown office , it 's become Kenny 's unofficial bedroom , still sporting the black leather couch , orange carpet , and macrame wall hangings from when Kenny 's mom redecorated the upstairs den . Most of the stuff we 've somehow managed to break , or scorch , or in some way mar-there 's silver duct tape on nearly everything-but Mr. and Mrs. Sharf never snoop down here , and it 's funny because just above us , the Sharfs ' house is full of these really nice rooms where it always feels like the cleaning lady 's just been . <p> I squirted Bactine on Kenny 's knuckles , and he bit the neck of his shirt , even though I did n't think it could hurt as bad as he was making it seem . <p> " Okay , " I said , " you 're good to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and we watched rap videos and did bong hits until Mrs. Sharf called from somewhere in the yard . <p> " Kenny , your father wants you to rake the leaves up . Kenny , can you hear me ? " <p> Kenny made a face , did n't bother to stash the pipe . He yelled , " Mom , it 's gon na snow . " <p> " Kenny , your father says he 'd like you to rake the leaves . We 're having company . Kenny ? " <p> " Fucking Christ , " Kenny said to me . " Like , no kidding . " <p> So we raked , squinty-eyed and mellow , and in the middle of raking , the snow commenced to filter down . <p> " You see , " Kenny said , ripping at the leaves with his rake . " This is exactly the shit they pull all the time . Do you see what I mean ? It 's snowing . I said it would be snowing . " <p> " So let 's stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raking these leaves . " <p> And so that 's what he did-raked through the flakes-and I helped him , both of us just in our thin sweatshirts because Kenny wanted his parents to feel bad for making us cold . And just to make sure they noticed , Kenny lit the leaf pile on fire instead of bagging it , and we stood around the smoldering little heap just waiting , a wind cutting through us , tiny wet snow crystals melting on our skin . <p> Nothing changes , I thought . When Kenny was ten , he torched the upstairs den , and his parents did n't even yell or ground him . They just gave him the basement , his own space , a move which , I guess , I can understand . The basement is n't too flammable . It 's got access to the yard . And it 's a place for Kenny to be instead of picking fights on basketball courts after school . <p> My mother brought my good clothes over along with the salmon pate she brings to this party every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were milling with drinks . My mother met me in the kitchen , eyes bugging like she 'd never seen me before in such ratty gym clothes . She turned to a withered lady in a shiny green dress . " Honestly , " my mother said . " From the look of him , you 'd think we did n't have money to buy him clothes . " <p> I took my things to the upstairs bathroom , and by the time I was dressed in what my mother thought appropriate-blue Dockers with too many pleats , white oxford , red sweater vestmost of the other kids had arrived . I could tell because I saw their parents . Saw my father , too , in a pack of other fathers by the bar . He raised his drink and motioned me over . I played dumb , waved once , hustled back down to Kenny 's private space . <p> Some nights , maybe after a fight , or a car crash , or a particularly bad loss by the Bulls , you could find ten kids down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the event . Terry Mayday shot Brad Grinnel 's dog . Richard Hoffman smacked the clerk at 7-Eleven . Who knows if we were any different from any other groups of friends . But people were always showing up . Everyone knew the way . <p> This holiday thing was like a reunion . Kenny , Missy , and Betsey Nelson-back from Skidmore College with a bouncy new hairdo-were playing slap-n-flinch when I walked in . Big , Lumpy , Hollywood , Billy Boo the millionaire bike thief , a guy called Dish because of his big ears , and a few of the other clowns from our school were swilling champagne on the sofa . My man Ross Meyers and his girlfriend , Naomi , showed up-first time ever-and Ross was walking around nodding , going , " So this is Christmas , yesss , I likes , I likes , I likes . " And up above you could here the grown-ups shifting chairs and slurping eggnog and munching ham to the tune of " White Christmas . " <p> Missy was so wrecked . Eyes half-closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled them on top . So now Kenny was concentrating on Betsey , who , at the moment , was examining his knuckles . " Do they hurt very much ? Was it a very bad fight ? " Missy stepped between them . " I want to hit , " she said and stuck out her lip . <p> " You have to win first , " Kenny said . " You need practice , you really do . You 're not at all fast . In fact , you 're slow . Merry Christmas and all , but you 're slow . " <p> Missy spun in place and careened toward me , mouth glistening , hands held out . Her perfume smelled like maraschino cherries , and I rested my big paws on her soft palms and let her go off , huge drunken slaps to the backs of my hands . I 'd known Missy since ninth grade , when she moved here pregnant from San Pedro , California , and Kenny , even though he was n't responsible , sold stolen Polo shirts from Marshall Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to talk about it . <p> In the middle of the room , Kenny and Betsey kept playing , hands lifted so that if you did n't know better , you 'd think they were rehearsing for some formal dance . Kenny looked so cleancut over there , khakis cuffed just above the scoop of his shoes . I could see what girls could see in him . He had a presence , and he had this room . Missy pressed against me . I wrapped my arm around her and patted my pocket . " Got a card for you . " <p> " You 're sweet , " she said , still paying attention to Kenny and Betsey . " You know I do n't owe him anything , " she whispered . " I do n't care if it is Christmas . " And then she stalked off in her tight little skirt , with her short shapely legs , into the room where the lights do n't work and where Kenny 's father keeps his unused tools . From the sofa , Billy Boo offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he winked and nodded toward the toolroom . <p> " She 's not like that anymore , " I told him . <p> He waved his hand at me , knocked back his champagne , and went after Missy , the thought of which-the two of them tanked and slobbery-made me sick . <p> I wandered out the storm door and into the backyard , where the new slushy snow lay barely an inch deep and the blocks of light stretched from the Sharfs ' kitchen windows across the pale muck . Missy had n't asked for her card , and now it felt heavy enough to drag my pants down . The air was turning colder , and on either side I could see inside Kenny 's neighbors ' lighted homes . On the left you had the O'Donnells in their hardwooded den , cocktail city , the whole clan seated before a huge , gaudy tree . On the right you had Mr. and Ms. Berkowitz in the kitchen with their three slouchy sons , everybody snarfing , heaps of food . And with all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out there or had any idea of what I felt capable of doing . <p> I made a snowball , squeezed it tight , then added more snow and squeezed again until I had a fat , hefty ice-ball . I edged around to the front of Kenny 's house , leaned in the shadow of the porch , cold pinching my lungs and stinging my fingers , not a single thing moving on the sidewalk or street . The first car that passed , I blasted it , fired a strike , and then listened for the hollow smack as I bolted back to the bright lights and red faces of my best friends . <p> Kenny was in a corner , flashing bills , probably giving away money , which is something he had a tendency to do . Ross was imitating a fight ref and doing the rules for Christmas dinner : " No turkey football . No drinking from the baster . If you got ta gnaw from the bone , you take it outside . " <p> As for Billy Boo , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood was saying . I saw him sniff his fingers and then let Hollywood sniff his fingers , and I felt sick all over again . Where was Missy ? I did n't see her anywhere . Then I looked to the toolroom , and there she was , stumbling out of the darkness like a horror-film lady , hair mussed , big breasts hanging free , thick , ugly blood bubbling down her left wrist . She threw a drywall knife at Kenny and Betsey and streaked past us , out and into the snow . <p> We had to tackle her and cover her mouth to keep her quiet . Kenny squeezed her wrist and held it up while me , Ross , and Big dragged her back downstairs . Then Kenny held her still while I pasted on about fifty Band-Aids . She 'd made a mess of her arm , mauled the skin up , but not too deeply and not vertically along the vein the way her friend Julie Fisher had . I squirted Bactine on top of the Band-Aids and helped Kenny dress her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of her heavy cold breasts , one at a time , to get them set in her bra . Her blouse went on easier . Naomi smuggled down a bright red sweater-from where I did n't know-and we put that on her , too , just in case some blood leaked through at church . The whole time , Billy Boo kept shaking his head , mumbling , " Sorry , Missy , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " <p> Finally Kenny just snapped , " It 's not your fault already , Bill , so just shut up . " <p> Missy smiled then , and I wondered if she knew what was happening or who was involved . She never once opened her eyes . And when it came time for midnight mass , we all rode with our parents , in separate cars , except for Kenny , who said he 'd ride with Missy and her mom . <p> The priest called out , " By the light of the redeeming love , " and we all answered , " Fill our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say in the program . <p> We were sitting in back , or at least near the back , and we 'd downed so many drinks that even with Missy there leaning woozily on Kenny 's shoulder , looking faded , we somehow felt loopy and ready to giggle . Everything was just so ridiculous : all our trim , good-hearted parents in bright outfits , every last one of them clueless and loaded to the gills . You knew it soon as you stomped in , soon as one of the dads took your coat and pumped your hand , smelling of pipe smoke , green Tic-Tacs , and underneath it all reeking of gin . <p> The thing that fucked us up was Kenny 's tie . We were standing to sing , and when we sat , Kenny 's tie flopped over the pew in front of him , and a fat lady leaned back against it . Kenny was pinned . He had to bend forward and turn his head , and everybody had to bite their lips to keep from laughing . I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds started to jiggle out of me , and I squeezed fast toward the aisle . <p> A minute later , Kenny met me down in the gym , where we rolled on the floor and laughed so hard we could n't make noise . The backboards loomed like friendly ghosts . Kenny kicked his shoes off and balled his socks . <p> " Quick game of sock ball ? " <p> " I 'll kill you . " <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> " I think so . " <p> Just then , Kenny 's father flicked up the lights . <p> " Is there a problem here , Kenny ? " he said , squinting into the new new brightness . <p> " No problem , Dad , " Kenny said , loudly . <p> " Well , then , what are you two doing here ? I mean , your mother and I were wondering about you upstairs . " <p> Kenny shrugged , and Mr. Sharf looked sad to have to be asking us stupid questions . After a minute or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted his mouth into a grin . " Think I made him mad ? " I stared at the floor , Kenny 's bare feet , and then the next thing that happens is Kenny 's peeing . It 's the gym in our church . <p> " Why , Kenny ? " I said . " Why ? " <p> I walked home with Ross and Naomi so I would n't have to face my parents or Kenny or anyone else that would set me off . Out on the street , our footsteps crunched , and the air smelled of pine smoke , and all the big homes winked with tiny lights . So we were walking . Ross and Naomi said they thought mass was cool-so much incense ! so much singing ! - and now they wanted to try hanging an actual ornament on an actual tree . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " You have to do it just right . " I was trying to goof on our whole situation , trying to forget about Missy 's bloody wrist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ on the cross . I just wanted to enjoy who I was with and what we were doing . But it was hard . Like we had to walk past so many familiar streets , so many houses of the friends we 'd known forever , and especially past Missy 's mom 's dinky flat with the twostep porch and the dark spooky windows that made me worry . Missy 's card was in my pocket . " Hold on , " I said . " Can we . . . I mean , do either of you have a pen ? " <p> Naomi patted her pockets and searched her coat and came up with a red felt-tip . " It 'll do , " I said . " Two minutes . " And I hustled up to Missy 's and stood there shaking while I ripped open the envelope and took out her card . It was just a silly Hallmark on which I 'd written , " Love , Santa . " Now I x-ed out the Santa part and penned in KENNY . The porch wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was that . <p> My mother was up waiting when we reached my house . I did n't have my keys . She was in her nightgown , and she had a champagne bottle in her hand . She pressed her face to the door glass and said we could n't come in . <p> " Mom , come on . " I was embarrassed in front of Ross and Naomi , embarrassed that this was my mother and that this was Christmas . " Mom , they just want to see the tree , and then we 'll go out . " <p> My mother waved the bottle and shook her head . " Nooooo . I 'm in my nightgown , pumpkin . " <p> I apologized to Ross and Naomi and ran around back . " Mom , open the door . Mom ! I 'm serious , they just want to see the tree . Five minutes . Seriously . We 're going to leave in five minutes : ' <p> " I 'm in my nightgown , sweetie : ' <p> " Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want a whole herd of your friends traipsing through my house in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve when I 'm in my nightgown . Now , do n't make me wake your father . " <p> " Mom . Let me . The fuck . In " <p> " No , Philip . " <p> I ran to the front . Ross and Naomi looked scared . I did n't care . I climbed like a madman-up the small pine beside our porch , up the porch roof 's slanted shingles-toward the window . Down the hall , I could see my mother flying toward me , flimsy robe billowing out behind . At the window she locked the lock and stuck out her tongue . <p> " Fucking bitch , " I screamed , and I put my foot through the glass to kick her teeth in . <p> She shrieked . A light popped on in the hallway behind her , and I wrung down the tree , scraping my hands and bicycling my feet . A dog was barking . Houselights were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then I fell and scraped my palms and just waited , kneeling , for Ross and Naomi to catch up . <p> We were all breathing hard . Naomi gave me a tissue . Ross made a soft , low whistle . " Merry Christmas ? " he said , and we all laughed a little and then walked on , in an awkward silence , breathing dragon smoke , sliding and skittish , heading for the best place we knew to go . <p> A flaming meteor had landed , and aliens had stamped down the snow around Missy 's blood . <p> " Something 's burning , " Ross said . " A bonfire . " <p> And he was right . All this crap from Kenny 's basement was piled in the backyard-a heap of flames-smelling of melting plastic . We could see the flickering shadows from the alley , and we hurried past them , past the black leather couch growing soggy , and down through the storm door to Kenny 's big room , where the lights were blazing . <p> Kenny had cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped up the carpet , and the walls were stripped clean except at one end , where he 'd tacked up Charles Wormfeld 's hoop with huge spikes , right into the foundation . A sledgehammer lay on the floor , and the wall had a lot of crumbly holes in it where you could see Kenny must have missed what he meant to hit . The basement ceiling was low , and the hoop was even lower , and Kenny was running back and forth , sweating through his church clothes , sprinting from one end of the room to the other , sprinting , planting , leaping . He had a deflated basketball that he could palm . He was jamming . And for a minute we just watched in awe while Kenny rattled the rim with windmilling monster dunks . <p> He saw us , smiled , took off again to tear the house down . <p> I said , " Come on , Kenny , let 's put this thing out . " <p> Kenny 's eyes looked feverish , and he swept his arm out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood everywhere . I could n't clean it up . " He was leaning under Charles 's hoop , squeezing the ball . <p> " Okay , whatever , " I said . " Come on now , Ken . I mean , I mean , this is some shit . " <p> Naomi tugged gently on Kenny 's arm , and Ross held the door open , and after some head-shaking , Kenny let himself be led up the slippery wet steps and into the yard , where the flames were still flaming . Nothing seemed obvious . We had to huddle together and stare while we wondered about exactly what to do . There was this smoldering mound , our problem , this circle of light , and then just beyond it , at the edge of Kenny 's yard , there was this dim blackness . We could n't stay warm . Kenny kept stamping his feet and turning to look up at his parents ' dark window . Meanwhile the snow had stopped falling , and God or someone had shook the stars out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbors would think if they noticed us , four kids standing together before a stinky blue flame . Would we look like we were roasting chestnuts ? Would we resemble , in any way , a small family ? <p>
