WHY CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN ? You may as well ask , why Christmas ? Why birthday parties ? Why fun in general ? Halloween is a celebration of life , like all the other special days , but quite unique . It has delightfully mixed , rather disreputable beginnings . It originated as the Celtic Feast of Samhain . Their calendar year was based on the agricultural one , so the end of October was the end of their year . Thus , the Feast of Samhain was both a New Year 's celebration and a time to purge the land of demons and evil spirits before the long , dark winter set in . The Church attempted to replace this ritual around 800 A.D. with the three - day " Hallow - Tide , " a holy time dedicated to remembering the Christian dead , and praying for their help . But All Hallow 's Eve remained essentially pagan , and medieval men and women continued to light fires around their fields and keep lanterns lit in their homes . October 31st was the night the dead returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then only a fool would have none . Halloween has obviously changed . Farmers may not light bonfires around their fields , but some people , small people to be exact , still hold hands nervously , jump at a sudden rush of wind , and taste some of that primitive excitement , and even fear . My three - year - old could tell you , had he the words , exactly what Halloween is in the late 20th century . Halloween is the fun of planning a special costume , be it amazing or scary or beautiful . It is the fun of taking a family trip to the market to choose the perfect pumpkin , and the ritual of turning a rather fat , lumpy vegetable into a half - human thing with flickering candlelit eyes . It is the traditional pie - making from this creation , and the buying or making of treats to put in a special basket by the front door for all the other children . It is the joy of having your parents really participating , really playing with you in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out into the street after dark , into the buffeting wind and rain . It is the fun and rather frightening transformation of your own tidy street into a wild place of strangely glowing jack - o ' - lanterns , ghouls and clowns on the march , and giggles and screeches in the wind . What will happen when the door opens ? Will there be an endearing preschooler with long rabbit ears , or a teenager dressed as a monster to unnerve you ? Stay close , mom and dad . To a child , Halloween is still , essentially , pagan . No celebration is complete without some sort of food ritual . The over - 12s are Halloween cynics , or pretend to be . They throw on a cheap mask and carry a pillowcase to get as much loot as they possibly can . Their parents and dentists groan . But even they can feel the secret thrill of running in the dark , in the wind , on this mysterious night . I took my son to a few houses when he was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , but he held my old purse open in silent awe to catch the candy . I did n't groan . I ate it . The following year , at 2 1/2 , there was more candy , two pursefuls . He had so much fun alternating between laughter and tight hand - holding , that he insisted upon venturing out a second time . It was the coldest , nastiest night of the whole season , naturally . But after it was over , he spent a happy hour at the coffee table , dry and naked , sorting his candy into lines and circles . I still ate most of it . Certainly there is candy . Who cares ? As parents , we eat it , throw some away , steal it , bargain with our children over it , whatever , but only a true cynic , or a 14 - year - old , thinks that candy is the only reason for Halloween . That is why I do not bring my children to the malls , which now offer a sort of " trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , comfortable , convenient and safe . Sales clerks give out candy to appropriately dressed children . Yech ! What a mundane modern way to kill a great old pagan ritual !
