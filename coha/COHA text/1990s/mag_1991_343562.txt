Talk about chutzpah . Did ITT chairman Rand Araskog deserve the 103% raise that jacked his pay up to $11.4 million last year and made him one of America 's best-paid executives , even though his company 's profits rose just 4% ? No way , say furious investors led by the California Public Employees ' Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension fund . Calpers , which holds 1.15 million shares of ITT stock , or about 1% , is so steamed over Araskog 's raise that it has threatened to vote to oust the company 's directors at the annual meeting next week . <P> An insignificant threat ? On the contrary . Institutions like Calpers  --  pension funds , insurance companies , money-management firms  --  own about 58% of ITT stock and a majority of the shares in dozens of other major U.S. corporations . For decades they have almost always voted for management . If these giants turn activist  --  and they are starting to  --  they will throw a profound scare into executives and directors , potentially revolutionizing their world . <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Explains Calpers chief Dale Hanson : " ITT is not one of the companies that bubble to the top when you think of performance . " That 's putting it mildly . According to Graef S. Crystal , a professor at the Haas Business School at the University of California , Berkeley , ITT 's total return to shareholders during Araskog 's 12- year tenure has been in the bottom 30% of America 's 406 largest companies . Yet over the same period , he notes , Araskog 's compensation has rocketed from a level that was 87 times as great as a blue-collar worker 's to one that is more than 600 times as much . Asserting that Araskog " is one of the most overpaid CEOs in the world , " Crystal blamed ITT directors for having " wasted the company 's assets to a flagrant degree . " <P> ITT replied in a three-page statement that lauded the company 's performance since Araskog became chief executive . He " has literally caused ITT to be transformed over the past decade , " the document says . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling off more than 200 of its 275 subsidiaries . He also helped raise the value of the company 's stock by spending nearly $2 billion to buy back shares . As a result , the statement says , Araskog 's compensation " is at a level which is believed appropriate for bringing to ITT the benefits which have come to the corporation under his stewardship . " <P> Could the discontents topple the ITT board , which , like most boards , is used to being re-elected by an overwhelming margin ? That seems unlikely this year . But the Calpers-led protest could be picking up support . Neuberger &; Berman , a Manhattan firm that manages more ITT stock than any other institution  --  2 million shares  --  is not happy . Wrote Neuberger portfolio manager Marvin Schwartz in a letter to Araskog : " One can not escape noting that ITT stock has been an extremely dismal performer in the marketplace over the past 11-year period . " That sorry record , Schwartz declared , " suggests that knowledgeable institutional investors do not think very highly of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
