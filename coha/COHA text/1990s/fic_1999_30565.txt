7:58 PM , FRIDAY , NOVEMBER 3 LONDON , ENGLAND Julia Austrian was blind . Her blindness was n't caused by birth defect , nor by tragic accident . Instead it was almost as if the hand of God  --  or perhaps Satan  --  had reached into her bedroom while she 'd slept and squeezed the life from her eyes . Her blindness had no known physical cause , the doctors had told her . It was a psychological problem : She was terrified of her audiences . She 'd never gotten used to being blind . Sight was a memory that lingered like a dream , and she ached to be able to see again . So she lied . She told interviewers that being blind was an advantage to a pianist . She told her family she was glad because it enabled her to concentrate on her career . She told the three men she 'd loved that sex was better being blind  --  pure emotion and physicality . There was some truth in her lies . She was on the road a lot throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her manager and her eyes , and together they toured the world of music , from great concert halls to intimate auditoriums , from grand rococo palaces to woodsy county bowls . Critics raved about her power , her beauty of tone , her complete technical command , and her temperament  --  that elusive quality that infused every note with excitement . At home , her wealthy , extended family thought the piano a strange choice for an occupation , but everywhere audiences loved her . It was one of those odd twists of life : She fed an audience 's soul , and they hers . But because of them , she was blind . Her mother  --  Marguerite Austrian  --  was her bulwark through it all . Julia was her only child , and they 'd developed one of those unusually close relationships between adults who have the same blood . They shared love and understanding and an intense insecurity that was rooted in family tragedy . Julia could get sappy about Marguerite . She could weep tears of gratitude for all Marguerite had done for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up to manage her . After all , Julia could have hired people to do that . Wealth was the fix of choice in her family , and Julia was n't shy about applying it whenever necessary . But her mother brushed off her concerns , and with the years Julia began to understand this life of work and travel and being her sighted companion was what her mother wanted . In the end , it always came back to the music . To her father , who 'd recognized the talent in her and had sent her to Juilliard . And to her mother , who not only had made her career possible through the ups and downs but had made much of it a delight  --  practice , concerts , men , touring , her ongoing struggle to do as much as possible for herself , the weight training and jogging that built her muscles so she 'd play as strong as any man . Through the years her self-confidence had grown . Now she felt she could face anything . This Friday night they were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast live on the BBC . The air crackled with excitement , and the scents of expensive perfumes were everywhere . She was eager to play . On the periphery of her consciousness were the whispers of the stagehands as the backstage quieted , while ahead the audience murmured and moved , as restless as a just-tamed beast . But as Julia waited to go on , it was the music that had her attention  --  throbbing through her brain , her fingers aching for the keyboard . She smiled . It was time . " Now , dear . " Her mother 's voice was satin with hints of New York . Julia released her mother 's arm and moved forward . Before a concert , she memorized the path to her piano , and then she walked it alone , without her white cane or tinted glasses or someone 's helpful arm . Over the years , she 'd developed an inner sense of direction that was highly accurate . Anyone could do that . Blindness was very mental  --  your ability to think about what you were perceiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her other inner senses were asleep now , drowned by the soaring notes and complex themes of the tudes she was about to play . Engrossed , driven by her need for her Steinway , she strode through the backstage area . And fell . With staggering suddenness , she walked straight into something , stumbled , and crashed down hard in the wings , completely disoriented . Pain radiated from her right hip and hands . She gasped . Feet rushed toward her . " Julia ! " Her mother was at her side , propping her up . " Who left this stool here ? Everyone was told to keep the area clear . Get it out of here ! Julia ! Are you all right ? " Her mother helped her to her feet . Fear shot through her . She was shocked not only by the fall , but by the disappearance of her " facial sense . " Most of the time , it was almost as if her face could " see " a low-hanging branch ahead , or an overstuffed chair , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When your life was lightless , you quickly lost your sense of left and right , front and back . You dwelled in a sea of black . Once you were off-balance , directions turned inside out in the darkness , and your head rattled with chaos . Heightened senses vanished . Deciding where to move next became impossible . She had to pull herself together . Heart hammering , she froze and took stock . Her wrists ached . She must 've landed on her hands a lot harder than she 'd realized . More fear shook her . Her hands . She could n't injure her fingers , hands , or wrists . That 'd be the end of her playing . Instantly she felt them . " You 're hurt ! " Her mother 's whisper was a shout in her ear . There was no sharp pain . " Nothing 's broken . " She relaxed with relief . Loudly she said to the stagehands and concert staff , whom she knew from their low , concerned voices had crowded around , " I 'm fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her palms were sore . They felt bruised . But she was determined to play now , no matter what . Frantically she tried to recall her schedule for the next few days . " What 's on for tomorrow ? " she whispered . " We 're flying to Vienna . No concert for two days . Why ? It 's your hands , is n't it ? How badly are you hurt , Julia ? " Her mother 's voice was tight with worry . " The palms are a little tender . " She was lucky this time . " After I play tonight , I 'll rest a few days . " " Should n't you see a doctor right away ? Get X-rays ? " " This is like the other times , Mom . Do you have some aspirin in your shoulder bag ? " That was for the inflammation and swelling . As her mother left , Julia analyzed the shocked hush around her . No one 's facial sense was perfect , she told herself , although hers nearly always was . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the beginning of her blindness she 'd constantly walked into walls , doorjambs , and street signs . What the sighted took for granted could still be catastrophic for her . She could stumble into an open manhole and break her neck . She could step off a balcony and plunge eighty stories . The peril went with being blind , that and the bruises to body and ego . But with her there was a greater terror . She tried to push the fear away , but it was like a huge shadow dug into her shoulders , looming , ready to overwhelm her with the horror of never being able to make music again . Sweat trickled down her face . Her breath came in frightened pants . Around her silence waited , worried , embarrassed . She must n't let the fear stop her , or be intimidated by the scent of vicarious humiliation that floated thick around her from those she could n't see . Someone had inadvertently left a stool in her path . Nothing more . " Can you play ? " Her booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anxious . " I do n't think she should . " Her mother had returned . She pressed two aspirin tablets into Julia 's hand , and then a glass of water into the other . " Of course I can play , " she insisted . She took the aspirin and drank the water . " Julia ! " " Really , I 'm fine . " She could n't disappoint her audience . " How are your hands now ? " her mother demanded . " A little sore . " Julia gave a wry smile . " But I think we wo n't have to amputate . " The low murmurs around her suddenly stopped , shocked . And then the crowd chuckled with relief . Marsha Barr laughed and patted Julia 's arm . " Well , it seems things are getting back to normal . " She stepped away . " I 'm going to tell the audience there 's been a fifteen-minute delay . " As she left , Julia 's mother said , " Yes , amputation 's a bit extreme . Imagine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small laugh , but beneath the light tone Julia heard her mother 's agony of apprehension . Besides having facial sense , Julia could usually hear and feel movement . It was all due to proprioceptors  --  tiny sensory organs found in everyone 's muscles , tendons , and other subcutaneous tissues , but largely ignored by the sighted . Over the years she 'd taught herself to feel air adjust when an object moved . To hear minute sounds of impact on a carpet or a body joint creak or a stomach roll . To feel warmth as something living approached . Tonight her facial sense had been obscured long enough for her to crash into the stool . It gave her pause . And it frightened her that she could lose all her heightened senses just as she 'd lost her sight  - -  She calmed herself and concentrated . With a sudden familiarity , she felt the air shift in front of her . Her heartbeat escalated with excitement as a mysterious force she 'd never understood seemed to emerge from an enlargement of all her pores . With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With an internal explosion of joy , she held them out . Marguerite 's voice was indignant , but also relieved . " Julia ! Every time you anticipate me like that , you spook me ! " Julia smiled . " Just my proprioceptors . " Then she waited nervously as her mother took her hands and probed the fingers , palms , and wrists . Marguerite said , " I think there 's nothing serious , but I 'd still like you to see a doctor . " In other words , her mother had confirmed her own conclusion . Now Julia wanted to retreat into herself , prepare again to play . Grow calm , distant , self-absorbed . She said lightly , " Nothing 's broken , Doctor Mom . You 've diagnosed that yourself . In the morning , if they 're no better , you can call in one of your colleagues . " " You 're all heart . " " I try to cooperate . " With another surge of happiness , Julia presented her cheek . " Dammit , Julia ! Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to kiss her . Julia 's facial sense had told her that . " I love you , Mom . " She chuckled . " I know , dear . " Her mother sighed and kissed her tenderly on the presented cheek . " I love you , too . " " I 'm ready to play . Take me back to where we started so I can count my steps and do it again . " " You 're sure ? " " Is the stool gone ? " Julia asked . " Yes . " " Then I 'm sure . Absolutely . Full speed ahead . " Julia walked confidently through the solid darkness . Her long Versace gown rustled against her legs . Once more Liszt 's tudes filled her with their great beauty . She seemed to reverberate with the music , her heartbeat almost pacing itself to the rhythms . Automatically her other senses again went dormant . As she stepped onto the stage , as if at a great distance she felt the sudden heat of lights and an ocean of people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage her Steinway grand piano waited only ten steps away . She had it shipped to every concert . On arrival it was placed in the center of the stage , voiced , and regulated to her specifications . She 'd rehearsed on it that afternoon and found it tuned , agile , and graced with its usual sonorous sound . A joy to play . Eight steps . Tonight she 'd give her listeners something very European  --  the Liszt Transcendental tudes . Each &$233; tude was different technically and stylistically , and together the twelve were a monument to Romanticism . The opening &$233; tude , " Preludio , " resonated through her , challenging her to begin the extraordinary cycle . Six steps . She 'd been blind ten years now , her entire professional life since her debut as an eighteen-year-old at Carnegie . It startled her to realize how quickly the years had passed . Her world was n't forbidding and hopeless ; it glittered as it had before , but now with odors , shapes , tastes , textures , and  --  most especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prickled with tension , and her heart pounded . Two steps . She was almost there . She knew the piano was beside her . One step . She breathed deeply . She was the music , and only it mattered . Then in her stark blackness she saw a sliver of light . The shock of it was like a lightning bolt . She almost stumbled . Light ? Again ? Two nights ago in Warsaw brief light had appeared just as she was about to play . But that light had been like a thought , coming and going almost too quickly to notice , and afterwards she 'd doubted she 'd really seen it . This light lingered . Her eyes felt warm . Could she believe it ? An ache caught in the back of her throat as she fervently hoped . Yes , it was true . She blinked rapidly . The cold , black cave in which she 'd lived so long was dissolving around her . Her heart pounded with excitement . The light was beautiful . It glowed and was as pale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . As the light grew , her eyes seemed to pulse with life . The world took on a luminous sheen . Objects found their forms . Her eyes felt buoyant , and  - -  She could see ! With a clarity that made her heart soar , she instantly looked down at her Steinway . Its beauty was mesmerizing  --  the exotic pattern of the black-and-white keys , the harp-shaped top open like a treasure trunk . As the audience waited , hushed with expectations , she slid down onto the seat and ran her fingers over the seductive keyboard . She 'd waited a long time for this . Forever . Happy beyond comprehension , she drank in the sight of the complex , handsome instrument that had become her life . A long beat passed . She knew she must start to play , but  - -  She was starving to see more . She looked across to the wings . The technicians were watching curiously , unsure about her delay . She was awed by their sizes , shapes , and expressions . As if it were a great feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which memory told her was simply institutional green . But in that moment on that dark , neutral stage , the dull green seemed the brightest , most appealing color she 'd ever seen . She could see . But was it real ? Could she trust herself ? She turned to the audience , to this creature she both loved and feared . She caught glints of diamonds and gold , the rich textures of silk and satin , the smooth-shaved men in their evening clothes , and the expensively made-up women with their manicured hair . Shyly she relished their rapt expressions . They were here to listen to her performance . The audience was stirring , restless and impatient . She was taking too long . She felt a delicious laugh rise in her throat . Of course , they thought she was still blind . They could n't know  - -  She hungered to go on looking , looking ... proving to herself her sight was back ... reveling over and over again in the most minute details of this glorious world that had seemed forever lost  - -  But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd missed , she told herself . Her sight was back . There was an amphitheater full of people out there , waiting . Elated , she lifted her hands and paused just long enough to feel all her euphoria for this supreme moment . Then she began to play , and life poured out . Both triumph and joy fueled Julia Austrian that night . Her jubilation at regaining her sight gave her power , and the power flowed like a wide , deep river into Liszt 's tudes . For her , making music was many things , but tonight it was also a way to reaffirm her dreams . Her fingers were jackhammers on the keys , and they were butterfly wings . She made the notes dance and soar and shout and weep and laugh . They pirouetted and glided . And then in the fourth tude  --  " Mazeppa "  --  where the music portrayed a Cossack tied to a wild stallion , where the finger work was exhausting because Liszt 's demanding notes gave a monumental workout to arms and wrists , she forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and loneliness . Sweating , intense , she escaped into that sublime netherworld where she and the music were indistinguishable . She was all of its compelling emotions , all of its grand poetry , all of its myths . Whether the concert was good or bad no longer mattered . Her playing took on a life of its own . The muscles she 'd worked so religiously to build , the stamina that was her hard-won trophy for years of exercise and weight lifting , gave her the elastic strength to perform on the level of the greatest maestros . As she approached the final study , no. 12  --  " Snowscape "  --  she was aware in some distant recess she was giving a breathtaking performance . But what consumed her was the delicacy , the sensitivity with which she must play now so she could balance the melody and tremolando accompaniment . She poured her heart into Liszt 's greatest &$233; tude , into its wrenching desolation . She could see the snowflakes drifting down everywhere , shrouding the world in white , entombing humans and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind sighed and moaned . As she struck the final notes , the music lingered almost palpable in the air . Haunting . There was a hushed pause . Then utter silence . The audience leaped to its feet in ovation . They clapped . They called . They shouted . The noise went on and on . She bowed , left , played an encore , returned , bowed , played another encore . Again and again . And finally stood there on the stage , humbled , head lowered before such thunderous approval , almost forgetting she was no longer blind .
