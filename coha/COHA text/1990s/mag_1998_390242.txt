Section : SCIENCE &; TECHNOLOGY Christmas Goes Online Forget about the traffic , the crowds , the ugly battles for sold-out toys . This season millions are giddily cybershopping their way through the holidays . <p> LAST CHRISTMAS SEASON , Michelle Speetzen 's life was like yours : Mall Hell . Enduring hourlong gridlock on the road from suburban Spring , Texas , to Houston 's Willowbrook Mall , the 36-year-old working mom would whiff on her wish list and get back in the car to fight traffic headed for other packed stores . The craziest moment came when she triumphantly snagged a coveted Sleep-N-Snore Ernie  --  the key to her 5-year-old son 's happiness  --  and barely escaped a mob of similarly desperate parents who 'd picked up the scent of fake fur . <p> But this year , Speetzen has it wired . After young Dylan 's bedtime , she steals to the spare bedroom upstairs , her face illuminated by the hearthlike glow of her Compaq Presario . And mouseclick by mouseclick , her shopping list shrinks . Books . Antiques . Beanie Baby rarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad Ali boxing glove . Her crowning achievement came last Friday after she painfully realized that Dylan had his fickle little heart set on this year 's **31;660;TOOLONG toy , the baffling , babbling Furby . After 20 minutes of Web-browsing she located one at America Online 's shopping site . It cost more than three times the $30 list price , but , Hey , I want it under the tree for my son , ' she says . It 'll be at my door in a few days , and I do n't have to fight anybody in a store . ' <p> Michelle Speetzen represents the advance guard of an army that 's about to change not only the nature of holiday shopping , but the face of retailing itself . After years of failing to live up to vaunted promises , e-commerce  --  buying by modem  --  is finally taking off . All over America , catalogs are being supplanted by URLs , cash registers overtaken by secure transaction protocols and merry ho-ho-ho 's replaced by error messages , as millions set out to procure presents over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is n't going to be a white Christmas , ' says Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos , e-commerce 's unofficial billionaire Santa Claus . It 's going to be a Web Christmas . ' <p> True , even in this breakthrough year , the estimated $2.3 billion Americans will spend on Web gifts is only a fraction of the Fort Knoxish total holiday drop . But it 's well over double last year 's total , and many people expect a threefold increase in Christmas e-sales . You can view this year-end boom as the culmination of a lucrative trend . According to Jupiter Communications , almost 17 million people will buy something from a Web site this year , up from 10 million last year and 5 million in 1996 . Within a decade , the Jupiter people believe , the mouseclickers will eclipse the catalog buyers . It 's not just hype , ' says Richard Donaldson of L.L. Bean , gushing that the Maine retailer 's online holiday sales have tripled those of 1997 's  --  and that 's just from purchases made before Thanksgiving . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any Internet company that takes credit cards . It 's also the motivating belief in a speech Bill Clinton plans to make this week , predicting that electronic commerce will grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by 2002 . And America Online honcho Steve Case has readily admitted that the major impetus for his own big holiday purchase , Netscape Communications Corp. , was the potential to increase AOL 's e-commerce muscle . Case 's dream is to dominate the digital marketplace , keeping Microsoft 's nose pressed against the window . <p> That 's for the future , when presumably we 'll do our shopping not only by computer but by pushing buttons on our palmtops , phones and refrigerator doors . This season we can ponder the breakthrough itself , as revealed by a Visa survey taken in November : 46 percent of those polled plan to buy at least some gifts online . And 60 percent of e-shoppers report doing so in their pajamas . <p> How did electronic shopping turn the corner ? There 's really been no significant technological breakthroughs in the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference is a confidence level of consumers that leads them to hit the buy it ' button . ' Mallett notes that this year is the first time that more than half of the Web population has been online for over a year , and that experience breeds a comfort level that encourages the once daring leap of a purchase in electronic ether . <p> Because the online brands are familiar to customers , they also have fewer worries about darkside hackers ' swiping their credit-card numbers , or unscrupulous merchants ' not shipping the goods . Shopping on AOL is like living in a gated community , ' says America Online VP Wendy Brown . It 's extremely safe and secure . ' ( In any event , federal law limits credit-card liability to $50 , in the extremely unlikely case that some packet sniffer swipes your number . ) <p> The Web sites are better , too . The first consumer Web sites were more like print advertising , ' says Microsoft VP Rich Tong . Now they use interactivity and personalization to show more of their wares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Most important , the new generation of shop sites are so easy to use that consumers like Speetzen do n't have to give the medium a second thought . I 'm not a nerd , ' she says , but I know how to shop . ' <p> Retailing experts have been startled at some of the early behavior of online buyers . While many thought that commodity items like books and computers would forever rule in the virtual shopping baskets , last year apparel was AOL 's most popular category . And while technophile males are still heavily overrepresented in cyberspace at large , many aisles of e-commerce reflect a near-perfect gender balance . <p> The willingness of consumers to take the purchasing plunge has only intensified an existing panic in the traditional retailing community . The first big players in e-sales have been Internet-savvy outsiders instead of the Macy 's and the Bloomingdale 's , which wasted time fretting whether an online venture would cannibalize their sales . And in cyberspace at least , the nerds have been killing the category killers . The archetype , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's biggest bookstore . ' It 's certainly the richest  --  only three years old and yet to log a profit , Amazon 's market value is now more than $11 billion . That 's four times that of Barnes &; Noble , a giant encumbered by its peculiar insistence on actually accommodating real people who walk in , touch the merchandise and carry their wares to cashiers . A merger of the two online giants of music , CDnow and N2K , has rattled the likes of Tower Records . And the Geppettos at Toys R ' Us are undoubtedly having night sweats at the prospect that eToys actually may be Us . <p> Now everyone from Nordstrom to the Gap has started big-time Web operations , hoping to keep up with the Amazons . If you miss this Christmas season , ' says David Pecaut of the Boston Consulting Group , you are one more year behind when next Christmas comes . ' In other words , no matter how many sales per square foot a retailer logs in the real world , a failure to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of being Woolworthed . I think that not selling online leaves you completely at risk , ' says Macys.com president Kent Anderson . <p> Judging from the nimble responses of , say , Amazon.com itself , it wo n't be easy . The virtual bookseller has already added a 60,000-title video store , and this season unveiled a gift section with toys , games , puzzles and Sony Discmans . Batteries come included with everything , and the unseen support staff  --  elves , maybe ?  --  will wrap and ship the goodies . The goal is , no matter who you have in mind , we have the right gift for that person , ' says Bezos . <p> Further competition for traditional stores comes from the hottest new category in Web shopping : auction houses . They offer either the opportunity to snatch up goods below retail , or , in the case of the Internet 's sweetest winner of late , eBay , a shot at about a million different items for bid , ranging from obscure sports memorabilia ( a 1958 Philadelphia Phillies ticket stub ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most successful Web sites offer you a speedy means to get to the merchandise and a personalization factor that makes use of the Net 's interactivity . The Lands ' End site offers a kind of virtual shopping assistant  --  go to Oxford Express and you 're asked your shirt size , color and styling preferences , sorting through a massive selection of dress shirts to match your needs . It 's like having a digital tailor without the occasional embarrassment that comes from telling others your measurements , ' says Lands ' End exec Willie Doyle . <p> Savings are also important , especially since the Web encourages quick comparisons . Internet word-of-mouth has lately favored Bluefly.com , a digital equivalent of designer-outlet shops . Finding this was the end of my online virginity , ' says adman Jerry Della Femina . They 'll have a Ralph Lauren shirt and it 'll say 50 percent off and all of a sudden you 're caught up in it . ' <p> What does this mean for small local merchants , already under pressure from big retailers and catalog shopping ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will extend their local business worldwide . Jeremiah 's Pick Coffee Co. , an eight-employee shop in San Francisco , started selling online last March ; in all of October its e-sales totaled five bags of coffee . ( The cost of selling online can be as low as a few thousand dollars for a bare-bones operation , up to millions for a sophisticated site . ) <p> But some other small operations have found success by partnering with shopping supersites like AOL , Yahoo or Microsoft . Start-ups like Fridge.com , which sells refrigerator magnets ( want Hogan 's Heroes on your Hotpoint ? ) , draws visitors by affiliating with Yahoo and getting access to its 40 million users . You either partner with a high-traffic site , ' says founder Chris Gwyn , or your site 's going to be a hobby . ' <p> But while online shopping offers convenience , savings and a foolproof means to avoid holiday elevator music , it has its drawbacks , too . Despite its rapid evolution , e-shopping is very much a work in progress , and even its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maddening waits . If you know what you want , electronic shopping is almost always faster than schlepping off to the store . If you do n't , be prepared for incredibly tedious delays as you browse . While you can flip through a paper catalog in seconds , you 'll feel your gums receding in the time it takes to load a few pages of fashion choices on a Web site at dial-up speeds . <p> Limited payment options . If a site does n't take credit cards , you 're back in Snail Mail Country , moving from the speed of light to pony express . This is a particularly tough problem when you 're trying to nail down a unique item at an auction site like eBay . Even if you 're lucky enough to hold the high bid when the virtual gavel falls , you must make your purchase offline , either paying by check or money order ( requiring a visit to the bank , located in the smelly old real world ) . eBay VP Steve Wesley says that by next year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by credit card , but cynics will note that pundits previously predicted the advent of electronic Internet cash  --  by 1997 . <p> Customer-service gaps . On one hand , says dedicated e-shopper Suzanne Moilanen of Beaumont , Texas , no one 's rude to you online . ' On the other hand , at many sites , no one 's online . Getting a question answered is a hit-and-miss operation that will be especially dicey during the busy holiday season . What do you do when you 've spent an hour loading your virtual shopping cart with carefully selected items , painstakingly filled out the sales forms and then , just as you 're ready to hit the order ' button , the system freezes ? You can scream , but in cyberspace no one will hear you . <p> Fraud . Poor Christine Plathy . Earlier this year the Ohio accountant saw the Beanie Baby of her dreams on eBay : a rare Wingless Quacker . The manufacturer had made only a few hundred of these ducks without wings , and Plathy was glad to buy it for $1,800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says Plathy . They 'd bought one of the current Quackers for $5 and chopped his wings off . ' Later , Plathy discovered that two dozen others had been ripped off by the seller ( who has since been suspended from eBay ) . In his speech this week , Clinton will direct the Commerce Department and the FTC to step upcyberfraud enforcement . <p> Privacy concerns . There 's an elaborate electronic record kept of your likes and dislikes , ' says Forrester Research analyst Maria LaTour Kadison . The information helps Web retailers mimic the intimacy some consumers have with local stores . ' Unfortunately , consumers are rarely asked if they 'd like those intimate relationships . ( In their defense , e-shops generally hit customers with sharply targeted e-mail , as opposed to onerous carpet-bomb spam . ' ' ) <p> Furby abuse . Modem warriors never have to get into 6 a.m. hair-pulling fights outside Wal-Mart to get one of those gregarious fur balls . But online they have other problems , like trying to win Furby auctions on eBay or Yahoo ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually for $60 to $100 or more ) . Or they can dump out their wallets at places like Egift , which currently offers a 25 percent discount from its normal Furby price of $124 . Interesting discount for an item that lists for $30 . <p> The obvious lessons ? Do your browsing at work , or wherever you have high-speed access to the Net . If you 're in a hurry , stick to familiar supersites , where you can quickly get to popular items . Make sure that sellers offer you refunds . If you want to try an unfamiliar site , start with a small purchase to test the waters . And start early : overnight delivery ' is often the online equivalent of the check 's in the mail . ' <p> But dwelling on the flaws of e-Christmas is kind of a Grinch-like response to what , for many people , has already become a panacea for the least wonderful time of year . While the weather outside is frightful , you can visit thousands of virtual stores with millions of great items  --  while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett .
