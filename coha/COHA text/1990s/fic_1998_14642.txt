Scene : We see MARSHA , alone . Except for the table and the sandalwood box itself , all scenic devising is done vocally . MARSHA GATES My name is Marsha Gates . I lost my voice on the 9th of November , 1993 as a result of an act of the Unseen . If you think you can not be so stricken , dream on . CHORUS I took the IRT every other day for speech therapy . In a remote part of Brooklyn . Avenue X. Where my therapist , an angelic person , resides . Her name is Gladys Stone . Doctor Gladys Stone . ( The good DOCTOR appears . MARSHA tries to speak . ) ? ( ! ) ( DOCTOR STONE tries to speak . ) ! ( ? ) ( Since neither can speak both give it up . Pause . ) CHORUS Dream on I did , but ( The good DOCTOR disappears . ) MARSHA GATES Parallel lines meet in Brooklyn . The East and Westside IRT . This geometry is also of the Unseen . It is inhuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mystery* is subject to error . CHORUS It is human to be so stricken ; MARSHA GATES I took the wrong train . ( We 're on the wrong train. ) p. 3 MARSHA GATES I took the wrong train and arrived at a strange place . A place I did not know . The air felt humid and tropical . The air felt not of the city I knew . A lush , golden vegetation soared up , up and all around the familiar landscape of the city , like a fantastic aviary . It was an fantastic aviary . A place full of exotic specimens . ( Pause . ) It occurred to me I might have lost my mind as well , although I did not think so because the idea gave me such strange pleasure , like the touch of a feather along the top of my hand . This place seemed a paradise . I laughed and fell asleep . I dreamed CHORUS I am waiting at a bus stop , waiting to return to my home . Another person is standing there with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aviary . ) PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL Hiya . MARSHA GATES Hello . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I 'm Professor Claudia Mitchell . MARSHA GATES I 'm Marsha Gates , a part-time student . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I 'm an archeologist , of sorts . MARSHA GATES I 'm a student at City College . No declared major . I also work part time in a theater . Great Wind Repertory . The plays are all shit . TV with dirty words . p. 4 PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I see . MARSHA GATES I ca n't speak either . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL So I understand . MARSHA GATES It 's very aggravating . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL So it would seem . ( Pause . ) My specialty is human catastrophe . MARSHA GATES That 's very nice , but you 're making me nervous . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL So it would seem . MARSHA GATES Is this the Zoological Gardens ? The beasts seem to be making a considerable noise . Perhaps the person who is supposed to feed them CHORUS has been stricken , * like you , by an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MITCHELL I see . Perhaps so . Perhaps , however , you mean an act of complete probabalistic caprice . A fly in the Unseen 's ointment . An ontological whigmaleery . A whim of the die . MARSHA GATES I work in the theater . Philosophy makes me nervous . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I see . What theater ? p. 5 MARSHA GATES I am a prop girl at Great Wind Rep. I told you . ( The PROFESSOR throws back her head and laughs . Pause . ) PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL An artist ! Then surely you must appreciate the higher things in life . Knowledge . Ideas pertaining to a theory of the world Id . The power of the mind to crank out ideational constructs beyond mere calculation and desire not to mentionmere mortality . MARSHA GATES This bus sure is taking a long time . CHORUS The bus arrives in a wild rotation of dust , hot fumes , and the clangor of the unmuffled internal combustion engine . ( All are deafened . ) An instrument of noise close to the heart of disaster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bus . Do n't just stand there quaking . We in the bus business do n't have all day . We live complex lives . We dream , gamble , seek , deserve a better fate than Time or Destiny , through the agency of the Unseen , allows . So , get aboard if you are going to . If you dare . There , there in the valley , someone is playing a saxophone among the peonies . His heart is broke . There 's no poop in his pizzle and surely the will of the Unseen shall bear witness , and lift him up from the abyss of his of his wretchedness , to the bright aire above where lizards , snakes and the mythic tortoise areglub , glubMy basket of sandwiches flew off into the cheese that is the north end of the thing in the hot ladder . Groans and slavver . Spit and questions marked on the margin . A sale of snaps , larval coruscations . Sweet drug of oblivion . On a global scale . Flowers of unknown radiance , snarls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the man who discovers himself stubbed , in an ashtray . Put out . All the work of the Unseen , like a wind in the sail of our hour , midnight , when we encounter the Adversary , anarchic and covered with hairs , in the form of our good neighbor 's discarded sofa , left out for the garbage man to pick up . He would like to discover the truth about what can do no harm only if it is kept , safely under lock and key , in its cage , with no poop in its pizzle , aware of us but dimly ; us lost in the crunching despair of our endless opening up before the doings of the Unseen , in all our sick , sad , pathetic innocence . Innocence that is only the half-cracked euphemism for our woe , which possesses not even the required token for the train , or bus . Nor even the train to the plane . Not even the faith to enact that pizzle. p. 6 MARSHA GATES I do n't have a token. * Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have a token . Do you have a token ? ( They look at each other hopelessly . Pause . ) BUS DRIVER Then what are you wasting my time for ? PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL And he drove off , leaving us both in a brown study , abandoned . So I turned to my young companion , green with anxiety , and spoke in what I imagined were soothing tones ( Long pause . ) PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I collect catastrophes . Vitrified catastrophes.Enchanted in a case of glass . Encased in glass , * that is . MARSHA GATES What a mess. * Farblonjet . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL You like messes ? * Aha . MARSHA GATES What a disaster . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL So you are fond of* disaster ! MARSHA GATES What a catastrophe ! PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL Quelle catastrophe ! I collect them , you know . p. 7 MARSHA GATES What did you say ? PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I collect catastrophes. * Vitrified , of course . MARSHA GATES No , the other thing you said . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL Vitrified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to see my collection ? My estate is very close , just beyond the lianas . MARSHA GATES No , no . The other thing you said . PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL Never mind . Never mind . That was in the French language . The language of love . ( They exchange long , hard looks . ) CHORUS So I went to her house . In the deep Forest , near Avenue X. I went with her , although I knew there was something about it not quite right . ( Pause . ) Something , in fact , quite wicked . MARSHA GATES I suspected that my hostess , Doctor Claudia Mitchell , harbored heretical views on the topic of the Unseen . CHORUS heh-heh ( Pause. ) heh-heh ( MARSHA looks hard at the PROFESSOR . ) MARSHA GATES I could not bring myself to ask . Her draperies were of the finest brocade , purple and stiff , annihilating the out of doors with its pedestrian bird cries , bus fumes , the horror of the city'shullabaloo p. 8 CHORUS Tick-tocktick-tock ( Repeat ) PROFESSOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young girl , and myself , and led her into my studio . MARSHA GATES There , upon a long , dark-grained , baroque table of immense , carved teak , supported by four grotesque , dragon-faced whorls of some other strange wood , layta-da ! PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL My sandalwood box . Within it , my dear Marsha , is nestled my collection . MARSHA GATES The deep plush of the box 's dark interior took my breath away . ( The CHORUS joins MARSHA and the PROFESSOR around the sandalwood box . ) PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL This is ( She holds up a small , bright object . ) Seoul , Korea . December 25th , 1971 . The worst hotel fire in history. * An eight-hour blaze at the 222 room Taeyokale Hotel . A total of 163 persons are incinerated or succumb to the horrors of noxious inhalation . Two workmen are later sent to prison for terms of three to five years , convicted of carelessness in the handling of gasoline . ( Pause . She replaces it in its place and holds up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1014 A.D. Danish raiders under chieftain Sweyn the First ( Forkbeard ) are repelled by the forces of King Brian Boru . The Danes are mauled , with a loss of 6000 , and driven back to their stumpy ships . Both Boru and his son are killed . Forkbeard is slain later that year . ( And another . ) Saint Gotthard Pass , Italian Alps . 1478 . During the private war between the Duke of Milan and another feudal lord , an array of 60 stout Zurichers , allies of the Milanese are flattened by an avalanche in the early afternoon , with the solar furnace blazing away so innocently above . ( And another . ) Kossovo , in southern Yugoslavia . 1389 . Prince Lazar 's Serbian army of 25,000 meets the Spahis and Janazaries of Sultan Murad in the morning mists of the 20th of June . In accordance with a prophecy of the Unseen , the entire Serbian force is annihilated , thus clearing the way for Turkish mastery of the region for over half a millennium . ( And another . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water 30 to 40 feet high bursts down upon the town as the entire dam collapses . Over two thousand people are drowned , or dragged to their deaths over tree branches , barbed wires and overturned houses . Victims continue to be unearthed , some far upstream , for the next seventeen years . ( Yet another . ) The retreat of the French Army from Moscow , begun on October 19th , 1812 . Hounded cruelly by marauding Russian guerrillas , the Grande Arme is soon mangled and beaten  --  reduced to a desperate , starving horde . Snows begin to fall on November 4 . Ten days later Napoleon is left with only 25,000 able-bodied fighters . At the River Berezina 10,000 stragglers are abandoned in the crossing on the 29th . French losses are the worst in history : 400,000 men , 175,000 horses , 1,000 cannon . ( Pause . ) This wonderful collection constitutes only the merest part of the world 's catastrophe , which in toto comprises the dark side of the Unseen 's Id . p. 9 MARSHA GATES But I hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stole into my mind , and I began to wonder , out loud : MARSHA GATES Why is the night better than the day ? Why do the young become old , and not the other way around ? Why is the world made mostly of clay ? Why ca n't a person always tell what is wrong from what is right ? Why does the full weight of the Unseen fall most heavily upon the visible , like brass ? Why ca n't we see what it is that compels both cause and effect to be so interfixed ? Why ca n't I find a number beyond which nothing can be enumerated ? Why ca n't I know what will come of what I do , think , and say ? Why ca n't I know truth from lies the way I do up from down . Why is one person 's disaster not catastrophe for all ? And who knows why these things are called unaccounted . Unaccountable . Uncountable . And why , oh why , do n't we know who does know the answers to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we possess and are possessed by a question , the answer must , too , be hidden somewhere , somewhere in the heart of someone , someone real , and not a phantom of the Unseen ? CHORUS Dream on , they did . Dream on MARSHA GATES When , however , I perceived , at last , the true sickness of her Idher sick , squat , demented IdI stepped quietly behind her while she was focused on her precious set of vitrified catastrophesand picked up a large , blunt object to bludgeon her with , but ( Picks up a chair , freezes . The PROFESSOR turns to her , freezes . Pause . They look at each other a long time. ) p. 10 MARSHA GATES When I saw she wanted me to do itShe wanted me to do itout of a curious **27;3286;TOOLONG ( Slowly MARSHA lowers the chair . ) PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL I am a recovering alcoholic , and a fraud . MARSHA GATES And I knew she was neitherso : CHORUS Out of a curious , covetous , vexatious perversity MARSHA GATES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refuse* to do it CHORUS I REFUSE TO BLUDGEON* HER . MARSHA GATES Simply put : I refused to do* it . CHORUS She refused . ( She laughs . The PROFESSOR roars out a command . ) PROFESSOR CLAUDIA MITCHELL OSVALDO ! OSVALDO ! Throbow hobero obobut . ( The CHORUS beats her up , and throws her out . As this is being done we hear the following , sung . ) PROFESSOR AND MARSHA 'S VOICE-OVER In the name of Idand all the Id 's workshow me what dark worksare done in the dark . In the name of disaster.In the name of catastrophe . ( Pause . She lies outside the door of the PROFESSOR 'S hosue , dazed . We hear birds cry. ) p. 11 MARSHA GATES Her man , an ape named Osvaldo , beat me and threw me out , but ( Pause . She opens her hand , revealing one small , glimmering object . ) CHORUS As I lay , bloody and beaten , on the forest floor , amongst dead leaves and whatnot , nearly poisoned by lethal inhalation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had stolen one small , nearly perfect catastrophe : ( A slow blackout begins . ) MARSHA GATES April 4 , 1933 . The United States dirigible Akron goes down in heavy seas , in a remote spot in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a loss of 73 nearly perfect lives . ( Pause. )
