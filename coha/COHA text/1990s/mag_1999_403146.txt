With inflation tame , interest rates down and corporate earnings up , the Dow is heading to 10,000 and beyond . // YOU WO N'T FIND this market in the textbooks . Many time-honored indicators say stocks should have stalled long ago . Yet here we are , heading toward a fourth straight year of 2o%-plus gains-a run unmatched for decades . And the market shows no sign of running out of steam anytime soon . U No , I 'm not proclaiming a New Era for stocks , where the old rules simply do n't apply and growth is endless . Instead , I see the current stock market as what statisticians call an outlier-an exceptional case that does n't fit with normal patterns . Precisely because the current market is n't behaving normally , you ca n't rely on historical benchmarks to guide you . For example , there 's no question that most popular stocks are overpriced by every standard measure-yet that does n't mean they wo n't climb still higher . Even as they speed by those traditional stop signs , however , share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the trends in inflation and interest rates and the outlook for economic growth . And while it would certainly be foolish to ignore the risks of today 's stock market , where many shares are overpriced and volatility is increasing ( up more than so% since 1994 ) , a careful analysis of this spectacular bull market suggests that the Dow could gain another 10% in 1999 and continue climbing for another two or three years . In this article , I 'll go step by step through the forces propelling stocks upward . THE GOOD TIMES ARE N'T OVER YET BEFORE YOU CAN decide whether the current bull market is over , you have to figure out which bull market you 're talking about . Generally , people focus on the boom that began after the 1990-91 recession . This powerful uptrend has continued for more than eight years , with a slight correction in 1994 ( down 9.7% ) and a more severe correction this past summer ( down almost 20% ) . However , to understand why stocks are so astonishingly resilient today , it 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended bull market . // THE BULL MARKET // Here 's why . The past 50 years of stock market history break clearly into three periods , each lasting a little over 16 years and characterized by a distinct inflation trend . From 1949 to 1966 , inflation was low and the Dow rose sixfold . From 1966 to 1982 , inflation soared and stock prices did n't move up at all . And from 1982 to date , inflation has dropped again , fueling a tenfold gain in share prices . As long as inflation is tame , you can be fairly sure the major bull market has n't ended and any corrections will likely be short-lived . The other important force propelling stock prices is corporate profit growth . And since 1982 , the average profits of the Dow stocks have more than tripled , thanks mainly to a robust economy and relentless cost cutting . With inflation down to a minimal 1.5% and earnings headed up , albeit more slowly than in the early ' 90s , stocks look likely to continue rising . Of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on two other factors as well-changes in Federal Reserve policy and current stock valuations ( shares that are overpriced enough can go down even in good times , while cheap stocks can rise in mediocre markets ) . SHORT-TSRM RATES HAVE ROOM TO FALL IF THERE 'S ANY nearly foolproof rule of investing , it 's this : Do n't fight the Fed . Chairman Alan Greenspan has cut rates three times from late September to midNovember . Similar periods of Fed easing have occurred 19 times in this century ; on average the market has gained 28% within a year of those rate cuts . That includes times when stock prices were high to begin with ( even if not quite as lofty as they are today ) . Whatever P/Es stocks sport today , the key to their moving higher is a continuation of favorable interest rates . As I explained in my analysis of Fed policy in the December issue of MONEY , Greenspan 's actions reflect a consistent strategy . He believes in stomping inflation when the economy is strong enough to take it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually high ( see the chart below , left ) . But when he sees a slowdown brewing , Greenspan starts lowering rates-fairly quickly , if necessary That 's why he cut rates this fall and why he may keep trimming them over the next 12 months . // ... BECAUSE EARNINGS HAVE RISEN AND INTEREST RATES HAVE DROPPED . // BOND YIELDS ARE PAST THEIR LOWS BY CONTRAST , BOND yields have probably gone about as low as they 're going The drop in 30-year Treasury yields to 4.7% on Oct. 5 was the result of a rush to quality . After Long-Term Capital Management and other hedge funds were hit with enormous losses , professional investors ran like scalded dogs for safe havens . Those buyers bid up bond prices , pushing yields unusually low . Under more normal circumstances , long-term bond yields are set by investors ' inflation expectations and desire for a real return . Unlike short-term rates , however , long-term-bond yields reflect investors ' experience of inflation over longer stretches of time than a single quarter . In the chart at right , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that runs from two to 3 percentage points above the average inflation rate of the previous four years . As you can see , 30-year Treasury bond yields have stayed within this band for most of the past eight years and are currently right in the middle of the range . LOW RATES SHOULD PREVENT A SLUMP IN A WAY , THE prospect of lower shortterm rates and stable long-term rates is the best news stock investors could get . When short-term rates are high relative to long-term rates , you have what economists call a flat yield curve . That 's typically a sign that the economy is slowing . But when short rates fall relative to long rates , you get an upward-sloping yield curve that usually signals a pickup in growth . Since the U.S. economy was already losing momentum before Greenspan cut rates , a mild upward tilt to the yield curve wo n't produce a boom . It should , however , support the economy enough to prevent a serious recession . We may well get a mild slump sometime later this year . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months-without the market taking much of a hit . PROFIT GROWTH WILL SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH , running above 3.5% in ' 98 , is likely to slow to 2.5% or less in ' 99 . In that sluggish environment , earnings for the S &P; 500 will be hardpressed to grow more than 6% . That 's way below the double-digit earnings gains the S &P; 500 posted in the early ' 90s . So you 'll have to look for exceptional stocks to beat the market in 1999 . They could be tech companies that are growing much faster than the overall economy ; they could be firms that are restructuring to wring more profits out of their existing revenues ; or they could be prime beneficiaries of current business conditions . But they 've got to have something extra . ( See page 86 for our discussion of investments that fit that description. ) // Treasury bill yields have room to fall . They INTEREST Ls normally run no more than 1.5 percentage points above the current inflation rate . They have been unusually high since 1994 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation . Long-term Treasury bond yields figure to be fairly stable . They have returned to the middle of their customary range , which is two to 312 points above the average inflation rate for the previous four years . // THE NOT STOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE NO MATTER HOW you analyze stocks , there 's no question that the most popular ones are expensive . And I 'm referring not only to nutty Internet issues but also to the large-caps that are the cornerstone of most investors ' portfolios-and most growth mutual funds . The chart at left , above , shows how the average price/earnings ratio of the stocks that make up the S &P; 500 has risen since the current boom began . ( To eliminate distortions , I 've plotted the so-called normalized P/E of the S &P; 500 , as calculated by the Leuthold Group . This adjusted figure eliminates shortterm earnings blips . ) Since 1979 , the average P/E of the S &P; 500 has climbed from less than 10 to 25 . Given that the historical average is 15 , the current level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , though , the market 's current P/E is n't quite as dizzying as it appears . The fair P/E for stocks increases as inflation declines . And while 10 was the fair P/E back in 1979 , when inflation was running in double digits , today 's 1.5% inflation rate justifies a P/E of 18 to 19 . That does n't make today 's 25 market multiple cheap , but it 's not as bad as it looks .  --  WHILE MANY OTHER TOOK ARE CHEAP IT 'S A MISTAKE , however , to consider only the S &P; 500 or the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average in assessing today 's stock market prices . Thousands of stocks are actually undervalued , including small-cap and midcap issues , as well as the shares of companies in depressed industries like oil and mining . If you look at the market as a bundle of different sectors , you 'll see that there are an enormous number of bargains . The chart at right , above , shows how the divergence between large and smaller stocks has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the P/Es of both big and small-to-mid-size stocks moved more or less in sync . Then , in the year and a half before the 1987 crash , bigcaps rocketed to a huge premium . The two groups came back together after the 1990-91 recession but then moved apart again during the past five years . Because the sharp market correction this past summer hit small and mid-size stocks even harder than blue chips , the gap is the biggest it 's been since before the 1987 crash . To some extent , the higher valuations for blue chips reflect the faster earnings growth that multinationals have enjoyed . But that explains only part of the gap . The rest reflects the fact that thousands of stocks have been neglected-and many of those are fairly priced or downright cheap . // STOCK VALUATIONS The average price/earnings ratio for stocks in the S &; P 500 there is some 30% higher than its fair value based on the inflation rate , as shown in the chart at left , above . But that does n't mean all stocks are overvalued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dow 30 and the typical stock , as you can see in the chart at right , above . // THE DOW FIGURES TO TOP 10,000 HERE 'S ANOTHER favorable factor for the ' 99 market : Stocks are in the midst of a powerful rebound from the recent selloff . As I noted in the November issue , the number of weekly new lows on the New York Stock Exchange ballooned this summer to more than 40% of the total number of issues traded . Historically , that 's been a virtually infallible signal of a short- to intermediate-term bottom . Such a broad sell-off has occurred in only five other periods in the past 30 years ( 1970,1974,1980,1987 and 1990 ) . Each time , the Dow rebounded for more than a year , rising more than 30% . The rebound from the October bottom was the fifth strongest in the past 59 years . And a continuation of that rally would put the Dow just over 10,000 by year-end . Of course , any number of possible but unexpected jolts-from renewed troubles in Asia to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's good reason to remain cautious . Also , given the already high level of stock prices and the likelihood of only modest earnings growth , the Dow 's current upside looks limited enough that you should n't be swinging for the fences . Still , there 's little reason to sit on the bench STICK WITH STOCKS BUT THINK DEFENSIVE IF EVENTS FOLLOW this forecast , you will get the highest return with the least risk over the coming year by sticking mostly with stocks . Also , diversify as broadly as possible , making sure to include sectors in your investing mix that have the potential to outpace the overall market in 1999 . If you 've become overweighted in bluechip stocks , consider dipping into the relatively undervalued choices among midcaps and even small-caps . And be sure to include some stocks ( or funds ) in industries that would benefit from a rise in inflation , such as energy , mining , paper or other natural resources . If you 're a typical fund investor , you can assemble a well-balanced portfolio by putting at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bond funds . The remaining 10% can go into a moneymarket fund , so that you have buying power next time the stock market corrects , as it surely will . The chart at left shows a modified fund portfolio for a 4012 ) . While not all plans will have this complete range of choices , it 's a useful benchmark ( we 'd encourage you to keep the basic balance between stocks and bonds ) . For those who buy individual issues , try to focus on stocks or other investments that have the best chance of adding incremental returns to your portfolio in 1999 For our 12 top picks , just turn the page . HOW TO INVEST YOUR 401 ( k ) THE BASIC RULE of retirement investing is to settle on an appropriate mix and stick with it . Trying to catch market swings by jumping in and out of funds in your 401(k) is 3 loser 's game . But it does make sense to shift money into depressed sectors that help you diversify . Current examples include small-caps , foreign stocks and high-yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sectors , but if you have the option , here 's the mix to aim for . // MARKET GAINS Although the Dow is n't likely to keep rising as fast as it has over the past three years , projections based on likely inflation and corporate profit growth suggest that blue chips could rise 10% or so in 1999 , taking the Dow above 10,000 . Unexpected shocks could divert the market temporarily , as happened this past summer . But barring another bout of the Asian flu or a jump in inflation , the outlook for good-quality stocks is bright . // AN IDEAL MIX Sidebar UPDATE : HOW LAST YEAR 'S FORECAST FARED Sidebar LAST YEAR , OUR most prescient prediction was that the Dow would swing wildly in 1998 . And swing it did . We thought it might fall as low as 7000 and rise as high as 8SOO . In fact , the Asian financial crisis sparked a near-20% crash last summer , sending the Dow as low as 7539 . On the upside , it rose to a record-high 9374 . Overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue chips . As of Dec. 3 , stocks were running ahead of our expectations , with the Dow up 12.3% for the year and the S &P; 500 ahead by 18:l0 to : Among our other predictions , inflation turned out to be even better behaved than we anticipated . Short-term interest rates fell as expected but came down even more than we thought likely . Similarly , bond yields fell , dropping half a percentage point more than we thought they would . // <p>
