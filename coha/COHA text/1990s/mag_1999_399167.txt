Section : Money &; Investing Real Estate Renting is just throwing money away , right ? Not so fast . Opting for a lease instead of a title right now may save you a fortune later on that dream apartment . Here 's how to figure it out . <p> RICHARD WOLLACK AND William Rothe are high-level executives at the same San Francisco commercial property brokerage . They usually agree on things at work , and they know a lot about real estate . By chance , they both were hunting for apartments in San Francisco this summer . But curiously , they ended up making very different bets on the future of their hometown 's red-hot housing market . <p> Rothe and his wife , who 'd been renting an apartment in the city 's Marina district , decided to buy a condo nearby . " We took the risk of buying in a peak market , " says Rothe , " but we wanted the tax advantages . " <p> Meanwhile , Wollack and his wife sold their 5,000-square-foot house in Presidio Heights , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has felt empty ever since their two children left for college . They moved to a three-bedroom apartment in nearby Pacific Heights . But instead of buying , the Wollacks signed a lease . " My friends and I , who are all over 50 , shake our heads at the values of our homes and of our stocks , " says Wollack . " It 's not that we wish for a crash , but we know it will come sometime . " <p> Rothe and Wollack talk about all this with cool reserve . A home , they both say , should n't be just an investment . But it 's also clear neither of them want to lose money . Rothe is pouring $775,000 into his 2,000-square-foot apartment . Wollack , who sold his house for more than $4 million , signed a $10,000-a-month lease for a 2,500-square-foot unit . <p> Own your apartment or buy it ? Neither option is cheap , particularly for the high-end apartments . We 're talking 2,000 square feet and up , often with commanding views and amenities like doormen . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month in rent . <p> But before you recoil at the thought of spending that much on rent , run the numbers . If big-city apartment markets cool or stagnate , renting will save you cash . A serious real estate correction would make that $7,500 a month look like money well spent . <p> If you 're going to stay put for many , many years , there 's an argument to be made for buying . The considerable tax advantages of owning add up over time and overcome the fact that you may be buying near a peak in the market . But most apartment dwellers do n't stick around for decades . The average duration for living in a single-family home is six years and for a rental apartment , two and a half years . <p> Rent or buy ? Here 's a simple formula to figure out what makes sense . It 's used to determine what real estate pros call the " capitalization rate , " a sort of inverse P/E ratio for property investors . Begin by determining what the apartment you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subtract all expenses and property taxes ( 30% of the rent is a good rule of thumb ) and multiply by 12 to get the annual net operating income . Divide the net operating income by the purchase price . The resulting percentage gives you a very useful number . ( For some help with the math , go to www.forbes.com . ) <p> Historically , residential cap rates have been between 5% and 10% . Think of this cap rate as the dividend yield on your investment , comparable to the dividend you get on a real estate investment trust . When cap rates are high , buy . When they are low , sell . <p> Your total return on an investment is the sum of dividends and capital gains . Say you buy a condo cheap enough to pocket a 7% cap rate  --  that is , you 're getting a 7% net rental return by acting as your own landlord . And let 's say property prices appreciate an average of 3% a year over the time you hold on . Your total return is 10% a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced market offering only a 3% cap rate . With yields that low , property prices will probably be under pressure in coming years , as more and more couples like the Wollacks figure they are better off renting . Perhaps appreciation averages out to a mere 1% a year . Total return : a miserable 4% annually . You 'd probably do better putting your capital into a real estate investment trust . The good ones offer rich yields these days , between 6% and 10% , and also offer some hope of modest appreciation . <p> What if yields on REITs and yields on owner-occupied houses are about the same  --  say , 7% ? Let 's say you could either sink $1 million into a condo with an effective net operating income of $70,000 a year , or you could put the same $1 million into a REIT yielding $70,000 in cash dividends . Then the tax laws push you very strongly in favor of buying the condo , not the REIT . Your REIT dividends are partly or fully taxable . An owner-occupied condo 's rental value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , can deduct property taxes , and gets a partial exemption from capital gain taxes when he moves , notes James Banahan , a credit analyst with National Cooperative Bank in New York . <p> We have constructed a table to help you figure out whether to sign a lease or a sales contract in seven cities . We 're using typical rents and purchase prices for high-end units , as provided by brokers . In New York ( cap rate : 7% ) , for instance , the rents are astronomical because of its density and renewed cachet . This makes buying a condo or co-op the smartest move . Up the coast in Boston ( cap rate : 2% ) , however , the rents are n't that crazy , which makes a lease a better deal . <p> We can not predict what will happen to rental values and property prices . But we can say that you 've got better odds for appreciation if you buy where cap rates are high and better odds for a price decline if you buy where cap rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife Kathleen , 38 , looked at moving their two children to Manhattan from the suburbs ; they planned to rent . " We looked around for $3,000-a-month places , and were appalled at how small they all looked , " Curtis says . <p> The Browns ended up buying a 2,000-square-foot apartment in a building designed by famed architect I.M. Pei . The purchase price was $860,000 . The monthly expenses , taxes and mortgage are $6,500 . <p> Brown believes he got a good deal , and he may be right . New York real estate broker Barbara Corcoran says the Browns would pay $8,500 a month to rent an apartment like the one they bought . Putting aside the matter of how the Browns financed their purchase , a net operating income of $71,400 makes the Browns ' cap rate 8.3% . The unit 's value can slide 9% in the next three years and owning still will beat renting . <p> Real estate in Washington is cheaper than in New York or San Francisco . And Christopher Beakey could probably afford to buy . But Beakey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut feeling he should stick to renting  --  that his $1,200-a-month , 1,000-square-foot apartment near Dupont Circle is a better deal than he could get buying . He 's probably right . Audna L. Nicholson , an agent at Long &; Foster Real Estate , doubts she can sell him an apartment as big as the one he has for less than $250,000 . Beaky would be buying at a 4% cap rate  --  a modest cool-off in the apartment market could fray Beakey 's finances . <p> Apart from the cold calculations , instinct will play some role in your decision whether to buy . Bill Rothe is probably getting a 4.3% or so cap rate on his San Francisco apartment . But he contends prices will rise . " San Francisco is a very nice city , surrounded on three sides by water , and there 's an utter lack of supply , " he says . Strict zoning keeps tall buildings out of his neighborhood . <p> Renter Dick Wollack , though , predicts that the baby boom generation will leave town when it 's time to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderation in the economy and maybe a drop in the Internet stocks , " he says , " and I 'm just not sure real estate prices will keep going up . " Is the Price Right ? <p> Both buying and renting high-end apartments are expensive in these cities . The higher the cap rate , the better buying looks . Also , here 's what to do if prices rise , fall or stay put over three years . TABLE <p> Sources : Boston : Prudential gibson ; DeWolfe .
