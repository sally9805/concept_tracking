#1997 On the desk in my candlelit study , the telephone rang , and I knew that a terrible change was coming . I am not psychic . I do not see signs and portents in the sky . To my eye , the lines in my palm reveal nothing about my future , and I do n't have a Gypsy 's ability to discern the patterns of fate in wet tea leaves . My father had been dying for days , however , and after spending the previous night at his bedside , blotting the sweat from his brow and listening to his labored breathing , I knew that he could n't hold on much longer . I dreaded losing him and being , for the first time in my twenty-eight years , alone . I am an only son , an only child , and my mother passed away two years ago . Her death had been shock , but at least she had not been forced to endure a lingering illness . Last night just before dawn , exhausted , I had returned home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I leaned forward in my chair and willed the phone to fall silent , but it would not . The dog also knew what the ringing meant . He padded out of the shadows into the candleglow , and stared sorrowfully at me . Unlike the others of his kind , he will hold any man 's or woman 's gaze as long as he is interested . Animals usually stare directly at us only briefly - then look away as though unnerved by something they see in the human eyes . Perhaps Orson sees what other dogs see , and perhaps he , too , is disturbed by it , but he is not intimidated . He is a strange dog . But he is my dog , my steadfast friend , and I love him . On the seventh ring , I surrender to the inevitable and answer the phone . The caller was a nurse at Mercy Hospital . I spoke to her without looking away from Orson . My father was quickly fading . The nurse suggested I come to his bedside without delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and rested his burly black head in my lap . He whimpered softly and nuzzled my hand . He did not wag his tail . For a moment I was numb , unable to think or act . The silence of the house , as deep as water in an oceanic abyss , was a crushing , immobilizing pressure . Then I phoned Sasha Goodall to ask her to drive me to the hospital . Usually she slept from noon until eight o'clock . She spun music in the dark , from midnight until six o'clock in the morning , on KBAY , the only radio station in Moonlight Bay . At a few minutes past five on this March evening , she was most likely asleep , and I regretted the need to wake her . Like sad-eyed Orson , however , Sasha was my friend , to whom I could always turn . And she was a far better driver than the dog . She answered on the second ring , with no trace of sleepiness in her voice . Before I could tell her what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " as though she had been waiting for this call and as if in the ringing of her phone she had heard the same ominous note the Orson and I had heard in mine . I bit my lip and refused to consider what was coming . As long as Dad was alive , hope remained that his doctors were wrong . Even at the eleventh hour , the cancer might go into remission . I believe in the possibility of miracles . After all , in spite of my condition , I have lived more than twenty-eight years , which is a miracle of sorts - although some other people , seeing my life from outside , might think it is a curse . I believe in the possibility of miracles , but more to the point , I believe in our need for them . " I 'll be there in five minutes , " Sasha promised . At night I could walk to the hospital , but at this hour I would be too much of a spectacle and in too great a danger if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Drive carefully . I 'll probably take ten minutes or more to get ready . " " Love you , Snowman . " " Love you , " I replied . I replaced the cap on the pen with which I had been writing when the call came from the hospital , and I put it aside with the yellow legal-size tablet . Using a long-handled brass snuffer , I extinguished the three fat candles . Thin , sinuous ghosts of smoke writhed in the shadows . Now , an hour before twilight , the sun was low in the sky but still dangerous . It glimmered threateningly at the edges of the pleated shades that covered all the windows . Anticipating my intentions , as usual , Orson was already out of the room , padding across the upstairs hall . He is a ninety-pound Labrador mix , as black as a witch 's cat . Through the layered shadows of our house , he roams all but invisibly , his presence betrayed only by the thump of his big paws on the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardwood floors . In my bedroom , across the hall from the study , I did n't bother to switch on the dimmer-controlled , frosted-glass ceiling fixture . The indirect , sour-yellow light of the westering sun , pressing at the edges of the window shades , was sufficient for me . My eyes are better adapted to gloom than are those of most people . Although I am , figuratively speaking , a brother to the owl , I do n't have a special gift for nocturnal sight , nothing as romantic or as thrilling as a paranormal talent . Simply this : Lifelong habituation to darkness has sharpened my night vision . Orson leaped onto the footstool and then curled on the armchair to watch me as I girded myself for the sunlit world . From a pullman drawer in the adjoining bathroom , I withdrew a squeeze bottle of lotion that included a sunscreen with a rating of fifty . I applied it generously to my face , ears , and neck . The lotion had a faint coconut scent , an aroma that I associate with palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with noontime light , and other things that will be forever beyond my experience . This , for me , is the fragrance of desire and denial and hopeless yearning , the succulent perfume of the unattainable . Sometimes I dream that I am walking on a Caribbean beach in a rain of sunshine , and the white sand under my feet seems to be a cushion of pure radiance . The warmth of the sun on my skin is more erotic than a lover 's touch . In the dream , I am not merely bathed in light but pierced by it . When I wake , I am bereft . Now the lotion , although smelling of the tropical sun , was cool on my face and neck . I also worked it into my hands and wrists . The bathroom featured a single window at which the shade was currently raised , but the space remained meagerly illuminated because the glass was frosted and because the incoming sunlight was filtered through the graceful limbs of the metrosideros . The silhouettes of leaves fluttered on the pane . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a shadow . Even if I switched on the light , I would not have had a clear look at myself , because the single bulb in the overhead fixture was of low wattage and had a peach tint . Only rarely have I seen my face in full light . Sasha says that I remind her of James Dean , more as he was in East of Eden than in Rebel Without a Cause . I myself do n't perceive the resemblance . The hair is the same , yes , and the pale blue eyes . But he looked so wounded , and I do not see myself that way . I am not James Dean . I am no one but me , Christopher Snow , and I can live with that . Finished with the lotion , I returned to the bedroom . Orson raised his head from the armchair to savor the coconut scent . I was already wearing athletic socks , Nikes , blue jeans , and a black t-shirt . I quickly pulled on a black denim shirt with long sleeves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foyer . Because the porch was deep with a low ceiling , and because two massive California live oaks stood in the yard , no direct sun could reach the sidelights flanking the front door ; consequently , they were not covered with curtains or blinds . The leaded panes - geometric mosaics of clear , green , red , and amber glass - glowed softly like jewels . I took a zippered , black leather jacket from the coat closet . I would be out after dark , and even following a mild March day , the central coast of California can turn chilly when the sun goes down . From the closet shelf , I snatched a navy blue , billed cap and pulled it on , tugging it low on my head . Across the front , above the visor , in ruby-red embroidered letters , were the words Mystery Train . One night during the previous autumn , I had found the cap in Fort Wyvern , the abandoned military base inland from Moonlight Bay . It had been the only object in a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea to what the embroidered words might refer , I had kept the cap because it intrigued me . As I turned toward the front door , Orson whined beseechingly . I stooped and petted him . " I 'm sure Dad would like to see you one last time , fella . I know he would . But there 's no place for you in a hospital . " His direct , coal-black eyes glimmered . I could have sworn that his gaze brimmed with grief and sympathy . Maybe that was because I was looking at him through repressed tears of my own . My friend Bobby Halloway says that I tend to anthropomorphize animals , ascribing to them human attributes and attitudes which they do not , in fact , possess . Perhaps this is because animals , unlike some people , have always accepted me for what I am . The four-legged citizens of Moonlight Bay seem to possess a more complex understanding of life - as well as more kindness - than at least some of my neighbors . Bobby tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sign of immaturity . I tell Bobby to go copulate with himself . I comforted Orson , stroking his glossy coat and scratching behind his ears . He was curiously tense . Twice he cocked his head to listen intently to sounds I could not hear - as if he sensed a threat looming , something even worse than the loss of my father . At that time , I had not yet seen anything suspicious about Dad 's impending death . Cancer was only fate , not murder - unless you wanted to try bringing criminal charges against God . That I had lost both parents within two years , that my mother had died when she was only fifty-two , that my father was only fifty-six as he lay on his deathbed ... well , all this just seemed to be my poor luck - which had been with me , literary , since my conception . Later , I would have reason to recall Orson 's tension - and good reason to wonder if he had sensed the tidal wave of trouble washing toward us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am doing worse than anthropomorphizing the mutt , that now I am ascribing superhuman attributes to him . I would have to agree - and then tell Bobby to go copulate vigorously with himself . Anyway , I petted and scratched and generally comforted Orson until a horn sounded in the street and then , almost at once , sounded again in the driveway . Sasha had arrived . In spite of the sunscreen of my neck , I turned up the collar of my jacket for additional protection . From the Stickely-style foyer table under a print of Maxfield Parrish 's Daybreak , I grabbed a pair of wraparound sunglasses . With my hand on the hammered-copper doorknob , I turned to Orson once more . " We 'll be all right . " In fact I did n't know quite how we could go on without my father . He was our link to the world of light and to the people of the day . More than that , he loved me as no one left on earth could love me , as only a parent could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one would ever understand me again . " We 'll be all right , " I repeated . The dog regarded me solemnly and chuffed once , almost pityingly , as if he knew I was lying . I opened the front door , and as I went outside , I put on the wraparound sunglasses . The special lenses were totally UV-proof . My eyes are my point of greatest vulnerability . I can take no risk whatsoever with them . Sasha 's green Ford Explorer was in the driveway , with the engine running , and she was behind the wheel . I closed the house door and locked it . Orson had made no attempt to slip out at my heels . A breeze had sprung up from the west : an onshore flow with the faint , astringent scent of the sea . The leaves of the oaks whispered as if transmitting secrets branch to branch . My chest grew so tight that my lungs felt constricted , as was always the case when I was required to venture outside in the daylight . This symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch steps and along the flagstone walk to the driveway , I felt weighed down . Perhaps this was how a deep-sea diver might feel in a pressure suit with a kingdom of water overhead . CHAPTER TWO When I got into the Explorer , Sasha Goodall said quietly , " Hey , Snowman . " " Hey . " I buckled my safety harness as Sasha shifted into reverse . From under the bill of my cap , I peered at the house as we backed away from it , wondering how it would appear to me when next I saw it . I felt that when my father left this world , all of the things that belonged to him would look shabbier and diminished because they would no longer be touched by his spirit . It is Craftsmen-period structure , in the Greene and Greene tradition : ledger stone set with minimal mortar , cedar siding silvered by weather and time , entirely modern in its lines but not in the least artificial or insubstantial , fully on the earth and formidable . After the recent winter rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a green coverlet of lichen . As we reversed into the street , I thought that I saw the shade nudged aside at one of the living-room windows , at the back of the deep porch , and Orson 's face at the pane , his paws on the sill . As she drove away from the house , Sasha said , " How long since you 've been out in this ? " " Daylight ? A little over nine years . " " A novena to the darkness . " She was also a songwriter . I said , " Damn it , Goodall , do n't wax poetic on me . " " What happened nine years ago ? " " Appendicitis . " " Ah . The time you almost died . " " Only death brings me out in daylight . " She said , " At least you got a sexy scar from it . " " You think so ? " " I like to kiss it , do n't I ? " " I 've wondered about that . " " Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You might have died . " " Did n't . " " I kiss it like I 'm saying a little prayer of thanks . That you 're here with me . " " Or maybe you 're sexually aroused by deformity . " " Asshole . " " Your mother never taught you language like that . " " It was the nuns in parochial school . " I said , " You know what I like ? " " We 've been together almost two years . Yeah , I think I know what you like . " " I like that you never cut me any slack . " " Why should I ? " she asked . " Exactly . " Even in my armor of cloth and lotion , behind the shades that shielded my sensitive eyes from ultraviolet rays , I was unnerved by the day around me and above me . I felt egg shell-fragile in its vise grip . Sasha was aware of my uneasiness but pretended not to notice . To take my mind off both the threat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she does so well - which is be Sasha . " Where will you be later ? " she asked . " When it 's over . " " If it 's over . They could be wrong . " " Where will you be when I 'm on the air ? " " After midnight ... probably Bobby 's place . " " Make sure he turns on his radio . " " Are you taking requests tonight ? " I asked . " You do n't have to call in . I 'll know what you need . " At the next corner , she swung the Explorer right , onto Ocean Avenue . She drove uphill , away from the sea . Fronting the shops and restaurants beyond the deep sidewalks , eighty-foot stone pines spread wings of branches across the street . The payment was feathered with shadow and sunshine . Moonlight Bay , home to twelve thousand people , rises from the harbor and flatlands into gentle serried hills . In most California travel guides , our town is called the Jewel of the Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have this sobriquet widely used . The town has earned the name , however , for many reasons , not least of which is our wealth of trees . Majestic oaks with hundred-year crowns . Pines , cedars , phoenix palms . Deep eucalyptus groves . My favorites are the clusters of lacy melaleuca luminaria draped with stoles of ermine blossoms in the spring . As a result of our relationship , Sasha has applied protective film to the Explorer windows . Nevertheless , the view was shockingly brighter than that to which I was accustomed . I slid my glasses down my nose and peered over the frames . The pine needles stitched an elaborate dark embroidery on a wondrous purple-blue , late afternoon sky bright with mystery , and a reflection of this pattern flickered across the windshield . I quickly pushed my glasses back in place , not merely to protect my eyes but because suddenly I was ashamed for taking such delight in this rare daytime journey even as my father lay dying . Judiciously speeding , never braking to a full stop at those intersections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with you . " " That 's not necessary . " Sasha 's intense dislike of doctors and nurses and all the things medical bordered on a phobia . Most of the time she was convinced that she would live forever ; she had great faith in the power of vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , positive thinking , and mind-body healing techniques . A visit to any hospital , however , temporarily shook her conviction that she would avoid the fate of all flesh . " Really , " she said , " I should be with you . I love your dad . " Her outer calm was belied by a quiver in her voice , and I was touched by her willingness to go , just for me , where she most loathed to go . I said , " I want to be alone with him , this little time we have . " " Truly ? " " Truly . Listen , I forgot to leave dinner out for Orson . Could you go back to the house and take care of that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a task . " Poor Orson . He and your dad were real buddies . " " I swear he knows . " " Sure . Animals know things . " " Especially Orson . " From Ocean Avenue , she turned left onto Pacific View . Mercy Hospital was two blocks away . She said , " He 'll be okay . " " He does n't show it much , but he 's already grieving in his way . " " I 'll give him lots of hugs and cuddles . " " Dad was his link to the day . " " I 'll be his link now , " she promised . " He ca n't live exclusively in the dark . " " He 's got me , and I 'm not going anywhere . " " Are n't you ? " I asked . " He 'll be okay . " We were n't really talking about the dog anymore . The hospital is a three-story California Mediterranean structure built in another age when that term did not bring to mind uninspired tract-house architecture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames . Ground-floor rooms are shaded by loggias with arches and limestone columns . Some of the columns are entwined by the woody vines of ancient bougainvillea that blanket loggia roofs . This day , even with spring a couple weeks away , cascades of crimson and radiant purple flowers overhung the eaves . For a daring few seconds , I pulled my sunglasses down my nose and marveled at the sun-splashed celebration of color . Sasha stopped at a side entrance . As I freed myself from the safety harness , she put one hand on my arm and squeezed lightly . " Call my cellular number when you want me to come back . " " It 'll be after sunset by the time I leave . I 'll walk . " " If that 's what you want . " " I do . " Again I drew the glasses down my nose , this time to see Sasha Goodall as I had never seen her . In candlelight , her gray eyes are deep but clear - as they are here in the day world , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lustrous as wine in crystal - but markedly more lustrous under the stroking hand of the sun . Her creamy , rose petal skin is flecked with faint freckles , the patterns which I know as well as I know the constellations in every quadrant of the night sky , season by season . With one finger , Sasha pushed my sunglasses back into place . " Do n't be foolish . " I 'm human . Foolish is what we are . If I were to go blind , however , her face would be a sight to sustain me in the lasting blackness . I leaned across the console and kissed her . " You smell like coconut , " she said . " I try . " I kissed her again . " You should n't be out in this any longer , " she said firmly . The sun , half an hour above the sea , was orange and intense , a perpetual thermonuclear holocaust ninety-three million miles removed . In places , the Pacific was molten copper . " Go coconut boy . Away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got out of the Explorer and hurried to the hospital , tucking my hands in the pockets of my leather jacket . I glanced back once . Sasha was watching . She gave me a thumbs up sign
