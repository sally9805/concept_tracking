I could n't make up my mind about the Oakland , California , school board 's decision last month to certify Ebonics as an official language for black folks , so I decided to consult the experts . I put in a call to the Home for Retired Racial Stereotypes in a black section of Hollywood . The Kingfish answered . " Holy mack'rul dere , Andy , somebody wants to talk ' bout dis ' ere Ebonics . Could you or Tonto tell Buckwheat come to da phone ? He de resident expert . " <P> " Here I is , " squeaked the famous Our Gang character a few moments later , before dropping into a baritone so deep I thought it was James Earl Jones . " Farina , Stymie and I only spoke that way in the movies because white people wrote the scripts , " Buckwheat explained . " Our parents and teachers would never let us get away with speaking anything but proper English when we were n't working . The Kingfish usually speaks properly too , but he 's hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a comeback . " <P> Trying to conceal my amazement , I asked what Buckwheat thought of Ebonics . " In my opinion , " he replied , " the entire controversy could have been avoided easily if the Oakland school board knew how to speak better English . They had the right idea , after all . It makes perfect sense to help teachers understand that youngsters from underclass neighborhoods speak differently from other Americans and that their distinctive speech patterns do n't mean the kids are stupid . " He continued , " In fact , school systems in California and other states have been using this idea since the 1970s , when some scholars concluded that Black English is a distinct language with its own grammatical rules . Since more than half the black students in Oakland drop out before they finish high school , officials have to do something . If you ca n't hook them on phonics , it 's certainly worth trying to hook them on Ebonics . " <P> He paused briefly to gather his thoughts . " But that common-sense message got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much Afrocentric jargon and education-speak that people thought the board was trying to dumb down the curriculum by teaching bad grammar and syntax . There was enough mangled phraseology in its resolution to make 16 episodes of Martin . But wait , let me get the Kingfish in on this . He 's an expert on malapropisms . " <P> The Kingfish came back on the line . " Dat 's right , Brother White . When I perused the resolution from de school board , I thought somebody had made a typogirraffical error . Take dis ' ere sentence , which I quotes verbitim : ' Studies have also demonstrated that African Language Systems are genetically based and not a dialect of English . ' Up on Lennox Avenue , dat means dat black children ca n't speak properly because of dere heredity . It sound like one of my schemes for trickin ' Andy out of his money . " <P> " Quite so , " Buckwheat chimed in . " Why would anyone throw around highfalutin ' phrases like ' Pan African Communications Behaviors ' unless they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for ghetto kids ? "
