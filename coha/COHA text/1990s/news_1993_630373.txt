WASHINGTON OUR nation 's capital is filling with nouveau New Dealers , social engineers , men and women with a glint in the eye . All are anticipating the orgies . There is a stimulus bill of $787 billion , an appropriation bill of $410 billion , a housing bailout bill of $275 billion , and the Prophet Obama 's colossal budget , promising $3.55 trillion of expenditures ( including a $634 billion " down payment " on health care reform ) . My heart goes out to the American taxpayer , of course , but , somewhat to my surprise , I reserve a special sadness for former president Bill Clinton . In his party he is a dinosaur . Today , as the Obamaists swarm through Washington , the centrist from the 1990s must feel forlorn . For years it has been his boast that he balanced the federal budget and maintained vigorous economic growth . He expanded free trade and , working bipartisanly with Republicans , reformed welfare . People left the welfare rolls and took remunerative employment . Usually federal spending hovers around 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 18.4 percent- the lowest level since 1966 . Bill said " the era of big government is over , " and he meant it . Today his party has passed him by . Bill , can we now be friends ? I apologize for all my past rudeness , even the jokes . It is a matter of public record that you have made friends with Dick Scaife . Allow me to be next . Let us convene a conference . We could explore market solutions to public problems and together we could promulgate a manifesto on free trade . I shall bring some friends from the Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institution- PhDs . Perhaps we can plot how to re-reform welfare after the Obama administration shanghais the poor back into the welfare trap . Under the Prophet , federal expenditures will soar to 27.7 percent of GDP . That is the highest rate of expenditure since 1945 . The deficit will hit $1.7 trillion this year and after a brief decline rise above $700 billion . His budget contemplates a recovery , but in 2010 spending will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , he will raise taxes and cut the military . Though we are mired in a recession whose recovery is still in doubt , the Obama administration is going to move on all fronts . As his White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , has said , " Never let a serious crisis go to waste . " If you are suffering from the recession you might find Emanuel 's line callous , but that is just the way Democrats talk nowadays . Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton put it this way : " Never waste a good crisis . " Both of these crisisists apparently believe there is something systemic in the United States that needs to be radically changed . Perhaps they think that the past 25 years of growth that began with the Reagan administration and continued through the administration of Emanuel 's former boss , Bill Clinton , was a failure . So working simultaneously the Obama administration is going to fix the banking crisis , the housing crisis , and the economic slowdown . That is not all . It promises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nationalized energy policy abundant with green energy funded and regulated by the government . With all of this hurly-burly going on I hope my new friend is not going to suffer the blues . In less than four years his presidency is going to be looked back on fondly by Democrats and even by me . I think it is increasingly evident that Bill 's Democratic successor is the most ill-prepared man to serve as president in a long time . My mind goes back to President Abraham Lincoln 's abrupt successor , Andrew Johnson . Mr. Obama 's problems in staffing his government suggest as much , as does the low quality of many of his nominees , at least the nominees who were not dropped for tax irregularities or for being under grand jury investigation . Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner looks and sounds like an undergraduate . His colleague Peter Orszag is hardly better . In the months ahead we shall see what other duds the president has brought aboard . So cheer up , Bill . Your legacy is going to look fine , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Already things are turning against the Prophet . Just the other day Howard Fineman , writing on the Newsweek website , noted that " the American establishment is taking his the president 's measure and , with surprising swiftness , they are finding him lacking . " Bill , let 's have a beer .
