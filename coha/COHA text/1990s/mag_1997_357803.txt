What is it about politicians from Tennessee and campaign-finance investigations ? AL GORE is sweating one , FRED THOMPSON folded one and now a rainmaker for LAMAR ALEXANDER , a former and possibly future presidential candidate , is involved in another . In September , federal agents seized documents from the offices of Beaulieu of America , a Dalton , Ga. , carpet company run by CARL BOUCKAERT , a key money raiser for the former Governor of Tennessee . Beaulieu , the third largest carpet manufacturer in the U.S. , was a target of a Justice Department price-fixing probe , but was not charged . Investigators are now looking into whether or not the company reimbursed employees for contributions made to the plain-talking , plaid-shirted candidate 's 1996 presidential campaign . It was precisely a scheme of that sort that cost one of Bob Dole 's moneymen a $1 million fine . <P>  --  By John Dickerson/Washington
