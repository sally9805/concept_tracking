IT IS ONE Of those deep summer nights in mid-July when people in Libertyberg , Mississippi , wonder how they survived before they had air conditioning . Sometimes that is all people talk about , what it was like when all they had were . fans , and how these young people today ca n't possibly imagine it , here with all the modern conveniences in 1965 . It is the sort of conversation that Winnie and Virginia Bloom-er , two women with the accidental relationship of having married brothers , often have . Virginia visits Winnie several times a week to talk aimlessly to her , to take her mind off things , off the ' , accident " that Winnie 's husband had three months ago . <p> Those conversations annoy Sheridan , Winnie 's only daughter . All that talk about fans " bugs " her , she tells them . Bugs the everlovin ' hell out of her , she tells herself . <p> This is one of those deep summer nights . Except that tonight Win-nie is n't talking about anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Winnie begins to close up the living room in preparation for bed . She has the blues again , Sheridan can tell by the way she walks . Sleepwalking , it looks like , as if Winnie is drifting in a dream that her husband , Fred , haunts . Sometimes she looks like a ghost , too , sleeping off the weeks since she found Fred in the closed garage , slumped behind the wheel of the station wagon , the motor running . She refuses to drive the car now , even to church or to the grocery store . <p> " Sheridan , " she often says , fumbling in her purse for a couple of dollars and her key ring . " Run over to the Jitney Jungle and get yourself something for supper . " But most of the time Winnie does n't even think about errands like grocery shopping . <p> She hands the car keys to Sheridan , as if she is giving her daughter freedom from her own world , a world she escapes to when she goes to her bedroom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with Fred 's half-empty bottles of after-shave , with his hunting vest and Sunday suit hanging in the closet and his keys still lying in the pewter tray on the bureau where he would empty his pockets at night . Sheridan does n't see Winnie again until she shuffles around the kitchen making her fee twelve hours later , the pockets of her robe bulging with Kleenex , her eyes swollen . <p> Sheridan is glad to see her pulling the blinds tonight . They slap against the windows with a shush , signaling that she can slip out in the station wagon . Six weeks ago her steady boyfriend , Ernie Crenshaw , came to the last day of school with passion marks on his neck that a cheerleader gave him after a baseball game , and now there is little for Sheridan to do on these long summer nights . But most of the time she tells herself that she is glad to be alone . She does n't even want another boy calling her , giving her his oversized ring to wear just so he can unbutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libertyberg Herald reported her father 's suicide in a lower corner of the front page , Sheridan avoids even her friends , leaving the phone off the hook , and taking detours so she wo n't have to drive past the crowded pizza parlor on Main Street or the Teen Center near Libertyberg High . <p> The station wagon is her always runs the air conditioner so high in her bedroom that the noise drowns out the sound o the car cranking up . Then , when Winnie 's door is closed and her lights are out , Sheridan heads out the highway , down the country roads where there is nothing but the speed of the car , the sound of rock ' n roll turned up on the radio , and the warm wind flooding against her face while she barrels through the summer of 1965 on thirty-two-cent gallons of gasoline . <p> That is how Sheridan finds out about the hermaphrodite down at the swinging bridge outside of town . She stops to get gas on Highway 58 , and the attendant sizes her up when she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the pump handle , looking as if he is performing an unnatural act with the car . <p> " Your eyes botherin ' you ? " He squints his eyes into slits and tilts up his head so he can see out from under the blue brim of his cap . <p> Sheridan just looks at him . <p> " Well they 're abotherin ' me , " he says . He cackles and slaps his leg . And then he takes a closer look . <p> " Say , ai n't you kinda young to be out and about by yourself ? You ai n't going down to the swinging bridge , are you ? " He spits into the gravel . " Too many kids going down there . That ole critter down there never hurt nobody . " <p> He shifts the handle of the gas pump , jiggling it to get out the last drop . " Well you just be careful if you going to see that there hermitire . You ai n't meetin ' some boy down there , are you ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but she is , nevertheless , curious . A hermitite ? Was this one of those cults Winnie and Virginia talk about ? A shaved-head Tibetan , maybe , who 's wound up in Mississippi ? she wonders . <p> She asks at the truck stop down the road when she stops for a cup of coffee . <p> The waitress shakes her head , and her coil of yellow hair wobbles . " Some say it 's half-man , half-woman , but I do n't believe ' em . Hon , long as I 've lived here , there 's been a story that he run off from a circus and holed up down there on the river . Buncha folks used to run a bet about who could get a picture of it , to say , you know , if it 's man or woman . Nobody ever did get it . " She looks up from under the hood that her bouffant hair makes over her face . " He comes in here sometimes , do n't say hardly no word to nobody . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawdads and catfish too long . Been alone too damn long . Should n't nobody live all by theirself . But I reckon he likes it . " <p> The jukebox explodes with rock ' n roll , and she jiggles away to the Big Bopper 's " Chantlily Lace . " " Leave him alone , hon , " she tosses over one bony shoulder . She wrenches her body into a version of the twist like a rubber band wound up and then let loose . Then she quits just as quick , pulls out her order pad for the two men at the next table . They look like they are used to her . <p> They are staring at Sheridan , not at the waitress . Sheridan thinks it is because she has dyed her hair red , just for a change . Winnie noticed it , and she was mad for awhile , saying it looked like pink food coloring . But then even the spark of anger was gone in Winnie . <p> Sheridan stirs a spoonful of sugar into her coffee . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough as it is to me . " One of them winks at her and takes a deep swig of the beer that has been set in front of him . <p> She sips her coffee , wondering whether it would be bad manners to leave as soon as she was served . <p> " Cat got your tongue ? " He winks again . <p> " Mabel been tellin ' you about that queer thing down there on the river ? You wan na go see it , honey ? " The other one tums his chair around to face Sheridan . <p> Years later Sheridan will remember that shirt he is wearing . Big red checks cover it , and the front is unbuttoned far enough to show his curly chest hair . His friend is skinny , and a cheap Kodak hangs from a string around his neck . He has bulging green eyes that seem to pop out of his head when he winks . She will have to describe the men to the police , so she will remember those details long after the night has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sheridan flounces her new red hair and looks them straight in their eyes so she wo n't look scared . " Where ' does it stay ? " <p> They look at each other , as if they are trying to read each other 's mind . The skinny one speaks first , his Adam 's apple jerking up and down in his neck . " Why , we 'll take you there , sugar . " He lifts his camera . " We 'll get a picture of you with it , win you a bet , maybe . It ai n't far , first road to the left takes you far as the river bottom , and there he is . Lives in a cabin with fish lines out in front . " <p> Sheridan 's hands are trembling as she sets the cup back in its saucer . " Thanks for the offer . " She smiles at them politely . Winnie has taught her always to be polite . But when they grin and start to push their chairs back , she adds , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . " <p> Their faces fall into mean expressions and the big one raises his bushy eyebrows at her . " Well you just be careful down there , " he growls . " Some say it 's a dangerous critter . Teenage couple got shot a few years back . They never pinned it on nobody . " He mashes out a cigarette on the floor . The neon light outside the window that announces " World 's Strongest Coffee " is flashing on his face , turning his features red , then yellow , then blue , a kaleidoscope arranging itself on the topography of his bulbous nose , his creased forehead . <p> Sheridan is getting what she calls " spooked . " She puts down a quarter and walk ' but . The waitress is twisting again . She has dropped a dime in the juke box for the Everly Brothers ' song " Bird Dog " this time . " Hey bird dog , get away from my quail , hey bird dog you 're on the wrong trail .... " The skirt of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tops of her pink stockings show . Later , she will tell the police she did n't remember when Sheridan left . <p> Outside the crickets are making noises like an invisible factory might be hidden in the trees . A cool , musty smell comes up from the river , tasting like swamp water when Sheridan licks her lips . She has heard that the black churches have baptisms down there . She can imagine it : whole lines of children and adults dressed in white marching down to the river and then streaming back muddied from washing their sins away , singing about heaven and angels . But that , she thinks , is another world entirely . <p> Sheridan cranks up the station wagon and the radio blares out . It is Peter and Gordon : " I do n't care what they say , I wo n't stay in a world without lo-ove .... " In the rearview mirror she catches a glimpse of the red-checked shirt . Then a hand taps on the passenger window and Sheridan leans over to roll down the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him mad . <p> " Why , sugar , what you skeered at ? You mean you ai n't gon na open this door ? " <p> She has made him mad anyway , she thinks . She knows one thing : she does n't want to make him any madder . " I 'm on my way home , sir , " she lies . And then another sentence seems to come , unbidden , from her mouth : " My daddy 'll be awful mad if I do n't get his car back . " She smiles and waves the kind of white-gloved wave that homecoming queens at her high school give from the back of convertibles . The car eases away . <p> His friend has joined him , and she can see them in the rearview mirror for just a second , standing there frowning at her , until the road replaces them . Then all she can see behind her is a tunnel of kudzu vines unfolding as she speeds along , the radio blaring loud for company . <p> Sheridan thinks about the hermitire all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needs to talk to it . Is he really half and half ? How did he escape from the circus ? And  --  most important of all  --  how does he stand living so alone ? <p> She decides to get her cousin Ruby Ann  --  two years younger , so she is sure she can persuade her  --  to go with her to find him . And Ruby Ann can bring her father 's home-movie camera along , just to win them that bet . <p> Sheridan has it planned by the time she gets home . She aims the station wagon into the garage and before the headlights bear evenly on the wall ahead , they graze her father 's hunting rifle , still propped in one cobwebbed corner . As quickly as the light hits the gun , a thought flashes into her mind : Why could n't he have done it that way ? Why did we have to find him all limp and pale , his mouth slouched to the same side that his whole body had listed to behind the steering wheel that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open and emptied of breath as if his mouth were a pool drained of water , and she could suddenly see the mysterious bottom of it . He had looked as if he were caught in a cry that she 'd never been able to hear . Why that way , the thought comes again , uninvited , why did n't he just take the gun off to the woods like a manly soldier and ... <p> Sheridan is maneuvering the station wagon well , avoiding her bicycle on the right , the mower on the left . On other nights , she has scraped the fender against the mower so that little shreds of the " Gold-water in ' 64 " sticker on the front bumper are littering the concrete . But not tonight . Smooth as a hot knife through butter , she thinks . Deft , she often calls herself when she needs the praise . So she congratulates herself on a deft parking job when she turns off the ignition . She passes the dark window where Winnie 's air conditioner protrudes , dripping cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week until her Aunt Virginia gives Ruby Ann permission to go out . To the drive-in , Virginia thinks , to see the Beatles in A Hard Day 's Night . And even then she insists that Ruby Ann must be back by ten-thirty . So Sheridan tries to make good time when she picks up her cousin . They take the paper sack of popcorn Virginia has made for them and , while she is still in the kitchen , they slip to the hall closet to smuggle out the home-movie camera . As they shove it into the station wagon , Sheridan can see her Uncle Chester in the backyard hammock , enjoying the last of the evening light . His binoculars are to his eyes , trained up into the tree branches above him . A bird , she thinks . <p> And then she cranks the engine , and they are off , the camera rattling gently in its case on the backseat . <p> " I 'm not nervous , " says Ruby Ann suddenly , after several silent minutes . " Nothing bad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gum until she 's gotten all the sugar out and throwing the wads out the car window until two whole packs are gone . When she is n't fishing for another piece of Doublemint , she fiddles with the radio dial , trying to find a Little Rock station through the static . <p> " What 's really on at the drive-in ? " Ruby Ann looks as if the idea has just struck her . " My Fair Lady was on a couple of weeks ago . " A hopeful look crosses her face . " We could see Audrey Hepburn instead of some ole weird thing that does n't even know if it 's a girl or a boy . " <p> " Look , " Sheridan says , " if you do n't wan na go , just say so . " They are already ten miles down the highway toward the truck stop , and Sheridan really does n't want to have to come back all by herself . " Besides , " she glances over at Ruby Ann , " My Fair Ladys gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window and sighs . " Okay , let 's go . " She tums and sits up straight in her seat , like a kamikaze pilot bracing for the crash . <p> They are quiet , the car lights slicing ahead into the night , the sound of the crickets grating from the kudzu-covered trees lining the road  --  giant misshapen monsters , they look like , creaking with the frustrated noise crickets make . Ruby Ann has turned off the radio , giving up on the static that crackles between them and those faraway stations with their strange-sounding disc jockeys and all-night programs . <p> It is like they are n't even connected to the world , just speeding along through the tunnel of kudzu and asphalt that the highway becomes just north of town . Sheridan lets her hands fall to the bottommost curve of the steering wheel , and it is as if she is n't even driving anymore , just letting the station wagon be pulled along by invisible horses who know the way , with her and Ruby Ann sitting reinless in the buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sounds like the noise in a seashell , that secret sound that almost insists on silence . <p> Sheridan can see Ruby Ann 's face out of the corner of her eye . It is dappled with moon shadows that shift back and forth , with the patterns of leaves that shape and reshape like liquid lace . There is a funny feeling deep in Sheridan 's chest . She feels as if she can watch the two of them floating along like they are in some underwater memory of sound without meaning . <p> They pass the gas station , with its one pump and rusted Coke machine and its three public toilets : men , ladies , colored . They are getting close to the truck stop , close to the road that turns down to the river . <p> Sheridan glances over at Ruby Ann when they pass the flashing neon sign at the truck stop , the three words flashing first in a succession of red , yellow , and blue  --  World 's  --  Strongest  --  Coffee  --  and then together , three blinks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . First one on the left , remember . " Sheridan grips the steering wheel a little harder . <p> Ruby Ann just nods . She is so resigned to her destiny tonight that she does n't even bother to look over at her cousin . The sprinkles of shadows across her face have converged into a single darkness that hides her features from Sheridan , so that Sheridan can see only the shape of Ruby Ann 's head move , assenting . <p> And then Sheridan spots a break in the trees on the left . The car lights swing across the road , flashing into the bank of kudzu vines and then down a muddy passage sloping off into the woods and down to the river . She releases the steering wheel and lets it spin through her fingers while they bounce and jostle first into one rut , then another . She has to back up once when a tree branch catches in the fender . <p> Ruby Ann 's voice cuts through the sound of the car making its way into the woods . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's no way we can turn around on this road . " Her words come out slowly , as though she is carefully stringing them on a thread . " We ought to turn around as soon as we can . We ought to go back home . " <p> The road is getting muddier and flatter , and the river smell hangs stronger in the air , a dampness that clings to Sheridan 's skin . The trees are opening up again . <p> " We 're there , " she says , pointing ahead . " And there 's the old bridge . " <p> Ahead of them hangs a single lane suspended across the river under wooden poles . Planks lie across it , curling at both ends , refusing to lie flat . In some spots the boards have given way entirely . Sheridan flips the headlights on bright . Through a couple of holes in the bridge , the river is visible , glistening silver under the moon . A cypress knee sticks through the bridge where one of the planks has rotted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around that spot . It 's just a little hole , she thinks . <p> " Think it 's okay to cross ? " She can see a little cabin on the other side of the river , a square shadow against the trees . She tries to breathe slowly , to still the pounding in her chest . <p> Ruby Ann screeches when Sheridan slips the gear into drive . " Good God , nol Sheridan , so help me , if you drive across that thing ! will never , never go out with you again . Not even speak to you again . If we live . And if I die , I swear I 'll haunt you ! " <p> The shadows have lifted off Ruby Ann 's face now , and she stares , horrified , at the bridge ahead , her face itself looking like the full moon , round and shining in the light . <p> Sheridan shifts back into park , and heaves a sigh . " Okay . Have it your way . We 'll walk across then . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tucks her clutch purse under the car seat . <p> Ruby Ann still sits there , biting her thumbnail , clutching her purse in her lap . <p> " You coming ? Or you wan na wait for me ? " Sheridan has swung her legs out of the door , and she turns around to her cousin . <p> Ruby Ann glares at her . " I 'll come . But I 'm not leaving my purse here . " She swings the strap of her shoulder bag up over one shoulder and steps out into the mud . They make their way toward the bridge , the mud making sucking noises at their feet . Ruby Ann almost loses one of her shoes  --  new black leather fiats she 's just worn to the Fourth of July sock hop at the Teen Center , but she slips it back on and plows ahead . <p> Some of the boards on the bridge have come loose entirely , the nails pried up like rusty splinters . Someone has left old fishing lines tied to the poles  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotted string hang down , still and dry . <p> " Watch out for loose boards . " Sheridan glances over at Ruby Ann , who is stretching her thin legs from board to board , pausing to pick out the safest-looking ones . She is wearing madras bermuda shorts that are baggy on her , making her legs look like sticks . Sheridan suddenly feels sorry for her . Her new fiats are caked with mud ; her mouth is set in the same determined grim line that she used to put on her face when she was learning to ride her older sister 's bicycle , wobbling slowly down the driveway , deliberately crashing before she could careen into the street . <p> " Hey Ruby Ann . " Sheridan thinks she will lighten things up . " Remember how you used to fall off Amanda 's bike ? You look just like that now . " <p> " Shut up , Sheridan . " <p> They keep picking their way across in silence . Even the crickets have grown quiet . A few fireflies flicker in the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected places . <p> And then an explosion comes ringing out-like some giant firefly has blown itself up . Everything becomes bright in that moment , like lightning engraves things on the mind , or a photograph snatches a second out of time . Sheridan sees the curled plank she is about to step on , even the grayed knot in the board . Ruby Ann 's arms fly up in that instant as if she is pleading to the sky . The cypress stumps in the river seem to rise up out of the darkness like parts of a monster 's body half-submerged in the water . And then it is dark again , totally black this time , and Sheridan ca n't see anything for a few seconds . <p> A voice comes out of the blackness , a high-pitched whine . " Do n't y'all come no further . Do n't you take one more step thisaway . " <p> " Do n't shoot us . " It is Ruby Ann , but her voice is a croaking whisper . " Do n't shoot . " <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their faces , and Sheridan ca n't see anything again through its blinding ray . Not even Ruby Ann . The bridge sways and groans beneath their feet like someone has stepped onto it  --  and the light gets nearer . <p> The voice comes from behind the light . " What are you two gals doin ' out here ? What you want from me ? This ai n't no place for young kids . " The light is only a few feet away , and Sheridan can slowly make out a shape behind it . <p> The next voice she hears is her own , coming from her mouth in words she does n't know how she is forming . " Are you the hermitite ? I heard about you . I 'm Sheridan Bloomer , and this is my cousin Ruby Ann Bloomer . We 're pleased to meet you . We just wanted to visit you . I 'm all alone too , see , my dad just died . So I know how you feel . But we 'll leave if you want us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is clutching the camera , forgetting why she brought it . <p> Ruby Ann 's voice is stronger now . " Do n't shoot . Please God . Do n't shoot us . " <p> The light swings out of their faces and before them stands a squat figure with a hat slouched down over his eyes . Wisps of gray hair lie matted against his neck . He looks them over , his head cocked to one side like a pigeon . An oily shirt hangs out of his pants  --  khaki , the color of river water . <p> " What did you want to know ? " The voice sounds like one of Sheridan 's grandmother 's old scratched-up Victrola records played on high speed . <p> She looks at his face  --  greasy , beardless , and rutted with wrinkles . The eyes shine out at her like two raisins that have baked to the surface of an oatmeal cookie . A smell of fish grease hovers around the three of them standing there in a triangle in the middle of the bridge . Ruby Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm freezes midway , as if it forgot its destination . <p> The hermitite 's eyes flicker to a spot behind them and turn colder . Sheridan knows even before she hears the voices who is standing back there , and whose voice begins to speak . <p> " So you come back . Now what for ? What do you nice girls want out here ? " It is the one with the bushy eyebrows and the red-checked shirt . Sheridan does n't hear his words so much as she hears the sound of his voice coming nearer . The hermitire raises the shotgun to his face and takes aim through the squint of his left eye . <p> " Now you would n't do that , would you ? " It is the green-eyed man with the Adam 's apple . <p> His companion 's bushy eyebrows raise into a single hairy line and a chortle rises from his throat . " He do n't have the balls to do that .... Why , we brought him some company again , did n't we ? Ai n't you gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The hermitite 's gun moves steadily from one man to the other and back again , its aim focused just beyond Sheridan and Ruby Ann . <p> The fireflies crackle with a new electricity , as if they are sending out a desperate sign language to invisible angels . <p> Blam ! The blast whizzes past Sheridan so close that she can feel the heat and then the bridge tremble . In the seconds that follow , there is silence and then a moan . The checks on the red shirt are filling into one solid color , leaking down the front from a point at the shoulder . He is still standing , watching the color grow there on his belly , the fingers extended on his hands as if even they are surprised . <p> Then the whole bridge shakes and quivers . Ruby Ann screams and flings herself at Sheridan . Everything is splitting and the river surges up around them , a beast awakened . <p> Sheridan will never remember how they got back to the bank . She and Ruby Ann cling to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river . Something slimy disappears from under Sheridan 's hand once , slithering away into the warm water . <p> Ruby Ann finds a cypress root sticking out from the bank and they haul each other out of the river on it . Sheridan 's shoes are lost in the water . So is Chester 's movie camera . It is settling into the mud at the bottom of the river . The river bottom will claim the camera until only the lens protrudes , periscope-like , above the mud , and it is a curiosity for the catfish . <p> " Oh God , Sheridan . " Ruby Ann 's voice is cracked with tears . " Are we okay ? Are we okay ? " Mud plasters her hair down against her face . <p> The only thing Sheridan can think of is getting back to the safety of the car , getting out of there . She pulls Ruby Ann to her and they are hugging each other , half-crying , half-laughing . The hermitite comes flopping out of the river , the hat swept away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock of those minutes , another shock registers in their minds . Breasts ! Two orbs swing beneath the hermitite 's shirt as it scrambles up the riverbank on its stubby legs . <p> She is crying , too . " The bridge is gone . " Her hands clasp and unclasp . " The bridge is gone . Oh . " She clutches at her head , her chest , bends to clutch at her knees , even , in a strange protest danced to the river . " Oh , oh , oh , no . The bridge is gone . " <p> The Victrola needle has caught in a groove ; she keeps dancing the same steps to the same rasped words . There is a deep scratch just beneath her right eye , and the blood is beginning to dribble down over her cheek in streaks like Indian war paint . <p> Sheridan and Ruby Ann stare , their arms still around each other . Ruby Ann moves to touch the hermitite 's shoulder . " C'm on , " she says . " The cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drive back to Libertyberg seems shorter now  --  now that their destination is known . Sheridan heads straight for the new Baptist hospital on the edge of town . She is silent , feeling the rough ridges of the accelerator beneath her bare right foot . In the backseat , where the movie camera was , the hermitite giggles softly and then gently sobs , alternating the sounds until Ruby Ann passes her the paper sack of popcorn that Virginia made for them to eat at the drive-in . <p> The only sound for a moment is the crunching of popcorn . Somehow , it is a soothing sound to Sheridan , as if she has captured and tamed all the crickets in the world right in her own backseat . <p> Ruby Ann turns around to face the backseat . " What do you do ? How do you live down there ? " <p> " I fish , " comes the answer , between the noise of chewing .

Virginia and Chester are on either side of her , their faces white and drawn . Sheridan has not seen her mother walk that fast in months . How thin she is !
