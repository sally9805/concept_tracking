txt // player chooses from 18 possible characters ( elf , human , dwarf characters ; the gender can also be chosen ) . The virtuality system is equipped to customize your character ? the person others in the game will see and hear . After all , if you say you are an elf you need to be seen as short and to be heard as speaking in a higher voice . The goal of the game is to live rather than die from foul play or other dangers , succeed in 10 challenges , and defeat the evil master of the dungeon . If this sounds familiar it 's because all-too-familiar knowledges , stories , adventures , and stereotypes operate in virtual reality . The creativity does n't come in the form of new legends . We can expect many more medieval imaginations , cops-and-robbers , sex , and other mayhem from other creators of VR . Legend Quest has been hugely successful . More than 1,500 players signed up for lifetime memberships in the first eight weeks ( at ? 5 each ) . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan strategies and pig roasts ( Delaney , 1993 ) . It seems to me that the potential major change here is some erosion of the classic body/mind split . VR , like all other imaginative situations , has the potential for changes in gender stereotypes , but while , as in other kinds of play-acting , women and men can temporarily change their gender , there is little to suggest major overhauls of those so-called sex roles in VR programming.5 As Brenda Laurel says , the guys who are designing the programs are the guys whose business it is to sell sexual stereotypes , and so the new programs become " another means of enforcing the gender landscape rather than a means of liberation " ( Antonopulos &; Barnett , 1993 , p. 12 ) . Desktop VR For some , desktop virtual reality is a more comfortable , accessible VR system than immersion virtual reality . Some users of current immersion VR suffer from " simulator sickness " because of the sensor lag ? you turn your head but the sensors cause a delay that might disorient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products that are in the design or production stage ; the effects , on the product and its environment , of altering the shape , size , and color can be seen from all angles . For teachers , there are promises of desktop VR programs that will allow them and their students to go places they ca n't or should n't go . For example , a project funded by the Department of Employment and a number of companies in Great Britain allows students at West Denton High School in Newcastle upon Tyne to move around a factory floor with interactive machines that , if real , could be dangerous to the novice operator of lathes . The real and the VR machines are operated // by push-button controls , so the student can learn the safe procedures , such as correct rotation maneuvers , before venturing into the real factory where mistakes could result in problems for the machines and operators . Learning Spanish ? Might be more fun to wander around a VR home , interacting with objects that display their names in Spanish ( Tait , 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its potential is limited only by the imagination of those working on the programs . That 's my worry . I 'm concerned about the limited imagination of those working on and using the programs . And I think we all need to be concerned . Women and Cyberspace Looking at the programs and the discussions of the programs , we see that women are in this cyberspace but in the same basic ways they have been in the rest of men 's technology creations , not as primary decision makers but primarily as tools or concepts to be used in the creations of men . I 'm not discussing here whether women will have their own Virtual Vernon programs to correspond to the sensationally successful ( in terms of copies sold ) Virtual Valerie . Just as there was Playgirl after Playboy and the video game PacWomanTM after PacManTM , there will be a Virtual Vernon after Virtual Valerie . What I 'm concerned about is the place of girls and women in the designing and analyzing of our futures . Given the supposed concern of educational administrators about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our school systems , and given the stated goals of providing meaningful education to students from a variety of backgrounds , we would think that those administrators might be encouraging all manner of studies and providing support to those who are studying the genderizing of the computer studies and programs inside and outside the classrooms . They are not . We can define the problems of access to common electronic programs as occurring at two levels . First , the hardware and software . As anyone who looks with even semi-keen eyes can see , girls and women do not have the access that boys and men have . Studies that indicate that many little boys quickly learn that they can and may push girls off classroom computers should most need the new equipment . The distribution of hardware and software seems to have a direct correlation to the distribution of women and men teachers across the campus . Will we see that biology professors are assumed to need computers but that those teaching nursing classes do not ? Second , there is a problem of access to relevant databases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of on-line discussion groups to // be found via electronic searches , very few of the electronic forums are germane to the feminist student and scholar ( Ebben &; Kramarae , 1993 ) .6 Our own research and our experience in organizing a working colloquium ? Women , Information Technology , and Scholarship ( WITS ) ? at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign makes clear to us that girls and women will have to work , often under difficult circumstances , to alter the trends and to find or create funding for computer equipment and programs and other relevant and useful resources . Judging from what is going on , and not going on , in cyberspace these days , it is vital to all of us that women do this finding and creating . The social critic and speculative fiction writer Marge Piercy gives us some insight as to what might happen to us if we do n't . I suggest that , instead of renting films such as The Lawnmower Man or Terminator 2 from the video shop , you borrow Piercy 's ( 1991 ) He , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old-fashioned way , about the 21st century as she thinks it can be predicted by present events and conditions . In the future that she sees , the environment is , of course , a mess , and the world has been divided into 23 great corporate enclaves . Most people , the day workers and gang ninos and unemployed , live outside the enclaves in the dangerous environment and air of the Glop . Some people live within a wrap in one of the free towns , the choice of those with a minority religion , a sexual orientation not condoned by the multis , or an archaic desire for freedom . The techies of 2061 are , as today , " making those elaborate worlds people play at living in instead of worrying about the one we 're all stuck with " ( p. 7 ) . Food as we know it is very scarce , with most people living on " vat food , " organisms grown in large vats . Spikes , the interactant programs in which the players are projected into the drama , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users just experience what an actor sees , feels , and touches ) ; people tell " of kids found dead who had replayed favorite adventure or porn scenes until they starved to death " ( p. 32 ) . Few people read . The Jewish women in one of the free towns talk about how they have always considered that access to books and various information is part of what they consider human . One woman says , " Most folks press the diodes of stimmies against their temples and experience some twit 's tears and orgasms , while the few plug in and access information on a scale never before available . The many know less and less and the few more and more " ( p. 194 ) . The problem is not with the existence of various technologies ? long ago people became cyborgs in various stages , with artificial knees and hips , kidney and heart transplants , contact lenses , and second skins needed for protec- tion from the sun ; we 're all cyborgs , writes Piercy , who has read Donna Haraway 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 , 431 ) . The problem is partly too much time spent on manufactured fantasies and too little dealing directly with people in their nonprogrammed environments . Piercy is very concerned with past history as well as future , and thus she deals with the ways that minorities , and those majorities who are considered minorities , survive . The women build real-life relationships that give them protection , love , and mental stimulation . Shira , the " shero " of the novel , is also able to experience love with a cyborg man but only because he has been programmed primarily by women . In her acknowledgments , Piercy points out that , given the present realities , her fictional world is not fantasy : Be aware that even now companies are working on sensor nets that permit a person to " walk into " data and experience it as real objects in imaginary space VR . As for the destruction of the ozone layer and the results of global warming , your local library surely has this information , as mine did . ( p. 432 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable place for women . A Time article on " cybertech " states that " what once seemed like a passing fad for preteen boys has grown into a global money making machine that is gobbling up some of the most creative talents in Hollywood and tapping the coffers of media and communications conglomerates eager to get in on the action " ( Elmer-Dewitt , 1993 , p. 68 ; reprinted by permission ) . U.S. manufacturers of video games take in $5.3 billion a year , more than people spend in going to the movies . The several versions of Mortal Kombat are a brutal sensation ( introduced with a $10 million media blitz ) , with lots of digitized blood and gore . Now we have the " almost full-immersion " video " games " with titles such as Comanche Maximum Overkill and Doom . It 's not only what the simulations contain that is of concern ( e.g. , girls and women being threatened or lots of men being killed ) but all the missing characters and topics . Although many people become very concerned about any talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general problem of what is called " entertainment " in this country . The WITS women are very interested in the new technologies and talk about potentials for increasing communication among women , of making child care easier and better for all , and of making their professional lives better rather than more difficult and dangerous . We talk about the importance of being active participants in the learning process and the value of multiple learning modes ( rather than assuming that everyone enjoys learning by waiting for the program to crash ) . We talk about easy access to a broad array of information // ( including such basics as telephone numbers and household information ) and information retrieval customized to one 's personal history ( see Banich &; Wilson , 1993 , p. 67 ) . We are writing and reading essays that deal with the working conditions of women working at cheap rates in other countries to produce the computer parts that have allowed the rapid increased buying of personal computers in the United States . We are asking questions about the impact of technological change for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about social and health issues that come with the new technologies . We are discussing the masculinity of science and what that means for all our work in all disciplines . In general , these are not the issues one sees and hears in " malestream " publications and other forums . Below I mention just a few of the issues I do see discussed in those forums . Men 's talk about VR is at the moment mostly speculative fiction ; I critique that talk via feminist speculative fiction . Ecology Frank Biocca points out that virtual reality " will allow all kinds of protean forms of visual and physical expression without transforming physical reality . . . . It is suggested that virtual reality is a green technology . " Jaron Lanier agrees that " media technology is a minor contributor to the ecological malaise of our planet . . . . To the degree that it might encourage telecommuting that is probably more important than anything else " ( Lanier &; Biocca , 1992 , p. 169 ) . We 'll leave aside the mention of telecommuting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women who try to work two jobs ? working for a company while watching the children , without benefit of union support or day care . What about the argument that VR takes little fossil energy and avoids trampling on the grass ? Some of my friends say that if they had just an hour a week to roam around in their favorite place ? say , the west coast of Oregon , or the Isle of Skye ? that gives them pleasure and stimulation they could then be happier and more productive in the cornfields of Illinois . And some VR advocates point out the values of being able to place people in , for example , the rainforests of the world , to encourage understanding and conservation . Agreed . I 'm waiting for the Oregon coast VR program with inexpensively created waves and smells . However , these programs do use lots of electricity . And we can guess that , as with computers , VR equipment will quickly become antiquated and junked when newer models become available . In addition , I // worry about programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water of the actual places we live in . In many real lives , the man sits at the breakfast table or in his evening chair reading the newspaper while the woman dresses the children , fixes meals , and answers the phone . I can imagine the man of the house putting on his gloves and headset and visiting Costa Rica while the woman of the house stays in the real house , changing the diapers and fixing the meals . I 'd like more discussion of this as we talk about the ecological benefits of VR . Does the interest in moving away from the earth and the environment we 've created come from an interest in moving to a more sanitized world without the messes we 've made ? Sally Gearhart ( 1991 ) , author of the feminist speculative fiction Wanderground : Stories of the Hill Women , has called for " an end to technology , " writing that we are growing more and more dependent on Western science and technology , with the result being that we are virtually helpless when it fails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the many failures of computers that leave consumers stranded in airports and library patrons without a catalogue . More important , in our dependency on technology we stand in an adversarial relationship to our environment . To study and control our environment we alienate ourselves from it , she writes . Technology as it is being used leads to power , domination , and control ? in a failed relationship to our planet . Gearhart ( 1991 ) writes , " An extraterrestrial observing our polluted and diseased planet would have to conclude that homo sapiens , the inventor of technology , was an evolutionary blunder and should now silently ... steal away " ( pp. 83-85 ) . She suggests that if we knew we were to have no more of us we might change our character pretty quickly and quit poisoning , killing , and beating up on each other ( actions that have n't shown much interest in species preservation anyway ) and become more appreciative of our environment . If we ca n't or do n't want a voluntary cessation of reproduction , we have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses so that , for example , we hear and see with more sensitivity and we learn to live much more cooperatively with other animals so as to bring some harmony to all . I 'm watching to see what other animals will appear in VR programs . In the VR literature , I see references to some creatures called " interstellar pukoids " and " nasty phlegm throwers , " but except for a few discussions about rainforest plants and animals , there seems to be little interest in rethinking our relationship with our environment . In fact , the interest seems to be in distancing humans from it , away from the dirt and also away from the pollution we have caused . // Intimacy/Communication Enhancement Rheingold ( 1991 ) writes , The secondary social effects of technosex are potentially revolutionary . If technology enables you to experience erotic frissons or deep physical , social , emotional communication with another person with no possibility of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease , what then of conventional morality , and what of the social rituals and cultural codes that exist solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution and/or the first step toward abandoning our bodies ? . . . perhaps cyberspace is a better place to keep most of the population relatively happy , most of the time ... . Privacy and identity and intimacy will become tightly coupled into something we do n't have a name for yet . ( pp. 352-353 ) This focus on intimacy as technosex is pervasive in VR discussions . For example , during a half-hour program about VR presented on PBS May 1 , 1992 , a speaker on the virtues of VR asked listeners to image the following : You are traveling . You get to the hotel and you miss your wife . You ring up your wife and then you can have sex over the glove/phone link . For many men in particular , heterosexual intimacy means primarily sex , whereas women more often talk about intimacy in terms of general closeness , including sharing thoughts and discussing problems . This conflict of interests is clearly going to be played out once again in the New Media . The alt.sex.news groups on the Internet have very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrequested body parts " visuals " ( e.g. , " breasts " composed of computer keyboard letters and punctuation marks ) e-mailed to women , and digital printouts posted in computer labs as university nets are used to transmit pornography ( Kramarae &; Taylor , 1993 ) . In France , the national fiber-optic Minitel system is largely funded by phone sex ( Stefanac , 1993 ) . Cybersex Now , cyberbabes . We ca n't be surprised , given the current culture and given the real-life creators and manufacturers of the new games , that the New Media develops so clearly and with so little new creativity from the Old . For example , using Interotica 's program NightWatch , the user/voyeur is provided with a VR female guide who points out a number of fantasy possibilities . The guide takes on the behaviors suggested by the player , eventually becoming his personal ideal for this situation . Linda Jacobson , editor of CyberArtr , writes : // Smut on paper or video is much more benign than interactive stroke books . These products show men that they can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bidding and they do it willingly . I am absolutely opposed to censorship , but I think men have to be made aware that this kind of thing can make women feel very uncomfortable . ( quoted in Stefanac , 1993 , p. 41 ) Sex will ( has ? ) become another sport , like hunting and shooting tanks and hostile aliens . Collaborative interaction will likely mean it can be a men 's team sport . It will again be removed from intimacy as many women know or wish it . Brenda Laurel says , " The computer game genre has grown .. . with programmers utterly devoted to an adolescent male demographic and a very white , First World Western view of what 's interesting to kids . . . shooting and killing and blowing things up ... " ( quoted in Bright , 1992 , p. 66 ) . With VR you can also reach out and grab someone . In a passage that 's been reprinted in a number of publications , Rheingold ( 1991 ) writes , Picture yourself a couple of decades hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before you climb into a suitable padded chamber and put on your 3D glasses , you slip into a lightweight ( eventually , one would hope , diaphanous ) bodysuit , something like a body stocking , but with the kind of intimate snugness of a condom . Embedded in the inner surface of the suit , using a technology that does not yet exist , is an array of intelligent sensor-effectors ? a mesh of tiny tactile detectors coupled to vibrators of varying degrees of hardness , hundreds of them per square inch ... . Now , imagine plugging your whole sound-sight-touch telepresence system into the telephone network . You see a lifelike but totally artificial visual representation of your own body and of your partner 's .... Your partner(s) can move independently in the cyberspace and your representations are able to touch each other , even though your physical bodies might be continents apart . ( p. 346 ) But no need to wait the decades . Virtual Valerie exists . It 's not called information but , rather , a game or pornography , depending on whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom or as sexist and exploitive. ? Because she has sold so well , she is one of the best known hut still only one of a number of cyberbabes . Earlier , Valerie 's creator , Mike Saenz , created MacPlaymate for the Mac . He writes that he wanted to create something new : Most games are performance tests ? violent performance tests . Most look as if they 've been programmed by sadistic nerds ? this is largely because they were . I wanted to create a nonviolent interactive simulation that a user could enjoy simply for the experience .... Virtual Valerie . . . she 's your cybernetic fantasy ! .. . // This is our chance to create a whole new form of erotic art .... When I explain virtual reality to the uninitiated , they just do n't get it . But they warm immediately to the idea of virtual sex . . . . I have a silly idea for a product called Strip Teacher . She goes , " Tell me the name of the thirteenth president of the United States and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 , 1992 , pp. 272 , 274 ) I 'll venture that he 's not thinking of this product as primarily an educational experience . Saenz continues , " I think lust motivates technology . The first personal robots , let 's face it , are not going to be bought to bring people drinks " ( quoted in Mondo 2000 , 1992 , p. 275 ) . One multimedia consultant and author writes , Once you start thinking about sex at a distance , it 's amazing how many other questions about future possibilities present themselves , questions about big changes that might be in store for us . Given the rate of development of VR technologies , we do n't have a great deal of time to tackle questions of morality , privacy , personal identity , and even the prospect of a fundamental change in human nature . When the VR revolution really gets rolling , we are likely to be too busy turning into whatever we are turning into to analyze or debate the consequences . ( Rheingold , 1991 , p. 350 ) No time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process goes or whether it goes at all ? Human nature ? What might that be ? That 's a very strange term these days when we are starting to acknowledge and respect many natures , many knowledges , many perspectives . The journal NewMedia states the problem on one cover as " Digital Sex , Technology , Law &; Censorship " with a photo of a nude woman covered only by the words . ( If we want to begin to understand the problem , we can wonder why not a photo of a nude man with genitalia hanging out ? Would that sell as many copies or mean the same ? ) The argument is basically the same as those we 've heard so many times : The First Amendment guarantees each of us free speech . Why , then , is n't there concern about those who do n't have access to free speech and those whose free speech is impeded by the Virtual Valerie programs ? If I made a program that portrayed men in the ways women are portrayed in these programs , I 'd likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a relatively few adults , almost none of whom are women who counter the " malestream " voices . Neither our boys nor our girls are hearing or seeing many choices . And as important , these forms of intimacy come without any necessity or even desirability of giving to another . Piercy ( 1991 ) writes of the simulations of the 21th century : " You watch or rent a stimmie and you enter that actor or // actress . You feel what they feel . They 're yours . But you do n't belong to them . You are freed from the demands of reciprocity " ( p. 382 ) . Another writer comments on this freedom from worries of responsibilities for others : Imagine a cyberspace mate whom you see only when you want to ? one designed to your specifications , who does n't argue , does n't require medical care , never goes away . For some , such a virtual world might be addictive and debilitating . For others , it might be kind . ( Mort , 1992 , p. 191 ) 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 21st century " ( Ulrich , 1992 ) . We can talk about the differing ways of expressing closeness . You 've heard the feminist critiques of men 's ways of expressing intimacy . Men disclose less and mostly about current events , sports , and money ; they think sex is primarily doing rather than being ; they have more but less intimate same-sex friends , and their friendships are based more on activities rather than talking things over . Recently , some communication researchers have pointed out that the research on men 's and women 's friendships has been female biased.9 In focusing on differences we have often overlooked that girls and boys , women and men , all want relationships that are validating and satisfying . Men , the argument continues , have taken a different rather than less meaningful path to closeness . They do things for those about whom they care . Also , they show friendship by sharing activities rather than expressing feelings through talk . Sharing joint activities ( rather than the sharing of information , feelings , and secrets ) is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Through the sharing of activities men have reported that they create feelings of interdependence and affinity and experience personal development ( Swain , 1989 ) . Other critics have suggested that men 's relative unwillingness or disinterest in talking about personal matters means that in intimate interactions with women it becomes very difficult to have discussions about problems . ( Maybe one of the reasons why women are , in general , better at reading nonverbal cues is that they have to learn that when the best man in a woman 's life washes the car he is really saying things like " I understand that you are feeling bad about the death of your cat and the fact that you have an unexplained lump on your elbow and I 'm doing my best to tell you that I am also concerned , that I think that the lump might be caused by the stress that you and I have been under at work . I really care about you and your mental and physical health and I 'm showing it the only way I know how . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What more would you want ? " ) We should talk more about this , however difficult it might be for some . Electronic sex and intimacy , as illustrated and planned in VR , is very limited and limiting . // Community/Shared Dreams and Possibilities Of course , VR can make possible ways of sharing and building an environment together . Not all will be games such as Roger Wilco , which was introduced with questions such as " Who 's the well-oiled androidess pictured on the cover of this issue InterAction , June 1993 , and why is she out to splatter a genetically jumbled Roger ? " 10 We can develop new ways of sharing . Jaron Lanier says , " If virtual reality is used in a way where people using it improvise the content of worlds together , collaboratively , then virtual reality would seem to come closest to providing a kind of shared dream space . " Later , he adds , " Some voomies virtual movies will actually be experiences where people can come in and play dimensional versions of baseball " ( quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Well , that 's one kind of collaboration ? again not highly imaginative . Alternatively , we can imagine that neighbors and city planners could use a VR context to consider what kind of towns we want to create or rebuild . One architect writes about possibilities : Imagine a neighborhood in which transit was within three blocks and ran conveniently every ten minutes .... Imagine that the streets were tree-lined and free of speeding cars ? a neighborhood in which some trips could be made conveniently on foot , transit , or bike ... . The neighborhood would be near a village green with daycare , recreation and a town hall surrounded by homes and fronted on one side by a retail center . . . accessible from the neighborhood and an arterial roadway . This area would contain a library , a post office , professional offices and a transit station . ( Calthorpe , 1993 , pp. 11-13 ) I 'd like to walk around that neighborhood , with my neighbors , trying it out . What about people who are in wheelchairs ? Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women and gay men to walk home at night from the transit station ? What is needed to make it easy to carry or wheel groceries from that retail center ? Theoretically , people of varying ages with varying needs and interests would be able to work out a desirable neighborhood together ? and then work to have some of the features installed in their real neighborhood . Sounds pretty good . Collective , decentralized administration is a feature in many feminist speculative fiction novels . However , as Margarit Eichler ( 1981 ) points out , while the speculative societies in many feminist novels place a greater value on beautifying and equipping public rather than private space , this is the opposite of the real situation we have today . // Unless the creators and marketers of VR programs make some radical changes in what they think important and can convince others to try something new , we wo n't have a lot of neighborly walks . Further , democratic decisions imply equality of human worth and absence of stratification systems ( although individuals might achieve recognized expertise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality is hardly thinkable today . Any simulated neighborhood and any neighborly walk program would have to have educational programs built in to enable us to learn how to walk with an egalitarian gait and talk as if the needs of all members are important , which would necessitate a reevaluation of the social contributions of all peoples . They would be impressive programs . I 'd like to see some initial tries . Given that this society is in the business of more and more traffic congestion , a rapidly deteriorating environment , and more formal and informal segregation , we need some new scenarios badly . I think we have to do a lot of thinking and talking about these issues before VR is going to bring us more community and sharing . Limiting Danger and Hostilities Sex and war are mentioned under this category . The military can test out equipment and operators through VR ; in fact , the military has been a heavy promoter of VR.11 But VR can serve in other ways . Jaron Lanier , former chair of the board and chief scientist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coined the term virtual reality and has obviously done a lot of thinking about the uses of VR and the U.S. culture of the future . He writes , " There 's no doubt that all of us ? and let 's say adolescent boys in particular ? go through a period where they are interested in killing things and aggression . . . . If they do it in a playground , it 's part of a fluid process which continues to grow and change " ( quoted in Lanier &; Biocca , 1992 , p. 164 ) .12 Mike Saenz predicts that " sophisticated sex simulation will be ubiquitous and accepted as legitimate entertainment education and therapy . " He suggests that " just as a flight simulator is used to train pilots before they climb into a real plane , I think sex simulation could be used to prevent unwanted pregnancies and warn about sexually transmitted diseases " ( quoted in Stefanac , 1993 , p. 40 ) . Is this man suggesting that Virtual Valerie be used in the junior high sex ed classes ? Would many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex simulation is to be used as an educational device ? In Marge Piercy 's novel , one of the good features of cyberspace is that people are able to project themselves in the Net the way they think of themselves . The women , for example , can appear as active and strong.13 However , when // we listen to most creators of current programs and to those who will set up the rules and boundaries of what we imagine , we can see that cybersex in general is not going to be about strong and active women . We can imagine dangers and hostilities increasing with the VR programs . Words and Writing in These New , Better Worlds The communication , information , and sensation revolutions and industries have not been designed for , or opened to , women . While many teachers may wonder what will happen to the printed word as words and people become electronic , many of us also wonder just what the exclusion will look like with the new changes . Dale Spender ( in press ) points out that the era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking back now we can see that women were worse off after the introduction of print than they had been before it . And this was n't a case of women deciding that they did n't like the medium , that it was anti-female , or that they did n't want to have anything to do with it . It was a straightforward instance of exclusion . Women were locked out of the powerful information medium for 500 years . It was not until the 1970s , and the establishment of women 's presses in the western world , that women were able to exercise any influence within the medium . It was not until women were the owners of presses , not until they were independent publishers , editors , sales people and booksellers , that women were able to speak in their own voice , and to break through the " sound barrier " in significant numbers . It 's been men and their technologies , with women as their tools . Remember the typewriter ? Initially , the typists were men . Then , as it became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , the typewriter , as the operator was called , became a woman . The telephone was designed and made for men and their businesses ( in some places , " social calls " initially cost more than " business calls " ) , but women were employed to do the switching until new technology took care of most of that . Eventually , computers will be constructed to print the words spoken to them , but for now , many women work in many computer centers tapping away , typing businessmen 's words . In general , women are employed to do what the men do n't want to do and the machines ca n't do yet . Teaching writing with the uses of computers breaks the tradition somewhat because both men and women are learning to type their compositions . However , // if we track the students through universities and into their workplaces , we find that women and men have very different dealings with computers and other machinery . And if we look at the activities of the middle-class girls ltnd boys who will eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with computers . We all know this , of course . We know that it 's primarily the middle-class boys who are spending long hours playing " games " on computers . I think that if we are concerned about our students and what they are learning from us and the rest of the culture , we need to look closely at these differences . We need to consider the changing definitions of sex , gender , intimacy , privacy , and identity and also the remaining gender hierarchy that continues to construct the basis of sex , gender , intimacy , privacy , and identity . The viewers and voyeurs of the New Media perhaps are not fundamentally different in interests and tastes from the viewers and voyeurs of the past and current media . A survey of the BattleTech players found that the players still read newspapers as well as books and magazines ( Pimentel &; Teixerira , 1993 , p. 214 ) . There is an explosion of writing going on the Internet ? " the biggest boom in letter writing since the 18th century : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saffo , 1993 , p. 48 ) . It 's not a matter of whether we 'll use the new technologies ; of course we will as we have access to them . Perhaps VR will not live up to the expectations of its current advocates ; perhaps other entertainment , thought to be closer to " the ultimate experience , " will come along , leaving VR as mostly hype rather than reality . But whatever happens , I think analysis of the gendered work and play of these technologies makes clear that nontraditional forms of expression contain much of the same old ideas about gender roles . Assuming that we think the gender splits and hierarchies of the past , current , and ( unless there are major changes ) the future are destructive , what can we do ? First , we need to pay mind to what 's going on with the activities of millions of young boys and girls . Many working-class children have little access to computers in or outside the classroom ; for many children here and in other countries , life is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic demons on the nets and play all the computer games they can get their hands on ; the girls are not . The reasons for the very different experiences that girls and boys have with the new technologies are many , but all involve the very present gender , race , and class divisions that remain in our culture because those who have the most power to do something basic to alter this situation do n't want to or really do n't know how to . We need to continue to watch , listen , analyze , and make interventions when we can , particularly in times of change . The fake spaces of VR , like the fake spaces of all our imagination and writing , can provide freedoms of various sorts , // but they are designed and constrained by powerful structured forces of assumptions and goals ; they are not equally friendly environments or oppor tunities for everyone . If we want to establish community of any sort , we will continue to want to transcend our own experiences , our own realities . Current VR program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television and movie scripting , is one way to go . The feminist speculative fiction writers show us other ways . Marge Piercy 's work gives us a critique of sci-fi plotting . Joanna Russ , Octavia Butler , Doris Lessing , Suzette Haden Elgin , and Anne McCaffrey are also playing serious games with history and gender assumptions . Ursula Le Guin , in Always Coming Home ( 1984 ) , illustrates a way in which literary genres , music and drawing can combine in culturally rich ways to present alternative ways of thinking , of imagining.14 In sum , how much flexibility everyone has in imagining our selves and our collective future is the real fantastic question . // NEW WORLD TRAVEL WRITING : A DIALOGUE Mary Fuller Henry Jenkins Mary Fuller : We want to start by telling you two stories . Henry Jenkins : Here 's the first . Princess Toadstool is kidnapped by the savage King Koopa . Two brave brothers , Mario and Luigi , depart on a series of adventures to rescue her . Mario and Luigi , simple men of humble beginnings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast unexplored space , encountering strange creatures , struggling against an inhospitable landscape . Finally , they confront and best the monarch and his minions in a life and death struggle . In the process , the Super Mario Brothers not only restore the princess to her people but also exert control over this strange new world and its curious resources . MF : My story is really a collection of stories , which I can probably evoke for you in some form just by mentioning a few key words : Walter Raleigh , Roanoke , the Lost Colony , Virginia Dare . Or Jamestown , John Smith , Pocahontas , John Rolfe . I want to draw for the moment not on the complexities and particularities of these stories but on what is simple and popular , what can be evoked as an indistinct impression : the saleable , inaccurate , recurrent myth of the captive princess and her rescuers ( Virginia Dare , the first child born in what was to become the " Lost Colony " ; Pocahontas , a genuine princess who became a candidate for rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuing John Smith ; Smith himself , both a hero of humble origins and a kind of princess in drag who represented his entire career as a repeated experience of captivity and rescue by women ; or , for that matter , Virginia itself , personified by English apologists for colonization as a virgin to be rescued from savages ) . Nintendo ? ' s Princess Toadstool and Mario Brothers is a cognate version of this story . What we want to get at is not these alluring narratives of Princess Toadstool , Pocahontas , and Virginia Dare ( or of Mario , Luigi , and John Smith ) but another shared 57 // concern in our material that seems to underlie these more memorable fictions in a constitutive way . Both terms of our title evoke explorations and colonizations of space : the physical space navigated , mapped , and mastered by European voyagers and travelers in the 16th and 17th centuries and the fictional , digitally projected space traversed , mapped , and mastered by players of Nintendo ? video games . Simply put , we want to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to motivate is itself the point , the topic , and the goal and that this shift in emphasis from narrativity to geography produces features that make Nintendo ? and New World narratives in some ways strikingly similar to each other and different from many other kinds of texts . HJ : This chapter is the result of a series of conversations we 've been having over the past four years . Our conversations began with hesitant efforts by each of us to understand the other 's area of specialization but have grown in frequency and intensity as we began to locate points of contact between our work . We hope that what follows will reflect the process of that exchange , opening questions for future discussion rather than providing answers for immediate consumption . MF : This work is a confessedly exploratory attempt at charting some possibilities of dialogue and communication between the disparate professional spaces we inhabit . Yet the association between computer software and the Renaissance " discovery " of America is not exactly new . A computer software firm in Boston claims in its advertisement , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day .. . The spirit of exploration is alive at The Computer Merchant " ( Boston Computer Currents , September 1990 , p. 34 ) . More generally , discussions of virtual reality have widely adopted a language borrowed from this earlier era : One headline reads , " THE RUSH IS ON ! COLONIZING CYBERSPACE " ( Mondo 2000 , Summer 1990 , no. 2 , cover ) . HJ : The description and analysis of virtual reality technologies as the opening up of a new frontier , a movement from known to unknown space , responds to our contemporary sense of America as oversettled , overly familiar , and overpopulated . Howard Rheingold 's ( 1991 ) Virtual Reality un-self-consciously mimics the rhetoric of earlier promoters and settlers when he promises to share with his readers the account of " my own odyssey to the outposts of a new scientific frontier . . . and an advanced glimpse of a possible new world in which reality itself might become a manufactured and metered commodity " ( p. 17 ) . Or consider Timothy Leary 's proclamation in that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitless deposits of information which can be digitalized and tapped by the individual equipped with cybergear . . . . There are no limits on virtual reality " ( Rheingold , 1991 , p. 378 ) . Virtual reality opens new spaces for exploration , colonization , and exploitation , returning to a mythic time when there were worlds without limits and resources beyond imagining . Technologists speak of the " navigational systems " necessary to guide us through this uncharted realm . The advent of this new technological sphere meets the needs of a national culture which , as Brenda Laurel suggests , finds contemporary reality " too small for the human imagination " ( quoted in Rheingold , 1991 , p. 391 ) . Few of us have donned goggles and powergloves to become settlers of this new // cyberspace , although both heroic and nightmarish accounts of virtual reality proliferate in popular culture . Many of us have , however , interacted with digitalized space through Nintendo ? games . We felt it might be productive to take seriously for a moment these metaphors of " new worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spatial logic and " cognitive mapping " of video games . MF : One has to wonder why these heroic metaphors of discovery have been adopted by popularizers of the new technologies just as these metaphors are undergoing sustained critique in other areas of the culture , a critique that hardly anyone can be unaware of in the year after the quincentary of Columbus 's first American landfall . When John Barlow ( 1990 ) writes that " Columbus was probably the last person to behold so much usable and unclaimed real estate ( or unreal estate ) as these cybernauts have discovered " ( p. 37 ) , the comparison to cyberspace drains out the materiality of the place Columbus discovered , and the nonvirtual bodies of the pre-Columbian inhabitants who did , in fact , claim it , however unsuccessfully . I would speculate that part of the drive behind the rhetoric of virtual reality as a New World or new frontier is the desire to recreate the Renaissance encounter with America without guilt : This time , if there are others present , they really wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters ) , or if they are , they will be other players like ourselves , whose bodies are not jeopardized by the virtual weapons we wield . The prospect of seeing VR as a revisionary reenactment of earlier history raises issues that we address only in passing : One would be the ethics and consequences of such a historical revision ; another would be to ask whether it is accurate to say that VR is unlike Renaissance discovery in having no victims , that at no point does it register harmfully on real bodies that are not the bodies of its users . These kinds of questions frame our discussion , which has a narrower focus on the specificities of Nintendo ? games and voyage narratives as rhetorical and cultural artifacts . If the simple celebration of expansiveness borrowed from the age of discovery for virtual reality no longer seems adequate to the texts and experiences it once described , it seems no less important to map the narrative and rhetorical configurations of these texts themselves , which have provided model and metaphor for so much later experience , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " ancestral murderers and poets " ( p. 79 ) . The kinds of New World documents I have in mind are ones like Columbus 's Diario ( 1492-1493 ) or Walter Raleigh 's Discoverie of the large , rich and beautiful empire of Guiana ( 1596 ) or John Smith 's True Relation of such occurrences and accidents of noate as hath hapned in Virginia ( 1608 ) ? that is , chronologically structured narratives of voyage and exploration , from ships ' logs to more elaborate texts . At the outset , one might expect these narratives of travel to and return from what was at least conceptually another world to assume a different kind of structure than , in fact , they do : a romance or quest motif , the ironic contrasts of utopian fiction , or at least an overt " theme . " Such expectations are largely disappointed . One literary critic complains that the travel journal underwent no sustained development as a literary form but conforms more or less consistently to a formulaic pattern : " The abstract reads , we sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saved or lost , made such and such encounters with the savages , hungered , thirsted , and were storm worn , but some // among us came home " ( Page , 1973 , p. 37 ) . Part of the problem lies outside the texts , in that practical strategies embedded in the material diverge from the demands of narrative coherence : the same critic complains that the carefully prepared climax of Jacques Cartier 's Brief Recit is spoiled when Cartier decides to sail for home instead of waiting for a long anticipated Indian attack . Reading the voyage narratives from the perspective of conventional narrative expectations is an experience of almost unremitting frustration . Yet these texts , if they are not conventional narratives , are equally clearly not transparent records of an experience that itself demands no commentary . On the contrary . And so one wants first to find a way of characterizing their structure and its shaping imperatives on its own terms and second , to account for their reception , their uses and pleasures for audiences then and now . This is material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hakluyt , one of the founding members of the Virginia Company , made a lasting name for himself by collecting and publishing documents of voyages by his contemporaries , documents ranging the gamut of possibilities from ethnographic survey to narrative poem to navigational instructions . Hakluyt 's first collection appeared in 1582 as a slim quarto volume . By 1601 , the third and final collection , The Principal Navigations . . . of the English Nation , took up three large folio volumes totaling almost 900 pages ( 12 volumes in the modem edition ) . Hakluyt 's work was continued by Samuel Purchas , whose Hakluytus Posthumus , appearing in 1625 , had expanded to 4,262 pages . Simply on the basis of volume , these documents would impose themselves on our attention , whatever their narrative shape . H.1 : Nintendo ? , similarly , plays an increasingly visible role with the American imagination . By the end of 1990 , one of three homes in the United States owned a Nintendo ? system . My household was one of them , and I wanted to know more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural artifacts , as popular narratives , and as a new media for mass communication . As I discovered when asked to review two recent books on Nintendo ? ( Kinder , 1991 ; Provenzo , 1991 ; see Jenkins , 1993 ) , current accounts lack any serious discussion of the particularity of Nintendo ? as a means of organizing cultural experience ; the writers fail to address what it meant to be playing the games rather than watching or reading them . Both books seemed interested in talking about Nintendo ? for other reasons : in one case in terms of issues of pedagogy , in the other in terms of issues of intertextuality , but both offered accounts that presuppose that traditional narrative theory ( be it literary or film theory ) can account for our experience of Nintendo ? in terms of plots and characters . This application of conventional models to an emergent form seemed unsatisfying because it ignores the way that game players discuss the experience of play and the ways that the games are marketed to their consumers . Plot is not a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about interactivity rather than characterization ( " Nintendo ? gives you power to choose " ) and about atmospheres rather than story lines ( " awesome graphics " ) . Nintendo ? , a 100-year-old playing card company little known outside Japan , revitalized the declining American video game market by // moving from the simple , abstracted spaces of Pong or Pac-ManTM to create an ever changing and visually fascinating arena for play . Nintendo ? ' s central feature is its constant presentation of spectacular spaces ( or " worlds , " to use the game parlance ) . Its landscapes dwarf characters who serve , in turn , primarily as vehicles for players to move through these remarkable places . Once immersed in playing , we do n't really care whether we rescue Princess Toadstool or not ; all that matters is staying alive long enough to move between levels , to see what spectacle awaits us on the next screen . Mario 's journey may take him by raft across a river of red hot molten lava , may require him to jump from platform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his way through a subterranean cavern as its ceiling collapses around him . The protagonist of a sword and sorcery game may struggle against a stormy sea , battle a massive serpent , confront a pack of wolves who rule a frozen wasteland , or combat an army of the dead that erupt from the trembling earth , all in search of lost fortunes and buried gold . A game like Lemmings puts us in charge of an army of tiny creatures , willing slaves who live and die at our bidding and who dig tunnels or construct bridges to allow us to continue to venture deeper into the game space . For the most part , the technological limitations of the game systems mean that we move left to right through this space , but designers may simulate other kinds of movement , such as an elevator in the Ninja Turtles ? game that allows us to battle our way higher and higher into Shredder 's command center or racing games that allow us to skim forward along a winding racetrack getting closer and closer to the glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Nintendo ? system allows for multiple levels of graphics that interact with each other in ever more complex fashions . The art of game design comes in constructing a multitude of different ways we can interact with these visually remarkable spaces . Most of the criteria by which we might judge a classically constructed narrative fall by the wayside when we look at these games as storytelling systems . In Nintendo ? ' s narratives , characters play a minimal role , displaying traits that are largely capacities for action : fighting skills , modes of transportation , preestablished goals . The game 's dependence on characters ( Ninja Turtles , Bart Simpson , etc. ) borrowed from other media allows them to simply evoke those characters rather than to fully develop them . The character is little more than a cursor that mediates the player 's relationship to the story world . Activity drains away the characters ' strength , as measured by an ever shifting graph at the top of the screen , but it can not build character , since these figures lack even the most minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere ? a haunted house , a subterranean cavern , a futuristic cityscape , an icy wilderness ? that the player can explore . This process becomes most visible when we look at games adapted from existing films or television programs ; here , moments in the narrative trajectory become places in the player 's itinerary , laid out as a succession of worlds we must travel through in order to reach our goals . Playing time unfolds in a fixed and arbitrary fashion with no responsiveness to the psychological time of the characters , sometimes flowing too slow to facilitate player interest and blocking the advance of the plot action , other times moving so fast that // we ca n't react quickly enough to new situations or the clock runs out before we complete our goals . Exposition occurs primarily at the introduction and closing of games : For instance , the opening of Super Mario World ' " reminds us that the Princess has once again been kidnapped . The game 's conclusion displays the reunion of Princess and champion and a kind of victory tour over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " canned " : Players can not control or intervene in them . Often , a player simply flashes past this exposition to get into the heart of the action . These framing stories with their often arbitrary narrative goals play little role in the actual experience of the games , as plot gives way quickly to a more flexible period of spatial exploration . Although plot structures ( kidnapping and rescue , pursuit and capture , street fighting , invasion and defense ) are highly repetitive ( repeated from game to game and over and over within the game , with little variety ) , what never loses its interest is the promise of moving into the next space , of mastering these worlds and making them your own playground . So although the child 's play is framed by narrative logic , it remains largely uncontrolled by plot dictates . The pleasure of spatial spectacle may be most visible in games that do not seem to require anything more than the most rudimentary spaces . Street Fighter IITM , one of the most popular Nintendo ? games in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been staged in any arena . The game , however , offers players a global array of possible spaces where the individual competitions can occur : a Brazilian dock , an Indian temple , a Chinese street market , a Soviet factory , a Las Vegas show palace . In the Indian sequence , elephants sway their trunks in the background . Water drips from the ceiling into a Japanese reflecting pool . In Spain , flamenco dancers strut and crowds cheer as the combatants struggle for dominance . All of these details constitute a form of visual excess ( " eye candy , " as computer enthusiasts call it ) , a conspicuous consumption of space . Such spectacular visions are difficult to program , unnecessary to the competition , yet seem central to the game 's marketing success . MF : It sounds to me as if not only space but culture is being consumed , used and also used up as local cultures from India to Las Vegas shrink into a procession of ornamental images . Each is " colorful , " yet none is really alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Renaissance travel narratives : The same image might begin its career as close observation at first hand and reappear in progressively more stylized and ornamental forms detached from its original reference , as John White 's drawings of North Carolina Algonquians reappeared on the engraved frontispiece to Theodor de Bry 's America and were , in turn , reproduced as illustrations for John Smith 's adventures in Virginia . One might also think of the famous Rouen entry of Henri II , where an entire Tupi village was recreated , employed for a day or so as a place for the performance of Brazilian life , and then burned . If Nintendo ? feeds the appetite for encountering a succession of new spaces ( as well as helping to create such an appetite ) , that same appetite was , of course , central to these New World narratives . In turn , there were pressures on texts to conform to a locodescriptive form , the equivalent in writing of Nintendo ? ' s scrolling succession of spaces . One precursor of the travel narrative would be the logbook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for date , time , compass bearing , wind , speed , and , finally , notes . The logbook presents a succession of indexed spaces on the page that correspond to a succession of days and places . Implicitly , each of these spaces is of equal importance : The grid predisposes its user to make some notes in each space but not too many . Athough the logbook was a technical tool of long-distance navigation , its form strongly influenced land-based narratives that followed arrival . As an instance of a locodescriptive project both in action and writing , John Smith 's strategy of successively exploring and mapping all the rivers around Jamestown contrasted with the Virginia Company 's desire to impose grander , more recognizable , and more goal-oriented trajectories on the travels of the colonists : to find a gold mine , a passage to China , or Raleigh 's Lost Colony . These ultimate objectives , held as in suspension , enabled Smith 's presence in Virginia and his day-by-day progress through the natural and human geography of the Chesapeake . This configuration , of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as we suggested at the outset ) a common one in this material . Voyages and narratives that set out in search of a significant , motivating goal had a strong tendency to defer it , replacing arrival at that goal ( and the consequent shift to another kind of activity ) with a particularized account of the travel itself and what was seen and done . Hernan Cortes ( 1986 ) walked into Tenochtitlan in 1534 , becoming master of its gold and other resources ; yet the bulk of his Second and Third Letters concerns not this period of achieved conquest and consumption but the survey of points on the way there and then a second survey of points passed through on the drive to reconquer the city through more conventional military means . Even goal-driven narratives like those of Raleigh or Columbus at best offered only dubious signs of proximity in place of arrival ? at China , El Dorado , the town of the Amazons ? phenomena that , interpreted , erroneously suggested it was just over the horizon , to be deferred to some later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narratives , which aim not only to describe but to persuade . That is , Walter Raleigh wanted to find El Dorado , and he also wanted to produce a narrative that would stimulate interest in Guiana and persuade Elizabeth to restore him to favor . The imperative that operates on his text in consequence is less that of coherence than of completeness , a ( doubtless , loaded ) inventory of what was done and seen , one that provided at once both an alternate , more diffuse kind of justification for the discovery and motives and informational resources for a repeat performance . Ralph Lane , one of the Roanoke Colony 's governors , noted that the particularity of his account is " to the end it may appear to you . . . that there wanted no great good will . . . to have perfected this discovery " ? of a rumored mine the company never set out towards ( Lane , 1979 , p. 309 ) . Even in the Discoverie of Guiana , a text whose teleology is announced in the title , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something , get lost in a welter of details , of events and places that have little to do with El Dorado but that occupied the days of the voyage . The sequenced inventories of places and events replace , defer , and attest to an authentic and exculpating desire for goals the voyages almost invariably failed to reach . // Given the inconclusiveness I 've described , it was the ability to move in space ( rather than to arrive ) that generated and structured narrative ; John Smith wrote primarily about the times he was in motion , not the times he was sitting in Jamestown . The resulting narratives were , in turn , organized by elapsed time ( sequences of dates ) but also determined by it . Henry mentioned that " characters " in Nintendo ? can be described less in terms of learning and transformation than in terms of resources gradually expended in the course of the game . This sense of a trajectory dictated not by change or crisis but by expenditure , the gradual running out of a fixed quantity of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives I study because it was an equally frequent phenomenon in the voyages and colonial experiments they document . Many documents record the consequences of poorly managing resources ? the season for sailing passing as one sits windbound in an English harbor , a crew mutinying at the idea of sailing beyond Ireland , food running out in the middle of the winter or the middle of the ocean ( this one over and over ) , having to write home hypothetical accounts of the treasures you would discover if you had better boats or more food or it were not so late in the year . These documents end not because some resolution or conclusion has been achieved but because something has run out . To give another example , John Smith 's ability to trade for corn to feed a starving colony was unarguably more critical than the story about the rescue of the Lost Colony that the Virginia Company tried to impose on him or the story about Pocahontas that he recounted 16 years after the event and 6 years after her death . HJ : Although we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is , in fact , a precedent for them in Michel De Certeau 's work in successive books on New World discourse ( Heterologies , 1984a ) and on the politics of consumption in contemporary popular culture ( The Practice of Everyday Life , 1984b ) . While we are claiming space as the organizing principle for two kinds of narrative , as what makes them different from novels , for example , De Certeau ( 1984b ) lays out a grand claim for spatial relations as the central organizing principle of all narratives : " Every story is a travel story ? a spatial practice " ( p. 115 ) . Our cultural need for narrative can be linked to our search for believable , memorable , and primitive spaces , and stories are told to account for our current possession or desire for territory . De Certeau 's analysis of " spatial stories " provides tools for talking about classes of narratives that have proven difficult to discuss in terms of traditional notions of plot or character . Consider , for example , the emergence of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of creating imaginary spaces for our intellectual exploration . The adventure stories of Jules Verne drew upon centuries of travel writing as they recounted a variety of trips to the moon , under the sea , into the center of the earth , or around the globe . The technological utopian writers often created static plots ( a man from our present goes to the future ) that allowed them simply to describe the landscape of tomorrow ; one can draw a direct line from the moment in Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward , where the book 's protagonist stands on his balcony and surveys Boston 's future , to the train cars that allowed visitors to the 1939 New York World 's Fair to ride above and look down upon Futurama . Hugo Gernsback 's Amazing Stories magazine was full of chronicles of " odysseys " across // the uncharted wilderness of Mars or Venus and encounters along the way with strange flora and fauna . Writers often modeled these aliens ' worlds after the American West so that they could cross-market their stories to both western and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slow to develop in this genre that seemed so obsessed with going " where no one has gone before . " A similar claim could be made for various forms of fantasy writing . Trips to Oz or Narnia or through the looking glass , adventures in Middle Earth , or quests for the Grail all seem to center as much on the movement of characters through space as on the larger plot goals that motivate and give shape to those movements . Maps appear in fantasy novels with the same frequency and function that genealogies appear in the great 19th-century novels , suggesting the relative stress the two forms give to spatial relations and character relations . It is not surprising that science fiction , fantasy , and sword-and-sorcery stories provide much of the iconography of the Nintendo ? games . Nintendo ? may also be linked to another class of spatial stories , the amusement park rides that as early as turn-of-the-century Coney Island adopted popular fictions into spaces we can visit and explore . Walt Disney 's Peter Pan becomes a ride by flying ship across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runaway mine car tour , and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is remade into a submarine ride . The introduction of virtual reality technology to the Orlando , Florida , amusement parks results in a succession of ever more intense " tours " of the stars , the oceans , the human body , the World of Hanna-Barbera , and the dawn of time . Nintendo ? ' s constant adaptation of plot-centered contemporary films into spatial narratives represents a miniaturization of this same process . The tamed frontier of the virtual new world has , from the first , been sold to us as a playground for our world-weary imagination , as a site of tourism and recreation rather than labor and production . Public interest in virtual reality is directly linked to the amusement park 's long history of satisfying popular demand for spatial difference , spectacular attractions , affective stimulation , and sensual simulation . De Certeau 's description of Jules Verne 's stories as focused around the related images of the Nautilus 's porthole ( a windowpane that " allows us to see " ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through " fantastic realms ) has its obvious parallels in these amusement park attractions that invite us to look upon and travel through but not to touch these spectacular spaces ( De Certeau , 1984b , p. 112 ) . What is a spectacle at the amusement park ( " Keep your hands in the car at all times " ) becomes a site of more immediate interaction in the Nintendo ? game that asks us to act upon and transform the places it opens to our vision . MF : Voyage narratives were almost never presented as recreative texts , whatever they might become for later readers . Two exceptions are Richard Willes 's Historie of travel ( London , 1577 ) and Andre Thevet 's Les singularitez de la France antarctique ( Paris , 1558 ) . Although a narrative like Thomas Harriot 's Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia ( London , 1588 ) might offer a catalogue of America 's abundant flora and fauna , the items of the catalogue were presented not as strange things to wonder at but as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // potential for industrious activity . Leisure in the New World was pejoratively characterized as idleness , associated with disease , mendacity , and social disorder . In most places the English settled , colonists had to do some work to feed and shelter themselves ; when a company shipwrecked on the uninhabited Bermudas and found an Edenic land of temperate weather and dreamlike abundance , its leaders found means to take the company back to starvation in Jamestown . The project of colonizing itself was , in the English case , less a matter of acquiring a native workforce than of finding work for what contemporaries envisioned as the teeming masses of England 's unemployed . Virginia 's colonists were there ( at least in theory ) to labor , not to look , and labor was directed to activating the commercial potentials of the land . HJ : For De Certeau ( 1984b ) , narrative involves the transformation of place into space ( pp. 117-118 ) . Places exist only in the abstract , as potential sites for narrative action , as locations that have not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the potential contained as bytes in the Nintendo ? game cartridge or the potential resources coveted but not yet possessed in the American New World . Places constitute a " stability " which must be disrupted in order for stories to unfold . Places are there but do not yet matter , much as the New World existed , was geographically present , and culturally functioning well before it became the center of European ambitions or the site of New World narratives . Places become meaningful only as they come into contact with narrative agents ( and in the construction of the New World in Mary 's Renaissance stories , only Europeans are understood as narrative agents ) . Spaces , on the other hand , are places that have been acted upon , explored , colonized . Spaces become the location of narrative events . As I play a Nintendo ? game and master it level by level , I realize the potentials encoded in the software design and turn it into the landscape of my own saga . The place-space distinction is closely linked to De Certeau 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours " as means of representing real-world geographies . Maps are abstracted accounts of spatial relations ( " the girl 's room is next to the kitchen " ) , whereas tours are told from the point of view of the traveler/narrator ( " You turn right and come into the living room " ) ( De Certeau , 1984b , pp. 118-122 ) . Maps document places ; tours describe movements through spaces . The rhetoric of the tour thus contains within it attention to the effects of the tour , its goals and potentials , its limitations and obligations . A door is a feature of a place , or it may be a potential threshold between two spaces . One of my favorite games , A Boy and His Blob , places the resources of its imaginary world fully at our disposal . The blob can be transformed into everything from a blowtorch to a stepladder depending on what flavored jellybean we feed him , and as a result , the mutating blob contains endless possibilities for acting upon and transforming the virtual playing space . The pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunneling down deeper and deeper into its cavernous world . The blob , the various levels , the jellybeans exist as potentials that only become narratively meaningful when we act upon them and bring them into our control . De Certeau is thus interested in analyzing and documenting the process by which we " mark off boundaries " within the narrative world , by which characters map , act // upon , and gain control over narrative spaces . Just as narratives involve movement from stability through instability and back again , narratives also involve a constant transformation of unfamiliar places into familiar spaces . Stories , he argues , are centrally concerned with " the relationship between the frontier and the bridge , that is , between a ( legitimate ) space and its ( alien ) exteriority " ( De Certeau , 1984b , p. 126 ) . He continues : " The story endlessly marks out frontiers . It multiplies them , but in terms of interactions among characters ? things , animals , human beings " ( De Certeau , 1984b , p. 126 ) . Plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and displacement of space , a struggle for possession and control over the frontier or journeys across the bridges that link two spaces together . Such terms will , of course , be familiar to anyone who has thought about the discovery and colonization of America . Yet Nintendo ? also enacts a constant struggle along the lines that separate known and unknown spaces ? the line of the frontier ? which is where the player encounters dangerous creatures and brutal savages , where we fight for possession and control over the story world . As De Certeau ( 1984b ) notes , the central narrative question posed by a frontier is " to whom does it belong ? " ( p. 127 ) . The frontier here is apt to be technological and urban rather than primitive and pastoral ( or , as in the Mario Brothers games , a strange mix of the two ) but then Mary 's settlers were also mapping their adventures on spaces already occupied by someone else 's culture . The frontier line is literalized through the breakdown of story space into a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . One must push toward the edge of the screen to bring more space into view . The games also often create a series of goalposts that not only marks our progress through the game space but also determines our dominance over it . Once you 've mastered a particular space , moved past its goalpost , you can reassume play at that point no matter the outcome of a particular round . These mechanisms help us to map our growing mastery over the game world , our conquest of its virtual real estate . Even in the absence of such a mechanism , increased understanding of the geography , biology , and physics of the different worlds makes it easy to return quickly to the same spot and move further into the frontier . A related feature of the games are warp zones ? secret passages that , like De Certeau 's bridges , accelerate one 's movement through the narrative geography and bring two or more worlds together . Knowledge about warp zones , passwords , and other game secrets are key items of social exchange between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become important aspects of the economic exchange between game companies and players . Nintendo ? engages in a playful yet lucrative form of " insider trading , " selling secret tips about traversing the game space to consumers either through 1-900 hotlines or through subscriptions to Nintendo ? Power magazine , which markets detailed maps of the many worlds and levels of popular games and tips for coping with the local flora and fauna or crossing difficult terrain . The maps and charts that Nintendo ? Power publishes are curious documents . Strictly speaking , they are not maps at all , not abstract representations of geographic places . The magazine simply unfolds the information contained on many different screens as a continuous image that shows us the narrative space from the player 's // point of view , more or less as it will be experienced in the game . ( The closest analogy would be something like Japanese scroll painting . ) Surrounding these successive representations of the screen space is a narration or " tour " that identifies features of the landscape and their potentials for narrative action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island 3 : " Lush jungle regions dominate Stage 2 . However , a remote island to the southwest appears to be snowed under . How unusual ! One of the largest waterfalls known to mankind will be encountered in Stage 2 . Its cascading torrents may be too much for the loin-clothed island hero . To the south , Higgins will be lost in the mist " . The text may also suggest possible ways of acting upon this space and point toward the forms of resources and knowledge needed to survive there : " The Spiders should n't give Higgins too much trouble . Some move up and down and some of them do n't . There may be hidden Eggs in places such as this . " At times , the text may also focus our attention back onto the larger narrative context , onto character disputes or goals that frame the game action : " The volcanos are erupting ! Higgins had better act fast so he can rescue his girlfriend and get out of there . Because of the tremendous heat , the supply of fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision making . The aliens , astonished that Higgins made it this far , will be waiting ! " ( " Adventure Island 3 , " Nintendo ? Power , October 1992 , no. 41 , pp. 8-13 ) Such representations of virtual space bear close resemblance to De Certeau 's description of early maps that " included only the rectilinear marking out of itineraries ( performative indications chiefly concerning pilgrimages ) , along with the stops one was to make ( cities which one was to pass through , spend the night in , pray at , etc. ) and distances calculated in hours or in days , that is , in terms of the time it would take to cover them on foot . Each of these maps is a memorandum prescribing actions " ( De Certeau , 1984b , p. 120 ) . Much like these earlier maps , the Nintendo ? documentation focuses on the specific narrative actions to be performed upon these spaces , purposes to be pursued and sites to be visited , rather than a universalized account of the possible places that exist independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , however , the game company withholds crucial information , and the final stage of the game remains unmapped and undocumented . Players must still venture into an unfamiliar and uncharted space to confront unknown perils if they wish to master the game . MF : As Henry 's citation from De Certeau suggests , we might locate Nintendo ? ' s treatment of space in relation to a history of cartography . The Renaissance was , in fact , the moment when mapmaking shifted from providing locally oriented maps of previous trajectories and observations by coastal navigators ( rutters ) to the universalized overview of the Mercator projection . Yet the " universalized overview " was still conceptual rather than actual ; the information needed to map the globe was still being gathered in arenas of intense competition and secrecy . I 've suggested that the particularized accounts of travel offered by narratives like Smith 's or Raleigh 's more or less deliberately replaced arrival with the details of travel as a process . These details , of course , were not only substitutive but also served practical purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the voyages . Printed books like Richard Hakluyt 's collection of voyage narratives or // Smith 's General History were routinely carried by ships on voyages of trade and settlement . Observing this weight given to narratives , one might describe a shift in the center of value from things to be discovered to information about the terrain covered en route . When Hakluyt describes the capture of the Portuguese carrack Madre de Deus in 1592 , among its spins was a 1590 treatise on China in Latin , found " enclosed in a case of sweet cedar-wood , and lapped up almost an hundred fold in fine calicut-cloth , as though it had been some incomparable jewel " ( Hakluyt , 1598-1600 , vol. 2 , p. 88 ) . Information itself becomes the priceless commodity . J. B. Harley ( 1988 ) links the censorship of cartographic information in early modern Europe to the economic transformations that accompanied the beginnings of overseas empires . In a period when the foundations of the European world economy and its overseas empires were being laid , absolute monarchs were also " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolies opened up by their navigations . As in the case of the nation-state , the essence of empire is control . For such corn- mercial monopolies to survive and for the policies of mare clausum to be implemented , there had to be a monopoly of the knowledge that enabled the new lands and the routes to and from them to be mapped . ( Harley , 1988 , p. 61 ) Christopher Columbus and John Smith withheld information on true distance traveled from the rest of their parties ; Francis Drake was restrained from making charts or descriptions of his voyage , and his narrative was held back from publication for eight years . Raleigh 's ( 1848 ) Discoverie broods over the impossibility of keeping any new knowledge secret , an impossibility that justifies his decision not to explore a potential gold mine : I thought it best not to hover thereabouts , least if the same had been perceived by the company , there would haue bin by this time many barks and ships set out , and perchance other nations would also have gotten of ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been prevented , and all our care taken for good vsage of the people been vtterly lost . ( pp. 59-60 ) Information itself became a valued commodity to be accumulated , withheld from circulation , and given out strategically . HJ : When I watch my son playing Nintendo ? , I watch him play the part of an explorer and a colonist , taking a harsh new world and bringing it under his symbolic control , and that story is strangely familiar . De Certeau reminds us that one traditional function of narratives is to define a people 's relation to their spaces , to justify their claims upon a certain geography . Cultures endlessly repeat the narratives of their founding as a way of justifying their occupation of space . What is interesting about Nintendo ? is that it allows people to enact through play an older narrative that can no longer be enacted in reality ? a // constant struggle for possession of desirable spaces , the ever shifting and unstable frontier between controlled and uncontrolled space , the need to venture onto unmapped terrain and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . For children , Nintendo ? further offers the image of personal autonomy and bodily control that contrasts with their own subordinate position in the social formation . MF : The notion of simulating this early colonial experience was not born with Nintendo ? . The Victorian editor Edward Arber ( 1885 ) writes in his preface to The Three Earliest English Books on America that in them One is able . . . to look out on the New world as its Discoverers and first explorers looked upon it . Nowadays , this Globe has but few geographical mysteries ; and it is losing its romance as fast as it is losing its wild beasts . In the following texts , however , the Wonderment of its Discovery in all its freshness , is preserved , as in amber , for all time . ( p. v ) And if late 19th-century editions of American voyage narratives offered readers like Virginia Woolf a vicarious experience , America in the 16th and 17th centuries famously offered to the unlanded or disenfranchised youth of England an alternate arena of possible advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advertised in some documents as a place where a young man 's hands could be his lands , offering unique opportunities for social and economic mobility , America at other moments offers to England a place where potentially subversive elements ? heterodox ministers or " masterless men " ? can be sent , where the backbreaking labor that subdues the body will necessarily lead to a conformity of the exhausted spirit . The theory contemporaneous with the voyage , as well as the writings of colonists , represents America ambiguously as a place of acquiring mastery and of being mastered . The time-honored representation of the English voyages has been a confident , masculine " thrust outwards " and expansion of , among other things , an enlightened English rule . The prestige that the voyages retrospectively acquired under Victoria was solidified by accounts that linked territorial expansion to the flowering of literary achievement represented , especially , by Shakespeare ( also Marlowe , Sidney , and others ) . In contrast to this celebratory reception , the mastery of children playing Nintendo ? is valued only within restricted circles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . But if , as we argue , Nintendo ? plays out in virtual space the same narrative of mastering new territory that these earlier texts repeatedly record , it has also been argued that Renaissance England was preoccupied with its own littleness , insularity , and triviality ( Knapp , 1993 ) . It also seems to be the case that most of England 's early voyages and settlements were characterized less by mastery and success than by forms of incompetence , failure , and incomprehension . It is difficult to locate unambiguously in these narratives either what is masterful , prestigious , and monumental or what is trivial , disgraceful , and subordinate . Although our two subjects have acquired different cultural meanings , they are in // important ways fundamentally the same narrative , the same kind of experience , one real , the other simulated . HJ : Our purpose in talking about Nintendo ? next to these older texts is not to make a claim about direct causal links between the two traditions nor to borrow cultural authority for Nintendo ? by brushing it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods minimally allows us to think more creatively about forms of narrative that privilege space over characterization or plot development not as aberrations or failures to conform to aesthetic norms but as part of an alternative tradition of " spatial stories , " a different way of organizing narratives that must be examined and evaluated according to their own cultural logic . Because all ways of organizing narratives presuppose ways of organizing social and cultural experience , there are ideological implications as well in seeing Nintendo ? games as sharing a logic of spatial exploration and conquest with these earlier works . Nintendo ? not only allows players to identify with the founding myths of the American nation but to restage them , to bring them into the sphere of direct social experience . If ideology is at work in Nintendo ? games ( and rather obviously , it is ) , ideology works not through character identification but , rather , through role playing . Nintendo ? takes children and their own needs to master their social space and turns them into virtual colonists driven by a desire to master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a specific role in relation to the economic and cultural imperialism of Renaissance Europe , Nintendo ? games must also be positioned against the backdrop of a new and more complicated phase of economic and cultural imperialism . Critical theorists have often oversimplified this issue : American-based multinationals dump their cultural goods on the rest of the world , producing an international culture that erases indigenous cultural traditions . In this scenario , cultural power flows in one direction , from the West to the East ? terms that provide a sharp reminder of how present a Renaissance geography still is , reaching Japan by traveling east , locating direction in relationship to the Old World and not the New . Nintendo ? ' s success complicates a unidirectional model , suggesting ways that the appropriation and rewriting of these cultural goods may become an alternative source of cultural and economic power . Nintendo ? ' s much disputed bid to purchase the Seattle Mariners represented a public acknowledgment of the increasingly central role of Japanese popular culture in defining how Americans play . Japan 's longtime adaption , appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell its cultural goods in the American marketplace , much as in another age British pop stars ruled the American music scene . What exactly is the cultural status of a Nintendo ? game , based partially on American generic traditions or adopted from specific Western texts , drawing some of its most compelling iconography from Japanese graphic art , licensed by Japanese corporations , manufactured and designed by corporations in both the Americas and Asia , and for sale to both Japanese and American marketplaces ? What are the lines of economic and cultural influence when we see Bugs Bunny , Hulk Hogan , and Bart Simpson existing side by side with samurai , sumo wrestlers , and Mecha-men ? Does Nintendo ? ' s recycling of the myth of the American New World , combined with its // own indigenous myths of global conquest and empire building , represent Asia 's absorption of our national imaginary , or does it participate in a dialogic relationship with the West , an intermixing of different cultural traditions that insures their broader circulation and consumption ? In this new rediscovery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonist ? // OF SOFTWARE : COMPUTER GAMES AND INTERACTIVE TEXTUALITY Ted Friedman Contemporary theories of literature and film have worked hard to " liberate the reader " from the shackles of authorial intent and textual determinism ( see , e.g. , Allen , 1992 ; Fish , 1980 ; Freund , 1987 ; Tompkins , 1980 ) . Today , it practically goes without saying within the discourse of cultural theory that no text exists until it is engaged by a subject ? that textuality is always an interactive , creative process . But while critics in the humanities have grown more and more bold in proclaiming the reader 's power over the images on a printed page or celluloid strip , few have paid much attention to the emergence of new media that call into question the very categories of author , reader , and text . ( An important exception is the pioneering work of David Myers , to which I refer throughout this chapter . ) Interactive software ? computer games , hypertext , and even " desktop " programs and databases ? connect the oppositions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading " and " writing , " together in feedback loops that make it impossible to distinguish precisely where one begins and the other ends . Recognizing a reader 's changing expectations and reactions as a linear text unfolds is one thing , but how do we talk about textual interactions in which every response provokes instantaneous changes in the text itself , leading to a new response , and so on ? The answer is not very clear yet , for whereas the humanities have theoretical accounts to explain the workings of literature , film , and television , as yet there is no " software theory . " 73 // Hypertext : A Limited Paradigm The one form of interactive computer texts that has been explored in some depth by cultural theorists is hypertext ( see , e.g. , Barrett , 1989 ; Delany &; Landow , 1991 ; Landow , 1992 ) . Hypertext is software that allows many different texts to be linked , so that simply clicking a mouse on a key word brings up a new related document . It can be used to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnotes that do not simply supply page numbers but instantaneously call up whole documents , each of which in turn can be linked to other documents . But emphasizing hypertext as the model for interactive computer texts traps software theory in traditional notions of textuality . The hypertext reader simply navigates through a network of choices , like a person flipping around in a book by consulting the index . Certainly , the possibility that this book may be thousands of pages and part of a series of thousands of volumes opens up incredible opportunities . But however great the database , the hypertext reader 's choices are still limited by the finite number of links created by the hypertext author or authors . The constant feedback between player and computer in a computer game is a far more complex interaction than this simple networking model . And computers ' graphics and sound capabilities along with joystick and point-and-click interfaces make reading an even more tenuous analogy . Whereas in one stage of development , computer games like Infocom 's Zork series may have simply been " interactive fiction " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today often need little or no written text at all . This does not mean that computer game playing is a transparent activity ? far from it , as any hapless Nintendo ? novice can attest . Rather , like becoming teleliterate , learning how to play computer games is a process of learning a distinct semiotic structure . To some extent , this language , like that of classical Hollywood narrative , carries over from one text to the next ; initiates can finish one game and comfortably move on to the next one , particularly if they remain in the same genre . But in some ways , every new computer game is its own world , a distinct semiotic system , and it is the very process of learning ( or conquering ) that system that drives interest in the game . Every game typically requires a " learning curve " while the user grows familiar with the new interface and the logic of the program . It is when the game 's processes appear transparent , when the player can easily win the game , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitional genre particularly appealing to literary academia because it dresses up traditional literary study with postmodern // multimedia flash . Concentrating on an account of hypertext to explain interactive computer texts is like basing film studies on the genre of screenplays without looking at the movies themselves ; what is needed is an analysis rooted in the distinct qualities of this new kind of interaction between viewer and text . Computer Games If we wish to move beyond familiar paradigms and look at software that has developed truly new forms of reader-text interaction , it seems clear to me the place to start is computer games . Playing games on computers was first made possible by the introduction of minicomputers in the late 1950s . Freed from the IBM punch card bureaucracy , programmers for the first time were able to explore the possibilities opened up by hands-on interaction with computers . Games were among the first programs attempted by the original " hackers , " undergraduate members of MIT 's Tech Model Railroad Club . The result , in 1962 , was the collaborative development of the first computer game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asteroids arcade game , played on a $120,000 DEC PDP-1 ( Laurel , 1993 ; Levy , 1984 ; Wilson , 1992 ) . Computer designer Brenda Laurel ( 1993 ) points out this early recognition of the centrality of computer games as models of human-computer interaction : Why was Spacewar the " natural " thing to build with this new technology ? Why not a pie chart or an automated kaleidoscope or a desktop ? Its designers identified action as the key ingredient and conceived Spacewar as a game that could provide a good balance between thinking and doing for its players . They regarded the computer as a machine naturally suited for representing things that you could see , control , and play with . Its interesting potential lay not in its ability to perform calculations but in its capacity to represent action in which humans could participate . ( p. 1 ) As computers became more accessible to university researchers throughout the 1960s , several genres of computer games emerged . Chess programs sophisticated enough to defeat humans were developed . The first computer role-playing game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By typing short phrases the player could communicate commands to the computer to manipulate a character through various settings and solve puzzles . Then in 1970 , Scientific American columnist Martin Gardner introduced Americans to LIFE , a simulation of cellular growth patterns written by British mathematician John Conway that became the first " software toy , " an addictively // open-ended model of systemic development designed to be endlessly tinkered with and enjoyed ( Levy , 1984 ; Wilson , 1992 ) . The 1970s , of course , saw the birth of the video arcade , the home video game system , and the personal computer . By the early 1980s , computer game software production had become an industry ( Wilson , 1992 ) . And in the past 10 years , as personal computers ' capacities have rapidly expanded , computer games have continued to develop , offering increasingly detailed graphics and sounds , growing opportunities for multiple-player interaction via modems and on-line services , and ever more sophisticated simulation algorithms . According to the magazine Computer Gaming World , as of 1992 about 4,000 computer games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain games ( Wilson , 1992 ) . These products range from arcadestyle games emphasizing hand-eye coordination , to role-playing games adding graphics and sound to the Adventure formula , to simulation games in which players oversee the growth and development of systems ranging from cities to galaxies to alternate life-forms . CGW divides the contemporary field into seven genres : action/arcade , adventure , role-playing adventure , simulation , sports , strategy , and war . Within these categories , of course , there is much overlap . An empire-building game like Civilization ' , for example , rests somewhere between a war game and a simulation , and many adventure games contain arcade-style interludes ( see Myers , 1989 , for a more extensive discussion of computer game genres ) . The Computer Gaming Subculture Of course , academia 's neglect of computer games hardly means that games have gone untheorized . Among the people who design and play computer games , the poetics and possibilities of computer games have been a subject of continuous discussion . Computer Gaming World is the self-conscious organ of the computer game industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips , and periodic essays on the state of computer games . It takes its role as the connection between the hard-core computer game market and the computer game industry very seriously . It thoroughly covers the computer game industry and publishes abstracts from technical programming essays in the Journal of Computer Game Design . Every issue also ranks the Top 100 current games and Top 10 in each genre , based on continuous reader polling ( each issue contains a ballot card ) . This interaction with readers continues not only through the mail but on-line as well . The Prodigy ? service runs a daily column by the editors of CGW , and the editors regularly scan the gaming forum and respond to bulletins posted there . // The intense dialogue fostered by CGW and other forums within the computer gaming industry and subculture has led to the formulation of a computer game canon ( a Hall of Fame printed in every issue of CGW and archived on Prodigy ? ) and several provisional theories of computer gaming . These discussions are , to my mind , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games as " Interactive Cinema " One prominent strand of thought within the computer gaming subculture is to describe the computer game industry as the " New Hollywood . " ' This analogy has its roots in the changing economics of entertainment production . Over the past few years , Hollywood studios have flocked to Silicon Valley to gain access to the latest computer-generated special effects techniques and to position themselves to be able to produce the kind of interactive entertainment to come in the 500-channel future . The " New Hollywood " analogy serves as a helpful model for understanding the process of computer game design . Although in the industry 's infancy it was possible for one programmer to write and market a game single-handedly , today computer game production is a complex , collaborative process among many specialists . The introduction screens for contemporary games read like movie credits , listing producers , programmers , artists , musicians , and even , in the newer games with digitized images and recorded dialogue , actors . At the top of the credits are the designers , the equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Ultima ? ' s Lord British , King 's Quest ? ' s Roberta Williams , and SimCity " s Will Wright are respected as artists with unique personal visions . The difference between the New Hollywood and the Old , according to the analogy , is that computer games are " interactive cinema , " in which the game player takes on the role of the protagonist . This model particularly fits adventure games such as Sierra On-Line 's Leisure Suit Larry ' ' and King 's Quest ? series . And with the development of CD-ROM technology , the fit seems even closer : Much more data can now be stored on disk than ever before , so that what the game player sees and hears approaches movie quality . The newest CD-ROM games replace the traditional on-screen text with audio dialogue , often recorded by well-known actors . On the CD-ROM version of Star Trek ? : The 25th AnniversaryTM , for example , the dialogue is spoken by the actual Star Trek ? cast . It is not impossible to imagine the day when a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production values may have vastly improved since the days of text-based " interactive fiction , " the problem that designers of contemporary " interactive cinema " face remains the same : how to define " interactive " ? How can one give the player a sense of " control " over the game while still propelling the player through a compelling narrative ? The solution , dating back to Adventure and Zork , has always been to set up the game as a series of puzzles . The player must muddle through the universe of the game ? exploring the settings , talking to the characters , acquiring and using objects ? until she or he has accomplished everything necessary to trigger the next stage of the plot . In the process , the player is expected to regularly make mistakes , die , and restart the game in a previously saved position . ( The film Groundhog Day perfectly captures this " Oh no , not again ! " exasperation . ) The flaws in this system have prompted the development of a cottage industry offering hint books , 1-900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their adventures . The idea of computer " role playing " emphasizes the opportunity for the gamer to identify with the character on the screen ? the fantasy is that rather than just watching the protagonist one can actually be her or him . But whereas classical Hollywood cinema is designed in every way to allow one to " lose oneself ' in the fantasy on-screen , the stop-and-go nature of the puzzle-solving paradigm makes it very hard to establish the same level of psychic investment . Although adventure games can be a lot of fun , even the best of them can not really deliver what they promise . As Computer Gaming World 's adventure/ role-playing game columnist Scorpia complained in 1992 , There is an increasing undercurrent of dissatisfaction among game-players . Yes , the pictures are beautiful , the music is orchestral-quality , the interface simple and easy to use , but when the game is finished , there is n't so much feeling of satisfaction with it . Rather , one has the impression that the game was only a vehicle for displaying the virtuosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option in designing " interactive cinema " is to make the game more like hypertext : Rather than railroading the player through a predetermined story line , the game could simply present a series of choices , each branching out into new possibilities , like the children 's book series Choose Your Own Adventure . Up until now , this approach has rarely been attempted in computer games , probably for economic reasons : It did not seem practical to create scenes and characters the player may never get around to seeing . A notable exception was Infocom 's unsuccessful late-1980s Infocomics series ( Wilson , 1992 ) . Now that CD-ROMs open up the opportunity for far more data to be available in a game , it appears that this possibility is beginning to be // explored again . The publicity for the most recent edition in the King 's Quest ? series , King 's Quest VP , emphasizes that " every choice you make affects your future options and the attitudes and actions of characters you encounter . Depending on your skills and the decisions you make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nearly half of the possible events optional " ( " News Notes , " 1993 , p. 16 ) . But a hypertext model of " interactive cinema " still does little to give the player a sense of real autonomy ; the choices remain a limited set of predefined options.2 This certainly increases the complexity of the game : The linear narrative becomes a web , giving the gamer the opportunity to explore the ramifications of various options and map out the game 's network of forking paths . But whether a single plot or a network of choices , the world of the game remains as predetermined as that of any film or novel . All of this is not to say that computer gaming is inherently a more distanced , alienating form of interaction than watching a movie ? far from it , as we shall see . But , ironically , those games modeled upon cinema are likely to be the least involving . Hamstrung by the demands of traditional narrative , these games operate under a limited model of computer interaction as a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to take advantage of the opportunities for constant interaction and feedback between player and computer in the way that other forms of computer games can . As science fiction writer and computer game critic Orson Scott Card ( 1991 a ) argues , What every good game author eventually has to learn ... is that computers are a completely different medium , and great computer artworks will only come about when we stop judging computer games by standards developed for other media .... You want to do the rebuilding of Atlanta after the war ? SimCity does it better than either the book or the movie of Gone With the Wind . The computer " do n't know nothin ' ' bout birthin ' babies , " but what it does well , it does better than any other medium that ever existed . ( p. 54 ; reprinted by permission of Compute , ? 1991 , Compute Publications International , Ltd . ) SimCity : The " Software Toy " Ideal The game to which Card refers , SimCity ? , is a simulation that allows the player to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of SimCity ? demonstrates the surprisingly compelling power of a particular kind of human-computer interaction very different from either hypertext or " interactive cinema . " // SimCity ? actually did not start off as a simulation game . As the game 's creator , Will Wright , explains , SimCity evolved from Raid on Bungling Bay , where the basic premise was that you flew around and bombed islands . The game included an island generator , and I noticed after a while that I was having more fun building islands than blowing them up . About the same time , I also came across the work of Jay Forrester , one of the first people to ever model a city on a computer for social-sciences purposes . Using his theories , I adapted and expanded the Bungling Bay island generator , and SimCity evolved from there . ( quoted in Reeder , 1992 , p. 26 ) Nervous that the product Wright came up with would appear too " educational , " distributors Broderbund took extra steps on SimCity ? ' s release in 1987 to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster " options and prepackaged scenarios ? earthquakes , nuclear meltdowns , even an attack from Godzilla . But as a 1989 Newsweek article on the game pointed out , such add-ons were " excess baggage " ( Barol , 1989 , p. 64 ) . What turned SimCity ? into a giant software hit , spawning numerous bootlegs , imitations , and spin-offs ( including SimEarth ? , SimAnt , SimLife , SimFarmTM , SimHealth , and most recently the sequel/update SimCity 2000 'm ) , was the pleasure Wright discovered in the simulation process itself . A description of the original game comes from a Maxis catalog : SimCity makes you Mayor and City Planner , and dares you to design and build the city of your dreams . . . . Depending on your choices and design skills , Simulated Citizens ( Sims ) will move in and build homes , hospitals , churches , stores and factories , or move out in search of a better life elsewhere . ( Maxis Software Toys Catalog , 1992 , p. 4 ) Beginning ( in the basic scenario ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund , the player constructs a city by choosing where and what kind of power plants to build , zoning industrial , commercial , and residential areas , laying down roads , mass transit , and power lines , and building police stations , fire departments , and eventually airports , seaports , and stadiums , and so on . Although playing the game eventually comes to feel entirely intuitive , the system is quite complex , and the sequel SimCity 2000 ' offers even more options . Every action is assigned a price , and the player can only spend as much money as he or she has in the city treasury . The treasury begins at a base amount and can be replenished yearly by taxes , the rate of which is determined by the player . As the player becomes more familiar with the system , she or he gradually develops strategies to encourage economic growth , build // up the population of the city , and score a higher " approval rating " from the Sims . Which of these or other goals the player chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxis likes to refer to its products as " software toys " rather than games and insists , When you play with our toys , you set your own goals and decide for yourself when you 've reached them . The fun and challenge of playing with our toys lies in exploring the worlds you create out of your own imagination . You 're rewarded for creativity , experimentation , and understanding , with a healthy , thriving universe to call your own . ( Maxis Software Toys Catalog , 1992 , p. 10 ) Expanding on the " software toy " ideal , Card ( 1991b ) argues that the best computer games are those that provide the most open-ended frameworks to allow players the opportunity to create their own worlds : Someone at every game design company should have a full-time job of saying , " Why are n't we letting the player decide that ? " . . . When designers let . . . unnecessary limitations creep into a game , gamewrights reveal that they do n't yet understand their own art . They 've chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they snatch back with their left hand the freedom they offered us with their right . Remember , gamewrights , the power and beauty of the art of gamemaking is that you and the player collaborate to create the final story . Every freedom that you can give to the player is an artistic victory . And every needless boundary in your game should feel to you like failure . ( p. 58 ; reprinted by permission of Compute , ? 1991 , Compute International , Ltd . ) Computer Gaming as Demystification Of course , however much " freedom " computer game designers grant players , any simulation will be rooted in a set of baseline assumptions . SimCity ? has been criticized from both the left and the right for its economic model . It assumes that low taxes will encourage growth while high taxes will hasten recessions . It discourages nuclear power while rewarding investment in mass transit . And most fundamentally , it rests on the empiricist , technophilic fantasy that the complex dynamics of city development can be abstracted , quantified , simulated , and micromanaged.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its founding principles . They can be engaged and debated , and other computer games can be written following different principles . But there could never be an " objective " simulation free from " bias " ; computer programs , like all texts , will always be ideological constructions . // The fear of some computer game critics , though , is that technology may mask the constructedness of any simulation . Science fiction writer and Byte magazine columnist Jerry Pournelle ( 1990 ) argues , The simulation is pretty convincing ? and that 's the problem , because ... it 's a simulation of the designer 's theories , not of reality . . . . My point is not to condemn these programs . Instead , I want to warn against their misuse . For all too many , computers retain an air of mystery , and there 's a strong temptation to believe what the little machines tell us . " But that 's what the computer says " is a pretty strong argument in some circles . The fact is , though , the computer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the programmers told it to tell you . Simulation programs and games can be valuable tools to better understanding , but we 'd better be aware of their limits . ( on-line from Nexus ) Pournelle 's warnings are well taken , but I think he overestimates the mystifying power of technophilia . In fact , I would argue that computer games reveal their own constructedness to a much greater extent than more traditional texts . Pournelle asks that designers open up their programs so that gamers can " know what the inner relationships are . " But this is exactly what the process of computer game playing reveals . Learning and winning ( or , in the case of a noncompetitive " software toy , " " reaching one 's goals at " ) a computer game is a process of demystification : One succeeds by discovering how the software is put together . The player molds his or her strategy through trial-and-error experimentation to see " what works " ? which actions are rewarded and which are punished . Likewise , the extensive discourse on game strategy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Official SimCity Planning Commission Handbook and The SimEarth Bible does exactly what Pournelle asks , exposing the " inner relationships " of the simulation to help players succeed more fully . Unlike a book or film that one is likely to encounter only once , a computer game is usually played over and over . The moment it is no longer interesting is the moment when all its secrets have been discovered , its limitations exposed . Game designer and author Chris Crawford ( 1986 ) describes the hermeneutics of computer games as fundamentally a process of deconstruction rather than simple interpretation . David Myers ( 1990a ) observes , " According to Crawford , the best measure of the success of a game is that the player learns the principles behind that game while discovering inevitable flaws in its design . . . . A game should lift the player up to higher levels of understanding ' " ( p. 27 , quote from Crawford , 1986 , p. 16 ) . // Simulation and Subjectivity Playing Sim City ? is a very different experience from playing an adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human and computer is constant and intense . Game playing is a continuous flow ? it can be very hard to stop because the player is always in the middle of dozens of different projects : nurturing a new residential zone in one corner of the map , building an airport in another , saving up money to buy a new power plant , monitoring the crime rate in a particularly troubled neighborhood , and so on . Meanwhile , the city is continually changing , as the simulation inexorably chugs forward from one month to the next ( unless the player puts the game on pause to handle a crisis ) . By the time the player has made a complete pass through the city , a whole new batch of problems and opportunities have developed . If the pace of the city 's development is moving too fast to keep up with , the simulation can be slowed down ( i.e. , it will wait longer in real time to move from one month to the next ) ; if the player is waiting around for things to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , it is easy to slide into a routine with absolutely no downtime , no interruptions from complete communion with the computer . The game can grow so absorbing , in fact , that players ' subjective sense of time is distorted ( see Myers , 1992 ) . Myers ( 1991 ) writes , " From personal experience and interviews with other players , I can say it is very common to play these games for eight or more hours without pause , usually through the entire first night of purchase " ( p. 343 ) . You look up , and all of a sudden it is morning . It is very hard to describe what it feels like when one is " lost " inside a computer game precisely because at that moment one 's sense of self has been fundamentally transformed . Flowing through a continuous series of decisions made almost automatically , hardly aware of the passage of time , the player forms a symbiotic circuit with the computer , a version of the cyborgian consciousness described by Donna Haraway ( 1985 ) in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel like an organic extension of one 's consciousness , and the player may feel like an extension of the computer itself . This is n't exactly the way the SimCity ? user 's manual puts it . The manual describes the player 's role as a " combination Mayor and City Planner . " In Civilization ' , the player is referred to as " Chief , " " Warlord , " " Prince , " " King , " or " Emperor " ( depending on the skill level ) and can adopt the names of various historical leaders ? Abraham Lincoln when playing the Americans , Genghis Khan when leading the Mongols , and so on . But while these titles suggest that the gamer imagines her- or himself playing a specific " role " along the lines of the " interactive cinema " model , the structures of // identification in simulation games are much more complex . Closer to the truth is the setup in Populous , where the player is simply God ? omnipotent ( within the rules of the game ) , omniscient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , like Hidden Agenda and Crisis in the Kremlin , the player 's power and perspective is limited to that of a chief of state , in games like SimCity ? the player is personally responsible for far more than any one leader ? or even an entire government ? could ever manage . The player directly controls the city 's budget , economic and residential growth , transportation , police and fire services , zoning , and even entertainment ( the Sims eventually get mad if you do n't build them a stadium ) . While each function is putatively within the province of government control , the game structure makes the player identify as much with the roles of industrialist , merchant , real estate agent , and citizen as with those of Mayor or City Planner . For example , in SimCity ? , the way a new area of town is developed is to " zone " it . The player decides whether each parcel of land should be marked for residential , industrial , or commercial use . The player can not make the zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the simulation on the basis of a range of interconnected factors including crime rate , pollution , economic conditions , power supply , and the accessibility of other zones . If the player has set up conditions right , an empty residential zone will quickly blossom into a high-rise apartment complex , raising land values , adding tax money to the city 's coffers , and increasing the population of the city . If the zone is n't well-integrated into the city , it may stay undeveloped or degenerate into a crime-ridden slum . Although the player can not control the behavior putatively assigned to the residents of the city ? the Sims ? the identification process at the moment the player zones the city goes beyond simply seeing oneself as " the Mayor " or even as the collective zoning commission . The cost of zoning eats up a substantial portion of a city 's budget ? much more than it would cost a real city . This is structurally necessary to limit the player 's ability to develop the city , so that building the city is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact ) . The effect on game play is to see the process less as " zoning " than as buying the land . This is not to say that the gamer considers every building as owned by the government , but at the moment of zoning , the gamer is playing the role not of mayor but of someone else ? homeowner , landlord , or real estate developer , perhaps , in the case of a residential zone . One could see playing SimCity ? , then , as a constant shifting of identificatory positions , depending on whether one is buying land , organizing the police force , paving the roads , or whatever . This , I think , is part of what 's going on . But this model suggests a level of disjunction jumping back and // forth from one role to the next ? belied by the smooth , almost trancelike state of game play . Overarching these functional shifts , I think , is a more general state of identification : with the city as a whole , as a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not go to the root of the process because " the city " in question is a very different object from , say , the city of New York . Except for those cases when gamers choose to recreate real cities , no outside referent exists for the world on the computer screen . And while the game visuals are cleverly iconic ? tiny little houses , factories , and mini-malls ? they hardly evoke any " real " space the way a movie set or even a written passage can . It is unlikely , I think , that the player in the thick of the game takes the time to look at a residential district and imagine a " real life " city block . Rather , for the gamer , the city exists in its own right , a substitute for nothing else ? a quintessentially postmodern " simulation " in Baudrillard 's ( 1983 ) sense , as " real " as any other representation and divorced from any need for a " real world " referent . In this case , attempting to map " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . When a player " zones " a land area , he or she is identifying less with a " role " ? Mayor , industrialist , or whatever ? than with a process . And the reason why the decision , and the continuous series of decisions the gamer makes , can be made so quickly and intuitively is that the gamer has internalized the logic of the program , so that the gamer is always able to anticipate the results of his or her actions . " Losing oneself " in a computer game means , in a sense , identifying with the simulation itself . Simulation as Cognitive Mapping In The Condition of Postmodernity , David Harvey ( 1989 ) argues for the primacy of spatialization in constructing cognitive frameworks : " We learn our ways of thinking and conceptualizing from active grappling with the spatializations of the written word , the study and production of maps , graphs , diagrams , photographs , models , paintings , mathematical symbols , and the like " ( p. 206 ) . He then points out the dilemma of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate are such modes of thought and such conceptions in the face of the flow of human experience and strong processes of social change ? On the other side of the coin , how can spatializations in general ... represent flux and change ? " ( p. 206 ) . Representing flux and change is exactly what a simulation can do , by replacing the stasis of two- or threedimensional spatial models with a map that shifts over time to reflect change . And this change is not simply the one-way communication of a series of still // images but a continually interactive process . Computer simulations bring the tools of narrative to mapmaking , allowing the individual not simply to observe structures but to become experientially immersed in their logic . Simulations may be our best opportunity to create what Fredric Jameson ( 1991 ) calls " an aesthetic of cognitive mapping : a pedagogical political culture which seeks to endow the individual subject with some new heightened sense of its place in the global system " ( p. 54 ) . Playing a simulation means becoming engrossed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . The simulation acts as a kind of map-in-time , visually and viscerally ( as the player internalizes the game 's logic ) demonstrating the repercussions and interrelatedness of many different social decisions . Escaping the prisonhouse of language that seems so inadequate for holding together the disparate strands that construct postmodern subjectivity , computer simulations provide a radically new quasi-narrative form through which to communicate structures of interconnection . Sergei Eisenstein hoped that the technology of montage could make it possible to film Das Kapital . But the narrative techniques of Hollywood cinema developed in a way that directs the viewer to respond to individuals rather than abstract concepts . A computer game based on Das Kapital , on the other hand , is easy to imagine . As Chris Crawford notes ( paraphrased by David Myers ) , " Game personalities are not as important as game processes ? ' You can interact with a process . . . . Ultimately , you can learn about it " ' ( Myers , 1990a , p. 27 , quote from Crawford , 1986 , p. 15 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of simulation games like SimCity ? is that they are solipsistic " power trips , " gratifying the gamer 's desire to play God . This is to some degree unfair ? simulations are often played in groups , particularly in educational settings . ( SimCity ? is used as a pedagogical tool in many urban studies classes . ) But it is true that the absorbing interaction between human and computer in simulation gaming tends to discourage collaborative play . Adventure games , by comparison , have always been more conducive to collaborative playing because of the stop-and-go nature of the game play . When you can not get any further in a game until you solve a puzzle , the more minds the better . Nonetheless , even the computer " role playing " adventures spun off from the Dungeons &; Dragons ? universe have always been designed primarily for solitaire play . ( Theoretically , up to six players could each control a different character , but in practice there is very little for individual characters to do . ) In part , this has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substitute for interpersonal interaction ? if you ca n't find anyone to play D &D; with , the computer may be the next best thing . But it has also been the result of technical limitations . The bottom line has always been that when there is only one keyboard and one mouse , only one player at a time can actually interact with the computer . Only arcade games have actually developed interfaces to allow simultaneous play on a single set . With the proliferation of modems and the growth of the Internet and other on-line services , all this is beginning to change . Sierra 's ImagiNation , for example , allows players from across the country to join together to play both traditional games like chess and bridge , and a D &D-style; role-playing adventure , The Shadow of Yserbius . How on-line interactivity will affect computer game development is hard to tell . Will the accessibility of human opponents make computer-generated opponents obsolete ? Could it be possible to design an on-line simulation game that transcends the solitaire model , combining intense human-computer interactivity with computer-mediated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book , just something that has to be done alone ? These questions about a bunch of games may seem peripheral to the Big Issues rolling down the Information Highway . But we should remember that the first program the MIT hackers wrote on their new PDP-1 was Spacewar . Today , as we experiment with ways to better communicate on the Internet , many of the tropes of adventure gaming are being borrowed by new virtual spaces . The first " MUD , " short for " Multi-User Dungeon , " was invented in 1979 as an open-ended on-line fantasy world that role players could not only explore but help build by creating new objects and rooms ( Rheingold , 1993 , p. 151 ) . Today , MUDs include not only Tolkeinesque lands and Star Trek ? - based galaxies but also communities like MediaMOO , a virtual version of MIT 's Media Laboratory where media researchers can get together for " virtual drinks " or attend panels in virtual ballrooms . The basic commands invented for text-based adventures ? " move , " " look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and so on ? provide visitors with a range of interactive opportunities . And the computer game traditions of thick textual description , playful role-playing , and persistent exploration remain powerful imaginative tools at MediaMOO for opening up computer-mediated communication beyond simply " chatting " in real time . As data capacities increase and text-based virtual communities expand to include sound and graphics , it is likely that computer games will continue to have things to teach us about interacting both with software and with each other . Computer games , after all , are where we go to play with the future . // Notes I. This widely quoted phrase was coined by Electronic Arts executive Trip Hawkins in the early 1980s ( Wilson , 1992 ) . This version of " interactive cinema " is the most obvious possible application of computer gaming to Hollywood product as new interactive cable technology is introduced . It is the logical extension of the practice of filming multiple endings to show to test audiences . What better way to please everybody than to give each viewer the choice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , to limit our notions of interactivity to this fixed-choice model ? one that computers merely facilitate rather than make possible ? is to fail to recognize the unique possibilities for interaction offered by computers . Perhaps a more exciting variation on the Hollywood scenario would be to give the viewer access to all the shot footage of a program , so that the viewer ( with the facilitation of a computer interface ) could choose how to edit it into a narrative . In this way , rather than being limited to a predetermined set of choices the viewer could have a sense of creative control . Complaining about the pro-government " bias " of SimHealth , a new game simulating the economics of health care reform , one critic speculates , " Maybe what we really need is an economic simulator called SimAdam Smith : You turn it on and just leave it alone " ( Moss , 1994 ) . As we shall see , however , it is not a simple step to equate the gamer with the hand of government , even if she or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON USENET Margaret L. McLaughlin Kerry K. Osborne Christine B. Smith A globe-spanning web of computer networks offers millions of users the opportunity to exchange electronic mail , transfer files , search databases , and retrieve information from remote libraries , take part in real-time conferences , run software on distant computers , and participate in discussion groups on topics from autism education to yacht design . Subscribers to these networks represent an eclectic mix of universities , government agencies , and commercial concerns , with the latter constituting the fastest growing user domain ( Lazzareschi , 1993a ) . One of the largest networks in this web is the Internet ( Arick , 1993 ; December , 1993 ; Electronic Frontier Foundation , 1993 ; Hardie &; Neou , 1993 ; Krol , 1992 ; LaQuey , 1993 ; Rafaeli , Sudweeks , &; McLaughlin , in press ) . The growth of the Internet has been explosive in recent years and is likely to continue , given reports that communications industry giants Time-Warner and Tele-Communications are actively moving to bring Internet access and services to their millions of customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 300,000 of its current subscribers by the end of 1994 ( Lazzareschi , 1993b ) , and Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . is reportedly acquiring Delphi Internet Services ( Flanigan , 1993 ) . Access to the Internet is currently offered by CompuServe and other proprietary on-line services . So addictive has network access become to recent college graduates that at least one observer has characterized the Internet as the MTV of the so-called Generation X ( Herz , 1993 ) . 90 // The accelerating privatization of the net , as exemplified by the recent agreements between MCI and a consortium of regional networks , the active courtship of the cable companies by the regional Bells ? most prominently the proposed acquisition of Tele-Communications by Bell Atlantic ? and the construction of high-speed fiber-optic networks all suggest that the dream of a seamless , gigabit-speed network may be realized in the very near future , bringing vast communications resources to homes and businesses as well as to the traditional consumers in the educational and scientific communities . Accompanying the revolution in communications will be an array of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The global reach of the Internet not only facilitates communication among members of existing distributed groups and teams but , perhaps more important , provides a medium for the formation and cultivation of new relationships by providing virtually instantaneous access to thousands of potential contacts who have compatible interests and spheres of expertise . Besides providing a hospitable environment for a host of new forms of relating ranging from long-distance gaming ( Curtis , 1992 ) to remote collaboration ( Carley &; Wendt , 1991 ; Frederick , 1993 ) , one of the major attractions of the Internet is that its users can turn to its many " newsgroups , " or electronic bulletin boards , to ask for advice on researching their Irish ancestors or to express their opinions about the single life , to argue about Derrida or exchange references on Drosophilia , to compare notes on the soaps and the Simpsons ( Baym , 1992 ) , or to connect to others with compatible sexual tastes ( Penkoff , in press ) . These bulletin boards , many of which are distributed through the Usenet store-and-forward network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from communications media as traditionally understood , combining as they do aspects of both mass and interpersonal communication . Usenet is a network of an estimated 75,000 computers that exchange " news " articles posted to more than 5,000 newsgroups ( B. Reid , 1993c ) . Although many of the Usenet sites exchange articles via UUCP ( O'Reilly &; Todino , 1992 ) or Fidonet , Usenet traffic today is largely generated and carried on the Internet . Usenet is widely available not only at universities , libraries , government agencies and high-tech businesses but is also accessible through commercial entities such as Netcom , America Online , and GEnie , which are gatewayed into the Internet . An estimated 11 million users worldwide read , post , and/or reply to articles on topics ranging from Unix wizardry to recreational folk dancing ( B. Reid , 1993c ) . Usenet news is available in read-only mode for walk-in traffic at many libraries , and available evidence suggests that , in fact , reading , or " lurking , " as it is called , is the principal mode of participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993c , 1993d ) for most people who have access to it . // Convenient interactive participation in Usenet is available to persons who have accounts on systems running " newsreader " software . The most sophisticated newsreaders ( Wohler , 1993 ) organize the news by groups , by topic and subtopic , into a menu-driven user interface that makes it possible to select articles to read , save , reply to , or forward to others . Newsreaders may be customized to exclude groups , topics , or authors of no interest to the reader . Reply functions serve to organize posted messages with common subject headings into " threads " that create and sustain the topical macrostructure of the newsgroup 's ongoing discussion . Topical continuity is enhanced by " reply including " features that allow responses to threads ( called follow-ons ) to include edited or unedited text of previous messages . Besides making contributions to ongoing threads , readers may initiate new topics as well . Many groups prepare FAQs that provide answers to " Frequently Asked Questions " and acquaint newcomers with newsgroup practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Reid 's data ( 1993a , 1993b , 1993c , 1993d ) would seem to indicate that , at least for the most popular newsgroups , the ratio of readers to posters of messages on Usenet is extremely high . A comparison may be made between these readers and readers of newspapers and magazines in that a relatively minuscule number " post " responses to news items . While acknowledging that letters to the magazine or newspaper editor may create a fleeting sense of community , MacKinnon ( 1992 ) short-circuits further comparison by noting that this " emergent dialogue is not a dialogue at all , but a set of coincident monologues . . . possibly staged ? selected ? by the editor to represent a diversity of views " ( p. 14 ) . According to MacKinnon , newsgroup postings , by virtue of their spontaneity and uncensored state , are more representative of true dialogue . In his view , the frequency and regularity of contributions by a proportion of newsgroup readers further distinguishes this form of social interaction as a more stable and enduring aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community fostered by mass consumption of dialogue produced by a relative few . Silent readers may feel that they are a part of the conversation ; however , this vicarious participation raises the spectre of pseudocommunity . Beniger ( 1987 ) argues that pseudocommunity represents the " reversal of a centuries-old trend from organic community ? based on interpersonal relationships ? to impersonal associations integrated by mass means " ( p. 369 ) . Even MacKinnon ( 1992 ) is careful to stipulate that on-line interactions are // conducted by " personae " and that the actions and feelings expressed may not be mirrored either physically or symbolically by their creators . This prompts Rheingold 's ( 1993a ) concern : Individuals find friends and groups find shared identities on-line , through the aggregated networks of relationships and commitments that make any community possible . But are relationships and commitments as we know them even possible in a place where identities are fluid ? The physical world . . . is a place where the identity and position of the people you communicate with are well known , fixed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . We can only exchange words with each other ? no glances or shrugs or ironic smiles . Even the nuances of voice and intonation are stripped away . On top of the technology-imposed constraints , we who populate cyberspace deliberately experiment with fracturing traditional notions of identity by living as multiple simultaneous personae in different virtual neighborhoods. ( p. 61 ) Nonetheless , it seems to be the case that most newsgroups have a small coterie of habitues , with consistently presented personae , who regularly initiate and contribute to message threads , and in the patterns of their posts and replies one can find the traces of what we have come to call virtual community . Despite Peck 's ( 1987 ) caution that we humans " are not yet community creatures , " few writers bother to question their own assumption that computermediated communication virtually carves communities out of cyberspace . The use of the community analogy to describe social aspects of the medium is ubiquitous and seemingly arbitrary . For example , " community " may refer to attenuated networks of virtual strangers exchanging ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to virtual friends debating the finer points of genderbending their on-line personae ( E. Reid , 1991 ) . Such diverse user groups as hackers ( Meyer &; Thomas , 1990 ) , role-playing enthusiasts ( Curtis , 1992 ; Serpentelli , 1992 ) , bulletin board subscribers ( Rheingold , 1993a ; Smith , 1992 ) , and USENET newsgroups ( MacKinnon , 1992 ) have all been designated communities for equally diverse reasons . The question " What constitutes virtual community ? " remains unexplored territory . One apparent truth drives the metaphor : Computer-mediated communicators themselves see their activity as inherently social . Furthermore , this activity takes place in a conceptual , if not perceptual , space : Members of electronic virtual communities act as if the community met in a physical public space . The number of times that on-line conferencees refer to the conference as an architectural place and to the mode of interaction in that place as being social is overwhelmingly high in proportion to those who do not . They // say things like " This is a great place to get together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Stone , 1991 , p. 104 ) Justification for metaphoric use of the term " community " in the research literature stems from two fundamental approaches to research in CMC . One approach looks at discourse processes , another at social structures , and both seek cyberspace analogues to " real life " processes and structures . Discourse processes include the development of distinctive referent language , the virtual equivalent of jargon , such as " flaming " and " chat " ( MacKinnon , 1992 ; E. Reid , 1991 ) , " emote " and " mudding " ( Carlstrom , 1992 ) ; truncated speech , the use of acronyms in place of common phrases ( e.g. , IMHO for " in my humble opinion " ) , and other electronic paralanguage ( Carey , 1980 ) ; the use of " emoticons , " such as ASCII-character smiley faces and other text-rendered nonverbal surrogates ( Asteroff , 1987 ; Blackman &; Clevenger , 1990 ; Danet &; Reudenberg , 1992 ; Sherblom , 1990 ) ; face-saving mechanisms ( Heimstra , 1982 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice &; Love , 1987 ; Smolensky , Carmody , &; Halcomb , 1990 ; Thompsen , 1992a , 1992b ; Walther , 1992 ; Walther &; Burgoon , 1992 ) . Social structures include social and professional roles : for example , hackers , phreakers , and other " outlaws " ( Barlow , 1990 ; Meyer &; Thomas , 1990 ) ; moderators , sysops , chanops , and other " net police " ( MacKinnon , 1992 ; E. Reid , 1991 ) ; sex roles ( Herring , 1993 ; Kramarae &; Taylor , 1993 ; Matheson , 1991 ) ; community boundary indicators , such as distinctive " neigborhood " addresses and domains , and " cultural " differences among communicative systems on the " net " ( Serpentelli , 1992 ) ; rituals , such as weddings and funerals ( Rheingold , 1993a ) ; commitment to communal goals , such as development and maintenance of resources ( Smith , 1992 ) ; and rules , norms , and community standards , such as " netiquette " ( Spafford , 1993a , 1993c , 1993d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our approach in this chapter is to assume , a priori , the existence of analogic processes and structures in CMC . That said , we can also assume that virtual processes and structures function like their real-life counterparts . In brief , discourse processes generate social structures , which in turn affect discourse processes ( Berger &; Luckmann , 1967 ) . A study of process yields evidence of the underlying structure ( Toles-Patkin , 1986 ) . To be sure , there is evidence of community in Usenet ( albeit community enacted on a public stage , with a substantial silent majority of onlookers ) . In no respect is this more apparent than in the discursive working out of community standards of behavior . There is no central authority to which activity on Usenet is subject ( Spafford , 1993e ) ; the existence and the character of newsgroups are shaped jointly by the decisions of individual site adminisStandards // trators , a widely disseminated set of rules for conduct ( netiquette ) ( Spafford , 1993a , 1993c , 1993d ; Taylor , 1993 ; Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsgroup creation , and the expectations of users . Examination of the on-line interactive management of conduct , as it emerges in patterns of posts and replies , has allowed us to formulate a preliminary account of Usenet community standards . Any cursory reading of newsgroup postings will suggest , first , that conductcorrecting episodes are commonplace , reflecting the self-regulating nature of the network ; further , that the type of conduct subject to remediating discourse ranges widely , from relatively innocuous errors in the use of newsreader software to actions characterized as " net terrorism " ; and finally , that the sanctions invoked against such conduct also vary widely , from mildly admonitory private e-mail to active campaigns to deprive offenders of their net access . Using the notion of a reproach , as established in the literature on accounts and explanations ( Cody &; McLaughlin , 1990 ; McLaughlin , Cody , &; Read , 1992 ) , we make a preliminary approach to the questions of standards by looking at what is not allowed and present here a taxonomy of reproachable conduct on Usenet . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of normative expectations that it prompts overt comment and sets discursive remedial sequences in motion . A Taxonomy of Reproachable Conduct on Usenet All articles posted to five newsgroups ? comp.sys.ibm.pc.games ( including **28;1594;TOOLONG , **31;1624;TOOLONG , comp.sys. **29;1657;TOOLONG , **27;1688;TOOLONG , comp.sys.ibm. pc.games.rpg , and **31;1717;TOOLONG ) ; rec.sport.hockey ; soc. motss ; rec.arts.tv.soaps ; and soc.singles ? during the period May 17-June 7 , 1993 were saved and analyzed for episodes of normative discourse : remedial or corrective sequences generated by an unacceptable post/reply or habitual pattern of the same . The groups selected were chosen for their wide propagation , popularity , heavy traffic volume , and low percentage of cross-posting . B. Reid 's ( 1993c ) readership summary for the immediately preceding month was consulted to select newsgroups that ( a ) had more than 25,000 estimated readers , ( b ) were received by at least 70% of surveyed sites , ( c ) had a traffic rate of at least 4,000 kilobytes per month , and ( d ) had crossposting percentages at or near zero . With respect to the latter , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion of messages posted simultaneously to other groups . Readership data from January , February , and May of 1993 confirmed that the five // groups had consistent patterns with respect to popularity , propagation , traffic volume , and cross-posting , although the soc.motss group had episodic spurts of cross-posting in the 15% range ( B. Reid , 1993a , 1993b , 1993d ) . Data from UUNET Communications ( 1993 ) for the sampled period confirmed the readership and traffic standings of three of the five groups : soc.motss , rec. arts.tv. soaps , and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games . Corrective episodes selected for analysis from postings to the five groups during the 3-week period made up a 3.09 megabyte message corpus , accounting for approximately 15% of all message traffic during the interval . Across the five groups , reproaches for conduct were leveled at 272 individuals . Many of these persons were reproached for more than one impropriety , and several were reproached in more than one newsgroup . We note that not all of the examples will apply in all newsgroups , and in fact we observed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , that which gives offense in one newsgroup will be regarded as unremarkable in another ( for instance , " for sale " announcements are welcomed in some quarters and treated with disdain in others ) . Further , those who issue reproaches may find themselves taken to task for nit-picking , bullying newcomers , or generalized nastiness . Our analysis of the message corpus , supplemented by the widely posted " required reading " on netiquette ( Spafford , 1993a , 1993c , 1993d ; Taylor , 1993 ; Von Rospach , 1993 ) led to a seven-category account of Usenet offenses ( see Table 5.1 ) . Exemplars of reproaches in six of the seven categories are presented below with the permission of their authors . ( Ethical considerations of our own obliged us to exclude specific examples of violations of community ethics standards . ) Where included , text from the offending poster is indicated with an arrow ( ) at the beginning of each line . Two arrows ( ) indicate an embedded quotation . Category 1 : Incorrect/Novice Use of Technology Reproaches are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of newsreaders , such as posting a message with a header identifying the author and origin of the message but with no lines ( content ) or inadvertently sending private e-mail to the newsgroup . For instance , a poster apparently having difficulty with the newsreader reply function posted a message containing a full header , quoting the entire lengthy text of a previous poster 's message , but with no message lines of his own . Correctly using the same reply function , which conventionally begins " In a // Table // Table previous article , ** said : " , one of the regulars posted this pointed reproach : In a previous article , ( ( postername@ ************** ) says : Absolutely nothing . Category 2 : Bandwidth Waste Reproaches are given for consuming more than one 's fair share of network resources , such as unnecessarily increasing the costs of transport and storage of Usenet messages by indiscriminate cross-posting of the same message , failing to edit judiciously , or posting questions the answers to which are readily available elsewhere : ( 1 ) #@# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , #@# Washington , DC 20515 until I get something more specific This will probably work . But you can get the exact addresses in many ways : ? check in the phone book for their local offices , and call there . Many Senators have local offices in many cities in their states . ? call the League of Women Voters and ask . ? many ( most ) public libraries have directories of public officials and can give you the information over the phone ? there may be a " government " section in the white pages of your phone directory that lists the addresses I 'm not posting this to dump on you , . But lots of times people post requests for information to the net , when there are easy ways to get it locally . // ( 2 ) Hey , postername , if you 're going to post followups , perhaps you could " trim down the included article " , as they say . At least delete the headers . It 's common netiquette. ( 3 ) nice signature , mind chopping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you wantonly waste with a signature which excedes your actual article . Category 3 : Violation of Networkwide Conventions Reproaches are given for not observing conventions common to all or most Usenet groups , such as neglecting to include a signature , failing to encrypt offensive materials , using an inappropriate subject line , failing to include text of a previous message to which one refers , or failing to follow the group discussion for a period of time before posting : question Could someone out there settle a debate brewing in our department ? We 'd be interested to know the origins of the Montreal Canadiens nick-name the " Nabs " ? Where does the term originally come from , and what exactly does it refer to ? reply Myth #1 : People read the FAQ before posting to a news group . Myth #2 : People follow a news group for a period of a month before posting to that newsgroup . If the poster had done either of these two , the answer would be there . Anyway , HABS is short for Habitants , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some debate and I urge you look at articles posted last week to see what all the fuss is about . Category 4 . : Violation of Newsgroup-Specific Conventions Reproaches are given for demonstrating a lack of awareness of the practices of a specific newsgroup , such as failing to post a " spoiler " warning in the subject heading of a message in which a soap opera development will be revealed or posting a personal ad in a group devoted to discussion and debate about being single : Hi , I 'm a 23 year old graduate student and would like to communicate with any females on this news net .
