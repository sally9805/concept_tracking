Many journalists hoped the case would simply go away ; the prospect of juries setting limits on the work practices of reporters was a newsroom nightmare . But last week the Supreme Court decided otherwise . It unanimously overturned the decision of a federal court and ruled that the discomforting case of journalist Janet Malcolm , accused of libeling her subject by fabricating his quotes , should go to trial . Nevertheless , the reaction from most reporters , though hardly unanimous , tended toward a collective sigh of relief that the decision showed a subtle sensitivity to their craft . <P> The lack of outrage among those likely to be most affected stems in part from the tangled nature of the incident that prompted the trouble . In December 1983 the New Yorker ran a two-part profile by Malcolm of Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson , a psychoanalyst who had lost his job as projects director of the Sigmund Freud Archives in New York City . Published the next year by Knopf as In the Freud Archives , Malcolm 's report apparently allowed Masson to destroy himself with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his plan to transform Anna Freud 's house , after her death , into " a place of sex , women , fun , " and his boast that he would be recognized as " after Freud , the greatest analyst who 's ever lived . " <P> Masson sued for libel , claiming that he had never said any of these things and that other quotations had been distorted to make him look ridiculous . A long legal wrangle ensued , during which Malcolm , in a pretrial deposition , conceded that she had combined a number of Masson 's comments over a period of months to suggest that they had all occurred during a single lunch at a restaurant in Berkeley . Her 40 or so hours of tapes and her notes of interviews with Masson do not contain the three quotations he claimed were fabricated . Still , her legal defense maintained that even if these statements were manufactured  --  which Malcolm has steadily denied  --  they were true to the nature of her subject and thus entitled to First Amendment protection . In 1989 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press , including Malcolm supporters , was happy with a decision that seemed to condone outright inventions  --  between quotation marks  --  in works of nonfiction . But the possibility threatened by Masson 's appeal to the Supreme Court  --  a draconian definition from the bench of how journalists should write their stories  --  seemed even worse . A number of news organizations , including the American Society of Newspaper Editors and Time Warner , filed amicus briefs in support of the New Yorker . <P> As it turned out , the opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy showed considerable understanding of how speech is translated into print . Kennedy condoned the widespread journalistic practice of emending quotations in the areas of grammar and syntax and went even further , stating that " deliberate alteration of the words uttered by a plaintiff does not equate with knowledge of falsity " for the purpose of meeting the actual malice test for libel suits brought by a public figure . Changing a quotation , Kennedy reasoned , can betray a reckless disregard for the truth only " when the alteration results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . " Whether that sort of alteration happened when Malcolm profiled Masson will now be decided by a trial jury in California .
