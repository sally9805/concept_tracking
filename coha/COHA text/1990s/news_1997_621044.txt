<p> After the 1989 earthquake destroyed the Cypress freeway in Oakland , Jim Zelinski was only too happy to leave his Honda at home . <p> " The traffic was barely tolerable then , and it 's horrendous now , " he said . " It 's a grinding , nerve-racking , fume-choked ordeal . " <p> Zelinski sticks to BART to get from his Hayward home to his job in San Francisco . When he ca n't escape the drive , he crawls from Interstate 880 to 980 to 580 to 80  --  a journey that can take an hour and a half . <p> This week , Caltrans will open the first leg of the new Cypress freeway , linking the Bay Bridge with Interstate 880 . Mile for mile , the billion-dollar freeway is the most expensive ever built in California , and Caltrans officials say the improvement in traffic should be dramatic . A formal announcement of the opening day has not been made . <p> But there are nagging questions about how much any new highway can ease the Bay Area 's chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who switched to BART , buses or ferries after the Cypress crumbled on October 17 , 1989 , wo n't be lured back to their cars by a fresh strip of asphalt . <p> Zelinski , for one , has no plans to hit the gas pedal . <p> " The Cypress freeway reopening is really a double-edged sword , " he said . " Certainly it will help the commute , but it fosters the continued reliance on the automobile , which I do n't think is a good thing . " <p> After spending years negotiating a new path for the freeway , buying the land and trying to satisfy community concerns , state Department of Transportation officials are eager for the payoff . <p> They expect traffic on Interstate 580 between I-980 and I-80 to drop to 229,000 vehicles a day once the Cypress opens  --  a decline of 43,000 cars , vans and trucks . Once the rest of the Cypress project is finished next year , they 're looking for traffic to decrease by another 75,000 vehicles a day . <p> Eventually , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half . <p> " It will basically be like it was before the earthquake , " Caltrans spokesman Colin Jones said . " It will eliminate that bottleneck . " <p> Commuters who use the new Cypress to get to San Francisco can expect to save an average of 81/4 minutes during the morning rush hour , Jones said . <p> The new freeway is six lanes  --  two fewer than the old one  --  yet it is expected to carry at least the same amount of traffic as before , 160,000 vehicles a day . The state is counting on car-pool lanes to smooth the flow . Caltrans has also tried to encourage people to use public transportation by paying for new park-and-ride lots , improvements to ferry terminals and other projects . <p> " If you had a 10-lane freeway , unfortunately , people would use it , " Caltrans spokesman Stephen Williams said . " We do n't want to encourage people to pollute any more than they are already . " <p> Some transit experts say the biggest relief from the new Cypress will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drivers on the Eastshore Freeway will finally be able to get directly to the Nimitz again without having to detour to I-980 and I-580 first . <p> But even if congestion at the MacArthur maze improves , the logjam may simply move upstream , said Steve Heminger , manager of legislation and public affairs for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission . <p> " There is going to be more traffic on the new facility than there was on the old one , " Heminger said . " I think it will help the bottleneck somewhat at the maze , but that traffic will have to go somewhere once it gets through that bottleneck better . It may lead to additional congestion at the Bay Bridge toll plaza . " <p> Drivers are already idling more than ever . According to Caltrans , Bay Area residents spent 90,000 hours a day delayed by traffic jams last year , a 31 percent increase from 1995 . <p> At the same time , the region 's population is growing . The Bay Area has 550,000 more residents than in 1990 , according to state estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Berkeley resident Jim Levine , for one , will be glad to see the Cypress finished . " It will make my life a lot easier , " he said . <p> For Levine , the broken link between I-80 and the Nimitz has interfered with getting to everything from his tennis game to his favorite Vietnamese restaurant . He has to allow an extra 20 minutes to get to the court , and he and his wife eat out less often in Oakland than they used to . <p> " It 's been very frustrating trying to get from this side of town to Alameda or Oakland  --  it 's always a hassle , " he said . " The traffic is unpredictable , and it 's usually congested . " <p> From transit boosters ' standpoint , the best thing that came out of the collapse of the Cypress was the increased ridership for BART and the ferries . <p> The earthquake revived commuter ferry service from Oakland and Alameda , which had died out by the 1950s . Boats carried 435,000 passengers in 1996-97  --  more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The quake " provided an opportunity for Caltrans , the city and the port to actually try it , and it worked , " said Ernest Sanchez , manager of the Alameda/Oakland ferry service . " The people who have learned to enjoy the ferry will continue to do that . " <p> BART ridership jumped to 360,000 a day immediately after the quake . The system kept 10 to 15 percent of the ridership it gained , and now carries about 270,000 people each weekday . <p> AC Transit , which has lost thousands of riders in recent years because of service cuts , is expecting to pick up more transbay passengers with the opening of the new Cypress and other highway improvements . <p> " We 're able to get into the city about 20 minutes faster than we used to , " said assistant general manager Jim Gleich . " We see a big demand for fast , efficient transbay service . " <p> Replacing the Cypress was hardly an easy task . In all , Caltrans says , the project will cost about $ 1billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific and relocate homes and businesses . It battled several lawsuits filed in connection with the project , including one from a church that received $ 65,000 to soundproof its sanctuary . The agency also had to deal with contaminated soil discovered on several industrial sites . <p> The old Cypress was a concrete scar in West Oakland , and community and city leaders fought against the idea of a new two-tier structure after the earthquake . Caltrans finally agreed to build the new freeway on the outskirts of West Oakland . <p> Minette Wright does n't miss the old freeway at all . For weeks after the quake , a loud wrecking ball hovered outside her West Oakland house , slowly chipping away at the concrete skeleton . <p> " The dust was so thick you could write your name on the counter , " she said . " You could n't breathe inside the house . " <p> Now that the freeway is gone , sunshine fills her yard again . <p> Orinda resident Carol Brown took BART to her job in San Francisco even before the quake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Cypress collapse changed her life all the same . <p> She met a man on a BART platform a few weeks after Loma Prieta . He was a novice to the transit system and was trying to find his way to the MacArthur station . She rode with him so he would n't get lost , and she did n't think much about it when they exchanged numbers . But he called . They were married on the fourth anniversary of the quake . <p> " We always drink a toast to the earthquake , because we realize we would n't have met without it , " Brown said . " We always say , ' Here 's to earthquakes and shaking up your life . ' It really changed my life . It changed everything . " <p> FACES FROM THE RUBBLE <p> Four people whose lives were affected forever by the collapse of the old Cypress Freeway , and how they feel about its reopening . <p> George Donovan , 53 , of Kensington <p> was hauling an empty truck trailer on the upper deck when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragged several other victims to safety . Only later did he realize he had fractured all the vertebrae in his back . <p> Until recently , Donovan dispatched for a tow truck service in San Francisco . <p> " I had a lot of problems for years afterward , driving or talking or even thinking about those days . And it 's still scary sometimes , but overall it 's a lot better now . Time helps . <p> " The hardest thing for me to remember is how I could hear people underneath me screaming for help . And there was n't anything I could do for so many of them . One kid I could hear screaming , and I kept yelling to him that I would get him help . But after a while his voice just stopped . I still get choked up about that , and I think about it . A lot . " <p> Donovan says he wo n't drive the new stretch of roadway . " I 'll go 580 . I wo n't take that freeway . Ever . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quintero runs a trucking company in West Oakland and was about a block from the Cypress when it collapsed . For three days , he and his drivers worked around the clock , moving other businesses ' equipment that obstructed rescue efforts and helping the Red Cross . <p> " I saw the freeway when it fell . It scared the hell out of me  --  it snapped like a bone . <p> " Everybody in the world came to my office to use my phone . It was the only phone working in the neighborhood for a few days . All the news media was right outside the door . Everybody was really honest  --  nobody stiffed me with the bill . <p> " As soon as they open the stretch from San Jose to the Bay Bridge , it will take a lot of the traffic off the maze . The structure is really nice  --  I think they did a hell of a job . " <p> . <p> Patrick Wallace , 39 , of Portland , Ore . <p> the quake hit , Wallace ran outside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadways collapse with a mighty roar . He climbed into the crushed lower deck to search for survivors and found 6-year-old Julio Berumen trapped in a car . While doctors cut through Julio 's leg to free him , Wallace crawled through the wreckage and rescued several other people . <p> Wallace now is president of Pacific Paper Tube in Portland , and still visits the Oakland office regularly . <p> " It 's all still so vivid , I can recall it totally to this second . I get weird feelings when I see similar things on the news  --  the quake in L.A. , quakes in Indonesia , things like that . " <p> Wallace is eager to drive the new Cypress . " I just think you have to come back , have to grow after an experience like that . And they certainly could n't just let daisies grow in that long stretch . <p> " Once the construction guys got the green light , I was fascinated at what a great job they did . I think it 's a great-looking new stretch of roadway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . <p> Judy Mak , 43 , of Union City <p> was commuting home with her husband and three friends on the top deck when the road collapsed . Mak awoke , still in the back seat between two people , with the Pontiac Sunbird they were in on fire and the doors crushed so they would n't open . <p> A man whose name she never knew pried open the doors and pulled out the five people , all of whom survived . Mak suffered three cracked vertebrae , but has kept a rigorous exercise program and has no lingering pain . <p> " The first thing I did after the quake was say , ' OK , that 's it , no more commuting on bridges or raised freeways . ' " <p> Memories of the quake do n't bother her , " although I do drive faster whenever I go over a bridge . I do n't want to be caught on them if they shake , and I sure do n't want to be on the bottom deck because that 's where you die . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yeah , why not ? Who 's gon na host the opening party ? Oakland or Caltrans ?
