The old woman drowsed beneath an overhang of Orphan Annie hair . The blast of orange swirls and curlicues was blinding in the sun . Monsoon wondered how the old lady could sleep with all that brightness in her face . <p> His backside was going numb against the pavement . Blinking , he scooched sideways for an up-close look at her . Was n't looking none too good . The old woman had the sort of face reminded you there was a skull behind it . Her skin was bluish-white , taffy-speckled . Her mouth looked like some kid had crayoned it in to fill the gap between the sharp points of her nose and chin . <p> " Baby , " Monsoon crooned . " Ooh-ooh , baby . " <p> The old woman opened her eyes and stared at him without expression . Her eyes were the straightforward blue of the larkspur spikes along his granny 's fence back in Macon . His granny had n't got no eyelashes , neither , at the end , no brows to speak of . Old ladies lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked look . <p> " Fuck off . " This one 's voice , though , she sounded like a little girl , even when she got to cussing him out . " Fuck off , " she said . " I mean it . " <p> Monsoon smiled like he 'd accomplished something . " Hey , " he said . <p> " What do you want ? " Her chin pointed at him like a finger . <p> " Want to eat you , " Monsoon said . " Want to eat you up , babe . " He grinned . A few of his teeth were missing . Those left were very white and looked like they 'd been filed down to render him harmless . <p> " Uppity nigger , " the old woman said . <p> " White bitch . " <p> They smiled at each other like parties to an agreement . The street around them was empty of people , crowded with debris . Something as pure as sunlight a sin . The old woman , still smiling , shut her eyes . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like cream till you scream , " he said . <p> " Load me up on the spuds , " Monica said . " Forget about that green stuff . " <p> The girl behind the steam table smiled . There was mist on her glasses . Monica wondered how she could see . <p> " Where are you going to get your vitamins ? " the girl asked . <p> " You do n't want to know , " said Monica . <p> The girl , a student from some college , was always there on Thursdays , always asking questions . She wore loose khaki shorts , even now , in November . At twelve-thirty , when the line was shut down on the dot , she 'd come out from behind the counter and wander from table to table , butting in , making people talk who did n't want to , interrupting those who did . Her name was Karen . Her legs reminded Monica of butterscotch pudding , thick and lumpy and yellowish . Every time Monica saw Karen 's legs , she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant mashed potatoes landed beside a slice of Spam that had a ring of pineapple and a cherry nailed to it with a toothpick . <p> " You can do better than that , " Monica said . <p> Karen 's smile dimmed . She dropped another dab of potatoes on the gray plastic plate . " All right ? " <p> " Do n't go overboard . " <p> Monica pushed past a little kid in a Roger Rabbit T-shirt who had big eyes for the day-old doughnuts . All the ones with frosting were gone . At the end of the line , she snatched up three slices of dry white bread , slipping them into a pocket . Thursday nights , supper was in a church basement halfway across town . She might not feel like making the trip . <p> She was late because of falling asleep in the library , in the little room where they kept the magazines and a couple of almost-comfortable chairs . You were n't allowed to sleep in there . She should probably thank that biddy with the fuzzy blue hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on lunch today . <p> Monica stood by the end of the counter and looked around the room . The white cinder-block walls were painted with clouds and rainbows and flowers that looked like they had faces . The low ceiling and the pipes that ran across it were blue , as if they could fake the sky . As far as Monica could see , there was no room for her anywhere . <p> The tray was getting heavy and the straps of her backpack cut into her shoulders . A lot of people were finished , just sitting there taking up room . Bastards . Monica thought about sitting down right where she was and eating on the floor . Probably would n't get as far as swallowing the first bite , though . Make anything they call trouble , you were n't allowed back in for two weeks . Monica 'd been put off limits more than once . They meant business . " The bastards , " she said . <p> Her legs were swelled up but good today . She could feel the pain pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to bust . Monica squeezed her eyes shut . Gusher , she thought . The word came back to her from a movie she saw once . It was in Texas and had Montgomery Clift in it . Monica pictured blood bursting up out of her head , black and thick , covering everything . Nobody who got anywhere near her would ever be able to wash it off . <p> Monica 's arms had started trembling , when the tray 's weight was suddenly lifted from them . Her eyes flashed open . She saw the food moving out of her reach . It looked better than it had when the girl was dishing it up . <p> " Come on , babe , " Monsoon said . " Got you a sit-down . " <p> " You , " Monica said . <p> He kept walking . <p> Monica followed , trying to keep up with him . The throbbing in her ankles felt like sucking mud . " Who the hell do you think you are ? " <p> " You got all day , " Monsoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Monica spotted two empty chairs at a long plywood table near the back of the room . A tray with a half-eaten meal sat at one place . The other was empty . <p> " Think I 'm about to eat with you , " Monica said , " you got another think coming . " <p> " Meaner you talk , the hotter I get , mama . " Monsoon set down her tray and pulled out her chair . " Gon ' wine and dine you . " <p> Monica came to a halt , looking up at him . He was more than a foot taller than she was , snaky through the hips , wide as a garage door at the shoulders . She thought he was maybe forty , but it was impossible to tell in people who were n't white . He was too damn old , anyhow , to act like he did . <p> " I 'll eat , " Monica said . " But I ai n't talking . " <p> He grinned , his small white teeth flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suits me , " he said . <p> Monica struggled free of her red backpack and eased it to the floor . Her coat , a flare of shredding purple satin with nibbles of yellowed white fur at the collar and cuffs , fell heavily on top of it , the contents of its pockets clanking . She began peeling elbow-length black gloves from her bent fingers . <p> " Woo , " Monsoon said , " take it off ! <p> Ignoring him , she plunked herself down on the metal chair . Her feet did n't touch the floor . Pale flesh puffed out over the tops of her blue bowling shoes like bread dough somebody forgot to punch down . <p> " You better not look at me , either , " she said . " I 'm armed . <p> He did n't know what got him started watching her , why lately it was starting to seem like a habit . She just tickled him sometimes . But mostly the old lady was like a bad accident , Monsoon thought . You did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They 'd both been on the street for a few years now , Monsoon since the old VA hospital shut down , Monica since the rooming house on Diversey burned up . Not that this was the first time for either of them on the street . Just the longest . And maybe the last , the way things were looking . Monsoon made out all right . Seemed like maybe the old lady was wearing down , though . <p> Monica had always been around somewhere , on the edges of things , as far back as he could remember . She would n't always have been old , of course , but his memory had n't kept any other pictures of her . <p> " What do you want from me ? " she 'd ask him sometimes when she caught him staring at her . " What the hell are you after ? " <p> " Want to sniff your drawers , " Monsoon would tell her . " Find out is white meat as sweet as they say . " <p> The more impervious the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skin . She brought out his poetic streak . " Want to lick your knickers , " he said . " Take a spin through your skin ... wo n't never let me out once you get me in . " <p> Monica just gave him a jaded look . " You 're no James Whitcomb Riley , bub , " she said . <p> Monsoon did n't understand more than a tenth what she talked about . Hello and goodbye , please and thank you , did n't exist in her language . Sometimes when Monsoon laid hold of a bottle , he 'd share it with her . The old lady favored apricot brandy and gin , but she 'd drink anything , long as she was n't expected to show gratitude for it . <p> One spring night  --  must have been back in May , it was n't really warm yet  --  they 'd gnawed on sweet-and-sour baby sparerib bones in the alley behind Cafe Polynesia , meanwhile polishing off a whole fifth of peppermint schnapps Monsoon had risked his neck to come by . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greyhound had a gun down under the counter . Was n't nobody did n't know it since the Preston boy got blown away for <p> pint of Ron Rico and a couple Slim Jims . <p> " Stuff tastes like Colgate , " Monica said . <p> " Ai n't nobody making you imbibe , old woman . " <p> " ' Imbibe ' ? " The old lady had a laugh like a maggoty old myna bird he 'd seen in a whorehouse in Bangkok , sound to make a man 's cock keel over limp as collards . <p> " Means drink . " Monsoon was haughty . <p> " I know what it means , " said Monica . " What I do n't know is where you get off sounding so uppish . " She tossed back another mouthful before passing the bottle back to him . " Pegged you for <p> phony the first time I saw you . " <p> " Nothin ' phony ' bout me , " said Monsoon . " Not like , say , that hair you wearin . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She sniffed . " Monsoon . Gim me a break . " <p> " They give it to me in the army , " he said . " Means a storm . " <p> " Somebody say I needed an interpreter ? " She snatched the bottle and took a long swallow . " Ferocious like a storm , huh ? Is that what I 'm supposed to think ? " <p> " Hot and wet and  --  " He licked his lips and smiled dirty . " Liable to start up out of nowhere and go on for weeks . " <p> The old lady shrugged . " I seen some real storms , " she said . <p> Monsoon looked her over . " I can see that , " he said . <p> At dawn , behind a dumpster smelling of tropical fruits and rotting sh , they 'd thrown up together . Monsoon hardly remembered that part , though , except he 'd lost his taste for peppermint schnapps since then . What came back to him afterwards , locked onto his mind , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jabbered on through the chilliest part of the night , telling him in a dreamy voice about some old church outside of Paris where the corpses of kings and queens were just lying right there where you could see them . <p> Monsoon had run into a few corpses himself . The Mekong Delta was full of them . But in a church , left to lie for more than a hundred years and nobody even burying them ? <p> Their fingers were as long and tapered as silver dinner knives , Monica said . And their faces looked snooty , like they were turning up their noses at heaven . <p> " Must stink in there , " Monsoon said . " All them dead carcasses . " Monica shook her head . <p> " Must . " Monsoon was definite . " And flies ... " <p> " In France they turn to stone when they die . " The old woman laughed . If it was a joke , Monsoon did n't get it . <p> " And maggots , " he said . " Shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been some Frenchie stonecutter , she said , who made marble angels and swans and lambs to decorate gardens and graves . They lived up north , in Vermont . When Monica was sixteen , her mama died in a mill fire . Her daddy took it in his mind to sell the house and use the money to take his one and only child to see the dead kings and queens in the church where he got baptized when he was just a week old , and they went on a big boat . <p> " I was sick the whole way , " Monica said . " My father just stood out on the deck and stared at the sea , never said a word . The waves got as big as those high-rises over there . " She nodded toward State Street . " He looked like a statue , " she said . " I saw it coming . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Just never you mind , " she said . <p> Monsoon was skeptical . " You really been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were an ocean away . <p> " San Denny , " she called the place , or something like that . " I tell you , death do n't make a dent , " she said . <p> " I know what you mean , " Monsoon said after a while . He wanted to tell the old lady about the times he 'd walked away from it himself , but she 'd gone fast asleep in the crook of his arm by then . <p> When he was sure she was out , Monsoon touched her hair . It reminded him of something you 'd scour out pots with . With the lipstick gone , her mouth was just a little round opening . Her lips made a soft popping sound that sent a sour minty smell up around his face . <p> Before long , Monsoon , his back propped against the restaurant 's concrete back stoop , dozed off , too . He dreamed about the church he 'd never seen and could hardly believe in . The dead kings and queens and even Jesus on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Monica was gone . His bottle was bone-dry , and the sky in the east , yellowish and full of long stringy clouds , looked like egg drop soup . <p> Been on top of things , Monsoon thought , woulda seen trouble coming and headed it off . Like it was , though , too busy working on getting a rise out of the old woman . So it was easy for Darnelle to come sneaking up behind , the loony shine in her eyes like usual , only brighter . Picking pink gristle out his teeth and talking dirty left them both , him and the old lady , wide-open . <p> " Gon ' bury my nose in your panty hose , " was what he was saying , a new one he 'd been saving up for her . " Stroke your leg till you beg . " <p> Monica , her mouth crammed full of white stuff , was paying him no mind . <p> " Mama in for a treat ' cause I 'm a  --  " <p> Darnelle swooped down like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next thing he knew , the old lady was laid out flat on the floor , food and spit running down her chin and her legs splayed out pale and puffy and advertising her serious need of some underwear . <p> Seemed , though , like Monica did n't know what was left to showing , her dress bunched up at her waist that way . Her hands had no thought but to cover her head . Meanwhile , crazy Darnelle Featherstone 's dancing out the door toting Monica 's wig like Salome with John the Baptist 's head on a plate , a sight so unreal that it maybe explained why nobody even tried to stop her . She was n't right in the head , Darnelle . Was n't nobody did n't know it . <p> Monsoon knew it better than most . <p> Monica was n't getting up . <p> " You all right , mama ? " Monsoon said . <p> What come from her mouth had n't a thing to do with words . The soft , weak sounds were worse than screaming . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsoon , for a second , had to close his eyes . <p> When he got himself together enough to open them again , Monica was still on the floor , all nakedness below and ruin above , her head like an egg in the nest of her small freckled hands . <p> Monsoon knelt down beside her , yanked down her skirt . " Let 's fix you up , " he said . With his bare fingers , he wiped the food and spit from her face , rubbed his hands on his pants . <p> " Come on . " He stood up slowly , then reached down to pull her up . <p> The terrible soft sounds kept leaking from her mouth , her hands kept hold of her skull . A few wisps of hair , thin and white as spider webs , were pasted to her scalp . <p> Leaning down , Monsoon grasped Monica under the arms and lifted her to her feet . There was hardly any weight to her . She went silent , pressing her lips together . Her eyes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , thank you . " The steely-eyed sister in charge was all of a sudden in his face , that nosy Karen behind her . Making hushing sounds , they enclosed the old lady like brackets and led her away . She looked like a tiny child between them . They vanished into the corridor behind a fire door that said " Staff Only . " <p> When Monica did n't return after more than half an hour , Monsoon got up to go . The dining hall was empty , the tables cleared and scrubbed down . Clanking pans and rushing water made a racket in the kitchen . The hot room smelled of Lysol and overcooked food . <p> Before he went out to the street , Monsoon picked up the old woman 's things and placed them on the table . The backpack was heavy . Seemed like even the thready coat packed more heft than she did . <p> He did n't see her at the soup kitchen , or anywhere , for four days . Not that he was actually looking for her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowed on Sunday night , though , Monsoon could n't stop thinking about that crazy purple coat of hers . Like something Billie Holiday might have been wearing to jump from a limo to the Cotton Club 's stage door . Only that would have been fifty years ago , when the coat was new . And not in winter , either . Empty out them big pockets , that rag would n't add up to a pound on a cheating butcherman 's scale . <p> He knew everywhere to look . Was n't a warm spot or dark corner in the city Monsoon had n't ducked into himself a time or two . But he did n't know a soul to ask . It dawned on him now what a loner the old lady was . He 'd never seen her hanging out with nobody . Fact was , he might be about the only one she ever talked with , if you could call that talking . <p> Thing was , she 'd need to eat . And get in and out of the nights , now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was n't showing . up at none of them . <p> Monday nights , the Salvation Army dished out chili at the shelter in the old armory . The chili , lukewarm and gluey , without a bit of spice or meat in it , was something he 'd look forward to about as much as withdrawal . Rather go hungry Monday evening than pass Tuesday morning in the bus station lavatory with the trots . Monsoon figured he 'd swing by the armory , though , in case the old lady wandered in . She had a cast-iron stomach . Maybe he could choke down a cup of their stewed coffee while he checked things out . <p> Monica was n't there . But Darnelle Featherstone , crazy bitch , was . Monsoon saw her traipsing through the line , had on red and white knee socks like one of Santy 's elves with them stiletto-heel pumps she been wearing till they got ground down to bitty stumps . The old lady 's hair was hanging from Darnelle 's belt loop like a scalp on some damn Injun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making himself scarce until Darnelle sat down on a wooden bench along the wall . He let her get a big mouthful half-chewed before he got the jump on her . The wig came off her belt with a ripping sound . <p> " Ought to kill you , " he said . <p> He expected her to let loose with a yell . Darnelle was famous for that . Every couple months she 'd clear a place out  --  the soup kitchen or bus terminal , a schoolyard , even a church , she did n't care  --  with her haint hollering that made your heart stop and your eardrums hope to hell you were dying . <p> But she must have been losing steam , Darnelle , or on something . She just looked up at Monsoon with those how-now-brown-cow eyes and kept right on eating . <p> Monsoon bent down , bringing his face right next to hers . " See you fuck with that lady ... see you fuck with anybody that way again , " he said , " I will seriously mess with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them mashed brown beans . " Been hopin ' you do somethin ' to me , baby . It 's a while now , ai n't it ? " <p> Monsoon , looking at her , felt sick . He had done , once . Darnelle never let him forget it . High as the moon and crazier than she was , back then . She said he was her baby 's daddy , even though the little girl got born two , three years after that one sorry night . <p> Monsoon crushed Monica 's wig and shoved his fist into his pocket . Darnelle 's smile was sweet , loose like her mind . <p> " How you getting on ? " Monsoon said after a moment . " How 's Jamiel ? " <p> " She missing her poppy . " Darnelle licked her teeth , then smiled again . She looked almost like the fine young thing she used to be , running the streets with Monsoon 's baby sister when he had one . <p> " She  --  what  --  four now , Jamiel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Ought to come round and see her . " <p> " She with you now ? " The little girl had been , so far as he knew , in foster homes since she was a year old . <p> Darnelle 's placid brown eyes went hazy . She mumbled something , her mouth full again . <p> " Say what ? " <p> She was staring across the room at a long span of empty bench . The chili was n't selling too good . There were n't twenty people in the huge cold room . <p> " Say I got pitchers , " Darnelle said . " Come by and see her , all right ? " <p> Monsoon sighed . " Maybe I do that , " he said . <p> Darnelle hunched over her bowl , her eyes half-closed . Her jaw muscles were twitching up and down . Monsoon could n't tell if she was chewing or praying or shivering . <p> " You take care now , Darnelle , " he said . " Hear ? " <p> She started humming " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands deep into his pockets as he headed out into the cold . The old lady 's wig felt cool and shapeless and stiff , like something dead at the side of a lonely road . <p> Nothing he tried to find her turned up a clue . The old lady did n't leave tracks . When he finally got mad and gave up looking , Monsoon nearly tripped over her . <p> At first he thought she was dead . The old lady was laid out on <p> marble slab at the foot of a side altar in the little Catholic church on Market Street . Her backpack was shoved under her head like a lumpy pillow , her coat spread over her . A painted statue of Mary and the Baby Jesus was backed into a carved hollow above the little altar , a bank of stubby candles in red shot glasses burning below . Their light made Monica 's small , sharp profile look like marble , pink as dawn and veined with blue . <p> A church would have been the last place he 'd think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in himself if the night had n't been so damn cold and the church the first place he saw that he could get inside . St. Martin de Porres was the only church in the whole city that kept open all night now . <p> When the council had passed a law that all churches had to be locked after dark except with services going on , Father Mack , the pastor , raised holy hell . The homeless had to have someplace to go , he said . The city got all heated up over it . Hazard , they said . Public nuisance , they said . When Father Mack and St. Martin 's got a judge to see things right , the council retaliated by yanking all the benches out of Buchanan Park . <p> Nobody took much advantage of the church , for all of that . It was dark and damp and barely heated . From spring to fall , though , the park benches had been sort of like a club . Folks felt safe there , clustered under the big amber lights . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . <p> Two old bums in one raggedy sleeping bag were filling the church vestibule with snores and the smell of cheap bourbon . Monsoon nearly stepped on them on his way in . Not that they 'd likely notice . The candles drew him up front to the side altar . From a distance their pale red light looked warm . <p> The toes of his boots stopped only a few feet short of the old woman . Monsoon froze for a moment . Her chest did n't seem to be moving . <p> He dropped to his knees and lowered his cheek near her mouth . Her lips were just slightly parted . He felt the fever from her skin before her breath touched his cheek . " Oh shit , " he said . <p> Her eyes , purplish-black in the candlelight , gave away no surprise or alarm . She just looked at him . " You again , " she said . <p> Her hands were clasped on her chest , outside the covering of her coat . She lifted them slowly and touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like claws . When she felt the black knit cap , she pulled it down more snugly , then her hands dropped away . " What the fuck you want ? " <p> Monsoon tried to come up with reason or rhyme , but he 'd lost the taste for sass . Heat radiated from her scrawny body , washing up over his knees and thighs like a warm tide , rising up to his belly , his chest , as he knelt over her . <p> " Where you been , mama ? " <p> " Around . " Monica struggled to sit up . <p> " Been lonesome for you . " <p> She turned and looked at the statue of Mary and the Child . " What a crock , " she said . <p> " Brought you something . " <p> Her eyes brightened a little . " To drink ? " <p> " Better . " Monsoon reached into his pocket and pulled out the wig . The curls had gone flat and tangled . He tried to fluff it up a little before passing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar without a glance . " You got anything to eat ? " <p> " You want the prime rib or the turkey ? " Monsoon grinned . " Woulda brought ribs but they kinda messy . " <p> " You 're a real hoot , " Monica said . " You know it ? " She lay back down and pulled her coat up to her chin , folding her arms under it . <p> " Look like a damn mummy , " Monsoon said . <p> She did n't answer him . Her legs , exposed to the knee , were bare , and one was badly ulcerated , a festering overblown rose above her ankle . <p> " Under the weather , ai n't you ? " Monsoon slipped off his army jacket and covered her legs . <p> She kicked at the jacket , and it flew off the marble step and landed in the darkness below them . " I 'm all right . " <p> " Oh , yeah , " Monsoon said . " Can see you fine <p> She shut her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Monsoon said gently . " If it 's all somebody got to give you . " <p> Her eyes flashed open . " You can go to hell , " she said . Then her eyelids lowered again , and she pressed her lips together until her mouth disappeared into itself . <p> " Remind me of a ' aspirin , " he said . " Bitty old white thing , all hard and sour . " <p> The old woman stayed locked in behind her eyes . <p> Monsoon , still kneeling , dropped his butt to the floor beside her . The marble was cold and slick as ice . " Okay , " he said . " That 's how you want to be . " <p> After a time his own eyes grew heavy . He reached down below the step , found his jacket , and laid it over her legs again . Then he sidled closer to the heat of her and closed his eyes . <p> " And you can just stop looking at me , too , " Monica said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She was staring at the statue . Mary 's head was bent in what might have been modesty or sorrow or shame . But the Child 's eyes , penetrating , full of light , seemed to be taking in everything  --  the old lady , Monsoon , the sleeping bums and the empty pews , the small spill of light and the infinite darkness beyond it . <p> " I can see perfect in the dark , " she said . " Always could . " <p> Monsoon wrapped his arms around himself and rested his forehead on his knees . " Me , too , " he said . <p> " We shoulda been spies . " <p> " Right , " Monsoon said . " But which side ? " <p> The old woman 's hands crept out from under the coat and stroked a snip of pale fur . Her breathing whistled like the wind . <p> " Overboard in a storm on the way home , " she said . <p> He figured she was talking in her sleep . Monsoon had heard the courthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't chimed four yet . Though he was far from sleep himself , he was n't really awake , either . The old lady 's breathing had got to sounding tough and tangled now , like weeds she could n't get through . <p> " The captain tore up the letter . If it was an accident , I 'd get some money , he said . The little bits of white paper flew up in the air , and I never saw them touch the water . " <p> Without raising his head , Monsoon reached out to touch her face . His fingers were too cold to tell if she was really getting hotter . Seemed like , though . " Ssh , " he said . " Get back to sleep now . " <p> " The angels ' heads were always bent down , " she said . " Their wings kept folded up tight . " <p> " Allright , " Monsoon said . " Ssh . " <p> " For a long time I remembered that like something that only happened after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Monsoon 's palm smoothed her forehead . " You hush now . " <p> " But when I got older than him , which was soon , I knew he was always sad . " She sighed . " Always . Even the garden angels with the sun all over them made me cry . You could n't see it , but all the wings were broken . " <p> " It 's okay , " Monsoon whispered . <p> " Some people are an accident before they even get born . " She tossed her head , and his hand slipped from his brow . " You think I 'm dreaming , " she said bitterly . " You 're making a big mistake if you think I do n't know the difference . " <p> Monsoon lifted his head from his knees . The old lady 's eyes were wide-open , intent on his face . <p> " No , " Monsoon said . " You 're not dreaming . " <p> After a moment , she nodded . <p> " Probably ought to be gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed hoarsely . " Nod out now I 'll miss the best part . " She coughed , her body going rigid . The will she exerted to stop was like another person between them . When her body finally went lax , Monsoon , alone with her , felt frightened . <p> Her eyes were watering . Monsoon wiped them with the cuff of his sweatshirt . <p> " Listen , you , " Monica said . " I can handle it . " <p> " Never said you could n't . " <p> She smiled . " For a long time I thought I knew what I was waiting for . Exactly , " <p> He waited . <p> " The fucking angels would rear up their heads like wild horses , " she said . " Christ . " <p> " Ai n't nothing like that , " Monsoon said . <p> " It 's like the kings and queens , " she said . " All stone and stillness . " <p> Her voice had grown weak . She was shivering . <p> " Got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For what ? " Her laugh was strangled by coughing . <p> " Never mind Monsoon unknotted himself , stretching his arms and legs . Then , moving slowly , he inched down beside her . <p> " Do n't , " she whispered . " That 's close enough . " <p> " Okay . " He slipped an arm under her neck , lifted her head from the backpack , and cradled it in the crook of his arm . <p> " You should have seen me . " Her breath wreathed his face , bitter and steamy . <p> Monsoon drew her closer . " I reckon , " he said . <p> " He put my face on every damn one of those angels . " Her eyes brimmed and shimmered . " I saw myself everywhere , " she said . <p> With surprising strength and quickness , Monica grabbed the shoulders of her coat and flipped it up into the air . Her pockets were empty now , had to be . The purple satin sailed , spreading out wide , hanging above them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both inside it . <p> " I want you to get out of here , " Monica said . <p> " It 's freezing . " Monsoon tightened his hold on her . " Long ways to morning . " <p> She wrenched her head around and glared at him . " Fuck morning , " she said . <p> She did n't talk for a long while after that , but Monsoon knew she was n't sleeping . Her breathing was too labored , her body tight . The clock chimed four . She stayed close , letting him keep hold of her , but slanting her face away . He wondered if she saw the statue . Monsoon kept trying not to look at it . <p> The old woman let the echo of the fifth chime fade away before she rolled away from him . " Get going , " she said . " I mean it . " Her voice was firm and clear . <p> " No way . " <p> She moved farther away , widening the chilly space between them . Monsoon could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't have much stamina . He wanted to fight fair . <p> " Go ? " he said . " Why should I ? " <p> She turned her back to him . " Because I 'm telling you to , " she said . <p> Monsoon sat up and rubbed his eyes . Still nothing but blackness to the church . " It 's almost daybreak , " he said . " We get some breakfast in you and  --  " <p> " Get the fuck out of here . " She rolled onto her back and stared up at him . <p> It seemed like he was caught in her eyes forever . Her cap had fallen off and lay beside her on the floor in a pool of reddish light . Her head was nothing but a skull . <p> " Just wait , all right ? " he said . " Hold on . " <p> " I been waiting all my life , " she said . <p> Monsoon smiled . " Think you can do a number on me , old woman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm armed . " <p> In the back of the church one of the old men moaned in his sleep , then began to snore again . Monsoon stared at Monica . Her eyes , fixed on the statue , looked like polished dark stones . He looked up . For the first time Monsoon noticed that the Child held something round and gold with a little cross on the top of it . <p> " Please , " Monica said . <p> The globe , gleaming a dull orange in the candlelight , looked too large , too heavy for the infant 's hand . Monsoon sucked in his breath . Finally , he nodded . " Your call , " he said . <p> " Thank you , " the old woman said . <p> When he nodded again , his head felt like an impossible burden for his neck , and his shoulders ached . <p> Monsoon stood up slowly , easing his way back into his cramped limbs , his numb feet . <p> " Do n't forget your jacket . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell would I want with something like that ? " <p> " Right . " He picked up the jacket and put it on . <p> " See you , " Monica said . <p> Monsoon hesitated . " What if you change your mind ? " he said . <p> The old woman 's laugh , short and sharp , pierced the silence like the cry of a frenzied bird . <p> The dark seemed bottomless . Monsoon stepped off the altar . One hand raised , he turned around and reached back toward the light , as if its frail radiance could steady him . <p> The old woman 's profile was stony and white . His arm dropped to his side . " Be seeing you , " he said . <p> Keeping his eyes on her , Monsoon backed into the dark . The blackness seemed to stretch at least as far above as it did below . <p>
