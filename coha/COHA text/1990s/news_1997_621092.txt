<p> ' BREAST CANCER EPIDEMIC IS PREVENTABLE ' <p> Editor  --  Thank you for your September 15 editorial which exposed the link between environmental pollutants and breast cancer . Your commitment to truth must continue until we all understand that the breast cancer epidemic is both unnatural and preventable . As anyone who has lost someone to breast cancer already knows , mammograms , masectomies and chemotherapy are often not enough . The deaths of thousands of women every year must not be in vain ; we not only have to identify the causes , we must act against those who poison our air , our water , our food and our bodies . <p> At this point , researchers have singled out many toxins which are commonly linked to breast cancer . We know , for instance about organo-chlorine pesticides and PCBs . Of course there are more , but this battle has to start somewhere and it must start soon . Form community groups , join Breast Cancer Action , write to your elected representatives , donate money and attend protests . Demand that your voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wives and friends are dying . <p> CAITLIN McCUNE <p> Napa <p> . <p> HAZARDS TO HEALTH <p> Editor  --  There is a provocative concordance of articles in last Monday 's Chronicle : William Carlsen 's report on the dissemination of the probably carcinogenic gasoline additive , MTBE , and your editorial in response to Susan Yoachum 's battle with breast cancer . We all hope , as you do , for progress in diagnosis and treatment of breast and other cancers , for Ms. Yoachum and all of us who are or may be drafted unwilling into this same battle . <p> However , it is crucial to never lose sight of the fact that the best treatment for cancer is prevention . The present and continuing pollution of our air and water by industrial by-products or wastes , insecure storage of bio-active or radioactive toxins , and the growing plague of automobiles is out- racing by far any reasonable hope of gains in treatment " magic " likely to emerge from basic or medical research . <p> One duty of a newspaper is to alert the community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our job as newspaper readers is to let our elected representatives know that we do not accept risks of this type passively , and that we want our legislators to act more effectively to protect us from carcinogens . <p> We understand that there will be powerful commercial interests opposed to ending and cleaning up the MTBE contamination . This will not excuse our representatives from their duty to act in the best interests of the citizenry . <p> RICHARD . R. ROSMAN <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> MTBE DEFENDED <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle has dipped into a bag of fear-mongering in its coverage on the gas additive MTBE . <p> MTBE enables Californians to use a fuel which meet clean air standards and offers the octane level drivers demand . Scientific review of all of the available information , including studies designed to specifically evaluate allegations of adverse health effects reported to date , does not support the viewpoint highlighted in the reports . The Environmental Protection Agency and other government and academic organizations have conducted more than 75 health and safety studies over the past 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be harmful to people at levels to which consumers are normally exposed with a substantial margin of safety . The distinguished National Academy of Sciences and World Health Organization have reviewed the studies and reached the same conclusion . <p> Has it been effective ? The proof is in the air . <p> According to the California Air Resources Board , since its introduction last summer , cleaner- burning gasoline has removed the emission-reduction equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars off the road everyday . <p> Of course , it is not acceptable for MTBE or any other gasoline component to be in water supplies . In those cases where it has been found above health levels it is usually due to a leaky pipe or tank . Current regulation require responsible parties , not the water districts , to clean up such problems . <p> Dr. JAMES EMBREE , DABT <p> Geomatrix Consultants <p> Folsom <p> . <p> IT 'S THE LITTLE THINGS <p> Editor  --  Health officials worry about french bread sticking out of bags while MTBE poisons our air and water . <p> ADRIENE GALLAGHER <p> San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great . If I understand your excellent article on MTBE correctly , we now have less hazardous material in the air , but more in the water supply . This is progress ? <p> Considering the hike in gas prices that occurred when MTBE was introduced , and the cleanup costs that will now have to be paid out to fix the water problem , I get the feeling that good old Joe Blow , the long-suffering taxpayer , has got the sharp end of the screw on this one . <p> All the politicians , bureaucrats and environmentalists who contributed to this wonderful piece of clear thinking ought to be asked to move themselves and their families into an area near one of the polluted water sources until a permanent solution to the problem has been found . <p> MALCOLM CARDEN <p> Piedmont <p> . <p> DO N'T RELY ON TRANSIT <p> Editor  --  In your September 15 editorial you note that the already overpaid/undermotivated BART workers benefited from the previous week 's temper tantrum . Magically , BART fares wo n't go up  --  yet . But the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have to make up the difference somehow . <p> Your politically correct claim that the strike " underscores the value of mass transit " rings hollow . If the strike teaches us anything about public transportation , it is that we are fools to rely on it . <p> JEFF BISHOP <p> El Sobrante <p> . <p> QUESTIONS FOR BART <p> Editor  --  Now that BART is running again several questions should be asked of the BART board . 1 ) Is there any reasonable explanation for the perpetual breakdown of escalators at some of the stations ? Civic Center and Embarcadero come to mind . They inflict a serious impediment upon elderly users . 2 ) Speaking of escalators , why in the world do they run down but not up during rush hour in the afternoon ? That 's another impediment for seniors . 3 ) When does BART plan to train station agents to stop chatting among themselves and serve the public , or is that asking too much ? 4 ) The $ 3,000 per employee bonus for 1997 seems to me to amount to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual salary of $ 40,000 . Why so much ? <p> STEVE SCHNEIDER <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> BAN TRANSIT STRIKES <p> Editor  --  As a longtime rider of Caltrain I was only slightly affected by the BART strike . Many of my co-workers were not as lucky . I think we really must consider making it illegal for BART and other public transit organizations to strike . The affect the strike has on everyone in the greater Bay Area is too great to allow it to happen again . I think that they should be required to have binding arbitration . <p> Another thought , I would not like to see all of our transit options managed ( or mismanaged ) by one mega-organization . What I really think we need is to have all of the current organizations working together on an integrated plan . Right now we have nothing close to that . To make this work the politician must support it . Mayor Brown 's veto of moving Caltrain terminal to First and Mission streets is a sign that he does not support an integrated system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get people out of their cars and on to public transit then it must be easy and convenient for the public to use . What a concept ! <p> BETTY FELLOWS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FASHION STATEMENT
