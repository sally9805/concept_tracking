At last May 's Cannes Film Festival it won a hotly disputed prize for " originality , daring and audacity . " In November it nabbed five Genies ( Canada 's Oscar equivalent ) , including one for director David Cronenberg . It also earned a chilling blast of invective from Ted Turner , boss of bosses of the film 's U.S. distributor , Fine Line Features ( and vice chairman of Time Warner , parent of TIME ) . Now Crash  --  from J.G. Ballard 's notorious 1973 novel , and with an NC-17 warning sticker affixed  --  finally opens in the country that invented car culture . <P> Its premise is custom-made to shock : five people take their pleasure by making love in the twisted wrecks of cars . Not simple thrill seekers , these folks have turned their kink into a cult , elevated making out in the backseat to sadomasochistic levels , converted rubbernecking into a black art . They preach " the reshaping of the human body by modern technology . " Their grail is James Dean 's Porsche Spyder 550 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kinda creepy , huh ? <P> Fade in on a luscious blond , sleek as a vintage Corvette , who presses her breast against a car hood while an anonymous man caresses her skin as if it were rich Corinthian leather . The scene is from a film being shot by director James Ballard ( James Spader ) , and the star is Ballard 's wife Catherine ( Deborah Kara Unger ) . <P> But this is just fun and games . The real show begins when Ballard 's car jumps a barrier and head-ons another car ; the driver is killed , but his wife , a doctor ( Holly Hunter ) , survives . Ballard meets her at the hospital , and in a trice they are having urgent sex in an airport garage . The doctor tells of her other sexcapades in cars : " They felt like traffic accidents . " She loves making love to men with scars ; to her , each wound is an orifice , and auto eroticism is an aphrodisiac . It is more  --  a sacrament  --  to Vaughan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him a priest of the car cult . He seeks immortality in heavy-metal scrapes with death . <P> Cars and sex do have things in common : acceleration , aggression , contact , combustion . Cinema , eternal celebrant of the stupid-funny car crash , is the ideal medium to anatomize America 's fetishizing of the automobile . And Cronenberg is the very guy for the job . His first commercial film , Fast Company , was about stock-car racing ; his brilliant remake of The Fly was a parable of love , decay and death , of man misguidedly using machinery to transform himself . <P> An intellectual and a sensualist , Cronenberg graces Crash with philosophical musings , acres of pretty flesh and even more penis talk than on some 8 o'clock sitcoms . For all that , Crash does n't work . Sexual without being sexy , the film moves smoothly but slowly , like a Caddy on a revolving showroom platform . Dialogue scenes are conducted in a reverent whisper ; only the brakes screech , just after a climax or before a death . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictably weird sex with most of the others  --  is too studied . The fine actors disport themselves solemnly , like giant hood ornaments of lust . <P> Maybe a little careering delirium would have helped . It may seem perverse to demand that an outrageous film go still further , faster , wilder . But if it had , Crash would n't be the honorable chore it finally is  --  less a joyride than an endless traffic jam . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
