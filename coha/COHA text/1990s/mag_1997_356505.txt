Elvis has Graceland . Jim Morrison 's plot at Pere-Lachaise in Paris has been the subject of such devotion and commotion that the cemetery 's keepers have threatened to expel the coffin . But on a recent Friday afternoon at the Seaside Memorial Park in Corpus Christi , Texas , no poignant notes or fresh flowers bedeck the black gravestone of Selena Quintanilla Perez . The place is deserted  --  until two young people approach to pay their respects . Roddy Gomez , 27 , and his fiance Lisa Castro , 18 , moved from Arizona two months ago , simply to live in the city of their idol . " It looks so plain , it 's hard to believe she 's buried here , " says Gomez . Castro thinks the site is pretty . " But somehow I thought it would be bigger . " <P> No matter . The fans of Selena , Queen of Tejano , are about to get a $23 million memorial , and they need n't make a pilgrimage to this Gulf-port city either . Two years after the Mex-Tex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a reverent Hollywood biopic is opening around the country . Selena , from writer-director Gregory Nava ( El Norte , Mi Familia ) , stars Jennifer Lopez in a Spanish-accented version of the old star-is-born tale . Urged on by her father ( Edward James Olmos ) , a gifted girl rises to the top of her niche market . She falls in love and elopes with her band 's guitarist ( Jon Seda )  --  a defiant gesture that tests but does n't defile her dad 's love . She 's ready to ride the pop mainstream when Yolanda Saldivar , a trusted friend , cuts Selena down at 23 . End of a life , beginning of a legend . <P> " I did n't do the movie to exploit my daughter , " insists Abraham Quintanilla Jr. , 57 , who formed the group Selena y Los Dinos when the girl was just nine and served as its manager and goading spirit . " I did it because there 's an insatiable desire from the public to know more about her . " Nonetheless , Selena is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career maintenance that not only honors but also profits from a slain celebrity . Selena still has three albums on Billboard 's Latin Top 50 chart . Music awards continue to come her way . The family has kept promoting Selena hair salons , Selena fashions and a new Selena doll ( $22 plus tax ) . <P> Scavengers are also circling . E ! the Entertainment Channel aired a re-enactment of Saldivar 's trial and plans to rebroadcast it soon . And in Selena 's Secret , the newest of at least half a dozen unsanctioned bio books about the star , author and Univision hostess Maria Celeste Arraras coyly hints that Selena kept a secret diary and was planning to torpedo her career for a tryst with the Mexican plastic surgeon who administered her liposuction treatments . The family denies these scandals . <P> The Selena film studiously avoids the sensational . It dares to be a slow , stolid film about goodness , to build its story on the rock of family love . The main conflict is over Selena 's love for long-haired Chris , the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he 's a rebel without a chord . Chris is also the excuse for a later tearful reconciliation between Selena and Dad . Though they are often at loggerheads , they are never at loggerhearts . Selena 's too devoted for that . She 's a modern-day saint in spandex.
