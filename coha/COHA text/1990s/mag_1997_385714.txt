GOOD IDEAS ARE OUT THERE . YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE TO LOOK . Photograph // FOR MANY LIFE SCOUTS , the biggest hurdle to earning the Eagle Scout badge is the service project . Right now thousands of Scouts are looking for project ideas . Each year more than 30,000 Life Scouts find an answer and earn their Eagle . Others stumble over the question and never get beyond Life rank . So , where can you search for ideas ? Getting an Idea Some Scouts dream up their own projects . One is Jason Kros of Troop 299 , Salt Lake City , Utah . Last year was the 100th anniversary of Utah 's statehood , so Jason decided to do a hands-on history project . He spruced up a cemetery where some of Utah 's pioneer settlers are buried . " The cemetery caretaker told me that some graves of the pioneers did not have headstones because their families were too poor , " Jason said . I can fix that , Jason told himself . With donated materials and expert help , Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was for his own great-great-great aunt , Emma Eliza Butterfield , who was 9 when she died in 1875 . Jason enlisted his troop to paint 285 feet of fence at the cemetery . Thanks for the Idea , Mom Adam L. Baker of Troop 254 , Saegertown , Pa. , got his idea from his mother . When Adam was trying to find an Eagle project , his mother asked , " Why not make a guide to our town for new residents ? " Good idea , Adam thought . The result is a 10page booklet called the " Saegertown Area New Resident 's Guide . " It gives the names and phone numbers of local government officials , businesses and churches . It has a brief history of Saegertown and maps of the village and two adjoining townships . There is also information about utilities and recreational facilities . Adam worked for 35 hours , gathering information and putting it in a computer . " Other Scouts who have computers helped me gather information and put it on a hard disk I could use , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours on Adam 's project . Today a new resident of Saegertown can go to the public library and learn a lot about the town-thanks to Adam Baker . A Tip From the Local Council Christopher Rust , 18 , of Troop 64 , Fort Worth , Tex. , got his service project idea by asking his local BSA council service center . He was in luck , because David Chumchal of St. Teresa 's Children 's Home in Fort Worth had asked the council for help . Chumchal wanted a Scout to build seats at a campfire ring that another Scout had already made . Chris took the job . The campfire ring is in a wooded area on the home 's grounds . Chris built seating for 50 people using old utility poles donated by the electric company and planks from a lumberyard . " He did a really good job on it , " Chumchal said . It 's now the site for wiener roasts and nature studies by more than 75 young children and staff at the home . Chris had 50 hours of help from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luce of Troop 268 , Salt Lake City , got a tip from a friend of his father that HawkWatch International needed help . HawkWatch is a nonprofit organization promoting the conservation of eagles , hawks and other raptors . Steve Hoffman , HawkWatch president , told Claton he needed a huge cage-8 by 8 by 24 feet-to hold a golden eagle that had been injured in Nebraska . Claton built the cage with help from his troop . As it turned out , HawkWatch never got the eagle . But Claton 's cage has been used to house other birds of prey . Hoffman said , " Of all the Scouts and projects I 've worked with over the years , Claton 's was among the best . " Improving a City Park Scouts in Johnson City , Tenn. , have an easier time when they are seeking an Eagle project idea . They can go to Brad Jones , park ranger and naturalist at the city 's Winged Deer Park . He almost always has a big job for them . In the past few years , three Scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David Dennis led 13 Scouts in building and setting out 10 bluebird houses . " The bluebird population really has increased since then , " David said . Ranger Jones wanted bats as well as bluebirds at Winged Deer because each bat eats hundreds of insects every night . So Richard Heath led a Scout party that built and placed 12 bat boxes in the park 's trees . Another Troop 36 Scout , Greg Champney , completed the park 's trail loop . He led several Scouts in 75 boyhours of work to level a half-mile of trail and line it with landscaping timbers . " Now , " Greg said , " senior citizens and people who are not physically fit have a nature trail they can use . " Helping a Nonprofit Agency In Kingsport , Tenn. , Scoutmaster Charles Good knew that the RollerRuss Residence for Independent Living needed help . It is a nonprofit home for 10 people who have physical and mental disabilities . Three Scouts from his Troop 51 saved the home a lot of money with their Eagle projects . John Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a 150-foot-long wooden rail fence in the backyard to keep wheelchair users from tumbling down a steep embankment . And Howard Bennett built a ramp to help wheelchair users get outside in the first place . What Will Your Eagle Project Be ? Eagle project ideas are everywhere . Look around . Ask other people for ideas . Before you start , get a copy of the " Life to Eagle " packet , No. 18-927 , at your Scout council service center . You must use it as you develop your project .
