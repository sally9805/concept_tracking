Section : U.S. News The factors behind the nation 's acute shortage of affordable housing <p> In a political season certain to be remembered for its lack of clarifying visions and big ideas , it is still rather remarkable that the poor have been all but ignored during the months of bus tours , stump speeches and bunting-bedecked rallies . As the nation prepares to cast its ballots this week , in fact , a problem already convulsing the lives of the poorest Americans has barely been mentioned : the inability  --  even for those who are working  --  to afford basic shelter . <p> As late as 1970 , there were nearly a million more housing units available for poor people than there were poor people to occupy them . Today , however , market forces have combined with federal budget pressures and a history of government mismanagement to create an unparalleled and growing shortage of affordable housing . Some 5 million American households  --  2 million of them led by full-time wage earners  --  pay more than half their pretax income for housing . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utilities do not exceed 30 percent of pretax income . ) Of 11.2 million households classified as poor because they earn less than $12,000 a year , 4.7 million do n't have a decent place to live . <p> Behind the numbers is a dense welter of circumstances , some of them controversial among experts , many of them misunderstood by the general public , and nearly all of them involving the interaction of economic forces . Much of the affordable-housing stock of decades ago  --  shotgun shacks , shantytowns and rat-infested , cold-water flats  --  has succumbed to tougher housing codes , wrecking balls and gentrification . At the same time , the ranks of low-wage workers have been swelling and driving up demand for the very housing stock being destroyed . With more dollars chasing fewer housing units , rents have shot up . <p> In Washington , the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development , created in 1965 , attempted to cope with such trends by providing financing for construction of new housing units . In the glory days of the federal housing program in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , that has changed because of a decline in funding for public housing during the 1980s and because the housing issue has nearly vanished from national politics . <p> Better news . Not all the news is bad , however . Nonprofit organizations now use a creative mix of federal money , tax incentives and sometimes state , local and private dollars to construct hundreds of thousands of good housing units for low-income families . And under Secretary Henry Cisneros , HUD has channeled millions of dollars into nonprofits and beefed up technical assistance for project management . <p> On his watch , 14 times more homeless have been served than in prior administrations , 8,000 arrests have been made of tenants involved in drug dealing and other criminal acts in public-housing projects , and there has been aggressive intervention in troubled public-housing agencies like the Chicago Housing Authority . He has begun cleaning up the books of the long troubled Federal Housing Administration and made a priority of demolishing tens of thousands of high-crime public-housing high-rises . The goal is 100,000 such units by the year 2000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the number of needy households and affordable shelter growing , however , the demolition program has caused concern among tenants that HUD may be backing away from its commitment to maintain the more than 2 million units of assisted housing it created over the past 30 years . The demolition plan was born of a worthy ideal : to get poor people out of the crime-infested high-rises and into smaller , attractive garden-apartment-style complexes . That 's an improvement , but because the newer units are more expensive , tenants worry , it may also mean exchanging more units for fewer . In Seattle , 871 units at a project known as Holly Park are being destroyed ; only 400 new low-income units will be built in their place . In Chicago , the symbol of so many failures of public housing , HUD awarded the city $122 million to tear down 11 high-rises , create some replacement housing and relocate tenants . HUD has promised that all 1,096 families affected will receive new housing . But many residents fear HUD wo n't follow through . <p> New units . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the 100,000 units to be destroyed , they point out , 40,000 will be offset by new apartments to be built . The rest will be made up for by rent vouchers , which Cisneros believes are the most efficient means of resolving the current housing-affordability crisis . Moreover , because many of the units slated for demolition are unoccupied , Cisneros says , HUD will actually create more housing units than are destroyed . <p> The other half of HUD 's subsidized-housing effort in the private sector seems in more dire condition . Private landlords collect HUD subsidies through " Section 8 " rent-subsidy certificates , low-interest mortgages and mortgage insurance from the FHA . But now there 's a landlord crisis looming . In the 1970s and 1980s , about 8,600 buildings , with 700,000 units , were created with FHA mortgage insurance . But HUD was in such a hurry to get the units built that construction costs got out of hand and rents escalated . Section 8 subsidies were granted to make rents more affordable , but sometimes they went to support above-market rents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for renewal , and if nothing is done , HUD could be responsible for tens of millions of additional dollars in high-rent subsidies over the next few years . That 's not certain , though : HUD officials say their proposal to bring higher rents into line with prevailing market rates  --  the " mark to market " program  --  while reducing subsidies through sales of troubled properties to the private sector could mean that the agency will save money in the years ahead . <p> What makes tenants fearful is that Section 8 subsidies would not be continued for the buildings they live in once HUD contracts expire . Officials of the housing agency say the worries are unfounded . They have proposed that all displaced tenants get rent vouchers . HUD maintains the rate of landlord acceptance is 82 percent nationwide . <p> Many in assisted housing are n't so sure . Michelle Saunders and Cathy Chancy are the tenant leaders in the Gladys Hampton House on 129th Street across from Morningside Park in New York 's Harlem . Saunders and Chancy have lived at Gladys Hampton since soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in vouchers . " Not many places will accept them , " Chancy says . " I am firmly , firmly against them because so many people are in bad financial straits . " The sentiment is widespread among tenants . " Our concern about vouchering out public housing is that landlords are hesitant to take low-income people , " says Joleen Colombo of the Housing Authority of Portland in Oregon . <p> There is another big landlord problem just over the horizon . About 3,300 buildings , with some 350,000 low-rent units , were built under a law permitting owners to prepay their HUD-financed mortgages after 20 years . This year , after a long delay imposed by Congress , that has begun to happen . Once the mortgages are paid off , building owners will be under no obligation to rent their apartments to the poor . Owners of 60,000 units have already filed to prepay , and there is only enough money to preserve 9,000 units under current appropriations . Again , HUD says the concerns are misplaced . Residents of buildings sold , Cisneros says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will receive enhanced rent subsidies but only if they remain in their current apartments . <p> Underlying the debate over HUD policies and their real and perceived consequences is a long pattern of management failures . HUD remains the only cabinet-level agency designated as " high risk " by the General Accounting Office , a congressional watchdog agency , because HUD 's problems are " especially vulnerable to waste , fraud , abuse and mismanagement . " Cisneros receives generally high marks for trying to reform the agency , but he concedes there is still much to do . <p> Mismanagement . The problems come in different shapes and sizes . One has to do with a relatively small operation known as 203(k) , a mortgage-insurance program that the Cisneros team is promoting aggressively . Over the past decade , HUD has used 203(k) to insure $1.6 billion in loans for the purchase and rehabilitation of 22,953 single-family properties . A recent review by the HUD inspector general found that " the program design encourages risky property deals , land-sale schemes , overstated property appraisals and phony or excessive fees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . <p> But troubling issues of money management still plague the housing agency , which handles on average 62,500 financial transactions a month . HUD officials acknowledge that the agency makes about $290 million in " excess annual subsidy payments , " or about $90 per subsidy per year . That 's a potent target for critics . <p> Under Cisneros , the housing agency has been trying to come to terms with its management problems by consolidating and streamlining programs . It has also cut staff from 13,600 to 10,400 , with a target of 7,500 full-time employees . Judy England-Joseph , lead HUD watcher at the General Accounting Office , says HUD has " been very aggressive in trying to refocus priorities to the customer , but fundamental issues still deal with very poor systems on which to make financial and management decisions . " <p> HUD officials respond that they can make some major fixes administratively , as they did with FHA 's troubled mortgage loans . But Congress has to sign off on others , and on Capitol Hill there is no surfeit of confidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Christopher Bond , the Missouri Republican who is one of the Senate 's most knowledgeable members on housing policy , " they have a new program that does n't relate directly to assuring there 's good , affordable , safe housing . But it 's a grand new program going someplace . " <p> Congress has pushed some initiatives at the housing agency , but it has blocked others . In the last three budgets , members rejected administration proposals for up to 50,000 new tenant vouchers a year . Next year , Congress will face major decisions on restructuring federal housing policy . <p> However that turns out , there are several bright spots in this otherwise bleak tableau . One is the performance of some local governments . Some cities and states have passed special taxes or bond issues to fund low-income housing , though not enough to meet the need in most cases . Florida , for example , levies a 20-cent tax on each $100 of value of property sold . This has generated $79 million over the past two years toward production of about 16,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-growing state with so many low-wage jobs . <p> Nonprofit organizations offer even more hope . New York 's East Harlem helps illustrate why . On East 105th Street , a solid rectangular apartment building with newly planted trees houses 101 elderly people . A few blocks away , on East 106th Street , fresh paint and new windows mark the apartment building as recently rehabilitated . More new paint and a sign , " Affordable Housing for New Yorkers , " decorate a narrow building on 117th Street . The three buildings are the handiwork of Hope Community , which gets its funding from a complicated mix of HUD 's Home Program , Community Development Block Grants , low-income-housing tax credits , city money and other sources . Executive Director Mark Alexander describes an endless maze of arcane regulations  --  some imposed by Congress to prevent waste and abuse . Whatever their intent , Alexander says it took him three years to win approval to build a housing project for the elderly . " The housing industry needs a few programs that are consistent and stable , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Limited resources . Even so , there 's only so much a more streamlined federal housing agency can accomplish working through local governments and nonprofits . Daniel Leibsohn , president of the Low Income Housing Fund in San Francisco , has provided loans for nearly 15,000 units of nonprofit low-income housing since 1984 . " I think nonprofits could do more housing , but only up to a point with existing resources , " he says . " I think it 's a longer-term project of trying to build up nonprofits . " <p> There are no magic fixes , but any solution involves more money . Leibsohn would provide more attractive subsidies in order to involve more private developers . They could receive support to build turnkey projects , for example , to be handed over to tenants or nonprofits to manage . Kathryn Wylde , who recently left her longtime position as president of the New York City Housing Partnership , which created and renovated 15,000 units in New York City , believes that the federal government has to play a continued role but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York City ca n't begin to address the needs of the people here , " Wylde says . " We have to have federal participation and federal funding for these needs . " <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Houston .

Chyleen Creyer and her daughter , Michaela , live in good public housing in suburban Seattle , but she worries that if the Section 8 contract is not renewed , she 'll be forced onto the street <p> By Penny Loeb , Warren Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman <p> Conversation HOUSING POLICY ' IS NOT SIMPLE ' <p> Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros spoke with U.S. News reporters Penny Loeb and Timothy M. Ito in his office last week . Highlights : <p> How to fill the housing gap . The single most important thing I would do would be to ask for the requisite level of Section 8 funding . I think that that is the best program for housing .... Clearly , it is a fraction of the total need . We 've always been behind as a country in trying to meet that gap . The last several years , I think as a country we 've fallen farther behind because the economy pushed so many families towards lower incomes . <p> What about vouchers ? The policy on vouchers is that once you have a voucher , you have it for as long as you need it . It is as definite , as reliable , as hard units of public housing . In some ways , it is more reliable than hard units of public housing because the Congress has never cut and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove vouchers from people who have them . But they have imposed slow death on public-housing developments by not funding modernization . <p> Is tenant oversight workable ? It 's a good idea . And we 've tried it . Certainly on the public-housing side , we 've spent substantial resources on tenant organization and training . And I think we can do a better job on the assisted-housing side .... Developing working relationships with residents , where they have a greater role in helping us identify troubled buildings , is a good idea . <p> And HUD 's historical problems ? I 'm going to just say it : We 've busted our ass for four years here every way we know how to try to improve the management , and GAO still wants to call it a high risk agency .... These are very intricate programs and they may well be high risk by a layman 's definition ... I wish the world were so simple that you could say , ' Well , by next week , we 're going to be off of it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be doing it . ' But the world is not simple . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Secretary . Even after four years of reform , there is still much to be accomplished <p>
