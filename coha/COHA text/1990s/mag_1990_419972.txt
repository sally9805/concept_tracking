Section : IN DEPTH PUBLIC LANDS <p> The Forest Service , 85-year-old child of Teddy Roosevelt and GiffordPinchot , is entering the environmental decade shaken and penitent . But is it contrite enough to change ? <p> In January 1989 a timber-sales planner for Oregon 's Willamette National Forest , Jeff DeBonis , sent a letter to his boss , U.S. Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson <p> " We are overcutting our national forests , " wrote DeBonis . " We are incurring negative , cumulative impacts to our watersheds , fisheries , and wildlife in our quest to meet our timber targets . " That same winter DeBonis announced the formation of the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics , whose purpose would be to push for reforms in the agency . Within a year more than 1,500 of the Forest Service 's 39,000 employees had joined . <p> That summer , James Torrence , retiring after three years as head of the Forest Service 's Northwest region , told a Seattle newspaper that too much timber was being cut from Northwest forests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region 's draft forest plans would cause degradation , he said . <p> By the end of 1989 forest supervisors in the Rocky Mountain region had sent Chief Robertson two memos with similar messages . " Past and present forest practices do not meet the high-quality land management expectations of the public and our employees , " one of the memos read . " There is a growing concern that we have become an organization out of control . " <p> Calls for change are buffeting the U. S. Forest Service . Veteran foresters of the timber-first school are retiring , and they 're being replaced by hydrologists , biologists , and other scientists and technicians who speak a different language . Talk of board feet and harvest levels must now compete with discussions of biological diversity and ecological sensitivity . The new crew is challenging the prevailing practice of clearcutting , which has been called the most devastating system of forestry ever devised , and proposing less-ruinous techniques . And Chief Robertson has embraced a program called New Perspectives , intended to " maintain more of the ecological values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs for natural resources . " <p> Bold as these words may sound , many forests have yet to feel the difference . " The talk has n't hit the ground yet , " says DeBonis , who recently quit the Forest Service to devote more time to his association . <p> Rick Johnson , associate Northwest representative for the Sierra Club , believes the Forest Service has a problem of leadership . " We have glasnost coming up from within the ranks of the agency , " he says , " but as vet no Gorbachev . " <p> Turning from the highest administrators to the managers of individual forests , environmentalists see some encouraging signs : Tom Kovalicky , supervisor of the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho , has won awards from conservation groups for shifting his forest away from what he calls the " insanity of the past , cutting trees down at any cost . " He has limited clearcutting to a quarter of his forest , protected rivers and fisheries from erosion , and involved the public in the forest-planning process . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed by Republican Senator James McClure . As Sierra Club lobbyist Jim Blomquist puts it , McClure " has a bullet with Kovalicky 's name on it . " Bill Morden , supervisor of the Idaho Panhandle National Forest , has instructed his staff to look at alternatives to clearcutting . " The time is right to treat the forest with a lighter hand , " he says . " If we do n't do something creative and constructive , we wo n't have any timber left to manage . " New plans for the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming call for a 29 percent timber-cut reduction to meet " wildlife and recreation objectives , " says staff officer Larry Warren . Tennessee 's Cherokee National Forest plans to reduce clearcutting by 30 percent . " It probably would have been a higher reduction , " admits staff officer Mike Murphy , " except for very strong timber interests . " In California , Regional Forester Paul Barker has announced that " in response to public concerns , " clearcutting may be reduced to about 30 percent of timber sales over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to our forests , however , is uncertain . " They can leave two or three trees an acre and say that it 's not a clearcut , " says DeBonis , " when it 's really not much different . " And even though the Forest Service says it is eschewing clearcutting , it is turning to logging practices that still result in forests with trees that are all about the same age . Such " even-aged " management eliminates much of a forest 's native flora and fauna . What 's needed , many critics say , is " selection " management , where only individual trees or small groups of trees are logged . <p> One management system that encourages forests with trees of varying ages is gaining adherents , especially among foresters in the Pacific Northwest . Although it is called the " new forestry , " many of its practices are similar to those used in national forests before the 1960s , when clearcutting and slash burning became the norm . Its principles include leaving live trees and dead snags for wildlife , and downed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearcuts ( instead of dispersing them evenly through the forests ) to minimize fragmentation of the remaining oldgrowth groves ; cutting less frequently ( at intervals of up to 350 years in the Pacific Northwest , for instance , instead of the previous 60- to 80-year cycles ) ; and leaving wider buffer zones along streams to protect fish and wildlife habitat . <p> The new forestry rejects the practice of setting aside certain lands for logging and other areas for wildlife and recreation . " We must learn to share the sandbox , " says Forest Service researcher Jerry Franklin , one of the chief architects of the system . <p> Others , however , think there 's not enough sandbox left . " The new forestry is certainly not a substitute for preservation , " says the Sierra Club 's Johnson . <p> " It 's too little too late , " says DeBonis . " It would have worked if they 'd done it 50 years ago , but now we need all uncut Forest Service land for gene pools and wildlife corridors . I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The concern with biological diversity , a concept almost unheard of in the Forest Service until recently , underlies the agency 's New Perspectives program . The idea , explains program director Hal Salwasser , is to look at management plans in terms of ecosystems rather than individual forests . In the Yellowstone region , for example , the Forest Service and the National Park Service are working with three states , 12 counties , and citizen and industry groups to formulate long-range plans for an 11.7-million-acre area . The Forest Service is leading a similar study in the Rocky Mountain region , which contains 12 national forests . <p> The New Perspectives program is also at work in southern Oregon 's Siskiyou National Forest , where citizens are part of a planning process that looks at 20,000-acre chunks of public land . " We 're not doing any clearcutting , " says Siskiyou public-affairs officer Warren Olney . " We 're leaving some or all of the old Douglas firs and , for biodiversity , a selection of other tree species  --  a ' multi-culture ' rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we 're trying to maintain healthy ecosystems , rebuilding forests with two or three age classes , imitating the way a wildfire would leave them . We 'll learn from these demonstration areas , and get the information out to other forests . I hope that 100 percent of the national forests will be making similar efforts in three years . " <p> But change has been slow so far . Many of the ecological principles of the New Perspectives program , he admits , were set forth in the 1976 National Forest Management Act . They were n't implemented then for the same reason they 're likely to encounter roadblocks now . As Salwasser diplomatically puts it , " If you decide you 're going to maintain the ecological structure of a given area , the obvious implication is that less timber can be taken from it . " <p> And there 's the rub . If Congress keeps timber quotas at the high levels set during the Reagan years , the forests will continue to suffer . " Industry captured the process , " says DeBonis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old growth , so they could fully amortize their old mills before switching over to second-growth technology . The senators for the big timber states , such as Hatfield of Oregon and McClure of Idaho , took charge , and the rest of Congress , which sees the Forest Service as only a blip in a huge government , followed . But now people are realizing what 's happening to our forests . They 're starting to write their members of Congress , and the power is shifting . " <p> In recent years the Sierra Club and other conservation groups have lobbied for reducing both the agency 's quotas and its road-building budget . They have not made much progress , however , because timber brings home the agency 's bacon . Even projects such as wildlife-habitat improvement are funded with money from timber sales . <p> " The Forest Service can change , " says Randal O'Toole , an economist who works for an Oregon-based forestry group called Cascade Holistic Economic Consultants . " But as long as the incentives stay the same , the changes wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reforming the Forest Service ( Island Press , 1988 ) , favors financing the agency through fees paid by all users , including loggers , miners , hunters , hikers , and anglers . Under this system , O'Toole reasons , forest officials would n't have the same incentive to log . They could be rewarded instead for building trails , protecting wildlife habitat , or restoring rivers . <p> O'Toole 's are n't the only revolutionary ideas being tossed about . The Dallas-based Forest Reform Network is pushing a bill to ban clearcuts on most national-forest land . The National Audubon Society 's Brock Evans has proposed putting some Forest Service lands into a separate " U.S. Logging Agency " and giving the rest  --  all lands important for their wilderness , wildlife , or recreation values  --  to " an agency interested in protecting them  --  perhaps the National Park Service . " <p> The Sierra Club is focused on more local efforts  --  trying to ensure that laws are enforced in individual forests and trying to win wilderness , park , or other protective designations for significant areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to changing the forestry laws again , " lobbyist Blomquist says . " The National Forest Management Act battle was fought in the 1970s , and if we reopened the process I doubt that we 'd get a better law . Besides , with most laws , what 's crucial is who administers them . An agency full of environmentally minded people means more protection for the forest than any rewrite of the laws . " <p> Robertson , for his part , has said that the Forest Service is trying to make more changes faster than at any time in his career . " The chief has recognized that harvest levels need to come down , " says Len Carey , spokesman for the chief 's office . " He has also instructed the Forest Service to look at alternatives to clearcutting , including the new forestry techniques . But it takes time to make a lot of changes . " <p> Meanwhile , our national forests continue to fall at near-record rates . " The discouraging thing for people in the agency , especially biologists , is that day-to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody 's milling around the starting line , but nobody wants to start the race .
