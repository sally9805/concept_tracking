THE CHILDREN ARE FIDGETING AND FRETTING SO , I feel I may lose my temper any minute . I pray to the Lord to grant me strength of body and spirit , so that we may safely reach the conclusion of our journey . Dennis has been dead two weeks now , and I fear for the baby as well . She is running a temperature of a hundred and three point six . Today I saw seven grave markers , two small ones where a baby or child must lie . wept with sadness thinking of how their poor mothers must grieve for them . Also , I think there 's something the matter with this wagon . Its front wheel makes a funny sound whenever we turn . <p> I pretend not to hear my mother , who 's saying my name in that way she has , like even though her sentence is only one word long- " Justine ? " " Justine ? " - by the time she 's gotten to the end of it , she 's lost her train of thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to stretch her leg . I picture her burning up with fever . <p> " Justine ? " Mom says again . Rona 's watching Mom 's eyes in the rear-view mirror , getting ready to kick me again . <p> " My name is Zebulina , " I say . Rona lets out a spraying sound . <p> " What , honey ? " Mom says , but I do n't answer . " Is there a gas station down there ? Out your side ? " <p> There is nothing , as far as the eye can see . A lone tree , on top of a bluff-I give it a name : Hardship Bluff . If the baby dies , that 's where I will bury it . I 'm not really sure what a bluff is , but the word has a lonely sound ; it sounds the way a word would sound if you said it and there was no one around to hear it , no solid object to echo it back . <p> This morning after breakfast Mom came in our room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " She gave me some clothes I 'd never seen before-a maroon corduroy dress , black tights with tiny flowers on them , and black velvet shoes . Rona got a different dress out of the same material , and the same tights and shoes . " These shoes are stupid , " Rona said and I wished she 'd shut up , because it was Saturday , and early , still , and Mom 's face was still okay . Mom does n't know I watch it all the time , the way you 'd watch the sky on a threatening day if you had to travel a long way and hoped to get where you were going before the storm hit . <p> " Where are we going ? " I asked . <p> " On a picnic ! " Mom said brightly , as if we had n't just had breakfast , and as if it was n't almost winter , and a little too cold for sitting on the ground outside . If we were still in California , it would n't be strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach-and stay out all day if we wanted . The trunk of our car there was packed with a bunch of stuff that stayed in it all the time-blankets and sweatshirts , boogie boards , sandcastle stuff for Rona , even a little grill . What I liked most about that car was the way the trunk looked : like a little black-carpeted room with our things nestled inside , its little light that lighted up when you opened it , the grains of sand , which I thought of as little pieces of everywhere we had been-pieces of good days - all over everything . <p> I hated giving that car back , emptying out our things and vaccuuming the trunk . We drove out here in a big truck and I was so mad at Mom the whole trip . The way she acted all sad when we were leaving , like she did n't want to go but there was nothing she could do about it . But when I 'd look at her behind the wheel of the truck , steering with two hands and barrelling along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing what she was doing . She did n't sound like it , either , acting all cheery , trying to get us to play stupid car games , stopping all the time to buy us a bunch of junk so we 'd be happy and not fight , even though there was n't enough money for the trip in the first place . <p> Also , she said something when we were driving . It was really hot inside the truck and we were going up a long hill and the truck was making an awful noise . Rona was whining and saying she was hungry , but Mom was just humming to the radio . " Ca n't we stop and get something to drink ? " I asked Mom , but she pretended not to hear . <p> " It 's like being a pioneer , " she said . " Traveling across the country all day with no food or water . " <p> That was before we studied the pioneers in school , so I did n't answer her like I would now : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers were n't stupid . They did n't just get in some crappy wagon and set out across the country with their kids and animals and no food and water like , Oh , we 'll see what happens . They would prepare for up to a year , collecting tools and clothes , preserving food , saving money , choosing what to bring and what to leave , saying goodbye to their friends and families . And if they did run out of food and water on the trail , they would n't act like it was some fun adventure . The thing Mom said reminds me of what the boys in my new school are like : how when Ms. Taylor said we had to keep a pioneer child diary none of them could just be a normal person-they all had to be in the Donner Party , writing about some new dire circumstance every day , like having to eat their dog or the mother boiling the family 's shoes into soup . <p> The other thing Mom got wrong was-duh-we were going the wrong way . West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards . Mom said we were going to New England , and she made it sound like it was all green trees and colored leaves , people making their own syrup and cheese and living in old-fashioned houses . She said we could ice skate and jump in leaf piles and go to a place where people dressed up like pilgrims and you could watch them spin wool and churn butter and make candles . But it turned out to be like a lot of Mom 's plans-either she was lying , or the picture she had was wrong . It was like if you set off for a trip with a picture in your hands , instead of a map , and your plan was to travel till you found the place in the picture , but then when you never did , you just stopped where you 'd ended up and pretended you did n't notice that it was completely different from the place you had been looking for . <p> When we got to New England the sky was gray and there were n't any leaves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in , we had to stay in the basement of Mom 's friend Marie 's for two months . And we did n't do any of the things she promised , either-the ice skating , the leaf-piles or the pilgrim village-because of three reasons : one , Mom works all the time , just like in California , only now when she 's not working she just wants to sleep ; two , our crappy car , which Marie and her husband Bill gave us , probably so Mom would n't go anywhere too far away because she babysits their retarded baby all the time ; and the third reason , of course , no money . <p> After a while I figured out the real reason we moved here - it was because Danny Martone lived in Hartford , Connecticut and Mom probably wanted to be his girlfriend or something . Sometimes the pioneer men would leave the family and go to California or Oregon to get a job or start a farm and then the wife and kids would come meet them , but this was n't anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife and kids to come , not just some dumb smelly guitar player who never had any food in the house except a bunch of fake beer while Mom made us go down there . It was so boring and his house smelled so bad , and the worst thing was , Mom would start cleaning it for him , and smiling and laughing like she liked being his slave , and then she 'd get mad at Rona and me , but not at him , for not helping . Actually , Danny was n't always that bad ; I liked it when he 'd throw me around or teach me to play something on his guitar , which was really loud and made Rona cry . But after a while we did n't go down there anymore . I asked Mom about it once , but I could tell from her answer it was a ledge , so I tried to make her think about something else instead . <p> A ledge is something I made up about Mom a long time ago , when I was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom liked someone , she 'd get so happy . We 'd get really busy , too : calling , leaving messages , driving past his house to learn his schedule and habits . <p> " Come on , " Mom would say sometimes , even if it was really late at night , and we 'd go to Kinko 's , and she would arrange the things she 'd brought-cut out words , pictures , dried flowers , whole pages from her red book-on the glass , while Rona and I would make copies of our hands and faces to keep from being bored . <p> Besides the pages , we 'd make soup and bread and cookies ; we 'd make music tapes of the weird groups Mom liked ; we 'd find out their birthdays , what kinds of books and magazines they read , what kinds of cigarettes they smoked , and go out shopping . That was the thing about the ledge . Everything we did felt like building a big mountain-that 's the way I pictured it . Like we were walking round and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowers and rocks and dirt-when Mom was happy , it felt like we could build a shape as big as a world out of the flatness . All we had to do was keep climbing up , and keep laying little pieces down , and keep having a good time and not stop . But the same thing always happened . After a while there was nothing left to do . We had made all the soup and sent all the letters and left all the funny messages and there was nothing left to add , and then the mountain would begin to crumble . Pieces of its sides would fall right off , as if it was n't a very good place we had made at all , and Rona and I would slide down , but Mom would still be up there at the top , waiting , and every time something happened , like if we saw him downtown and he was with someone else , the place where she was standing would get a little smaller , and even though it was just a made-up picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me afraid to look at her , as if she really could start tumbling and falling , even though she was standing right next to me . <p> Today we gathered around the fire after supper and prayed to God to deliver us safely to our destination . Dennis has been dead two and a half weeks . The baby is still doing poorly . I made an onion poultice for her chest , though we can little spare the onion . We had onions for breakfast , dinner and supper again . Little Annabelle Amanda and little Ezekiel Obadiah asked me again why god took their papa , why he sends us only onions to eat , why he makes the baby sick . Sometimes I do n't know what to tell them . Sometimes I think god 's just a little overwhelmed trying to run the universe , but I ca n't tell them that . You know how children like to think somebody 's in charge . <p> I did n't turn in my diary on Monday because Ms. Taylor said it had to be a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's point of view is supposed to be like : this thing happened , that thing happened , I do n't understand it . That 's why she likes the boys ' diaries , all that gross , faky stuff with all the reasons left out . <p> What I think is that inside children there 's actually an adult . Not a real adult , but sort of the seed of the one you 're going to turn out to be , and that 's why you can always figure out the reasons for things happening , and figure out the right things to do , if you think hard enough . <p> However , I suppose Ms. Taylor thinks that 's boring . I suppose she thinks it 's more interesting to read about someone 's head burning off from scarlet fever , or how their dog tasted surprisingly like Kentucky Fried Chicken , which was n't even invented at the time , obviously . Alex Brennan wrote that . He 's so queer . The other day he dropped a pencil by my feet on purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it , but he was really trying to look up my dress . Kevin , Noah and Joey P. were watching him and laughing , but Ms. Taylor did n't even notice . In the gym they had an assembly on sexual harassment , which is what crawling on the floor looking up people 's dresses is , but it was stupid . It was the same as the " changing bodies " talk-the boys sat on one side and made sick jokes and cracked up every time Miss Weintraub said a dirty word and the girls sat on the other and giggled and got made a total fool of . It was like Miss Weintraub just stood up there telling all your secrets-how you 're going to get your period any day and now your body 's this gross thing you have to be careful not to let anyone touch in a bad way or make jokes about or date-rape . <p> The snow is beginning to fall . All day long , thick flakes fell lightly , and the children ran alongside , playing in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't expect snow so soon . Dennis told me we had a month left , at least . I 'm praying to god , as usual . I do n't know how long it 's going to last . The sky looks full of snow . I wonder if it 's snowing all the way from here to California . <p> " Come on , you guys , hurry up , " Mom said . <p> " Why do we have to dress up for a picnic ? " Rona asked , but Mom was already gone in her room . When she came back she was in a dress too . It was made out of the same material as ours , and it gave me a creepy feeling , and even though Rona 's such a pain , I felt sorry for her . I do n't know why . She was sort of thrilled about the dresses-she and Mom held hands and twirled , and Mom picked her up for a minute and gave her a big hug . <p> Ms. Taylor asked me for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail the unit if I did n't turn it in , so I wrote a fake one when I got home from school , while Rona and I were watching General Hospital . It was about a girl named Hecate Lorelei and I let Rona make up all the stories in it : Hecate Lorelei and her little brother fight about who gets to sit on the horse , Hecate Lorelei loses her rag doll in the river . I put in dates and places from the chapter in our book : July 21st , 1851 , Platte River ; August 23rd , 1851 , South Pass and so on . Ms. Taylor likes it if you show everything going in a straight line and all in the right order , even though if you tried to draw a picture of a real life-ours , at least : all the different things that happened , the places we went and the places we left-it would make a big messy shape , like a jagged star , on the map . <p> The snow fell through the night and now covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They do n't know , yet , to be afraid . We have n't seen anybody , ahead of us or behind , in five days . If the baby dies here , I wo n't be able to dig her a grave ; the ground is frozen hard as granite . Maybe we should turn back . I did n't pray today . I listened to the wind howl instead and tried to think . I 've decided we 're going to stay here until I think of what to do . <p> " Where are we going ? " Rona asked , but Mom did n't answer . She was putting a black velvet ribbon around my ponytail . Rona got a black velvet headband . <p> " Where did we get these dresses ? " asked Rona . We are n't supposed to ask questions like that-they make Mom upset , because they 're about money . Mom did n't make up the rule about not asking , I did . I 'm trying to teach Rona , but she does n't even try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young , she does n't remember that there was a time before . Mom the way she is now is just Regular Mom to Rona , but I can remember Mom Before . Mom Before swam in the ocean , and smiled , and had friends over to barbecue and play music and sing , and when there was n't money , she made rice and beans , which was my favorite dinner anyway , or took us over to Grandma Bobbie 's , before Grandma Bobbie started hating Dennis and calling him The Jesus Freak . Mom Before was sometimes okay for a whole day at a time , even if I forgot to worry about her . <p> I fear I may never see my dear mother again . Looking out at the snow yesterday made me think about my mother 's lace curtains ; for a moment I thought I was in my mother 's dark sitting room , looking through the whiteness into more whiteness beyond . She told me not to marry Dennis , she told me not to leave home for such a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , she told me . The baby 's too young to travel . <p> Once she asked me , " Where have you hidden your heart , Zebulina ? Why does it never make itself known ? " <p> " You know what you used to love , Zebul ina ? " my mother also said that day . <p> " You used to love yourself , " she told me . " When you were a little baby the sound of your own laugh used to make you wriggle around with delight ; the sight of yourself when I held you up to the looking glass used to make you smile . " <p> Alex Brennan called me a name yesterday . I do n't know what it meant , but I know it was something disgusting because all the boys laughed that way they do- " Whoaho ! " - like when Miss Weintraub showed the pictures of the male and female reproductive track . <p> I do n't know why they hate me . One day when I walked by , Joey P. picked up two spots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and said " Any recent developments , Justine ? " Which I do n't have anyway . They laughed , of course , and it made me really sad . I ca n't explain it , but this is what it made me think about : when I was little , I used to take baths with Mom , like Rona does now . Mom would be lying back in the water , and I used to love the way her breasts looked , all soft and round on top of her . There would be a little pool of water right between them , in that sort-of hollow place , like a puddle after a rain storm , and I used to love to put my face right in it and laugh , which would make Mom laugh too . You know how little kids are : if something 's fun , they want to do it over and over again until someone tells them to stop . Mom would n't make me stop , though-we would just loll around till the water got chilly , and laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I did n't make the mistake of telling Mom about the name Alex called me . The day I told her what Joey said , about me growing breasts when I was n't , she burst into tears , even though I was the one who felt like crying . I did n't like the way things felt all switched around : I did n't think it was what Joey said to me that was making her cry-I did n't think it was about me having breasts or not having them , or the fact that the boys were idiotic , and my life was n't even a little bit good anymore like it sometimes was in California , and that I did n't have any friends . I think it was her own reasons she was crying about . I think it was because she hated work , and she did n't make enough money , and if Rona or I got sick she had to have a babysitter and then she did n't make any money at all . And it was also probably because she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did have one , that probably would have made her cry , too , and because the car Marie and Bill gave us had started making weird , smelly smoke , and Rona had just flushed David the Gnome down the toilet " on accident , " and it cost three hundred dollars to get him out . <p> My Dear Mother , <p> You will probably never receive this letter-most likely it will be buried here with us in the snow . I will tuck it in the bodice of my dress , where , if we 're found , someone may think to look . A strange thought-my most private places gazed upon by strangers . <p> I always meant to ask , Mother : what did you mean when you said I used to love myself ? Even though I know it is n't true , sometimes I find myself thinking , if I just knew what you meant , if I could just remember , maybe somehow I could save us now . <p> One thing I want to tell you : it was n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the children into the wilderness , that we sit , huddled in the snow in the mountains , lost , alone and preparing to die . just want you to know , it was n't for his sake . I ca n't remember what my reasons were , but if I think hard enough , I know it will come to me . I also want you to know , it was n't because I did n't love you enough . You were a wise and fine mother to me . <p> The children are asleep now . We will survive this night , but I 'm not sure how many more . Maybe the snow will stop . Maybe it will continue . We have food for a couple of weeks . Maybe someone will come along . <p> The direction Mom drives is n't anywhere we 've been on a picnic before . Rona 's gotten sick of asking where we 're going , so she just sits there , trying to think of ways to bother me . Sometimes I do n't hate Rona so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does n't know I 'm watching her . She sticks two fingers in her mouth and rubs the tiny bald spot where she twirled all the hair away . When I was Rona 's age I had a stomachache every day . Every night at eleven o'clock I sat up in bed and threw up . That was back when Dennis was still around and it 's one of the reasons he left . No one told me that , but I figured it out : my throwing up was one of the things that made Mom cry and feel like her life was horrible , which made Dennis mad . The Lord helps those who help themselves , he used to yell , sometimes , in the middle of the night . <p> When I finally figure out where we 're going on our picnic , I get a bad feeling . There 's nothing wrong with the spot , exactly . It 's sort of like a park but it 's not a parkjust a big triangle of grass with a few benches and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads is a bank and some other buildings and a Store 24 . <p> " Let 's sit here , " Mom says , in a weird , tinkly voice , like she 's trying to make it sound like such a good idea and so much fun . I do n't care where we sit . I ask her if I can go to the Store 24 , but she says , " Not now . Later you can . You can get anything you want . " <p> Sometimes I feel like I can see sideways into Mom . Like what you 're supposed to do is look straight at her , and believe her when she says this is going to be so fun , that 's going to be so great , we 're going to visit Danny , we 're going to Marie 's , we 're going to drive to Cape Cod for the weekend , we 're going to have really great birthday parties at Skate City , etcetera , etcetera . But if you 're looking from a slightly different angle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that it 's not really like that at all . Everything 's not great , and behind the part of Mom you 're supposed to see , there 's this big hollow space , and it gives you a bad feeling , like when you pick up something that 's supposed to be heavy , but it 's light instead , like a pod or a dead bug with its insides dried away , or a really cheap toy . <p> " Come here , " Mom says to Rona , and she makes her turn around while she straightens the bow on the back of her dress . " Your hair ribbon 's untied , " she says to me . The blanket she 's put down on the grass is the one from our couch , that Great-aunt Helen made . Rona and I are n't allowed to eat food when we 're sitting underneath it at home . I have a stomachache . <p> " Let 's go play , " says Rona , but I close my eyes and lean forward so my forehead is touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mom says to Rona . " Come back when I call you . " <p> I have a note in my backpack , from Ms. Taylor . I was supposed to give it to Mom but I did n't . The note is all taped up but I know what it says . It says that I have some problem , that I 'm rude , and a liar , because of what happened on Thursday . Ms. Taylor called me up before recess . The day before , I handed in my pioneer diaries-both of them : the kid one , which was really short and boring , and the real one , The Story of Zebulina Partridge , which was on her desk when I went up . I thought she was going to tell me it was good . But all she said was , " Is everything all right , Justine ? " When I said " What do you mean ? " she said , " Well , there are some sort of odd things in here . " <p> " It 's all true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . <p> " What 's true ? " Ms. Taylor said . <p> " The Story of Zebulina Partridge , " I answered . " She was a real person . " <p> " Really , " said Ms. Taylor , the way people say it sometimes , like a question and its answer coming out at the same time . It means they do n't believe you . <p> " She was my relative , " I said . " She was my great-greatgreat grandmother and she came from Scotland and she went across the country alone with her children in a wagon and got caught in a snow storm and they all . . . " I stopped because I realized if she was my grandmother , they could n't all die in the mountains . Ms. Taylor was looking at me as if she did n't believe me and it suddenly made me mad . Why was she so sure I did n't have an ancestor who did those things ? <p> " So what happened to her ? " Ms. Taylor asked . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is what I said . <p> " Let 's have our picnic now . Are you hungry , girls ? " Mom says to me . Rona is still off playing under the tree . I 'm not hungry , but Mom 's laying out the food . It 's all stuff from the store where she works-smelly cheese and thin crackers with weird seeds in them and pate and water in fancy bottles . For Christmas I got tea in my stocking , and candies in little metal boxes , and a jar of olives . " Justine likes those kinds of things , " she told some friends who came over and said , Are n't those unusual things for a child to get in her Christmas stocking . I did n't say anything , but it made me feel bad-it made me remember when I was little like Rona and Mom did know what I liked : stickers , ponies , the Care Bears , grilled cheese , and how sometimes Mom would pull me on to her lap for no reason , like when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my hair , take out my ponytail and put it back in again . <p> I would n't want to be Rona , because she 's still so little , and she depends on Mom for everything . She 's like one of those eggs the sixth-graders have to carry around , to teach them about responsibility . But still , sometimes , like when I opened my Christmas stocking and saw what was in it , I wished for a minute that I was her . It 's not that she got better stuff ; she got the same as me . But the difference is , she did n't ask why . She still believes in Santa Claus-Mom made me promise not to say anything to her , and I guess in Rona 's brain everything just makes sense somehow . Like , Santa went shopping at Akers ' Country Deli this year , that explains it . I remember when things felt like that to me : when my brain made everything into a nice , closing shape-smooth circles with no openings for weird stuff to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I hate it when Ms. Taylor asks me if there 's something wrong at home . It 's like a question on one of those tests I always do really bad on , no matter what school I 'm going to-if you think about the question long enough , you can make any answer fit . <p> The day before Ms. Taylor asked the first time , it was a normal day . Mom got in bed and I made macaroni and cheese , and Rona and I watched Rugrats and I made Rona take a bath . Mom called us in and asked us to rub her feet for a minute and said that in the morning she would get up and fix our lunches and after work , she would go to the grocery store . If she was in a good mood , we might have chicken or hamburgers for dinner and watch a movie together ; if she felt bad , I 'd make macaroni and cheese again and Rona and I would watch Rugrats . <p> " No , " I told Ms. Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as they usually were . But I knew that 's not what she meant , that if it were a test , she 'd mark my answer wrong . I knew everybody 's mom did n't cry all afternoon just because it was raining out , and go to bed at five o'clock , that everybody did n't eat dinner alone every night in the living room with the T.V. on , like some weird little grown-ups . <p> " Rona , " Mom calls . She 's finished laying everything out on the blanket-all the little jars and packets , the paper plates in little straw baskets , the cloth napkins and real silverware and plastic wine glasses for our water . When Mom was laying out the picnic stuff , her movements were knife-y and distracted . It 's a way she gets , like all her energy is coming out in short little lines like the ones you make in a dot-to-dot picture , only there is no picture , just a jagged design going all over the place but not making anything . I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , she starts talking in a way I hate-just a lot of different sentences that could be about anything : " We have to wash your hair tonight ; why did n't we get that done this morning ? " ; " Maybe we 'll see if Danny wants to go to the movies tomorrow , would you like that ? " ; " Remember how much we liked Arizona-the mountains , the sunshine ; would you and Rona like to move to Arizona ? " and every sentence has a question on the end of it that I do n't want to answer . <p> Rona is coming back , slowly , looking at something she found in the grass . Mom suddenly says , " I guess I like it all right here now . It 'll be nice when it 's spring . What do you think , should we stay ? " <p> " What do you think " she asks again . <p> God has forsaken us but I ca n't say I am surprised . For a long time now , god 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be more dutiful , he said my lack of faith was a sin , but I just do n't believe that 's what got us in all this trouble . How can I put my faith in something that 's disappearing ? I have children to take care of , horses to keep alive , a home to find . <p> Mom is making us plates of food , most of which I do n't want , and I know Rona wo n't eat any of hers . " Gross , " says Rona , picking up a little piece of dark bread , the kind that comes in thin squares and tastes like it 's about a hundred years old . <p> " Thank you , Rona , " says Mom . <p> " This is a stupid picnic , " Rona says . <p> " Thank you again , " says Mom . <p> We sat huddled under a blanket all day today while the snow swirled outside . The children are frightened now , and no longer think of playing . They ask for stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of any-my memories flicker like a dying light . Where did I get this baby ? I thought today , just for a second , when I turned my eyes upon her . Whose children are these and what am I supposed to do with them ? I stared at the gray-blue snow through a crack in the canvas and for a second it looked like the world was closing . Just for a second I imagined I was inside some warm , dark , furry body , and the place I was in was getting smaller and smaller , and when it closed completely , I would be gone . <p> The horses need grass . Today I will have to see if I can dig some out . The children are hungry too . All we have left is feed corn . The children cried when I gave it to them again today . Also the baby is poorly again . There is nothing for her to eat , and the milk is all dried up in my flat , shrivelled breasts . <p> All this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I imagined we would name her after the place we arrived , but if she dies here , I will name her after this place . I will have to name this place , then . I do n't have any idea where we are . <p> Suddenly , with a bad feeling , I figure out why we 're here . Mom is fixing her skirt and pushing her hair back , looking across the triangle of grass at one of the buildings across the street . <p> " Girls , " she says , but she does n't even look at us . " Are you having a good time ? " She 's watching the building . Two people are coming out of the glass door . The two people walk up the walk and separate ; one goes to the parking lot , one comes toward us . It 's a man . Mom is still , her glass of water in her hand and her eyes on the man . " Is this a good picnic ? " she 's saying . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big smile toward the man , one that says , " Everything 's fine here . Everything 's great , " that it suddenly makes me furious to see . <p> God has forsaken us . There is only me . The thought is round like an egg . <p> The man keeps walking toward us but he does n't see us . He looks at his watch , shifts his coat from one arm to the other . <p> " Oh look , " says Mom . " There 's Brian Boyd . Remember , we met him at Marie 's ? " <p> I killed Jake and Zack today . I shot them with Dennis 's gun . They were starving and there is no grass to be found , the snow having reached a depth of five feet or more . All of the feed is gone too , and they were suffering . So we will have food , now , but , if we live till the snow melts , though <p> I do n't see how it 's possible , we 'll have to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we meet a lot of people at Marie 's , mostly men , and most of them seem the same to me . They all have something wrong with them-they smell bad , or they hardly talk at all , or they do n't like kids , or they do n't have a job . <p> " Who 's stupid Brian Boyd ? " says Rona , and Mom gets an upset look on her face . <p> " Shush ! " she says . <p> More snow . am trying to make a pair of snowshoes from bent branches and hair from the horses ' tails . Though I do n't know where I would walk if I could . <p> Since we have no horses , I do n't suppose we 'll need the wagon after the snow melts . I took Dennis 's axe and chopped off a little piece of the back of the wagon box for firewood . <p> The man glances at us but he does n't recognize us . He looks away . <p> " Brian , " says Mom . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day now trying to keep the children from worrying . Today I made up a story-about a boy and a girl , stuck on a desert isle in the middle of the ocean . The hungry waves are eating the island inch by inch . <p> " But they know what to do ! " cried Ezekiel Obadiah , before I could get to the part I had made up , about a ship of good sailors happening upon the isle and rescuing them . <p> " They get buckets and wheelbarrows and they go to the middle of the island , where there 's plenty of sand , and they fill up the buckets and take the sand to the edges of the island and spread it around till the island 's big again . " <p> " But wo n't they run out of sand ? " I asked . " What then ? " <p> " They ca n't ! " said Ezekiel . " The sand goes all the way to the middle of the earth . " Annabelle Amanda nodded . " It goes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it starts to run out , it 'll make itself into more , " said Ezekiel . Children have so much optimism . For a moment , looking at the little pile of firewood I had chopped that day , felt optimistic too , though there was no reason . Firewood is the next thing we 're going to run out of . I ca n't chop down the whole wagon with winter coming on . <p> Brian Boyd comes over to us , a question on his face . <p> " It 's Colleen Hanley , " Mom says . The way she says her own name makes it sound as if there 's someone else in our presence , someone we 've heard of , but never met . " We met at Marie and Bill 's ? " Mom smiles that smile and looks from him to us and back to him . " My girls , Justine and Rona ? " she says , as if she might not be right about that . <p> The baby woke exceedingly poorly today . She refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowshoes today but the braided cords quickly tore away from the wood . <p> The guy Brian smiles and says , " Oh yeah , hi , I remember you . " He 's dressed like the place he just came out of is his work . " What are you doing here ? " <p> " We 're on a picnic ! " Mom says . Her words are like when someone turns on the light in the middle of the night . <p> " What are you doing here ? Do you work over there across the street ? Do you work on Saturdays ? " <p> " Yeah , " Brian nods . " These are your kids ? " he says . As if he has a hard time putting two and two together . <p> " Two and two are four , " I say to Brian . Mom 's smile turns to glass . <p> Maybe we 'll get to know Brian , maybe not . It does n't matter . " Remember Brian , girls ? " Mom will say , eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates on his birthday . We 'll wear the dresses again , next time we go to Marie 's for something fancy . <p> " Your imagination is wonderful , Justine , " Ms. Taylor said to me , the last time she called me to her desk . That 's what I 'm thinking about , looking at Brian Boyd 's stupid face . " But you have to try to think in terms of facts a little more . Try to think in terms of things that could actually happen . It 's history we 're talking about , not invention . " <p> " I know what facts are , " I told Ms. Taylor . " I made macaroni and cheese four times this week . Yesterday my mom cried from three-fifteen p.m. to eight-thirty p.m . On October 6 , Alex Brennan called me a cock-sucking cunt . " <p> I also know the answer to Brian 's question . Looking at Mom , in her twisted position , her face stretched up toward Brian , I suddenly know the answer to the question , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are waiting , in this place-it does n't matter if it 's California or Massachusetts or Timbuktoofor Mom to get better or to get worse . <p> Maybe I 'll grow up first . <p> The thought has no shape , no color ; it 's like a breath of cold air in the middle of nowhere . Gulped in and breathed out as if everything else in the world was gone . Everything except you , taking that icy breath and not being able to tell if it was your first one or your last one , if you were dying or being born . <p> " Well , " says Brian , like he 's got ta go . Mom looks like a week-old balloon somebody 's sticking a pin into . Rona is on the blanket by Mom 's feet , and she looks like a little girl I once saw in a painting , sitting on the floor of a big dark room with a bright light shining on her . The little girl was wearing a fancy dress and there was no one else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting you could see , she was just brush strokes . Just lines and blobs of color not held together by anything , and you felt so bad for her , all alone in that room with no one to take care of her , discombobulating into pieces of color . <p> Today I named the baby . We buried her as best we could , under the snow at the foot of a pine sapling on the west side of the hill . Perhaps someday we can return to this spot and put up a proper marker . <p> We have food for a month . The sun shone for a moment today . If it stops snowing and if it shines tomorrow and the day after that , maybe we can set out again for California . <p>
