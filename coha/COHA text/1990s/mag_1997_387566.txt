WINSTON CUP UPDATE : NASCAR 's tech regulators make the wind tunnel their new court of small claims ; the jury is still out on the Ford Thunderbird 's aerodynamics. // NO RACING SERIES is more carefully orchestrated to keep the contenders nearly equal than NASCAR 's Winston Cup championship . In addition to holding engine technology to mid- ' 60s levels-pushrod valvetrains , castiron blocks , carburetors , distributors , mechanical fuel pumps-the National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing is more than willing to micromanage its rule book to ensure photo finishes . Willingness to make ongoing rules adjustments-and to listen to concerns aired by the various teams-also means that the sanctioning body is regularly subjected to lobbying efforts worthy of the halls of Congress . Through much of the 1996 season , Ford teams complained that the Chevy Monte Carlo bodywork , as approved for NASCAR competition , created an unfair aerodynamic edge over the Thunderbirds . And when the Rick Hendrick Monte Carlos of Jeff Gordon , ' 96 season champ Terry Labonte , and Ricky Craven scored a 1-2-3 sweep at the Daytona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed . Photograph Dale Jarrett 's Thunderbird held the early ' 97 points lead in the Winston Cup . // The net result was a series of tiny tweaks to the aerodynamic profiles of the T-Birds-as well as frequent trips to the Lockheed wind tunnel in Marietta , Georgia-as Winston Cup Series Director Gary Nelson sought to make the playing field as level as a billiard table . After Daytona , NASCAR initially allowed Thunderbird campaigners an additional IA inch of front air dam . That 's an infinitesimal amount in a street car , but at 180 and 190 mph , tiny increments make a difference . Reducing front ground clearance restricts the amount of air forcing its way under the car at racing speeds , redirecting it over the hood and increasing downforce at the front . More front downforce equals more grip , improving turn-in , and less air under the car improves straightaway speed . Predictably , the Chevy camp howled at this dispensation , even though Jeff Gordon followed up his Daytona 500 victory by winning the 400-miler at Rockingham , North Carolina , a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race at Atlanta Motor Speedway the week after that , NASCAR restored the T-Bird front spoiler to its original dimensions . Jarrett and Ted Musgrave responded with a dominating T-Bird performance at Darlington , South Carolina , March 23 , whereupon NASCAR whittled a 1/4 inch off the rear decklid spoiler of the Ford entries prior to the 500-mile inaugural of the brand-new Texas International Raceway near Fort Worth . Less rear spoiler equals less rear downforce , which in turn means less rear-end grip . NASCAR 's aero-tweaking was overshadowed at Texas by complaints about the new $110 million track , a fast 1.5-mile oval with dual banking-8deg low , 24deg high , a design conceived to accommodate both Indy cars and NASCAR stockers . See " Race Paving 101 , " page 90 . When the dust had settled , 25 of the 43 starters had been involved in crashes of varying magnitudes , nine severe enough to take them out of the race . The problem seemed to be the relatively tight doglegs at turns one and four , which made passing difficult and frequently hazardous . Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicar crash , was the most vociferous among the many drivers who criticized the new facility . " I really believe they 're going to have to do a total reconstruction to get this place right , " he said . Meanwhile , Ford chalked up another victory-the first ever in the Winston Cup for Jeff Burton , with Jarett right behind-and NASCAR went back to the wind tunnel . Although Jeff Gordon ended Ford 's win streak on April 13 by bumping Rusty Wallace aside within sight of the finish line at Bristol , Tennessee , NASCAR 's technical crew continued to ponder the possibility of further changes to the Thunderbird 's aerodynamics . Further proof of NASCAR 's determination to impose equality on the Winston Cup series is its new weight rule . The cars still have to weigh in at 3,400 pounds minimum , without the driver . But consistent with NASCAR 's game of inches , there 's also a new minimum-3,600 poundsfor car and driver together . Under the car-only weight system , a driver like 1995 champion Jeff Gordon , who scales in at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale Jarrett , a 200-pounder . On the other hand , adding 50 pounds of ballast to achieve parity is n't quite as egalitarian as it may seem , since the team has some discretion in placing the ballast to improve weight distribution . Still another element in the lobbying-beyond aerodynamic issues-is the question of horsepower . Leading Chevy teams complain that the Ford engines-in particular , the Robert Yates engines of Dale Jarrett and Ernie Irvan-have a distinct edge in output versus even the best of the Chevy motors , as well as the Pontiac engines , which are , of course , identical to Chevy 's . Photograph Aero Adventures // As the teams headed for Martinsville , Virginia , and round eight of the 32-race season , there were rumors of possible weight handicapping for Thunderbirds-all dismissed by NASCAR , but persistent nonetheless . Finally , even as controversy swirled around the Winston Cup Thunderbirds , Ford created another stir by stating that it would discontinue the current production T-Bird at the end of the ' 97 model year , with no immediate replacement in sight , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Thunderbird teams . ( There were 23 T-Birds at Texas , versus a dozen Chevrolets and eight Pontiacs . ) NASCAR would n't have much of a series without Ford , and its rules allow Ford to campaign Thunderbirds through 1999 . Ford has made it clear , however , that it does n't want to race a car that it no longer sells . What it will race instead is a source of ongoing speculation . Ford insiders hint that there may be a NASCAR Taurus next year . But Jack Roush , who fields a T-Bird for perennial front-runner Mark Martin , claims that nothing has been settled and that it 's already almost too late to prepare a competitive Taurus for the 1998 season . So as the ' 97 Winston Cup championship heads into its second half , at least a few things seem clear amid the uncertainties : Dale Jarrett and Jeff Gordon are the likeliest bets to unseat ' 96 champ Terry Labonte for the ' 97 title ; Dale Earnhardt is struggling in his bid for an eighth championship ; and NASCAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the actual racing . Maybe even more . PPG-CART UPDATE : Spectacular debut for new American chassis . WINNING IN A major league racing debut is like stepping up to the plate in your first major league at bat and swatting one over the fence . Impossible ? No . But very unlikely . Photograph Michael Andretti parlayed the power of the redesigned Ford-Cosworth XD V8 and an all-new car to title contention in the early rounds of the PPGCART series . // Yet in the 1997 PPG-CART World Series opener at Homestead , Florida , Swift Engineering , Newman-Haas Racing , Ford-Cosworth , and Michael Andretti combined to hit a resounding home run with an all-new made-inAmerica chassis . The emergence of chassis builder Swift , headquartered in San Clemente , California , makes this something of a. turning point in a series dominated by cars built overseas . The PPG-CART World Series is America 's premier open-wheel racing campaign , as well as this country 's motorsports techno-showcase . For the past 14 years , however , it 's been largely an imported show . Bobby Rahal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American-made chassis , but without success . The dominant chassis of the past few seasons-Lola , Penske , and more recently , Reynard-are all fabricated in England . And with the demise of the old Buick-Menard V6 , last of the so-called CART stock-blocks , engine sourcing is split between the United Kingdom ( Ford-Cosworth and Ilmor-Mercedes ) and Japan ( Honda and Toyota ) . But the arrival of the Swift 007. i injects a welcome element of Yankee ingenuity . A successful producer of small open-wheel racing cars since its establishment in 1983 , Swift elected to make the jump into Indy cars when Newman-Haas co-owner Carl Haas ended his long association with Lola Cars as U.S. distributor . Primary credit for the new chassis goes to Swift cofounder David Bruns , with support from Ford motorsports engineering . And add to the contributors list Newman-Haas aero expert Mark Hanford and engineers Peter Gibbons and Brian Lisle , as well as a state-of-the-art computeraided design system . But the real architect of the 007. i is Swift 's advanced wind tunnel , which has also been used to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving plane beneath the wheels , rather than the more common static approach . It 's a critical distinction in the aerodynamic development of an openwheel race car , since the exposed wheels create additional aero variables when they 're turning . Two visible results of the Swift wind tunnel program are the exhaust system for the Ford-Cosworth engine and the transmission , neatly packaged out of the airstream at the rear of the car . The net result : a competitive car right out of the box , even though track testing did n't begin until a mere six weeks before the first race . Andretti followed up his Florida win with third place in round two , at Surfer 's Paradise , Australia , and was running in fourth place at Long Beach , California , before a series of tire failures . Three of the four engines used in CART cars appear to have achieved something close to power parity . With lower turbo-boost pressure for 1997-a safetyoriented rule change aimed at reducing top speeds-the engine picture has changed a bit . Redesigned for the new season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still seemed to have a small edge in the early racing rounds , even though the updated Ford-Cosworth XD and IlmorMercedes IC1O8D had reduced that edge to a hair 's breadth . Racing engine designers are always reticent about discussing improvements , but extensive remapping of electronic engine-control systems played an important part in broadening the powerbands , particularly for the Ilmor-Mercedes . Meanwhile , Toyota , the ' 96 newcomer , was still playing catch-up with the redesigned RAV8B version of its engine . Although Honda and Mercedes engines dominated qualifying in the first three rounds , Ford-Cosworth propelled Andretti 's Swift and Scott Pruett 's Reynard to victory in Florida and Australia , respectively , before Alex Zanardi 's Reynard scored for Honda at Long Beach . All of which adds up to another memorable season . The PPG-CART campaigners may be locked out of the Indy 500 , but they continue to field the most competitive open-wheel racing show in the world . // Swift Secrets // <p>                    @
