<p> How many folks are fed up with too much growth , construction , development and traffic ? <p> Like much of the metro area , Westminster is about to answer this question in the political arena . A fierce battle is shaping up among Westminster council candidates who disagree on how growth should be handled in this northern suburb . <p> The first fight is between Mayor Nancy Heil and her challenger , Councilman Stu Asay . Heil is pleased with recent retail and housing construction , calling the development " progress . " Asay would rather slow down growth and be " more selective " in building out the undeveloped land in the city . <p> So far , Asay has been in the minority voting bloc on the current , seven-member council . But several council candidates are determined to get into office in hopes of swinging the balance . <p> The heart of Westminster 's business community is the Westminster Mall . In the past two years , new strip malls have sprung up around the shopping center in what used to be vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have popped up . A total of four council seats - the mayor and three council positions - are up for grabs . In addition to the mayor 's race , 11 candidates - including incumbents Fred Allen and Ken Harris - are competing for three at-large council seats . <p> The two council candidates who receive the most votes will serve four-year terms , while the third highest vote-getter will serve two years . <p> " This is a turning point for Westminster , " Harris said . " If the mayor and her supporters are re-elected , Westminster is going to become a high-density city with many traffic problems . <p> " The high density is going to contribute to more crime , more police calls , more fire calls , more gang problems , " he said . <p> A string of council candidates is pushing to stop or slow growth . That list includes Harris , Charles Martin , Glenn E. Scott and Jason Everts . " I 've lived in Westminster for 31 years , and I 've always enjoyed the quality of life that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality is being destroyed . " <p> Harris shoots down further housing construction , but critics have slammed him for backing developers with money . The councilman recently supported a $ 1.8 million incentive package for a builder who plans a shopping complex West 92nd Avenue and Sheridan Boulevard . <p> That does n't jibe for candidates who want nothing to do with growth - residential or business . One office seeker , Martin , described himself as the " anti-growth candidate . " " I 'd be really happy if we did n't grow anymore , " Martin said . " I 'm not convinced that we need new growth , but by gosh , if we are going to get new growth , let 's do it right . <p> Martin , Asay and Scott have formed an informal " control-growth " ticket . The three men do n't have an organized campaign , but they support one another by handing out and mailing each other 's campaign literature . <p> Scott warned that Westminster - a shopping powerhouse - needs continued healthy sales tax revenues , but residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . " We do n't want to get to the point where we have declining residential values and end up looking like Englewood or Northglenn , " said Scott , referring to two cities that have watched their retail base dry up . <p> Allen , Dori Walter and Glenn Axelson said they do n't see growth as a widespread , devastating problem . <p> Allen is pleased with the recent " growth spurt , " but he said it 's over and construction is slowing down . The city , he said , had similar development booms in 1978 and 1984 , and returned to " normal " without any problems . <p> " I think growth is a false problem , " Allen said . " Some people are trying to make a big thing out of growth , but the problem is pretty much solved . " <p> Axelson agreed . " There are some people who say we are going to hell in a hand basket , but I do n't believe that 's the case , " he said . If elected , Axelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track the city 's retail community . The group would study retail issues and make recommendations . Walter would focus on traffic and air quality issues . She wants Westminster to study shuttle bus options and bicycle lanes to reduce congestion . <p> The remaining candidates - Jason Worley , Elmer " Butch " Hicks , Jim Preston and Dennis Stark - have distanced themselves from the growth issue , focusing on individual campaigns and ideas . <p> Hicks supports a growth plan developed by residents . <p> " We have a growth management plan , but the residents want to know what it is , " Hicks said . " Any growth plan is only as good as the input you get for it . " <p> Hicks also advocates strong crime prevention and youth education programs , such as after-school tutoring . <p> Preston wants to set up a strong link between residents and elected officials . " I think the citizens need an advocate on the council that ensures their recommendations are seriously considered , " he said . <p> Preston also wants Westminster hooked up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but his key issue is to get new blood onto the city council . It 's " not appropriate " to have council members serve for several years , he said . <p> Worley 's goal is to " change the focus of the city council , " with more time and money spent revitalizing existing businesses and neighborhoods . <p> WESTMINSTER <p> MAYOR <p> Stuart F.
