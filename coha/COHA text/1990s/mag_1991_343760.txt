Integrating back into the world is a priority issue for the U.S.S.R. Today it is also a necessary issue , due to the economic straits of this country . <P>  --  Soviet economist Grigori Yavlinsky <P> Yavlinsky , who advises both Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin , sounded what is rapidly becoming the predominant theme of Soviet policy . The nation needs enormous sums of Western aid to overhaul its collapsing economy . But it has no chance if it maintains a society largely walled off from the outside world . So Moscow is maneuvering to open the country to foreign influence in ways that might make not only Lenin and Stalin but also some of the czars spin in their graves . <P> For openers , Gorbachev is in effect applying for membership in that exclusive capitalist club , the G-7 ( the Group of Seven major industrial and financial powers  --  the U.S. , Canada , Britain , France , Germany , Italy and Japan ) . After dropping some heavy hints , the Soviet President last week came right out and asked for an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July . There he could make his pitch in person to the leaders of the countries that could supply the grants , loans and credits he seeks and try to reassure them that the money would be put to good use rather than disappearing into the maw of the chaotic Soviet economy . <P> The Soviet President began by indirectly asking the West to help him plan an economic makeover . He gave his blessing to a mission by Yavlinsky to seek the advice of government and private economists from the capitalist world in drafting a coordinated program of foreign aid and internal Soviet reforms . The idea is to use the aid to finance the creation of a true market system in the U.S.S.R. , which would inevitably open the economy to the influence of foreign governments and such aid-granting and - monitoring institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . Yavlinsky spent last week meeting with academics at Harvard . This week he will join Yevgeni Primakov , one of Gorbachev 's top troubleshooters , in Washington for talks with government experts . <P> Most dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament , enacted a law granting all citizens  --  as of Jan. 1 , 1993  --  the right to travel freely overseas and even to leave the country for good and settle abroad . The statute is a major step in converting the U.S.S.R. from a dictatorship governed by its leaders ' whims to what reformers call a law-based society . But at least the timing of passage was undoubtedly affected by the government 's hunger for American dollars . Only a week earlier , the measure seemed to be sidetracked , probably for many months . But it was revived with Gorbachev 's strong support after telephone conversations between the Soviet leader and George Bush . Free emigration is a precondition for a lowering of very high U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods and for the granting of Export-Import Bank credits to finance the purchase of American products .
