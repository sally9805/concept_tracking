EVERYONE IN TOWN RUSHED TO WELCOME JULIE , BUT SHE REBUFFED US ALL . THEN I DISCOVERED HER SAD SECRET I COULD ONLY HOPE IT WAS N'T TOO LATE TO WIN HER TRUST . <p> We did n't mean to shut out Julie . Truly , we did n't think of ourselves as a closed group , or of Julie as an outsider . At least , not at first . I was so pleased that our new neighbors were a young couple with small children . It will be so nice , I thought that first day , having people our age next door : " Her name is Julie , her husband is David , and their children are just a little younger than Megan and Kim , " I told Steve that night . " I took over coffee and cookies , hut I did n't stay-you know what moving day is like . But next week , I 'll ask Julie " round , and she can meet the others . " The others were Ellen , Kathy , and Alice . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's houses-actually , in Camphell 's Cove you can walk to most places . We 'd known one another all our lives , and although Alice and I had gone away to college , we 'd come back here to live . Now our husbands commuted to the city , and we all agreed that there could n't he a better place than this seaside town to bring up our kids . Summer was almost over when Julie and David moved in . The children were relishing their last taste of freedom before school started . Most days , we mothers would meet at the beach to sip coffee and supervise the kids in the rock pools . It was casual , easy , and I thought Julie would enjoy coming with us . A few days after they 'd moved in , I saw her hanging out washing , so I called to her over the fence . " Hi , Julie . How 's it going ? " " We 're getting there , " she said . " There 's a lot to do , though . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggested , and I told her about the group going to the beach . " We could walk , but I usually take the car because I take along coffee and anil drinks for the kids . We 'll go right after lunch and he home by four . " She shook her head , her long fair hair blowing over her face . " Thanks , Beth , but there 's too much to do , " she said . " David has taken the week off , so he 's at home . " " Let me take the children along then , " I said . " Get them out of your way for a bit . " " No , thanks , " she said , " not when David is at home . " She pinned the last sheet to the line , picked up her laundry basket , gave me a quick smile , and went inside . Well , I thought , half-amused , half-annoyed . She certainly knows her own mind . I could understand that there was a lot to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having her husband there , but she could have accepted the offer to take the children . Steve loves our two daughters dearly , but I knew hc would have jumped at such an offer so that we could get more done . " I thought you were going to bring your new neighbor along , " Alice said , pouring coffee for the two of us before the others arrived . I told her what Julie had said , and she agreed that her Ted would have leaped at the chance too . " I caught a glimpse of Julie in Stanton 's Ilardware the other day , " she said . " At least , it must have been her . She was buying paint . She had on a long floaty skirt . I do n't think I 've ever seen anyone in a hardware store wearing anything but jeans before . " We had another week of perfect late-summer weather , and I did ask Julie again if she 'd like to come to the beach , but she was still too busy . Steve and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , and he seemed pleasant . I thought he would have accepted Steve 's offer to come over and have a beer if Julie had n't reminded him that they 'd promised to take Amy to have a look at the school . Amy was 6 , and their little boy , Daniel , was 3 . Our Megan , 9 , and Kim , 7 , thought Daniel was the cutest thing , and they were dying to spend more time with their new neighbors . I told them that once school started and Amy and Daniel 's daddy went back to work , there would surely he plenty of chances . " Steve can drive Amy to school along with Megan and Kim , " I told Julie over the garden gate the day before school started . " I thought we 'd walk to school , " Julie said , and she hesitated . And then , a little awkwardly , she accepted the offer , thanked me , and said she 'd have Amy ready . " I could meet all three girls after school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I thought how pretty she was when she was n't being so serious . " That was one of the things David liked-we both liked-about Campbell 's Cove , " she said . " David grew up in a small town , and he loves the idea of walking to school . " It was the first hint I 'd had that , perhaps , coming here was more David 's wish than Julie 's , and I wondered about that . Anyway , the arrangements worked out all right , and gradually the children hegan playing together . Amy and Daniel were nice kids , and I found little Daniel particularly adorable . " He 's like his daddy , " I said to Julie one day when we were in our gardens . She did n't answer right away . Then she said , very quietly , " Yes , he is . " " Now that you 've got Daniel enrolled at nursery school , come and have coffee some morning . I would like you to meet my friends , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd like to meet you . What about Thursday ? " Julie bent to tie Daniel 's laces , her long hair falling to hide her face . " I appreciate you asking , Beth , but I 'm not really into coffee mornings . I 'm doing computer programming at home , you see , so I 'm pretty tied up . " It was a perfectly reasonable response , but I could n't help feeling put off . " Surely you could spare an hour ? " I said . I laughed , but I know it sounded forced . " In Campbell 's Cove , we like to get to know our neighbors . " Julie straightened . " All right , " she said brusquely . " Thursday morning . " Do n't do the any favors , I thought when she 'd gone , and then I had to smile to myself . It was n't a great success , that coffee morning . We all seemed stiff . One of us would ask a question , and Julie would reply . David worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't where Kathy 's sister worked . Yes , they had lived in the city until now , and no , they had n't known anyone who lived in Campell 's Cove-it just seemed like a good place to move to . The only time things lightened up was when Ellen told us about her son being selected for the Little League football team , and how proud her husband was of him . " Do you remember when we were in high school , and Jim was captain of the team , and we had to go to every game so that you could cheer , Ellen ? " Alice asked . Kathy remembered one game when Jim hurt his knee , and Ellen rushed onto the field . " And Jim was mortified , " Ellen said , laughing . We all laughed , except Julie . " Just wait , Julie , " I said quickly . " When Daniel is old enough , I bet David will be right in there with the other proud fathers . That 's Steve 's only regret about having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice pointed out . " What about we make a deal ? Next year a new baby each . " She lifted her coffee mug and looked at us all . " Babies all around , how about that ? " Julie stood up . " I have to go , " she said abruptly . " Thanks for the coffee , Beth . " She said good-bye to the others . We watched her walk away . And then , for the first time , Kathy said it : " She 's different , " she stated flatly . " I do n't know if she was bored , or she thinks she 's too good for Campbell 's Cove and us . Maybe she should have stayed in the city . " And maybe , I considered much later , we made up our minds then and there that Julie did n't fit in . Maybe we did n't give her much of a chance . To be fair , I did have Julie and David over for dinner , and Alice asked her for coffee . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about the baby-sitter , saying it was late and David had an early start . And Alice 's coffee morning was much like mine had been . " She keeps us at a distance , does n't she ? " Alice said later . " And she does dress ... well , differently . " I think that 's when it really started , first one , then another , criticizing Julie . We agreed that she kept us at arm 's length , and we thought the long skirts and hair seemed overly fussy . " Apparently , David likes her in skirts . And he likes her hair , " I told them , for Julie had said that one day when Megan had complimented her appearance . Ellen said that Jim liked the idea of long hair , too , and probably would like to see her in a skirt , but he 'd have to settle for her with short hair and jeans . We all agreed . Sometimes , I did feel uncomfortable because I was often the one who passed on bits of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean she got those kids out of bed just because the stars were so clear ? " Alice asked incredulously . I nodded . " They all came out into the garden . David was carrying Daniel-and he was rubbing his eyes , barely awake . Amy was fighting to stay alert , too , but Julie was asking David to point out Orion and the Nilky Way . " Ellen shook her head . " They 're too young to take that in , are n't they ? " We all thought so . But ... there had been something about the little family : the father and sleepy boy , so like each other ; Julie 's voice , warmer than I 'd ever heard it ; Amy looking up at her father intently .. . I do n't know why , but I found myself wishing I had n't told the others . It was Kathy who spotted Julie cutting the grass , a chore that is n't women 's work in Campbell 's Cove , no matter how much we looked on ourselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alice said when she heard . She looked at me . " If Steve sees her , he 'll say that if she can do it , so can you . Next thing , we 'll all be cutting the grass . " We laughed at ourselves , but . . well , it was something else that set Julie apart . Then there was the kitten . Megan told me about it when she and Kim came home from school . " Oh , Mommy , " she said , her eyes tearing , " that little ginger kitten of Amy 's has been run over . Amy 's mommy found him this morning . He got out of the garden . We have to hurry " cause we 're going to have a funeral for him now . " " A funeral ? " I said , taken aback , concerned about how this would affect my two softhearted little girls . Why did n't Julie just bury the kitten herself , and tell the children about it ? I thought . " We promised we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear-filled too . " We 're going to put on dresses and sing hymns , and Amy says her daddy will make a stone to put where we bury Orlando . " They were determined , both of them , to go , and they kept saying they 'd promised . So , reluctantly , I let them put on dresses and go next door . I could have gone close to the fence and listened , but I did n't want to do that . Nonetheless , I could hear the children 's voices as they sang a hymn and then , making me smile in spite of myself , a popular song from a Disney movie , " You Never Had a Friend Like Me . " When they returned , Kim told me about the rest of the ceremony . " Amy 's mommy said what a good kitten Orlando had been , and how they would always remember him , " she said . " And then we said , " Amen , " and Amy put some of his favorite toys in the grave with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both girls added a special prayer for Orlando . " They did n't seem as upset as I thought they 'd be , " I said to Steve . " But I still do n't think it was right . " " They 'll have to facc things like that some time , Beth , " he said . " But not yet . They 're all too young , " I said , and I thought : And I mean to tell Julie that . I did , the next day , when she was coming home from taking Daniel to nursery school and I was checking my mailbox . She looked at me , her blue eyes very steady , and I could feel my checks growing warm . " I 'm sorry if Megan and Kim were upset , " she said when I 'd finished . " I did n't mean for that to happen . " My checks grew warmer . " They were n't really , " I had to admit . " Oh , they cried a hit , but ... but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at her bare feet in sandals . " I 'm sorry , Beth , " she said . " It was something I felt strongly about . " She looked up then , her eyes troubled , her voice surprisingly gentle . " Children tl do havc to learn to accept death , you know We were all upset about the kitten , but it seemed like a good opportunity . " She did n't wait for me to reply , just turned and walked down her garden path . I went inside , concerned in a way I could n't define . And I did n't tell the others about the kitten 's funeral . They all knew , though , ahout Amy being kept out of school when the first whales came into the bay . Amy told Megan and Kim and they informed everyone else . " And apparently Amy said her daddy stayed home from work because her mommy wanted them all to see the whales together , " Ellen said to the rest of us when we were sorting out the rummage for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is strange ; on the one hand , she keeps her kids home to see whales , and on the other , she leaves them with a baby-sitter so that she and David call go off for a night . " " Amy 's only six , " I pointed out . " A day off from school wo n't hurt her . " The others all looked at me , defending Julie , bit I had to admit I had been annoyed when I heard about Daniel and Amy being left with a sitter . " We could easily have had them , Julie , " I 'd said at the time . " You did n't need to leave them with someone they did n't know . Megan and Kim would have been thrilled . " Julie 's face had assumed that closed look I was beginning to know . " I do n't like asking favors of people , " she 'd said . " We 're not just people , Julie , we 're neighbors , " I returned . I wanted to say friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it too . SLOWLY AS AUTUMN TURNED TO WINTER , I found myself wishing that we could become friends , that I could break through the barrier that Julie had built to keep out people . Somtimes , when I was being really honest wit hmyself , I had to admit tat I 'd help to build that barrier by participating in crtiicizing her . So I stopped sayinyg anything about her when ? I was with others . If anyone else made a comment , I kept quiet . One November afternoon , after days of rain , a pake wintry sun suddenly appeared through the clouds . It was a perfect dat for a walk along the shore , where the waves would be crashing , the gulls soaring . On impulse , I ran out when Julie and the children returned from school . " You 're probably busy , Julie , " I said breathlessly , " and I should be baking a cake for the church sale , but let 's drop everything and walk along the bay . It 's marvelous on a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , slowly , she smiled . " Give us ten minutes , " she said . " I 'd better find a pair jeans to wear . " The wind buffeted us , the childrens cheeks grow rosy , and we could n't hear ourseleves speaking , but I thiught that maybe that was n't a bad thing . When we had enough , we headed for home , tired , breathless , but swo exhilarated that when we reached our gate , I said , " Come in and have a cup of coffee , Julie . THe kids look like they could use some hot chocolate too . " It was only a moment before she said yes , but it seemed a long moment . I put mugs of hot chocolate on a tray , and I put our coffee on the kitchen counter . Then I went ot the foot of the stairs and called to the children . After a moment , Megan and Amy came running down . " Can we have it in our room , Moomy ? " Megan asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing hospital , " Amy told us . " And I 'm the special nurse , like the one daddy had last time he was in the hospital . " Carefully , Megan carried the tray out of the kitchen . I looked at Julie and knew even before she said anything that this was n't about tonsils or an appendix . Last timem , Amy had said , so there has been other times . " Julie ? " I asked , not quite steadily . She cupped her hands around her warm nug . " DAvid has kidney disease , " she said quietly . " He 's fine now . And maybe he 'll be all right . " And then , her voice low , she said , " And maybe he wo n't . " " I wish I had known , " I said . Because it would have helped me t ounderstand so many things . Julie shook her head . " I suppose there 's a word for it , like being in denial , but I thought if I did n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I talk-we have to-but I did n't want to discuss with anyone else . " She worries if he looks tired , I thought , and that is why she cuts the grass . Now that she was talking , Julie seemed to need t ogo on . Neither of them had any family , she told me , only distant cousins . There were no parents to lean on . She did n't say it as if asking for sympathy , just to tell me . " David wanted us to come and live here , " she said . " He thought it would be better for me and the children to be in a place like this if he was ill agai- " she liofted her chin and added " - if he died . " David had thought it would be better for them to be in Campbell 's Cove . I thought , and felt a deep shame when I remembered how we 'd talked about Julie behind her back . " We did n't make you feel too welcome , " I said slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always felt I did n't fit in . You 've all known one another all your lives . You talk about what happened ten years ago and what will happen ten years from now . Like when you joked about all having babies next year . I do n't know if David will be here then . " I poured more coffee for both of us . I did n't want her to stop talking . " But we have Amy and Daniel , " she said , " and if David dies , I want them to remember their father . I want all of us to store up memories . " She smiled , but it did n't reach her eyes . " I know vou saw us that night , looking at the stars . That is one of the memories we 're storing up . And the whales in the bay , the four of us together , watching them . " I here was so much I wanted to say , and I did n't know how to say it . Perhaps it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to say something . " Will you let me tell Alice and Kathy and Ellen ? " I asked . And seeing her immediate withdrawal , I put my hand over hers for a moment . " Julie , give us another chance , please . " " I do n't want anyone 's pity , " she said fiercely . I shook my head . " I 'm talking about understanding , not pity . And I feel we have a lot to learn , the four of us . " That was true . But I needed to think more about it . Yet already I was realizing that we needed to learn that anything can happen , to anyone . That people are different , and maybe we were too secure , too self-satisfied . " I think I need to learn a few things too , " Julie said unexpectedly . I looked at her and risked a smile . " You could he a little less independent . " She smiled too . " You could be right , " she said . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in half an hour , Beth ? Is it all right if they stay that long ? " I went to the door with her . " It 's fine , " I said . I watched her go up our path and down her own . When she reached her door , she turned and waved to me . " See you , " she said . I nodded and waved back .
