Two weeks ago Dan Jansen beat the clock . Now all he has to do is outrace the past . // On Dec. 4 Jansen became the first speed skater to break the 36-second barrier in the 500 meters when he won a World Cup race at the Viking ship hall in Hamar , Norway  --  the speed skating venue for the upcoming Lillehammer Olympics  --  in the time of 35.92 . " To look up and see 35 was something I 'd dreamed of for a long time , " says Jansen. // Five days later Jansen was back home at the new Olympic speed skating training oval in Milwaukee for the U.S. Speedskating Federation Media Day . Michael Bauman of The Milwaukee Journal began his questioning of Jansen this way : " Dan , you 've won everything in speed skating but one thing .... " // A smiling Jansen interrupted : " And what would that happen to be , Mike ? " // That would happen to be one of those shiny gold things that Olympic winners wear around their necks . Lillehammer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a gold medal . He was only 18 when he finished fourth in the 500 at Sarajevo in ' 84 , a mere .16 off the bronze medal performance . It was on the morning of his first race at the Calgary Olympics in ' 88 that Jansen learned his sister Jane Beres had died of leukemia . That evening America 's heart went out to him when he fell in the 500 . Four days later he skated in the 1,000 meters  --  and fell again . At the ' 92 Games , Jansen finished fourth in the 500 and 26th in the 1,000 , partly because his muscular body was too heavy for the soft ice of Albertville 's outdoor oval and partly because he was weighed down by memories of Calgary . // But with Lillehammer only two months away , Jansen is skating as never before . In Hamar , two days after breaking the world record of 36.02 in the 500 , which he himself had set last March at a meet in Calgary , Jansen established a track record in the 1,000 . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // After breaking the world record in the 500 , Jansen had immediately skated over to his coach , Peter Mueller , and said , " There 's more in there . " Mueller , who won the gold in the 1,000 at the ' 76 Olympics , began working with Jansen in May 1991 and is one reason that Jansen is racing so well . The coach has stoked Jansen 's competitive fire and particularly has changed his approach to the 1,000 . Jansen is no longer trying to skate the 1,000 the same way he does the 500  --  all out from start to finish . Says Jansen , " Peter has taught me how to skate the 1,000 . I 've learned how to skate at not quite top speed and do it under control , which is what you have to do if you want to have anything left for the last lap . I definitely have twice as good a chance for a medal in the 1,000 . The 1,000 has become fun . " // Jansen says he has also been helped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his wife , Robin , named after his sister . The seven-month-old Jane was in attendance at the Media Day press conference as Jansen said , " It changes my outlook on everything , of course . I can leave training , and leave it at the oval , knowing that Jane 's going to be looking up at me when I get home . " // Last , but not least , Jansen has sharpened his focus by limiting his time with the media . Apologizing at the press conference , he said , " Nothing against you guys , I like having you around , but it takes time ... and I just do n't want to hear those questions about the past anymore . " // Come February in Lillehammer , Jansen may silence those questions once and for all .
