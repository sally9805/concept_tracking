In an exclusive interview with TIME , Ellen DeGeneres talks about coming out , staying in and not wanting to be " the lesbian actress " <P> TIME : So , for the record , are you yourself gay ? <P> Ellen DeGeneres : Yes . You 're the first person that I 've  --  I mean I knew that I was going to  --  that was one of the things when I decided to have my character on the show come out , I knew I was going to have to come out too . But I did n't want to talk about it until the show was done . And you know , I watched my friend Melissa Etheridge come out , and she became " the lesbian rock star . " I never wanted to be " the lesbian actress . " I never wanted to be the spokesperson for the gay community . Ever . I did it for my own truth . <P> TIME : Why now ? <P> DeGeneres : I do n't think I could have done this a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted it as readily as they do now . Now I feel comfortable with myself , and I do n't have to be fearful about something damaging my career if it gets out , because now I 'm in control of it  --  sort of . No one can hurt me now . <P> TIME : What was harder , this or coming out to your family ? <P> DeGeneres : This . I mean , I do n't understand a fear of coming out to your friends and family . I 've been really lucky . I have a really great family . I have parents who understand . My mother understands , now even more so . My father is supportive . My dad said the most hilarious thing when I told him what I was going to do on the show . He said , " You 're not going to go all flamboyant , are ya ? " I was like , " Yeah , Dad , I 'm going to completely change . I 'm going to start wearing leather vests . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> TIME : Is being gay something you struggled with ? <P> DeGeneres : No . I ignored it because I did n't really know what it was until I was 18 years old . I dated guys . I liked guys . But I knew that I liked girls too . I just did n't know what to do with that . I thought , " If I were a guy I 'd go out with her . " And then I thought , " Well , I do n't want to be a guy , really . " So I went , " Oh , well , " and just went on with my life . My first gay experience was literally someone else 's idea  --  I was freaked out even by the thought of it . And I thought that was one experience and it was just her , and I started dating guys again , thinking , " Well , I just need to meet the right one . " Never could , really . <P> TIME : So when did you finally give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April what ... ? No , I questioned it up until probably eight years ago or so . But I have n't gone out with a guy since I was 20 . She 's now 39 . <P> TIME : Are you involved with anybody now ? <P> DeGeneres : I just met somebody . This appears to be something I want to last forever , if it can . <P> TIME : Now that you 're out , are you mad that X or Y in the entertainment industry is n't out too ?
