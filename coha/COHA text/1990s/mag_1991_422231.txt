Section : BODY MAKEOVERS She altered her diet and made room for exercise  --  then dropped 75 pounds ! <p> Thirty-one-year-old Kathy Biggerstaff of Evansville , Indiana , had forced herself into lots of strict diets over the years . But the pattern of poor eating habits she fell into after each diet left her gaining , rather than losing . When she reached 200 pounds at 5 ' 5 " tall  --  with her back aching and her cholesterol and blood pressure climbing  --  this clothing-store assistant manager decided it was time to try a healthy lifestyle on for size . By piecing together the best elements of various diets , she designed a custom-made eating-and-exercise plan that helped her drop her high cholesterol and blood pressure  --  and a lot of pounds . <p> " When I was in grade school , I hurt my back doing gymnastics and I was excused from gym class  --  permanently , as it turned out . Looking back , I think that set an early pattern of inactivity for me and formed the foundation of my weight problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining weight  --  a few pounds at first , and then a steady weight gain . From then on , I was always at least 50 to 60 pounds overweight . <p> As I got older , I relied on various diets to take off weight before special occasions like vacations or class reunions . The diets worked temporarily , but I always gained back the weight , and always more than I 'd lost . <p> My health was going downhill , too . My cholesterol was 280 , and my blood pressure was very high at 190/118 . I was on the verge of needing blood-pressure medication , but because I was so young  --  only 22 then  --  my doctor did n't want to start me on medication . Instead , he encouraged me to quit smoking , which I did , and lose weight . But I just kept gaining . <p> The turning point for me came in January 1990 , when I had an illness that left me laid up at home for a month . I was grouchy and irritable , and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; I was depressed . I weighed 200 pounds and I came to the conclusion that I did n't like myself very much . <p> It was then that I made the decision to change my life . And I would do it for me  --  not for an out-of-town visitor or even for my husband . I started by designing my own new eating plan that really suited me . A DESIGNER DIET <p> I was accustomed to eating very fattening foods . I grew up eating dishes like sausage in a biscuit , or ground beef mixed with cream of mushroom soup , served with mashed potatoes and bread . They were all fattening recipes . <p> But I knew from recent reading about nutrition and weight loss that a low-fat diet was the way to go . So I designed a balanced , low-fat diet by combining elements of two other diets  --  Weight Watchers and an exchange diet my doctor had given me . <p> Each day , I ate two to three servings of bread , three low-fat dairy products and six ounces of protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also had two or three vegetables , three fruits and a maximum of three fats , such as mayonnaise ( always a reduced-fat version ) . <p> At first , I stuck firmly to my new eating plan . I even kept a food diary of everything I ate . But I knew if I deprived myself of all the foods I liked , I 'd never stay on a good eating program . So , still using the exchange ideas , I began to make low-fat , low-calorie versions of my regular recipes . <p> One of my favorite dinners is turkey enchiladas , which I used to make with lots of sour cream , cheese and black olives . To trim down the meal , I left off the high-fat olives , added just a tiny bit of reduced-fat shredded cheese and a dash of extra-light sour cream . <p> At first , I made two different versions of the meals I cooked  --  the regular recipe for my family and a low-fat recipe for me . But soon my husband and my 14-year-old daughter switched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just by changing my eating habits , I lost a total of 50 pounds in six months ! And at this point I was ready to start exercising . <p> I knew from reading about dieting that my weight loss would hit a plateau . But I also knew that weight lost by dieting alone almost never stays off . So in June , I joined a " trimnastics " class that combined about 15 minutes of brisk walking with 40 minutes of floor exercises ( like leg circles , stomach crunches and modified sit-ups ) and stretches . We started out doing only a few repetitions of each exercise , and then increased the number of repetitions over the course of six weeks . I wanted some extra aerobic activity , so I often went early and walked briskly for a half-hour before class . I started to feel so much better ! Soon I started walking on weekends , too . And I continued to lose more weight . <p> I kept myself on track by weighing the pros and cons of cheating . Every time I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see numbers like 8 grams of fat and 120 calories in an ounce  --  60 percent fat ! I 'd look at those figures and relate it to my own . ' You 're slender now , ' I 'd tell myself . ' Is that bag of corn chips worth being fat again ? ' I realized it 's not worth it . <p> By Christmas of 1990 , less than a year after I changed my eating habits , I had reached my initial goal  --  135 pounds . But then I realized I could stand to lose a little more . So I kept going . By April 1991 , I had reached my record low  --  125 pounds ! WEIGHTS AND MEASURES <p> Also in April , I struck a deal with a nearby company that has a workout and weight room . I offered to teach an exercise class two nights a week . In return , they let me use the gym weight room . I began teaching the same basic class that I had been taught  --  brisk walking followed by floor exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . I continued losing pounds and inches  --  and I bought my first bikini . <p> I feel so much healthier now . Since I 've built up my lower back and stomach muscles , I no longer experience any pain in my back . My cholesterol has dropped to 110 . And the best news is that my blood pressure is way down  --  120/82 ! <p> I do n't know if I 'll ever get used to being slender . When I 'm shopping , I still walk up to the big sizes first . <p> But my self-esteem has improved greatly . I used to be very upset by people I thought did n't like me . Now I do n't worry about it . They do n't have to like me , because I like me . <p> I still adhere to my eating plan , though I allow myself more healthy snacks now . I 'm not going to quit , because I 'm not on a diet . I 've fit into a new pattern of eating and changed the way I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shape-up success stories of Prevention readers .
