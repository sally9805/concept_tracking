Section : SPEAKING OUT Screening with the prostate specific antigen blood yet some still question its use . <p> This past December , my 56-year-old cousin , David , died of prostate cancer . Just two years before , I had written an article in the SatEvePost entitled , " ' David , Why Did You Wait ? ' : A Profile of Prostate Cancer . " My cousin would be alive today had he been screened earlier with the simple blood test called PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) . Although researchers have known about PSA for more than two decades , it has only been in the last five years that they have used this substance to assess a man 's risk for prostatic cancer . <p> Indeed , the PSA test has profoundly affected the detection and treatment of prostate cancer . The discovery of PSA represents one of the most recent significant advances in the field of prostate cancer . A PSA blood test should be a male Pap smear or mammogram , if you please . At least , that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when the American Cancer Society first endorsed the Pap smear nearly 50 years ago , there seems to be a major debate today about using PSA as a screening test . Critics argue that prostatic cancer is a slow-growing tumor , that 80 percent of all men who are 80 years old have prostate cancer , anyway , and that it is not their cause of death . The critics argue that if so many men have this slow-growing , clinically unimportant kind of cancer , then screening would cause thousands of men to undergo unnecessary procedures and treatments for a disease that probably will not kill them . Cost estimates for screening and related follow-up have been as high as $28 billion ! Obviously , these studies question the cost-effectiveness of prostate screening programs . <p> The use of the recently published Johansson Study by the PSA critics is a perfect example of how anyone can use complex studies to allege anything . The PSA critics point out that in the Swedish researcher 's study , the ten-year survival rate of prostate cancer patients was the same as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular press accounts failed to mention that the mean age at diagnosis was 72 years , that the study excluded younger patients for treatment purposes , and that of the group that showed no greater mortality rates than their noncancerous companions , one out of three had major problems related to local extension of the tumor , including infection , obstruction , and bleeding . <p> How 's that for a nice way to spend your last ten years ? Oh , and by the way , Sweden has the highest mortality rate from prostate cancer in the world . <p> Even here at home , we have a group of researchers headed by such people as Dr. John Wasson of the Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover , New Hampshire , who , with their theoretically assigned probability figures and their decision analysis models , believe that the costs involved in PSA screening may outweigh the benefits . These forces seemed predominant last summer at a highly publicized conference sponsored by the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , which lent even more weight to the anti-PSA coverage . <p> Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either prostate cancer is not an important disease , or at the other extreme , the disease is inevitable  --  so why worry about it , since it will not be the cause of death , anyway ? The problem with the latter bit of illogic is that it refers to latent or microscopic , rather than clinical , cancer . Prostate Cancer Update <p> Cancer of the prostate is now the most common cancer among men in our country . This past year alone , doctors diagnosed nearly 165,000 cases  --  nearly one case every 15 minutes . About 35,000 men died a very agonizing , painful death from metastatic prostate cancer this past year . One in ten men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime ; this is roughly the same percentage as women who will be diagnosed with breast cancer . By the year 2000 , experts estimate that prostate cancer cases will increase by 90 percent , and deaths from the disease will increase by 37 percent . <p> Although the exact cause of prostate cancer is still a mystery , researchers have identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family history . Also , African-American men face a higher risk than Caucasians or Asians . Dr. Peter Scardino , chairman of the urology department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , recently pointed out , " We now know that there are basically two distinct kinds of pro-static cancer . There are those that are clinically unimportant , or latent , and those that are more aggressive , becoming killer cancers quickly . " He added that prostate cancer is absolutely unique in this regard . " You do n't find breast cancer , for example , in women who die of other causes . " PSA Is a Must <p> Dr. Scardino continued : " Recent statistics tell us that about 30 percent of American men over 50 years old are walking around with a microscopic cancer in their prostate , maybe up to the size of a BB . " He also explained the importance of size in detecting a lethal cancer : " The average size of a very early , treatable prostate cancer we find through our tests is usually extremely small , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so-called latent or clinically unimportant . " <p> Dr. William J. Catalona , chairman of the urology department at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , was one of PSA screening 's earliest proponents . In a recent scientific report , he wrote , " An elevated ( above 4 ng/ml ) PSA does not mean the presence of cancer , but rather indicates the presence of prostatic disease and the need for further evaluation . " His article pointed out that cancers smaller than one centimeter usually do not elevate PSA levels . He emphasized that more than 90 percent of cancers detected through PSA-based screening have the potential to become clinically important , judging by their size and grade . Although only 30 percent of the prostate cancers detected by the ' traditional digital rectal exam ( DRE ) were curable , he concludes that some 70 percent now being detected by the concurrent use of PSA and DRE are curable . <p> No one is advocating PSA screening alone . The appropriate goal of an early detection program is to detect only clinically important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valuable tool along with the DRE or prostate ultrasonography . <p> The American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association now recommend PSA testing with a DRE beginning at age 50  --  and at age 40 for men at high risk . Without question , prostate cancer should be detected early . Also without question , PSA should be used as an adjuvant screening test . A Call to Arms <p> Prostate cancer awareness has increased greatly during the past five years , thanks in part to the PSA debate . Major publications have been instrumental in , and are to be praised for , creating and promoting such events as Prostate Cancer Awareness Week ( usually held toward the end of September ) . Support groups for men with prostate cancer have begun to spring up across the nation , as did support groups for breast cancer decades ago . US TOO , formed in Chicago almost four years ago , now has 225 chapters in 45 states and five Canadian provinces . MAN-TO-MAN , formed about the same time , now has 75 chapters . Other groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) have been disseminating more technical information to prostate cancer victims . <p> Now , however , more is needed . Dr. Richard Howe of Houston , a recognized advocate for prostate cancer patients , believes that now is the time to form a National Prostate Cancer Coalition . I enthusiastically second his motion . The purpose of this organization would be similar to that of the successful National Breast Cancer Coalition  --  to raise national awareness while campaigning for research money . Fiscal year 1993 saw $410 million spent on breast cancer research and only $39 million on prostate cancer research . That comes out to $9,000 per breast cancer death per year , versus $1,100 per prostate cancer death per year . These figures do not include such monetary figures as the two-cent-per-pack tax placed on cigarettes last year in California earmarked for breast cancer research . That 's about $38 million per year . <p> There are many men out there whose cousins , hopefully , never have to die the way mine did . Of course , with my family history , I am one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PSA checked every year . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A strong advocate of PSA testing , Dr. Peter Scardino reports , " There are two distinct kinds of prostatic cancer . . . those that are clinically unimportant , or latent , and those that are more aggressive , becoming killer cancers quickly .
