 | The Trivandrum Mail was on time . It came out of the jungle and pounded into Villupuram Junction at 3:18 on a sweltry afternoon in south India . When the whistle first sounded far and deep in the countryside , people began pressing toward the edge of the station platform . What could not walk was carried or helped along  --  bedrolls and market baskets , babies and old people . Michael Tillman got to his feet from where he 'd been leaning against a sooty brick wall and slung a tan knapsack over his left shoulder . A hundred people were trying to get off the train . Twice that many were simultaneously trying to get on , like two rivers flowing in opposite directions . You pushed or were left behind . A pregnant woman staggered in the crush , and Michael took her arm , got her up the steps ,  | and swung himself into the second-class car as the train moved out . Wheels turning , engine pulling hard , running at forty miles an hour through the edge of Villupuram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hanging on to the overhead luggage rack with one hand as the train curved out of brown hills and into green rice country , Michael slid the picture ofJellie Braden from his breast pocket , looked at it , reminding himself again of why he was doing this . Bizarre . Strange . All of that . This curious rainbow of man and knapsack out of Iowa and into the belly of India in search of a woman . Jellie Braden .. . Jellie . . . belonging to another . But Michael Tillman wanted her . Wanted her more than his next breath , wanted her enough to travel the world looking for her . He kept thinking this whole affair was like songs you used to hear on late night radio . How does it all begin ? Who knows . And why ? Same answer . The old Darwinian shuffle . Something primal , something way back and far down . Something whispering deep in the bones or genes , " That one . " So it happened : a kitchen door in Iowa opened and likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortieth year . The dean 's autumn reception for new faculty in 1980 , that 's when it was . Just back from India after his second Fulbright there and still jet-lagged , Michael slouched against the dean 's refrigerator , tugging on his second beer of the afternoon . He looked past faces looking at him or what they took to be him and answered tedious questions about India , suffering the  | white noise of academic chatter in the spaces around him . An accountant 's wife had taken over the India interrogation . Michael gave her 38.7 percent of his attention , planning escape routes and taking a longslow swallow of beer while she spoke . " Did n't the poverty just bother you horribly ? " " What poverty ? " He was thinking about Joseph Conrad now , being halfway through Heart of Darkness on his third reading of it . " In India . It must be awful . " " No . I was in the south , and the people looked pretty well fed to me . You 've been watching those television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guts of Calcutta . " She jumped a little when he said " guts , " as if it were a word she had n't heard before or maybe did n't like to think about . " Did you see any cobras ? " " Yes , the snake charmer in the marketplace had one in a basket . The snake 's mouth was sewn shut to keep it from doing any damage . " " How did it eat ? " " It did n't . It eventually dies . Then the snake man goes out and finds another one and sews its mouth shut , too . That 's the way it works . " " My God , that 's cruel , even though I abhor snakes . " " Yeah , working conditions have gone downhill all over . On the other hand , it 's pretty much like the university . We just use heavier thread , that 's all . " The accountant 's wife blinked at him in the way  | some people do when they encounter lunacy and went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint or whatever on their bodies ? Is n't that strange ? " " No , I did n't see any . They 're mostly up north , I guess . Benares , or Varanasi as they call it now , places like that . Whether it 's strange or not , I ca n't say , depends on your worldview and career plans , I sup-pose . " " Jellie Braden 's been to India , you know . " The senior man in comparative economics leapfrogged the accountant 's wife and had Michael 's attention . " Who ? " " Jim Braden 's wife . He 's the new guy in econometrics we hired away from Indiana . " Michael heard a car door shutting in the driveway . The senior man turned and looked out the window . " Oh , here they come now . They 're a delightful couple . " Braden ? Braden . . . Braden . . . Braden ? Ah , yes , Jim Braden . He 'd interviewed him six months ago before going to India . Never met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at housing during their recruiting visit . Michael felt like writing " Standard issue , greater than or equal to earnest and boring " on the evaluation form . But he did n't and wrote instead , " Jim Braden is a perfect fit , " which amounted to the same thing . James Lee Braden III came into the dean 's kitchen , smiling , shaking hands , being introduced . Jellie Braden smiled , too , in her pale blue suit with a fitted jacket that came to just over her hips and a skirt reaching to midcalf , medium-heeled black boots below the hem . Subtle Jellie Braden . But not subtle enough . It was all there . The cool Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 5  | patrician face coming only from an upper-shelf gene pool , the night-black hair and good skin . A body the old French called rondeur , polite writers would call superb , and flesh magazines would lose control over . Gray eyes coming at you like an arrow in flight and a confidence with men indicating she knew what they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy truths was n't clear at first , but you did n't have to be around Jimmy Braden very long to know it was n't from him . The faculty and assorted others with short attention spans laid down India and took up repertoire number two , another set of standard questions . This time with the Bradens , leaving Michael slouched there against the fridge by himself , watching Jellie . " How do you like Cedar Bend ? " " Are you all moved in now ? " " What courses are you teaching , Jim ? " " Jellie  --  what an interesting name . " The dean 's wife came over . " Hello , Michael . " " Hi , Carolyn , what 's up ? " He and Carolyn had always got along well even though the of deanaroo secretly wished Michael would pack it up and go somewhere else , anywhere . He occupied a high salary line , mainly because he 'd been at the university fifteen years , and Arthur Wilcox would have preferred something a little less expensive and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally looked him up at these affairs , and they 'd talk a bit . The decline of romance was one of their favorite subjects . A few years earlier she 'd gotten acceptably drunk at the Christmas bash and said , " Michael , you 've got balls . The rest of ' em 6 Robert James Waller  | are eunuchs . " He 'd put his arms around her and whispered in her ear , " Merry Christmas , Carolyn . " Over her shoulder Michael had seen the chairperson of accounting watching them . The Chair was holding a glass of nonalcoholic punch and had a green star pinned to his lapel with " Hi ! I 'm Larry  --  Happy Holidays " printed on it in red felt-tip . Michael had grinned at him . For a while he 'd called Carolyn " Deanette . " She 'd liked it well enough to have a T-shirt made up with that handle printed on the front and had worn it to the fall picnic where the faculty was supposed to play volleyball and get to know one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wear the shirt after that . When she 'd told Michael about the T-shirt ban , he 'd said " Screw ' im . " Carolyn had laughed . " Fat chance . Arthur 's Victorian to the core , all bundled up . " When he 'd heard that , Michael 's faith in things working out all right had died another small death . Carolyn was fifty-three but still had fire in her belly , quite a lot of it , he suspected . And he thought it was a damn shame , not to mention the waste of a good woman . How the hell does it happen , he wondered , these mistakes in the matching ? He and Carolyn talked a few minutes . Michael was looking past her , looking at the back of Jellie Braden 's head and wondering if her hair was as thick as it seemed to be , wondering how it would feel to grab a big handful of it and bend her over the dean 's kitchen table right then and there . He somehow had Slow Waltz in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend willingly if he tried it . Carolyn Wilcox followed the point of Michael 's eyes and said , " Have you met Jellie Braden yet ? " " No , I have n't . " The deanette reached over and tugged on Jellie 's sleeve , rescuing her from the fumes of vapidity in which she was swirling . Deans ' wives are allowed to do that when they feel like it , and they do it regularly , leaving a small semicircle of people holding glasses in their hands and looking stupid as the object of their focus is torn away . It 's a shot they ought to put in the yearbook . Jellie Braden turned around . " Jellie , I 'd like you to meet Michael Tillman . If there 's anything incorrigible about this faculty , it 's Michael . In fact , he 's probably sole owner of that property . " Jellie held out her hand , and he took it . " What makes you incorrigible , Dr. Tillman ? " " Just Michael , if it 's okay with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little when he said it . She smiled at the casual way he discarded something it took him nine years in various medieval institutions to acquire . " Aside from that , I happen to believe I 'm highly corrigible , it 's only Carolyn and the rest who think otherwise . " Carolyn patted his arm and drifted away . Jellie Braden looked at him . " I recall Jimmy mentioning you when we were here for his interviews . Somebody on the faculty told him you were eccentric or something like that . " " Jaded , maybe . A lot of people mistake that for eccentricity . " 10 Robert James Waller  | They were sitting only about a foot apart , and she looked over at him . " So am I. " " How 'd you meet , you and Jim ? " " After I came back from India I wanted to hang around Bloomington even though I was n't in school . I wangled a job as secretary in the economics department . Jimmy was a junior professor , just out of graduate school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite to me and wore expensive suits , wrote articles on esoteric topics I did n't understand but which I dutifully typed . I was pretty much lost and wandering back then . When he asked me to marry him , I could n't think of any good reason not to , so I said yes . " Michael listened to what she said and how she said it . She married Jim Braden because she could n't think of reasons not to . That was a strange way of putting it . Close to her like this , gray eyes steady on his , he upgraded his earlier idea about putting her on the dean 's kitchen table . The new plan involved stripping her naked , taking off his own clothes , and flying in that shimmering state of affairs all the way to the Seychelles , first class . Upon arrival it would be a headlong and forever plunge into lubricious nirvana . He was quite certain Jellie Braden would look better than wonderful under a jungle waterfall with a red hibiscus in her hair . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As soon as he asked , a voice in his head groaned , " You dumb ass , Tillman , why 'd you say that ? It 's more than you need to know and too damned forward  --  you just met the woman . " He stood up and stomped out his cigarette on the dean 's Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 11  | driveway . Anyplace else he field-stripped them and stuck the butts in his pocket , but not in the dean 's driveway . Michael was like an old dog there , staking out his territory , making sure he left a little something behind for Arthur to sniff . She walked over to her car and put hers out in the ashtray . " Jimmy 'll complain like crazy when he sees that . He wo n't let me smoke at home when he 's there . I 'll get a lecture on our way out of here , and he 'll spray the car with air freshener two minutes after we hit the driveway . " She looked at him and chewed lightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ten years . I suppose we better go inside . " He started pulling off his tie . " You go ahead . I 'm going back to my apartment and snuggle down with Joseph Conrad . " " Nice meeting you , " Jellie Braden said . " Same here . See you around . " She smiled . " Sure . " And Michael thought of a waterfall in the Seychelles that would be just perfect . Fifteen months later he rode the Trivandrum Mail into south India , toward places he 'd never been , looking for her .  | High summer 1953 , a far place called Dakota and the wind hot and making your greasy clothes stick to your body . Michael Tillman was fifteen then , leaning under the hood of Elmore Nixon 's car , banker Nixon of First National in Custer . T-shirt riding up his back and toes barely touching the cement , he listened to the big V-8 's erratic turn , adjusted the carburetor , listened again as the engine smoothed out and settled down . " Mikey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three more to go yet . " His father was staggering around , whiskey flask buried deep in the back pocket of gray-striped coveralls . Outside at the pumps his mother was filling the tank of a grain truck and wiping her forehead with the back of her arm . July 27 , 4 p.m. at Tillman 's Texaco , a world of heavy smells and flaking paint in Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 13  | fading greens and peeling whites . Roar of traffic on Route 16 out in front ; tourists with suitcases lashed to car tops , on their way to see the faces of Rushmore . Straightening up , Michael removed the protective cloth from the Olds ' fender and slammed the hood . He backed the car out of the service bay and parked it off to one side , stood there for a moment , wiping his hands on a cloth . A Lakota Sioux in rundown cowboy boots , short and sweating into his pockmarks , waited by the roadside for someone or something or some other time better than the one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a Coke from where it lay buried in ice and water . He held the bottle against one cheek , then the other . Stuck it up inside his shirt and laid it against his chest , shuddered once as cold met hot . No rain for weeks , dust devils moving down the roadsides . " Damnit , Mikey ... " His father 's voice slurred and reverberated from inside the station . He put the unopened Coke back in the cooler . Michael slid into another car and pulled it into the service bay . His mother 's handwriting was on the work order , " lube &; oil . " The Chevy lifted on the rack with a whirring sigh , and he unscrewed the oil plug on lawyer Dengen 's Bel-Air . While the used oil drained into a bucket he looked out at Route 16 . One good road is enough , that 's what he was thinking . He walked over to the Vincent Black Shadow parked in the rear of the station , touched the handlebars . His father had taken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was  | Michael 's to keep if he 'd fix it up and learn how to maintain it . He did and owned it , spiritually and physically , from that moment on . One good road ? the Shadow could take him down that road if he learned all there was to know about valves and turning wheels and routes out of here . Michael was already practicing at night , running the Shadow at high speeds through the Black Hills even though he was n't legally old enough to drive . On winter nights when the Shadow waited for spring to come again , there was the jumpshot arching through the lights of small-town gymnasiums . People took notice of Ellis Tillman 's boy , said he might be good enough to play college ball . When he scored fifty-three points against Deadwood his senior year , they were sure of it . At pajama parties the high school girls giggled and talked about boys . They said Michael Tillman had sad brown eyes , lonely eyes , and grease on his hands that would n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles and looked good in his basketball uniform . They said he had a nice smile when he showed it , but he 'd probably end up running his fa-ther 's gas station and never would get the grease off his hands . Sometimes he 'd take one of them to a movie in Rapid City , but mostly he kept to himself . He worked at the station and fished the trout in summer , practiced his jumpshot in the city park until it became a thing of magic . The Shadow , the jumpshot , algebra and Euclid 's geometry  --  they were all of the same elegant cloth , universes contained within themselves , and he was good at them . He was n't quite so Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 15  | good with girls or rooms full of people or English classes where poetry was discussed until it did n't ex-ist . Rooms full of people he did n't care about . Poetry could be dealt with sometime . But he wondered about girls who would become women . Somewhere out in these places of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in his life . And what would that be like ? To be with a woman ? Not sure . Not sure , but wondering . Would she be pleased with him , and how would a boy-man know what to do ? Not sure yet . A little shaky thinking of it and reading the copy of What Boys and Girls Should Know About Each Other his mother had discreetly placed on his bookshelf . Neither she nor his father ever mentioned the book . As with everything else , he figured he was on his own . Nobody was handing out anything to anyone as far as he could tell , except small paperback books that were never mentioned and seemed pretty unromantic in any case . The jumpshot took Michael down roads where the Shadow could n't go . On a December night in 1960 , Ellis Tillman leaned close to his Zenith portable and adjusted the tuning , trying to pull in KFAB in Omaha , Nebraska . The announcer 's voice came and went : " For . . . information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weak signal . Twenty below zero in Custer at 9:14 , wind chill minus forty-eight . More static . He swore at the radio , and Ruth Tillman looked up from across the kitchen table . " Ellis , it 's only a basketball game , not the end of the world . Have they said anything more about Michael 's knee ? " 4  | " No . He 'll be okay . He 's a tough kid . " Ellis Tillman took a sip of Old Grand-Dad and bent close to the radio . He was proud of his boy . The stars shifted or sunspots went away , and the announcer 's voice came back in double time : The Big Red machine 's rollin ' now , on top of the Wichita State Shockers , eighty-three  --  seventy-eight , with just under four minutes to go . Tillman brings the ball upcourt for the Shockers , still limping on the bad knee that took him out of action in the first half . Over to LaRoux , back to Tillman , half-court press by the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen for him by LaRoux and Kentucky Williams . . . . " Go get ' em , Mikey ! " Ellis Tillman stamped his feet on yellow linoleum and pounded the chromelegged table so hard the radio bounced . Ruth Tillman onward to such insanity . Four hundred miles away in Lincoln , smell of sweat and popcorn and the crowd screaming and the coach signaling for what he called the Tillman Special and you 're moving right and slamming your left elbow into the face of the bastard who 's grabbing for your jersey and you 're cutting hard for the double screen LaRoux and Kentucky are setting up and a camera flash bursts from the sideline and your right knee is swollen to half-again its normal size from blood in the tissues . . . and you 've done this a million Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 17  | times before . . . more than that . . . and the power in your legs and shoulders and the grace and balletlike movement and you 're high into the air , left hand cradling the ball over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentle arc toward an orange rim with silver metal showing where the orange paint has rubbed off from the friction of a zillion basketballs .. . and the ball clears the rim and slices the net just the way it used to in the backyard of your South Dakota home and the crowd screams louder and you land on a knee that crumples into nothing and you go to the floor with Kentucky Williams stumbling over you on his way back down the court .. . and you lie there and you know it 's over and you 're relieved it is . And four hundred miles northwest your mother bows her head . Two days later Ellis Tillman got his copy of the Wichita Eagle in the mail . He 'd subscribed to it while Michael was playing ball and would drop the subscription now . On the sports page was the headline SHOCKERS FALL TO NEBRASKA , 91 ? 89 Tillman Hits 24 , Suffers Career-Ending Injury He thought about cutting out the article and posting it in the gas station with the other clippings about 18 Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of any such thing . Michael 's grades barely slipped him into graduate school , but once he was accepted , it was straight , hard work . Brutal work  --  six years of it , including his dissertation . In Berkeley he grew a beard and fell in love for the first time . Her name was Nadia , she wore black stockings and long skirts and came from Philadelphia where her father was a union organizer . They lived together for two years in the sixties when Berkeley was becoming the center of all that counted , so they believed . Nadia joined the Peace Corps and thought Michael should do the same . " Give something back , Michael , " she said . He 'd been offered a fellowship for doctoral study and wanted to take it . " I 'll give something back another way , " he told her . Michael shaved off his beard . Nadia packed and left . Disappointed , but not angry , and on to other things . " It 's probably better this way , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what you 've said about your life , and from what it 's like living with you , I 'm beginning to think only children are raised to be alone . At least you were . " She softened , looked at him . " It 's been good , Michael . " He smiled . " It has been good . I mean that , Nadia . You 've taught me a lot about a lot of things . Stay in touch . " He kissed her good-bye , watched two years of his life roll away on a Greyhound , and walked to the Department of Economics , where he handed in his letter accepting the fellowship . He went back to  | his apartment and could still smell the scent of Nadia , looked at her posters of Lenin and Einstein and Twain on the wall . He missed her already , but she was right : he liked being alone and had been trained for it . Only children understand it ultimately will come to that , and they live a life practicing for the moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , halted , arms passing fruit and tea through the windows in exchange for rupees . Mosquitoes passing through the windows in exchange for blood . Sweat running down the curl of his spine , down his chest and face , Michael Tillman stared again at the picture of Jellie Braden . People in the fields working rice , bullocks hauling loads of wood down country roads , birds flying alongside the train for a short distance and then veering off Whistle far up ahead as the engine plowed past another village . A face looked over his shoulder . The man smiled and pointed at the photo of Jellie . " Very pretty . Nice lady ? " Michael said she was very nice . The dam crumbled , everyone within a radius of ten feet immediately wanted to see the photo . They handled it carefully ,  | passing it from one to the other and nodding , looking up at Michael and smiling . " Your lady ? " one of them asked . He 'd never thought of her that way and paused before answering . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? while the train rolled on through the late afternoon and into a purple evening . Two hours into the ride a seat opened up . He started for it , then noticed the pregnant woman off to one side , the one he 'd helped onto the train . He pointed to the seat . She nodded in thanks and sat down . Soon after he felt a tug on his sleeve . Two Indian men had jammed against each other , leaving a corner of their seat for Michael . He tossed his knapsack in the overhead rack and crouched on the space they 'd created . Talk began , mostly sign language , but progress was made . The men were farmers going home from market . They asked simple questions and discovered Michael 's profession . Immediately he was honored in the way Indians honor teachers  --  respect , awe , gratitude . " The highest calling , " one man said in heavily accented English , and the others agreed , smiling and nodding . Maybe he 's right , Michael thought . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to a profession or a person for decades . You start focusing on the ugly parts , forgetting the overall beauty of what 's up close to you . He 'd begun graduate study with soaring thoughts of becoming a scholar and a teacher , indeed the highest calling as far as he could tell . In his early twenties he 'd imagined bright students he would lead through the intricacies of advanced economic theory , 22 Robert James Waller  | maybe a Nobel Prize out there if the scholarship was diligent . But in some way he 'd never been able to define , graduate school and his early years as a professor had taken the dreams away from him . Something to do with the emphasis on method , with plodding data collection and analysis . Something to do with social scientists trying to operate like physicists , as if the roiling complexities of social reality could be handled in the same way as the study of nature . And something to do with students who cared only for job preparation , who demanded what they called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found so lovely , so much like a clear , cold mountain stream running through his brain . " Good theory is the most practical thing you can study , " he told them . They did n't believe him . He gave a little speech at a College of Business and Economics faculty meeting . " We are interested , it seems , not in creating , but only in maintaining ? maintaining our comfortable , enviable life-style . If the taxpayers ever discover what 's really going on around here , they 'll march on us . We 're like the goddamned students and the students are like us dumb bastards : it 's come down to cooperate and graduate . " Two heads out of 137 nodded in agreement , 135 wished the dean would get on with the meeting and talk about next year 's salary prospects . Michael did n't make any more speeches after that . So the dreams eroded . And Michael Tillman began to turn inward , to follow only what made sense to him . He was trying to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contemplating the  | great sweep of time and space , wondering about the peculiar evolutionary magic that had put him and not someone else here at this particular time in a universe still expanding . People saw him as distant , and he was . People saw him as arrogant , but he was n't , quite the opposite . He simply decided to go off by himself , go his own way . People mistake shyness and reclusive-ness  --  both of those  --  for arrogance . It 's a convenient label slapped on by those who see only the surface of things and nothing more . He understood as much and let them believe what they chose to believe . As a teacher he was different , but effective . Good students liked him , the middling ones were afraid of him . The poorer students avoided his classes . He was n't a kindly Mr. Chips , and never would be , yet he respected grit and determination , spending long hours with those who had trouble in his classes . And he reserved a special disdain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do what he asks and you 're okay , dead meat otherwise , " the graduate students said . " He walks around barefoot in the classroom sometimes , but he knows what he 's talking about . " The undergraduates wrote good things and bad things on his evaluations : " Tests are too hard . Needs to understand young kids and parental pressure better . " " He 's a little scary but gives me a lot of help outside the classroom . This is a hard course . " " His ideas have caused me to reevaluate my life . " 24 Robert James Waller  | " Seems arrogant at times , self-centered . Nobody can be as smart as he seems . " " I liked his aproach sic . " " Needs a haircut and sometimes takes the Lord 's name in vain . " " Good in class but never seems to be around except for his office hours . I 'm working at Kmart to pay off my Camaro and my schedule does n't fit with his . " " Knows his stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the two best I 've had . " Michael had come out of graduate school on the run . The twenty-six articles on his resume got him tenure in 1970 and a full professorship in 1978 , a week before his fortieth birthday . After that he raised his head and began looking around , trying to get the magic back . People still called and asked what he was doing on this or that subject . " Nothing , " he 'd tell them . " On to other things . " " Like what ? " they 'd ask . He kept it vague , enigmatic , matching the drift of his own mind . " I 'm fooling around with Jeremy Bentham 's early work on the pleasure-pain calculus and its applications to problems of contemporary de-mocracy . That stopped them . There 'd be a moment of silence down the long lines of Mother Bell . Then : " I see . Too bad you did n't keep working on the earlier material ; I thought you were on to something with that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that way , a life of slightly unsettled contentment , all right in general but cut through with an aloneness he simultaneously treasured and disliked . He had his work and the Shadow . He had a woman or two he saw occasionally . And then came Jellie Braden . And then came the Trivandrum Mail running southward into traditional India , where the old ways endured . The train pulled into Madurai at ten o'clock . Michael asked about a place to stay , and the conductor directed him to a small hotel just up the street from the station . " Very clean , very pleasant , " he said . Michael trusted him . When he went through the front door the action level cranked up . Most of the small Indian hotels are designed for people traveling in basic Indian ways , white faces being rare at their registration desks . The desk clerk was obviously pleased with Michael 's choice of hotels , and three bellboys were assigned to take him to his room , even though he carried only a knapsack . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile , stopping exactly at Michael 's room and opening the door . Another spoke a little English and said the hotel restaurant was closed , but he would be happy to run down the street and get something . Michael knew he could count on an omelet . He asked the bellboy to fetch one , along with some bread and tea and cheese or yogurt . Twenty-five minutes later the boy returned with tea , bread , yogurt , chutney , and a three-egg omelet . Just where the eggs came from was useless information at that point . Besides , 26 Robert James Waller  | it 's an inquiry Michael never made in India , regardless of the circumstances . After food , sleep . One of the boys knocked on Michael 's door at first light , as requested . Michael cold-showered , had cereal and goat 's milk along with toast and tea in the restaurant , then started looking for a car to take him on to a place called Thekkady in the western mountains .

Michael was n't sure about the significance of that but took it to be a good omen . The driver used a whisk broom to clean off the backseat , and they headed out on the trail of Jellie Braden . The day after Michael first met Jellie at the dean 's reception , somebody somewhere yanked an autumnal lever and the aging rocket ship called college lifted off . He had a Tuesday  --  Thursday teaching schedule but went in even though it was Monday and frittered around . He read mail that had come in his absence , posted his office hours , straightened out the schedules of a few students who could n't get the classes they wanted .

He opened up on Tuesday with his standard lecture , " Complexity and the Boundaries of Human Policymaking , " dazzling the seniors with a little fancy stuff out of combinatorial mathematics . A typical first class session , letting them know this was going to be serious business . Most of the faculty merely handed out syllabi and directions to the restrooms . But he 'd walk in , look at the students , and say , " We begin with complex systems , an examination of our own limited intellects in a contest with unlimited possibili-ties .

It was understood he chose his doorstops carefully and rotated them periodically , a kind of floor-level editorial on the times around him . Quiet rap of knuckles on the open door , and he looked up into gray eyes : Jellie Braden , in tight jeans , red sweater with a white shirt collar peeking out of it , well-traveled hiking boots . Black hair tucked up under a round , short-billed wool cap . He had n't fully appreciated her long legs on Sunday . The skirt and boots she 'd worn to the dean 's party had disguised her lower parts , though he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An old green book bag was slung over her right shoulder . " Hello , Michael Tillman . I was on my way to Jimmy 's office and saw your door open . " He swung his feet off the desk , tossed the computer magazine over his shoulder , and said , " Hello yourself , Jellie Braden . Nice of you to stop by . Come in , sit down , the smoking lamp is lit in here . " " Okay . I have a few minutes before Jimmy 's out of class . " She gave the impression she did n't have anything better to do with a little downtime , but he did n't really think she meant it that way . " Jellie , you look like what the admissions crowd calls a mature student , knapsack and all . " " I am exactly that . Well , a student , anyway . My maturity 's an open question . " He was about to comment on what he saw as her rather obvious maturity but decided not to . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North American Plains Indians  --  Native Americans , as we Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 29  | know them now . Another one in archaeological field methods . I have n't been able to find a job yet , and I 'll be damned if I 'm going to lie around the house all day and watch the soaps . What are you teaching this semester ? " " A senior-level course in decision making and a graduate course in quantitative methods . Hot stuff , you ought to sign up for them . " " I thought you were an economist ? " " I still am , sort of . Got interested in more applied topics a few years ago . Age does that to you . " " It all sounds pretty grubby to me . Something to do with making money and screwing consumers , I 'll bet . " Michael laughed . " Money , maybe . Screwing consumers , no . " How do you separate the two ? It always looks like the same thing to me . " " Good point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm like the old A-bomb scientists ; I just produce the knowledge , what the public chooses to do with it is not my responsibility . That 's rubbish , of course , but it gets me by if I dare to reflect too much on what I 'm doing . " " Well , at least you 're honest about it . Do n't you wear a suit and tie when you 're teaching ? " " No , I used to when I first started . Damn chalk dust gets all over the good material . Besides , this climate 's just too deucedly cold in the winter to dress very fancy . Somehow I never felt right wearing long johns underneath pinstripes . As the tailors say , the cloth does n't hang properly . Jeans and sweaters work out okay . That also bothers the dean , but then just 30 Robert James Waller  | about everything I do bothers the dean , whether I 'm trying to bother him or not . " Michael tapped a pencil on the desk and grinned at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't take to the idea . " Jellie grinned back . " Just what would a dean 's uniform look like ? " " A jumpsuit plus face paint done in what I called manager 's camouflage , ' mottled tones of brown and gray to blend in with filing cabinets and other office equipment . I told him , Arthur , you 'd be able to skulk around and do all kinds of secret things , check up on us to make sure we 're not dancing through the firstfloor lobby with garlands in our hair . ' " Jellie 's grin twisted into a little crooked smile . " Exactly what did the dean say about your idea ? " " He did n't say anything . Just shook his head and walked away . That was after I went on to tell him how the uniform could be coupled with what I called the administrator 's go-squat , ' a modified duck walk that would keep him down at desktop level . I demonstrated the go-squat for him in the hall outside his office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd adopt the uniform and the walk . Guess he did n't grasp the concept . Carolyn liked the idea , however . " Small talk , nothing talk . It went on from there . Jellie began dropping by his office once a week or so , and she and Michael whacked their way toward each other through the old thicket of ignorance separating strangers . Sometimes he had a partial erection just talking to her and was glad he wore his jeans snug , which kind of held events under control . He 'd given up on organized religion years ago , but it 's handy Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 31  | when you need it , and he said over and over to himself , " 0 Absolute , give me Jellie Braden ; somehow You must do as much for a simple man . " The words became a mantra that never left his mind . At the fall picnic on a Sunday , Michael sat on one end of a teeter-totter in a park along the river , languidly watching the accounting department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volleyball tournament organized by the dean and his secretary . His secretary liked Michael even less than the dean did , calling him impertinent . Michael thought about impertinence and factored in cigarette smoking , which the dean complained about . The result popped out : Be gladdened in your heart you have tenure . He was glad , and the sun was late-September pleasant . The economists were anxiously waiting in the wings for their second crack at the marketeers , part of a double-elimination scheme designed by a sports fanatic in the operations research area . The genius had used some fairly high-powered mathematics to make up the pairings based on the departmental won-loss records from the last three picnics and had run off a four-color diagram on one of the Apples . The dean shot up into the far reaches of delirium when he saw the printout and insisted everyone look at " Don 's good work , " as he called it ( an extra two hundred for Don at salary time , Michael guessed ) . Michael thought it was using a sledgehammer to drive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Don 's brilliance . What he said was , " I think DonDon applied high thinking to low living . " Jesus , the faculty was out of shape . Flabby bodies 32 Robert James Waller  | whacking a volleyball into the trees , stumbling around , falling down , the dean tooting on his whistle . He looked to see if the hospital emergency unit was standing by . " Wan na teeter , Tillman-Michael ? " Jellie was coming across the grass toward him , smiling . He 'd seen her earlier from a distance . Anytime he was in the same physical area as Jellie his radar kicked in , and he was aware of her location at all times . She and Jim had arrived an hour earlier . Michael had come alone on the Black Shadow , goosing it a little as he passed the dean 's car on his way into the park and waving to Carolyn when he went by . No Deanette T-shirt this year , and he felt bad for her . That 's why he had a bookstore make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I have the totter end . You 'll have to teeter . That 's the easy part , anyway , and it 's what I do during the week . " He stood up a bit , lowering the other end of the seesaw . He outweighed her by about sixty pounds and scooted up the board to balance things out , then tossed her a beer out of the little six-pack cooler by his feet . " How does Jim feel about his wife sharing an unsanded plank with another man ? " " Mostly he does n't pay any attention to that sort of thing , but he can be jealous in a petulant way sometimes . And for no good reason , I might add . But he likes you and knows we 're friends , so that 's different . Anyway , he 's totally focused on pounding the marketing department to smithereens in the next round of wretchedness over there . " She was luminous in the soft , slanting light of an Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 33  | autumn afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse as they teetered and tottered . Her jeans stretched tight across her hips and thighs where she straddled the board . Did the Absolute build in this much torment as a last delicious bit of private entertainment for Him or Her or Whatever ? Michael Tillman wondered . " No volleyball , Michael ? You look like you 're in good shape , and judging by the pathetic little war going on over there at the net , you 'd be a dominant force . " He glanced toward the net and saw James Lee Braden III in his horn-rims , sweatshirt , and floppy khakis doing side-straddle hops as he warmed up for a second run at the marketeers . Braden III went into the dirt when he tripped over Dr. Patricia Sanchez 's foot . Then he realized he had n't answered Jellie 's question and she was watching him watch her . He took a hit of beer and said , " Nope . I did my four miles on the road this morning at dawn . That 's enough for one day . Besides , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by class time Tuesday . " Jellie Braden laughed , and they went up and down on a September afternoon in Iowa .  | In the countryside west of Madurai the morning was sweet and clear , in the way India feels before the heat and dust come up . Especially sweet and clear , because if it all worked out , Jellie was four hours ahead in the high country of the Western Ghats . Maybe tomorrow would n't be as sweet and clear . Maybe he had no business doing this , following her . The old doubts again , bothering him for this whole trip . Forget it , push on . Jellie had her problems , whatever they were , and Michael had his ? forty-three , sinking toward a time when it would be too late for this kind of thunder in his brain and body . If it came to war , it could be sorted out in the hills of India , as good a place as any . She could send him away , and he 'd be no worse off than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jimmy Braden 's wife running off on some existential quest .  | At Thanksgiving their first year in Cedar Bend , the Bradens invited Michael for dinner . They 'd only been in town for three months , but Jimmy was set on having what he called " a major do . " Jellie protested , saying they did n't know many people and somehow Thanksgiving had always seemed a special time for family and close friends . Her parents were coming from Syracuse , that was probably enough . But Jimmy made up a list , looked at it , and said if twothirds of them came , it would be a respectable show-ing . Jimmy 's list was predictable , safe . He said , " I thought about inviting Michael Tillman , but I doubt if he 'd come . He does n't seem the type for Thanksgiving dinner . Then again , Michael 's single and so is your friend , Ann Frazier , from sociology . They 're both kind of different , maybe we can do a little matchmaking over turkey . " Jellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room table . Strange and different Michael Tillman , big-shouldered and brown-eyed with brown hair longer than the approved length for a business school faculty member . A little something out of the ordinary . Sunburned in the face , almost a workingman 's face , as if he 'd be comfortable cashing his paycheck in a bar across the street from where he might have worked as a ' machinist . And his long , smooth fingers with the faintest imprint of grease even hard scrubbing could n't remove . A month before , she and Jimmy had been coming home from a local theater production . The night streets were wet from October rain , and suddenly  | there was Michael beside them when they stopped for a light . He sat on the Shadow , revving its engine . She remembered the car radio was playing a song by Neil Diamond , " Cracklin ' Rosie , " while Jimmy was telling her to find the public radio station devoting an entire evening to Beethoven . It stuck in her mind , the song playing at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere and hear " Cracklin ' Rosie , " and instantly she was back on the streets of Cedar Bend , looking at Michael on the Shadow . Jimmy had leaned out the window of the Buick and said , " Hi , Michael . " Michael  --  yellow bandanna tied around his head , leather jacket , boots , and jeans  --  turned and waved to the Bradens , then looked straight ahead . When the light changed he gunned the Shadow and was gone , straddling that smooth black machine of his and disappearing into the countryside . Jimmy said , " I think it 's a bit chilly and wet to be riding a motorcycle , do n't you ? " But Jellie did n't hear him . She was watching the Shadow 's taillight moving away from her . And she wanted to be riding with Michael Tillman , to be going out there where she had once traveled and was now afraid to go again . She wanted to climb on that black machine and feel the beat of its engine between her legs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd always had a taste for a peculiar kind of man , the sort that seems ill designed for the world in which they live ( Jimmy is a whole other story  --  those were her break-even years ) . Michael Tillman was like that , she sensed , as if a great fist had reached back and plunked a hard-drinking , hard-  | cussing , nineteenth-century keelboatman into the 1980s , given him an intelligence out beyond where the rest of us live , and said , " Now , behave yourself , " all the while being doubtful that he would . And he did n't . Her taste in men probably had something to do with the genes arching forward from her great-greatgrandmother , Elsa , ? who had been a radical feminist when it was considered improper if not immoral for a woman to think about such things , let alone speak and parade in the streets on behalf of them . Elsa Markham had left her husband , taken up with an equally radical socialist , and gone on the road as a warrior for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't talk much about Great-Great-Grandmother Elsa . Jellie kept that side of herself hidden for a long time . Not totally suppressed , hidden , tucked way back where it could n't get hold of her and disrupt the well-designed life her parents had drafted in clear terms for their two daughters . Jellie 's older sister , Barbara , had shouldered arms and marched straight into that well-designed life . She got her degree in elementary education , married a successful insurance broker , and stayed in Syracuse . The Markhams were pleased with Barbara 's choices , and the world was good . In their late girlhoods , Barbara read Little Women and loved it . Jellie told her it was cloying . Jellie read Madame Bovary and loved it . Barbara told her it was trash . Then she ratted on Jellie and told Mother Markham that Jellie wanted to be Emma Bovary . Mother grabbed Jellie 's copy of Flaubert and read it in one 38 Robert James Waller  | sitting , concentrating on the passages Jellie had underlined . A lecture on virtue followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be like Emma at all and that you could look at Madame Bovary as a kind of primer on how not to live . What she really wanted to say was Emma handled it all wrong by being loose with money . A true romantic would have concentrated on the sex and let it go at that . Given that Elsa Markham 's restless ways had somehow fluttered down to her , it was nearly inevitable Jellie 's life would turn out as it did . Her India experiences early on gave her some pause , however , and Jimmy came along . She was in a space where she needed to paddle flat water for a while , fatigued from the emotional roll and toss high adventure brings with it . Jimmy looked stable , and he was . Jimmy looked comfortable , and he was . Jellie needed peace and quiet . When he proposed she said yes for reasons she was n't sure of , but they had something to do with stability and comfort and peace and quiet . Jellie fought hard against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't leave her alone . Inside the good faculty wife with a degree in anthropology was a keelboatman 's woman who wanted to put her bare breasts against Michael Tillman 's face and feel his mouth come onto them . When Jimmy showed her his list of invitees for Thanksgiving , she hesitated . Her first inclination was to go for comfort and stability . But Elsa Markham took hold of her arm , and Jellie scratched " M. Tillman " at the bottom . " I think that 's a good idea . Ask Michael and see what he says . " She decided at that Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 39  | moment to wear her red dress with the long puffy sleeves if he accepted their invitation . Michael Tillman did n't celebrate holidays  --  any of them  --  but Thanksgiving at the Bradens was a chance to be around Jellie , and he could n't pass it up . Jim had said there would be a few other people , but he and Jellie especially hoped Michael would come , and oh , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in from his morning run , got his dog and cat fed and squared away , then read for a while . Around one o'clock he stood before his bedroom closet and pulled out a gray tweed jacket and a blue , button-down-collar shirt . Most of his ties had fallen onto the closet floor a thousand or so years ago and looked like it , the silk ones wrinkled and dusty . But a dark red wool number , decorated with Save the Turtles rampant on a field of the swimming reptiles , looked like a candidate for resuscitation with the help of a good brushing . He pulled out a pair of wrinkled charcoal slacks and held them up . Malachi , the border collie whowas named after Michael 's favorite professor in graduate school , put his head on his paws and made small , whining sounds . " No dice , huh , Mal-achi ? " Michael turned , showed the slacks to Casserole-the-cat , and asked , " Whaddya think , Cass ? " She blinked , yawned , and headed for the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shoved hangers around , located a pair of presentable jeans , and finished off this exercise in hesitant elegance with gray socks and the old reliable cordovan loafers. 40 Robert James Waller  | He picked up the bottle of red he 'd bought for the occasion and walked the six blocks to the twostory brick the Bradens had purchased . Three cars were parked outside , the Bradens ' Buick was in the driveway . Jim answered the bell , impeccable  --  perfect as it gets  --  in a dark blue pinstripe , white col-lar  --  barred starched shirt with a yellow-and-black polka-dotted tie . At the bottom end were black , lightweight wingtips  --  banker 's shoes . Crisp white hanky in his breast pocket . Michael had already guessed Jimmy Braden came from old money , and today he looked it . " Hi , Michael . Jellie and I are pleased you could come . I think you probably know everyone here except for Jellie 's parents , who flew in from Syracuse . Say , that 's quite a tie ! " Michael hated entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paraded into a room full of people , and he 'd get sort of stupid and uncomfortable almost to the point of appearing bellicose , which he really was n't . His growing years did n't provide him with much experience in entrances , that 's all . A motley little outfit awaited him in the small living room : sociologist ( female , unpartnered , acquaintance of Jellie 's ) , accountant and wife ( " Did you see any cobras ? " ) , the overweight operations research guy with an equally heavy wife and crushing handshake ( double-elimination volleyball genius ) . Patricia Sanchez was in the middle of the sofa , seated next to a guy she dated from the student services office . An older man he took to be Jellie 's father sat on Pat 's other side . It was stuffy warm , with a perfect fire Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 41  | crackling away and everybody looking at him standing in the doorway to the living room . He took a deep breath and wished he could light up , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him by the elbow . " I think everybody here knows Michael Tillman from my depart-ment . " The voices reached toward Michael in ragged unison . He gave them all a little wave and handed the bottle of wine to Jimmy . " Jellie and her mother are in the kitchen . Oh , how clumsy of me , I nearly forgot you have n't met Jellie 's father , Mr. Markham . " Mr. Markham was somewhere over sixty , with bright eyes and a firm hand . He grinned . Michael grinned back and judged Leonard Markham to be all right , as long as you did n't cross him . Through an open door and down the hall he could see Jellie in the kitchen . She looked up , waved , and called , " Hi , Michael , come meet my mother . " He went back to the kitchen while the living room went back to whatever conversations he 'd interrupted . Jellie wiped her hands on a white apron that had HI ! and four tom turkeys with big , floppy red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , whispering , " I 'm so glad you came , " then turned him to the gray-haired woman who was doing something or other with giblet dressing . The kiss and the whisper surprised him , but he chalked it up to holiday spirit . " Mother , this is our friend , Michael Tillman . " Jellie got her looks from her mother . Eleanor Markham was a knock-'em-dead lady about the same age as her husband and with the same gray eyes as Jellie 's . " I 'm glad to meet you , Michael . We 're so 42 Robert James Waller  | pleased Jellie and Jim have made such nice friends in the short time they 've been here . " She turned to Jellie . " Michael 's the one who rides a motorcycle , right ? " Jellie nodded . " Where do you ride it , Michael ? Very far ? " " Oh , here and there . Around town , up to the Great Lakes sometimes , Colorado if I 'm really feeling sporty . It 's an old buzzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're going any distance at all . " " Do n't you live in an apartment , Michael ? Where do you keep the motorcycle during the winter ? " Jellie was stirring gravy , looking over her shoulder at him . " In my living room . " Jellie laughed . Eleanor Markham smiled and asked , " Why on earth do you keep it there ? " " Because it 's too big for the john . " Both of them were laughing now . Michael was grinning , appreciating a nice groove as much as any jazz musician . " Besides , I can work on it there during cold weather , and if the walls start closing in on me , I sit on it and go vroom , vroom . ' When I 'm not using it , my cat likes to sleep on the seat . I live on the first floor of an old place , been living there for ten years . It 's hard to find people in a college town who pay their rent on time , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mother , of course Michael would keep his motorcycle in the living room . It all fits , and it 's perfect ... unlike this damn gravy that wo n't thicken up . " He could see they were busy , so he excused himself and ambled back to the living room , trying to adopt a veneer of sociability , which was just about impossible for Michael Tillman to carry off . The furSlow Waltz in Cedar Bend 43  | nishings were typical and a little better than that ? good postmodern prints , agreeable pottery pieces , an abstract bronze sculpture about eighteen inches high , and a black-and-white print of Edward Weston 's famous portrait of a cabbage , which cost somebody real bucks . A few new chairs , a few old ones . A Mozart quintet came from a system in the den . He looked back once at Jellie , who was still fretting over the gravy , and tried to articulate in his mind what he 'd seen on her face . A blend , maybe , of contentment and weariness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhere else . The sense that she was running a long race she believed she was supposed to run but would rather not have been running at all . " Come over here , Michael . " Pat Sanchez reached out for his hand . He 'd always liked Pat . She 'd fought her way out of the Los Angeles barrios , got her doctorate at Texas , and joined the faculty about ten years before . They 'd done a couple of papers together and ended up naked and laughing and drinking margaritas on her bed when they 'd finished the first one late on a Friday night . After that they 'd gone out a few times , then let go of it by mutual , but unspoken , consent . The mathematics of transportation networks evidently were not enough on which to sustain a loving relationship . She introduced him to her friend , who had recently become vice-president of student services , but the friend already knew Michael from their days on the Student Conduct Committee . He had a therapeutic way about him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasures of dormitory  | havoc and other garbage the university continued to tolerate . He shook Michael 's hand and said , " I remember you . You 're the one who was in favor of expelling anybody who so much as thought about writing on the walls . What was it you said ? . . . I used to quote you as an example of the kind of approach that just does n't work with today 's students . " Michael sighed inside himself , then thought about sticking the sweet fellow 's head up his ass or in the fireplace , depending on whether he decided the coagulated brain ought to be quick-frozen or hardboiled , but let it go and leaned toward him , whispering , " I remember almost exactly what I said . It went something like this : We 're running a university , not a success center or an asylum for those with pounding glands . Cheats are cheats , destructive teenage drunks are just that , and we ought to throw the injurious little bastards all the way back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or boot their asses right down the street to the cops and press charges . ' That 's what I said . I also said I could n't stand all the transactional bullshit you people seem to believe in . That was after someone from counseling services called me a fas-cist . " Sweet Fellow , the veep , turned red while Pat lay back against the sofa cushions , trying to suppress her laughter and failing , and that cooled him down . Michael was glad she was there . He 'd shot his mouth off at a little member of the central administration who did n't know what it was like in the gullies of the world , and it could have ruined Thanksgiving at the Bradens , which was the last thing he wanted to hap-pen.  | " Oh , Michael , will you never be tamed ? " Pat was still laughing , holding her stomach . At that moment Jimmy Braden came out of the kitchen , daintily ringing a small silver bell . " Ladies and gentlemen , dinner is served . " The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear , wondering what the seating arrangements were and whether they 'd be such that he could look at Jellie now and then , preferably often . After all , that 's what he 'd come for , not to deal with smart-ass little brats from the administration building . Place cards were on the table , but he decided to let everyone else find their seats and then sort through the residual . The seat assignments gave the appearance of having come out of a random-number generator . But he knew Jellie too well to doubt there was an overall plan designed to get certain people away from their wives and dates and husbands and next to certain other people . Sort of a turkey-centered mixer . Michael watched people seat themselves , the chairs dwindling down to a precious few . Jellie caught his eye and pointed to the second place down from the head of the table , near the kitchen . He walked over and looked at the name card , which had Possible Dean printed on it in Jellie 's handwriting . The card at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braden III carved , Jellie 's mother poured , Jellie ran back and forth to the kitchen , and everyone else talked nonsense . Michael sat there watching Jellie move , feeling , for the first time , something beyond hibiscus and a waterfall in the Seychelles , thinking that maybe the old Darwinian shuffle 46 Robert James Waller  | had some steps to it he had n't known about before . The physical attraction he felt for her was somehow being melded with deeper and quieter feelings of a higher order , a turn of events he had n't counted on . And he became a little sad then in a way he could n't grasp . Sad for her , for him , for Jimmy , and for where this might all lead or probably would n't . The voice of the Absolute sounded less certain , the mantra was beginning to waver . Some things were better left alone , he thought . He , and perhaps Jellie , if he was reading her correctly , were mucking around in a dangerous place where they had no business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it first appeared . And , for a moment , he wanted to run , to ride the Shadow somewhere , anywhere . Anywhere that had a warm sun and simple ways . The great turkey dance went on for nearly two hours . Wine and more wine , food and more food . Eleanor Markham told a funny story about Jellie 's growing years , and everybody laughed , especially Jel-lie . The female sociologist on his right rattled on about her life and times , touching his arm occasionally when she made what she considered a significant point . That left him feeling cramped and a little aggravated , since he was bound by the circumstances to be polite and could n't look at Jellie out of the corner of his eye while he was talking with this expert on women 's contributions to early American frontier life . Somebody mentioned the afternoon football game between Dallas and Seattle . The sports fanatic from operations research moved into the opening and Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 47  | began citing yardage gained by various running backs , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and keep them from thinking about anything that really matters . Jellie 's mother was filling her in on what her old high school friends were doing now . Jimmy was carving  --  he never ceased carving , it was his life-way . Jellie 's father was talking to the vicepresident of student services about fishing for brook trout in Connecticut . And the sociologist on Mi-chael 's right was asking him if he ever attended the lecture-concert series , saying she always seemed to go alone and did n't like going alone . He said he did n't go because , as far as he could tell , it was always the same person on the bill  --  a " scintillating new " ( usually pubescent ) Korean violinist who flawlessly executed memorized scores . The sociologist was all right , though , lonely in the way most of us were or are , and Michael continued to feign interest in lectures , concerts , and frontier women , once or twice feeling Jellie 's hip against his shoulder when she got up to make a food run to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game coming on in less than forty-five minutes and said he hoped nobody would mind if he watched it . Several others said ( not directly , of course ) they also wanted to see young black men from the coasts have at one another on the plains of Texas , so that was settled . The sociologist straightened her glasses and said quietly to Michael , " All this attention given to athletics is just another capitalist plot to keep the masses occupied , do n't you think ? " He really did n't want to think about it . He did n't 48 Robert James Waller  | want to think about anything except the next touch of Jellie 's hip against his shoulder . But he nodded and said , " You 're probably right . On the other hand , it beats having the proletariat out there stealing hubcaps or sniffing bicycle seats . " She turned her attention to the accountant 's wife a moment later . During a pause while the jock expert was wetting his throat and summoning up more good Sports Illustrated wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you used to be an athlete , did n't you ? That 's what somebody told me . " Jellie followed up . " Michael , is that true ? You 've been holding out on us . " Trapped . He hoped the subject would pass , but it did n't . Jellie 's father pushed it along . " What did you play , Michael ? " The operations researcher , who would n't know how to pull on a jockstrap if it was required of him , had a hunk of turkey halfway into his mouth and was obviously in a state of complete surprise , since Michael seldom mentioned his athletic history . Everyone was looking at him , particularly the sociologist , as if she 'd suddenly discovered the real reason why he did n't attend the lecture-concert series and why he seemed a little barbarous overall . There was nowhere to go . He would have continued to look for a way out , but Jellie said , " Tell us about it , Michael . " She seemed genuinely interested , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine and began . " The short version is this : I grew up in a small town in South Dakota ? " Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 49  | The accountant 's wife interrupted him . " Where was that ? " " Custer . . . just outside of Rapid City in the Black Hills . " " It 's pretty out there , is n't it ? " With a mind like chaff in a high wind , she was now into travelogues . The sociologist came out of her corner with a hard leftist jab : " It 's where we stole the Native Americans ' land in the nineteenth century . " " Yes , it 's very pretty , " Michael said , looking at the accountant 's wife . " Though unfortunately my parents ' small house sat on land stolen from the Lakota Sioux . " He waited a moment for additional questions about the Black Hills . There were none . " By the time I got to eighth grade I was totally bored with school and small-town life in general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then my father helped me put up a basket in the backyard of our house . He took a real interest in the whole affair and installed a yard light so I could practice in the evenings . I seemed to have a knack for the jumpshot and got pretty good at it . My high school coach had graduated from Wichita State and sent them films of two or three of my better games . They offered me a scholarship , which was about the only way I was going to get to college . I played there for three and a half years until I banged up my knee pretty bad . That 's it . " He took another drink of wine and waited for the assemblage to move on to matters of greater importance , but they would n't let it go . " What position did you play , Michael ? " " Guard . " 50 Robert James Waller  | " What are you , about six three ? " " Six two , in my socks . " " Were you an All-American or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Team my junior year . " Jellie put her hand on his and squeezed it . " Michael , you were a star , then ! " He could n't tell if she was being genuine or mildly sarcastic . He hoped it was the latter and decided it was , with just a little bit of the former mixed in . " I never thought of it that way . I was just earning room and board , books and tuition . " " I 'll bet your parents were very proud of you . Ever think about turning pro ? " The operations researcher had found a real live veteran of wars that mean nothing , right at the Thanksgiving table . " My dad pasted pictures of me from the Wichita Eagle all over Tillman 's Texaco . My mother was more concerned about my grades . She always thought athletics was a pretty dumb way for people to spend their time . " The operations researcher had batted only one for two and was troubled by that . He plainly wondered how any mother could not love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lights of several hundred gymnasiums during his formative years and felt sorry for Michael , believing he 'd been deprived of maternal affection . " As for becoming a professional , I had no interest , plus my first step was n't quick enough for the big leagues . The phone from the pros never rang , and I would n't have answered it if it had . "  | " Do n't you miss playing , Michael ? " Jellie 's mother was looking at him . " No , I do n't , Mrs. Markham . I truly do n't . In fact , I could n't wait for it to be over so I could get on with my life . Somewhere around my sophomore year in college I discovered I did n't like playing basketball and never really had . I just liked fooling around with the art and physics of the long-range jumpshot . It was a boy 's tool for a boy 's game , and I have n't touched a basketball in twenty years . " Jelly said , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long-range jumpshot is all that really mattered . Michael , you ought to do an article on that sometime . " If Jellie had put her hand back on his at that moment , he 'd have written an essay about now-fading jumpshots on the linen tablecloth with a turkey bone . But she did n't and changed the conversation by listing the selection of desserts available . Michael went for sour cream raisin pie . Jellie had made it from her grandmother 's recipe , and it was a knockout . Over coffee and brandy , someone asked Jellie about her name and where it came from . Her parents laughed , and Jellie pointed at both of them . It fell to her mother to tell the story . " When Jellie was about seven years old , she went through a plump stage . Her father started calling her his little bowl of Jelly . ' The neighborhood children picked it up and teased her by calling her Jelly-Belly and Jellyroll and Jellybean and just about everything else you could imagine . She used to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon 52 Robert James Waller  | as that began happening , Leonard quit calling her Jelly and felt bad he 'd ever started the whole business . But the kids would n't drop it . " Jellie came on line . " Mom bailed me out , though . She convinced me that my nickname was spelled with an i-e on the end instead of a y and that it was really a French name pronounced with a soft J  --  JahLAY ? even though we kept the American pronunciation . I liked that idea and began to take pride in my new name . It stuck with me , and I 've used it ever since . " " Then what 's your real name ? " For God 's sake , Michael thought , looking at the accountant who had been dumb enough to ask the question . Leave it alone . If she wanted you to know , she 'd already have mentioned it . " I never tell . " Jellie laughed . " Jimmy , everyone needs more brandy . I 'll get some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their jockstraps , backward , of course , and get the television cooking : " Third-and-six on the Dallas five . Heeerrre 's the pitch-out .... " The sociologist had papers to grade , Pat Sanchez and her date decided on a walk . Jellie and her mother were cleaning up in the kitchen . Michael went outside for a smoke , and when he returned the rest of them , except Jellie and her parents , were watching the game . Michael sat at the dining room table with Leonard Markham and asked about fishing for brook trout , saying he used to do a little trout fishing in the Black Hills . Mr. Markham knew how to talk about what interested him , giving Michael the right amount of information without getting boring . He 'd have made a good teacher instead of the paper box manufacturer Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 53  | he was , Michael thought . He liked Leonard Mark-ham . Later , Jellie and her mother joined them at the table , Jellie sitting across from Michael . This is what he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markham Braden on a cold autumn day in 1980 . He was careful , though , because once or twice her mother caught him staring at Jellie in a way not related to the conversation . And mothers know about the secret thoughts of men , particularly when those thoughts concern the daughters of the mothers . Struggling for something to talk about , Michael brought up India and watched Eleanor Markham 's face go dark just a little , but still there  --  when " he mentioned it . Jellie quickly turned the conversation in a different direction . That was the second time he 'd picked up something strange about her India days . Something that made her reluctant to go into it other than acknowledging she 'd been to India and stayed for three years . Michael could only tolerate being in Jellie 's general vicinity for relatively short periods of time back then . His feelings toward her were just too overpowering , escalating in intensity minute by minute , and he was half-afraid he 'd blurt out something obvious and stupid , some unseemly remark tipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way he felt . He wanted to be able to see her , be around her as often as he could , without feeling any more surreptitious than he already did . So about six o'clock he excused himself under the pretense of going home to feed his animals . Jellie wrapped her arms around herself and shiv-54 Robert James Waller  | ered on the front steps when she said good-bye to him . " Thank you for coming , Michael . I know these affairs are n't your style , but I wanted my parents to meet you . You 're a different sort than they normally come into contact with . . . . I did n't say that quite right . I did n't mean to imply you 're a curiosity piece , just that you 're different . My dad said to me a few minutes ago , I like that Michael Tillman ; he 's got some fiber to him . ' I knew he 'd like you . " Michael understood what she meant . " I like him , too , Jellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice time . " He could n't help looking hard at her once more before leaving . He just could n't help it , wanting to put his arms around her and say , " Do n't go back in the house . Come home with me , I 'll kiss your mouth and your breasts and what surely is your soft , round belly and tear you to pieces and put you back together again . Afterwards we 'll go down the road , far away , does n't matter where . " Jellie set her gray eyes on Michael 's for maybe five seconds , her face almost serious . A different look than she 'd ever given him before , as if she were half seeing into his thoughts . She said nothing , just looked at him , then dropped her eyes and smiled a little before opening the door and going back inside . A year later he was west of Madurai and pushing hard into southwest India looking for her . The driver spoke only a few words of English , so it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open windows . Fifty miles out the driver stopped , went over to a roadside shrine , and left some coins . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 55  | " Bad spirits , " he said , getting in . " Evil . " He shifted gears , looking back at the shrine . In Virudunagar the driver had breakfast and the car had a flat tire . Apparently the donation at the shrine had been insufficient . The spare was shot , so it took a major expedition through the streets until a garage was located . After the obligatory haggling over price , the tire was hauled to the shop and coldpatched . That 'll be good for another sixty miles , Michael thought . Their stop in Virudunagar had taken nearly two hours . Michael leaned back on the red vinyl car seat and looked at villages and farm country going by . Near Rajapalaiyam the driver slowed and halted on a bridge over a wide , shallow river . A woman ahead of them was driving a flock of geese across the bridge . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were doing laundry , waving clothing over their heads and slapping it hard against rocks . The geese were almost across , moving slowly . Too slowly for the driver . He honked . The woman pushing the geese along turned , giving them a nasty look . Only rich folks rode in cars , and she was having none of it . The beat of life in village India is in adagio time . Only rich folks from somewhere else are in a hurry . A woman came toward them across the bridge . She wore a torn red sari of the cheapest cloth , toe rings on her brown feet , and carried a load of sticks on her head . One arm was raised to balance the load , the other swung beside her , bracelets jingling . She was stunning . Beautiful by any standards anywhere . 56 Robert James Waller  | The way Bardot looked in her salad days . She glanced through the car window at Michael , and he smiled , could n't help smiling . He thought she might smile back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then turned her head and stared straight down the road as she moved past the car . He leaned forward and saw the Western Ghats rising up far ahead . Somewhere in those mountains was Jellie , near a place called Thekkady , or at least she was supposed to be there . And what she was doing there he did n't know and still was n't sure he wanted to find out . An hour more and they were into the foothills , climbing slowly and carefully around hairpin curves , waiting for huge , roaring Indian tour buses demanding the road and giving no quarter . Cooler now . Three thousand feet , maybe , pine trees right outside the car windows . Michael did n't know Jellie had walked this same road in terror fifteen years earlier . She had called herself by another name then .  | Following her first Thanksgiving in Cedar Bend , Jellie did n't stop at Michael 's office for nearly two weeks . Her pattern had been to come by for coffee and a smoke at least once a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jellie and maybe other people were beginning to see how he felt and she 'd decided to quash anything and everything of that sort right at the front end . When Jimmy Braden called and asked if they could talk for a few minutes , he was sure Jellie had said something to him . He sat there waiting for the blows , waiting for Jimmy to say Jellie was uncomfortable with the way he looked at her and that she would n't be stopping by anymore , let alone sending invitations to subsequent Thanksgiving dinners . But Jimmy did n't want that . In some ways the news was worse . He was going to teach in London  | for the spring semester , and Jellie was going with him . He 'd applied for a visiting professorship the previous year and cut a deal with Arthur on his way in , allowing him to do the London job if it came through . His application had been lost in the British bureaucracy . But finally it had worked out at the last minute . Now Jimmy was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover his absence . Michael had a tight gut just thinking about Jellie being out of his sight for that long , thinking about her black hair blowing in winds coming off the North Sea , about her laughing and going to the theater and never thinking of him , though there was no particular reason she should . Selfish stuff , he knew that , but he recovered and said he 'd pick up Jimmy 's intro-level course in econometrics or find a graduate student who could do it . Jimmy promised to reciprocate some time , and Michael had no doubt he would . " Thanks a lot , Michael . That fixes everything up . We 're leaving in ten days , right after the semester is over , be back in August . We 're going to travel during the summer . " Jellie in Scotland , Jellie along the hedgerows , Jellie in Paris . . . Jellie where he could n't see her . An hour later she rapped on Michael 's door . " Hi , motorcycle man . How 's the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm whipping the students up the hills of December , and victory is mine , or will be in less than two weeks . " She stood in the doorway instead of coming in and flopping down on a chair the way she usually did . " Sorry I have n't been by to say hello . I 've been Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 59  | getting ready for my final exams , and Jim said he told you about the London trip . God , what a mess , finding a house sitter on short notice , getting bills paid and things set up at the bank . I 've been running for days with no letup . What are you going to do over the holidays ? Any big plans ? " " No , not much at all . It 's too damn cold to crank up the bike and ride it someplace . I 'll probably try to finish the paper I 'm doing on comparing complex structures so I can present it at the fall meetings . Get my trimonthly haircut , spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . Other than that , watch the snow fall , I guess , and listen to the Miles Davis tapes I ordered while I spruce up my lectures for the class I 'll be covering for Jim . My notes in that area are a little yellowed . It 'll go by pretty fast , it always does . " He wanted to say he 'd be thinking about her every other minute , but he did n't . " Sounds pretty low key . No special Christmas wishes ? " He looked at the ceiling for a moment , struggling , trying to pull himself up and out of a selfindulgent funk . Michael had wishes all right , but nothing he could talk about . He recovered and leaned back in his chair , fingers locked behind his head , forcing a little grin . " Well , sometime I 'd like a leather belt with Orville tooled on the back . Used to be a guy in Custer had one , and I thought it was pretty neat when I was a kid . " Jellie grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people I know , would say something like that . God , it 's almost surreal . " " Well , life is surreal , Jellie . Except for Orville. 60 Robert James Waller  | He did n't dwell on those things , just drove his grain truck and whistled a lot . " " I think Orville had it all worked out . I 'd like to hear more about him , but I 've got to run . I 'll try to stop in before we leave . Take care , Michael , and say hello to Orville if you see him . Ask if he 'll write a self-help book for the rest of the world . " He watched her jeans as she left and walked down the hall , then got to his feet and went to the door so he could watch her a little while longer . She looked back once , as if she knew he 'd be standing there and fluttered her hand in a final wave as she turned the corner , heading for the office of solid , steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small shopping area near the campus . They had coffee at Beano 's , sitting in a back booth in midafternoon . Her exams were over and preparations for London were well along , so she was a little calmer and seemed in no hurry this time . She was wearing one of her standard winter outfits : jeans , long-sleeved undershirt beneath a flannel shirt , down vest . He leaned against the wall , one foot on the seat of the booth , and glanced at all the old posters of campus events plastered on the walls . The undergrad-uates  --  those who were finished with exams and some who were n't  --  were drinking beer . Two men , gay activists from the philosophy department , were playing chess at a table next to them . Jellie asked if he had any suggestions for London restaurants . He told her , except for a day here and there on his way through , his experience with London  | was mostly limited to making connections at Heathrow and he did n't know the city well . Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West , and most of his traveling had been in southeast Asia . He did n't mention the women in Bangkok with their long hair and compliant ways . He glanced at his watch and said he had to give his last final examination in twenty-two minutes , starting to make departure motions . " Michael , I 'll miss our talks over coffee , and I 'll miss you , truly I will . " He looked at her for a long while . For the first time he really did n't care what she or anyone else thought about him looking at her in a certain way . She took a deep breath and started to say something , then paused for a moment before continuing , as if she were trying to decide whether or not to speak at all . " I do n't want to get deeply into this now , but . . . " She hesitated . His hands were shaking for reasons he was n't sure of , and he held them under the table where she could n't see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle , just below his left eye . In the spaces of a man 's life there are moments when things shift into some other gear . He sensed that was happening now . " What are you talking about , Jellie ? What do n't you want to get into ? " " What I 'm trying to say . . . is that . . . that I 'm not going to just miss you . I 'm going to miss you . I know more than you may think I know about how you feel about some things . . . how I feel . . . Oh , good God , I 'm making a muddle of this .... " He got his hands quieted down and reached for  | one of hers . She put it out to meet him halfway . He laid his other hand on the little bundle forming on the table . " C'm on , Jellie , say what you 've got to say . I want to hear it , whatever it is . " " Michael , it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get across . If I 'm wrong , please forget I ever said it . Promise ? " " I promise . " She added her other hand to the stack on the table and stared at them , cleared her throat . " Behind all the laughter and light talk we share with each other , there 's something else going on , is n't there ? " He stayed quiet , looked at her . She had the stage , and he was n't about to climb up on it right at the moment . He wanted her to finish what she had to say , to let it run wherever it was going . Good or bad , it was time for that . A waitress going into the kitchen dropped a stack of dishes , and every head in Beano 's , except two , turned to see the disaster . He could see the second hand on his watch going by . Fifteen minutes until his examination on the other side of campus . " Damnit . . . is n't there ? There 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She squeezed his hands in both of hers and rapped them lightly on the table . He nodded . " It 's been there since we first met at the dean 's reception in late Augusta , has n't it ? " He nodded again and talked straight : " You walked through the door and something started to hum inside me . The hum has now escalated into a symphonic scream I ca n't turn off . " " Oh , Michael . . . Michael . " She looked away  | from him , at the wall , then at the ceiling . Twelve minutes to exam time . He did n't move . The last fly of a summer past , surviving on the largesse of Beano 's , landed on his coffee cup and walked an endless path around the rim . " My mother saw it at Thanksgiving , something about the way you were looking at me , and I guess the way I looked back . No , that 's not being honest enough  --  I was looking back at you the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes in the kitchen , she mentioned it to me and said , Be careful , Jellie , be very careful . ' " Two forty-seven . Beano 's was clearing out as about half the crowd hustled off to the three o'clock exams . " Michael , maybe this will all settle down while I 'm gone . It just has to , does n't it ? " He said nothing , shrugging his shoulders , smiling at her . She stood , pulling on her parka and mumbling , " I feel like a schoolgirl . " She looked down at him . " I 'm glad I said what I said , Michael . And I 'm glad you said what you said and for the way you 've handled it the past few months . You like to think you 're a little rough around the edges , but you 're actually pretty smooth . You 're a damn fine man , Michael Tillman , attractive and kind and everything else  --  is n't there a woman out there somewhere for you ? I mean someone other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? could n't bring herself to say it , though he wished she had said it  --  and let her voice circle down to nothing . " I understand what you mean . Who knows ? All I know now is how I feel about you . " He picked up his coat and started sliding out of the booth , disori-64 Robert James Waller  | ented , thinking the distance to next August could only be measured in light-years . She bent over and kissed him on the cheek . " Ride easy . I 'll send you a card . " And she was gone then , working her way through the tables and out the front door of Beano 's . He left two bucks on the table and began an easy run through the campus , feet on the sidewalk , mind and heart somewhere else . Across the creek , along the duck pond , and only one minute late into a room where he would ask of students what they knew .  | The Bradens lifted off for England on December 20 , the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving was momentarily lightened by several strong performances in both the decision-making and quantitative methods courses . He expected good work from the graduate students , but the undergraduates overcame their senior blues and rose to the task , surprising and pleasing him . The old Shadow crouched in the living room , waiting for the turn of wrenches and better weather . Michael stacked exam papers on its seat and cranked up the computer , which shared the desk with greasy tools and unwashed coffee cups . A few taps on the keys and the GradeCalc program came up . In went the scores , GradeCalc churned away for thirty seconds , and out came final distributions , normal curves , 66 Robert James Waller  | standard deviations , and all that other good stuff , most of which he ignored in his grading . Two hours later , the final grade sheets with one whole cover page of instructions that would make a computer blink  --  instructions he did n't read and had n't read for all fifteen years of teaching and apparently did n't need to read since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had twenty minutes to drop off the grades before the registrar shut down at four-thirty . Coat on , over to the campus , turn in the grades . Done . Free , for a month . Fifteen years of doing this , another twenty to go unless the dean could prove professional incompetence , which he could n't , or charged Michael with moral turpitude , which he would n't , because the entire university except for the accounting department would be out on its ear if those standards were enforced . Stay away from the coeds in your classes  --  that was the main rule for survival , put down with no punches pulled by the former dean , an old guy who had hired Michael fresh out of graduate school . Way before sexual harassment started flashing in the front of everyone 's mind , the old dean had a famous lecture he gave to young faculty members , the males , that is . The essence of it went something like this : Gentlemen , I know you 're all adults , but let me remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young women are traditional midwestern girls , and they expect to take you home to meet Mother and Father on the weekend following bedroom activity , with  | wedding announcements to be mailed soon after . Forget about the air of sophistication they seem to exude . The coeds are big trouble , I mean big trouble . The undergraduate males are a bunch of donkeys , mostly , and you 're going to look sleek and worldly to the coeds , and they 're going to look pretty good to you . Some of them will sit in the front row in short skirts with paradise twinkling at you . You 'll have plenty of opportunities for good times between the sheets ? it 's a goddamn cafeteria out there  --  but forget it , at least until they 're no longer in any of your classes , and I would strongly recommend you stay away from them altogether . I have problems enough without sobbing young women sitting in my office and claiming you discriminated against them in your grading because of some kind of confusion involving preconjugal folderol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief and I 'll kick your butts down the academic mountain and see you never work in this business again . It was a lecture on how to avoid trouble , not develop sensitivity toward females . Michael was sure the latter issue never crossed the old dean 's mind , given the faculty was 99 percent male . Having said that much , the dean told them the famous story that had been part of the university saga for twenty-five years . Seems one of the Russian teachers was in his office when a coed came in to see him .  | He motioned for her to sit down and said he 'd be with her in a moment , all the while intently finishing some piece of work he had on his desk . When he looked up , she was standing there in the buff with the office door shut . The issues were a little complicated , but the nub of it was this : Give me a passing grade or I 'll scream . You want cool under pressure ? You want big cojones ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have been a neurosurgeon or a space commando . He got up , threw open the door , and walked forthwith into the hall , where he pointed in at the young woman and shouted in heavily accented English , " Get out of my office . Now ! " Passersby were treated to a reasonably decent glimpse of a reasonably good , young female body ( that 's part of the saga , anyway , though Michael noticed that as the story was carried forward and repeated , her physical attributes approached Amazonian proportions , her body filling out and improving with age , as it were ) . He 'd always wondered just what lesson should be drawn from the tale , since it never had been clear whether or not the young woman and the Russian had anything going on the side . But , having told it , the dean shooed the junior faculty out of his office and left them with the following two guidelines for not letting their moral turpitude drift : Keep your pants zipped and your office door open . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . The other one-third cut a swath like a combine through the waving fields of coed grain and apparently suffered little for it , partly  | because those peering out from glass houses have no interest in chucking accusatory rocks at others . Michael left the coeds alone , simply because he did n't find them attractive . Too young , too naive , and what the hell do you say to them in the morning ? " Who do you have for Western civ ? " C'rnon . So the grades were in , and Michael was unfettered until January 17 , when he 'd do it all over again . Down the halls of the administration building he went , admiring the waxed oak floors , inhaling the vapors of incompetent power radiating from the walls and oozing from under darkened doors like smoke from a burning village where truth and beauty had once been found . The temporary lightness he 'd felt after finishing a good set of exams was dissipating as he thought about Jellie Braden . He was getting angry at her for going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to mourn her absence . Irrational ? Of course it was irrational . He had no right to anything other than what he already had when it came to her , which was nothing . She 's sitting in Kennedy now , he thought , waiting for TWA to take her lovely body and equally lovely soul onto nine months of new experiences and different people . Maybe she was right , maybe her absence would do it , get him cooled off and refocused on something other than her . Then he started to waffle : " Come back , come back , Jellie Braden . I need to look at you one more time , just one . I want to continue the conversation we started . I want to hear more of how you feel about me and for us to get the air cleared . " But the mail  | does n't come on Sundays , and James Lee Braden III had taken his wife on to foreign pleasures , leaving Michael Tillman foundering in his wake . As he passed by the provost 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastebaskets . Michael glanced inside . Clarice Berenson , the pro-vost 's secretary , stared at a computer screen . The office was empty except for her . They went back a ways , Clarice and Michael . She 'd come home to Cedar Bend from New York when her gynecologist husband dumped her for a psychiatric nurse . After the bad scene with her former husband she had a negative attitude toward men overall . But she and Michael got together occasionally , and they flew pretty close to the sun when they were rolling . Clarice was into serious opera and worked parttime on an M. A. in Spanish , and that along with her job kept her busy . But now and then she liked to shake it real hard . That 's where Michael came in , and their schedules seemed to work in perfect sync when it came to getting crazy . Clarice looked up , grinning . " Well , it 's the campus rebel with no apparent cause . How you doin ' , Michael ? " " Not bad . Just turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Clarice ? " " Since the provost-sir flew off to Los Angeles about two hours ago , things have picked up quite a bit . I 'm just shutting down . Want to have a beer ? " " Better than that , how about beer and dinner ? " " Now you 're talking , Michael . We could even  | take it up another level and go jump around at Beano 's tonight . Bobby 's Blues Band is playing there , starting at nine . It 'll be end-of-the-semester nuts , but that suits me just fine . " " You 're on . But first I need to clean up a bit . Say , about seven ? Go down to Rossetti 's for pasta , then over to Beano 's for the fun ? " " Perfect . I 'll pick you up , I think it 's my turn to drive . " " Okay , see you in a little while . " Michael started drinking beer when he got home . Sat on the Shadow with a Beck 's dark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malachi stood up and put his paws on Michael 's leg . He rubbed Malachi 's ears while the music played , thinking about Jellie Braden flying through the darkness away from him . But those kinds of thoughts were n't fair to Clarice , he decided , and two more beers got him away from his loneliness and into the evening . . . kind of . Clarice was not Jellie Braden when it came to looks . On the other hand , that was also a little unfair , since to Michael 's way of thinking nobody compared with Jellie along that dimension . But Clarice had that same indefinable quality we lump under " class , " and she was more than just presentable . And , just as important , she was not on her way to London . Clarice knocked on his door at ten to seven while he was pulling on a white cotton turtleneck that worked pretty well with faded jeans . She came in and got a beer from the fridge . He padded around barefoot , looking for a clean pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room , Clarice  | was perched on the Shadow , wearing a maize-colored sweater and forest green corduroys tapering down just above her dainty tassel loafers . " Lookin ' good , Clarice , real good . " He said it and he meant it , with three bottles of beer propelling the warmth of the compliment even further than he might have taken it otherwise . " Thank you , Professor Tillman . How 's the winter repair job on the bike coming along ? I see you have the chain off and hanging over the back of a chair . " " Aw , the old guy is in need of constant attention these days . Parts are getting just about impossible to find , but the mail-order catalogs keep him going . If I have to , I 'll start running off my own parts at a machine shop somewhere . He and I are together for life . " " Well , I 'm glad somebody is . " The divorce still hurt , Clarice never tried to pretend otherwise around him . " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back her dark blond head , took a drink of beer , and gave him a lickerish grin . They both knew what was coming down before the night was over . " Thought I might ride up along Lake Superior . I have n't been there for a while . It 's kind of pretty and not too crowded if you stay away from the big holidays . Wan na go with me ? " He was n't sure why he made the offer . He usually preferred traveling alone , but he was feeling deserted and left behind , and Clarice was looking especially good that night . He liked Clarice a lot . She knew his travel habits and looked surprised , little quizzical smile on her face . " Maybe . . . when are you going ? "  | " I can go just about anytime , since I do n't teach summer school anymore . If you 're interested , we can work it out to your schedule . Ready to rumble ? " The spaghetti was good . They took their time over dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the maelstrom that was Beano 's around nine-thirty . Bobby had the Blues Band cooking : " Put on your high-heeled sneakers , Mama , and your wiglet on your head/Put on your highheeled . . . " Drummer , lead guitar , bass , Bobby singing and playing harmonica . And , of course , Molly Never ( that 's what she claims her parents named her ) absolutely screaming on electric violin , legs apart , black heels and black stockings , black miniskirt , purple blouse . She looked like a funky Peter Pan who had been around the darker side of life . The band hit 115 decibels and headed up from there . Bobby 'd had this same band for twelve years , and they operated with a hard , disciplined precision . He shouted over the microphone , " Here 's a song made famous by three black girls from Memphis , now to be sung by three white boys from small towns in the Midwest . That 's why you pay Beano 's exorbitant cover charge , to hear that kind of shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael stood off to the side , waiting for a table to open up , which could take hours . She was screaming at him , him at her , as they tried to talk over the searing lead guitar of one Doppler Donovan , who wore a cowboy hat on his head and militaryissue , jungle-style combat boots on his feet . Bobby had gone into a honky version of a Chuck Berry skip as he slid into his harp solo , amplifier cord looking as 74 Robert James Waller  | if it were coming out of his mouth where he held a small microphone against the harmonica . Michael looked over at the booth where he and Jellie had sat a week ago . It was occupied now by two couples engaged in a pairwise beer-chugging contest . Her words floated through the smoke and the noise of Beano 's : " There 's something else going on between us , is n't there , Michael ? " Clarice slipped her arm around his waist and hugged him , bouncing up and down to the beat . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But Michael was n't comfortable on dance floors , never had been , so he was waiting for the second round of beer drinking to override the spaghetti and give him courage . A student staggered up , towing a platinum blonde wearing greased-on jeans and a black leather jacket . Ghastly beer breath washed Michael 's cheeks as the student shouted over the music , " Great class , Dr. Tillman , absolutely great . How 'd I do ? " Michael did n't post grades , particularly in Beano 's . But what the hell , beer breath had done all right , and it was party time . He held up one of Beano 's custom napkins and pointed to the B on it , grinning . The student threw both arms over his head in joy and spun back onto the dance floor , where he went into a ponylike boogaloo , pawing the air . Five minutes later he sent the waitress over with two draws for Michael and Clarice . It was semester 's end , and they were all burying the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sort of like a New Orleans funeral at ten thousand watts . Doppler DonSlow Waltz in Cedar Bend 75  | ovan led the band into something called the " Drake Neighborhood Slide , " and Clarice pulled Michael out on the dance floor . The evening closed as he knew it would  --  warm , libidinous , and thoroughly satisfying . He and Clarice were good in bed together , and before it was over she was kneeling on the bed , palms and breasts and face pasted against the wall , with him behind her licking the perspiration off her shoulders and doing several other things that pleased her greatly , as she constantly and fervently emphasized while all of this was under way : " Yes , Michael . . . goddamnit , yes , yes , yes ! "  | Jellie from a distance . The ambiguity of those months she was in England was hard on him . His running shoes slushed along the streets of Cedar Bend , and ice clung to his hair where it stuck out beneath his blue stocking cap . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the lights of Christmas and the warming of the earth in April . Gray muck draped like a shroud over Bingley Hall , ceiling lights bright and cold . Wind from the Canadian prairies smacked the building 's north side and howled through the corridors when an outside door was opened . Unlike wine , or the coed of legend who removed her duds in a Russian professor 's office , a midwestern winter does not improve with age . Thinking almost constantly about Jellie , Michael Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 77  | pushed the students hard and even held an extra threehour class on a Sunday afternoon , promising them time off for good behavior later in the semester . He knew he 'd begin to lose them and himself when the warm came again , so they were getting the hard stuff out of the way early . They hammered onward . By February 's close he was thinking of calling for mass , campuswide psychotherapy to counter the late winter blahs . But they hung on , as ancient sailors in pounding seas clung to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Then over the bare trees fluttered the first sign of hope in the form of colorful travel brochures pinned to hallway bulletin boards . The words and pictures promised sun and sand , tonic and tans , and , somewhat more slyly , fast times amid the palms of Florida or the south Texas coast . The classroom buzz as they waited for the bell ran to snow conditions in Colorado and who was driving which twelve people to South Padre Island in an old Dodge van . By that time Michael had frightened the lower 20 percent of the class into filing drop slips . Those remaining were a group of battle-scarred veterans , deserving of a short rest before he bullwhacked them up the slopes of learning toward victory , and maybe graduation . The inevitable questions came : " Professor Tillman , is it all right if I miss your Thursday class before spring break ? A bunch of us are going to Daytona Beach , and we want to leave Wednesday night . " He looked at the nice young woman who asked the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all ran together after a while  --  and said , " Why  | do you think I dragged you in here for an extra three hours on a Sunday afternoon ? Yes , you may leave early , but get the notes for my dazzling lecture on matrix transposition from someone , because I 'm not going to repeat it after you get back . " He grinned at her . " Now get out of my hair and leave me alone . I have serious work to do in saving a world having no interest in being saved . " Friday came , beginning of spring break . Gusty March winds late in the month , minivans and station wagons filled with impatient spouses lined up outside the building , motors running , waiting for classes to end . The library was nearly empty , except for graduate students catching up on their work and junior professors slogging their way toward a tenure decision . By the time Michael got out of Bingley at five , the campus was quiet . At home he leaned back in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of corkboard above his desk . She looked out at him , standing by a stone wall in Ireland , in her hiking clothes , hair tucked under her round tweed hat with the little bill , leather bag over her left shoulder . She 'd mailed him a card saying hello and not much else in late January . The photo came a month later , accompanied by a neutral-sounding note in her small , neat handwriting : 2/21 Hi , Michael . We took a long weekend and came over to Ireland to scout things out for a more extended trip this l  | summer . I hope your spring is going well . Crave our coffee talks and miss you . Jellie He noticed she did n't underline " miss " in the way she had said it in Beano 's just before she left . Maybe that was looking too hard for what did n't exist . Jellie was n't coy , and what she said about getting cooled down might be working  --  for her , at least . For Michael , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat there and stared at it for hours , thinking and wanting . He just did n't see how he could go on living his life without Jellie Braden next to him all the time . Five months to go , and she 'd be back . He could n't wait for her to return and never wanted to see her again , all at the same time . He kept trying to conjure up ways to defend his psyche against the assaults she made on it without even trying , but he failed and sat there waiting for August . And it came eventually , August has a way of doing that . The summer had passed in kind of a quiet haze . One of those periodic budget crises took hold of the university , the provost 's office went into a frenzy , and Clarice had to delay her vacation until autumn . For some reason Michael did n't feel like going up to Lake Superior and instead took the Shadow on a long run into the pretty back roads of the Smokies , enjoying the steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty times since his father had given it to him . He jogged through the streets of Cedar Bend at 80 Robert James Waller  | first light before the heat settled in , staying in shape , beating back the years , though it was getting harder to do . Slowly he could feel his legs going , and on rainy days the old knee injury flashed little twinges of pain as a reminder of his boyhood follies . Sometimes he went by the Bradens ' two-story brick . Quite often he did that . Running , then stopping for a moment , looking at the front steps where he and Jellie had stood the previous Thanksgiving , remembering the subtle , unspoken signals they 'd both sent that night without being sure the other was receiving them . In June he wrote a piece on the role of tax incentives in attacking large-scale social problems . The Atlantic surprised him by taking it , sending a check for $1,200 . He knocked out a heavy-duty , academic version of the article for the Journal of Social Issues , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected as the publication date . Michael knew his department head would dismiss the first as catering to popular taste and the second as not having sufficient stature in the field of economics , though it was an okay journal in its own niche . But he did n't much care anymore what members of the administration thought about his work , so none of that bothered him . By mid-August he was wired tight . East of him a 747 would be loading at Heathrow one of these days , Jellie settling onto her seat with a book , Jimmy Braden running around the cabin looking for a pillow and blanket . She 'd once said Jimmy was a master at sleeping on airplanes but absolutely panicked and could n't sleep at all without his pillow and blanket . So rounding up his bedroom gear was always his first chore after boarding . Michael could picture Jellie in Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 81  | her demure , wire-rimmed reading glasses , glancing at a book , then out the window as the big plane lifted off and brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , and Michael was in his office fussing around , hoping he might see Jimmy Braden , which would be his signal Jellie had returned . The phone rang . " Hello , Michael , how are you ? " Her voice was warm , soft , the diction clear and crisp as always , except when she was sitting in Beano 's talking to a man about secret things she felt and thought he might also feel . " Jellie  --  are you back or what ? " He noticed his voice shook just a little , and he did n't like it . American males have their standards , after all . " Yes , we got in late last night . Jimmy 's still sleeping , but I 'm all fouled up timewise , so I 've been up since four o'clock wandering around . Did you get the picture I sent ? " " I did indeed . Thank you . You looked well and happy . " He did n't say anything about hanging it on his wall . This was an intricate dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , not wanting to open up things too rapidly . " Yes , I am feeling well . I ran into one of my old friends from India on the tube in London . She got me back into yoga , and it does wonders for my body and my mind . " Oh , Jellie , Jellie , he was thinking , do n't say anything about your body . Give a poor man space to breathe , space to be less wicked than you already have made him in his impure thoughts . " Michael , any chance we might meet some-82 Robert James Waller  | where ? I 'd like to talk , but I do n't want to come to your office since I suspect Jimmy will be up at the university as soon as he comes to . " " Sure , anyplace . You name it . " " How about the bar at the Ramada out by the shopping center ? " " Fine . When ? " " What time is it now ? " He looked at his watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end for a few seconds . " Would eleven push you too hard ? I 'd like to be gone when Jimmy wakes up so I do n't have to think up some reason for going out . " " No , that 's fine . I have the Shadow tied down outside the building . Eleven , then ? " " Yes . . . Michael ? " " I 'm here . " Too cool , being way too cool . " I 'm looking forward to seeing you . " " Me too , Jellie . See you in twenty minutes . " It was only a ten-minute ride out to the Ramada , so he went down to the mailboxes , collected a pile of book advertisements and a very pleasant invitation from The Atlantic editor to send some more pieces . That got him thinking for a moment : maybe he could hack it as a free-lance writer . Not enough in that to keep him going , probably , but he could take early retirement , annuitize his retirement fund , and maybe pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his word processor . There was also a letter from the University of California Department of Economics inviting all of its Ph.D . alumni to a reception at the winter meetings in Las Vegas . The usual , Michael got it every year . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 83  | But he never went , even though he was grateful for the degree and sent them money when they asked for it . He pulled the Shadow out into traffic getting heavier as the students returned for the fall semester and rolled down Thirty-second Street , bumping into Route 81 about ten blocks farther on . The highway ran a winding route through one of the nicer sections of Cedar Bend , and he leaned the Shadow into the curves , noticing a slight valve tick needing attention . Jellie was already seated when he got there . It was dark in the lounge , and he could n't see her at first , partly because she was back in one of the corner booths off to his right . " Michael , over here . " Jellie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to him . Black hair gathered high , bighooped silver earrings , light yellow summer dress with sandals . Walking toward her , feeling clumsy , estranged from her . She held out her hand , Michael took it and slid in beside her . She kissed him on the cheek , then , butterfly-quick , leaned back and looked at him . He was gone again , over the hill just seeing her , hands sweating and heart valves ticking like the Black Shadow . " You 're all suntanned , Michael . You look great , just wonderful , and no preschool haircut yet . " " Nah , I 've been putting it off . I hate going to barbers , something to do with loss of manhood , maybe . More likely because , when I was about four years old , the only barber in Custer threatened to cut off my ears if I did n't sit still while he was working on me. 84 Robert James Waller  | She laughed . " Really ? Did that really happen ? " " Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brambles of anxiety after that . You look wonderful , too , Jellie . I 've thought about you a lot . " She looked down , then up at Michael , then down again . The bartender came around the bar and over to where they sat , lighted a small candle on the tabletop , and asked what she could get for them . Jellie ordered a club soda with lime . Michael asked for a St. Pauli Girl , which the bartender did n't have , so he settled on a Miller 's . While they waited for their drinks , Jellie asked him about his spring and summer . He told her about the two articles , and her eyes widened when he mentioned The Atlantic . " Hey , that 's the big time . Con-gratulations . " The bartender came back . Jellie insisted on paying the check , so he let her . Michael held up his beer , and she touched her glass to his . " What shall we drink to , Michael ? " " How about survival . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same . " Her chastisement was gentle . " How about we drink to a nice summer day and your success in writing . " " And to your safe return , " he said . " How 's the Shadow running ? " " Good , overall . It 's a perpetual battle , but good . I took it down into Tennessee this summer , but did n't stay long . The Smokies are a nightmare ; they 're thinking of limiting the number of tourists that can visit there . Then I rode it out to Custer and stayed a week with my mother . " " How is she ? " Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 85  | " Old , and getting more fragile every day . I 'm afraid we 're not more than two years away from a nursing home or something along those lines . " Jellie did n't say anything for a while . He drank his beer , she drank her club soda and lime . He took out his cigarettes and offered her one . She refused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to that , not sure what it is . " He nodded and flipped open the Zippo , lit his , and leaned back against the padded booth . She slid over farther so she could turn and look straight at him . Michael was tired of the dancing . " Where are we , Jellie , the two of us ? It 's been a long nine months for me . " After he said it he wished he 'd moved into this a little slower . Typical male fashion  --  no fore-play . She did n't say anything for a moment . He 'd forgotten just how gray her eyes were until she kept them on his for at least ten seconds . " I 've done a lot of thinking , Michael . " Those were bad-news words , he could tell . Something in the words themselves , something in the way she said them . What they felt for each other did n't require thinking . It required acting , not thinking . The happiness from seeing her again started draining down and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the words all ready to say , but it 's much harder than I thought it would be . I 'd convinced myself the way I felt about you was a kind of girlish infatuation with a different sort of man than I 'd ever encountered before , or at least not for a long time . But with you here looking 86 Robert James Waller  | at me with those good brown eyes , your hair drifting over your shirt collar and all , it 's more difficult .. . a lot more difficult . " " Say it , Jellie . I already know what 's coming . " " I suppose you do , and I 'm going to say what I have to say before I get to the point I ca n't say it . We 've got to cut this clean before real trouble starts . " He was prepared for it , but that did n't stop the harpoon from entering his chest and going out the other side . " Jimmy asked me several times in the days before we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said I was acting a little strange . It was you , Michael  --  no , us . I was thinking about us , fantasizing about things I do n't even want to mention . " " That 's all right , Jellie , I 've had the same kind of images in my mind since the day I first saw you . Mine would just blow you away if I started talking about them . " " Women have those thoughts , too . Let me go on . In ways you 'll never know , and I do n't want to talk about , I owe Jimmy a lot . Look , we both know Jimmy . He 's a little goofy in certain ways , but he 's very kind to me . " Jimmy was crushed when the best schools would n't accept him for his doctorate . His grades were good , but only because he worked so hard . God , his parents just hammered and hammered at him about the whole idea of success . But Jimmy does not have a truly fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , though it bothers him because of the world in which he 's chosen to earn a living , a world where he 's constantly reminded of his limitations just by being around people like you , Michael . "  | " Oh , hell , Jellie . . . " He started to do a foot shuffle into something resembling modesty , a little dance called the South Dakota backstep . But she 'd have none of it and interrupted him . " Michael Tillman , do n't play the country boy with me , please . It 's not becoming , and I know better . You scare Jimmy . He knows he 's not in your league . He could write all his life and never get an article accepted by the journals in which you 've published . I do n't mean to imply you do n't work hard , I know you do , in spite of the casual way you seem to operate . And Jimmy likes you . He likes you a lot , and he 's appreciative of the good ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll be responsible for it in good part . " " Jimmy 's all right , Jellie . He 's a lot different than me , but I respect him for the way he keeps his head down and the numbers crunching . I could n't do that . " He lit another Merit and took a drink of his beer . This was turning into something a little unpleasant , and he did n't want that to happen with Jellie . She was floating off , getting loyalty and Jimmy 's shortcomings and her own emotions all tangled up . Chewing on him in small ways as a means of protecting herself from her own feelings . " Jellie , let me try and say what I think you 're telling me . You feel good things for Jimmy , among them at least a kind of love , I 'm sure . You 're a loving person . And you feel a gratefulness toward him for something I do n't know about and wo n't ask about . Though I have a feeling India works into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to know , even though it would n't affect how I feel about 88 Robert James Waller  | you no matter what it is . And you want to make sure our feelings for each other do n't go any further than just that  --  feelings . Have I got it right ? " She nodded , tears in her eyes . He had momentum and kept rolling . " Here 's the bottom line , Jellie Markham Braden : I 'm in love with you , truly and powerfully in love . I guess I knew it when you walked in the dean 's kitchen a year ago in your blue suit and black boots , knew it when we sat on the back steps that day . Christ , teeter-totters in the park . Do you have any idea of how much I 've wanted you , all of you , everything that makes you up , tangible and otherwise ? The whole works , that 's what I want . As much as I can get in the years I have left , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how deeply I feel ? " " Michael . . . do n't . " She reached in her purse , took out a handkerchief , and put it against her eyes for a moment . The bartender was not insensitive ; she had a feel for what was going on and turned up the television to cover their conversation . Michael nodded at her in thanks , and she gave him a little wave . He put his hand on Jellie 's neck , the first time he 'd ever touched her in that way . Her skin felt exactly as he 'd known it would , and the sensation ran up his arm , went down somewhere inside of him , and made a low , sad sound for all the times he 'd never feel it again . " It 's okay , Jellie . We 'll make it work . We 'll put some bandages on the cuts and promise not to look under them ever again . I 'm not sure I can stay in the same town with you , but I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can eventually work it out so  | we can have coffee at Beano 's now and then . Maybe it 'll spiral down and we can do that . " She stuffed her hanky back in her purse and reached out for his left hand , holding it tight in both of hers . " You 're right , Michael , in everything you said . Damnit , I know why people get frustrated with you sometimes and are secretly afraid of you . Your mind is like a rifle bullet when you decide to let it run full tilt , and that 's scary . Carolyn , the dean 's wife , said that about you the first day I met you . She said , Michael Tillman frightens the hell out of Arthur , and Arthur retaliates in mean little ways . ' The dean was going to turn you down for full professor on those grounds alone , even though you 'd done twice as much work as it took to qualify . Carolyn told him , Arthur , you pull that piece of crap on Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Cedar Bend . ' " Now they had Carolyn and Arthur into it . Jellie kept wandering away from the subject , but he understood why . There was a door closing behind them , and she wanted to keep it open all the while she was pulling it shut . " Jellie , let 's let it rest where it is . You know where to find me . Come by if you feel you can . Hell , I just like to be around you , to look at you , to smell your perfume when I get close , which I have n't done nearly enough . " " I do n't think so . There 's something about being in each other 's presence that 's just too strong for me ? for both of us . I came off the plane clear-headed and ready to tell you exactly how I felt and what I was 90 Robert James Waller  | going to do , now here I am turning into mud pie . I 've got to get my life organized again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be on campus three days a week . If I feel okay about it , I 'll stop by to see you . If I do n't , and I probably wo n't , it 's not because I 'm not thinking about you . You understand that , do n't you ? " " Yes . I understand , Jellie . I do n't like it , but I understand . And I 'll be thinking about you , too . That 's all I ever seem to do anymore . " As they left the Ramada bar , Jellie pulled a small package from her purse and handed it to him . " I forgot to give you this . " He tore open the wrapping . Inside was a belt made of English bridle leather with Orville handtooled on the back . Michael took the Shadow out of town and let it go all the way to Des Moines , where he turned around and came back into Cedar Bend through one of those soft August twilights . Going home past the campus , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first football game . They were playing some old song from some old movie . Michael Tillman could n't remember the name of either the song or the movie , because he was thinking about Jellie Braden and wondering how he was going to get through the years ahead without her . The lights in Bingley Hall flickered on , and the race to December got under way . Jimmy Braden came by Michael 's office for new ideas , and the football team was doing well . On those Saturdays when the team was playing at home , the streets were packed Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 91  | with Cadillacs and Lincolns , driven by overweight men who wrote out large checks to the athletic department and whose daughters were in the best sororities . Michael paced the classroom , tossing a piece of chalk up and down in his right hand . " Consider , for a moment , the nature of systemic problems , the elements of a puzzling issue and the subtle , intricate relationships among those elements . What we must do is learn how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archimedean Dilemma . " He always hesitated at this point and looked out at the class . " Who , by the way , was Archimedes ? " They all focused on their notebooks , pretending to be doing something . He pushed and prodded , and finally a young man ( bad complexion , front row ) said hesitantly , " Was n't he some kind of scientist or something ? " Michael gave them a two-minute capsule on the life and times of the Greek mathematician . After that , he picked up the thread of the lecture again . " Archimedes said , Give me a lever and a place to stand , and I will move the world . ' That 's what structural modeling is all about , finding a lever , a place to stand , an angle of entry into complexity . " He paused , thinking of Jellie , while the students wrote in their notebooks and wondered if he would ask about Archimedes on the first examination . During the second week of school he was looking out the window while covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the quaver of now turning leaves in the wind of September , and saw her . At first it did n't register , since he was working hard at getting the students to appreciate the intellectual leavings of one George Boole , the nineteenth-92 Robert James Waller  | century mathematician who took formal logic up about fifty notches . But the long-legged walk and tweed cap finally got his attention Jellie . He stopped talking , he was n't sure how long , and watched her wind along a sidewalk , knapsack over her shoulder . Jellie from a distance , always from a distance . When she moved out of sight , he turned back to the class . They were all looking at him in a strange kind of way . His face , maybe , or his body . They saw something , in his eyes or the momentary sag of his shoulders , and they knew they had n't seen it before . Michael glanced at the wall clock . Five minutes to go . " That 'll be all for today , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , they filed out , some of them giving him sidelong glances and talking to one another . A young woman whispered , " Did you see how he looked ? What happened to him all of a sudden ? " Michael had n't realized how much it showed . Jellie was right in believing they had to stay apart . Aside from protecting themselves from each other , people would start to pick up on how they felt , even if they were merely in the same room together . He 'd been looking at advertisements for faculty positions in the Chronicle , but at his salary and rank it would be difficult to make a move . Besides , with his mother 's health declining , he felt a responsibility to stay in the middle of the country and not be too far from her . Still there might be something somewhere that met his requirements and took him away from the town where Jellie Braden lived . It 's hard to say where all this might have gone if it had n't been for the ducks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93  | place by a different route . The history of the situation is this : University presidents relish new buildings , so do Boards of Education . Bingley Hall was just fine ? old , but with a patina of learning and struggle rubbed into its corridors and heavy in its air . Still , the president decided one of his premier colleges needed a new building . Presidents do n't bequeath knowledge or grateful students to the world , they leave behind bricks and mortar . Whether those bricks and mortar are actually necessary is irrelevant . The important thing is to get money and build buildings carrying the names either of heavy donors to the university or members of the administration who served the university loyally , though not necessarily brilliantly . The Arthur J. Wilcox College of Business and Economics ? you could see the lettering in the dean 's rodentlike eyes as he scooted around Bingley Hall with rolledup blueprints clutched in his sweaty paws . Fat chance . The money could have been used for faculty salaries or student financial aid , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying , privately , of course , " It 's much easier to get money for buildings than it is for faculty salaries . " But , in spite of hard economic times in the state , the board floated a bond issue and ponied up $18 million for a new building . That had occurred the previous winter , and final construction plans were now being drawn . Arthur posted emerging versions of the plans in the coffee room for everyone to slobber over . Michael was standing there looking at an updated set and noticed the location of the new building had been moved fifty yards from its original site . " They 're going to put the sonuvabitch right over the duck pond , " he 94 Robert James Waller  | said to no one in particular . The other faculty members present looked at him in a way that said , " So what ? " Michael went to see Arthur and explained to him the rather neat and profound role the pond played in the traditions of the campus . It was n't much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet long by fifty feet wide . But it was home for little geezers with orange legs who looked at Michael when he walked by and went " Quack " when he grinned and said hello to them . It was also a place for moonlight walks and tender thoughts , a place where ten thousand engagement rings had been slipped over shaking fingers through the years , not to mention various other assignations getting a little more carnal late at night . When Michael looked out his office window , he could see the ducks on their pond a block away , and often he had found solace in that when dealing with education gone ber-serk . But guys like Arthur J. Wilcox have no appreciation for tradition , it 's not tangible enough . Michael talked hard , but it did n't register . Arthur just kept saying , " But , Michael , we need a new building . " " What about the ducks ? " Michael was angry . " Where will they go ? Are we going to build a new eighteen-million-dollar pond for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . You could see it on his face . That and the plain wish Michael would just go away and leave him alone with his blueprints . Michael was pretty sure he would n't have raised as much hell about the duck pond as he did if he Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 95  | had n't been half-crazed with sorting out his feelings in those days , trying to push Jellie far back and out of his mind and failing in that attempt . He worked his way up through the provost , who did n't understand ducks any better than Arthur . Stomping past Clarice 's desk on his way out of the provost 's office , he turned around , then talked with her for a moment . Next he made an appointment to see the president . Michael laid out his case : Move the building , keep the duck pond . The prez was smooth . Years of dealing with demented faculty and recalcitrant alumni who stapled their checkbooks shut when they saw him coming had provided him with a sheen and style worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your point of view ) slithering public relations man . " Professor Tillman , I do understand your concerns . Tradition is important , I agree with you . But in evolving times we must sometimes cast off our old traditions and establish new ones . I like ducks , too . In fact , I 'm a member of Ducks Unlimited and go duck hunting every fall . " Michael was wondering if , in addition to professional incompetence and moral degradation , presidential dismemberment was sufficient cause for loss of tenure . One of the best students Michael ever had went on to law school and stayed in Cedar Bend after grad-uating . Michael called him . " Gene , what can be done to prevent these clowns from pouring cement over ducks and tradition ? " Gene always had a soft spot for radical causes , so he looked into it . He called back in two days , flat out saying the building could n't be halted by legal 96 Robert James Waller  | chicanery . Something to do with state law and a Board of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Screw ' em , Gene . I 'm going to plant myself right in the middle of that pond and make ' em drag me out with chains . " " Michael , I 'll defend you free of charge if you do it . But you 're going to lose . You 'll be better off spending your time looking for another home for the ducks . " Knowing bureaucrats hate bad publicity more than anything else , Michael wrote a long article for the university newspaper , making what he thought was a powerful and eloquent plea to save the duck pond . That started a fair amount of debate over the whole affair , which drove Arthur dotty . Arthur went completely out of his mind when the longhairs from the Student Socialist Brigade made up signs reading " Save the Ducks " and began marching around Bingley Hall in their Birkenstocks . Recruiters from the Fortune 500 who were on campus interviewing savvy students told Arthur they were looking for good corporate citizens , not radicals . He took them over to the faculty club for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodic outbreaks coming down to us as a result of universities being too lenient in the sixties and it would soon be over . Afterward he took the recruiters to his office , unrolled his blueprints , and showed them all the wonderful space the new building would have for interview rooms . They liked that a lot better . The university newspaper was flooded for a few days with letters pro and con . One of the bookstores Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 97  | printed up T-shirts with the logo Ducks , Not Cement and sold them for twelve dollars each , proving once again capitalism can profit even from the concerns of its enemies . Michael was surprised to see Jellie write a letter to the newspaper in support of his position . It was a nice letter . And he knew it probably caused her trouble at home , since jimmy had dropped by to talk with him about the issue and seemed utterly amazed , or perhaps bewildered , that Michael could get so worked up over eight or ten ducks . But nobody except Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the earthmoving machinery was carted into position on the back of big , muddy trucks . Gambling on having a mild winter , the contractors would begin digging on the following Monday . Michael was sure the tame ducks would n't know how to handle the filling of their pond and contacted the Humane Society . He and the society put a notice in the paper saying anyone who wanted to help in getting the ducks moved should show up early Saturday morning and be prepared to get wet . Light frost lay upon the grass of autumn when Michael rode the Shadow through early light and parked it by the pond . While he sat on the bike , taking one last look at tradition and little geezers who slapslapped about on orange legs and flat feet , he noticed someone walking down the road toward the pond . Jellie . Jellie in the morning , Jellie at the duck pond . She wore old jeans and her hiking boots , a heavy sweater and a red stocking cap with Grownup printed on the front . Her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she walked toward him . 98 Robert James Waller  | " Hello , Michael . I came to help you find the ducks a new home . " He cared for her more at that moment than ever before . " Jellie . . . thanks for comng . It 's going to be something of a mess , I 'm afraid . But the little folks need somewhere to go . " She walked over to him , wrapped both her arms around one of his , and leaned against the Shadow , putting her head against his shoulder . The physical contact was unnerving and surprised him , but he thought , Maybe we 're going to work it out and be friends , nothing more . He only thought that for a moment . Being merely Jellie 's friend and nothing more was impossible for him . The Humane Society troops pulled in , a professor from the biology department riding along with them . He had cages and a net that could be fired out over the pond with small rockets , which took him about twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , Michael did n't say much , watching the professor and his helpers from the Humane Society , all of whom wore chest-high rubber waders . They strung the rocket net along the shore while the ducks woke up and swam around in circles , alarmed and telling everyone who would listen about how they felt . Jellie and Michael walked over near the water where the professor was crouched , making adjustments on his apparatus . He straightened up and said , " Ready . " Everyone stood back while he threw bread crumbs onto the water . Alarm is one thing , bread crumbs are something else , and the ducks swam toward them , quacking . When the ducks came within Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 99  | range the biologist fired his rockets , which scared hell out of the ducks . But the net arched across the pond , went down past the face of a rising sun and over ten frightened ducks . The biologist waded into the water , motioning for the Humane Society to follow him . They got around on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ducks toward shore . The professor obviously had done this before . He glanced up at Jellie and Michael . " We 'll hand you the ducks . You two can put them in the cages , very carefully , if you please . " So saying , he rolled up his sleeves and began reaching under the net , which now formed a small semicircle near the shore . It was all very crisp , easier than Michael had thought it would be . He and Jellie put the ducks in cages , Jellie petting them and talking in a low , sweet voice as she handled the terrified birds . The operation took less than ten minutes . The biologist rolled up his net while Michael and Jellie carried three cages to the Humane Society truck and put them in the back . A woman in a tan shirt with a Humane Society of the United States patch on it said , " We 're taking them out to Heron Lake north of town . You know where that is ? " Michael nodded . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jellie . " Want to come ? There 's room in the truck , or you can ride with me . " She turned to the woman from the Humane Society . " We 'll meet you out there . " At that moment , Michael felt as if some kind of decision beyond transportation had been made . He kicked the Shadow 's starter and helped Jellie climb on behind him . She 'd never been on a motorcy-100 Robert James Waller  | cle before , so he gave her a twenty-second lecture on where to rest her feet and how to lean with him in the curves . She wrapped her arms around his waist and said , " This is fun , Michael , " as he pulled out behind the truck . The campus was quiet early on a Saturday , air warming rapidly , prodded on by a fat , red sun . The Shadow rolled smoothly down the streets of Cedar Bend and out into the countryside through tunnels of red and yellow leaves . Jellie 's arms tightened around Michael . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could be far into Minnesota by evening if he just let the Shadow run on toward wherever the highway went . They swung into the state park entrance , still following the Humane Society truck and its little cargo . Through the park and on to Heron Lake , lying cool and flat on a windless morning . The ducks were shown the water and knew what to do with it , waddling out of their cages and paddling around , looking for food . The biologist said , " It 'll take them a while to adjust . With all the people at the university handing out grub , they 're not used to foraging on their own . But I 'll check on them every few days . Eventually they 'll get accustomed to life out here . Portions of the lake stay open during winter . " This was the way it was meant to be , Michael was thinking as they rode back into town . Jellie and he , and the Shadow , and bright autumn mornings with the road out in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Braden III , who probably had tickets for the football game that afternoon .  | He glanced at his watch  --  eight-fifteen  --  it was going to be a long day and a long life . Jellie was trying to say something , but Michael could n't hear her over the wind and sound of the engine . He eased off the Shadow , letting it slow down and coast , and tilted his head back toward her . She put her fingers on the side of his neck , speaking in a soft voice , right into his ear : " Michael , can we go to your apartment ? " He turned his head for an instant and looked into the gray eyes . She was half smiling , half not smiling . A strange , warm , loving look . He nodded and began to shake a little . She laid her cheek against his back and put her hand under his jacket and inside his shirt , moving it slowly back and forth over his chest and stomach . The Shadow took him toward home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years . And it took him and Jellie Braden toward a future he 'd long ago decided would never come . When they got off the Shadow at his apartment , smoke from burning leaves was drifting through the neighborhood . In the distance voices were singing the university fight song at a morning pep rally . He held the door for her and they went inside , into the world of a man who lived alone and stayed mostly to himself . Dishes in the sink , a pair of jeans on the floor , streaks on the windows . Small kitchen , large living room , bedroom off through another door . In a corner of the living room nearest the kitchen was a scarred maple table where he took his meals . The three chairs around the table were each of a different kind and Goodwill rough . Plain , ceramic 102 Robert James Waller  | salt and pepper shakers sat on the table next to a stack of paper napkins . Near the table and along the wall was his work area . His desk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanked the desk , with one long board running over the top of it , holding reference books . In the middle of the desk was a computer , turned on and with words typed across the screen , cursor blinking . The far end of the desk held a stack of audio equipment , tapes in desultory piles on and next to the equipment . Jellie took off her stocking cap and laid her coat over the back of a chair . As she looked around , it struck her that she knew very little about Michael Tillman . More than that , she 'd never been completely alone with him . " I think I need a drink , " she said . " Do you have anything with alcohol in it ? " " Beer , wine , and maybe " ? he opened a cupboard door and looked inside ? " a little whiskey . " He took out the whiskey bottle and held it up . It was a third full . Clarice sometimes preferred whiskey when the nights were long and wild and getting wilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ice with a little water " Jellie took a deep breath ? " should do it . " Michael stood for a moment , holding the whiskey bottle , looking at her . " You okay ? " " Yes . " She smiled and brushed loose strands of hair back from her face . " About eighty percent , at least . " " I could take you home if you want . " She shook her head , small silver earrings from Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 103  | her early days in India moving as she did it . " Let 's try the Jack Daniel 's first . " He owned four glasses . All of them were in the sink , dirty . He washed one and pulled an ice cube tray from the refrigerator . Jellie walked slowly past his desk , trailing her finger along the edge of it . Above the desk were notes and two snapshots . One of the pictures was her standing by a stone wall in Ireland . The other was a yellowed , curling , black-and-white shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearded man in a dark turtleneck sweater , jeans , and sandals . She stared at the second photo and recognized the eyes . " Is that you ? " He looked up from the counter where he was fixing her drink . " Yes . A long time ago in Berkeley . " He poured Jack Daniel 's and handed the glass to her . " The woman 's name was Nadia . She 's an implacable feminist now  --  was starting to become one then , in fact  --  works for the National Council of Women . We exchange notes at Christmas . " Jellie did n't say anything . She read the words typed on the computer screen : In this place I hear the quiet rasp of things as they used to be . I come at dawn , I come at nightfall , and all the hours in between . I come to hear the rustle of twilight robes and songs from the time of Gregory . I come because old things live here , things I understand without knowing why . " Is this something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointed at the screen . " Yeah , I keep fiddling around , thinking I might have a novel inside me . " He set the bottle of beer he was drinking on the counter . 104 Robert James Waller  | " Do you ? " " Maybe . It 's harder than I thought it would be . Writing the academic stuff and essays , you 're always bound to reality . So far I 'm having trouble dealing with the freedom to make up anything I want to say . It 's kind of strange  --  in fiction you get to tell lies and are applauded for it . " " Justifiable lies , " she said . " I suppose that happens sometimes in real life , too . " " If you 're a relativist it does . And maybe now and then if it 's absolutely necessary to cushion someone from a world gone too harsh and bitter . " In the far corner of the room was an easel folded and leaning against a window . " Do you paint ? " Jellie asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his jeans . " I try . I know a guy named Wayne Regenson over in the art department . He and his wife periodically fight like hell . When that happens he drops by for a little male support , which I 'm not very good at , but better than nothing , I suppose . In return he 's been trying to teach me oil painting . It 's coming real slow . Real , real slow . In some ways , though , it can be a lot like mathematics  --  true mathematics ? the same feelings in your brain . The elegance of saying much with little , bringing together left-brained technique and right-brained shapes . " " Like the long-range jumpshot , too ? " He thought for a moment . " Yes , that too . " " Is this one of yours ? " She was looking at an oil painting , framed and hanging on the wall . It was a group of black , vertical lines sprouting slashes of green and a ribbon of yellow winding away from the Slow Waltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical lines . Farther and farther the streak of yellow wound , disappearing then in a splash of red . " Yes , it 's the only one I can bear looking at . Actually I kind of like it . " " So do I. Does it have a title ? " " I call it Butterfly Gone . " Jellie tipped her glass and took a serious drink of Jack Daniel 's . She turned and looked at him , then out the window . In the hard , south light of November , he noticed for the first time the early lines of age coming to her face . " This seems very strange , Michael . All our talks , our resolutions about right and wrong . . . all of that . " The university band was marching down the street a block away , playing the fight song , " We will go undaunted , hear our cry , hear our cry . " Jellie Braden watched the dark curling leaves of late autumn stir and begin to tumble across the grass as a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she had looked that morning in Cedar Bend , staring outside at the things of autumn . Still looking out the window , she 'd reached up and taken the elastic band from her ponytail , shaking the thick black hair loose and long . She 'd looked over at him then , the gray eyes soft and no longer like an arrow in flight , saying , " I 'm a little shaky . It 's been a long time since . . . well , a long time . " " When are you expected home ? " " I have the day . Jimmy 's attending a reunion of his fraternity on campus . They 're all going to the game and out to dinner after that . All that arm punch-  | " I got potatoes , **51;28;TOOLONG . I also got onions and lotsa beer . " " We 're in fat city . You cook the sandwiches , I 'll handle potatoes . Deal ? " " Deal . Do we have to get dressed , though ? I love seeing you naked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what I hope ? will go on after we eat , that 'd be wasted effort . " She bounced off the bed . " On to the naked kitchen for naked lunch , then . Who said that , naked lunch ? I should know . William ... " " Burroughs . 01 ' wild and woolly William S. It 's the title of one of his books . " " Get out the bread and show me the potatoes , Captain America . I 'm starving , too . " Two weeks later she was gone . She 'd had surges of guilt about Jimmy . So had Michael . Jellie cried once , thinking of it . " How can I be so callous and yet not care I 'm being callous ? I want you so much nothing matters , not guilt or anything like that . " But something had gone wrong in her marriage . It had been there for a long while , and the semester in England had underscored it , brought it into hard , sharp relief . Michael asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were do-ing . She shook her head . " I keep thinking of the word inertia . Sometimes , I think people stay together because of inertia and not much else . I have the feeling Jimmy and I are riding a tired horse , but we just keep going on because we do n't know what else to do .  | Jimmy wants to be a university administrator , a dean or something , and I ca n't get very excited about that , about being a good little administrator 's wife . I told him I want to finish my master 's , go on for a Ph.D. , and find a teaching position . He only said it would be difficult for both of us to find jobs we want at the same university . We had a couple of bad arguments about that in England . " Michael let her talk , let her work through all of the complicated things she was feeling . In some ways , Jellie was a traditional woman . In other ways , she was the new and emancipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . All of that was difficult enough to sort out by itself , and now he 'd entered the situation and cluttered it up even more . Though , when Michael mentioned that , she was kind enough to say he was not part of the clutter . But he was . Jellie had to go to Syracuse for Thanksgiving . Her parents had come out to Cedar Bend last year , so it was her turn to visit them . Jimmy 's folks were coming up from Rhode Island . She and Michael spent the entire afternoon together the day before she left , and he picked up something a little different in her behavior , something that started to haunt him . " Anything the matter , Jellie ? " She looked at him lovingly . There was no question about how she felt , as far as he could tell . " No , not really . " He did n't push it , figuring it would pass . Michael fiddled around over the long Thanksgiving weekend , counting the hours until Jellie would return . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while looking at the Polaroid of Jellie standing by a stone wall in Ireland . The computer keyboard  | was dusty , and the Shadow needed work , but he could n't find any motivation to do anything except jog in the mornings and think about her . On Sunday evening the department head called and asked if Michael could cover Jimmy 's econometrics class the next day . Jimmy had been delayed in Syracuse , some kind of personal emergency was all the department head knew . Michael went crazy , paced the floor , pounded the walls , Malachi and Casserole watching him in a kind of wonder . Monday night and still no word . He got the Markhams ' phone number from information and dialed it . Eleanor Markham answered . Jesus , it would have to be Mother Markham . Michael used the pretense he was covering Jimmy 's class and wanted some idea of how long he might be away . Shallow , transparent , but then he was n't thinking very well . Mrs. Markham was cool , very cool  --  brittle , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cedar Bend . She had known something about Jellie and the motorcycle man a year ago . She knew a great deal more now , Michael had a hunch . She 'd said Jimmy was on his way back . She had n't used both their names or a plural pronoun , indicating both of them were returning . Michael was screaming inside and wanted to ask about Jellie , but he had the clear sensation Eleanor Markham had no interest in talking with him about anything . He hung up and went absolutely wild in his head . The phone rang fifteen minutes later . It was Jimmy . He was back and wanted to come over . Michael said , " Yes , come right away , no problem , come as soon Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 111  | as you want to , " obviously overplaying it , but Jimmy did n't have a feeling for that kind of stuff and missed it completely . He rapped on Michael 's door five minutes later . Michael knew there was serious business afoot , just by looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ askew . Not the Newport Jimmy Braden Michael had come to know . " Michael , something terrible has happened , and I do n't have anyone to talk to about it . I 'm close to falling apart . " The voice inside Michael 's head was shouting , " Jimmy Braden , you fey little bastard , what 's going on ? Where 's Jellie ? " It was screaming loud enough for Jimmy to hear , but he did n't because he was n't listening . Jimmy merely sat on a kitchen chair , put his head in his hands , and cried . Michael brought himself down  --  level , brother  --  get level , stay level , and ask the right questions . " Talk to me , Jimmy . What 's happened ? Does it have something to do with Jellie ? " He sobbed and moved his head up and down in the affirmative . Do n't panic , get the information , get to the bottom , omit the extraneous junk and side issues . " Where 's Jellie ? " Jimmy looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's gone to India . " " What ? " Michael nearly shouted . " India ? What the hell for ? What 's going on ? Get straight and talk to me , Jimmy . I ca n't be of any help unless you do that . Why 'd she go ? " " I do n't know . We did n't have a fight or any-112 Robert James Waller  | thing . Saturday morning Jellie just said she had some things to think about and was going to India . Christ , Michael , I begged her , groveled , said whatever it was could be worked out , but she would n't talk about it . She was n't mean or cold , none of that , just far away from all of us , thinking about something . It was an awful scene , an absolute hell . Her parents were screaming , my parents were screaming , I was stumbling all over the place , and Jellie was packing her suitcase . " " Okay , " Michael said . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went ? She once mentioned a place called Pondicherry , in the southeast . Is that where she went ? " " I do n't know . " Jimmy was sniffling again . Michael scrounged around for a box of tissues , could n't find any , went in the john and brought out a new roll of toilet paper . Jimmy ripped off a wad and worked on his eyes with it , his voice thick and wet , phlegm in his throat . He blew his nose and said , " I tried to find out where she went , but the airlines wo n't give out that information on passengers . India 's a huge place , so it 's hard to say where she is , but , yes , she spent time in Pondicherry when she was there before . " Jimmy did n't drink coffee or beer . Michael poured him a glass of orange juice , lit a cigarette , and went over to the Shadow , straddling it , arms folded . He looked up at the wall and saw the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea for Jimmy to see it displayed so prominently . When Jimmy went back to wiping his eyes , Michael took it Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 113  | down and slid it under some papers on the desk . Jimmy Braden sat bent over , elbows on his knees , at the same kitchen table where Michael had made love with his wife a week ago , scraping the salt and pepper shakers onto the floor as he laid her down . She was laughing then . " When did she leave , Jimmy ? What airline was she taking out of New York ? " " Saturday night . She left Saturday night . She took a flight out of Syracuse to Kennedy . Would n't even let me or anyone else go to the airport with her and would n't tell me what airline she was taking out of New York . " " Somehow none of this sounds like Jellie , " Michael said . Smiling , warm , caring Jellie . It did n't sound like her at all . " I know it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael . It seems so unlike her . " Or maybe it is n't , Michael thought . Maybe there are things about Jellie Braden none of us know , or at least that he and Jimmy did n't know . " Jimmy , I 'm going to ask you a question . You can choose whether or not to answer it . I do n't have to know , but I 've somehow gotten this sense Jellie does n't like to talk about her India days . Did something happen to her over there ? " Jimmy looked up . " Michael , I ca n't say anything about that . I 'd tell you if I could , but I just ca n't . I just ca n't . Please understand . " Michael appreciated him for feeling that way and sticking to it . It would have been easy at a time like this to spill out the whole story , but he did n't . Michael 114 Robert James Waller  | decided Jimmy Braden might be a better man than he 'd given him credit for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think whatever happened to her in India had anything to do with her going back there now ? " " I do n't know . I ca n't imagine why , if she 's told me the truth about her time in India . Like I said , I ca n't talk about it , but I guess I can say what occurred in India was over a long time ago , or at least I thought it was . " Michael needed time to think , be by himself and start working out the options . Yet he did n't want to let Jimmy go home alone in this condition . " Jimmy , want me to arrange for someone to take your classes for a while , until you get yourself together again ? " " No , I need to be doing something . I 've never been good at just sitting around and thinking , at introspection . I 've got to get myself squared away somehow , and maybe getting back to school will help . Jellie just needs time to think , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an amount greater than he 'd raised it a moment ago . Jesus Christ , he thought , do n't put up with this shit , man . Screw the university . Get on the first plane to India and start looking for your wife . Talk to her , try to sort it out . That was not the way of Jimmy Braden , though . He was going to lie back and take it , and hope . But Jimmy Braden had never changed the oil in a banker 's car when summer was high and the wind from the western lands was hot and made your greasy Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 115  | clothes stick to your body . He 'd never stuck his head under the hood of an automobile and listened to the turn of an engine while his father staggered around with a flask in his pocket and yelled at him . And Jimmy Braden had never cut hard to the right and gone into the air with his knee swollen and twelve thousand crazed assholes screaming for and against him . Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry him along . He 'd never ridden in steerage , which made him inert when assertiveness was required  --  if there 's no need to climb , then there 's no reason to learn how to climb . That was Jimmy 's way , and Michael understood it . But it was n't Michael 's way . And , at that moment , he felt something deep and sad for Jimmy Braden . Inside of Jimmy , someplace , there had to be the old push from our times forty thousand years back , out on the grasslands , when the choice was either to fight for what was yours or have it taken by the malevolence around you . Civilization has its benefits , but it had robbed Jimmy and others like him of the basic instincts . When things stabilized and Michael was reasonably sure the husband of Jellie Braden could make it through the night , he got him into his Buick and on the road . Jimmy said just talking about getting back to his work made him feel better , that at least he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . He also blurted out a curious statement , saying he believed how he felt was mostly a matter of pride .  | Some of the old ways from the grasslands evidently were still there , but he could n't take the next step . Before Jimmy 's car turned the corner , Michael was looking in the Yellow Pages for airline telephone numbers .  | If you want to get to India fast , you deal with Air India . It 's the national airline and a good one . Every night at eight-thirty flight 102 lifts off from Kennedy and makes a two-hour stop in London the next day . Afterward it heads nonstop for either Delhi or Bombay , alternating between the two cities , depending on the day . There are other options , some of them convoluted . Aeroflot can get you to Delhi , but you have to put up with a long layover in Moscow . Before it collapsed , Pan Am went to Delhi twice a week from New York via Frankfurt . Those were the major eastern routes , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . The western routes can get even more circuitous  --  several different airlines and overnight layovers in Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur or Singapore .  | After checking his atlas to make sure he knew where Pondicherry was located , Michael called Air India . It was booked solid for the next fourteen nights , with two seats available on December 11 and one on December 13 , then solid again until after Christmas . Given the number of expatriates and former citizens out in the world , India has relatively sparse international air service , but the Indians all go home around Christmastime , and things get very tight from Thanksgiving forward . He rummaged his bookshelves until he found a world airline guide three years out of date . British Airways showed a nonstop from Chicago to London and then a later flight straight out to Madras on the east coast . Pondicherry was about 150 kilometers south of Madras , on the Bay of Bengal . Michael was n't worried about that leg ; if he could make Madras , he could make Pondicherry . All he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India has the best rail service in the world , in terms of number of trains going here and there . If not a train , then a bus . If not a bus , then a car and driver . If none of the above , he 'd walk . It did n't matter . What mattered was Jellie Braden somewhere in the swirling crowds of India . If she was n't in Pondicherry , he 'd be in tough shape . She 'd be almost impossible to track down if she decided just to lose herself out there . But , by God , he was going to try . He called the British Airways 800 number . Yes , said the quite lovely , very British , very female voice at the reservations desk , that flight was still operating , but there were no openings for the next three weeks . Did Mr. Tillman want to be put on a waiting list ?  | Yes . He called Air India again and also had them put him on a waiting list , with the date open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . His mother first . He called her , and they talked for a long while . He 'd never missed spending Christmas with her in the last twenty years but told her he had to go to India right away and did n't know when he 'd be back . Her ears were failing her , but she heard something in the way he spoke , urgency , intensity . " Michael , do n't tell me you 've finally found a special lady for yourself ? I 've never heard your voice sound quite like it does now . Is that it ? " " Mom , the answer is maybe . That 's all I can say . It 's just real important I do this thing  --  go to India ? but I hate to miss Christmas with you , if it comes to that . " " Michael , thank you for caring and for asking . I 'm glad we 've gotten to be with each other as much as we have over the years . Go to India and find this lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can meet her . I still have n't given up hope on having grandchildren , you know . " " Mom , I promise I 'll come out to Custer as soon as I 'm back , though I 'm not sure when that will be . " " Fly on , Michael . If this is your moment , take it . Stop talking to me and get to India . " The departmental secretary was a first-rate person who knew the systems and ways to get around them . Michael always gave her a bottle of wine at Christmas and sent her flowers at the end of the academic year . She agreed to fill out his final grade sheets and forge his signature on them . She did n't even ask 120 Robert James Waller  | why . He asked her not to say anything , and she said , " Do n't worry , you and I understand each other . Wherever you 're going in such a hurry and whatever you 're going to do when you get there , I 'd like to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strange little knowing smile . Jimmy Braden had come back on Monday night . On Tuesday Michael announced to his classes they were shutting down that day . Since he would n't be giving a final examination , he told them everyone got one-half a grade higher than what the scores in his grade book currently showed . To hell with it , once in a while you 're entitled to be flaky . Hats flew in the air , and a young woman 's voice came from far back in the classroom : " We love you , Professor Tillman . Merry Christmas . " He gave one of the MBA students who lived upstairs in his building a hundred bucks to make sure Malachi and Casserole were well cared for . Travel light . Real light . He 'd booked a flight to New York , but no reservations beyond , and he might get hung up anywhere on his way to India . New York , Moscow or London , Cairo or Athens . Anywhere . It might take him a week or more to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray and mope all he wanted . Jimmy had already told his story to at least five other people , so he was getting lots of sympathy . But Michael was going to India to find Jellie , and he was going now . There was a reason she pulled out , and he had a pretty strong feeling it had something to do with him . Maybe not , but that 's how he guessed it . People get lost in India . That 's why a lot of them Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 121  | go there . He had to find Jellie before she just drifted off and , for whatever reason , retreated to a mountain commune or ashram in the boondocks where he 'd never find her . Old L.L. Bean knapsack . Three shirts , only one of them clean . Wear the clean one , blue denim . Jeans , one pair on the body and another pair in the bag , and some khakis . Wear bush jacket en route . Navy blue cotton sweater . Shoes ? Wear the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy clothes in India if he needed them ; the khurtas and some pajamalike bottoms underneath worked just fine for him . Other essentials , including a good map of the India subcontinent he 'd purchased on his last visit , showing railroad and domestic air routes . Small flashlight , old cotton hat with the wide brim . Damn , no malaria pills . Take the risk . No , have physician call the drugstore , pick them up on the way to the airport , even though he should have started taking them a week ago . Working hard , throwing clothes around the bedroom , folding shirts , rolling up the jeans and khakis with underwear and socks inside the roll , Malachi and Casserole watching . Jam the old pair of sandals in the top , cinch it up . The knapsack bulged . He hefted it  --  not too bad . Anything else ? Small canteen . It can be a long time between drinkable water supplies in India . The taxi came at eight A.M. on Thursday morning , sixty hours after Jimmy had sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was bizarre all right . Jimmy Braden was lurching around Bingley Hall telling people , in so many words , about how 122 Robert James Waller  | poorly Jellie had treated him , running off that way . And Michael was on his way to find her , but Jimmy did n't know that . A stop at the pharmacist 's , another at the bank . Three thousand in American Express Cheques , $100 units . Five hundred in cash . At the local airport , waiting for the commuter jet to Chicago , Michael remembered a detail he had n't taken care of and called the departmental secretary . After he cleaned up the detail , she said , " Michael , a cable for you just came in , hand-delivered . " He thought for a moment . This was dicey if it was from Jellie , which he had a feeling it might be . " Betty , read it to me , and I 'm swearing you to secrecy ever after concerning the contents . Deal ? " " If I told everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implode in the world 's largest cloud of dust . Besides , I have some vague sense of what 's going on . I 've seen your face change in the last few months . I saw you on your motorcycle out near Heron Lake early one morning not long ago , and I also saw who was riding behind you . But I 've never said anything , and I wo n't . Now , I put that together with the weeping going on in Jimmy Braden 's office  --  all over the building , for that matter  --  and it does n't require a mathematical genius like you to make it add up . " " Betty , Betty , Betty . . . you may end up being one of the great loves of my life . Read me the cable . " " Okay , I 'm opening the envelope . It says thirteen hundred hours . Let 's see , that 's ... " " That 's one in the afternoon , Betty . What 's the date ? " " It 's today 's date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedar Bend 123  | " Time difference . It was sent about one-thirty A. M. this morning , our time . What 's it say ? " " It says , M , Please try to understand . There are feelings so strong within me I need space and time to work them out . I 'll be in touch sometime , I promise I will . J. ' " The hell with space and time , that 's what Michael Tillman thought . Sometimes you let circumstances go their own direction , in the way Jimmy was doing , but sometimes you have to get in the middle of situations and manage them . He had a feeling Jellie was pretty confused , and he was n't going to let her just wander off in a fog . If he screwed up her life by going to India to look for her , she 'd have to live with it , and so would he . But he was n't about to sit on his duff in 1 Cedar Bend and hope for better days . " Betty , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madras . Did I pronounce it right ? " " No , but that 's okay . Everybody in the States gets it wrong . Betty , run the cable through your shredder , please . " " I will . Do n't worry . And , Michael ? ... " " Yes ? " " I 'll be back here cheering for you . Go find her . " " Thanks , Betty . Do you prefer necklaces or bracelets ? " " You know that 's not necessary . But I 'd like a bracelet sometime from some exotic place , if you insist . " " Done . Good-bye , and thanks again . My plane is boarding . " " ' Bye , Michael . Good luck . " 124 Robert James Waller  | At O'Hare he called Air India and had British Airways check to see if anything had opened up . Nothing . " What if I go down to the gate and see if there 's a no-show ? " he asked the woman running the British Airways counter . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your flight for New York leaves before ours departs for London . If you wait for us , you 'll miss your New York flight . " " I 'll chance it . I 'm feeling lucky , somehow . " She shrugged and typed his name into the computer as a standby . " We 're in the new United terminal , at the far end . Good luck . " He bought cigarettes and coffee , then went to the United terminal . An hour and fifteen minutes until British Airways 42 would leave for London . The passengers were lined up , long line winding back and along the terminal wall . Baggage . . . he never could understand why people carry so much . Huge suitcases tied with ropes . Christmas presents , bedrolls , tired kids with winter colds and runny noses tugging on their parents ' hands , crying . The line moved slowly . Twenty-five minutes before departure . Then twenty . Only two people left to check in . " Michael Tillman , Mr. Michael Tillman , please come to the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Tillman , we have a seat for you on the London flight departing in approximately fifteen minutes . However , we are not able to confirm a seat for you on flight 34 to Madras . Do you still want to go with us tonight ? " Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 125  | " Yes . I 'll pay for the ticket with my Amex card . " Six hours later he was looking at Ireland down below in first light , and he thought of Jellie standing along a stone wall somewhere down there , having a Polaroid picture taken , which eventually hung on a wall in Iowa . Except the picture was now in the pocket of his bush jacket . If you 're going to be a tracer of lost persons , a photo might be useful . He 'd thought of that at the last moment and brought the photo with him . Heathrow was chaotic , as usual . Michael passed up the transit lounge and went out into the main terminal , where he could look in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , people often book more than one flight under different names , and several cancellations had come in during the night . " Do you wish to book a return flight from India , Mr. Tillman ? " He told her to put him down for January 12 , a few days before the spring semester started . Indian officials strongly prefer you have a return ticket before a visa is issued . That 's a precaution flowing partly from the old hippie days when Western kids went seeking truth and enlightenment and ended up being dope-smoking , social welfare problems for the Indian government . Michael pulled out his Amex card , got the ticket , and located the tube into London . He told an official he needed a visa to India and was steered in the right direction . Three hours later he was back at Heathrow , through security , and sitting in the transit lounge . Five hours before his flight to Madras .  | Time always moved pretty fast for Michael in big airports . He liked to watch people come and go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the restroom and washing his face , he bought a copy of the London Times , settled down on a chair , and put his feet on the knapsack . But he could n't concentrate on the paper and fished the picture of Jellie out of his pocket . He sat there looking at it while the public address system summoned people to planes leaving for distant places . And somewhere out in those great spaces was a woman named Jellie Braden . She was out there , somewhere ... somewhere .  | In spite of his smart-lip comment to Jellie one time , Michael Tillman was not jaded . Maybe a little cynical , probably more than he had a right to be , but not jaded . Never had been . That 's an advantage coming down from the kind of childhood he spent . You grow up not expecting too much , so when good things happen in your life you 're amazed they happened at all . Long-haul travel was that way for Michael . When the pilot came on the intercom and said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and saw a brown city in the desert forty thousand feet below . He 'd done that before on his first trip to India , thinking , Baghdad  --  I never thought I 'd be flying over Baghdad . And he reached back like a mule skinner with a whip , pulling the memories forward , seeing himself working on the Shadow in his father 's 128 Robert James Waller  | gas station thirty years before . Working on it and looking out at the highway and knowing the Vincent Black Shadow could take him down that road if he learned all there was to know about valves and turning wheels and highways running eastward . When the plane was two hours out of Madras , Michael took his shaving kit out of the knapsack and went to one of the tiny restrooms . This kind of travel leaves a film on the body and mind , and he 'd developed the custom of shaving and cleaning up before landing . Somehow that also cleaned up the mind a little . The cabin was still dark , most people sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flight attendants were talking quietly with one another in the midplane kitchen . He stuck his head in and asked for a cup of tea . They fixed him up , and he went back to his seat , steaming cup in hand , in good shape overall but with the special , taut feeling in his stomach he always got when approaching a distant place , particularly India . He lifted the window shade and looked out . India coming up below , like a woman sprawled in the sun . Daylight , rugged brown hills , green splotches of jungle . The cabin lights came on , breakfast was announced . He did n't feel like eating much but puttered around with fruit and toast , knowing it might be a while before he ate again . The plane came down over the jumbled spread of Madras , port city on the Bay of Bengal . Estimated population over four million . India treats such numbers casually , however , since the cities have a constant flow in and out , mostly in , of a wandering people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the move , that 's the dominant impression Michael always had . Look anywhere in the countryside or in the cities , and there are people walking , riding bicycles , hanging off roaring buses or leaning out of train windows . Moving . . . moving . . . India . He walked in from the plane past men holding military rifles . Long line at the desk for those with foreign passports . Michael settled himself . You do n't hurry India . India has its own style , its own pace , and high-strung Westerners who demand all tasks be carried out with speed and crisp efficiency do n't do very well there . Warm and humid , and Michael was glad to be traveling light . The brown face above a dark green uniform looked at his passport , checked the ninety-day visa , and pounded the stamp . Customs was no problem since Michael was n't carrying anything of value except cash and traveler 's checks . But he was bringing in more than $1,000 U.S. , and a form was required . India loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these forms eventually found a home . It was hard to believe that a currency official somewhere actually paid attention to the millions of handwritten documents gushing from the pens of travelers : " Hmmm , I see that Michael Tillman from Cedar Bend , USA , brought thirty-five hundred dollars with him on 2 December . We 'll need to keep track of him in this country with nearly one billion people and a telephone system that , at best , wobbles along . " Outside the protection of a large Indian airport , no rules applied . Touts , hundreds of them , pushing whatever could be imagined . Maybe a few rupees could be bilked from the tall white guy with the knap-130 Robert James Waller  | sack . Except he looked a little roadwise , no luggage , looked like a hard traveler . It would be better to move on to someone with a little more fat . Thousands of people were milling around , coming and going , many of them simply hung on for the entertainment value provided by a major airport . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pressed their faces against dusty glass and waited for passengers to exit . A tourist desk in the lobby was actually open for business , which was a new twist . India was apparently working harder at getting gringos to come and leave some foreign exchange on their way through . On Michael 's earlier visits , he had the clear sense nobody cared whether you came or did n't , whether you died in the customs line or went home . The man at the desk spoke understandable English . Michael said he wanted to go to Pondicherry . The man told him it was a three-hour ride by car if the traffic was heavy and would be happy to arrange a car and driver for Michael . He quoted a price of $30 U.S. That sounded steep for India , and Michael said as much . " Oooh , but you see , it is a six-hour round trip for the driver , since he must go to Pondicherry and come back empty . So you must pay for both ways . " Michael knew better . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fare back to Madras . How about the guys outside with their cabs ? " Oooh , yes , sir , they will say they will take you for quite a lower price . But , sir , they are not quite reliable and may just take your money on the way ,  | leaving you stranded . " Michael knew the man was speaking with some accuracy . How about buses ? Trains ? The tourist official rambled on , running his finger up and down grimy , complicated schedules , and Michael started thinking , C'm on , Tillman . For chrissake , what are you doing ? You 're here in a panic to find Jellie Braden , and you 're standing around haggling over a few bucks . For a moment , the spurious masculine pride in cutting the sharp deal , which seemed to lie throbbing in the hormones until called upon , had caused him to lose his way . As it usually did . The official arranged a car and driver , telling Michael to wait by the tourist desk . Michael asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps , anything at all . The man produced a torn little magazine from under the counter , which he claimed was his only copy ( Michael believed him ) and started looking through it . A lecture on Pondicherry followed concerning the famous ashram founded there by a **31;81;TOOLONG named Sri Aurobindo , about hotels and restaurants and the beauty of the seawall . Was there a city map in the booklet ? Yes , there was one , indeed , sir , a very nice map . Michael laid a five-dollar bill on the counter , keeping most of it covered with his hand , and said he 'd very much like to take the Pondicherry guide with him . It was Mi-chael 's in less than a second , and his driver in a smudged white outfit came up to the counter , smil-ing . Outside , the sun was a hammer . Other taxi drivers swung open their doors and said they would take  | Michael to wherever he was going for half of what the fellow in the smudged white uniform was charging . Michael said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that they stopped smiling and were not his friends anymore . As Michael 's car pulled away from the airport , the driver began rubbing his thumb and forefinger together in the universal symbol for legal tender and pointed at his gas gauge , all the while saying , " Pet-rol . " Indian taxi drivers were always running on empty , and he needed an advance . On Michael 's last trip , two drivers had run out of gas while he was riding with them . Impatient , Michael tapped his foot while the tank was being filled . He noticed a fruit stand nearby and bought three bananas and two oranges , which he stuffed into the side pockets of his knapsack . Back in the car he waited for the driver . A ragged man bent down and looked in the window , displaying the grisly stump of an arm severed just above the elbow . Michael gave him five rupees . The man touched his forehead and backed away . Finally they were rolling through the noise and smoke and dust that was India and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting to the thick odors  --  smoke from factories and open cooking fires , leaded gas , excrement from humans and animals , all of it mixed together and forming the dense and penetrating smell defining India . He never completely lost that smell . Michael noticed when he watched a travelogue on India back in Cedar Bend , his brain immediately pulled up those old India smells from wherever Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 133  | the memories of smells are stored . No other country had drilled its odors into him in the way India had . The women . He 'd temporarily forgotten how beautiful were the Indian women , even the poorest ones . It was easy to fall in transient love every few seconds in India . A superb gene pool , male and female alike , maybe the best gene pool in the world when it came to physical appearance . Orange saris and green saris , red ones and blue ones , and gold upon their bodies , bracelets on their arms and combs in their hair . The women were lithe and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gold or silver chains running from nose to ear . He watched them as the driver constantly honked at goats and cattle and people , weaving through traffic , waved on by cops standing on small pedestals at the busier intersections . Into the countryside on a two-lane , severely bruised blacktop . Ashok and Tata trucks with workmen riding on top , their headwraps blowing in the wind . Buses careening around the curves , bullock carts in front of them , an old woman pedaling a wheelchair contraption in the other lane , people walking , herds of goats crossing . The driver turned up his radio , giving him and Michael the sound of a flute and drummers playing complex rhythms on tablas beneath it . He pounded the horn and made the occult Indian hand signals telling other drivers what his intentions were . India : moving . . . moving . . . tablas and flutes and dust , the road in front looking like a ragtag caravan put together with all the travelers and vehicles from the last five hundred years . 134 Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . The driver took it and gave Michael a flash of perfect white teeth , leaned on his horn , and peeled the banana , hot air roaring in through the open windows . They entered a town , and Michael unfolded his map of India . Must be Chengalpattu . They 'd be going slightly southwest to Madurantakam and then would make a southeast turn at Tindivanam , where a small blue line ran over to Pondicherry on the Bay of Bengal . Michael thumbed the five-dollar Pondicherry guide , looking at confusing street maps , reading the town 's history . It was a union territory , a city-state much like Washington , D.C. The state of Tamil Nadu on its west , the bay on its east . Settled by French traders in the seventeenth century , returned to India in 1954 . Jellie , are you there along the streets of Pondicherry ? On the off chance she had ridden with this same driver to Pondicherry , if she had gone to Pondicherry at all , Michael took out her picture and handed it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and grinned , shouting over the wind and flute music , " Pretty lady . You go see her in Pondy ? " Michael worked back down into pidgin English . " Lady ride this car ? " He pointed at Jellie in the photo , then at the driver and the interior of the car . Michael said it again : " Pretty lady ride this car ? " It took the driver a second , but he got the meaning and shook his head . " No , no see lady . " Michael nodded and put the photo back in his bush jacket . The guide said Pondicherry had a population of 150,000 , but Michael knew that was probably a best guess , far under the true count . Where to start ? Like Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 135  | all Indian cities , he figured it would be a maze of little streets and complex buildings tied in with one another via walkways and alleys . Even if she was in Pondy , it was not going to be easy . The ashram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and his consort , a French woman known only as " the Mother . " Both of them were dead . But , according to the guide , the ashram flourished . A visionary settlement called Auroville , also known as the City of Dawn , supposedly fashioned around the teachings of Aurobindo and the Mother , had been developing for over a decade just outside of Pondicherry . The guide quoted Mother : " Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual Human Unity . " That sounded like Jellie . Anthropologists , many of them , at least , had a strong inclination toward matters of the spirit , something to do with their trade . If Jellie was running and seeking spiritual guidance , the ashram and Auroville might be a good place to start . He 'd need a place to stay and looked at advertisements in the guide as the driver swerved and honked and signaled . Ajantha Guest House  --  An Oasis of Luxury Hotel Aristo  --  A Touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a Whole New World To the Western eye and ear , Indians had a penchant for overstatement , not to mention hyperbole ,  | and Michael discounted heavily what he read . Not that he was fussy . He 'd stayed many nights in small Indian hotels where a hole in the floor worked as a toilet and the shower was cold , if there was a shower at all . After a few nights , however , he 'd forget there was any other way than cold showers and a hole in the floor , and it all worked just fine . A hot shower , in traditional south Indian terms , would justify the claim " Truly an Aristocratic Experience . " He concentrated on Jellie , thinking hard about her ways and what he knew of her preferences . Where would she stay ? The Park Guest House was part of the ashram and had a Spartan attitude toward smoking , liquor , and human weaknesses in general . Jellie had come to think things over , according to her cable , and the guest house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to that way of life . Initially Michael thought that finding Jellie , if she was in Pondicherry , would not be all that difficult . White skin stood out in most of India . But it was a much larger town than he 'd anticipated , and the guide stated many Westerners came to bathe in the rarefied spirit of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother . And , as Michael had already considered , it was easy to get lost in India if that 's what you wanted . India could present a silent , impenetrable face when it chose , leaving you on the outside with no view to the interiors . Jellie was an old India hand , apparently with good connections , and would know how to conceal herself if she made up her mind to do that . If you were in a hurry , India could be infuriating . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 137  | The driver decided lunch was in order at Madurantakam . He pulled over and went up to an outdoor food stand . Michael was n't hungry but drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd bought in Heathrow . People gathered around him at a respectful distance and stared ; routine curiosity , nothing more . The sun was high and hard at noon . He clumped the old cotton hat on his head , fending off the kids who were less circumspect than their elders and wanted something , anything , from him . He bought some more oranges and handed them around , though the kids would have preferred something more wondrous , such as a cheap ballpoint pen from America . Sweat soaked through his shirt , ran down his chest and back . Michael was wiping his face and neck with a red bandanna when the driver signaled it was time to leave . Forty-five minutes later they made the turn at Tindivanam and headed southeast toward Pondicherry , running along a rough surface in worse shape than the road they 'd just left . This was semiarid land , palm trees arching over the road . People were spreading stalks of grain on the pavement , drying the grain , and letting vehicle wheels act as kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened in the back of the city guide indicated they were coming in on Jawaharlal Nehru Street , apparently one of the main thoroughfares . Michael decided against staying at the ashram 's guest house , mostly because he was n't sure how Jellie might feel if he suddenly showed up . If she saw him before he saw her , she might retreat  | with whatever secrets she carried and become impossible to find once she knew he was here looking for her . The Grand Hotel d'Europe at Number 12 Rue Suffren was in the same general area as most of the ashram 's workshops and not far from the guest house . It was run by an old Frenchman , a Monsieur Maigrit , according to the guide . Michael suspected the food would be continental , which suited him fine , since he tended to burn down pretty fast on a straight Indian diet . Michael motioned for the driver to pull over and showed him the map . The driver had trouble reading it , started talking rapidly , pointing ahead . Michael let him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where two hundred bicycles waited for a green light . The driver got out with the map and talked to several men standing in front of a tea shop . Arms waved , heads shook , hands pointed . All of this went on for a minute or two before the driver returned . He said something Michael did n't understand , zigzagging his hand , which Michael took to mean they should work their way through the city and then turn right . That seemed to fit , based on the map . They plowed up the busy main drag of Pondy and eventually hit a dead end at Rue St. Louis . The driver got out , went through the arms-head-hand language again , and came back to the car . A right turn , then skirting a large park on whose benches sat both Indians and aging French Legionnaires by the looks of their caps . A few blocks farther on another right , then a left . Painted on a building were the words Rue Suffren . Number 12 came up a half block later . Slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high wooden gate . An old Indian man in tan shorts and a white headwrap peeked out . Michael said , " Room ? " The gatekeeper glanced at the car and driver , then back at the tall American with wrinkled clothes and no luggage except a knapsack . Almost reluctantly he swung the gate open and indicated Michael should come into the courtyard . It was an old building , covered with vines and bougainvillea . Maigrit , Michael assumed it was him , came out of a doorway . Michael bowed slightly . " Do you have a room for a tired traveler ? " Maigrit looked at him , said nothing . Michael had arrived without prior reservations , which was probably considered a serious breach of decorum . Michael did n't speak much French , having forgotten most of what he 'd learned as part of his Ph.D . language requirement . But he smiled the good midwestern smile that seemed to get him by in most of the world and gave it a try : " Je voudrais une chambre ? " Maigrit smiled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a room was available for 150 rupees , about 9 dollars a night . Michael figured with advance reservations and a little haggling he could have knocked it down about a third or maybe half , but he was tired , and the location suited him . Maigrit informed him the daily afternoon water shutoff was in progress , so a bath was not possible , but the boy , who was about seventy-five , would bring a small bucket of water if Monsieur Tillman wanted to wash up . Michael thanked him and said that would be appreciated . And was laundry service available ? Shirts could be washed , ironed , and returned in four  | hours for double the normal price . The regular price was six cents a shirt . The boy delivered water , took the shirts , and Michael washed his face , then lay down on the bed and thought . Home was forty-six hours behind , though his internal abacus lied and said it was longer , years maybe . A week ago he 'd been sitting in his apartment waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay naked on his kitchen table while he rubbed red wine over her breasts . " Jellie , are you somewhere on the other side of these walls , close by , living out what you never want me to know ? "  | Michael awakened a little before six when the old man rapped on his door . He 'd slept for nearly four hours and got up feeling hot and stiff and road weary . He opened the door , took the shirts , and gave the man a tip . The old man bowed and left , looking back at Michael over his shoulder . Michael checked the faucets . The water had come back on , and he was a little surprised when the left tap gave him a warm stream . He ran a small tub , shaved , and got himself presentable with a clean body , clean shirt , and fresh pair of Levi 's . The proprietor was on the veranda , reading a French newspaper . What Michael needed first was flexible transportation , a motorcycle . He 'd seen a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , a small motorcycle could be 142 Robert James Waller  | rented at a location on Mahatma Gandhi Road . Maigrit had the gatekeeper call a bicycle rickshaw for Michael and spoke in Tamil to the rickshaw man , giving him the address . Maigrit said the ride would cost a quarter , and a dime tip would be about right . Michael watched the bulging leg muscles of the man pedaling him through the streets of Pondicherry . Unlike some Westerners who had never traveled in these places and frowned on the use of rickshaws as something next to slavery , Michael did n't see it that way . If you asked the rickshaw man how he felt about it , he would n't understand the question . It was how he made his living , and he was quite happy to deliver you somewhere for a fee . It was called participating in the local economy . As Michael once told a colleague who disdained such colonialist behavior , " Pay the rickshaw man New York cab fare , maybe it will make you feel more politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of muscle power with differences in the degree of it used . India was , in many ways , an evening country . The heat and dust settled down late in the day , and the streets were crowded . Merchants stayed open late . Time then for long , leisurely dinners and laughter in the cafes , commencing around nightfall . The rickshaw man turned left on Sastry Street , pedaling a straight line toward MG Road . Michael sat there feeling exposed , not wanting Jellie to see him coasting along through the streets of Pondicherry . Christ , he thought , how strange this is . Here I am looking for a woman with whom I 've made love , a woman who rolls in pleasure beneath my touch and says over and over again how much she loves me.  | Yet I 'm worried about her seeing me . It 's a curious world , Michael Tillman . That 's what he said to himself as the rickshaw bumped along through the south India twilight . The motorcycle rental outfit was located in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere and parts scattered about . Michael felt at home . Two machines leaned against the door , two more were torn down inside . Michael could have either of the two by the door . He looked them over . They were rough as the roads they traveled and pretty well banged up . The old Kawasaki looked like it might run , and after a few kicks he had it going . The proprietor stood watching him , hands on hips , not smiling . Michael pointed to tools on the workbench . Ten minutes later he had the chain tightened and the carburetor adjusted . The garage man was grinning . Technical competence always brought respect . Michael paid a fifty-dollar deposit and recalibrated his mind to driving on the left-hand side of the road , then took the Kawasaki out into evening traffic , running easy until he got the feel of driving in what always seemed the wrong way . He took the same route back to the hotel as he 'd come , picking up two plastic containers of bottled water on the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd walk . When the search needed to be expanded or he had to get somewhere in a hurry , the bike would take him there . Maigrit greeted him and said what a handsome machine Michael had found . Michael took out the picture of Jellie and said he was looking for her . Maigrit looked at it , then at Michael , and asked , 144 Robert James Waller  | " Amour ? " Michael smiled and nodded . Maigrit was sorry , but he 'd never seen her . " There are many Western women who come here to participate in the ashram . They look for comfort and inner peace , perhaps a new way of life . " The Frenchman no longer operated a restaurant in his hotel , but if Michael wanted continental food , the Alliance Francaise was not far , just opposite the Park Guest House . It was a club , though membership rules were not tightly enforced . Simply walk through the gate , cross the courtyard , and go up the steps . Michael thought twice about going there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he figured she wanted to sink back into Indian ways and would take her meals at Indian restaurants or , more likely , cook for herself . But word moved fast in these Indian towns , and he had a feeling the Western community would pass the news about a newcomer who wore jeans and sandals and seemed to be looking for someone . But he was hungry and was n't ready for Indian cuisine yet , so he walked through quiet streets in the direction the Frenchman had directed him . A few people sat on steps in this section of the city , but most of the houses were behind high walls . Two white men with shaved heads and wearing saffron-colored wraps , bare legs poking out from thigh level down , went by in the opposite direction , paying no attention to Michael . He turned left on Rue Bazare St. Laurent , missed his right turn on Rue Dumas , and came to Cours Chabrol  --  Beach Road  --  running along the seawall . The night breeze was kind , and Michael stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without crossing over to the seawall . The walkways were crowded with evening strollers . Off to his right , just up the road , was the gated entrance to the Park Guest House , the ashram 's hotel . When two Western women in Indian dress came along the sidewalk , he turned around , heading back up the street he had just come down , feeling odd , as if he were involved in an international espionage operation . Jellie , what have you done to me ? I was content , if not supremely happy , before we met , and here I am walking the back streets of India looking for you , and in some small part of me not wanting to find you , fearful of what you might say , of what you might tell me you are going to do with the rest of your life . A guard stood at the Alliance Francaise 's gate . Michael pointed at his own chest , then pointed inside and said , " Restaurant ? " The guard nodded and motioned him through the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off to one side was a cement platform where an Indian woman was dancing to the rhythm of a drummer sitting cross-legged in the shadows behind her . No one else was in the courtyard , but he could hear an accordion playing a French song in the building ahead of him . Michael watched the dancer for a moment . She was oblivious of him , stopping after a moment and speaking to the drummer , who then started off again in a slightly different rhythm . The first floor of the place had a unisex bathroom and a black-and-white photography exhibition hang-146 Robert James Waller  | ing on its gray walls . Music and laughter came from the floor above , and he went up the stairs into the restaurant . Half of it was covered , the rest was open to the night . Waiters were moving rapidly around in white uniforms , and a young Indian in dark slacks and purple shirt came toward Michael , speaking in French . Michael smiled and said , " Dinner , please ? " " Just one , monsieur ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you prefer indoors or outside ? " " Outside , please . " The maitre d ' seated Michael at a small table off in a corner . Michael 's entrance caused a few curious heads to turn , but the laughter and eating and drinking quickly resumed . He ordered beer and a chicken brochette from the open-flame barbecue built into the wall across the room from where he was seated . Stars were out , the scent of jasmine came on the night wind , and he sat there alone , staring at his hands . The food was excellent , served with rice and French bread . And chocolate cake with good strong coffee afterward . He was starting to feel somewhat whole again . On his way out , an older man had taken over the maitre d ' role . When Michael walked over to him , the man smiled warmly . " Did you enjoy your dinner ? " Michael told him it was very good , then showed him the picture of Jellie . The maitre d ' looked at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped smiling . " Have you seen her ? " Michael asked . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 147  | The maitre d ' stared at him and did n't answer . " I 'm looking for her ; it 's very important I find her . " The man lit a cigarette , looked at the picture again , then handed it back to Michael . " Long time ago , maybe . " " How long ? A week ? How long ? " " Long time . Ten , fifteen years . It 's hard to say ; the woman I 'm thinking of was much younger . Excuse me , I have work to do . " Michael took a deep breath and wondered . The man had looked at him . and the photo , friendliness turning to curt dismissal afterward , almost as if the maitre d ' recognized Jellie 's picture and wanted to be done with Michael as soon as possible . Michael walked back to his hotel through dark , quiet streets , still wondering . For two days he wandered Pondicherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the bike out to Auroville , but it was spread out over miles , little settlements and houses scattered about . If she was there , he 'd never find her . In early evenings he sat on the seawall near the ashram guest house and watched traffic coming for the evening meal . He tried talking with the austere woman guarding the front desk of the guest house , but that was useless . People came there to get away and be left alone . When Michael showed her the photo of Jellie , the woman shook her head and went back to her ledgers . He was getting nowhere and asked Maigrit for directions to the college he 'd read about in the guide . Maigrit ran his finger along the street map , showing 148 Robert James Waller  | Michael the location and how to get there . Michael wheeled the Kawasaki out of the hotel courtyard , kicked the starter , and rolled north through the city . The college was in a shabby section of Pondicherry . Cruising around the small campus , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Time to flash the credentials . He introduced himself to a secretary , telling her who he was and where he was from . This was a situation where titles would help . Indians loved credentials and respected professors only a little less than credentials . She went down a hallway into an office , coming back in less than a minute , followed by a short , round , Indian man in his fifties . He wore glasses and a necktie reaching about halfway down his chest . Friendly smile . " Ah , Dr. Tillman , how good of you to call on us . " He wanted to know all about Michael 's academic life . Michael ran the list of degrees and experience , impatient to get on with the reason he 'd come . But India observed its courtesies with a fair amount of pomp , and he was bound to reciprocate . Before long they were joined by two economists , with tea served by the secretary shortly after . One of the professors excused himself , saying he would return momentarily . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . It was opened to Michael 's article on tax incentives . He pointed to the article , then at Michael . " And did you write this , Dr. Tillman ? " Michael nodded . The professor smiled then , big smile . " Quite a brilliant piece of work . Very nice indeed . " Credibility had been established , Michael was on his home ground , and these were bright , decent peo-  | ple he was dealing with . He told them about searching for Jellie , leaving out the background details , saying only it was extremely important he locate her . They did n't recognize her photo , but when Michael mentioned Jellie 's interest in anthropology , the department head called to his secretary and spoke to her out in the hall . " I have requested my secretary summon one of the anthropology professors to talk with you . There are many projects in anthropology going on in Pondicherry . The French especially have strong interests in those areas , having established an institute some years ago with which our college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office doorway . She was fortyish and wore a pink sari . The department head stood , introducing her as Dr. Dhavale , professor of anthropology . The photo of Jellie , which was becoming a little shopworn after being held by a hundred hands in the last few days , was lying on the desk . Immediately the anthropology professor picked it up , glanced at it , then looked at Mi-chael . His heartbeat went up twenty points . " Is there any chance you know the woman in the picture ? " The professor 's face was cautious . " You say your name is Tillman ? Michael Tillman ? " " Yes . " " From a place called Cedar Bend ? " His pulse jumped another ten points . " Yes . " " May Dr. Tillman and I have words in private , please ? " She was addressing the department head . " Oh , yes , of course , Dr. Dhavale . Dr. Tillman , could we impose upon you to give a lecture or two  | while you are in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate it . " They 'd been helpful . Saying no was a problem , a matter of both courtesy and gratitude . " Dr. Ramani , I will be happy to do that sometime . First , however , I must not delay in finding Mrs. Braden . When I have done that , may I contact you and set up the lectures if I am going to be in Pondicherry ? " " Yes , yes , certainly . We understand , though we are disappointed you must hurry off . Please let us know when you can lecture for us , and we will set up a very nice afternoon with a reception afterwards . " Michael said he 'd do that and followed Dr. Dhavale out of the building across a courtyard into another building , where her tiny office was located . For the first time in seventy-two hours he did not feel tired . She sat across her desk from him , black eyes bold and cool , sizing him up . " Jellie Markham and I became friends years ago , during the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Jellie 's maiden name and the French pronunciation with the soft j ? JahLAY  --  for her first name . " We have corresponded with each other through the years and have remained close . " Michael said nothing but began to understand how dumb he 'd been for the last three days , using Jellie 's married name and the American pronunciation of her Christian name . Even if someone had known her , they would n't have recognized the names he was giving them if she 'd assumed the French version when she lived in Pondicherry . And that would make sense , given the heavy French atmosphere permeating the city .  | " Dr. Dhavale , I 'm forty-three . It took a lot of years for me to be able to feel about someone the way I feel about Jellie . I care for her , I need to find her , I need your help to do it . " The anthropologist studied him as if she were deciding on a final course grade . " I do not wish to violate her confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Tillman . But I know Jellie has strong feelings for you . She has lived a complicated life , more complicated than you can imagine . But those details are for her to tell you when she chooses . She sent a letter to you , giving you my name and address in case you wanted to contact her . But I do n't think she anticipated you would show up on my doorstep . Did you receive her letter ? " " No . I must have left before it arrived in Cedar Bend . I found you quite by accident . " " This is very difficult for me , Dr. Tillman , please understand that . I want to help you , but I do not wish to upset Jellie and ruin our friendship by saying what I should n't . I know she felt bad about not saying a proper good-bye to you . " Chitra Dhavale looked out the only window in her office , dusty window , then turned back to Michael . " She left several days ago for Thekkady . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a village quite near a beautiful place called Lake Periyar . Jellie told me you spent time in south India , so I thought you might have heard of it . She is staying with people named Sudhana who live in the countryside near Thekkady . " " May I ask what she is doing there ? Do you know ? "  | " Yes , I know , but that is part of what is not my place to tell you , and I am afraid I have already violated her confidence by saying what I have said . " " What is the best way to Thekkady ? The best route ? " " You could go back to Madras and fly to Cochin or Madurai , taking a car after that . Perhaps a better , though more tiring way is to take the early afternoon train out of Pondicherry . It is a meter-gauge railway , so you ride it just down to Villupuram Junction , which is approximately forty kilometers from here . From there you take the Trivandrum Mail southward and get off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hire a car and driver to take you on to Thekkady . It is an arduous trip , Dr. Tillman , but it is probably the quickest route . Your other alternative , flying out of Madras , may be frustrating . You might arrive there and not be able to find a seat on a flight for several days . " She looked at her watch . " It 's a little before twelve . If you hurry , Dr. Tillman , you can catch the one o'clock train to Villupuram . I have a feeling you are anxious to be on your way , am I not correct ? " She gave him a warm , Indian-woman smile . " If you find Jellie Markham , please tell her of my distress over this and ask her to forgive me if I have done wrong by telling you where she is . " " I will . Thank you , Dr. Dhavale . " As he went out her office door , Chitra Dhavale said , " Dr. Tillman ? " He turned , paused . " Jellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markham . Do n't ask me why . Just accept what I have told you . And I should add this : If  | you find her , things may seem somewhat strange and perhaps quite disappointing , or at least unsettling to you . As I said before , Jellie has lived a complicated life . " So it was the Trivandrum Mail south to Madurai and a car westward after that .  | Thekkady lies on the border between the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala , in the high country of southwest India . On the edge of town is a gate across the road , a red bar that reminded Michael of the old Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin . The driver halted and went into a small office near the road . Any moment Michael expected to hear Richard Burton 's voice speaking the words from a John Le Cane novel , something about a man coming in from the East tonight . All hell broke loose in the office . The driver showed his papers , but apparently crossing from one state to another in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to the next . From what Michael could make out , the Kerala authorities refused to honor the much trumpeted , all-India driver 's license .  | Michael got out , leaned against the car . More words that turned into shouting and what sounded like threats . He pointed to the bar , lifted his knapsack , and asked with sign language if he could cross . It was more complicated than he 'd thought , requiring a twenty-dollar bill in the hand of the border official to get him through after paying off the driver . Baksheesh , it 's called , and it was everywhere and always had been . Cool mountain air and thin yellow sunlight , quiet village in midafternoon , dusty road . Michael walked down it , his boots leaving deep footprints . " Hey , boss , you go lake ? " The young Indian man was standing by a jeep . Michael looked at a name scribbled in his pocket notebook , then walked over to the jeep man and said , " Maybe . Find people called Sudhana , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . " He whacked the side of the jeep . " Two hundred rupees for ride . Pretty place there . " It might be pretty , but that was n't where Michael was going . He held up three one-hundred-rupee bank notes . " Find house of Sudhana , first . Then two hundred more if I want to go to the lake . " It turned out maybe the jeep did n't have to go to the lake after all . The young man was in no hurry and started talking to several others hanging around . They looked at Michael and laughed . The young bastards were always brave in groups . They knew he had cash , big cash to them . Stuck in his belt , under his wrinkled bush jacket , was a short-bladed hunting knife he carried in these parts of the world . He could feel the handle pressing into his back . 156 Robert James Waller  | A few years ago he 'd held the knife against the throat of a taxi driver late one night in Mysore , north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young smart-asses was encouraging the driver to dump him and a female companion out of the cab . When the Mysore driver felt the blade against his skin he let out the clutch as if he were having a muscle spasm , knocking two of the smart boys on their rears . An older man came out of a store , shouting . From what Michael could tell , the man owned the jeep and was ordering a general shaping up and getting on with business . There was chatter in multiple dialects , the name Sudhana mentioned several times . The older man sketched on a piece of cardboard and handed it to the younger one , who had called Michael " boss . " He walked over to the jeep , grinning , patting the jump seat , and motioning with his head for Michael to climb in . The young one and another bundle of insolence about the same age got in the front seats . They bounced off down the dirt road and turned south onto a different road running high above the eastern side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low mountain , then left up a smaller road . The driver slammed to a stop in front of a house with tin patches on the sides and roof . " Sudhana , there ? " He pointed . " Cigarettes ? " Michael gave them each an American cigarette , which was something of a luxury in these parts . Both lit up immediately , and Michael walked on unsteady legs toward the house . The old doubts ? Was this the place ? Was he doing the right thing ? Jellie , do n't turn me away , do n't do that . Whatever is going on , let me be part of it . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 157  | The forehead and eyes of a crone appeared over a windowsill , then disappeared immediately when she saw the good-size white man walking toward her . " Sudhana ? " Michael called out . Nothing . " Jellie ? Jellie , it 's Michael . " Still nothing . Then slowly the door opened a crack , and the old woman looked out . She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . JahLAY . Jellie . . . JahLAY . " He said her name over and over again , then added the surname he had been told she might be using , and the words were strange on his tongue . " Jellie Velayudum . JahLAY Velayudum . " The woman shook her head , spoke rapidly in a croaking voice , and pointed in a direction that looked as if it were inside the house . Christ , had something happened or what ? Was Jellie lying in there ? The driver swaggered over to where Michael was trying to climb the wall between cultures . " Cigarette , boss ? I know what old woman is saying . " More baksheesh . You get a little tired of it after a while . It 's not the money or the smokes , it 's the bloody damned arrogance , the use of leverage . Michael gave him half a pack of Merits . " She say woman called JahLAY Velayudum is at old hunting lodge in the middle of the lake , place called Lake Palace Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the driver flipped his head toward the jeep . They went down around the mountain and got on the road along the river again . Seven minutes later the jeep came over a rise , and Lake Periyar looked blue and calm in the distance . The jeep driver dropped Michael off at the Aranya Nivas Hotel , a hundred yards from the lake-158 Robert James Waller  | shore . He asked for more cigarettes , and Michael told him to stuff it . Michael Tillman was tired of smart young bastards , whatever country they come from , and said as much . He 'd been too passive , too intent on finding Jellie , putting up with too much nonsense . The driver retreated in the face of Michael 's anger , shrugged his shoulders , and backed his jeep out of the hotel driveway . Michael went inside , grubby and tired . The woman at the desk was perfectly done , turquoise sari and a face that would launch a thousand Porsches back in the States . She was polite and efficient , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Palace Hotel . She told him it was an old maharajah 's hunting lodge with only six guest rooms and that reservations were handled here at the Aranya Nivas . While she flipped through a reservations book , Michael stared at a photograph on the wall behind her . It was slightly faded , but still a beautiful shot of a tiger coming out of tall grass on a foggy morning and carried the signature Robert Kincaid . The clerk said there were rooms available for the next four nights . After that it was completely booked for a week . Three continental meals each day were included in the price . The big question . He asked it : " I 'm supposed to meet a woman at the Lake Palace . I wonder if she has checked in yet . Her first name is Jellie . . . JahLAY . I believe she is registered under the name Velayudum , though she might be using Markham or Braden . " It all sounded rather suspicious , vaguely clandestine , but he had decided to cover all the bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 159  | there . " She looked up at him . " And you say you are to meet someone ? " " Yes . My arrival date , however , was uncertain . " " I have a Velayudum listed here . There are two people registered under that name . " Michael staggered inside himself . All the months , all the miles , the dreams . Forty-three , and he was standing there looking stupid while Jellie was registered under an Indian name and sharing the room with someone , most likely a man named Velayudum from somewhere back in her India days . Jellie  --  all the things I do n't know about you . Michael would always remember how alone he felt at that moment , incredibly alone and lonely and discarded . It must have shown , because the woman asked , " Sir , would you still like a room at the Lake Palace ? " He could go back to Madurai , fly to Madras , and change his homeward flight . Then he thought , This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not thinking clearly , afraid of what you might find in the middle of the lake . You 're not going anywhere except out to that hotel and hit the end of this at full speed , if that 's what it comes to . " Put me down for one night , please . The hotel is on an island , is that correct ? " " Yes , we call it an island . There is a narrow strip of swamp connecting it to the mainland . It 's approximately a twenty-minute boat ride from the jetty . " " What boat , what jetty ? " " Go out the front door , turn right , and walk down the path . You 'll see a small building with a sign 160 Robert James Waller  | reading Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary . ' Purchase your boat ticket there . The ticket agent will direct you to the proper boat . The island is in one of India 's largest tiger preserves , and since you will be staying there you must also purchase an entrance permit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle , you can make arrangements for a guide at the same time you purchase your boat ticket . Without a guide , you will not be allowed to leave the hotel grounds , since there are large animals about and it is much too dangerous . " As Michael turned to leave he asked , " Was the photograph behind you taken here ? " " Yes , on the island where the Lake Palace is located . I 'm told the photographer who took it came here often some years ago and always stayed at the Lake Palace . " Down the path to the sanctuary office . Hundreds of Indian tourists milling around on the jetty below and several old excursion boats rocking in the water . Michael handed the room voucher to a wildlife officer at the office . He issued a boat ticket , saying Michael should show his hotel voucher to the pilot of the Miss Lake Periyar . The pilot would then drop him off at the hotel . It was a mess . Travel was never easy in India , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two of them in the process of loading , one already packed with Indian tourists . Two hundred future boat passengers , porters , and assorted hangers-on were packed on the jetty . The loaded boat had Miss Lake Periyar painted on its starboard side .  | He fought his way through the crowd , got on the boat , and showed one of the hands the hotel voucher . The man seemed disinterested but nodded and indicated with a toss of his head that Michael should find a seat . The dominant feeling permeating all travel in India was one of ambiguity , and Michael had serious doubts as to whether the pilot would be notified he was to be dropped at the hotel . The boat was constructed with two levels , a glassed-in first level and an open upper deck . There were no seats left , but there was shouting and laughter and calls to those left on the jetty , the sum of which was pandemonium . Children ran up and down the steps between the first and second levels , people got off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on again . The boathand Michael had talked to was making a reasonable attempt at crowd control but was failing miserably , overwhelmed by the crush . How , Michael wondered , could any animals be spotted along the shore , if that indeed was the main thrust of the boat tour . The boat would sound like pharaoh 's army coming over the water toward them . The boathand got tough when the engine turned over . He ordered people to sit down and stay seated . Michael checked again , but every seat on the boat was filled , so he hunkered down on the steps leading to the upper deck with a young boy sitting on the step just below his feet . The boy twisted his neck and looked at him while Michael stared out over the water . The boat moved away from the jetty and chugged slowly down the huge , narrow lake , a reser-162 Robert James Waller  | voir stretching for miles behind the Periyar Dam , constructed by the British in 1895 . A narration came from small loudspeakers mounted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes in one of the Indian languages , telling the passengers they might see various animals ranging from leopards to tigers to elephants to wild pigs . Michael figured if they saw any animals at all , they 'd be flopped down in laughter at the strange mammals packed onto an old green contraption that should 've sunk twenty years ago . Late afternoon now , sun dropping . Michael 's boat and the two eventually following were the last sight-seeing runs of the day . Heavy jungle along the shore except for fifty feet or so of bare dirt running down to the water in some places . Michael stood up for a moment and could see a high hill with trees , looking as though it sat hard and straight in the boat 's course . Ten minutes later the boathand shook Michael 's knee and said , " Lake Palace . " Michael was tight , so tight his breath was coming in short little intakes and exhales , as if he were finishing a long sprint , which he was . Across the sunlit water of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly so , of what he was going to find ahead of him . A wooden jetty stuck out fifteen feet from the island 's shore , and he could see wide stone steps behind the jetty leading up into heavy forest . A long red tile roof was visible through breaks in the foliage . On the jetty was an Indian boy of about fifteen . The desk clerk at the Aranya Nivas had radioed the lodge to say a guest was on the Miss Lake Periyar . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 163  | The pilot expertly swung the boat broadside to the jetty 's end , and Michael jumped off . The boy pointed at the knapsack on Michael 's shoulder , and Michael gave it to him . They began the long climb up the stone steps to the lodge , which sat a hundred and fifty feet above them . Halfway up Michael touched the boy 's shoulder , signaling he wanted to stop for a moment . He sat on a wooden bench beside the steps , put his head in his hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steps and thinking about how he would handle whatever was there . The boy stood patiently , looking off into the jungle . After a minute or two , Michael got up and they continued . At the top of the stairs he followed the boy over a red dirt area where the jungle had been cut back around the entire circumference of the lodge . Off to Michael 's right an Indian couple sat on the veranda in front of their room . They were drinking tea but paused to watch the new arrival come across the dirt and onto the veranda south of them . The manager appeared with a room key , looked Michael over , and said dinner would be served at seven , adding informal dress was appropriate . He asked if he could get Michael something to drink . Michael ordered two Kingfisher beers and followed the boy along the veranda . The room was spacious with a double bed and a bath area in a separate room to the rear , furniture of slightly battered white wicker . Two large windows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an overhead fan turned slowly . A smaller window in the bath area also had the same 164 Robert James Waller  | heavy shutters . The boy put Michael 's knapsack on one of the beds and scurried around , turning on lights . Michael tipped him , and he was gone , closing the door behind him . Michael looked at his watch . Three hours before dinner . He showered and dressed in a clean khaki shirt and jeans , traded his boots for sandals , drinking Kingfisher and preparing himself for what was to come . He was ready , if there was any real way to be ready for what he was sure he 'd discover . No excuse to lounge around in the room , so he walked outside on the cement veranda , which was empty of people along the entire run of the lodge . A trench , about five feet deep and three feet wide , circled the lodge out beyond the open dirt area where the jungle began . Michael was pretty sure the trench was designed to hold at bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaled bellies , tongues flickering . The Indian couple he 'd seen earlier were standing near their room at the far end of the lodge . They were on the crest of a hill dropping off to the lake and were looking through binoculars at something across the water on the opposite shore . They called the boy over and asked him a question . " Wild pigs , " he said . Purple-blue flowers curled from the roof . Far down the lake Michael heard a sound . It took him a moment to recognize it : elephant . In the distance he could hear the low beating of an excursion boat 's engine . He sat there on the south end of a veranda in south India , lit a cigarette , and started on his second beer , feeling like a warrior about to enter battle . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 165  | Behind him and north along the veranda he heard a door open and the sound of voices , one of them Jellie 's , he thought . Adrenaline hit Michael Tillman 's arteries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his basketball days or , for that matter , ever before in any circumstance . The warrior had come to fight for his woman , his body was preparing itself . Now was the moment . Now  --  do it , Tillman . Do it and get it over with , settle your affairs , here in the jungle . Where else have men ever settled their affairs ? He turned and saw a young Indian woman , fifteen or sixteen years , come out of an open doorway . Her black shining hair was in a long braid , and she had on a sari of a deep orange color , bracelets on her arms and around one ankle , silver toe rings , and straw-colored sandals . Jellie Markham/Braden/Velayudum , or whoever she was on that day , came out of the same doorway and looked across the stretch of open dirt toward the jungle . " It 's a beautiful evening , Jaya , " Michael heard her say . The young woman answered her , " Yes , it is . This is the loveliest place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean and cool after the lowland heat . I 've always looked forward to our time here . " Jellie looked down the veranda , gray eyes taking in the scenery , casually glancing at a man sitting by himself at a table . The young woman started to speak but saw Jellie 's face and followed her eyes . They both stared for a moment , then the young woman looked again at Jellie 's face , but Jellie never took her eyes 166 Robert James Waller  | off Michael Tillman . He waited for a man named Velayudum to come out of the doorway and put his arm around Jellie , but no one came . Jellie was frozen where she stood . Michael looked back at her . She wore the traditional Indian woman 's outfit called a salwar kameese  --  long tunic and loose , flowing bottoms gathering themselves just above her white sandals , all of it done in the palest of lavenders . She had a red scarf draped around her neck with the ends of it hanging over her shoulders and down her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ankle bracelet and toe rings . Her hair shone in the half-light on the veranda , and hung straight and long , parted off to one side , just as she wore it back in Cedar Bend , sometimes tucking it up under a tweed cap . Cedar Bend ? Where in the hell was that ? Did it exist anymore , or had it ever existed ? Maybe .. . maybe somewhere in another time , somewhere back down along the crinkled chain of living and loving and working , it had once existed . Back in the same , forgotten , and ancient world as Custer , South Dakota , where a boy worked late in the night shooting baskets and repairing an old English motorcycle that would take him over the roads of his life , eventually with a woman named Jellie riding behind him . Jellie took the girl 's hand and came toward him . He stood up , saying nothing , watching her eyes , which never left his . She let go of the girl 's hand , put her arms around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He touched her hair . She lifted her face and kissed him .  | She turned to the girl . " Jaya , this is Michael Tillman , the man I 've been telling you about . " Her eyes on Michael 's face again , steady eyes . " Michael , this is my daughter , Jaya Velayudum. "  | Dhiren Velayudum : revolutionary , member of a radical separatist group that fought everyone and everything connected with the central Indian government . And Jellie Markham , young and idealistic back in the middle sixties , young and idealistic and off to India to write her thesis . Movie stuff : Tamil warrior-poet meets young American woman with her own dreams of how things ought to be . At bottom , Dhiren Velayudum was a terrorist , and Jellie became his lover and confidante . Though it did n't seem like terrorism in their nights of loving and days filled with quixotic visions of a great revolutionary flow that could not be halted . She married Dhiren in a traditional Indian ceremony . The shrieking death-dance of her parents when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syracuse . Things went bad for the radicals , and there were Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 169  | wild months of running with Dhiren , hiding in villages and cities . Then came an afternoon road winding high into the Western Ghats , the same road Michael would travel one day years later . The car in which Dhiren and Jellie were riding moved slowly around hairpin curves . Suddenly Dhiren was pushing Jellie , shouting for her to get out of the car and hide . She got out , carrying Jaya , and crouched behind a jumble of deadfall . Dhiren pitched from the other side of the car and ran for the trees on the opposite side of the road , ninemillimeter , Russian-made pistol in his hand . The sound of automatic weapons . Bullets spitting into the dust like an animal with a hundred claws tracking him and closing fast , then crawling up and across his body . Dhiren spinning , stumbling into the forest . That night at the Lake Palace Hotel , Jellie and Michael sat on the veranda for two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of it , leaving out nothing . How she felt about Dhiren , her memories of him . How she carried her baby along the night roads of south India after Dhiren had been shot , walking all night into Thekkady , where there were sympathizers with the radicals ' cause . How the India government punished her by refusing to issue an exit visa for Jaya so Jellie could take her to the States . She told him how Leonard Markham had come for her , all the way to Delhi , and the words he 'd said : " Let 's go home , Jellie . We 'll find a way to get your baby to America . " She looked off into the night . " It 's amazing what parents can forgive . " Jellie told him how she fought for years to get Jaya a visa and failed , her father helping her and 170 Robert James Waller  | pounding on authorities from Washington , D.C. , to New Delhi . But India put on its silent , impenetrable face , and nothing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms wrapped around them while she talked . " Chitra kept track of things on the Indian side and wrote to say it was still not possible to get the necessary papers for Jaya . I tried to come back , but the Indian government denied me an entrance visa . " Can you imagine the agony , Michael ? Three years it went on that way . I kept applying for a visa , and then for no reason I 've ever been able to figure out , they issued me one . I simply became unimportant to them after a while , I guess . " I could have given up my U.S. citizenship and perhaps become an Indian citizen , but I was n't ready to do that , and I 'm not sure India would have accepted me . I still believed I could get Jaya out of the country . I even thought about smuggling her out , but everyone I talked to said it was too risky , that I could end up in an Indian prison for years and leave Jaya without any mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When something important was being said , when attention was called for , Michael Tillman was a world-class listener . And he was listening now to what Jellie Braden was saying . He narrowed his eyes , then rubbed them with his palms , trying to settle himself as he started to understand things he had n't anticipated . It began to sink in , hard : he 'd underestimated Jellie . She was n't simply a bright , good-looking woman married to one of his colleagues . Instead , she had lived another life alien to anything he could have imagined . She was 1 Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 171  | far more an adult than he had realized , far more sophisticated in a worldly fashion than he would ever be . She was talking about a different Jellie , who had lived before , one he would not be able to comprehend or experience , no matter how much she told him , how much he thought about it . Jesus , automatic weapons and mountain roads , a man who had given her a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had laughed and cried with this man , and loved him wildly and freely and carried her baby as she ran with him . He felt a strange combination of sadness for her and envy for Dhiren Velayudum , who had touched places in her that he , Michael Tillman , could never touch . What a goddamned stupid joke , he thought , his wrong and undue assumptions about himself and Jellie and how he presumed Jellie saw him  --  for the last year he had been measuring Michael Tillman against Jimmy Braden , not against a man with the power and spirit of Dhiren Velayudum , a man who had lived for just the right amount of time and died at just the right moment to create a larger-than-life image in the far back memories ofJellie Braden . It was an image that would never have any equal , for it had never been lessened by the slog of ordinary , daily existence . Michael let out a long breath , while Jellie caught hers and continued . " All of this time Jaya was becoming a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she be raised in Indian ways . I did n't seem to have any other choice . The decision was made : Jaya would continue to live with the Sudhanas until she was old enough for boarding school , and I would visit her as often as I could .  | " I sent money to the Sudhanas , tormenting myself all these years that I was not here to see my little girl growing up . Yet I do n't know if it could have worked out any better . Jaya is a fine young woman . But I did visit every year , and we always came out here to the Lake Palace for a while . So at least she got to know her real mother pretty well , though we have become more like sisters than mother and daughter . I 've always saved most of my salary from whatever job I 've had over the years , and that money went to India , to the Sudhanas and to Jaya . She entered boarding school when she was six and has been there since . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said was I 'd been involved with an Indian man who had died and I still had a lot of friends over here who needed financial help . The lie rested in what I did n't say . I told him I would be coming alone to visit every year . Jimmy , I think , would have agreed to anything , just to get me to marry him  --  I know that sounds terrible , but it 's true  --  so he said it was not a problem . He 's never complained once about my visits to India , and he 's never asked any questions about what it is I do when I 'm over here . As I 've said before , Jimmy has his good qualities . " Michael got up and walked behind her , put his arms around her , and kissed her hair . Jellie Braden looked off into the night . Something large and moving fast crashed through the jungle fifty yards back of the lodge . Jellie stood and looked up at him , put her hands on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some ways , but I do n't want you to think you 're Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 173  | some kind of latter-day surrogate for him . That 's not true at all , and you must believe me when I say it . " He smiled and said , " I believe you , Jellie , " though he was n't quite as sure about it as he sounded . " I came to India this time because I needed to think and to talk with Jaya about us . I wanted to make sure of how I felt and for her to understand . When you found me this evening I was already turning for home , Michael . I was turning for home , toward you . In his room he laid her down and kissed her in all the places she liked to be kissed . Later there was heavy scratching at the door and the sense of great bulk moving around outside . Michael sat up . " What the hell is that ? Sounds like a bear . " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " " There used to be a lot of them in the Black Hills . They go on like that . I have some fruit in my knapsack , and the bear can probably smell it . He 'll go away after a bit . " The bear left and was replaced by the tickety-tick of fast little feet running over roof tiles . Michael and Jellie lay in the darkness together . " Sounds like India on the move again , " he whispered to her . Jellie went back to her room an hour before dawn . Michael lay awake , thinking about all they had talked about . Twenty minutes in front of first light he dressed and went outside into heavy , dripping fog wrapped around the lodge and turning open spaces into closed ones , turning the jungle into vague , threatening shapes in gray camouflage . Across the lake ,  | which was only about a hundred yards wide where the island divided it , a monkey called , sounding far and lonesome . The classic jungle sound from old Tarzan movies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more and was joined by a few others , along with intermittent calls from awakening birds . His small flashlight took him through the fog and down the stone steps to the water . Why he was doing this he was n't certain . Something to do with loving Jellie and knowing where he stood with her , a little early morning celebration of his own , some time to rearrange how he saw her in light of what she 'd told him about her early years in India . He sat on a jetty post where he could look out to the opposite side of the lake and down the shoreline to his right . He sat there and waited , listening for sounds beyond the lapping of small waves . First light came up , translucent through the fog . He was staring off into space , thinking about Jellie and Jaya asleep in the lodge above him , not looking at anything in particular . The fog swayed in an early breeze and began turning into a yellowish mist as the sun poked its way through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Michael saw him . The cat was thirty yards down the shore , drops of water coming off its muzzle as it lifted its head after drinking . It did n't move , just kept that big head pointing in Michael 's direction , its body still perpendicular to the water . Long red tongue came out and flicked away the droplets on its white chin . The plan ? What plan ? Stupid , Tillman , real dumb , Michael was thinking . The lodge was a forty-  | second sprint up a flight of steep , rough steps , or longer via a jungle route , and a Bengal in full stride could cover a hundred yards in four seconds . If the tiger wanted him , Michael could do nothing . Running would be pointless . And pathetic . Somehow , though , Michael was n't worried . He never quite understood why when he thought back on it . He just was n't . In fact , all the time he was thinking how serious wildlife watchers would give up their butterfly nets for life if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! merit badge , talk about counting coup . A lot of folks were out there practicing a kind of visual banditry and grunted sourly when the stagecoach did n't stop . It had stopped here , in the fog , at dawn . Michael began to take pleasure in just staring back at the tiger , in the simple purity of contemplating its existence , in knowing not everything wild and strong had been snuffed out by condos and shopping malls . There was something good and exhilarating about that , about knowing that creatures who crawled toward trenches or went bump against your shutters in the darkness or stared at you from a misty shoreline in south India were out there , and they cared nothing for your passing joys and sorrows , and they were free to return to the jungle when they chose . The tiger lowered its head , lapped at the water , looked at Michael again , then shambled down the shore in the opposite direction . At fifty yards it turned to look at Michael once more , looked at him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angled off into the jungle . The sun ran up its flag hard and bright , and the fog lifted . 176 Robert James Waller  | " Good morning , Michael . " It was Jellie , and Jaya , carrying cups of hot tea for themselves and a big cup of coffee for the tiger expert who was busy sewing a merit badge on his sleeve : Saw It ! Michael said nothing about the tiger , thinking they might feel sorry about having missed it and thereby spoiling a first-class sunrise for them . When he told them later they were both sorry and glad  --  sorry they 'd missed it , glad they were n't there . " Michael " ? her gray eyes were full of good , loving signals as they looked at him ? " we did n't talk about travel plans . Jaya and I are booked here for another three nights , can you stay ? " Stay ? He 'd have slugged it out with the Bengal for the privilege . " Jellie , I 'm free until mid January . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they say in India ? " Jaya smiled . " Well ... " Jellie was a little hesitant . He sensed it was money . " Let me suggest something . You 're looking at a guy who lives in a cheap apartment , drives a thirty-year-old motorcycle and a fifteen-year-old Dodge Dart , and makes a passable salary . If the two of you feel like it , let 's travel , go where we want to go . Take the canal boats through the Kerala estuaries , lay around up on the Goa coast for a while , ride the steamer up to Bombay and stay in the Taj Hotel . My treat and no holds barred . " " That will cost a lot of money . " She bent over and kissed him good morning . He whispered , " We can work it out on the kitchen table back in Cedar Bend . " She rolled her eyes . " My new profession now Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 177  | becomes clear . " Then Jellie laughed , and Jaya laughed , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laughing . But Michael thought he knew  --  she was laughing because her mother was laughing , because her mother was happy and loved a man and was n't afraid to let her see it . She 'd figure it out after a while . And they did that , traveled . Stayed on at the Lake Palace for three more nights , then went off to Kerala to see the famous Chinese fishing nets and stayed in the Malabar Hotel , where they swam in the pool and had late suppers served on white linen by the bay . They hit Goa and lounged on the beach , took the steamer to Bombay and checked into the Taj Hotel for five days . Flew up to Jaipur to see the Pink City and took a camel safari into the Rajasthani desert . On January 5 they put Jaya on a plane for Cochin and school , which left Jellie and Michael a week to themselves . They spent it in Pondicherry , staying with Innkeeper Maigrit ( " Ah , monsieur , you found her , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and taking their evening meals in the small restaurants of Pondicherry . They went far up the beach one afternoon and made love in the sand , then swain naked in the warm Bay of Bengal and made love again in the water . And Michael lectured at the college , paying his debt to Dr. Ramani . Jellie was moved by the fact Michael had booked his return flight for the twelfth of January , that he 'd been prepared to spend over seven weeks looking for her . He said , and meant it , " If I had n't found you by the sixth , I was going to call home and tell them to find a substitute for the spring semester . I was Jellie ,  | I truly mean this  --  fully prepared to go on with my knapsack until I found you , no matter how long it might have taken . " On January 12 they rode British Airways toward Heathrow , reading , laughing , holding hands . Then serious at times , preparing themselves for laying all of this in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greenland ice pack , Jellie leaned her head against Michael 's shoulder . He looked at the gray eyes , noticed something pensive in them . " What is it , Jellie ? " " I was just thinking . People once called Dhiren the Tiger of Morning .

Induction and tentative conclusion : 180 Robert James Waller  | Maybe Jellie Braden and Michael Tillman were more than friends . January evening 1982 , conclusion no longer tentative . Jimmy said he understood how Jellie and Michael would be attracted to each other . His primary concern was , in his words , " how we all carry on from here . " He seemed almost relieved , more worried about style than substance . Jellie was less rational and quite a lot less stylish than her husband at that moment . She 'd been married to Jimmy Braden for eleven years , that counted for something . She got herself worked up pretty good , telling Jimmy how sorry she was , how it was not right to behave as she had . Jimmy eventually said , " Our decision to marry was probably a good one at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with choices made by people who were different eleven years ago than they are now . " Jellie gathered herself and her things and moved in with Michael . They painted his old apartment and gradually converted it into something both of them could tolerate . The Shadow stayed in the living room . That was not open for debate or compromise . Jellie did suggest a dropcloth to protect the nice oak flooring from greasy tools . Michael smiled and said it was a large concession but agreed . He rolled back into teaching , dog-paddling his way through the wash of sideways looks and gossip that ultimately became a minor part of the university saga . Jellie retrieved her maiden name , finished her M.A. , and was accepted in the anthropology Ph.D . program . And Jimmy ? He went away .

Probably it was Jellie 's leather jacket , boots , and mirrored sunglasses that got her . It 'd been a long life , and she 'd hoped for something better . Michael and Jellie 's father escaped to the trout streams . Leonard Markham never said harsh words about anybody , and he mentioned Jimmy only once in Michael 's presence . He was laying out a Royal Coachman fly after several elegant backcasts . The Coachman landed soft as you please below a big rock where the water eddied .

Leonard twitched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better of the enterprise and left the fly alone , in the way Leonard Markham left the subject of Jimmy Braden and never came back to it . Jellie and Michael traveled to India once a year . In 1984 they brought Jaya back to meet her grandparents . Afterward the three of them visited Michael 's  | mother , who was confined to a nursing home in Rapid City . She was old and pretty wobbly , but sentient most of the time .

So it went . Not undiluted peace and tranquillity , but workable part of the time , most of the time . Michael Tillman was a loner , something of a recluse , always had been , always would be . He would go away from Jellie , sometimes on the Shadow , sometimes only in his mind . And she resented that .

" Jellie received her doctorate in 1987 . Michael was allowed to attend the ceremony in full academic regalia , though his robe and soft , six-pointed cap , which had lain unused for years , needed two runs at the dry cleaners before they were presentable . When she walked across the stage and was handed her diploma , he damn near fainted with pride , knowing how much it meant to her . Michael threw a small party for her at the apartment and had a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shadow and 186 Robert James Waller  | watched her gray eyes as people congratulated her .

Michael was still sitting on the Shadow , barefoot in T-shirt and jeans , a bottle of champagne balanced on the gas tank . He said , " Dr. Markham , I presume . " She grinned that old salacious grin of hers , the one she put on when it was time for serious matters of the flesh , then parted the robe and showed him she was wearing nothing beneath it . " Dr. Markham is now ready for her graduation present , if Dr. Tillman is prepared .

The driver came to full alert as the truck skidded , fought to control his rig , and saw the yellow slicker fluttering a hundred feet straight ahead of where his hood ornament pointed . Michael was blinded by the lights , truck closing and no way to lay the Shadow down and slide . He thought of Jellie and tigers .

He concentrated on Jellie 's face , formed it up cool and clean in his mind , got her to smile for him , and he was still around in the morning . Outside his room at the desk guarding the intensive care unit , he vaguely heard a panicked voice . " Where 's Michael Tillman , please , I 'm his wife . " His wife  --  he 'd never thought of Jellie that way . She bent over him : " Oh , Michael . . . Michael . I came as fast as I could . Michael , get better , and I 'll take care of you forever . Do n't worry , it 'll all be fine . " " Jellie , touch my face .

Jellie was crying but trying to hide it from him . He floated in and out of consciousness for days , but finally the old body decided to give him another chance . He blinked open his eyes on a rainy Tuesday . She was sitting near his bed and looked up at him , smiling . " Welcome back , Michael . " In a few weeks Michael was on his feet , with Jellie 's help , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a patient patient ; his mind called for action while his body wanted rest . After the casts were off , Jellie would come home from the university , where she was working as a temporary instructor , and find him attempting push-ups or sitting bent over his desk chair , trying to make the muscles in his arms learn to type again . " For God 's sake , Michael , I 'm doing all I can do to get you better , and you 're not helping . I have classes and shopping and you , and that 's a full load . You have to cooperate a little , take things slow as the doctor said . And do n't look at me in that little boy cranky way of yours ; I 'm too busy for nonsense . " " I feel inadequate , that 's all . Sloppy , too , lying around here drawing disability pay . " " Think of it as if you were practicing the jumpshot , Michael . Invest now , get the benefits later . " " Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the logician , Michael , except when it comes to yourself . "  | " That puts me in the great mainstream , right ? Only time I 've ever been there , and I do n't like the feel of it . " " Well , you can like it or not like it . I 'm going to the library . I have six hours of preparation to do for the survey course . " She put on her coat and stomped out . Two hours later she called him from a pay phone in the library . " You okay ? " " Yep . The little boy is no longer cranky and will attempt to remain as such . Sorry for the hassle . Christ , I did this to myself , and now I 'm externalizing the results of my own stupidity on to you . " " Michael , I love you , really I do . But it 's not easy sometimes . You understand that , do n't you ? " " Yep again . Do you really have six hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just escaping from the Walnut Street rehab ward for a while . I think I 'll come home and fix us something to eat . " " Wrong . I 'll rustle up some soup or its equivalent , have it bubbling when you get here . " Eventually , Michael 's ability to type came back , ideas started to form , and the computer screen glowed blue in the evenings . After three months he could walk outside by himself and started jogging slowly a few weeks afterward . There was laughter again , and there was loving . But living with Michael 's intensity was not easy . Jellie had known it before the accident , and that intensity came back even stronger as he recovered . It was constant , unrelenting , a never-ending push toward frontiers of the mind and spirit , frontiers he redefined  | as he approached them , causing them to recede so the chase could go on . Michael chased frontiers and Jellie helped him chase the things he lost because his mind was always somewhere else , never paying attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft of an article . " Michael , you do n't look ' well . You riffle around through a stack of something or shove things here and there on top of the refrigerator and think you 've really searched . After that , you yell , Jellie , have you seen . . . ? ' " " I use the lost horse method for finding things . " He was eating an apple and had just finished complaining that he could n't find last month 's paycheck , which he was taking to the bank as soon as he located his car keys and found his gloves . " What 's the lost horse method ? " He was holding the apple between his teeth and scrounging around on top of the refrigerator , talking through the apple at the same time . He sounded as if he had a severe speech defect . " If you lose a horse , go where you saw him last and start there . " " What if you took the horse somewhere , to start with , and forgot where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't work , would it ? " " All my methods are flawed . " He grinned , flipping the half-eaten apple over his shoulder from behind his back and catching it with his other hand . " Help me find the goddamn check , Jellie , so I can then look for my goddamned keys after which I 'll search for my goddamned gloves . Please , Jellie . You 're looking at a disabled searcher . All men have 192 Robert James Waller  | the disability ; it 's another one of those many flaws in the Y chromosome . " Jellie continued working as a temporary instructor at the university and enjoyed the teaching . Michael became more and more unhappy with the constraints of an academic bureaucracy that operated , as he saw it , for its own benefit , for its own survival and nothing else . Jellie could ignore that , and took delight instead in her students and her own research . This was new territory for her ; Michael was more than two decades into it . In 1990 , after talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jellie had misgivings about the move , about surrendering her own professional life to follow the drift of Michael 's ways . But he had been unhappy at the university , and there was the possibility of a teaching position for her at Spearfish State . Life in the canyon was quiet and pleasant , but Jellie was restless . Though Michael worked alone and enjoyed it , Jellie needed an organization , a place where she could teach and do conventional research in her field . A year later Jellie went to India alone . The birth of Jaya 's second child was a complicated delivery , and she needed help afterward . Jellie stayed on longer than she 'd intended . Two months , three months . India starting pulling on her again , Elsa Markham 's genes turning her in directions that pointed a long way from White Bear Canyon and the problems of living close with a difficult man . A French architect from Auroville invited her out to dinner . He was handsome , worldly . She went with him once to the Alliance Francaise but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 193  | seem fair to Michael . The architect continued to call her . He sent flowers , left notes tacked to her door . Michael knew nothing about the Frenchman , but he was worried . He called and asked , " When are you coming back ? " His voice was pensive . " I do n't know , " she said in a flat , noncommittal way . " There 's a job for you at Spearfish State beginning next fall . They called two days ago . " " I do n't know right now . That 's all I can say . " Spearfish State versus the excitement of a cosmopolitan life in Pondicherry . Dinners at the Alliance Francaise , a handsome Frenchman who was smooth and attentive , who seemed to understand and appreciate the feelings of women . She went out with him again . He wanted to take her to Paris and show her around . It was simple , uncomplicated , living this way . No problems . And she was near Jaya and the grandchildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never had been . The university in Pondicherry offered her a part-time job , and she almost went to bed with the Frenchman on a night when the sweet smell of jasmine rode on slow winds from the Bay of Bengal , but she pulled back at the last minute . She was falling into something different , another life that seemed far off now . The next time she would n't pull back . Michael called again . His voice was cooler than she remembered . He 'd lived alone before , he could do it again , she knew that . He 'd come to India after her once ; he would n't do it a second time . When they said good-bye , his voice changed , got a little soft and sad . 194 Robert James Waller  | " I miss you , Jellie/JahLAY . " And she cried then for reasons she did n't under-stand . In the white sun of an India morning , the seawall at Pondicherry curved into the distance and looked like something from Mediterranean lands . Come evening , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city breathed out the heat of the day just past . After talking with Michael , Jellie walked to the seawall and sat there for a long time . A slice of yellow moon hung thirty degrees up , off in the general direction of Burma . Back home she went to a mirror and looked at herself . Fifty-one . The Frenchman said she looked no more than forty . Men still turned to watch her when she passed , and that was good , she supposed . She brushed her long black hair , straightened her scarf , and returned to the mirror . She whispered , " Jellie Markham . . . Jellie . . . the song is almost finished . Just what the hell are you doing here when the only man you truly care for is half a world away ? " Two days later she walked slowly along a winding road in the high country near Thekkady . Dhiren seemed far back . Twenty-five years had passed since that day of blood and fear in the dust now covering her feet . The afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log and remembered her warriorpoet , remembered him and the way he touched her , remembered him running for the trees . That evening she visited an old woman named Sudhana . They ate simple food and talked of other times .  | Chitra Dhavale rode with Jellie to the airport in Madras . " I 'll miss you , Jellie , but I am glad you are going back . It 's the right thing . " " What a strange , messy life it 's been , Chitra . Irresponsible , too . " Jellie had tears in her eyes . They were standing near the gate to Jellie 's plane . Chitra put her arms around her and said , " Yes ... strange and messy . . . and irresponsible in some ways , I suppose . All of that . . . and quite wonderful also when you think about it , depending on who 's doing the measuring and by what standards . But you at least know what it 's like to come into high plumage and catch the southern winds . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky person who can have a single great love in her life . You 've had two . One when you were a girl , and the other when you became a woman . Jellie smiled then . " And one was a warrior-poet and the other is a motorcycle man . God help us all . " They laughed together while she dried her tears , and forty minutes later Air India lifted off . Chitra Dhavale watched morning light flash from the 747 's wings as it turned toward South Dakota . Jellie had not told Michael she was returning and rode the airport limo by herself from Rapid City through the Black Hills . On the front porch of the cabin in White Bear Canyon was a disassembled motorcycle , the Shadow II . Michael had found it six months before at a convention of motorcycle enthusiasts and was rebuilding it . It would never take the place of the old Shadow destroyed in the accident , he
