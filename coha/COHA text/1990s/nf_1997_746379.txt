" After a well played , close win , an experienced assistant coach stands in the parking lot and listens with pride , and increased embarrassment , as a grandmother praises the work he has done with her three grandsons over the course of 15 years of coaching . Finally , he leaves and within 24 hours accompanies his wife to a local mall . Walking down the aisle of a book store , he suddenly encounters the parents of a player who was marginal as a junior , and was ' cut ' as a senior because he just was not going to get any playing time . Upon seeing the coach , the mother grabs the father 's arm , forcefully pulling him from the store , while loudly exclaiming , ' I ca n't stand to be in the same store as that man . ' " <p> The parents of athletes can either be a valuable source of support or an unbelievable origin of stress and frustration to a coach ( Tutko and Richards , 1971 ) . Parental stress is often enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching career ( Lackey , 1986 ) . It has led many coaches and administrators to observe that ( a ) sports would be perfect if not for parents ( b ) we should hold matches and not allow parents to attend ( c ) the best coaching job would be in an orphanage ; or , simply , ( d ) " WHAT DO PARENTS WANT ? ? ? " <p> Hopper and Jeffries ( 1990 ) identified the relationship between coaches and parents of their athletes as one of the most important , yet overlooked , areas of sport . They linked the quality of communication and understanding between these two groups with the general success of any athletic program . Because of the levels of interest and involvement parents exhibit in their child 's athletic experiences , coaches and administrators should strive for the highest levels of communication and understanding possible . <p> Mach ( 1994 ) observed the irony that while few parents get involved in the academic lives of their children , it is virtually impossible to keep them out of the child 's athletic involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous examination , clarification and attempts at mutual understanding . At least half of the individuals ( parents and players ) involved in sport are changing annually , and the goals and objectives of coaches can change as well . To reduce some of the stress in coaching and lessen the probability of coach/parent conflict , every effort should be made to promote positive communication between these groups . The purpose of this study was to compare previously reported responses of parents ( Stewart , 1994 ) with additional groups of parents of athletes on what coaching characteristics they valued most . These comparisons were made to determine if parental values were different as levels of competition or program objectives changed . In addition , the responses of coaches as to how they thought parents valued their characteristics were examined for sources of misunderstanding . A similar study by DeVoe and Carroll ( 1994 ) on the differences between coaches ' perceptions of why athletes participate and why coaches thought players participated helped identify areas of misunderstanding in the coach/ player relationship . Parental expectations of coaches , how those expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if different perceptions between coaches and parents existed , would provide equally valuable information in the improvement of communication and understanding between them . <p> Stewart ( 1994 ) reported the results of an extensive questionnaire completed by 167 parents of high school athletes . Part of the findings was a determination of what characteristics the parents valued most in coaches of their children . As a result of that study , it was determined that parents of these high school athletes felt that ( a ) fairness and honesty in dealing with athletes ( b ) commitment to having the athletes enjoy their sport ; and ( c ) the development of sportsmanship , were the three most valued characteristics of coaches . The remaining seven characteristics were divided into three groups with ' a commitment to winning ' alone in last place . Stewart ( 1994 ) concluded that coaches and parents will probably disagree on some goals and objectives of any program , but a clear examination of what both groups want for the team is essential . Another consideration of that study was , possibly , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . This study is a result of that speculation , and a continuation of attempts to promote the understanding of two very import groups in athletics , coaches and parents . Purpose <p> The purpose of this study was to expand on the information reported in Stewart ( 1994 ) by determining how other groups of parents ranked coaching characteristics . In addition , a search for a source of disagreement between coaches and parents was initiated by asking a group of coaches how they thought parents would rank coaching characteristics , and then comparing those re-suits with parental reactions . It was hypothesized that by examining parents of athletes from other competitive levels , and comparing them with coaches ' perceptions of what parents wanted , additional sources of misunderstanding or " miscommunication " between the groups could be identified . That identification process would assist coaches and athletic administrators in understanding parental expectations , and , hopefully , improve communication between all the adults in the athletic environment . Method <p> A questionnaire ( see Figure 1 ) was developed which required parents to rank 10 coaching characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Martens , 1990 ) , and Program for Athletic Coaches ' Education ( PACE ) ( Seefeldt &; Brown , ed. , 1991 ) . The questionnaire was then slightly modified to determine how coaches felt that parents ranked characteristics . <p> According to Whitley ( 1996 ) , three conditions must be met for comparative ranking scales to provide reliable and valid results . First , the parents must be familiar with the items they were to compare . Secondly , the characteristics on which the items were to be ranked must be unidimentional . Finally , the parents had to understand the characteristics being ranked . It was assumed that the questionnaire fulfilled all of these criteria . Subjects <p> The subjects responding in this study were from three groups of adults , parents of state ODP players , parents of regional ODP players , and coaches involved in various levels of coaching soccer . <p> 1 ) PARENTS OF STATE OLYMPIC DEVELOPMENT ( ODP ) SOCCER PLAYERS : <p> The parents of two hundred state Olympic Development Program ( ODP ) male soccer players were mailed questionnaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program of the United States Youth Soccer Association is a highly competitive program for male and female players ages 13 through 18 . Within all states , players compete for positions on the " State ODP " teams . Those state teams then compete at regional camps and tournaments from which four Regional teams are selected . Those Regional teams compete at additional tournaments from which National Pools are developed . The process is ongoing and occurs annually . The National , Under 23 teams , compete internationally and represent the USA in the Summer Olympics . The National Teams compete in such tournaments as the World Cup . <p> One hundred and eighty-three ( 183 ) parents returned questionnaires to the investigator by the summer of 1995 . Those players , ages 14 , 15 &; 16 years , represented the best soccer players from 14 western states and attended a regional selection camp in Bozeman , Montana . <p> 2 ) PARENTS OF REGIONAL ODP SOCCER PLAYERS : <p> The parents ( 100 adults ) of 50 regionally selected female soccer players were mailed questionnaires in the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODP teams from the western region returned questionnaires in the fall and winter of 1995 . Those players , ages 14 &; 15 , had been selected at a regional camp in Oregon as the " best of the best " from the 14 western states and attended national tournaments in Florida . <p> 3 ) REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ODP SOCCER COACHES : <p> In January of 1996 , 100 questionnaires were distributed at a national coaching symposium at the Olympic Training site in Southern California . Sixty-nine regional and national level soccer coaches who attended returned completed questionnaires . The group of coaches had an average of 14.35 years of coaching experience ranging from individual private clubs and public high schools to university and national level teams . All of the coaches had advanced coaching credentials , with over one third ( 28 ) having earned the highest level ( USSF " A " ) of certification . Results <p> Initially , the responses of all the parents of the soccer players were combined with parental responses from the study by Stewart in 1994 . The total group of parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to least preferred ( see Table 1 ) . The characteristics were divided into four groups of characteristics based upon non-para-metric statistical analysis , Friedman ANOVA of Ranks , ( Chi 2 = 239.21 ; p&lt;/=.001 ) ( Siegel and Castellan , 1988 ) . The separation is designated by dotted lines on Table 1 . <p> When parental responses were examined separately , they were quite similar ( see Tables 2-4 ) . Based upon modified Bonferroni ( Conover , 1971 ) analysis of variance ( df = 2/426 ; p&lt;/= .0033 ) there were only two areas where the parent groups differed ; 4 . COMMITMENT TO HAVING PLAYERS ENJOY THEIR SPORT ( f = 9.39 ; p = .0001 ) &; 6 . PROVIDING AN EXPERIENCE WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE CHILD 'S CHANCE TO PLAY AT HIGHER LEVEL ( f = 6.71 ; p = .0014 ) . <p> An examination of mean rankings ( Tables 2-4 ) revealed that parents of high school players were less concerned with having their children improve their chances at playing at higher levels , and more concerned about their children enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This result is not surprising since the ODP goals are to develop and select the best players from states and regions , therefore contributing to national teams at every age group ( Olympic Development Program Administrative Guideline , 1995 ) . The goals are communicated to parents within the ODP throughout the players ' involvement in the program . <p> Finally , the coaches ' responses were contrasted with those of the parents ( see Figure 2 ) . The intent was to identify areas in which a ) what coaches thought parents valued and b ) what parents said they valued , were different . It is within these areas where the potential for miscommunication and conflict between parents and coaches exists . When the parents were treated as a complete group and compared ( df = 1/495 ; p. &lt;/=01 ) with coaching responses , areas for potential miscommunication were ( a ) development of sportsmanship ( f = 9.71 ; p = .0019 ) and ( b ) providing experience leading to play at higher level ( f = 7.47 ; p = .0065 ) . <p> Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on playing at a higher level than coaches thought they would . When only ODP parents were compared with coaches ' responses there was a change ( see Figure 3 ) . There was less of a difference in the values placed on ( a ) development of sportsmanship and ( b ) providing experience leading to play at higher level ; between coaches and parents in Olympic Development Programs , but in the area of ( c ) commitment to enjoyment , parents were less concerned than coaches anticipated . CONCLUSIONS <p> Thompson ( 1995 ) stated that more than any other factor , parents present one of the most difficult factors in a coach 's existence . One of the primary desires of parents is to be in close communication , or within the " informational loop " , with the coach . Within that informational loop is the area of what characteristics parent value in a coach of their children . The results of this study contributed to the determination that parents , overall , value coaches who are ( a ) fair and honest in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sport , and ( c ) can teach well . <p> However , parental values changed when levels of competition changed . In this study , there were differences between what coaches thought parents wanted and what parents reported they wanted in the areas of ( a ) development of sportsmanship ( Parents cared more than coaches thought they did. ) and ( b ) providing experiences leading to a higher level of play ( Parents cared less than coaches thought they did . ) . Therefore coaches need to be aware that , if they coach at different levels or in different programs , parental values might change . Coaches who attempt to coach the same way at various levels risk an increase in parent conflicts . <p> When just the parents of ODP players were compared to ODP coaches , then another area for conflict between parents and coaches was ( a ) commitment to enjoyment ( Parents cared less than coaches thought they did . ) . SUMMARY <p> The results of this study reinforce the need for coaches and parents to communicate openly and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various athletic programs in which coaches are involved , differ . The findings further support the determination of Hopper and Jeffries ( 1990 ) that because the goals of parents and coaches often conflict , positive working relationships between them should not be neglected . Coaches will reduce the potential for stress if they accept that open communication with parents means determining the answer to the question , " What do parents want ? " both in a program and a coach . If a coach will establish goals , objectives , and the methods needed to achieve them , with a better understanding of what parents value , a more positive athletic environment can be achieved . However , opening two way communication with parents , and understanding what parents value , does not mean that the coach loses the ability to pursue competitive , personal goals . In fact , the parents and coaches in this study were in agreement on how most coaching characteristics were valued . Nonetheless , the areas of disagreement were extremely important . Parents , in general , cared more about the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels than coaches thought they did . This finding supported Stewart 's ( 1996 ) determination that the role of sportsmanship in the athletic experiences of children is very important to parents . A coach who ignores that feeling faces dire consequences . To avoid parent conflicts , coaches need to recognize areas of difference and , at least , discuss them with parents . After open discussions , coaches can decide if changes are necessary in their methods or objectives , or , at the extreme , if the coach needs to eliminate himself/herself from that environment . <p> On the other hand , parents in the Olympic Development Program were not as concerned about their children enjoying the sport as coaches perceived . That knowledge is also important , but should not cause coaches to make participation in more competitive , highly selective programs less fun . It should assist coaches in knowing that many parents understand that goals and objectives will change with different programs . Possibly , it would allow coaches of ODP teams to spend more time on teaching skills , and honest , fair communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " activities . <p> Regardless of how coaches react to the exchange of ideas between parents and themselves , the need for continued examination of how the two groups can improve their relationship is apparent . Mothers and fathers are a perpetual component in the coach-player-parent triad , and if not considered , will be a continued source of concern and stress for coaches and administrators ( Cilo , 1990 ; Lackey , 1986 ; Mach , 1994 ; Stewart , 1994 ) <p> In any quasi-experiemental study , the findings never present the perfect solution . However , this study and Stewart 's in 1994 , represent contributions to the determination of areas of agreement and conflict between the two most important adult groups in a young athlete 's environment . In addition , it provides evidence that many parents and coaches are closer to being in agreement than previsously thought . Therefore , when problems in athletics originates , it could be from only a vocal minority of parents . <p> Hellstadt ( 1987 ) depicted the involvement of parents as a continuum from " under involved " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but perhaps there are additional parental characteristics , other than involvement , to be considered by the coach . Those considerations would be the continuum of " agreement of purpose " between the coach and the parent , or at minimum , an acknowledgement by parents that the coaching characteristics reflected in this study are often related to the objectives of the program . Perhaps the parent who agrees with the overall goals of the athletic program is less likely to become the " problem parent " . Certainly , when there is no agreement or understanding , conflict is imminent . The result of that conflict is detrimental to the program , the team , the season , the coach and the athlete . Ultimately , it drives many good coaches out of the profession , a result sport can not afford . <p> Figure 1 : Parent Questionnaire <p> Parental Attitudes Toward Coaching Characteristics : <p> Please rank from 10 ( highest ) to 1 ( lowest ) the MOST important characteristics for a coach of your child . <p> ( Please note : Responses which use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study . ) <p>  --  knowledge of the skills of the sport <p>  --  knowledge of the rules of the sport <p>  --  commitment to winning <p>  --  experience as a player of the sport coached <p>  --  commitment to the development of sportsmanship <p>  --  knowledge of prevention , care and rehabilitation of injuries the ability to teach well <p>  --  commitment to having players enjoy their sport <p>  --  fairness and honesty in dealing with athletes <p>  --  providing an experience which will improve your child 's chances of playing at a higher level ( varsity , college , Olympics , professional ) <p>  --  What state ( Alaska , Cal-N , Utah , etc ) did your daughter represent last summer ? <p> Which parent completed this questionnaire ? <p>  --  father <p>  --  mother <p> ( check one please ) PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> GRAPH : Figure 2 .
