For all his financial troubles , Donald Trump remains a master of the theatrical gesture . Negotiating with dozens of bankers in Manhattan on a plan to restructure his $2 billion debt , he suddenly proclaimed it was time for lunch . Trump went to the phone , called a nearby McDonald 's from memory and ordered 25 Big Macs and 25 Quarter Pounders . Hamburgers , he declared , were among his favorite foods . Coming from a person who was asking to borrow an additional $65 million , this was just the kind of down-to-earth taste the bankers were hoping to find . <P> In the deal of his life , Trump won his battle to avoid bankruptcy last week but was forced to give his bankers financial control over his empire and his purse strings . A total of 77 lenders agreed in principle to give him a five- year , $65 million cash infusion to enable the overleveraged tycoon to meet a $43 million interest payment on junk bonds issued to finance Trump 's Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City . Failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a chain reaction of defaults . " This is a deal that will go down in the textbooks as the way banks and entrepreneurs should deal with each other , " Trump declared . Not everybody agreed . Said a banker : " I think it 's a tremendous black eye on the American banking system when a guy who acts the way he does gets $2 billion in loans . " <P> The rescue , which included an agreement to suspend interest payments on $850 million of Trump 's loans , put the flamboyant developer on a short leash . Trump agreed to submit his business decisions to the banks for review and promised to hire a chief financial officer to scrutinize the Trump Organization , which manages his holdings . " Trump wo n't have to get permission to go to the toilet , but on anything else he 'll have to ask the banks , " quipped a Wall Street expert familiar with the deal . <P> Even worse for Trump 's ego , the big spender will have to subsist on a % monthly allowance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he spent on food , shelter and other living expenses in May , Trump will be required to limit himself to a merely stupendous $450,000 a month for the rest of 1990 . His allowance will shrink to $375,000 in 1991 and a stingy $300,000 in 1992 . <P> Much of the money covers the upkeep on his three Pharaonic homes . The annual maintenance for Trump 's 45-room spread in Greenwich , Conn. , comes to an estimated $400,000 . His Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach , Fla. , costs about $1 million a year to run . His allowance will also have to cover $650,000 in annual support payments for his estranged wife Ivana and their three children . Exempted from the budget is Trump 's fancy transportation , which is up for sale : his $30 million yacht , the 282-ft . Trump Princess ( he says he wants $115 million for it ) ; his $8 million , French-built Super Puma helicopter ; and his $8 million personal 727 jet . <P> Bankers went along with the agreement , which amounts to a privately arranged bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties will rise . Trump could then sell many of his holdings to raise cash to repay his loans . But if the depressed Northeastern real estate market fails to improve , Trump could still wind up in bankruptcy court .
