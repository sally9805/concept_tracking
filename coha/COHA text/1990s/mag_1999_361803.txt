Here are just a couple of tales from the rough frontier of Texas justice : a teenager in Bexar County charged with drug crimes last September sat in jail for a month before his first scheduled meeting with a court-appointed lawyer . That attorney never showed up ; and by the time the boy met the next one , he 'd been behind bars more than three months . Andrew Cantu of Abilene was executed in February even though his third court-assigned appellate lawyer  --  the first two withdrew  --  did n't know how to find Cantu in prison , did n't do any investigation of the case and was unaware of the deadline for filing his final federal appeal . <P> Texas ' reputation as a state without tender mercies for the accused is nowhere more apparent than in how it deals with defendants too poor to hire lawyers . They are provided with appointed counsel , but the competency of these lawyers , the rates they are paid and the speed with which they are assigned have shocked even impartial criminal-justice experts . <P> Now Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a " compassionate conservative , " having just vetoed a bill intended to improve the system modestly . The bill 's requirement that a defendant be given a lawyer within 20 days or else be released was " a danger to public safety , " Bush said , though in most of the country indigent defendants are assigned lawyers within 72 hours . Bush had some political cover because even a few of the bill 's supporters pulled back with concerns about giving county commissioners too much power to select the lawyers . But the front-running G.O.P. presidential candidate could still find himself embroiled in a debate about the sorry state of indigent defense , not just in Texas but in the rest of the U.S. as well . For one thing , the Supreme Court will consider later this year whether to tighten the standard for legal competency , after hearing a case involving bungled defense work on behalf of a convicted Virginia murderer with an appointed lawyer . <P> In 1997 nearly 10 million Americans were arrested , up more than 8% from four years earlier . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lawyers sleep through witness testimony , show up drunk for trial or miss crucial filing deadlines ? What if they ca n't afford forensics tests or , as in the case of Roberto Miranda 's lawyer in Nevada , fail to investigate their cases aggressively ? Miranda was freed in 1996 from death row after 14 years when a judge found that a key witness had not been interviewed . <P> " Lack of funds is the first and foremost reason we have the situation we do , " says Stephen Bright , who heads Atlanta 's Southern Center for Human Rights . State public defenders and court-appointed lawyers typically make less than other lawyers  --  sometimes less than the minimum wage . Alabama 's legislature last year voted an increase in the $1,000 top fee for lawyers handling death-penalty cases only to have the Governor veto it . In New York fees are actually shrinking ; the state 's chief judge recently reduced fees for lawyers representing death-penalty cases .                    @
