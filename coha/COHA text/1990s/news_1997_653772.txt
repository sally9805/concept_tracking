<p> GERALD APPEL is a longtime practitioner of an out-of-favor art : market timing . Using mathematical models , Mr. Appel , 64 , zips in and out of the market with the more than $300 million he manages , hoping to catch the rising waves and skirt the plunges . In a world where " buy and hold " is investment gospel , such short-term moves are seen as a heretical strategy that does not improve returns and incurs high commissions . <p> Nevertheless , Mr. Appel , who has run his investment advisory firm , the Signalert Corporation , since 1973 , has done relatively well . In a ranking of 61 newsletters of various investment styles by Mark Hulbert , editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest , Mr. Appel 's composite results over the last 10 years place him first on a risk-adjusted basis , and 15th without such adjustment . <p> In the following interview , conducted in his firm 's office in Great Neck , N.Y. , Mr. Appel describes the workings of his models , his belief that Wall Street has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's market is on the rebound  --  and that America 's looks better now than it did two or three months ago . MICHAEL BRUSH Q. Tell me about your investing style . A. We time various markets  --  the primary American market , represented by the Standard &; Poor 's 500 or the Dow ; the secondary American market , reflected by Nasdaq or the Russell 2000 ; various international markets ; the bond markets , and the gold markets . Within the United States , we also look at the technology area and a few other areas that are especially significant . <p> Based upon our timing models , we then trade mutual funds . If we think gold , say , will go up in price , we 'll buy a gold fund . If we think gold will go down , we will transfer the money into a money market fund and wait for the next gold buy signal . We 're essentially fairly short-term traders . Q. How do your models work ? A. I do n't want to go into what triggers the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically what we 're measuring is price and breadth momentum in the market , and we 're looking for shifts . <p> Generally , a buy signal can occur when a short- or intermediate-term market decline is losing downside momentum . Prices are beginning to find technical support ; market breadth is beginning to improve and there is at least minor reversal in price . The sell signal is basically the reverse . Upside momentum and breadth begin to weaken , and the price begins to turn down . Q. How do you measure the breadth of the market ? A. There are three or four measures we mainly use . One is the weekly advances and the weekly declines on the New York Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq . That 's the number of stocks that have risen in price for the week compared with the number of stocks that have fallen . These numbers may tell a different tale from the market averages . For example , it 's possible for Nasdaq to be up because a few stocks like Intel or Microsoft are up , but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the number of stocks making new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows on both indexes . It 's the same question : Though a market average may be at its high , what 's the real amount of participation going into this advance ? Or how many stocks are really collapsing even though the average is coming down ? A lot of times , these measures change direction before the popular averages do . <p> Another measure of market breadth is the percentage of stocks in up trends , which we define as standing above their 30-week moving averages . For example , even though as we speak the Dow is at a high , only 74 percent of stocks are in up trends . In 1995 , over 90 percent were in up trends . So even though the major market averages are higher , the typical stock is not nearly as strong . Q. Do you trade only in mutual funds ? A. We do very little trading in stocks , for a couple of reasons . We happen to be better market timers than we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid . And market timing is a little bit like predicting a Presidential election . The pollsters could tell with great certainty that Clinton was a sure winner the last go-round . But they could not tell very well how any individual voter might vote . It 's the same thing with the stock market . It 's a lot easier to call the market than to call a stock . Q. What do you think of the American markets today ? A. We are , at this point , in an intermediate up trend . We got a buy signal on April 28 and we 've been in the market ever since . Q. Is the current market a good one for you to be doing what you do ? A. The whole period between the summer of 1990 and this year has been more atypical than typical . There was not a market decline of 10 percent in all those years and normally you see at least one a year . <p> So we 've had a steady up market and this has not been great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best thing you could do would be to stay still . And this is , I think , why people are suddenly asking if timing is worthwhile at all . <p> This steady up market reflects a confluence of factors . The declining deficit  --  Clinton did a very good job with that . The end of the cold war  --  and for that you probably have to give Presidents Bush and Reagan some credit , although they spent a lot of money doing it . An internationalization of corporate profit structures . And then there were a lot of layoffs . All these came together in a stable political and inflationary climate . <p> But now some people wonder about the rise in stocks taking some fundamental parameters to levels we just have n't seen before . It used to be considered extremely bearish if stock market dividends fell to below 3 percent . We are down to about 1.85 percent now , which means stocks are maybe 60 percent higher than they were at the 3 percent level . <p> Real market tops after the kind of bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , the market top of 1972 , before the last really serious bear market , took almost a year to form . Then the advances became narrower and narrower and you really hit a bad market in a lot of stocks long before people knew it from the Dow . Q. Do you see a similar market top forming now ? A. I would have thought so two or three months ago , but the broader market indexes , like the Value Line Composite or the Russell 2000 , have been overtaking the narrow indexes , like the Dow or the S. &; P. 500 , in relative strength . But this is something we need to watch . Q. Was there one time when you called something absolutely right ? A. We had two real good occasions when we had all our clients and subscribers out of the stock market in the weeks before the crash in 1987 and again in 1989 . Q. How did you know ? A. The things we spoke about before ; the market beginning to fail . In 1987 there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keeping up with the Dow . Q. And what about specific sectors ? A. Well , we called the turn on the Japanese market pretty well just a few weeks ago . Japan seems to be making a very significant comeback after a nine-year bear market . And I do n't really know the ins and outs of the Japanese economy  --  I just see the technical patterns of the stock market and I would say that they look kind of ready for a serious emergence and that any period of decline there over the next few weeks will probably be a good time to enter . Q. What have been your big misses ? A. Nothing is ever really big because of the way we trade . In other words , if we have gold sell signals , we 'll sell , and if gold turns up the next day we simply buy it back . It takes so little to get us in and out . If I had to take a guess , I 'd say we were premature in calling for a reversal in the small-cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing is bad for investors . One by Sanford Bernstein &; Company shows that if investors miss just the 10 best days in the market over a period of years , the average annual returns are off several percentage points annually . A. Let me take that study . It said that between 1980 and 1989 , the S. &; P. had an average annual return of 17.6 percent . If you missed the 10 best days , your return fell to 12.7 percent and if you missed the 20 best days , your return fell to 9.6 percent . But let 's see what happens if you miss the worst 10 days . According to a study by Ned Davis Research , your return pops up from 17.6 percent to 27 percent and then if you avoid the worst 20 days your return pops up to 31 percent . So I do n't know why they played that study on one side . <p> Anyway , most people use timing in just about everything . If you go out to buy a car , you wait until there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop when prices look inexpensive . Why should n't it be the same with stocks ? They get expensive and they get cheap . <p> So why do people say market timing is a bad thing ? Well , the mutual-fund fellows are going to say it because the last thing they want is to encourage market panic . Can you imagine them going out on the network to all their customers and saying : " Liquidate your holdings . There 's going to be a bear market . Move everything to a money market . " ? So they 've got to say , no , this is the long haul . <p> But what is the long haul ? Fidelity Magellan has had three portfolio managers over the last several years . It has had a portfolio turnover of 136 percent since 1990 . So what are you buying with Magellan ? Are you buying a buy-and-hold approach ? The brokerage houses do an awful amount of timing , too . There are good timers and bad timers , but I think there 's a lot of vested interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a bull market for years . The psychology now is the market 's always going to come back , even though that 's not always so . <p> But some arguments against timing have a certain validity . Q. Such as ? A. Those concerning the tax treatment of short-term capital gains versus long-term capital gains . Q. Short-term gains get treated as income , and therefore are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains . And timing may result in lots of short-term trades . A. Right . So , I 'd say , though people do n't think about it , a timed portfolio lives in a natural habitat of tax-advantaged accounts  --  I.R.A . ' s , pension accounts , things like that . <p> Another argument against timing is that one must have the psychology to go against the crowd . A lot of times , you 're entering the market when things do n't look good and exiting when things do look good . That 's a hard thing for some people to do . <p> But one big argument for timing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of studies bear this out . Let 's say the Dow 's at about 7,300 . Suppose you have a sort of timing model that would take you out of the market on a Dow decline to 7,000 . Say the Dow goes down to 7,000 , then to about 6,500 , then comes back up . You go back into the market by your model at the same 7,000 . So you can say that nothing really good has happened as a result of the transaction . <p> But you were out of the market during the worst of the psychological climate . And you do n't know how far down that market would have gone , and whether you would have panicked . You re-entered at the same level with your portfolio value showing very little fluctuation , whereas otherwise it would have shown maybe twice as much fluctuation . Q. Do you have any advice for people who want to try timing on their own ? A. Some basic things work surprisingly well . One , of course , is what Marty Zweig , the market-timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Fed too much . One simple indicator people can use is the direction of interest rates reflected by short-term government bonds , three- to five-year bonds . If rates are higher than they were about six or seven months ago it 's a dangerous time to own stocks  --  not necessarily a fatal time , but a dangerous time . We just did a study , going back to 1970 , that showed this . And if rates are lower than they were six or seven months ago  --  now , they 're down from about 5.3 percent to about 5 percent , and stable  --  it 's generally a favorable time to hold stock . <p> The other thing is to watch the weekly advance-decline line on the New York Stock Exchange . As long as it 's in an up trend you could pretty well stay put . Let 's take 10,000 as an arbitrary number . You take the number of stocks to advance or decline for the week  --  say it was 2,000 up and 1,500 down , for a net of plus 500 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance-decline line is 10,500 . As long as that line generally keeps zigzagging up , making new highs , the market can be held .
