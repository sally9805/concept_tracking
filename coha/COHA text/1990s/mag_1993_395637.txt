Well , this is the final sage of the Washington Post interview procedure , " says the editor of the newspaper 's new Sunday magazine . " Talking to Ben . " Jay Lovinger and I walk through the cavernous newsroom toward executive editor Ben Bradlee 's glassed-in office at the north wall . Around me hundreds of reporters sit at computer terminals banging away . A few sneak surreptitious glances at me . No one makes eye contact except the two sisters at the switchboard . I feel like a side of beef hooked on a pulley in a meat refrigerator , circling for the buyer 's inspection . It is April 1986 . " Everyone hired at the Post talks to Ben . He is an incredible interviewer , " Lovinger says . " Oh , really ? " I say . I almost say " Ow , really , " as a needle of excruciating pain shoots up from the cramped space between my little toe and the one next to it . My feet , in three-inch heels , are killing me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great , " I say . What I really want o say is " Likes me ? Who gives a damn if they like me ? This is a writing job , not a personality contest , is n't it ? " " The metro editors even want you for their staff , " Lovinger says , as if conferring some much-coveted status . " They were intrigued by your perspective . " I 'm not surprised . Two white males running the metropolitan desk in a 70-percent Black city that is also the nation 's capital are probably in a constant state of intrigue . Mostly involving how to parlay that job into a better , whiter one . " If everything goes well with Ben , then we 'll talk money , " he says as we near the glass office , guarded by a fierce-looking redhead . " Just be yourself , " he cautions . I turn to look at him to see if he 's trying to be funny , but he 's dead serious . I decide not to ask him who else but myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smooth the folds of my turquoise Ultrasuede dress , lick my lips and wiggle my toes , trying to get a wad of Dr. Scholl 's lamb 's wool from my foot pad between my toes  --  the only thing standing between me and triple-minority status : Black , female and handicapped  --  back into a more functional position . But by now I am tired of being " on . " For me , the notion of coming to work at the Washington Post is mostly about money , but that 's a Black thing , which they would n't understand . For 12 years I have lived happily in New York as a successful yet poor freelance writer . I never thought about working for anyone but myself . Then one night the phone rang and it was Jay Lovinger , the man who 's now escorting me to Bradlee 's office . " Hello , " he said . " I 'm the new editor of the new Washington Post magazine , and we 'd like to talk to you about working with us . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cut to the chase : " What salary range are you offering ? " The figure , twice what I earned the year before , gets me on a plane to this interview . " What 's Bradlee 's interview technique like ? " I ask . " Fascinating . Absolutely fascinating . Do n't be surprised if he does most of the talking . He usually does . He 'll tell you about himself to find out about you . Even though you may not say much , Ben is incredibly insightful . He 's an amazing judge of character . " " That 's interesting , " I say , and relax . This I can deal with . White-boy interview technique 101 , in which he talks about himself to see if I can deal with him , which means he can deal with me . I did n't go to prep school and Columbia University 's Graduate School of Journalism for nothing . My parents will be happy their money was n't wasted . THE CHANCE TO HAVE IT ALL " This is Jill Nelson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the secretary-sentinel . " Go right in , " she says and smiles . " Good luck , " says Lovinger . I am momentarily stunned when I enter Bradlee 's office . I 'm expecting Jason Robards from All the President 's Men , tall , gray and handsome . Instead I 'm greeted by a short , wrinkled gnome . " Ben Bradlee . Nice to meet you . Sit down , " he booms . Well , at least he has Jason Robards 's voice . I sit . " Tell me something about yourself . " Temporarily my mind is null and void . All I can think to tell him is that my feet are killing me and that , in a static-cling war with my dress , my slip has risen up to encircle my waist . Then an ancient Temptations song pops into my head  --  " Papa Was a Rollin " Stone . " For years the words to this song which I did n't particularly like when it was a hit in 1972 , spring to mind when I 'm queried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song defines the authentic Negro experience . But truthfully Papa was n't a rolling stone , he was a dentist , Mommy was a businesswoman and librarian , we were solidly upper-middle-class . Besides , I remind myself , this is the 1980 's . The day of the glorification of the stereotypical poor , pathological Negro is over . Just like the South , it is time for the Black Bourgeoisie to rise again . I am a foot soldier in that army . So I tell Bradlee , briefly , about my educational and journalistic background . Am I imagining it , or is he really impatient for me to shut up ? " Let me tell you about my magazine , " Bradlee says , almost before my lips have closed over my last word . " I want it to have an identity of its own , but at the same time be a mixture of Esquire , New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine . I want it to be provocative , insightful , funny and controversial , " he goes on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talks and talks , struck by the notion of defining a new magazine by old ones , and old tired ones at that . I try to imagine myself , an African-American female , working and thriving at a publication that 's an amalgam of white man at his best , a celebration of yuppiedom and of " all the news that fits , we print . " I come up blank . " So , have you always lived in New York ? " Again , I snap back . " Yes . Except for three years at a prep school and a year I lived on Martha 's Vineyard . " " Martha 's Vineyard . How 'd you wind up there ? " It is the first time he has seemed sincerely interested in anything I 've said . After all , only the best people wind up on the Vineyard . " My parents have a home there . I 've spent summers on the Vineyard since I was a child and just decided to spend a year there and write , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that the threatening Black guy asking for a handout on the street is actually a Harvard classmate fallen on hard times . The bond of the Vineyard makes me safe , a person like him . Our eyes meet and I know I 'm over . The job is mine . Simply by evoking residence on Martha 's Vineyard , I have separated wheat from chaff , belongers from aspirers , rebellious chip-on-the-shoulder Negroes from middle-class , responsible ones . Vanquished is the leftist ghost of my years writing for the Village Voice . Gone are the fears he might have had about my fitting in after a life as a freelance writer , an advocacy journalist , a free Black . By dint of summers spent on Martha 's Vineyard , I am , in his eyes , safe . I may be the darker sister , but I 'm still a sister . I will fit into the Washington Post family . A feeling of foreboding expands geometrically around me . I shake it off and concentrate on willing my brain and feet into numbness . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Ben has communicated his feelings to the editors  --  probably by talking about himself  --  and I 've been offered a job on the magazine . I have no feeling left in my feet , and I 'm just about brain-dead . I do n't like the vibes around here . No one makes eye contact , no one speaks , everyone watches . In nearly eight hours , the only people who 've said squat to me besides editors are the sisters at the switchboard . I am not optimistic about the future . I am so whipped after being " on " all day that I do n't even have the energy to smile superficially . Since ten in the morning I 've hobbled from cubicle to cubicle , white male to white male , being interrogated . I feel like a felon up for parole trying to cop a plea with the commissioners . I 've also been doing the standard Negro balancing act when it comes to dealing with white folks , which involves sufficiently blurring the edges of my being so that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a thin line between Uncle Tomming and Mau Mauing . To step over that line can mean disaster . On one side lie employment and self-hatred , on the other , the equally dubious honor of unemployment with integrity . In the middle lies something like employment with honor , although I 'm not sure exactly how that works . I keep getting this creepy feeling that the Washington Post is doing me some kind of favor . It 's as if , as an African-American female freelance writer , I 'm a handicapped person they 've decided to mainstream . The words to " Look at Me , I 'm Walking , " the theme song of Jerry Lewis 's Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Telethon , pop into my head . The thought of all those bills being pledged to a good cause makes me think about my favorite cause  --  me  --  and my interview with Tom Wilkinson , the money man . As far as I can tell , all he does is talk with people about money and deliver bad news . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a tough institution . Most of our people have worked their way up from smaller papers . Do you think you 'll be able to fit in , handle the demands of working for a daily newspaper ? " " I think freelancers , people who work for themselves , work harder than people who have job-jobs , " I say , trying not to sound as exhausted and borderline sullen as I am . " We hope you 'll come and work here . Everyone liked you , " Wilkinson says . Here we go again with the popularity contest . I 'm glad I wore the turquoise dress . I smile , cross my legs , and think of James Brown singing " You can have Watergate . Just gim me some bucks and I 'll be straight ! " Then I recross them . " Now , let 's talk about salary . How much money did you make last year ? " I stare at him . He sits , an intense man in his forties with a weasellike face , waiting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lie . " About $40,000 . " " We can offer you $42,500 . " " Well , the editor mentioned ... " " Forty-five thousand dollars , " he interrupts . I feel like a damaged urn underbid at a Sotheby 's auction . Get me off the block fast and maybe no one will notice the cracks . " I was thinking more of ... " " Without newspaper experience , I think that is a good starting salary . Of course , if things work out well , there 'll be raises and that sort of thing . " " I understand that , " I say , " but I 'll be moving both myself and my daughter . She has to go to school and ... " " All right , $50,000 , " he snaps . I can almost hear a voice saying , " Going once , going twice , gone . " I 'm not sure anymore which way is which . " Fine . But I need a few days to think about it . " Now he looks really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made about $20,000 , so $50,000 would be a hefty raise . So why do I have a feeling of impending doom ? " Please let me know your decision as soon as possible , " Lovinger says as I leave , sticking his long neck and nearly bald head inside the elevator doors . " We 'd like you to be a part of what we 're trying to do . " It 's as if I 'm being recruited to join a crusade , but no one will tell me its objective . " I will , " I say . The doors close . I fall back against the wall and do some deep yogic breathing . My pantyhose feels like a girdle , slowly cutting off the circulation from feet to waist . I barely manage to cross the street to the Madison Hotel , where my daughter , Misu , age 13 , awaits me . " Hi , Misu . I 'm back . " My daughter sits propped up on one of the two double beds , watching television . She is brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  trays , frilly paper things , silverware and the smell of grease  --  surrounds her . " Sorry I took so long . " My daughter , a hotel abuser from way back , shrugs . Being left alone in a room she does n't have to clean up , with television and room service , is a significant element in her vision of nirvana . " That 's okay , Mom . How 'd it go ? " " Okay . But really weird , " I say , yanking off my shoes and stockings in one effective but less than fluid movement . I walk into the bathroom , turn on the water and begin scraping mascara and eyeliner from my face before I 'm blinded . " I do n't really think the Washington Post is the place for me ... " I begin , shouting to be heard above the roar of Madison water . " I like it here , Mom . I think we should move here , " my daughter says . " Why ? " I ask , drying my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I try to keep my tone neutral . " The buildings are small . The people are nice . And it 's clean , " she says . " If we lived here , we 'd live in a house , right ? Then we could have a car and lots of cats and a dog and all that stuff , like the Cosbys , could n't we ? " I open my mouth to point out that the Cosbys do n't have cats or dogs , that they have a father , that they live in New York . Then I look at the dreamy expression on my daughter 's face and close my mouth again . Abruptly it all becomes clear to me . My daughter is tired of being a leftist . She is tired of eccentric clothes , artists , vegetarian diets , the New York subway and living in an apartment . The culturally rich and genteel poverty in which she was raised has played out . Deep in her little African-American heart , she yearns to be Vanessa Huxtable , her age cohort in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect house , with perfect parents and lots of perfectly hip clothes in the closet . She is sick of my sixties class-suicide trip , of middle-class Mommy 's vow of poverty in pursuit of the authentic Negro experience . She is tired , simply , of hanging in there with my trip . She 's got a point . I 'm tired , too . Taking the job would not only fulfill some of her fantasies , it would also provide me with a ready-made escape from New York . Let 's face it . I 'm burnt out and dread answering the telephone . I 'm dating a mortician who ' about to lose his business , which is located in the heart of the area with the most liquor stores and highest death rate in the city . At 34 , postdivorce , I am again living with my own mommy . How much worse could Washington be ? Still , I have a stress stomachache and the feeling that I 'm about to make the wrong decision for all the right reasons . I had the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three months later we move to Washington , my promised land , my own private little hajj , except that I am journeying to the nation 's capital instead of to Mecca . My motives are not very spiritual . If there is any religion involved at all , it is " spiritual materialism . " I am coming in from the cold of activist journalism , leftist politics and poverty , and moving into the mainstream of " objective " journalism and more money than I 've ever made . Not too long ago , when I showed up at my mother 's house in a long skirt , she called me an anachronism . Over time I have come to suspect she was right . I 've watched colleagues ascend the ladder of financial success and corporate irresponsibility . Meanwhile , I continued to write about Black folks , work at home and be poor . Clearly it was time for me to change . I was finally going to present myself to society , but instead of having the cotillion I had rejected on political principle in 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Washington Post . " Is the house nice ? " " I think you 'll like it . " My daughter and I are in a cab coming from the airport . " I wish I could have seen it before we moved . " " Why ? It 's nice , " I say . Misu sits looking out the window at blocks of well-tended yards choking with azaleas . " You 'll like it , do n't worry . " " I 'm not worried , " she says . Then after a pause she adds , " It 's just that you know how you are , Mom , kinda weird . So am I , but I do n't want a weird house this time . " " It 's not weird , it 's nice . " Misu 's look tells me she 's wondering if I know the difference . I smile . " You 'll see , " I say . She nods grimly . The taxi stops in front of the house I have rented . A walkway in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Azaleas , lilies and peonies line the walkway , tumbling onto the path . A magnolia tree in flower stands on one side of the doorway , a pine on the other . The mingled scents of magnolias and peonies hang in the air . Beside the door is a black wrought-iron dog with a flat blade across its back , which is a boot scraper . The nonracist equivalent of a black jockey holding a lantern , it signals that we have arrived . " Look out , Cosbys ! " my daughter whoops and jumps out of the cab , laughing . I watch her run into the house . As the taxi driver tries to compute the fare based on how many zones we 've passed through , I sit there , feeling like Rod Serling . THE PRICE OF THE TICKET That night I dream about my father , but it is really more a memory than a dream . " Number one ! Not two ! Number one ! " my father intones from the head of the breakfast table . The four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten-foot teak expanse , our faces rigid . At the foot , my mother looks up at my I father , the expression on her face a mixture of pride , anxiety and  --  could it be ?  --  boredom . I am 12 . It is 1965 . " You kids have got to be , not number two , " he roars , his dark face turning darker from the effort to communicate . He holds up his index and middle fingers . " But number ... " Here he pauses dramatically , a preacher going for revelation , his four children a rapt congregation , my mother a smitten church sister . " Number one ! " These last words he shouts while lowering his index finger . My father has great big black hands , long , perfectly shaped fingers with oval nails so vast they seem to be landscapes . The half-moons leading to the cuticle take up most of the nail and seem ever-encroaching threatening to swallow up his fingertips , then his whole hand . When he shouted " Number one ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust up and at us , a phallic symbol to spur us  --  my sister , Lynn , 15 , and my brothers , Stanley and Ralph , 13 and 9  --  on to greatness , to number-oneness . My father 's rich , heavy voice rolled down the length of the table , breaking and washing over our four trembling bodies . When I wake up , I am trembling again , but it 's because the air conditioner , a luxury in New York but a necessity in D.C. , is set too high . I turn it down , check on Misu , light a cigarette and think about the dream . It was n't until my parents had separated and Sunday breakfasts were no more that I faced the fact that my father 's symbol for number one was the world 's sign language for " fuck you . " I know my father knew this , but I still have n't figured out what he meant by it . Were we to become number one and go out and fuck the world ? If we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending his children a mixed message ? If so , what was he trying to say ? In the dining room of the 11-room apartment we lived in  --  we were the only Black family in a building my father had threatened to file a discrimination suit to get into  --  my father delivered the gospel according to him . The recurring theme was the necessity that each of us be number one , but my father preached about whatever was on his mind : current events , Black heroes , Black sellouts , our responsibility as privileged children , his personal family history . We all had our favorite sermons . Mine was the " Rockefeller would n't let his dog shit in our dining room " sermon . " You think we 're doing well ? " my father would begin , looking into each of our four faces . We knew better than to venture a response . For my father , even now , conversations are lectures . Please save your applause  --  and questions  --  until the end . " And we are , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West End Avenue . I 'm a professional . Your mother does n't have to work . You all go to private school . We go to Martha 's Vineyard in the summer . But what we have we have because 100,000 other Black people have n't made it . Have nothing ! Live like dogs ! " Look around you , " he continued . With the long arm that supported his heavy hand he indicated the dining room . I looked around : at the eight-foot china cabinet gleaming from the weekly oiling administered by Margie , our housekeeper , filled to bursting with my maternal grandmother 's china and silver . We were living kind of good , I thought . That notion lasted only an instant . " Nelson Rockefeller would n't let his dog shit in here ! " my father roared . " What we have , compared with what Rockefeller and the people who rule the world have , is nothing . Nothing ! Not even good enough for his dog . You four have to remember that and do better than I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Black people . You have to be number one . " I 've spent a good part of my life trying to figure out what my father meant by number one . Born poor and dark in Washington , I think he was trying , in his own way , to protect us from the crushing assumptions of failure that he and his generation grew up with . I like to think he was simply saying , like the army , " Be all that you can be , " but I 'm still not sure . For years I was haunted by the specter of number two gaining on me , of never having a house nice enough for Rockefeller dog shit , of my father 's middle finger admonishing me . I 've spent a good portion of my life trying to be a good race woman and number one at the same time . Tomorrow I go to work at the Washington Post magazine , a first . Falling asleep , I wonder if that 's the same as being number one . Excerpted by permission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jill Nelson . Published in May 1993 by the Noble Press . <p>
