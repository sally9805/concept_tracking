Shortcuts to the Greener Office // The most **26;222;TOOLONG place you step into all day may be the one in which you spend most of your waking hours . What 's that hostile environment ? It 's your office . Think about it . The workplace welter of electronics gobbles watts , the office copier fairly inhales paper , and the air is tainted with the toxic perfume wafting from furniture , carpeting and rubber cement . But work does n't have to be hazardous to your health . There are a number of ways to make our offices more user-friendly . Taming the Watt Gobblers Watt for watt , computers , fax machines , copiers and other electronic workhorses that outfit our office spaces are n't in the same league as the real energy gobblers back home . Burning on average 150 kilowatt hours ( Kwh ) of energy a year , according to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , the office computer is a fuel miser compared to , say , a clothes dryer ( 1,060 Kwh ) . Fax machines and printers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack in pure power pull unit by unit , they make up for in sheer numbers . The nationwide fleet of high-tech office devices consumes some five percent of total commercial electricity in the U.S. , at a cost to the business community of over $2 billion annually . The loss to the environment is just as dramatic : In the process of fueling the country 's fleet of office machines , power plants emit as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as nearly 14 million automobiles . In the early 1990s , the EPA began issuing efficiency standards for a range of office electronics and encouraging manufacturers to meet them . The EnergyStar program is a hit , resulting in a raft of machines that tug lightly on the plug . How lightly ? For computers , it 's no more than 30 watts per hour during periods of inactivity , when the computer has powered down to sleep mode . That 's roughly 80 percent less than a standard computer , which runs full tilt when operating . More than 450 computer models from both large and small manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full list of compliant brands from the EPA , or check out the nearest computer warehouse store . Certified computers are stickered with the EnergyStar logo , a star under a half moon . Under EnergyStar , the EPA has also set energy-efficiency standards for fax machines , printers and copiers ( which are particularly hard on the environment ) . The energy draw of high-end copiers can equal that of 20 desktop computers , and certain kinds of copiers can emit a form of ground-level ozone , a respiratory pollutant . Photograph Studio eg 's modular office furniture is formaldehyde-free and produced from recycled materials . // EnergyStar standards for copiers , classified according to copying speed , include provisions for low-power modes , offmodes ( since some copiers continue to run when " off " ) , and double-sided printing ( duplexing ) . Similar green standards for copiers have been established by Green Seal , a nonprofit certifying group in Washington , D.C. The group has certified nine copiers , all of which are also EnergyStar compliant .

Greener Paper Even with duplexing , office copiers are about as friendly to the forest as a clear cut , consuming over 700 billion pages annually , roughly five reams for every American . So , in addition to adopting proven strategies for reducing paper waste-duplexing , reducing copier image size , emailing inter-office memos or recycling-it makes sense to switch to paper that creates the smallest environmental impact . The copy papers recommended most highly by Green Seal both exceed the federal government 's minimum requirement for the amount of recycled fiber in office paper ( 20 percent ) , and are free of the chlorine-tpe bleach that produces dioxin , a carcinogen . Half of the fibers in Arbokem 's Downtown Paper #3 , for example , are post-consumer waste ; Eureka 100 Premium Recycled Paper , manufactured by the Fort James Corpora tion , contains 100 percent recycled con tent . Fibers in both papers have not been rebleached in the recycling process . Eco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . The solid wood in some furniture comes from tropical rainforests . Furniture manufactured from fiberboard is better for the forests , but it may come at some cost to your health , as pressed board may waft noxious formaldehyde into your office space , along with volatile organic compounds ; paints and finishes may sully the air even more . Buying used or refurbished furniture will keep more timber standing and save money , since refurbished furniture can cost up to 70 percent less than its boughtnew cousin . You can find refurbishers in the Yellow Pages or from the Office Furniture Recycler 's Forum . If you do go shopping for new office furniture , look for green options . The wood in furniture certified by the Rainforest Alliance 's SmartWood Program , for example , has been culled from operations that seek to minimize their environmental impact and incorporate sustained-yield planning . There are also a small but growing number of manufacturers that produce minimal-impact office furniture . Among them is Studio eg , which produces a line of formaldehyde-free modular office pieces . Surfaces are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table legs from recycled cardboard , and cubicle dividers from 100 percent recycled newsprint . Clean Carpets An even bigger drag on indoor air quality is carpeting . Newly-laid synthetic carpeting-as well as its backing , padding and adhesives-can " outgas " into office air a slew of chemicals ( including formaldehyde ) which are believed to play a role in " sick building syndrome , " a condition in which chemical contamination and poor ventilation cause workers to become ill . Bentley Mills is one of a handful of manufacturers that offer " low emission " synthetic carpets . Even easier on your lungs are carpets made from natural fibers , like cotton or wool . The wool carpets manufactured by Naturlich are woven from allnatural fibers and offgas no formaldehyde . Its Nature 's Carpet line also contains no mothproofing or dyes . The green office is also one where lights are clicked off when they 're not needed . But do n't worry if you forget : occupancy sensors can remember for you .

And you can save even more energy by installing compact fluorescent bulbs , which not only use less electricity but last longer , and pay for themselves with a year 's use . Two resources that can help you create the ultimate green work space are The Smart Office , a comprehensive guide by A.K. Townsend ; and the GreenLine catalog , a source for everything from ecofriendly copy paper to message pads . And to keep track of it all , there 's the Daily Plan-it , a day planner with a recycled soda bottle fabric cover , printed on recycled paper with soy-based inks . <p>
