Section : MARKETING Even a lowly columnist can get in on the multibillion-dollar market research game <p> When I first met Nancy Pullen , the president of P.S.L. Marketing Resources , she was wearing a chambray shirt emblazoned with a Birds Eye frozen foods logo  --  I knew I had come to the right place . Clearly , this was a person who lived and breathed brands , a person who could help me in my quest to turn Your Ad Here into a trusted infotainment resource that would resonate deeply with Mother Jones readers . <p> " So you read my last piece ? " I asked as we sat down to talk in P.S.L. 's conference room . <p> " I did , " she replied cheerfully . " The one where all the publicists kept telling you your column was n't newsworthy . " <p> " Yeah , that one . Which is why I 'm here , basically . Because if that 's what the publicists think  --  " <p> " Then what do your readers think ? " she asked , finishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to find out if what you 're offering is a viable product . " <p> In the good old day 's , market research was the province of advertising agencies and detergent manufacturers ; magazine columnists , with occasional interference from their editors , were presumed to exercise sole authority over their columns . Back then , positioning " creative " work as a " product " that could be pretested and refined through market research would have no doubt riled purists . Now , however , it 's just as hard to obtain shelf space in the media world as it is in the supermarket . If you want to increase your chances for long-term survival , you do whatever you can to learn more about the audience you 're hoping to reach . Thus , Broadway producer Garth Drabinsky has used market research firms in his quest to deliver consistently satisfactory theater experiences , and best-selling author James Patterson ( the adman who wrote the Toys " R " Us jingle ) has relied upon feedback from test readers to fine-tune his thrillers . <p> The market research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a booming , multibillion-dollar industry . According to Advertising Age , the top 100 research firms in the U.S. recorded $4.2 billion in revenues in 1997 , an increase of 12.2 percent from 1996 . With an industry of such scope at my disposal , I 'm now embarrassed to disclose how I produced the first two items in my product line : I just turned on my computer and started typing . <p> While laziness and the overblown self-assurance typical of most writers were at least partially responsible for this course of action , for Pullen 's benefit I now chalked it up to my busy schedule and a relatively nonexistent budget . " You 're right , " Pullen agreed as I raised these issues . " Research can be expensive . But not as expensive as bringing a product to market that no one actually wants . " <p> " So when you 're doing a consulting project for Disney or Hewlett-Packard , " I said , naming a couple of P.S.L. 's clients , " and you end up doing quantitative research , like telephone interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much does something like that actually cost ? " <p> " It really varies , " Pullen said . " Basically anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000 . " <p> " And focus groups ? They 'd be less expensive ? " <p> " We often do what we call ' mini ' focus groups , " Pullen replied . " A focus group usually has eight to 12 participants , but with a mini-group , you 've only got four or five . For any typical project , we might run four to five of these mini-groups . <p> Pullen also said P.S.L. pays participants anywhere from $50 to $150 . Calculating the expense of such a project , I tried a compromise : " Maybe we could do two mini-groups , " I suggested . " And $50 a person ought to be enough , do n't you think ? I mean , a lot of people are happy to criticize this column for free . " <p> " Getting people is n't the problem , " Pullen explained . " What you need to do is get the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a potential interest in your column , then your research is meaningless . What you want to do is get individuals who fit an educated guess of the target customer , who are articulate but are n't research experts . " <p> At this point , Pullen began delineating all-too-common focus group species : the know-it-all types who monopolize discussions and sound more like auditioning consultants than candid consumers ; the me-too opinion recyclers who mostly nod their heads a lot and second everything that other participants have already said ; and the focus groupies who attend sessions primarily for the social opportunities and the free snacks . <p> Interaction among participants and the influence of the moderator were factors to consider as well . " For example , if you 're talking about toilet paper , you learn not to have men and women in the same group , " Pullen explained . " It 's one of the things they wo n't talk about in front of each other . And if your group 's composed of 15-year-old girls , then make sure the moderator 's not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group wherein the participants paid more attention to the moderator 's " amazing eyes " than to the product they 'd been recruited to evaluate . <p> I also spoke several times with Pullen 's colleague , Laura Klapper , as she developed our recruitment " screener "  --  a list of questions and qualifications designed to weed out all but the most ideal candidates . For the group composed of Mother Jones subscribers , we wanted articulate individuals 35 and older who had read at least one of my columns . For the group composed of nonsubscribers , we wanted individuals 20 to 34 who subscribed to at least one magazine from a list that included Time , The New Republic , Harper 's Magazine , and several others , and who would at least consider reading Mother Jones . In addition , we excluded anyone who identified him- or herself as a Republican ; even though Your Ad Here is a relatively nonpartisan endeavor , we felt Republicans were more likely to be biased against Mother Jones , and that bias might carry over toward my column regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nonsubscribers , several Mother Jones interns were enlisted to recruit the subscribers . At first , the responses were less than encouraging . " I probably skipped it , " said one subscriber , when asked if she had ever read Your Ad Here . " These columns are not sticking out to me , " another replied . " You people are calling me too much ! " complained an overly telemarketed reader who 'd recently been hit up by the Mother Jones Investigative Fund . " If I get one more call , I 'm going to cancel my donation . " <p> One politely unyielding subscriber demurred , " The more you know about us , the worse off we are , dear . " There were also a few exotic dodges , such as the man who said he was too busy having sex ( no amount of research could explain what motivated him to pick up the phone in the first place ) . <p> With the focus group meetings looming just days away and only two participants signed up , we changed our tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them about the $50 honorarium , we told them about the money first . Suddenly , there was much more interest . Unfortunately , we were still having trouble finding subscribers who had actually read either of my first two columns , so we also relaxed that qualification . <p> Eventually , we managed to recruit seven subscribers and six nonsubscribers . And thus , on a Saturday morning in November , I went to the San Francisco facilities of Fleischman Field Research , where our two sessions were scheduled to take place in the Herb Caen Room , an efficient-looking , gray-carpeted space equipped with a long table , half a dozen chairs , and a wall-sized one-way mirror . <p> As I waited in the observation room behind the mirror , I studied the discussion guide Klapper would use to lead the group . " How did you rate the column ? " it asked . " What other changes , if any , would you like to see within the column ? " <p> But was I really ready to listen ? While focus groups can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than their own convictions , it also takes a certain bravery to offer up one 's work to a roomful of candid strangers and then remain within earshot of their conversations about it . Was it too late to turn back ? Alas , as I looked up from the discussion guide , I saw through the one-way mirror that the participants were entering the room . ... <p> Focus group highlights  --  and a new and improved column ?  --  in the newt issue . <p> By G.
