They seem to be part of the subways of New York City , walking meekly up and down the cars , handing out pens and key chains , along with frayed business-size cards that read I AM DEAF . Then they scurry back , ricocheting from post to post as they silently gather up their cards and wares , their cocked heads appealing for riders to buy the pitiful $1 trinkets . Most people ignore them . <P> However , four of these vendors ventured nervously into a police precinct at 4 a.m. on July 19 with a three-page letter that hinted at the silent netherworld they inhabited . Following them to two houses in Queens , police discovered 57 Mexicans , most of them deaf-mute illegal immigrants , crammed into two top-floor apartments . Alternately signing and writing , the shabbily dressed immigrants  --  among them pregnant women and children and infants  --  described themselves as exploited laborers held captive by the Paolettis , a Mexican family whose deaf members had enticed them with promises of a sweeter life , then confiscated their identity documents to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual abuse , the vendors claimed , they were forced to sell trinkets up to 18 hours a day , seven days a week , for roughly 74cents an hour . Of the $400 each worker was paid monthly , $200 was siphoned off for rent . In a locked room off the areas scattered with mattresses , sleeping bags and bunk beds , police found evidence of their hard labor : $35,000 in cash , $10,000 of it in $1 bills .

Three young women told doctors that they had been " touched in their private parts on a daily basis for almost two years . " Several spoke of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens apartments if they returned home from a day 's work with less than $100 . <P> The neighbors described a nightly horror show of barefoot women , clad only in nightgowns , fleeing from the houses with men in pursuit ; of babies crying , their squalls unattended ; of walls vibrating from slamming doors and pounding fists . George Friebolin , an advocate for the deaf at the Lexington Vocational Services in Queens , who knew some of the immigrants from a Bible-study program , said one man told him last week that his son had been kidnapped . " They told him that the baby was placed in a convent or a church in Manhattan , " says Friebolin . " He says he 's been searching for the child since . "
