In America , big has always been beautiful . As a nation we revel in being a superpower and having the biggest economy . We idolize 390-pound NFL linemen with nicknames like the Refrigerator and award blue ribbons for humongous zucchini . But these days something very un-American is happening in the corporate world : Big is becoming bad . The villain here is not size per se , but rather the burden that size imposes on the job of managing . According to much new thinking , big means complex , and complexity results in inefficiencies , bureaucratic bloat , and strangled communications . The parallel , increasingly invoked , is to what was the Soviet Union . In the former evil empire , a huge , highly centralized , run-from-the-top system came crashing down under its own weight . Now , hoping to avoid the fate of the old Soviet Union , corporate America is undergoing its own perestroika , splitting its assets into smaller , more efficient , more independent businesses , with a new relation to the organizational center what used to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about another large corporation decentralizing or getting smaller . Last November , IBM , a.k.a . Big Blue , announced it would begin reorganizing itself into more autonomous operating units . GM is eliminating 74,000 jobs , closing 21 factories , and pinning its hopes on independent projects like Saturn . In the course of the 1980s , Fortune 500 companies shed some 3.5 million jobs . Says Peter Drucker , the grand vizier of management consultants : " The Fortune 500 is over . " Drucker does n't expect big corporations to cease to exist . But he thinks they will slowly and painfully transform themselves into a new kind of creature that combines the clout of a giant with the nimbleness of an entrepreneurial elf . Says Ralph Larsen , CEO of health care colossus Johnson &; Johnson : " In the 1980s there was a great financial restructuring . In the 1990s we 're going to see a different kind . We 're about to embark on a philosophical restructuring , where corporations make their businesses more decentralized and give people the freedom to act without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the emerging wisdom , will consist of tens or hundreds of small , highly decentralized units , each one with a laserlike focus on a market or a customer . Says Charles H. Ferguson , an MIT researcher and management consultant : " Ideally you want a big organization that thinks flexibly . " Call it the **25;113;TOOLONG hybrid . Or what political economist Robert B. Reich at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government refers to as an " enterprise web . " This new entity combines the best that big corporations have to offer  --  access to large amounts of capital , the wherewithal to make substantial investments in basic research , and the ability to attract and keep the most talented manager  --  with the best features of a small business , namely focus , flexibility , and speed . Today a handful of organizations like Johnson &; Johnson , Microsoft , Siemens , Clayton Dubilier &; Rice , and Hanson Industries provide a glimpse of what this big/small hybrid may look like . In these outfits , headquarters does not itself " manage " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual businesses . Johnson &; Johnson , for instance , No. 34 on the Fortune 500 with revenues of $12.4 billion , has a small corporate staff  --  just 1.5% of its 82,700 employees work at headquarters . It oversees a network of 166 highly decentralized businesses , each focusing on health care and ranging in size from $100,000 in sales a year to $1 billion . Hanson Industries has 120 people in its U.S. head office and manages units with a combined $8 billion in revenues . Clayton Dubilier &; Rice , a New York City management buyout firm , has only 11 people on top looking out for eight businesses with some $6 billion in annual revenues . Both Hanson and CD &R; own companies in many different industries , but unlike traditional conglomerates , they let each act independently unburdened by directives from the top or attempts at synergy . The point is to act like a small or medium-size business , not to fission a big company into a galaxy of little ones . Corporate America is not about to devolve into a nation of mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that employ 100 or fewer people , represent 98% of America 's eight million businesses , but on some fronts will never be able to compete against foreign giants like NEC and Daimler-Benz . It is n't just that small companies are n't as profitable as big ones ( see graph ) ; they also lack the financial clout to make big bets on basic technology . ( Graph omitted ) What small firm could afford the kind of long-term support AT &T; gave to the three Bell Labs scientists who invented the transistor ? Moreover , as employers large companies have certain advantages . Small companies do produce many of the economy 's new jobs , but they also suffer a much higher casualty rate than the giants , so many of those jobs do n't last very long . They do n't pay as well either . Positions at small companies pay 35% less on average than comparable jobs at big companies and offer fewer accompanying benefits . The U.S. needs its big guys , but many of today 's behemoths just are n't performing as well as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing . Many Management experts see a vastly altered world economy in which the traditional attributes of size  --  economies of scale and stability  --  are not nearly as crucial to competing in fast-changing markets as flexibility and agility . In many businesses , economies of scale , once a principal reason for getting big , are no longer an effective competitive weapon . The world of mass production is giving way to flexible manufacturing systems making smaller batches of a wider array of products . Carmakers today offer about 600 different models in the U.S. market alone . Sony produces some 44 variations of the Walkman . The day is over when a big company can thrive by producing more of a standard product at a lower cost than its rivals . Today 's need for speed and flexibility also means that conglomerates , those huge , centrally controlled collections of diverse businesses , are becoming as out of place , Raymond Chandler might have said , as spats at an Iowa picnic . It turns out that the complexity and costs associated with managing these outfits usually far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study by the Hay Group found that , on average , conglomerates have been nearly 30% less profitable than more focused companies . Compare the fates of WalMart and Sears Roebuck . WalMart , the giant Arkansas-based chain , has never veered from what it does best , discount retailing ; today it 's one of the nation 's fastest-growing and most profitable big corporations . In the past decade Sears , another giant retailer , bought Coldwell Banker , a real estate firm , and Dean Witter , a brokerage house . Over those ten years , Sears ' average annual total return to investors has been 10.9% , vs. 42.2% for Wal-Mart . Realizing that the supposed benefits of conglomeration besides synergy , principally the hope that the different cycles of the different businesses will offset one another  --  are proving elusive , American corporations are getting focused at a faster pace than ever . One sign : The average number of corporate spinoffs nearly quadrupled in the 1980s compared with the 1960s and 1970s . According to Frank Lichtenberg , an economics professor at Columbia business school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly diversified  --  operating in more than 20 businesses  --  declined 37% , while the number of corporations operating in only one industry increased 54% . If the traditional behemoth seems inclined to fall apart , what sort of new beast is slouching toward Bethlehem to be born in its place ? Michael Roever , a senior director in the Munich office of McKinsey &; Co. and author of three new reports on corporate complexity , says that tomorrow 's big corporations will have at least three things in common : a small headquarters , little vertical integration , and a focus on key products and customers . Roever points to a McKinsey study of Germany 's thriving machine-tool industry , which found that the best-performing companies shared these characteristics . A small corporate staff enabled them to move swiftly , while the minimal vertical integration saved them time and money . Anything that was n't essential to the business was done cheaper and faster by outside suppliers . To achieve the optimal level of vertical integration , a company must focus on its  --  stand by for that trendy new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , this idea is a reworking for corporations of the theory of comparative advantage of nations . If marketing is what gives a company its competitive advantage in an industry , then it should build up its marketing muscle and employ outside suppliers and service firms to do everything else . Nike and Reebok , the athletic shoe makers , are good examples of companies that have avoided the excess cost and complexity of vertical integration . Both focus on design and marketing , which they do well . Reebok 's innovative design for the Pump sneaker made it a runaway best-seller . Nike 's Air Jordan television ads had kids flocking to the stores . But both companies lack a competitive advantage in manufacturing , so they farm out most of the production of their shoes to efficient , low-cost factories in the Far East . According to the new thinking , any kind of work to which a company ca n't bring a special set of skills should be spun off , outsourced , or eliminated . Thus AT &T,; GE , IBM , and Shell Oil are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , billing , payroll , and other services . What 's left , whether it 's a $100 million corporation or a $100 billion corporation , is the ideal size . The small headquarters aspect of Roever 's model company is even more important . The key to success in the organization of tomorrow is a corporate staff capable of allocating capital and recruiting talent but small and restrained enough to allow each component business to act like an independent entrepreneurial outfit . This is how companies like J &J,; Siemens , Microsoft , CD &R,; and Hanson Industries operate today . The Kennedy school 's Robert Reich prophesies that in terms of capital allocation tomorrow 's headquarters will play a role similar to that of Japan 's keiretsu banks , like Sumitomo , and Germany 's so-called universal banks , like Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank . A high level of cross ownership between each of these banks and the operating companies it finances allows the lenders to be privy to detailed sales , earnings , and other operating numbers . With the insight thereby gained on changing markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in theory , anyway  --  apportion capital among various businesses effectively . Like one of these bankers , an American executive running a focused hybrid should know his industry thoroughly and therefore be able to move capital quickly from one business to another when appropriate . Moreover , each small business that is part of the larger organization will enjoy the advantages size brings to raising capital : Because it 's easier for big companies to raise a large amount , they can take bigger risks investing it . In 1983 , for instance , some managers at Johnson &; Johnson 's Vistakon division wanted to start a new business making and selling disposable contact lenses . The company funded them to the tune of hundreds of millions over the next seven years , resulting in a business that today enjoys sales of nearly $250 million a year . CEO Ralph Larsen argues that few venture capital firms would have sunk such a large sum of money into a technology that at the time was considered little more than a fool 's dream . " We were willing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we had lost the bet , as a large company we would have barely felt the hit . " Playing central banker involves more than just allocating capital . It also means requiring that absolutely everyone in the organization focus on the cost of capital and the necessity to generate a substantial return on funds invested . This discipline , proponents of the new structure contend , is almost unheard of in the conventional big company . By enforcing it , Clayton Dubilier &; Rice , the management-buyout firm that owns businesses ranging from the Scotts Co. , the lawn care people , to Lexmark International , formerly IBM 's desktop printer and typewriter business , has been able over the past 12 years to provide its investors with 108% average annual return on investment . By insisting that everyone pay attention to the cost of capital , CD &R; gets each of its operating managers to act like an entrepreneur , counting every penny . Nothing is spent unless it promises a satisfactory return . Says Paul Curlander , an ex-IBM manager now in charge of Lexmark 's printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest budget you could every year and then make sure every last cent got spent . Otherwise , your budget would be cut the next year . At Lexmark I get paid more if my business is more profitable . So if I come in 25% under budget , I 'm delighted . " The second most important job for headquarters in tomorrow 's big corporation is putting the right executives in the right jobs . Here it will make use of advantages in attracting good people , including the principle that talent draws other talent to it , even  --  and maybe increasingly  --  on a global basis . A German engineer , say , might jump at the opportunity to join an international operation where he could work with , and learn from , other worldclass engineers . Big companies also have more bench depth . Lord Gordon White , the cosmopolite who runs Hanson Industries , a collection of diverse businesses ranging from Peabody Coal to Jacuzzi whirlpools , says that when he needs to replace the operating head of one of his companies , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbent 's No. 2 's or No. 3 's . Says White : " Judgment comes in here . Ask the guy who 's been playing second fiddle about his ambition , and you 're either impressed by it or not . " The final responsibility of the people at headquarters is often the hardest : They must truly let go of control and be willing to allow the business units to operate independently . This task is almost constitutionally impossible for old-style managers whose egos are tied to running big divisions from big offices with big staffs . It helps to create a new ideal . In organizations like CD &R,; the idea is to make the head of each operating unit truly feel that he is running his own show . Says Joseph L. Rice , CD &R's; president : " We try to create environments where entrepreneurs can be successful . " Managers in charge of the decentralized businesses have the decisionmaking and spending power of a CEO . Adds Rice 's colleague B. Charles Ames : " There 's no sitting around and waiting for an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an idea of how different life is when you are no longer in thrall to a huge , centralized , controlled organization like IBM , consider in more detail the case of Lexmark . About a year ago , when CD &R; bought IBM 's desktop computer printer and typewriter business for $1.5 billion , it appointed as CEO Marvin Mann , a 32-year IBM veteran . Mann 's job was to make Lexmark entrepreneurial . This represented quite a challenge . Over the years IBM had gotten so big that its typewriter and printer business , with a mere $2 billion in revenue , had suffered from neglect . IBM 's sales force understandably pushed expensive mainframe systems , on which they received a higher commission , and peddled typewriters only as an afterthought . The printer business in Europe was so hopelessly enmeshed with the company 's other operations there that U.S. managers could only estimate how well  --  or badly  --  the foreign business was doing . After taking over , Mann sliced 2,000 people  --  nearly half the old business 's total  --  from Lexmark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He divided the company into four entrepreneurial units  --  printers , keyboards , typewriters , and printer supplies  --  each with its own profit-and-loss statement . He eliminated most meetings and formal presentations  --  a hallmark of IBM , where managers show up with armloads of transparencies so they are ready to answer any question , no matter how far-fetched . Then Mann built up a sales force of 900 people to focus solely on printers , typewriters , and office supplies . Says he : " At IBM it used to be , " I 'm such a small piece of a large organization , it does n't matter what I do . ' Now people are working in units where they feel they can make a difference . " In 1989 , to keep its operating units entrepreneurial and freewheeling , Siemens , the $45-billion-a-year German electronics corporation , created within the parent organization 16 minicorporations with annual revenues ranging from $500 million to $8 billion , each with its own CEO and board of directors . The CEO has the final say on most decisions but must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Albert Moser , who runs Siemens 's $4.5-billion-a-year U.S. operations : " We split up the big battleship into a flotilla of effectively run small ships under one admiralty . " As part of its restructuring , Siemens created a new organization for its train and subway equipment business , with a CEO and a board consisting of three executives , one each from marketing , manufacturing , and finance . Parts of the new unit had been scattered throughout Siemens . The people who made railway switches , for instace , did not work in the same division as those who made electrical systems for trains . Once merged into a single group with one clear set of customers , the rail business flourished . From 1988 to the present , sales rose 80% , an astounding performance in a mature industry . One reason big/small hybrids can give their operating units so much freedom is that there are sophisticated computer systems back at headquarters to keep continuous , careful track of financial data . J &J's; Larsen , for example , one of the few CEOs besides Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a PC to keep on top of his separate businesses . At the flick of a button , sales , profits , and cash flow for any one of them flash on his screen . Since the data are automatically entered into the system each time a unit reports a sale or spends some money , managers are spared the time-consuming job of preparing monthly financial reports . If , and only if , Larsen sees a potential problem will he pick up the phone and call the manager of the unit to see if he can help . Says he : " We can keep our finger on the pulse of the corporation without burdening our companies with reporting or requests for information . " At Microsoft , the Redmond , Washington , software company , CEO Bill Gates uses a sophisticated electronic mail system to eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks , where layers of people wait to get answers . Every day he receives hundreds of E-mail messages from just about anyone in the corporation . Like a switchboard operator , he responds to all of them  --  usually typing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some he answers himself , others he shoots over to whoever else in the organization can handle it better . With E-mail people can ignore the chain of command and go directly to the boss . Says Gates : " In bureaucracies , it 's not clear how the answers are arrived at . Smart people lose respect for those making the decisions , and lose energy and do n't want to get involved . That 's where size hurts . " Is there a perfect size for each business unit ? This will vary greatly by industry , of course , but Gates argues that after a group gets beyond 200 people , it becomes very hard to manage . You ca n't know everyone 's name , communications suffer , and people start to feel that they do n't make a difference . In a recent reorganization , Gates accordingly broke the software development business from five units into 15 , each one no larger than 200 people . But he still worries that despite the reorganization Microsoft may lose its small-company feel . Says he : " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , and when you go to our Christmas party , you have a hard time finding people . We 'll just have to keep breaking ourselves into smaller parts . " As big companies subdivide , the question arises as to which functions , if any , should remain centralized . Warns Hanson Industries ' Lord White : " Bureaucracy grows faster than anything , and it does n't even need water . " Still , there are a few business activities that sometimes should be centralized either because the company can benefit from economies of scale  --  purchasing , for example  --  or because the financial investment needed is so great that no one division can afford it . Advises Johnson &; Johnson 's Larsen : " The key to shared services is to keep them closely tied to the operating company so you do n't create corporate staff . " Accordingly , J &J; has no centralized research facility , but spreads some 56 labs among its 166 businesses . The idea is that only businesses in closely related fields should share R &D.; For its part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while basic research is centralized . But the scientists from the central lab must be able to sell at least some of their basic research to operating managers  --  this keeps the scientists from getting too far removed from the daily business . Some companies , like Bell Atlantic and Lexmark , get around the inefficiencies and cost of huge centralized R &D; by forming joint ventures . Lexmark has an agreement to buy research from the labs of its old parent , IBM . Bell Atlantic has formed Bellcore with its six Baby Bell siblings to develop intelligent telephone networks . Says Bell Atlantic CEO Ray Smith : " This is expensive and complex technology . Any one of the seven Baby Bells would have had a tremendously tough time undertaking the task on its own . " Efficient as the big/small organization may be , employees do pay a price . Middle managers will continue to lose their jobs in a decentralized corporation  --  or be terrified of losing them . Those who survive will be starkly exposed to competitive pressures because they will be working in smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Conference Board 's chief economist : " Maybe we 're getting too Darwinian . " Survival of the fittest has its compensations , though , beyond merely surviving in a fiercer competitive environment . The work can be more satisfying because a corporation focused on its core business can do away with a lot of the politicking , meetings , and red tape common in huge , centrally controlled organizations . Workers in the new big/small outfits are also likely to make more money . If business units are going to be entrepreneurial , they will have to offer entrepreneurial rewards . Lexmark has granted stock options , representing a hefty 15% of the company 's total equity , to all its employees . About 70% of the people at Microsoft are eligible for stock options . A point to bear in mind as America 's big corporations reconstitute themselves for the global battles of the 1990s is that organizations have life cycles , just like people . In their early years , they 're small , fast-growing , and close to their customers . As they age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of touch with their markets . Tomorrow 's competitors must figure out how to be big and entrepreneurial . As CD &R's; Chuck Ames puts it , " Small is not better ; focused is better . " <p>
