FROM KILROY KILROY <p> His life begins in a blinding flash , and for this reason it has lasted as long as the universe ... <p> They find him drifting out beyond the reef . Burned to unconsciousness , paralyzed , and tangled in his parachute , which buoys him up with air pockets in its glasslike , yellow fabric that shines in the ocean . <p> Everywhere around them dead fish are floating to the surface . They are strangely pale , as if their colors have been scalded out . <p> They grab hold of one of the lines and haul him in . His charred clothing slides off him . A leather pouch comes off and disintegrates . A little row of tags with his signature , some photographs , and some paper money dance away on the waves . <p> Gingerly , they lift him free of the strap and up into the boat . The burns blaze on his naked body . They peel the last bits of fabric from his skin and remove the lumps of a neck chain that has sliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom death has kissed so passionately , and breathe the breath of life back into his lungs . They remove a plank from the bottom of the boat , and lay him in the pool so the water can wash over the eruptions on his body . Meanwhile , the parachute bobs away in a fading yellow light , and the sun moves into the sea . <p> Tini , Moana , and Aluea set their course for land . The naked man is their own age and looks as if he is still drifting . Sounds come from his lips , or a language they do n't understand . They sit silently , feeling a life-saving tenderness surge in over the creature with the melted wings . He is disfigured by a gash in his forehead , and one side of his face is swollen . One eye the size of a ball , the slit stretched tightly across it like stitching . The other eye is untouched and white in its almond-shaped arch  --  like the islands of whole flesh visible among the injuries . <p> Tini disentangles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to take the sail down from the boom . He is careful so the yawl wo n't start to rock . Moana is squatting over the guest from the sea . His careful hands do n't even touch the air above the burned places . Aluea starts the outboard motor that came to the island with the Allied Forces , and his conjurer ' s face beams with a kind of feigned astonishment that this new trick has worked one more time . <p> The wind is calm , and they rise and fall on the shining stripe of the sea swell . The boat slices ahead along the atoll 's outermost palm border , and the aft motor backfires with puffs of smoke . In on the headland the church shines , flecks of red in its walls . <p> When they move through the reef passage , the yawl twists in the strong current . The coral formations jut up from the bottom 's clear mirrored surface together with darker shimmers of fish . A school flashes away from the boat in one big shadow . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their motor rises abruptly over the breakers . Moana has leaned forward protectively-the half-drowned , half-burned man appears to be without pain and unaffected by the motion of the boat . <p> The village , with its mix of palm-thatched huts and houses of pastel-colored plywood , faces the lagoon . The water tanks have been spackled with fresh mortar and look like new . Their reinforcing rods protrude from the tops , bristling against the sky with the cut of bird ' s feet . A concrete skid has been poured out into the water to help haul the boats to land . They are about to lay the rails for a slip wagon that will take medium-sized ships . Large breakwater stones stretch out to a jetty topped with cement . But the construction is standing idle . Everything looks as if it has just been abandoned . The base with its empty crew 's barracks stands beneath the swaying coconut palms . A window bangs on its half-hinge , sending reflected flashes out across the lagoon . <p> The American soldiers have moved on somewhere else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon , now and then sending a volcanolike rumbling in over the island . Down on the south end , the landing strip for their bombers extends to the outer reef where waves slam across the asphalt in a foaming wall , covering it with scurrying red crustaceans . <p> They lift him over into the sail and up onto land . <p> Fires have been lit in oil barrels and cracker tins in front of the houses , and twisted coconut husks smolder beneath grates and pots black with soot . The evening is blue in the shadows , and swarms of mosquitoes circle around the smoke , billowing out into the breeze . While Tini divides the catch , Moana and Aluea , using two bamboo laths , transform the sail into <p> stretcher . They cover the burned man with palm leaves sprinkled with gasoline to keep the flies from his wounds . <p> The children peer down and then run off along the sand paths between Omoka 's houses with news about the new arrival . A veritable procession of men and women accompanies the stretcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrying . The procession winds its way slowly along the path to Mama Hina 's house . <p> They put the stretcher down on the porch . They gently lower him onto a sleeping mat , and several women squat and begin to wave fans over the sailcloth , uttering vague words . <p> There he lies , surrounded by murmurs , the coolness of tiara flowers on his forehead , waiting  --  without knowing it  --  for Mama Hina 's skilled hands . <p> When she comes out , the voices sink to the ground around her , and she inspects the wounded man . When Aluea starts to tell about it , she stops him with a wave of her hand ; she already knows . She shakes her head a number of times . Her face is darkly furrowed . A collective slump sets into the shoulders of the assembled people as feet scrape and men clear their throats . <p> Moana 's eyes grow bright . Before he bows his head , he catches his mother 's gaze , and the expression on Mama Hina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papala takes their sons  --  of whom Moana is the youngest  --  and a couple of men out with him to cut palm grass . Others make small fires of coconut shreds to keep the insects away . At Mama Hina 's bidding , Aluea and Tangi put themselves at the head of a delegation that walks all the way out to the abandoned base . They return with a white enamel bathtub that they have lifted off its drainpipe . In the meantime the stalks have been beaten to a knotted green pulp , and the women have begun to sing . The bathtub is filled with rainwater from jerry cans warmed up during the course of the day , and Mama Hina softens the plant pulp in the water . <p> The same thing happens that has happened before when she has set broken limbs and backs in place : a coolness spreads in the water , a coolness that is not part of the island . Mama Hina 's little miracle of coolness that cures fever and heals wounds and fractures . This ice that Mama Hina produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , air , and water . The coolness lasts through the day 's long hours of sunshine and into the mild evening . Many of them have to go over and feel it , the chill extending several fingerbreadths above the surface . No one dares to dip into the liquid that radiates cold up to them . <p> When  --  at a sign from Mama Hina  --  they lift him over into the bath , the gleam on Moana ' s face rivals that of the moon coming up over the trees . But when the body , naked and riddled with craters , rises up on a forest of hands and passes through the beam of light , the collective song dies for one terrified moment , and silence falls . <p> Mama Lei holds a piece of cloth up next to her cheek . She is streaked with tears and rocking on her heels . Then she starts singing again with a power that sweeps everyone along with it . The men join in the song with choral voices and rhythmic shouts . These are prayers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The stranger has stopped moving his lips . He is lying with the back of his head tilting sideways in Moana 's hands . His half-face has slipped deep into the furrows of sleep , and it is impossible to tell whether he is breathing . Only Mama Hina knows . She scoops water onto his head with her fingers , cupping one hand over his blackened eye and scooping with the other . Probing his paralyzed limbs with the outermost points of her fingertips , pulling and pushing so abruptly that a kind of jolt goes through the assembly . <p> She returns to the same places in wide circles . The odd angles in his arms and legs are smoothed out . She grips the base of the spine itself , and his body makes a loud snapping sound when she straightens out his torso . She touches his wounds only with water that she scoops and fans on him . Her eyes have narrowed sharply , slanting with the power she collects from her surroundings . <p> At last , when half the night has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief passes through those who are still awake . Their song has long since fallen silent , and the moon and its radiance are down beneath the waters of the lagoon again . <p> Only then does Moana drift off to sleep  --  pressed to his new friend . His hands are still under the back of the stranger 's head ; his own head has fallen down onto the edge of the bathtub . Mama Hina has finished her first treatment and has decided that the patient should continue to lie in the sustained coolness of the liquid . He is returning ever closer to life but is still a long way from the land of the living . She sends the last of her neighbors home , gives Mama Lei a hug , and tells her daughter Tapairo to keep watch before she finally has a smoke in the dark and lies down next to Papala . <p> In the time that follows Mama Hina continues her treatment every day until her hands are numb with cold and her fingers ache from the rheumatism that she cures so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been changed once , and his improvement is obvious . He no longer spends the entire day in the bathtub , only the hours when his treatment is taking place . His wounds have progressed through the entire spectrum to a red that is fading by the day . The swelling in his face has completely subsided ; what remains is a deep wound across the bridge of his nose and a crusted arch where his eyebrow was burned off . <p> Moana and Tapairo pour thick coconut milk and fish soup into him , alternating with mashed papaya and taro root . Mama Hina adds herbs to it . He has been conscious in brief rushes , calling out a name he will no longer remember when he emerges from the night . <p> Long before he opened his eyes , his eyelids quivered , and he talked uneasily and turned over a number of times . Everywhere in the room , the flash he has emerged from is etched with white flames . Figures with foglike contours or surrounded by halos of rainbow colors glide in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths . Far off in the distance , a wall is undulating with shifting rays of light . They are dazzling incisions in his brain . Waves that desire to get out through his forehead and find the darkness but that are held back by a vault of bone behind which everything is pounding . Convulsions that beat their pulse against his cranial seam . At the very top his head is soft , and the flesh throbs like that of a newborn . The pain behind his eyes is nothing compared to what he feels when he tries to recognize shapes around him-because things no longer have names , and words are an endless music evading their own meaning with melodic sounds . He is a blank slate . <p> His memory begins and ends in the flash he had closed his eyes to . It is without time or expanse  --  like the Creation  --  absurdly and blissfully , he enters a world where nothing has ever happened . He blinks his eyes , and the bliss does not diminish the pain with which he reaches out for things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream in between . He looks at everything for such a long time that it loses its shape and merges with everything else . It is a fluid world , and fluids are all that he gets when they bend in over him with spoons and bowls . <p> And yet he remembers everything . Like someone who has lived before . He seeks their reassuring hands and holds onto them for a long time . He calls to them with sounds that resemble those of an animal in distress . He radiates out to meet them because they come from the depths behind him . He is like any other baby . They give him food and keep him clean . <p> Moana and Tapairo are the first ones to etch themselves into his new life . <p> Tapairo is the heart-shaped form that encompasses everything within itself . Arches and lines that meet gently in the flesh . She is blue like the night with sudden sparkles . She is there emitting the most soothing waves that he has known . His face relaxes if she so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her skin , and he glides through the starry galaxies of sleep with her image on his lips . <p> His long awakening progresses in this way for days , imperceptibly watched over by Mama Hina , who holds her grown children in check and determines the course of the struggle . With brief snorts , she receives their reports about progress or relapses , turns her back to them , lights one of her hand-rolled cigarettes . With a wave of her hand behind her , she sends them out of the room before she resumes her work of weaving hats and mats from long pandanus leaves , untangling the fibers with a special comb . <p> One day he sits up on the mat without help and slowly directs his ravenous gaze at a shuttered opening through which the morning light is playing . He puts his hands to his throat again and again , and a protracted astonishment glides over him . For a moment there is an invisible tag between his fingers , and his lips try to form a word . Then his whole hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his eyes and mouth are again emptied of any expression . But in one brief glimmer of light , he resembled a man , older than time , and Tapairo remained standing in the shaded frame of the doorway , transformed into a pillar of thoughts she had not had before . <p> With a hitherto unfamiliar aloofness about her , she puts down the boiled fish  --  without crossing the threshold . Thrusts the boat of leaves on which it is lying a short distance into the room and turns around . Her hair is blue in the sunshine , the flowers rock on her hips , and her body sways beneath her loosely tied clothing . <p> With each step away from him , her foot moves searchingly in the thin air . Her gait is composed of broken circles , first to one side , then to the other . She looks down at the ground and constantly forgets what she is doing . She has walked through the coconut grove all the way out to the ocean , stands with her ankles in the outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those rare mornings when the wind carries the waves away from the island , and the sea moves toward the horizon in long crests that roll up and down within each other . Tapairo continues to glisten for a long time after she has finally returned , with the shrieking of seabirds high above her and her hand wet from the labia that she has opened by herself for the first time . <p> From that day , he eats more solid food  --  cooked and raw . It settles in his limbs as returning strength . He is walking now , supported by walls and tables , still tottering and with steps that are much too large . He imitates the English words with which they address him , more of them day by day . He progresses by leaps and bounds . He has a starving child inside him , one that seizes everything with a large and inquisitive hand . He learns to peak by forming words as balls that he tosses away from himself again so that they bounce capriciously around among all the things they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casts its spell over him . He is clearly indifferent to what he is saying . He soon understands their elementary English and can answer them . He forms his words with some difficulty as if he already knows the language but speaks it with an accent that seems to come from another tongue , like theirs . If , on the other hand , they address him in Maori , he again goes blank . Even though he swallows the drawn out harmony and sweeping glottals of the sentences with his eyes , it is obvious that he does n't understand a thing . If they switch back to English , he joins ecstatically in the conversation ; but he answers all of their questions with the same questions . For a long time they do not understand his lack of a name . <p> There is one language : the language that he speaks inside himself , where he does not need to speak out loud to understand things . A language that has always been there and whose keys correspond so perfectly to everything lost that it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and which escapes from him only in his sleep and makes everyone who hears him believe that he is carrying on conversations with angels and demons . <p> Awake , he resembles an idiot child . When he is sleeping , on the other hand , he resembles an adult who has been close to more than was good for him . Spasms contort the mask beneath the eyebrows that have been burned off , and he shouts as he hurls his body around . Or he lies prostrate as an angel , speaking in complete sentences with the invisible people . No one among them has heard it before or is able to say where it comes from . <p> Moana , who shares his name with the ocean , has started taking him along to fish . At first he sits speechless watching their preparations . Then he flings himself out so that they have to haul him back on board . The more everyday experiences they give him , the more words they find in common  --  the more reality they can share . <p> And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . Moana swells with pride over his adopted brother , who is absolutely fearless and has to have each and every earthly pitfall pointed out to him . The man is in his element , like a fish in the water with the others , and the ocean soon gives back to him the full use of his limbs . <p> Moana is his underwater guide and opens up a world to him . The man without a memory is the one who prods the moray eel , with its phosphorescent spots and snake 's head , back into its hole . It strikes out at his limbs that are still white from his stay in bed and shine with an unnatural glow beneath the water . By hand signs , Moana directs him around the slow flutter of the sea anemone where the clown fish sits unmoved with its palette between the poisonous threads , shows him the stinger of the stone fish , which has to be teased out of its complete assimilation with its surroundings and will sting and kill the man who touches it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks , carrying bleeding fish that the others have speared . When one of the lurking gray sharks takes a close turn in toward him and snatches a fish off the line that he has hung around his hips , his fright compares exactly to that of a boy feeding hay to a horse with his hand , when the straws disappear with a slurp between teeth that are much too large . <p> With a grin , his face finds Moana 's worried face underwater where the sun forms long , flickering shafts of blue . Their hair rises beaded with water . Their eyes , big as teacups , stare out of the swimming goggles , and they turn somersaults with kicks of their rubber flippers , lead weights in their belts . Their glances send out coded messages which are without sound and render everyone speechless in a world of sheer flowing silence . <p> Here everything is new , and it glides with unimpeded clarity into his lenses , finding a place for itself in the empty halls that he hovers so lightly outside of . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh rise and fall . Plate coral forms a reflective bottom and takes on every possible shape in the glittering of purple and red and yellow light . Organisms withdraw like snails back into the living rock at the slightest touch , making him spout bubbles with joy . He nearly chokes the first time he sees a fish with a parrot 's beak , blue and green ; it swims away in such a fright that it defecates a whole cloud of the coral it has just gnawed off . <p> Afterwards , they dry off on the beach with the coral sand crunching beneath them . They have fish scales on them that contract on their skin and stick fast . Moana and his other new friends strip the fish with their teeth and give him the meat raw . They knock holes in coconuts and drink the newly fermented green ones ; they smash the dark ones where the endosperm has exploded to a heart as big as a hand , which they call uto and which has the taste of semen . He repeats everything they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rhyming vowels they do n't know in English , and he repeats the names like music . <p> They teach him how to tell the savage sharks from the ones that are merely curious . The grays are dangerous , Papela , and they draw out the name so that it will penetrate . They put tiger stripes on his experiences so that he can distinguish the impetuous ones from the gentle ones . Not until then can he romp freely among the black and white tips of the lagoon 's sharks , feeding them like dogs . Finally , they show him shark bites and scars on their hips , arms , and legs , so he will understand that this is real . They teach him the difference between seriousness and play in the new element that has given him a rebirth . <p> For a long time , he answers " Hano tato sisi ! " to everything , turning the words in his mouth like candy : " Let 's go out and fish ! " <p> Moana is like someone who has trained a tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the others as if their new playmate were his personal contribution to Creation . <p> They fish with hooks and lines and bamboo poles and sweep the bottom of the lagoon with seine nets made out of interwoven palm branches . Behind their boats they trawl spinning lures made out of carved mother-of-pearl . For underwater hunting , they use handheld spears that the young men began to equip with slings of powerful elastic when rubber arrived on the island . <p> In the water they seem to have been released from the necessity of air . They go straight down to a depth of several fathoms with a weight in one hand and a net in the other to gather pearl oysters . <p> They are able to conjure up fish everywhere  --  with their bare hands if necessary  --  from tidal pools and inland lakes . They catch lobsters on the reef at ebb tide by planting one foot with lightning speed on the backward scurrying shells . They catch them in the glare of battery-powered lanterns , or better yet the powerful hissing oil lamps that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the darkness . <p> They catch coconut crabs among the palm trees and make a special treat of the large claws and the contents of the stomachs . He is their enraptured spectator everywhere , ready to clap his hands at each new trick . To an increasing degree , he becomes their assistant and is able to make himself useful in his new life . <p> In the weeks that follow he becomes an adult in the men 's world but remains a child in the women 's . Tapairo puts red hibiscus blossoms behind his ear She teaches him to tie his loin cloth in the men 's fashion and rubs his body , which is now tanned brown like theirs , with coconut oil . Only his scars stand out with white and shining scalloped edges , and Mama Hina still finds knots in the healed fractures that she massages with flashes of pain and pleasure emanating from her fingers . <p> The soft spot on the top of his head has closed up , leaving a lump in the bone that can be felt beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his brown skin , thick lips , and large eyes the color of strong coffee , he resembles the people of the island , if you disregard the long lines of his face and the curved nose . <p> Mama Hina contemplates him with secret wonder  --  he is already older than her grown children  --  as if he holds within him some other measure of time that has begun to assert itself . There is a remoteness in his speech . The darkness he gropes in knows everything that may never see the light of the day again . Every attempt to call up memories of objects and loved ones from another life founders in a violent headache and nausea . The sea has reclaimed his name along with the snapshots of his past ; the rest was obliterated in that blinding flash . <p> The two people who love him most in his re-created world each has a different name for him . They are double names because he has two lives . Tapairo calls him Bora-Bora , the one born of foam , and Moana calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name for him that she says only to herself and which contracts her mouth . She is worried about the direction that her daughter 's inclinations have taken , so overtly of late that she leads the man around by the hand . <p> Tapairo takes him down forbidden paths . The base is cordoned off from the rest of the island ; soldiers are forbidden to fraternize with the islanders . The chief and the pastor decided this together , but neither of them is here . They left with the ship , and nobody knows when they 're coming back . The pastor was one of their own , but the chief is a papa  --  a white man  --  from an unknown country far away , she remarks casually , but he married one of the girls of the island  --  the entire heart shape of her face turns up toward his . <p> They walk around the base area , hand in hand . First they play like children and dart across the open space beneath the basketball nets . Two people alone in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring baskets and tumbling down . Then they are grown-ups in the dark corners and numerous rooms of the base , where she curves up against him , and he feels all his blood pound against her clothing 's light fabric . The contact between them alternates electrically , fleeting and hot , stealing speech from them . At first for long intervals , during which they stammer on , and then completely . Their footsteps remain behind . They cast sidelong glances at each other , suddenly self-conscious , brother and sister but with flushed cheeks . <p> He does n't know what it is ; he is unsure . His body sends out such powerful signals . From the walls , big blond-haired women on glossy paper stare down at him , eyes full of an exaggerated attraction . Tapairo holds him tightly and looks around in the men 's world in an astonishment that is mingled with dread . Their feet echo hollowly , so alone , in the crew 's mess . The walls preserve memories and family photographs . The corner of a letter sticks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dried moisture . Something falls from the envelope : sepia-toned pictures with tiny soldier boys beneath garrison caps and steel helmets , all much too large for them . A girl friend or a sister in a black and white polka-dot dress with her hair falling in ringlets around her ears . He lets go of it as if he has burned his fingers . <p> He grabs at his throat and the ridge of bone beneath his hair , paws and searches himself with that look of delirium that has worried them before . Tapairo flings her arms around his neck ; her words explode with rapid kisses into his ears . She draws him by the hand from the dusty green-steel cabinet whose door has swung open . She makes the heat rise in him again so abruptly that he forgets that he can not remember , and they resume their game from before . He finds chocolate in silver-wrapped bars and lets her eat from his mouth . They open a can of food , try it , and spit it out . <p> When Tapairo spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she tugs him resolutely away with her , into one of the dark rooms with bunk beds , before the magazine catches his gaze . <p> The leaden smell of men 's sleep is trapped in the woodwork , and the bedsprings protest when they sit down . He jumps back up and hits his head against the swaying bunk-bottom above him . Excelsior sifts down from the mattress , catching dryly in his throat ; he coughs and laughs in short gasps . She brushes it from him , removing dirt from his eye with a fingernail , stretches up toward his mouth , laughing , pulls him to her . They kiss for a long time . She is self-assured ; he is lost . Nevertheless , his hands do things that make her sound as if she is crying , though she is n't . He feels his breath breaking apart and snatches air from her mouth . <p> Then his elbow bangs against something behind him , and he stiffens . The window 's shutter has swung open into the room with a rusty sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graffiti carved into the wall in large , clumsy letters : <p> KILROY WAS HERE <p> and a gleam takes possession of his eyes . He throws Tapairo down beneath him . Suddenly he knows far too much . His kisses become hard , and she , whose opening had been warm , contracts into a hard-shelled fruit beneath him . It sounds like crying again  --  and now it is  --  but he does n't hear the difference and forces his way into her taut , vaulted body with a twofold pain . She arches her body , wanting to throw him off , but she is stuck fast to him . A tightness presses against her fused insides , and her blood pounds too violently . She hears his shout high above her , with an unfamiliar triumph in his voice : <p> " You have to call me Kilroy ! " <p> Then both of them explode  --  she into sobs that he will never forget , and he into a total confusion of watery blood and semen and salty tears . It is gone . It slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , " he sits mumbling until it becomes meaningless . " We should n't have done this ! " <p> But by then she was already gone , swallowed up by the sighing palm trees , and for a long time he sat in the barracks by himself with his hands dangling and that old , vacant expression on his face . <p> Translated by Frank Hugus <p> Born in 1945 , lb Michael holds a master 's degree in Central and South American Indian language and culture and has traveled widely throughout Latin America , Chino , Tibet , and the Pacific Islands  --  interests that emerge quite clearly in his fiction .
