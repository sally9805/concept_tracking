<p> Standing on a makeshift stage , a teenage boy and girl are discussing a party . The girl wants to attend , but her jealous boyfriend tells her she ca n't . " You 're my girl , " he says angrily . Then he grabs her , slaps her , and knocks her to the floor , saying , " Look what you made me do . It 's your fault . " <p> For Reneca Logan and Jonathan Camillo , middle-school students in Boston , this troubling scene is only acting , part of a play called " Enough is Enough " to show teens the perils of abusive relationships . But for other teens in all economic and social classes , such treatment mirrors some real-life dates , a secret at odds with their images of young love . <p> At least 1 in 8 teenage relationships involves abuse , according to the Dating Violence Intervention Project in Cambridge , Mass . And in a poll by Children Now , 15 percent of girls between 14 and 17 said a boyfriend had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends , counselors , teachers , ministers , and coaches across the country are mounting dating-violence prevention campaigns . On the premise that battered girlfriends can grow up to be battered wives and bullying boys can turn into battering men , they are using classrooms and theaters to help teens establish healthy relationships and leave abusive ones . <p> " Because teenagers do n't know what the rules of dating relationships are yet and do n't know what their own boundaries are , it 's very easy for girls to get into relationships like that and very difficult to extricate themselves , " says Rosalind Wiseman , executive director of the Empower Program in Bethesda , Md . <p> Confusion about relationships can grow out of gender stereotypes and media images . " Men are supposed to be in control , macho , tough , " says Nancy Isaac , a research associate at Harvard School of Public Health in Cambridge , Mass . " Women are supposed to be beautiful , submissive , and basically there to please men . Those stereotypes essentially support the notion that men are entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselors say , are teen magazines that emphasize the importance of boyfriends , as well as sexually degrading rap lyrics that objectify women 's bodies . <p> " In high school particularly , the message is that you 're nobody if you do n't have a boyfriend , " says Fannie Gilarde , a community coordinator for Dove , a battered women 's shelter in Quincy , Mass . <p> Students also " do a lot of minimizing " about abuse , Ms. Gilarde says . " They 'll say , ' He does n't beat me , he just slaps me . ' They think if they 're not bruised and they do n't fit the myth of what a battered person looks like - black eye , split lip - they 're not being abused . Rarely do they identify with emotional , verbal , and control issues . " Control includes telling a girlfriend what she can and can not wear , who her friends can be , and where she can go . <p> " Verbal abuse always starts first , " Ms. Wiseman says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stupid . Shut up . ' It gradually builds up . He thinks he can take out all his frustrations on you . " As tension grows , a boy may become physically violent , as Mr. Camillo does in " Enough Is Enough . " Then comes the " honeymoon " phase , when he apologizes , gives his girlfriend flowers , and promises not to hit her again . That vow is often short-lived . <p> Sometimes abuse becomes so aggravated that teens take out restraining orders . In one 10-month period in Massachusetts during 1992 and 1993 , 753 restraining orders involved a defendant who was 17 or younger . " When teens feel the need to get a restraining order , you 're talking about pretty serious fear , " Dr. Isaac says . <p> Most efforts to prevent this kind of abuse take place in health classes or physical-education programs , with adults as instructors . Although most programs are privately funded , the Massachusetts Department of Education has allocated $ 250,000 for dating-violence prevention programs in 31 communities . It is the only state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dating Violence Intervention Project . <p> Other programs feature plays with teen actors . In " Enough Is Enough , " sponsored by a Boston youth-development group called Weatoc , the battered girlfriend , played by Ms. Logan , leaves her abusive boyfriend . The skit , Logan says , " lets young women know that if their boyfriend hits them , they do n't have to stay with him , no matter what . " <p> In Denver this spring , a teen drama group called Project PAVE will reach a thousand middle-school students with a half-hour " talk show " dealing with dating relationships . Another program in North Carolina , called Safe Dates , features a 45-minute play as part of a 10-session curriculum . <p> " We 're seeing changes in knowing what behavior is acceptable and what 's not , changes in gender stereotyping , and a greater awareness of community resources that can help , " says Vangee Foshee , an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill . She adds , " With eighth- and ninth-graders , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriends . " <p> Schools are not the only institutions seeking solutions . In Circle Pines , Minn. , the Rev. Dale Peterson , pastor of Our Savior 's Lutheran Church , holds an annual retreat for his confirmation classes of seventh , eighth , and ninth graders . He uses " dating-rights " lists as one way of helping students distinguish between healthy and abusive relationships . <p> Reverend Peterson encourages girls to be more assertive and to understand that their bodies are their own . He talks to boys about the sports terms men use to reduce relationships to a game or a win-lose proposition . He also involves parents in another retreat dealing with teen issues , including dating violence . <p> Companies too can play a part in heightening parents ' awareness . In January , the Illusion Theater , a Minneapolis theater group that addresses social issues , presented its latest play , " Talk It Out , " to 250 employees of a suburban electronics firm . In one scene , a football quarterback admits he beat his girlfriend because she wanted to break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group , " parents asked , ' How do I get my kids to start talking to me before they start beating up their girlfriends ? " <p> Wiseman encounters similar questions . " Parents desperately ask me , ' How do we get kids out of abusive relationships ? ' I tell them , just be there for your kids and say , ' I do n't know what 's going on , but you can always come to me and talk about it . ' It 's very important for parents to say , ' We can get through this . ' " <p> A Nike TV ad promoting athletics for girls includes the lines , " If you let me play sports , I will know what it means to be strong ... I will be more likely to leave a man who beats me . " <p> Yet ignorance still exists . Sheila Wellstone of St. Paul , Minn. , a domestic-violence prevention advocate , held a town meeting in an affluent suburb of the Twin Cities . Four high school girls explained how they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the audience were shocked , " says Mrs. Wellstone . " They did not want to believe this was happening in their community . " <p> Increasingly , reaching out to young men ranks as an important part of prevention efforts . Robert Gallup , executive director of Amend in Denver , notes that 30 percent of adult domestic violence behavior started in adolescence . " We have more success with men who have shorter histories of abuse toward women . The earlier we get in there , the better . " <p> Jackson Katz , director of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University in Boston , urges young men to speak out when they see other men abusing girlfriends . He also encourages young women to " confront boyfriends and any forms of abuse by men . It works . " <p> Helping young men , Wiseman adds , "
