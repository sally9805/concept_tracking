<p> Keep those cards and letters coming <p> As of Friday afternoon , 3,083 people had taken the trouble of filling out my totally unscientific Olympic survey ( which appeared in last Sunday 's paper ) and depositing the results on my desk . <p> Yikes ! I did n't expect that much mail . ( Neither , I should add , did the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games . I 'm told that ACOG 's executives expected I 'd get about 200 replies . ) <p> Anyway , I 've examined 300 of those 3,083 returns , or roughly 10 percent , and now I want to tell a bit about what this sample has to say . <p> ( I 'll have more on the results Wednesday , when this Diary will appear , as it always does on Wednesdays , on the back of a section of the paper . Anyway , check the front-page index . ) <p> Here 's one striking pattern that emerged from my 300-person sample : 214 of those 300 said they were " pleased " when Atlanta got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt the same way . <p> But when asked if they feel " confident " the ' 96 Olympics will come off well and Atlanta will be better off in 1996 - 240 of the 300 answered " no . " <p> This is upsetting . This is alarming . Either something is going sufficiently wrong that many people are worried - or else my survey is badly skewed . <p> Whichever , let me say here that the respondents ' worry and concern are not mainly the result of negative publicity or " the media . " Billy Payne criticized the media the other day for trying to " fill up all that empty space with all those empty heads writing the words . " I 'd say there 's some of that , but it 's not the main problem . <p> I think worries about Atlanta 's Olympics are due in part to a feeling that the Olympics belong to somebody else . I 've had many letters , for example - and even more scribbled notes - that thanked me for asking what the silent masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of my 300-person sample answered " no " when asked if they felt their opinion matters . <p> As for Whatizit , ACOG 's controversial mascot , exactly 14 people out of 300 checked " love it . " <p> The overwhelming majority checked " hate it " ( often with unprintable or touching remarks about why ) , and scores of others checked " do n't really care " or " wish everybody would shut up . " <p> ACOG has been saying lately that kids are crazy about Whatizit , a creature chosen by Billy Payne and a handful of others . They may be right about kids ' tastes . I got several thick packages of responses from schools , and it 's obvious that kids like Whatizit better than grown-ups do . <p> But when it comes to grown-ups , 14 out of 300 claimed they loved it . <p> Again , my survey could be off base . But I get the feeling that the mascot is so unpopular that ACOG should consider admitting its error and moving on to better battles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatizit , the yes and no votes seemed too evenly divided to inspire tabulation . ( The phoenix , by the way , is more popular than Brer Rabbit , my No. 1 choice . ) <p> The question of how the Olympics are actually organized seemed to baffle people . ( It often baffles me . ) But when asked if they feel they understand who 's in charge and who will pay and who will profit , 128 of my 300 answered no , 58 said they were n't sure , and only 59 of 300 expressed full confidence ( often accompanied by cynical jokes ) that they understood everything . <p> That 's a message , I 'd say , for journalists . Maybe we should be doing more explaining . ( In what ways is ACOG private , for example , and in what ways is it actually public ? Just what rights , responsibilities and opportunities does the city have ? How do ordinary citizens fit in ? ) <p> The respondents gave ACOG a rather dubious vote . Has ACOG been handling things well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my 300-person sample . " Mixed , " answered 127 others . " Yes , " replied only 34 people . <p> ( Like Whatizit , Billy Payne did much better than that among schoolchildren . Someday I 'm going to try to figure out whether all aspects of American society are now being designed for children , or whether " doing it for the kids " has replaced patriotism as the last refuge of scoundrels , or what . ) <p> The city fared even worse than ACOG in the survey . " How do you feel Mayor Jackson and the city government are handling the Olympics ? " <p> " Poorly , " answered 204 people . " So-so , " said 90 others . Only 17 of my 300 answered " well . " <p> There 's no room today to get into the survey 's questions about Olympic czars , special worries , what people want from the Olympics and what good qualities they wish Atlanta were famous for . <p> But let me add some of the comments people wrote in the black space beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would . . . " <p> " emphasize the characteristics that Atlanta truly does have - the beautiful trees , and hills and homes , the strong upper middle-class black community , the Civil War and human rights , the quality of architecture Downtown , the friendly , polite people . " <p> " look for the brightest and most competent people . No relatives of politicians should be hired . " <p> " hire an independent committee of experts on urban renewal , Olympic planning and social and governmental reform to help me clean up the city and address the crime problem . " <p> " leave town at first opportunity . " <p> " ignore all the special-interest whining . " <p> " organize the ordinary people . " <p> " begin immediately to work on the chosen sites and not waste time . " <p> " kill the Whatizit - that stupid little thing that started a negative avalanche . " <p> " make the city safe , then worry about the Olympics . " <p> " enlist the support of the city population by involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " tell the City Council to shut up and do something . " <p> " develop outline of master plan ; let everyone know what plan is developing ; get public support for plan . " <p> " get work started . " <p> " cut through the red tape , quit worrying about the constituencies and do what needs to be done to make these Olympics great . " <p> And there were hundreds , indeed thousands , more . <p> A postscript : <p> How valid is this survey ? Not very . Many of those who went to the trouble of addressing envelopes and licking stamps may have acted out of an unusual passion or frustration . It 's possible , too , that a lot of people who do n't feel frustrated did n't bother to complete the survey , or were too busy or whatever . <p> On the other hand , the past week 's flood of mail - scientifically unrepresentative though it may be - does look pretty various . The respondents plainly included lawyers , children , writers , Southsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retirees , semiliterates , suburbanites , wits , people with access to ACOG stationery , advertising executives , men , women , etc . <p> I know all this because hundreds of the questionnaires arrived in company envelopes ; also with postmarks , comments , signatures , return addresses , felicitations , insults and more . <p> So my survey may be skewed , but I 'd be surprised if it turned out to be totally wrong . <p> Wednesday : More on what people really think about the 1996 Atlanta Olympics .
