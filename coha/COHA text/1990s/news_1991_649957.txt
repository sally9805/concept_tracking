##@x <p> Though I still think that punitive sanctions would have better served America 's long-term interests , clearly the military victory over Iraq was easier than expected . However , there is a growing  --  but still avoidable  --  risk that the war may come to be seen as having precipitated a geopolitical disaster and a moral disgrace . <p> The increasingly messy aftermath of the war gives rise to two central questions : What are the principal benefits and debits of our triumph ? What are the immediate and longer-range implications for subsequent U.S. policy ? <p> The benefits are undeniably impressive . First , a blatant act of aggression was rebuffed and punished . An important political and even legal point , central to international decency , was reaffirmed : that the community of nations will not tolerate the brutal use of force by one state against another . <p> Second , U.S. military power is henceforth likely to be taken more seriously . The technological and strategic virtuosity of the U.S. military performance , as well as the display of personal determination by U.S. decision-makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away as North Korea , a dictatorship reputed to be acquiring nuclear weapons of its own . <p> Third , the Middle East and Persian Gulf region is now clearly an American sphere of preponderance . Pro-American Arab regimes feel more secure ; so does Israel . U.S. access to oil is now not in jeopardy . <p> Fourth , the Soviet Union , until recently America 's principal rival in the Middle East , to all intents and purpose has now been reduced largely to the status of a spectator . <p> However , some negative consequences must also be placed on the scales . First , the most immediate regional beneficiary of Iraq 's downfall has been Iran , a power openly hostile to the U.S. and to America 's satellite regimes on the Arabian Peninsula . America 's military presence in the region is now imperative . This is not necessarily inimical to U.S. interests , but potentially is a source of new instabilities . <p> Second , that presence is related to the growing danger that the war 's aftermath is intensifying the region 's barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Iraq could become part of a prolonged chain reaction , eventually " Lebanonizing " the region as a whole while bogging the U.S. down in it . <p> Third , the very intensity of the air assault on Iraq gives rise to concern that the conduct of the war may come to be seen as evidence that Americans view Arab lives as worthless . <p> The last consideration raises sensitive moral issues . The war was presented to the public as a " just war , " made necessary both by the immorality of Saddam Hussein 's action and by the scale of the threat he posed . He was portrayed as if he were another Hitler , menacing the whole world . In fact , he turned out to have been much more like Mussolini . <p> And that raises the moral question of the proportionality of response . U.S. spokesmen repeatedly stated that the objective was not the destruction of Iraq and that the enemy was Mr. Hussein and not the Iraqi people . However , the air assault against Iraq was heavily directed , doubtless for military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , with adverse consequences for the well-being of innocent people . <p> This conclusion emerges starkly from the report submitted to the U.N . by the Finnish head of a special investigative mission , Marti Ahtissari . It itemizes the destruction of nonmilitary targets . Some 90 percent of the industrial labor force has been deprived of work and income ; the country 's " sole laboratory producing veterinary vaccines " was destroyed by bombing ; so were its " seed warehouses , " with " all stocks of potatoes and vegetable seeds , " thereby placing in jeopardy seasonal planting . Because of the deliberate destruction of power plants and other sources of energy , " all electrically operated installations have ceased to function , " causing a shortage of water and forcing the population to rely on contaminated water supply . " All modern communications systems have been destroyed , " etc . <p> The mission concluded that the population faced " a catastrophe " from epidemics and undernourishment , unless relief was forthcoming . <p> The human misery produced by the war has subsequently been compounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naively ) counting on American support , the uprisings have been repressed with massive force and brutality . The resulting flight of the Kurds then created further suffering , with the Kurds subjected to deaths and deprivations on a shocking scale . <p> All this is relevant to any calculus of the war 's benefits and debits . It raises the possibility that the war may have been a classical case of an under-reaction to earlier signs of Mr. Hussein 's aggressiveness that later prompted an over-reaction to the eventual act of aggression . This over-reaction may have prompted what might be deemed in moral terminology a " disproportionate " response . <p> It is important to raise this troubling issue , especially given the emphasis on the idea of the " just war " and the deliberate evocation of Churchillian symbols and rhetoric to gain public support . The fact is the war was not waged against all odds , against an all-powerful opponent  --  as had been the case against Hitler  --  but it pitted the world 's only superpower against a third world country armed with second-best weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing morality and geopolitics in mind ? The point of departure for any answer must be the recognition that the U.S. now has unprecedented influence on the fate of an entire region . <p> After World War II , Harry S. Truman recognized America 's moral and political responsibility for the future of Europe . He rose to that challenge through a firm commitment to large-scale relief , reconstruction and reconciliation . Today , the Persian Gulf and Middle East needs all three . Relief must be undertaken on a massive scale : for the Kurds in the first place , for the Shiites and for other Iraqis as well . <p> The dispatching of U.S. forces to shield encampments in Iraq for the displaced Kurds is a right step , but it is difficult to understand how U.S. forces can vacate the occupied parts of southern Iraq without first obtaining a firm commitment from Baghdad to alter the political status of the Iraqi Kurds very significantly . <p> Beyond this immediate  --  partly moral and partly political  --  imperative , it behooves the U.S. to pursue actively three broad goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redistribution of regional wealth and for enhanced economic cooperation among all the region 's states ( including Israel ) and a serious movement toward Arab-Israeli peace . <p> Fortunately , there are signs the U.S. is moving in that direction . But to succeed it will have to pursue all three goals together . There can be no regional security , including arms control and other arrangements to minimize a repetition of the Iraqi aggression , without some progress on the other two central issues . And there can be no movement on Israeli-Arab peace , including eventually some form of statehood for the Palestinians , without a wider accommodation that tackles the region 's strategic and social vulnerability . <p> President Truman recognized the challenge of relief , reconstruction and reconciliation . America rose to the challenge . That is why Europe is safe and healthy today . For geopolitical and moral reasons , America should undertake no less in the Middle East . @@649957 My name is Peter Parker and I 'm the sort of person who occasionally gets in a little over his head . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hood , walking down the hall next to me , " is not to show them any fear . If you hesitate , or look like you do n't know what you 're doing , even for a second , they 'll sense the weakness . They 'll eat you alive . " <p> " No fear , " I said . " No getting eaten . Check . " <p> " I 'm serious . You 're outnumbered . They 're faster , most of them are stronger , they can run you into the ground , and if you 're going to keep it under control , you 're going to have to win the battle here . " He touched a finger to his forehead . " You get me ? " <p> " Mind war , " I said . " Wax on . Wax off . " <p> The man in the dark hood stopped , frowned at me , and said , " You are n't taking this seriously . " <p> " People always think that about me , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , that 's what I mean , " Coach Kyle said . He tucked his hands into the pockets of his workout jacket and shook his head . " You go joking around with them like that , and that 's it . You 've lost control . " <p> " It 's a basketball practice , " I said . " Not a prison riot . " <p> Coach Kyle was about six feet tall , with a slender build . Dark skin , and dark hair which apparently had n't started to go gray , though he had to have been in his late forties . He wore thick glasses with black plastic Marine-issue , birth-control rims . He 'd been a Hoosier , starting guard , back in the day . He had n't made the cut to the pros . " I see , " he said with a snort . " You 're upset because you were the one who got stuck with running the team . " <p> " Well , " I hedged , " I was n't much for sports when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last week 's faculty meeting , " he told me cheerfully . " If you had n't been the last one to arrive at this meeting , you 'd be halfway home by now . " <p> " I know . " I sighed . <p> " Guess you had something more important come up ? " <p> I 'd been crawling around about two hundred and fifty berjillion freight-train-sized shipping containers at the piers , looking for the one the mob was using to ship out illegal immigrants for sale on the slave market . Officially speaking , they were n't people , since they had n't filled out the right paperwork and learned the secret American handshake from the INS . Unofficially speaking , scum who target people who ca n't defend themselves incite me to creative outrage . By the time I had the last of them webbed to the side of their slave container in the shape of the word " LOSERS " I 'd been five minutes late to the faculty meeting already . <p> But that 's not the kind of thing you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my homework , " I said instead . <p> Coach Kyle shook his head , grinning , and we stopped outside the door to the gym . " Look . Your big worry is the tallest kid there . Samuel . Best strong center I ever had , and he could go all the way . Problem is he knows it , and he does n't play well with others . " <p> " The fiend , " I said . " This is a job for Superman . " <p> Coach Kyle sighed . " Peter . Samuel 's mom works three jobs to make enough to feed him and his three little brothers and sisters . Their block is n't such a good one . He had an older brother who was a gangbanger  --  that is , until he got stabbed to death a few years back . That 's when Samuel took over as man of the house . Looking out for the little ones . " <p> I sighed , and dialed down my snark projector . <p> " Go on . " <p> " Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete , and if he can make it into a college , he can help out his whole family . Problem is that he 's a good kid , at the core . " <p> " That 's a problem ? " <p> " Yes . Because if he does n't get himself under control and make it into a good school , he 'll graduate and try to support his family . " <p> I nodded my head , getting it . " And wind up in the same place as his brother . " <p> Coach Kyle nodded . " He 's big , tough , and can make good money in a gang . And it is n't as if he 's going to have employers kicking down his door to get to him . " <p> " I see . " I glanced through the narrow window in the door to the gym . A lot of young people were running and screaming . Shoes squeaked on the floor . Many , many basketballs thudded onto the court in a rhythm that could only have been duplicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need me to do ? " <p> " Right now , the kid is his own worst enemy . If he does n't learn to work with his team , to lead on the court , no university will even look at him . " <p> " But he has n't realized that yet , " I guessed . <p> Coach Kyle nodded . " I just want you to understand , Peter . Coaching the basketball team is n't just a chore that needs doing . It is n't only a game . The team might be this kid 's only chance . Same goes for the others , to a lesser degree . The team keeps them off the streets , out of some of the trouble . " <p> I watched the kids playing and nodded . " I hear you . I 'll take it seriously . " I met his eyes and said , " Promise . " <p> " Thank you , " Coach Kyle said , and offered me his hand . " To tell you the truth , I was hoping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . I see you with some of the other kids . You do good work . " <p> I traded grips with him and grinned . " Well , I 'm so childish myself . " <p> " Heh , " he said . " Maybe I should come in with you for a minute . Just to help you get started . " <p> " It 's okay , " I said . " I can handle it myself . Have fun getting lasered in the eyes . " <p> He tapped his ugly glasses with one finger . " See you next week , " he said . Then he headed out . <p> I sighed and opened the door to the gymnasium . After all , it was n't like I 'd never been outnumbered before . I 'd gone up against the Sinister Six versions one through fifty or sixty , and the Sinister Syndicate , and those bozos in the Wrecking Crew , and ... the X-Men ? No , that could n't be right . I had n't ever taken on the X-Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , yes . And if I could handle them , surely I could handle a bunch of kids playing basketball . <p> Which only goes to show that just because I happen to be a fairly sharp scientist , the Amazing Spider-Man , and a snappy dancer , I do n't know everything . <p> copyright 2006 by Marvel Characters <br> Continues ...
