The suitors began paying court months ago . When H. Ross Perot stopped by Hilton Head , South Carolina , last year , his " phone pal " Lamar Alexander , the former Governor of Tennessee who would soon become a Republican candidate for President , personally rushed out to the airport to meet him and drive him to the waterside home where the Governor was vacationing . There , over iced tea in a living room overlooking Calibogue Sound , Alexander , in his khakis , and Perot , in his business suit , indulged in some plain talk . " Ross , " Alexander said , " if you do what you did last time , we 'll get Clinton again . " And what did Perot say he 'd do ? " I could n't tell , " Alexander says of the Texan , who has been similarly pitched by other Republicans . The Governor readily admits his motives . " What I 'm going to try to do is give the people who voted for him something to be for . If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Alexander might be right . With more than a bit of coyness , Perot says , " There are ways to get me to go away . " <P> The Republicans can not imagine anything better than Perot going away . Bill Clinton can not imagine anything worse . Perot  --  and , more precisely , the millions of disaffected voters who support him and distrust the established parties  --  holds the key to the next election . Whichever way he  --  and they  --  goes will determine who wins the White House in 1996 . The proof of this will come later this week when the entire G.O.P. presidential field ( from Bob Dole to Illinois businessman Maurice Taylor ) , the Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate , a bipartisan mishmash of Washington politicians , even Jesse Jackson , converge in Dallas for an unprecedented three-day pander-ama . Each , in his way , hopes Perot will be all ears . <P> The occasion is " Preparing Our Country for the 21st Century , " a convention of up to 8,000 members of Perot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to a national party to emerge from the antiestablishment rebellion he sparked in 1992 . Although he will be on Larry King Live again this week and has a penchant for hogging the limelight , Perot insists his sole duty in Dallas is to act as host to the visiting luminaries , all of whom he will introduce before they appear at the podium . Furthermore , he no longer appears hell-bent on running for President , and is not going to form an actual third party . <P> The Republicans are heartened by this subdued Perot . Many see it as an indication that he simply wants to be a player , not the player in the coming presidential race . Perot seems to be encouraging this line . Rhetorically he asks , " Did you ever hear of anyone who has a personal political agenda renting a big arena , attracting a crowd from all over the country and letting what could be his opponents speak ? " And replies : " No ! Surely that makes the point . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
