<p> SIGMAR POLKE 'S tall artworks which cover a wall with shifting colors are a looming presence , like Gibraltar or the Black Slab in Kubrick 's " 200l " or flying into a bank of storm clouds . <p> Yhey are part of a mysterious series by the German-born artist included in the show on view through May 5 at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden . They are grouped under the title " The Spirits That Lend Strength Are Invisible . " One painting has a subtitle : " Tellurium Terrestrial Material " because it 's made of pure tellurium , a semimetallic element related to selenium and sulfur . In this case , pure tellurium is blown onto artificial resin on a huge canvas , 157 in. by 118 1/2 in . <p> The resulting art is enormous , shiny , glistening , and extremely hard looking , like armor . The second in the series , a whirl of golds and yellows contains one kilogram of a meteor ( extraterrestrial material found west of Tocopilla , Chile ) , thrown onto artificial resin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; silver nitrate is used in the fourth , subtitled " Salt of Silver " and the fifth subtitled " Otter Creek , " includes silver leaf , neolithic tools , and artificial resin on canvas . You can see the neolithic tools , which look like metallic arrow heads , embedded in the painting . <p> The overall effect of the five large " alchemic " works , which could be unearthly abstract expressionist paintings , is inexplicable . The artificial resin used has a golden sheen , which lights up the paintings as you move around them . And the appearance of the works shifts according to temperature and humidity , like a " mood " ring . <p> " The Spirits That Lend Strength Are Invisible " series title was based on a Native American proverb . The show 's organizer , John Caldwell , curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , says in the catalog that " The whole suite is an homage to and meditation on the Americas because it utilizes for its creation only materials associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also calls it " a culmination of his work to date 201 a series of five paintings ( Polke ) made for the 1988 Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh ... " <p> More than l00 of Polke 's paintings , works on paper and special art works are included in the show , his first full retrospective in the United States . Polke 's influence on other artists is significant , but he is better known in Europe . <p> Another unforgettable series , which illustrates Polke 's melding of social consciousness with art is the haunting " Watchtower " grouping . Again , the works of art are huge ( " Watchtower with Geese " ) is 114 3/16 inches square ) . <p> Polke 's high , spindly , sinister watchtower has a cumulative effect in series , like Monet 's haystacks or Rouen cathedrals or Cezanne 's Chateau Noirs . <p> While this series is compelling , it is also grim , full of the tragedy of the Nazi concentration camps . <p> This is most evident in Watchtower 11 , done in silver , silver oxide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murky half-light . But Polke seems to treat it as gallows humor in " Watchtower with Geese " which juxtaposes the watchtower symbol with fabric on which a gaggle of geese waddles . <p> But the surrealistic horror of his concentration camp images comes through most clearly in his earlier " Lager " ( Camp ) , which comes at you like an enormous freight train , 14 feet high and eight feet wide . <p> The bottom third of the work is a powerful charge of diabolic blackness , bounded on either side and above with walls of razored barbed wire and black lights . Horizontal lashes of purple lines are superimposed over the metallic gold sunset which forms the top third of the work . <p> It is an unforgettable image of acrylic and spattered pigment on fabric and blanket . Burned into the blanket at intervals are grotesque holes which reveal glimpses of the white walls behind in light and shadow . The blanket humanizes the painting , which is the view seen by inmates of the camp . <p> Mr. Caldwell suggests in the show 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which until recently guarded the boundary between East and West Germany . <p> Polke was born in Oels , in Silesia , which was then the eastern part of Germany . At the age of 12 , in 1953 , he simply got on a subway going to West Berlin , pretended to be asleep , and crossed safely to the West . <p> He grew up in a post-war Germany that was often deprived of food . Later he painted pop art images of doughnuts , bread , and a chocolate bar . <p> By the 60 's , American Pop Art figures like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein had crossed his horizon . <p> He briefly studied the art of glass painting , then had enrolled in the Art Academy in D159sseldorf , where he and artists Gerhard Richter and Konrad Fischer-Lueg began painting in a style they called " Capitalist Realism , " a pun on the Socialist Realism of Germany . <p> He then went through a period of zapping the art and culture of his times with satirical paintings of several styles , including Color-Field paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paintings . <p> Polke 's humor pops out in a vast acrylic on canvas called " Peruke " - a woman in a powdered wig so mountainous that birds fly in and out of it . <p> Powerful is the only word that describes some of Polke 's other paintings - layer on layer of images , often on fabric . Walking into a room full of them , you feel you need a translation to understand . <p> Can one get the picture ? It 's a bit difficult because , according to Caldwell , these paintings are " a depiction of the distortions of reality that might be induced by ingesting psychedelic substances . " <p> There is , for instance , " Alice in Wonderland , " done in mixed media on fabric strips . One strip is of basketball players on a green court , another of blue and black polka dots with images of Alice with caterpillar , hookah pipe , and magic mushrooms superimposed on them . <p> About that painting , Caldwell says " the theme of drug-altered consciousness is explicit . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of violet , bronze , and black oil on canvas . After this period , Polke turned to his major series , " Watchtower " and " The Spirits That Lend Strength Are Invisible . " <p> This exhibition of the work of Sigmar Polke , who is now living in Cologne , Germany , is touring the US . After closing at the Hirshhorn , the show will go to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago ( June 20-Sept. 8 ) ; then the Brooklyn Museum ( Oct. 11 , 1991-Jan. 6 , 1992.
