( The stage area is completely bare except for a dish containing sage and matches , and two rock crystals on the floor . The two actors enter . SHE lights the sage and smudges herself with the smoke . HE smudges himself . SHE fans the smoke towards the audience , then blots the sage . ) SHE This one looks like a European movie , all muted colours , things that do n't look like anything at first , and then it 's as if the camera pulls back and the focus clears . It 's hot , everything is washed out . There 's a white crumbling room with bodies sleeping in dirty clothes . The place is crowded , and it stinks . I know that I 'm in a ghetto of some kind , that there are hundreds of rooms like this , stacked and twisted , crushed together . Crying babies , shouts , swearing , bells tolling , cross-eyed , inbred children , no one knows what year it is . I 'm twelve years old and he 's been watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . I even wiggle my bum a little when he 's around . He brought me something special to eat once , and I ate it all alone , hiding . I 'm twelve years old , when I found the blood , my mother laughed , then crossed herself . " Now you 're in for it . " The night he comes , I sort of expect it , but I do n't know what it is . My dad 's got huge arms and a bloated face , big bulging brown eyes with lots of veins , all watery , like a dog 's . He just hauls himself on me , pulls my legs apart , then shoves his thing up me , like a kitchen knife like a knife so far up I did n't know it could go , so far up I think it 's going to rip me in pieces , pounding away . When he crawls off I wipe the slob from my cunt and I get out of there . Maybe I kill him , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gang of kids , we steal food and sleep on the street . I get sick all the time . I do n't let anyone talk to me . I know . Inside I know . I get big , the rest of me gets really skinny . They tell me I 've got one in me . They take their fingers and shove them through a circle , poking and poking , then they waddle around like me . Sometimes they shove their little boys ' cocks at me , but I grab them and squeeze till they run away , holding their little things in their hands . Sometimes they throw some food at me . I wake up and it 's there . One of the older girls says when it starts to hurt I have to go to the nuns . They 've got some kind of place up on the hill for people to die in . She says to go there . One day I start to squirm , like I ate bad chickens and have to shit yellow for days . Cramping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to shit but I ca n't . I have to get to those nuns , do n't want people watching me on the street . I 'm starting to grunt like a pig . Where are the fucking nuns ? People look at me , squatting down by the side of the road , panting like a goat when it gets me bad . They know what 's going on , why else would I be holding my belly like I want to die ? If they come close I 'll kill them . Holding on , got to hold on . I can see it now , top of the hill . What are they going to do ? Make me kneel down and pray ? I ca n't do that , I ca n't , ohhhh Jesus , that 's from right underneath my twot . I got ta carry it now , carry myself in my hands . I droop down so much , maybe it 'll just fall out on the road , I 'd leave it there and go back .

" They kind of drag me in , the room 's got beds and flies , old people lying still like dead people , kids with no arms , one with a big head , they 're groaning and moaning , it smells of hot blood . I 'm crazy now , louder than any of them , the nuns have thin lips and sour faces , " Do n't touch me , do n't go in there .

Think of the baby . " Her voice is so sweet I can hardly I talk I say , " I do n't want it , I hate it . " All she says is , " The next time when it comes , think of the baby . " The next time it comes , I 'm begging them to kill me , take the knife , I can see the knife and put it up the same place and kill me . Do n't look at me , do n't look at me .

" I 'm gone I 'm gone there 's nothing but I push them away and fall on the floor . I 'm on my hands and knees howling and shitting there 's nothing left somebody 's holding my head , I heave and heave and heave . There 's red and black . Then nothing . I open my eyes against the black , see a bloody bundle being carried out . I try to talk , try to say , " Show it to me , show me the baby . " But I know it 's dead . I do n't know if I hear it , but I hear " strangled . " It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's dead . Then all I know is craziness . Dirt and hate and craziness .

Thank you . . . holy shit . HE Hi . SHE Hi . HE Come on in . Do you want wine , or beer , or brandy , or . . . SHE I 'll take wine . HE I was just practising my guitar . SHE It 's not loud enough . HE I 've got to have some thought for the neighbours , although I think it all evens out in the end . SHE Probably does . HE Let 's sit outside . SHE Okay . . . Nice sky . HE Yeah . SHE I got home today and there were six guys with jackhammers tearing down my front steps , then this huge cement truck arrives and looks like it 's going to pave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this giant hole in the sidewalk . They 're building a Portuguese Parthenon next door and they have to tear down my steps to do it . HE That 's a drag . p. 4 SHE I can hardly get into the house . There 's just the edges of the steps left , like ruins . HE Do you have to pay for new steps ? SHE No , they could n't carve the steps in half to leave new steps so they had to replace mine anyway . HE That 's one good thing . SHE Yeah . HE . . . so I 've been on tenterhooks all day . What did you want to talk to me about ? SHE Oh , I do n't know . HE I think you do .

What do you want to do , do you want to talk about it ? SHE I do n't know . I guess not . I feel like I 'm swimming , just swimming out there in the mid-Atlantic . HE Do you want to keep swimming for a while , or . . .

HE That 's incredible . And then this morning did you see what I pulled out of the envelope ? SHE I could n't believe it . The Pro Choice News . I thought it was a sign . p. 6 HE Just goes to show this household does n't avoid those issues . SHE I found myself imagining what you 'd do . Making up a whole thing in my head about you , thinking for you . HE I 'm supposed to want to run , is n't that the assumed male response ? SHE Yes .

If you want to talk about it , I 'll talk about it . SHE No , you 're right , I 'd rather swim . HE How 's the swimming ? SHE Weird . HE Well , it 's seven o'clock now , we could see a movie , or eat , or if we went really fast we could do both . What would you like to do ? SHE I 'm not very fast . I started getting this dizzy feeling , like the earth was n't really under my feet , like everything just took a step sideways and I was n't on it . HE We do n't have to see a movie , I could just work here on my own or we could watch television or you could go off on your own and think or . . . p. 7 SHE No , no , I 'd like to see a movie .

SHE I could take them tonight , besides it 's supposed to be warm-hearted and comforting . HE Okay , eight fifteen , that would give us time to eat . Do you want to eat ? What have you eaten today ? SHE Not much . HE Indian food ? SHE Sure . HE Let 's go . ( SHE sways . HE holds her . ) Are you having one of these dizzy things ? SHE Yeah . HE It 's okay , no hurry . SHE I feel like I 'm making it up HE Making it up so that I can almost feel it too . SHE I 'm okay now . HE Are you sure ? p. 8 SHE Yeah . ( SHE nearly falls again . ) Oh , Jesus , this is for real . HE The way she looked , the way I felt , I let her in , in that split second , / something went in . Like some kind of miracle . . . SHE The way he acted , the way he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It went through us like a knife . . . HE It 's something you read about , / I thought it would never happen to me . . . SHE I thought it would never happen to me . It could be done , it could actually be done / HE There 's no way , I just / feel sick inside . Do n't come down hard , do n't push her too hard , do n't be too hard . . . SHE It 's not so crazy really , it 's possible , but is it possible / with him ? HE She 's going to go through it , it 's in her , / inside her . . . SHE He 's the father now , not just some guy . . . HE Ca n't do it , ca n't do it , we should have talked / right then , dangerous to wait . . . SHE I feel real , finally something real in me . He took my hand to cross the street / like there were three of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand , the way he touched , that there were three of us crossing the street . p. 9 HE I ca n't let myself feel it . Never take her hand like that again . That would be too cruel . Help her somehow . Be clear but not cruel . How / could it have happened ? SHE I know why it happened . . . HE There are n't three of us crossing the street . Not now . There ca n't be . Not three of us crossing the street . HE Good morning . SHE Hi . HE I made an omelette but I assumed you would n't be eating this morning . SHE No . HE I have to go shopping , make a couple of phone calls , then tonight is that barbecue . Do you want to go ? SHE Do n't know , ca n't tell yet . HE Just let me know . Do you want some tea ? SHE Sure . HE It 's already made . SHE How long have we known each other ? HE Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE If you count when I went away . p. 10 SHE If you count when you went away , then it 's three months . HE Or two and a half . HE Hi . SHE Hi . Did you have a good time ? HE It was okay . Saw a few people , yacked away . SHE You stayed quite late . HE I could n't leave right away . ( HE yawns . ) SHE I know , I just thought . HE You were the one that said that I should go . SHE I know , I just . . . Imagine what you could say , you could have a ball , you really could , a kind of complete moral authority . " There I was , coughing up my insides , passing out on the stairs , carrying your child , and you had to have another beer . " It does n't matter . Do you want something to drink ? HE I had to have that fifth beer , if I did n't have that beer , I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birthday , thinking , the worst thing I could imagine has happened . I 'm fine for now . SHE I do n't want to swim anymore . p. 11 HE Whatever you say . SHE I 'm stoned . HE I thought you ran out . SHE On hormones . I ca n't help thinking about it . HE Me too , not an hour goes by that I . . . SHE Five minutes , with me it 's every five minutes , every minute . HE I can understand . SHE What I hate is the inevitability of it . HE What 's inevitable ? SHE That it will be stopped . I 'm trying not to speak for you . I want to , but I 'm trying not to . Maybe I should speak for you . But I wo n't . Okay ? I wo n't . I 'm thinking all kinds of things , like what it would be like to have it on my own . But maybe I 'm wrong , maybe you 're not thinking like that , I just keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of plans , I know that . I just have been assuming some things . HE What things ? SHE I want to talk about it . HE Do you want me to talk about it too ? Or do you just want to talk about it ? p. 12 SHE I want you to talk about it . ( HE yawns . ) Maybe you 're tired , you 've had too many beer . HE No , I 'm fine , why do you say that ? ( HE yawns again . ) SHE Woman 's intuition . HE All right . It 's not a time when I want to consider having a family , it 's a time of flux in my life . I do have a two-year plan , I do n't think it 's wrong to have one , and there are a lot of things I want to do , and raising a child is n't one of them . I would n't want you to , but if you were to go ahead , then I would want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The iron has entered my soul . HE Sorry to disappoint you .

SHE I 'm agreeing with you , I mean , it 's ridiculous , outrageous . HE Oh . . . yes . . . we do n't really know anything about the other person . p. 13 SHE No , we do n't . HE So , this pregnancy business . . . SHE Do n't call it that . HE Do n't call it what ? SHE " This pregnancy business . " Do n't call it that . HE Sorry . SHE I can see the picture . The two us are lying on this bed and we 're crying . Both of us . We 're holding each other and crying . Because of the baby . Because it 's so sad . We 're saying things we would never ordinarily say . We 're revealing amazing things from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pickle up his bum and I 've got a pickle up my bum and there 's a new kind of Berlin Wall between us . When do we get to the lovey-dovey part ? And what about those great revelations ? But . . . HE But what ? SHE But how do you feel ? HE How do I feel ? SHE Yes . HE Concerned . SHE Concerned ? HE Yes , I 'm very concerned about all this . Should n't I be ? p. 14 SHE I do n't know if I want you to be concerned . HE What do you want me to be ? SHE I do n't know , I just . . . HE You wanted to know what I thought . SHE Yes , it 's just . . . HE And I told you . . . SHE I know , it 's . . . HE What ? SHE I feel like this has happened for a reason , the timing is . . . I ca n't tell you , it 's like I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something and it happened . HE The cap did n't work . SHE But why now ? I 've been dreaming . . . I wanted it somehow . HE Well , the next time you 're moved to put the cap in sideways , I wish you 'd let me know . SHE Death is too good for him . Murder too gentle . I am a giant ice-pick . I am a study in scorn . I am covered with shards of broken glass , dirty flint designed to cause infected wounds that fester and cause limbs to be hacked off in muddy , field hospitals with no anesthetic , not even a bullet to bite . He 's screaming now as the saw cuts into his thigh . Excuse me , I have to go to the bathroom . p. 15 HE That was wrong . I can tell that was wrong . She did n't take it well , not well at all . It was supposed to be a joke . Maybe not a complete joke , some irony then to lighten the situation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a pregnancy , not a New Age phenomena . All that thinking confuses her , but I ca n't be confused . There 's not a confused bone in my body . I can see it 's time for sensitivity . I 've got to pour on the sensitivity . Maybe I 'm not understanding you , explain it to me . SHE The frost is so thick he 'll never get through . It 's not unknown , even in scientific circles , that thoughts can affect the body . It is possible to subconsciously desire something and have that thought result in a physical effect . But I assure you that I 've never done anything to make this come about in a practical sense . I 've always been very careful about birth control , always used protection , always made sure to check it . HE She sounds like a nurse who 's just killed the patient . SHE I was on the pill for seven years , three doctors told me they would n't put an IUD in someone who had n't had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a condom , they say they ca n't feel anything , you said that , so the cervical cap was a reasonable alternative . Cervical dunce cap , there were times I 'd check the bloody thing in the morning and it would be upside down . p. 16 HE I 'm sorry . I know you 've been careful . SHE Tell me what you 're feeling . HE Well , concerned . SHE Never go out with a guy with a great record collection . HE I 'm trying to be plain . I think that 's what 's best now , even if it 's hard . It 's afterwards that I 'm thinking about . There 'll be morning sickness for a few months , then carrying the weight of it for another few months , then hours or days of screaming bloody agony and that 's only the beginning . What about after ? SHE You 're younger than I am . It makes a difference . HE Are n't you tired ? SHE No . HE I 'm sorry I 'm not more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for . . . anything you want . If you want to wake me up in the middle of the night . . . SHE Let 's just go to bed . HE She does n't want me to hold her but I can / hold her so beautifully . . . SHE I do n't want him to hold me / but he 's holding me . . . HE I can feel it , drawing it out / of her . . . p. 17 SHE Making the nausea go / away , so beautiful . . . HE I would feel it if I could , I 'd rather I felt it than her / let me feel it . . . SHE Like his / fingers had suction cups . . . HE I can give her something , I can really / give something . . . SHE He feels guilty and bad , / his arms are silk . Do n't go away . . . HE It 's not fair she has to go through this , / it 's not fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE I 'm going to finish the rest of that piece today , get it over with this weekend . SHE Death is too good for him . ( Telephone conversation . ) HE But I thought you wanted to be alone . SHE I want us to go through this together . HE You did n't want to be alone ? SHE Maybe a bit , but then I did n't . HE You 've got to tell me . All the women I 've been with wanted to be alone all the time . I had to learn  --  " give them room . " p. 18 SHE I want this to mean something , be a way for us to talk , I want to know what you 're feeling . HE I was trying to be plain . SHE I want to know all the contradictions , the feelings , I want to tell you mine . This will either break us apart , or make us closer than we ever would have been . HE Then you have to tell me things , like when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHE Okay , I will . HE I 'm cancelling my plans for tonight . Let 's go out to dinner and talk . SHE I did n't know there 'd be so many mosquitoes . Look at that one . They love me , all that fresh flesh . HE Do n't scratch . If you do n't scratch right away they wo n't itch . That 's a law of nature . ( He sneezes . ) SHE Oh , great , I bring you out here so we can talk and you turn into a city nerd . HE I love the country . Sorry about that restaurant , I just got claustrophobic . You want to know how I feel , it 's hard to talk about how you feel , I do n't know if I 'm any good at it . Ouch ! That one took a chunk out of me. p. 19 SHE Do you want to go inside ? HE No , it 's fine . It 's going to get dark soon . SHE Does it matter ? HE No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHE I want to scratch so badly . . . HE You have to use willpower . SHE I do n't think I believe in willpower any more . HE About this whole business , I look at it all so differently than you , I do n't believe in souls , or God . I hate it when people turn to religion as a way to get out of their own lives . I believe this is the life you have , no other , that you have to live it fully , deal with it , not turn to some big God up in the sky who 's going to make it all better . SHE That 's not what I think . HE I 'm a pagan . SHE Pagans believe in something . HE You ca n't say " believe , " you can say " have faith , " but you ca n't say " believe . " SHE ( Singing . ) You say tomato , I say tomahto , tomato , tomahto , potato , potahto . . . p. 20 HE All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing up . HE All right , I believe in this life . SHE This life ? HE My life , our lives , not a bit of protoplasm that is n't conscious yet . SHE You ca n't be a pagan . HE All right , then I 'm an atheist . Maybe I do n't know what I am , that 's one of the things I 'd like to do this year , study up on this whole area . SHE But I 'm pregnant now . HE All right , what 's a pagan ? SHE Okay , what I believe is . . . HE Not to interrupt you , but I 'm getting eaten alive , let 's walk over here . SHE Okay . They 're playing baseball . It looks like something out of Apocalypse Now . In the middle of the jungle . . . HE The depot , the eerie light on the dancing girls . . . SHE I 've always hated sports and games . HE Me too . Except chess . p. 21 SHE Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . okay , if I look up in the sky . . . HE Do n't . That 's what I hate , do n't look up in the sky . SHE All right . But I believe in . . . something . HE What ? SHE Like a feeling . HE What kind of feeling ? SHE A feeling of . . . things in the air . HE Like ghosts ? Poltergeists ? Pollen ? SHE Do n't . HE Sorry . SHE Like a feeling of . . . dreams and memory and . . . time and how it interrelates with . . . all that stuff about quantum physics . . . no , it 's about that door , that door deep inside your stomach and it opens up and you feel nauseous and you feel other . . . realms . . . other frequencies playing on your life . . . like light and time and quantum physics . . . you 're a little girl in church , feeling things they were n't talking about , imagining beings everywhere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them and they could talk to you . . . things , objects having power because they 've been somewhere and retained or changed energy and you hold them in your hand and all of a sudden the top of your head is coming right off and you 're thinking things you would never otherwise have thought . . . and . . . never doubting that " that feeling " would come if you called it . I 'm not saying I 've got it all figured out . p. 22 HE Sorry , I turned off somewhere after quantum physics . It 's like you 're explaining the most dangerous kinds of superstition as if science supported . . . as if it 's some kind of way forward for mankind . It 's like , you know when people say , " The last five times you called , I was thinking about you just before ? " Well , what about the fifty times you called and they were n't thinking of you ? It 's a trap . I can see meditation , I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I started to laugh every time I said it . SHE So you abort your child and that 's it . HE Do n't do that . That 's not what I said . Of course not , it 's hard , and painful . . . SHE But it has to be done , so bite the bullet old chap and . . . HE I have my position . SHE I 'm not talking about subscribing to the Pro Choice newsletter . HE I 've dealt with these issues . SHE There 's no question about the basic rights but I have a question about . . . HE Many things start and never get finished . I do n't want to go on about " freedom . " I know it exists in different ways , but it 's something they 've written about through the ages and I 've never had any . Always tried to be successful , tried to keep up , and now I 'm stopping . I 've dreamt of quitting that job for eons , and in four days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on my novel , travel , paint , take Japanese . . . change my apartment . . . I do n't know . . . be free . It 's like I 've been going down this long road , and I 'm just smelling the sea , my head 's exploding with plans and ideas and . . . p. 23 SHE I know . It 's appalling timing . HE You could say that . SHE And you 're younger than me . HE Not that much . SHE Younger . It counts . But you do n't find that odd ? That just when you have it all worked out in your head , some curve ball like this comes along ? HE It 's an accident . There 's no plan out there that makes everything mean something . SHE I do n't think I believe in accidents . I needed to know something . Either way I needed to know something . HE What ? SHE It 's not like that . HE Like what ? SHE It 's not a what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . HE That 's just fuzzy thinking . SHE Okay . HE You ca n't just say " Okay . " SHE Yes I can . I can just say " Okay . " HE And do I just sit back and wait for the verdict ? p. 24 SHE Let 's keep it going . HE It 's not a game . SHE We 've got to keep it going , like a ball in the air , keep the balloon up until something changes . Until some purpose is clear . It 's not really bad timing for me , it 's terrible timing for you . Excuse me . ( SHE turns away , her hand on her mouth . ) HE Are you all right ? SHE Yes I 'm fine . HE Did you eat something bad ? SHE No . HE Are you getting the flu ? SHE No . HE Oh . SHE Let 's keep it going . HE Maybe we should stop . SHE I ca n't stop . HE All right . Raising a child is about good timing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had a father . A child needs a mother and a father . SHE You get screwed up some way , I 'm screwed up because I had a mother and a father . . . ohhh look at that light , not like a sunset exactly . Magic time , that 's what they call it in the movies . Oh , sorry , fuzzy thinking . p. 25 HE Okay , you want to talk about learning things . Now I know I 'd like to have kids someday , I did n't know that for sure before . But I think a child needs to be cared for . I know this may sound corny but I think of it like the Darling family in Peter Pan , you know , the Walt Disney version ? That Victorian house with the nursery ? SHE The dog with the apron and Mr. and Mrs. Darling and they 're going out and he ca n't fix his tie and he 's pissed off . . . HE The nursery is all set up for those kids , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know it . SHE And they fly out the window to become pirates and never go home . HE But they do go home . SHE Oh yeah , all except Peter Pan . HE I always thought I was Peter Pan . SHE I always thought I was . Maybe I just tell it to go away . Paula said she talked to it the night before , saying , " Next time , next time . " HE That 's the difference between us , I do n't think there 's an " it " to tell anything to . SHE All my friends who 've had abortions say , " It would have been five . " But like a question though , " It would have been eight ? " It does n't mean regret , not necessarily . If you 've never had one , you feel kind of superior . You 're all for the politics and all that , but deep down , you feel like you 'd never actually do it . . . until it happens and . . . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as fully as I can , being a man . And I think , do I marry her and have people counting on their fingers ? SHE People have n't counted on their fingers in twenty years . HE People will always be counting on their fingers . SHE What people ? You mean your family ? HE I do n't just mean my family . SHE You 're afraid to have your family know , in this day and age . . . HE Are n't you afraid to have your family know ? SHE If I really wanted this child , it would be easy , if I was sure . I could face down my family , friends , people . It would be in the greater cause , a noble thing , me , alone with my big belly facing the world . " Yes I want this child . No , the father does n't want it , but I want it . I believe in life . " HE It 's like the invasion of the body snatchers , your zeal . SHE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I feel it .

SHE Look at the moon . Almost full , like me , almost full . HE Yeah . She looks at the moon and thinks of the child , I look at the moon and think of escape .

HE No . She 's not like that . She 's operating on a higher plane . I 'm the selfish one . She stands for life and I stand for pragmatism . / Disappointing . I 'm disappointed in myself , hate that feeling . SHE But what he wants has to influence me about what I want . Does n't it ? HE It 's like a nail being driven into my chest . Must have exercised too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to build up slowly . Ohhh Jesus that hurts . It 's not a heart attack . The last time it happened they said my heart was fine . Acid in the stomach .

HE They were fine , really . They gave me that inflatable Paul McCartney over there . You could see they were still a bit pissed off I was leaving , but they were fine , really . So easy to end up forty with that hurt look in your eyes . SHE No more day job . Hard to believe . HE It feels great . Do you want wine , beer , brandy . . . SHE I 'll just take bubbly water .

We should get there early , there 'll probably be a line-up . SHE Right . HE Enough of this lolling about . SHE I 'm just learning to loll about . HE I guess I sound . . . SHE Yeah . HE Private school does it to you , especially where I went , you try to rebel but if they get you at six years old , you 're pretty well moulded . " Never explain , never complain . " Remember when we first met , I said I wanted to learn to be more vulnerable ? p. 31 SHE Yes . HE I thought you could teach me , that you were vulnerable . SHE Did you ? HE Yes . SHE It 's just that you sounded like you had a list and vulnerable was on it . HE Look at this place . No life . It looks like I 've had a day-job for fifteen years . It needs to be fixed up , new things , new looks , new life . The walls are boring , I should get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE Great , she calls my bluff . All right , I will . That 's all I need , for the landlord to come in , throw me out of here . . . here we go . What should I do ? SHE Whatever you want . Talk to me , just talk to me . HE You 'd have my child , but you do n't even like me . I want to write something that will remind me of the new life I 'm starting , so I 'll never go backwards . But it has to be done fully , the right colours , the right look , I do n't want to be living with something ugly . . . maybe I should just forget it .

SHE You do n't believe in magic . HE Our subconscious may be magical , that makes sense to me . I have a Tarot pack wrapped in yellow silk . I went out with a Hungarian countess who said she had the sight and used to want to make love on people 's front lawns . I love Hallowe'en and Frankenstein . If it leads her down there , maybe it 's wrong , maybe she should n't be down there . Maybe she likes being down there too much . It may not be such a dark tortured thing . After all , the origin of it is random . Life is n't sacred , when is it sacred in nature ? I know what I want . HE Any new thoughts ? I 'm trying not to lean on you , trying not to load you down .

I know what it makes sense to do , but I ca n't make it feel right . I 've been wandering for a long time with no limitations , and it would be such a relief to say , " Sorry , I ca n't do it , I 've got a kid . " HE What kind of way ? SHE Like we would n't have to live together , we could just go on the way we 've been . You have your own place and work there , and stay over sometimes . HE I can just see myself , with you getting more and more visibly pregnant , coming over to visit and saying , " Hi , how 're you doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or help her through what could be a difficult pregnancy and then leave town ? That 's how bad it gets . SHE Sometimes I wish you were a one-night stand and did n't have any feelings and would just go away . p. 36 HE That 's what really bothers me . The way you talk about it , as if it has no rights . I ca n't go along with your seat-of-the-pants ideas about raising a child . The more I think about it the more I know I 'd want money for a child , and a good place to live , and planning and ideas about schools and . . . SHE What seat-of-the-pants ideas ? HE Ad hoc child-raising . Some romantic idea of solving your life with a child . SHE I turned down a twenty-thousand-dollar job last month , a choice I would reverse if I had a reason to do things just for money . I have a strong community of friends that I value . The child would n't be without some very strong male models . I think I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very traditional mother , but I think I have something to offer a child . I may act like I do n't really have a hold on things . But I 've got money in my RSP account , and I do keep it together in the regular world . HE Yes you do . And I 'm nowhere near that . I 'm just beginning . Maybe in a few years , if everything works out with us , there 's a possibility for children then . SHE But there 's no guarantee of that . HE No . Are you all right ? p. 37 SHE Yeah , it 's just that chemotherapy feeling . HE Is there anything I can do ? SHE Just go to sleep . HE When I look in the mirror , I see a boy 's face . In a couple of years , it 'll be a man 's . SHE Why not now ? SHE I just have to get through the archway . . . I 'm on my hands and knees kind of pushing back and forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heave and hea  --  HE Wake up . SHE What ? HE You were talking in your sleep . SHE What did I say ? HE I do n't know , I could n't make out a word . HE My mother is my best friend . SHE Then why ca n't you tell her ? SHE Hello ? HE Hi , it 's me . SHE Hi . HE Has it been a hard day ? SHE Sort of . p. 38 HE Would you like to go to a movie tomorrow night ? SHE I 'll have to see how I feel . HE Are you feeling all right ? SHE I can never tell when it 's going to hit me . HE You know you can call me any time , / wake me up , even in the middle of the night . SHE I know . Thanks . / Well , I better let you go . HE I 'll see you tomorrow . SHE Bye . HE Bye . SHE Hello ? HE Hi , it 's me . SHE Hi . HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HE Constipated , pains in my stomach , in my chest . SHE Sick as a dog , I nearly passed out in the bank today . HE I ca n't stand it when you tell me things like that . SHE Do n't worry , I 'll probably " arrest the foetus . " I 'm just dragging it out for the fun of it , and to watch you squirm. p. 39 HE You do n't know how good I 'm being to you , I call every day . SHE You do n't know how good I 'm being to you , I could fuck you good . HE All this trouble from one fuck . SHE Hard to fucking believe . SHE Jim would have it . HE Who 's Jim ? SHE I could just go up to him and say , " Listen , I 'm pregnant and I need a father . Let 's live together and give it a go . " That 's the way I feel right now . Fuck it . Do you really think you 'll find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all work out to your advantage ? I could have a good life with him . Very Victorian is n't it ? " We did n't exactly love each other at first , but time passed and something changed . . . " A good life . With a good man . HE Now I know how they get strangled . You do n't think he 'd be put off by a potential mother with five therapists who has to hang signs saying " breathe " around her apartment in case she forgets ? SHE No . HE Someone who needs eleven hours ' sleep and takes two hours to get out of bed in the morning ? p. 40 SHE I can get out of bed if I want to . HE Someone who ca n't go to sleep at night without the light on , who eats Valium like candy , with inexplicable pains , insomnia , flus that do n't go away for months . . . SHE People change . HE Those things would n't happen when you carry this child ? SHE No . HE They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're postnatally depressed and exhausted ? And there 's not enough money to get a babysitter and it 's no longer cool to have a child , and you ca n't work at home and there 's no one to help . . . SHE And I have n't slept in days and I 'm sitting on the floor crying with the baby in my arms crying and the place smells like shit and urine and the floor is crusty with spit and apple juice and crackers and I 've already called all my friends for a thousand emergencies and the last guy just left because he wanted someone with no attachments and the kid is ugly and looks like neither of us and they think there 's something wrong with him , and there 's no one no one no one , and I 'm banging my head against the wall then I take the kid to do the same thing . . . HE Stop it . There 's nothing down there but dirt and hate and craziness. p. 41 SHE Do n't try to out-imagine me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't been . HE You 've never even looked at me . I ca n't bear to have my own child born . How dark is that ? SHE Tell someone . HE I ca n't . SHE A friend , an enemy , a total stranger . HE I ca n't . I 'm not that kind of person . HE Are you talking to that therapist about this ? SHE I ca n't help it . But I 'm very wary . If he shows signs of moral judgement , I get pissed off and back away . HE So am I in competition with him ? SHE I do n't think we should think in terms of competition . HE Sorry , I just . . . what do I do ? Wait for the verdict ? SHE We talk about it . We talk about it until we ca n't talk any more . SHE Tell me what you feel . . . HE This is where they get you . SHE That 's all I want to know , what you feel / tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to suck you dry of all your secrets . SHE Let me know that you have doubts , then it / will be better . . . HE She 's dying for it , dying to have me tell her about my childhood . . . SHE It 's too awful thinking you / have no doubts . . . HE She wants the hurt places , she wants the scrapes the scars the wounds the memories that bite and claw , she wants the dirt . Then she 'll probe in there for a reason why she should have it . SHE I could walk to that abortion singing , if you let it in . Say it 's with / regret you see me go . HE Maybe there 's no underlying anything to me . Maybe I 'm a dry well of self-conscious tragedy . I just do n't want a child right now ! SHE What are you thinking ? HE I 'm thinking that I have no control . SHE Are you kidding ? I 'm not really a free spirit , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think . You 've got much too much control . SHE I do n't know why I fucked anyone . I do n't know why I fucked him . You hold them off for four weeks and they 're moaning , " How can you be so cruel ? Why ca n't you let me in ? " Four weeks , if you 're lucky , to decide . Then the night comes and you both know and somebody lights a candle . And there 's a great couple of days when you lie around in bed and touch and talk , and go to the bathroom with the door open . I love that part . And I pay for it . Because then they become " them . " I 'm twelve years old , I do n't want anyone to put that inside me . I only want a father , to play with and to hold me , to tell stories , to have fun . I only want a father , not a lover , not a boyfriend , not a baby .

HE I hate the thought of touching , do n't want to touch anything , do n't like the smell of food who am I that I ca n't come through what kind of selfish prig am I that I ca n't come through , tell me what you 're thinking , I 'm here for you tell me what you 're thinking I 'll phone you every day tell me what you 're thinking / tell me what you 're feeling tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what you 're thinking tell me what you 're feeling , tell me what you 're thinking . . .

I 'm pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant pregnant . HE How are you today ? p. 44 SHE Fine . Okay , a little weird . HE How do you mean , weird ? SHE It 's been a hard , day , that 's all . HE It 's ridiculous , I ca n't get away from it . SHE I know . I 've never seen so many pregnant women waddling around . Or babies . HE Everywhere I look . Did you see the cover of the National Enquirer this week ? SHE " Two-headed woman becomes pregnant . One head wants it , the other does n't . " HE It 's a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know who I 'm speaking to , goddess , god , spirits , trees , all the books I 've read . God . God of my childhood . For the first time , I asked you to heal me , and then I got pregnant . It seems that having this child would heal me , but I think that 's not quite right . I know this is a gift . A gift . Do n't let me twist it around . Heaven above , heaven below . I feel you , all the space around me , within me , the universe we know and the universe beyond , all the energy of all there is . Do I have your gift sucked out of me or is it your gift that it 's sucked out so I will finally be empty ? Is it your gift for me to know this death ? Or is this moment your gift ? Heaven above , heaven below . Accept the gift . That 's all I know . p. 45 HE Semen semen semen , spread all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost semen , lost cocks of lost fathers of lost children without fathers . Boys at school laughing , but who is your father ? What is your name ? Everyone knows the name comes from the father like the semen comes from the father , like heaven is ruled over by the Father . Dad ? You out there ? I 'm going to start it all again . I need a father . Dad ? I want to talk to you , Dad . Let 's have a father-son talk . Are you there ? Where were you to say , " This child is mine " ? This boy is mine . I am a male and this is my male child . No , you could n't claim me , you could n't claim that horror . I repeat the cycle , the circle , if she has it . To you my child , I hand down my hole in the guts . A legacy . I know exactly how it will feel , I know exactly how you will feel . Very specific feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts . And you will live as I have lived , and one day you will turn and run . Because you were handed down a hole , a pain , a lost cock never there , never waiting , never wanting . The cock that wanted to fuck but not to breed . And if I stay , you 'll know , and if I leave , you 'll know . And I 'll know , and she 'll know . Do n't do it . Do n't do it . Do n't do it . SHE There 's no such thing as rock and roll . HE What ? SHE There 's no such thing as rock and roll . There 's no such thing as The Beatles . p. 46 HE I would n't go that far . SHE Of course not .

SHE I 've done every conceivable kind of . . . HE All that phoney gentleness , punk is angry . SHE Punk is dead . HE I was one of the first to say punk is dead , but it exposed all that wishy-washy hippie bullshit , brought it back to anger . Kids understand that today , they 're angry . p. 47 SHE I finally figured out your routine , I saw this phrase in a trendy magazine , and I understood . " World Fusion Trip-hop Punk . " HE That 's already outdated . SHE Not on enough for the brave new world ? HE Well , I finally understood your little routine , you 've already made the appointment , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean . . . HE Then what the fuck have you been putting us through this for ? SHE I thought I should make it right away so we could cancel if we decided . . . like a fail-safe . . . HE You lied , you 've been lying all along . SHE So I would n't be walking around for a month with it growing larger and then make the appointment and then wait and . . . HE " I want us to go through this together , it 'll make us closer . " But you 've got something up your sleeve . . . SHE I wanted to go through every thought , I wanted  --  HE What ? SHE Contact . p. 48 HE You made your decision the minute you heard , did n't you ? SHE It was n't like that . Yes , I thought I should make the appointment right away but I really thought that we might be cancelling that appointment , I did n't know , I still do n't know . . . HE Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not the first minute , but the minute after . You 're right . I 'm a liar , somewhere I am a liar . HE Stop being so noble , get angry . Hate me . SHE I do n't hate you . HE I think you do , right now , I think you do . SHE No . HE Say it . SHE Okay , I hate you . HE I ca n't get hold of you , there 's something . . . SHE What ? HE Two-faced . SHE I hate you . I hate you . You 're such a pompous fake . I hate you . I hate men . Say it , say what we 're going to do . It 's a four-letter word . Say it . HE I do n't know what you  --  p. 49 SHE Yes you do . Say it . HE Kill . SHE Killing is a part of things . Of everything there is ? HE Yes . SHE Do you believe that 's true ? HE Yes . Do you ? SHE Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHE Fuck off . HE What 's that ? SHE It 's the instructions the doctor gave me . All the things you 're supposed to do . HE Are you doing it because I bullied you into it ? SHE No . I just ca n't believe you 're not sorry . Is he / going to give in ? Give in . . . HE Do n't dare move . . . SHE Give in , say you / regret it . . . HE I do n't regret / it . . . SHE Say " it , " say there 's an it . / Say you 're sorry , say you 're sorry . . . HE There 's no " it . " / I 'm sorry for you . Sorry for . . . p. 50 SHE You think I would grab onto one tiny word ? HE Yes . SHE You 're right . HE Do you want this child ? SHE No . Look at the rainbows . The prism makes them such a funny shape , kind of fat . HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're trying to communicate with us . HE Beep , beep beep beep . . . SHE Beep beep , take us to your leader . . . beep beep beep . HE Beep beep beep . ( They hold each other . ) SHE Last night I dreamt of a little boy , toddler-sized , all bundled up in a red snowsuit . I only saw his back , he was just walking away . I think I made that appointment a long long time ago . When you became the father , I started to see you , I think I see you now . HE Once I asked my mother 's friend , " Do you know where my father is ? " I was four years old . And they found him and made him visit me . I was insane with joy . But he could n't look at me . He sat around with the friends who had brought him and played cards . I kept running into the kitchen to look at him . He 'd turn around and go , " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't . Could n't look and could n't talk . Just an introverted kind of person with his own problems , how could he relate to me ? I went into the bedroom and bent over by the bed , laid my head down on the covers . I stayed there till they found me and made me throw darts at a board . Somewhere in all that time , he left . Music helped . I was the guy drinking beer with the bands backstage because I likened their lyrics to Proust . My head is full of trivia about who played bass with The Cramps and why Johnny Rotten learned to play piano . But how long is a generation in that world ? Two years . Because in two years you neither know nor truly care what bands are starting out anymore . It helped , but it 's a trap if you 're not in the band . You 're either in the band or out of the band . p. 51 SHE I thought you were a candidate . HE Please do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE We should get to a seven-thirty show so we can get to bed at a reasonable hour . I think that 's best . SHE Okay . HE What do you want to see ? SHE Nothing too . . . HE No . SHE Something . . . HE Yeah . . . nothing too . . . SHE There must be something good on like that . HE There must be . There 's Your Turn Now at seven-fifteen . SHE What 's that about ? HE It 's a British film about a father who beats his children . SHE No . . . HE Well , there 's Cock and Bull Story , you wanted to see that . SHE Yeah , I know , I just do n't know if it 's too . . . HE It 's not really that violent , all the violence is at the beginning . p. 52 SHE But you 've already seen it . HE I do n't mind . He 's gay and his lover kills him but it 's really about their relationship . SHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five movies we could see , they 're all at the same place . . . HE They 're all at different times , though , we 'd end up waiting around and I do n't think you 're up to that . SHE No . Actually , I did want to see Cock and Bull Story and if it 's a good movie , it 's a good movie , right ? I mean , it will feel good to see something good as opposed to something light that 's not good . That never really makes you feel good . HE Then it 's decided ? HE Somewhere someone is running into the other room , it 's someone like me but it is n't me . He 's saying , " No , stop , we 'll have it , we 'll work it out . It 's all right . " I hold my ear to her stomach the way everyone is doing , the way everyone is doing out there in the world , we do it too . But it 's not me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be easy , let there be no pain , let it be over . Whatever it is she believes in , let it protect us both . SHE Speak softly , to the little one , sea anemone , do n't be afraid to picture it , think of it , eight weeks ' worth . Say , I ask you to leave , flow out of me like rain like water like mucus like blood . This is such a short time for you . Become a memory for me . And a goal a goad , that life may be good , unshared by you . I am saying , " No child now . " This good girl will never be totally good again , I will know the dark eye of the Mother , carrying the balance of so much , but always so , always so , always so . I am an earthquake , I am a tidal wave , I am hail , and frost , I am the twisting volcano . I give up the act , I give it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give you up . Creator take you , sky enfold you , stars remember you . Tomorrow we will die . Go gentle into that good night . p. 53 HE I have tomorrow and the next day totally free . SHE I forgot to take off my underpants , they 're putting them in a brown paper bag with my name written on it . I wonder if they 'll remember to give them to me ? It does n't matter , I brought clean ones in my purse . My mother 's daughter . HE I forgot to buy mineral water . She 'll come home and be thirsty and want mineral water . I 've got everything else . Good things . Healthy things . Cheese and bread and fruit and yoghurt . SHE The anesthetist is looking at me carefully , telling me what he 's going to do . The nurse with the blonde ponytail is so different . Human and kind without being sucky . I just love her . She has the voice of an angel . HE I do n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind with the needle ? Do they still do it that way ? Do they put the needle right up ? Will she be awake ? Is she going to see it ? How much will it hurt ? Oh , let them do it to me . I 'd rather they did it to me . SHE She puts a needle in my hand , it 's longer than the other ones , and they leave it in. / The lights should be different . Too bright . HE It 's now , it 's happening now . SHE How will it be / when I wake up ? p. 54 HE What if something goes wrong ? SHE Sometimes people dry heave for hours / from the anesthetic . . . HE Sometimes they 're fine almost immediately . Sometimes they 're fine . SHE She tells me gently , " We 're adding the anesthetic to the IV now . " It 's mixed in with the liquid , moonstone white in its plastic bag . HE Tired , so tired I ca n't be tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping last night . . . SHE I can feel it coming , the room is whirling . . . HE The person says , " The last five times I thought of you , you called just after . " What about the fifty times that . . . SHE I 'm fighting it for a bit , so inevitable . ( SHE lights the sage , the smoke rises . ) Up , up so high , so far . . . HE Gentle . . . ( SHE smudges herself , HE smudges himself , she waves the smoke toward the audience . ) SHE Tell me that you love me . HE I love you . SHE I love you . ( SHE blots the sage . ) Are we grown up now ? ( Blackout . END OF PLAY. )
