<p> The threat of illness , and even death , from the so-called childhood diseases , measles , mumps , polio , whooping cough ( pertussis ) , and diphtheria , has been largely reduced because of vaccines . Cases of bacterial meningitis and hepatitis also stand to be reduced significantly with the recent introduction of wide-spread vaccination efforts . <p> Vaccines are the weakened form of small amounts of the organisms ( or of materials produced by those organisms ) that cause a disease . These vaccines are injected into the body or are taken by mouth . The body reacts by making disease-fighting substances  --  antibodies  --  that build up in the immune system and guard against these diseases for a long time . However , with any vaccine or drug , there is a possibility that a serious reaction , even death , could occur . <p> Many states and communities now require that all children receive these vaccines before they enter public school . Parents should consult a pediatrician or local health clinic to establish a schedule of immunizations for newborns and booster shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as polio , is an acute viral infection . In its more severe form , it invades the nervous system and causes paralysis . This can result in permanent disability , or death . <p> Although there are few cases of polio in the United States now , there are still many thousands of cases of polio each year in other countries . Therefore , it is important to protect children with vaccines so that they do n't get the disease when someone brings the virus into the United States from another country . <p> The best way to be protected against polio is to get four doses of polio vaccine . Most infants should get two doses by four months of age and a third dose at 15 to 18 months . The fourth dose is given at four to six years of age . <p> There are two types of polio vaccines . The live oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) uses a live polio virus that has been made very weak . This vaccine is given as drops in the mouth . The inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administered by an injection . <p> At least 90% of the people who get three or more doses of either vaccine will be protected against polio . For healthy children and teenagers up to their 18th birhtday , most experts recommend OPV drops rather than IPV shots . This is because the OPV is easier to take and more effective in preventing the spread of polio . <p> Adults traveling to foreign countries where polio is common should also get at least one dose of a vaccine . If an adult has never had OPV , the IPV should be administered . <p> Possible Side Effects . Although it happens rarely , paralysis after receiving the first dose of OPV occurs about once for every 1.5 million doses given . For the subsequent doses the risk of paralysis drops to one in 40 million doses given . People who come into contact with someone who receives the live vaccine also face a risk of about one in two million after the first dose and one in 14 million after later doses . Adults who will be exposed to vaccinated children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPV at the time or shortly after the child receives the oral vaccine . <p> The IPV can cause a little soreness and redness where the shot was given . As with any medicine or vaccination , there is a very rare chance that other serious problems or even death could occur after getting either vaccine . <p> Special Considerations . The IPV should be given in place of the live oral vaccine with anyone born with or who develops any disease that suppresses the immune system , such as cancer , leukemia , lymphoma , AIDS , or hypogammaglobulinemia . Treatment of such conditions by chemotherapy , radiation , or use of drugs such as prednisone or steroids also requires the use of IPV . And because the virus present in OPV drops can pass to other members of a household , doctors usually advise that if someone in the home has any of the conditions listed above , IPV should be used . <p> The IPV , however , should not be given to someone who has had a serious allergic reaction to the antibiotics neomycin or streptomycin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies , pregnant women should avoid the vaccination unless immediate protection is required . Diphtheria , Tetanus , Pertussis <p> Diphtheria is a very serious disease that can cause a skin infection , an infection in the nose and throat that can interfere with breathing , and in some cases heart failure or paralysis . About one out of every ten people who get diphtheria dies of it . <p> Tetanus , also known as lockjaw , results when wounds are infected with tetanus bacteria , which are often found in dirt . The bacteria in the wound make a poison that causes the muscles of the body to go into spasm and can prevent the victim from chewing and swallowing . Three out of every ten people who get tetanus die of it . <p> Pertussis , or whooping cough , causes severe spells of coughing that can interfere with eating , drinking , and breathing . It is easily passed from one person to another . In the United States , most reported pertussis cases occur in children younger than five years of age . Pertussis is a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under one year of age reported to have it are hospitalized . <p> In recent years , as many as 4,200 cases of pertussis have been reported annually in the United States . Complications occur in a substantial proportion of these cases . For instance , 16 of 100 infants who have the disease contract pneumonia . And two of every 100 develop convulsions . One out of 200 may develop long term problems of the brain . In recent years about one of every 100 babies with pertussis dies . <p> The vaccines to protect children younger than seven years against all three diseases are usually given together as one shot . This is called the diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis ( DTP ) vaccine , and is given by injection starting early in infancy . At least three shots are needed to provide initial protection . Young children should get three doses in the first six months of life and a fourth at between 15 and 18 months . Children who are about to enter school should be given a booster shot sometime between their fourth and sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 90% of children from getting pertussis if exposed to it , and usually protect children through the elementary school years . Those who are vaccinated and contract the disease usually have a milder form of it . The shots keep 85% of children from getting diptheria and 95% from getting tetanus for at least ten years . <p> A vaccine that contains no pertussis part and a lower concentration of the diphtheria part is called Td vaccine . Boosters of the Td vaccine should be received every 10 years throughout life . It is given to children older than seven years of age because reactions to the diphtheria part of the vaccine may be more common in older children . <p> A preparation called DT vaccine is available for children who have had a serious reaction to previous DTP shots . DT does not contain the pertussis vaccine . <p> Possible Side Effects . Within two days after getting the DTP shot , most children will have a slight fever and be irritable . One-half of children develop some soreness and swelling in the area where the shot was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious side effects such as the following : a temperature of 105 degrees F or greater , continuous crying lasting more than three hours , or unusual , high-pitched crying . One in every 1,750 shots results in convulsions or shock collapse ( the child becomes blue or pale and unresponsive ) . Children who have previously had a convulsion may be more likely to have another one after receiving the pertussis vaccine . <p> ( The chance of a child having a convulsion with fever after receiving DTP vaccine is up to nine times greater if the child has had a convulsion before . It is about three times greater if a parent or sibling has ever had a convulsion . It is usually the high fever that causes convulsions , and most experts agree that convulsions with fever do not cause any permanent damage to the child . ) <p> Permanent brain damage and death are considered very rare , but have been reported after getting DTP . However , according to the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services , , ( most experts now agree that DTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . If DTP ever causes brain damage , then such an event would be very rare . " There is no test that can tell in advance if your child will have any of these problems following DTP vaccination . <p> DT , Td , and T ( tenanus ) vaccines cause few problems . They may cause mild fever or soreness , swellng , and redness where the shot was given . These problems usually last for one to two days , but this does not happen nearly as often as with DTP vaccine . <p> Special Considerations . Your child should not get another DTP shot if any of the following happened after an earlier DTP and had no obvious cause . Serious problems of the brain within seven days after getting the shot . Serious allergic problems ( swelling of the mouth , throat , face , or difficulty breathing ) within a few hours after the shot . The presence of a brain problem that is getting worse , such as uncontrolled convulsions . <p> Many experts believe the child should not receive DTP if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some children the benefits might outweigh the risks , so talk with your physician . Temperature of 105 degrees F or higher within two days after getting DTP . Shock-collapse within two days after the shot . Convulsion within three days . Uncontrollable crying , lasting longer than three hours that occurs within two days after the shot . <p> Women who have not received Td earlier and who are thought to be at risk of delivering their babies under unsanitary conditions should be immunized during pregnancy to protect their newborn babies from tetanus . Td is not known to cause special problems for pregnant women or their unborn babies . Pregnant women who need Td should receive it , preferably during the second and/or third trimester . Doctors , however , usually do not recommend giving any drugs or vaccines to pregnant women , unless there is a specific need . Measles , Mumps , and Rubella <p> Measles is the most serious of common childhood diseases . Usually , it causes a rash , high fever , cough , runny nose , and watery eyes lasting one to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also get an ear infection or pneumonia . Approximately one child in 1,000 who gets measles develops an infection of the brain that can lead to convulsions , deafness , or mental retardation . About one in 750 children who get measles die from it . Measles can also cause a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage or give birth to a premature baby . <p> Mumps usually causes fever , headache , and inflammation of the salivary glands , which causes the cheeks to swell . Sometimes it is more serious , causing a mild inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) in about one child in every ten who get it . Swelling of the brain occurs in about one of every 200 cases and can result in the loss of hearing . About one in every four adolescent or adult men with the disease develops painful inflammation and swelling of the testicles . While this condition usually goes away , on rare occasions it may cause sterility . The disease is often more severe for adults , particularly men . <p> Rubella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes a slight fever , rash , and swelling of the glands in the neck . The sickness lasts about three days . Sometimes , especially in adult women , there may be swelling and aching of the joints for a week or two . <p> The most serious problem with rubella is that if a pregnant woman gets it , there is a good chance that she may have a miscarriage or that the baby will be born deaf , blind , or with other defects . Overall , one in ten women in the United States is not protected against rubella . <p> If children are not vaccinated , their risk of contracting one of these diseases is high . But , because of the use of vaccines , the number of cases of mumps and rubella is much lower ; measles has practically been eliminated . <p> The vaccines to protect against all three diseases are usually given together in a single injection , called the MMR ( measles , mumps , and rubella ) vaccine . One shot protects 90% to 98% of people who receive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of age , but sometimes it should be given at 12 months of age , or even earlier during an outbreak . To protect the few not protected by the first shot , a second MMR is recommended when the child enters school for the first time . It is estimated that people are probably protected for life with these vaccines , though health officials might recommend additional shots should measles break out locally . <p> Possible Side Effects . One or two weeks after receiving the measles vaccine , about one in 20 children will get a rash or serious fever lasting for a few days . Occasionally , mild swelling of the salivary glands develops after a mumps vaccination . <p> About one in seven children who receive the rubella vaccine will develop a rash or some swelling of the glands or neck one or two weeks after the shot . About one in 100 children will have some aching or swelling of the joints for two or three days . This may happen anywhere from one to three weeks after the shot . As many as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his joints . Other temporary side effects , such as pain , numbness , or tingling in the hands and feet , have also occurred but are very uncommon . <p> There is a rare possibility that children who get these vaccines may have a more serious reaction , such as encephalitis , convulsions from fever , or deafness . <p> Special Considerations . The MMR vaccine is not recommended for anyone who is sick with more than a cold , who is severely allergic to eggs or the antibiotic neomycin , who has cancer or lymphoma , who has an infection or takes drugs that lower resistance to infection , or who has been vaccinated with gamma globulin in the last three months . <p> Pregnant women should not get these vaccines unless there is a specific need . A woman who gets any of these vaccines should wait three months before getting pregnant . Haemophilus Influenza <p> Haemophilus influenza type b ( Hib ) , one of six types of flu strain , is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis . Hib can also cause other diseases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five are the major risk group . Serious disease is most common in children between six months and one year of age . About half of all Hib disease in children happens during the first year of life . <p> About one child in every 20 with meningitis caused by Hib dies of it and about one out of four has permanent brain damage . About one in every 200 children in the United States will have a moderate to severe disease caused by Hib before their fifth birthday . <p> There are several types of licensed Hib vaccines available for use . All are considered to be effective , not all are approved for use in infants . More than 90% of children who receive two or three injections of the vaccine become protected . The Hib vaccine does not protect against meningitis caused by other bacteria . <p> All children should be vaccinated beginning at age two months . Unvaccinated children between 11/2 and five years of age should receive a single dose . Those older than five generally do not need inocculation . <p> Possible Side Effects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms are common and subside in less than 24 hours . High fever has been reported in less than 1% of vaccine recipients . As with any vaccine , there is a remote possiblity that other serious problems , even death , could occur . <p> Special Considerations . The vaccine should not be administered to anyone sick with more than a cold , anyone who has had a serious reaction to products containing thimerosal , and anyone who has had a serious reaction to the diptheria vaccine . Hepatitis B <p> Each year more than 240,000 people get hepatitus B in the United States . The disease is caused by the highly infectious virus infection and can lead to severe illness , liver damage , and in some cases death . Each year 5,000 people in the United States die of cirrhosis of the liver related to hepatitis B , and another 1,500 die of liver cancer related to the virus . <p> No cure is available for hepatitis B , so prevention is crucial . Vaccines provide protection in more than 90% of healthy adults who are inoculated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Vaccination is recommended for all infants , whether or not their mothers have tested positive for the virus . The series of three doses can be incorporated into the normal vaccination schedules for newborns , see chart , page 27 . ( For infants at high risk of contracting the virus , the first dose should be administered within 12 hours of birth . ) <p> Possible Side Effects . Pain at the injection site and fever are the most frequently reported side effects . In adults Guillain-Barre syndrome has been repated after the first dose , but is considered rare  --  about one in one million vaccinees  --  and no deaths have been reported . No severe reactions have been reported in infants or children , though existing data are limited .
