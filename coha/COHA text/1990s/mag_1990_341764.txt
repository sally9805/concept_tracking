MONROVIA  --  The civil war in Liberia is about hatred : personal hatred based on political rivalry , brutally used to turn tribe against tribe . Charles Taylor , head of the rebel National Patriotic Liberation Front , and President Samuel Doe , the harsh ruler of the country 's 2.5 million people for the past decade , loathe each other . Says Taylor : " The only good Doe is a dead Doe . " In the past eight months Taylor 's 10,000-member army has overrun most of the country , leaving only small pieces of Monrovia , the capital , in Doe 's control and setting the Gio tribe , which supports Taylor , against one of Liberia 's smallest but most powerful tribes , Doe 's people , the Krahn . <P> Few soldiers or rebels have died in battle , but thousands of civilians have perished . Two weeks ago , two bodies lay by the side of the road leading to a Monrovia airport , hands tied behind their backs . A third man , denying he was a Krahn , pleaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Creating yet more violence , Prince Yormie Johnson , a Gio , split away from Taylor last February . By the summer , Johnson and his few hundred men had swept into the center of the capital , taking on both Doe 's and Taylor 's forces . <P> Last week , in an effort to halt the tribal carnage , 3,000 troops of a five- nation West African peacekeeping force began to fan out in besieged Monrovia ( pop . 500,000 ) . Doe and Johnson welcomed the troops , but Taylor , challenging their legitimacy , vowed to kill them all . If the fighting can not be stopped , the attempted overthrow of Doe could threaten the stability of the whole West Africa region . Already , the intervention has ignited bitter controversy among Liberia 's neighbors . <P> Taylor is unimpressed by outside efforts to calm the civil strife . " I am not going to roll over and play dead , " he told TIME . " This is an attempt to rescue Doe . A peacekeeping force means all sides agree . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be expensive . The world is going to remember . " <P> Most of the world has paid little attention to the war , and Liberia 's neighbors are only belatedly showing concern . When the Economic Community of West African States , a 16-nation body formed 15 years ago to promote regional cooperation , held an emergency summit in early August , only seven members bothered to attend . Determined to solve their problems without the help of uninterested superpowers , they hastily decided that ECOWAS should go into the peacekeeping business . To achieve a cease-fire in Liberia and supervise free elections , they created a West African force , the Economic Community Monitoring Group . Yet when the time came to pass out white ECOMOG helmets , only five countries sent troops : Nigeria , Ghana , Guinea , Sierra Leone and Gambia . <P> Taylor does not trust any of them . " Peacekeeping ? " he scoffs . " We 've arrested Guinean soldiers here in Liberia . How can they come to keep the peace ? We 've captured Nigerian weapons from Doe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and say he has come to make the peace ? ECOWAS is going to make this another Vietnam  --  a war that never ends .
