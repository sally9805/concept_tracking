A reissue of the band 's quirky 1975 single Bohemian Rhapsody ( currently featured in the hit movie Wayne 's World ) is a best seller in both the U.S. and Britain , while three of Queen 's old albums are now on the Billboard oldies chart . This week many of the singer 's rock cohorts will gather at London 's Wembley Stadium for " A Concert for Life , " which will be televised worldwide to benefit AIDS research .
