<p> The Republican drive to choke off the flow of cash from organized labor to liberal candidates and causes has hit a huge roadblock in its crucial test on the June 2 California ballot . <p> Support for the " Paycheck Protection " initiative , which would require an annual , written authorization from each union member for political use of any dues money , has eroded from an early lead of more than 2 to 1 to the point it may not pass . <p> The outcome has national importance for both parties . Labor has been the biggest single contributor to Democratic campaigns , investing at least $ 119 million in the last election cycle . President Clinton and Vice President Gore both denounced Proposition 226 , as it is known , in California appearances . House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , who blames the 1996 union ads for wrecking his approval score and almost costing the GOP control of the House , has campaigned for " Paycheck Protection " from coast to coast . <p> Gov . Pete Wilson ( R ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its approval , blamed the turnabout on an " avalanche " of negative radio and television ads , mailings and phone calls from labor . " Ironically , they are attempting to black out the truth by using the same abusive , corrupt technique of checkoff without consent that this initiative would stop , " Wilson said in an interview . " But I think people will see through it and we will win . " <p> Private tracking polls show Proposition 226 dropping close to or even below 50 percent after enjoying initial support from more than 70 percent of the voters . A Los Angeles Times poll reported Saturday that the initiative is supported by 51 percent of the likely voters and opposed by 37 percent . <p> National labor officials have said that stopping the initiative is one of their top priorities and have poured almost $ 20 million into the effort . <p> The " Paycheck Protection " cause has been hampered by disputes among its early backers and by the unwillingness of major California business organizations to go to the mat against labor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposition 226 would be duplicated across the country . <p> Going into the closing drive , opponents outspent Proposition 226 backers $ 11 million to $ 1 million on broadcast advertising . Wilson recently loaned Californians for Paycheck Protection $ 550,000 from his own political action committee to help pay for a closing TV drive . Overall , Wilson has supplied almost two-thirds of the $ 1.9 million that the committee has taken in . A separate " Yes on 226 " committee conducting a grass-roots campaign for the initiative reported receipts of only $ 214,576 . The combined total of $ 2.1 million is dwarfed by the $ 19.3 million reported by five labor and teachers ' groups opposing the initiative . <p> Two outside groups , Citizens for a Sound Economy and the National Taxpayers Union , have been on the air with " educational " campaigns on workers ' rights . Because their ads do not expressly advocate a yes vote , they can be financed through tax-exempt foundations and the two groups do n't have to report what was spent on them . NTU President John Berthoud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The push for the initiative began in California last year with three Orange County business executives and conservative activists , all supporters of school vouchers , who had been bruised by their encounters with teachers ' unions in their fight for control of local school boards . <p> The campaign was going nowhere until it attracted the attention of some heavy hitters who had their own scores to settle with the unions . The first was J. Patrick Rooney , an Indianapolis insurance company owner who calls himself a supporter of individual and civil rights . Rooney is a major backer of school vouchers , which were defeated in California after an expensive opposition campaign led by the California Teachers Association . He also has clashed with unions nationally over his plan for medical savings accounts as a variant on Medicare . <p> Rooney gave almost $ 50,000 to jump-start the signature-gathering campaign and persuaded Wilson to become chairman of the drive . He also enlisted Grover Norquist , whose Washington-based group , Americans for Tax Reform , is an unofficial coordinating committee for national conservative causes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Wilson letter that garnered signatures to get Proposition 226 qualified . <p> At the same time , Norquist launched parallel efforts for legislation or initiatives in at least 28 states and persuaded Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R-Miss. ) to make " Paycheck Protection " the centerpiece of any campaign finance reform bill that comes up for a vote . Neither GOP leader has been successful , but the issue remains alive in Congress and at least half a dozen states . <p> In California , which was supposed to be the pacesetter , the issue 's supporters have struggled . Rooney has quarreled with both Wilson and leaders of the California initiative over control of the message and has gone his own way . Wilson has been frustrated on other fronts . <p> While national business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce , the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business have sent mailings to their California members , the Republican National Committee rejected Wilson 's appeal for funds . " We could use a lot more help to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AFL-CIO and the California Teachers Association , alerted early , have mobilized massively to defend the flow of membership money that powers their political operations . Union chiefs insist that most members support their political agenda . Art Pulaski , head of the California Labor Federation , said Proposition 226 would " turn us into a bunch of bureaucrats , running around getting authorization forms signed every year , instead of representing and advocating for our members . " <p> Last winter , the unions paid for a signature-gathering operation big enough to qualify a counter-initiative that would have curbed business 's political contributions . Rather than file it , they took it into negotiations with the state Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups and emerged with an agreement that business would not put its muscle behind Proposition 226 . <p> Wilson calls it " intimidation " and said there have been union threats to individual businesses that violated the neutrality agreement . But a leader in the business community , speaking without attribution , said , " We told the governor that most of our members are enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unions when they can so easily retaliate . " <p> The unions hired Gale Kaufman , a veteran of the staff of Willie Brown , the former Assembly speaker who is now the San Francisco mayor , to coordinate the anti-226 campaign . She picked a newcomer to California political wars , media consultant Dawn Laguanz , to make the ads . <p> The spots told viewers that 226 was a concoction of a " foreign lobbyist " ( Norquist ) and " an out-of-state insurance tycoon " ( Rooney ) , partners of Gingrich . The ads consciously avoided the question of political checkoffs , which the unions ' polls confirmed most voters thought should be voluntary . <p> The ads described 226 as a threat to every popular program the unions had ever supported  --  Medicare , minimum-wage protection , food safety , good schools . Its real goals , the commercials said , are to " weaken patient protections against HMOs , privatize education and export American jobs . " They claimed it would cost the state and private business millions of dollars to administer and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The two young men off Wilson 's staff , Jeff Randle and Mitch Zak , assigned to pass 226 , issued statement after statement proclaiming all this " the big lie , " but it was not until two weeks ago they had the money to start airing their own ads . The first was defensive . It asked viewers to disregard all the " scare stories " and simply read the ballot language banning foreign contributions ( redundantly , since they are already outlawed ) and requiring union members ' assent to political spending . A second , now airing , takes the offensive  --  with four union members endorsing 226 and actors playing " union bosses " admitting that it could break up their money game . <p> The mismatch is even greater in the ground war . <p> Arleen Holt and Amy Chapman , who moved from AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington to run the anti-226 mobilization from San Francisco , have 56 paid area coordinators and field directors on their wall chart and , they say , " hundreds " of staff members assigned by member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation is designed to reach every union household and those who have voted regularly in past Democratic primaries five to eight times before June 2 . <p> John Hein , the CTA 's political chief , is running a parallel operation with its 220,000 members , using phone banks in 80 offices around the state . <p> Ron Nehring , hired last October to run the " Yes to 226 " operation , has a paid staff of seven and relies on volunteer help to mail materials to a list of 4,700 supporters around the state . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : May 29 , 1998 , Friday , Final Edition <p> CORRECTION : In an article Tuesday on the ballot battle in California , the name of media consultant Dawn Laguens was misspelled.
