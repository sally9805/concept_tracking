<p> At first glance , the men , women who would be governor and senator in the nation 's largest state appear to have little in common but their driving ambition . <p> One is a governor 's daughter ; another 's father was a doctor . One is the son of a legendary oil and gas wildcatter ; another 's father was an advertising executive . <p> Two are worth millions ; two count their income in the hundreds of thousands of dollars . Two are in their late 40s ; two are in their early 60s . <p> After a second look , there are striking similarities , not among the Democrats and Republicans , not among the men and women , but among the incumbents . <p> Republican Governor Pete Wilson and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein are pragmatic politicians who believe in the power of government , know how to cut deals and have spent a combined total of more than a half-century in public office . Michael Huffington , Feinstein 's challenger , would call them " career politicians . " <p> Before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , since that time  --  Feinstein and Wilson have been friends and sometimes political allies . <p> Huffington , a Republican congressman from Santa Barbara , and Kathleen Brown , the Democratic state treasurer , approach their jobs somewhat differently than their elders , the two incumbents . Huffington believes in a government that does less ; Brown believes in a government that must be equipped to handle the " new economy " brought about by a technological explosion that will bring the biggest change to the nation since the Industrial Revolution . <p> Both have received a great deal of national media attention  --  Brown 's mostly positive , Huffington 's mostly negative . Neither the positive nor the negative national attention appears to have had much of an impact on either candidacy , since each appears to be driven more by 30-second political commercials on television . <p> Huffington and Brown , too , became friends years ago after Brown and the congressman 's wife , Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington , did a brief lecture tour together . <p> In addition to that unlikely speaking tour , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include : <p> . <p> KATHLEEN BROWN <p> It was an advertisement for " Trivial Pursuit " that convinced Kathleen Brown to run for governor . <p> Brown was on an airplane , reading a magazine , when one of those annoyingly abundant advertising cards dropped out , with a " Trivial Pursuit " question about Brown 's home state : <p> " Which state could n't pay its bills and paid with IOUs ? " was the question  --  and California was the answer . <p> " I was angry , " Brown recalled . " That 's when I decided I was going to run for governor because it did n't have to be that way , and I was n't going to take it anymore . " <p> The summer of ' 92 and its 64-day stalemate over the budget , along with the state 's issuance of IOUs , became the foundation of Brown 's candidacy . <p> Never had a governor in California been so unpopular as Pete Wilson was then . Seldom had a challenger looked so good against an incumbent . <p> She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family that groomed governors the way other families prepared offspring to take over the family business . <p> Kathleen Brown  --  or Kathy , as she was then called  --  was the last child to live in the old governor 's mansion in downtown Sacramento while her father , Edmund G. ( Pat ) Brown , was governor . <p> In the last half of the 20th century , the only Democrats to serve in the California statehouse were Brown 's father and her brother , Edmund G. ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . <p> It is a formidable legacy . Brown 's standard joke about following in the footsteps of her 89-year-old father and 56-year-old brother is that running for governor in the Brown family is a " genetic defect . " She also has said that her advice for being successful in politics in this state is to " be named Brown . " <p> But Brown , 49 , had intended to wait until 1998 before making her bid for governor . By that time , she likely would have served two terms as state treasurer and solidified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her instincts  --  and the prevailing political thinking in 1992 that Governor Wilson was through  --  convinced her to try for the governor 's job in 1994 . <p> Throughout the campaign , she has been ridiculed by Wilson and his aides as too inexperienced for the governor 's chair . Her family  --  and particularly her brother  --  has been vilified throughout the campaign . <p> To spend time with Brown is to learn that she is devoted to her family , whether it is her twin grandchildren , who are 2 years old , or her parents , both in their 80s . <p> While it is in vogue for politicians to preach " family values " to the masses , Brown simply lives hers . There is rarely a day , even with a hectic campaign schedule , that Brown does not touch base with her parents , her children or her siblings and their families . <p> . <p> PETE WILSON <p> For " Peter Barton Wilson , " as Brown sometimes likes to call the governor , the 1994 gubernatorial race could help settle a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former Governor Edmund G. ( Pat ) Brown , defeated Richard M. Nixon for governor . <p> Pete Wilson was one of Nixon 's young aides during a hard-fought campaign that ended with Nixon 's infamous words to reporters : " You wo n't have Nixon to kick around anymore . " <p> In 1966 , when it was evident that Nixon 's pledge would not stick , Nixon asked his former aide to come help him put together a presidential campaign . <p> But in 1966 , Wilson intended to make his first try for public office by running for the state Assembly . <p> As Wilson said at Nixon 's funeral earlier this year , Nixon asked him if he had a good district , meaning did he have a good shot at winning . When Wilson said yes , Nixon told him he had to run for the Assembly because Wilson would never forgive himself if he did n't . <p> Wilson , 61 , has been in public office ever since . <p> As a young assemblyman , as mayor of San Diego , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaged fiscal conservatism with more moderate views on social issues . <p> He is pro-choice , a position that does not endear him to the right wing of his party . <p> But he suffered far more political harm from his decision in 1991 to cut a deal with Democrats to increase taxes . The state Republican Party would tar and feather him in effigy , and Wilson would vow never to be a party to a tax increase again . <p> Since that time , he has kept his promise on taxes and has vetoed bills on gay rights and other issues that are anathema to the religious right of his party . <p> The son of an advertising executive , Wilson is a native of Illinois who first came to San Diego during a stint in the Marines . He settled there after graduation from Boalt Hall law school in 1962 and was elected to the state Assembly from San Diego in 1966 . <p> In 1971 , he was elected mayor of San Diego and in 1982 was elected to the U.S. Senate . He was elected governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential or vice presidential prospect for the GOP if he wins re-election . <p> The first time Wilson ran for governor , in 1978 , he lost  --  badly . He finished fourth in the Republican primary . <p> . <p> MICHAEL HUFFINGTON <p> The only thing as closely guarded as Michael Huffington 's tax returns is his legislative record . <p> When a Chronicle reporter asked to speak with the Santa Barbara Congressman or his staff concerning his legislative record , the reporter was rebuffed and told , in essence , that the congressman and his staff were too busy to discuss how the office conducts the public 's business . <p> According to the public record , Huffington has almost no legislative record  --  and that is just the way he wants it . Huffington , 47 , believes that government should do less , not more , and he has put those beliefs into practice during his two years in Congress . <p> He has introduced only three bills , spoken seldom on the floor of the House of Representatives or in committee hearings . <p> His battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pundits as " The Battle of the Rich and Famous . " With a net worth of at least $ 50 million , Feinstein is among the richest members of the Senate , and with a net worth of at least $ 70 million , Huffington is the second-wealthiest member of the House of Representatives . <p> The son of a Texas oil and gas wildcatter , Huffington made his personal fortune from the sale of his father 's oil and gas business in Houston to a Taiwanese partnership . <p> The sales price of the company was kept secret by a court order sought by the Huffingtons , and privacy is a right Huffington prizes . <p> Privacy is the reason cited by Huffington for refusing to release his income tax returns , even though he is financing the great bulk of his campaign with his own money . In a recent joint appearance with Feinstein on " Larry King Live , " Huffington said he may spend as much as $ 20 million of his own money to try to become a senator . <p> During that appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion out of the public debate . Mrs. Huffington has said that she was a minister for John-Roger , who heads a Southern California movement that experts classify as a cult . <p> Although Huffington has recently begun campaigning throughout the state , for months his campaign consisted of 30-second television commercials while dodging interviews with reporters . <p> . <p> DIANNE FEINSTEIN <p> If the definition of government service is changing , no one has told Dianne Feinstein . <p> Feinstein 's two years in the Senate could not have been more different than Huffington 's two years in the House . <p> As a freshman senator , she pushed through two pieces of what would be considered landmark legislation even for a veteran : the ban on assault weapons in the crime bill and the desert protection bill . <p> She was considered to be virtually unbeatable until Huffington arrived in the race with a vast personal fortune and a willingness to spend it to get elected to the Senate . <p> As a result , Feinstein , 61 , has been catapulted into the race of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a troubled childhood and first marriage and losing her second husband to cancer , Feinstein , a doctor 's daughter , has balanced the personal side of her life 's ledger . She is married to San Francisco investment banker Richard Blum and has a close relationship with her daughter , Katherine , and her young granddaughter , Eileen . <p> It is the professional side of her life that has Feinstein worried now and has led her to confide in friends her fears about her political future . But Feinstein relishes a challenge , which has been evident this month as she has campaigned relentlessly throughout the state . <p> She has always been a hands-on manager . While serving as San Francisco 's first female mayor , Feinstein swept streets in the Tenderloin , scrubbed graffiti in Hunters Point and monitored the police and fire radio in her car . Whenever a fire hit four alarms , she scurried to the scene , donned a flak jacket and watched the firefighters work . <p> On November 27 , 1978  --  in moments that have become her own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping pull San Francisco back together after Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were gunned down in City Hall . <p> When term limits forced Feinstein from the mayor 's office in 1987 , she was considered to be a hot prospect for higher office , which she sought in 1990 . <p> After an impressive come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary for governor , Feinstein lost to Wilson in the general election by 266,000 votes . In 1992 , she ran for the remaining two years of Wilson 's Senate term , handily defeating appointed Senator John Seymour .
