<p> For most of the past decade , she 'd been dreaming , plotting , taking meetings and even , on occasion , despairing of ever getting it done right . And as Oprah Winfrey stood on the brink of realizing her dream of turning Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison 's novel " Beloved " into a movie , she did the most amazing thing of all . <p> She gave up control . <p> For about six hours . This is Oprah , after all , the second most powerful woman in American business ( according to Fortune magazine ) , one of Time magazine 's 100 most influential people and the talk show host who turned Monica Lewinsky down for her first interview and turned millions more TV watchers on to  --  gasp !  --  reading . <p> But six hours was all it took for the all-powerful Winfrey to understand what it meant to have no power at all . No voice . No control . Nothing . <p> " To connect to that part of yourself that is told you are nothing  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't act on them , " Winfrey recalled of the weekend before " Beloved " began filming , when she 'd allowed herself first to be blindfolded and then treated exactly like a slave  --  right down to pulling weeds and enduring the plantation overseer 's verbal humiliation . " I 'd never really felt anything like that before , and I do n't really want to feel it again . It was painful , dark and hollow . " <p> Yet it was also " life-transforming , " said Winfrey , during a recent interview in Atlanta . That experience strengthened her already fierce commitment to " Beloved "  --  she produced and stars in the film , which opens here Friday  --  which in turn strengthened her commitment to her " day " job . Making " Beloved " during the summer of 1997 underscored for Winfrey not just the power of having a voice  --  but of her voice in particular . <p> " I just said to my producer , ' It really is my life on purpose , ' " said Winfrey , 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively immodest theme " Change Your Life TV . " " It is exactly what I think I was born to do . " <p> It all sounds a bit much  --  so many different projects , so much self-confidence  --  but this is Oprah , after all . <p> " She and Madonna and the pope are probably the three most recognized people in the world , and she 's so down-to-earth and so sincere , " said Anthony Cohen , the young historian who pulled together actors , period-appropriate outfits and props , and even a few bloodhounds so Winfrey could experience firsthand her character 's life as a slave . ( Less period-appropriate , perhaps , Cohen reassured " Beloved 's " slightly nervous producers that a 20-man SWAT team would protect Winfrey in " uncontrolled " situations such as running through woods . ) " I just do n't see how she does it all . I do n't know how she holds it all together , but she constantly outdoes herself . " <p> Outdoes herself ? What she did in " Beloved , " Winfrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onetime slave living with her teenage daughter , Denver ( Kimberly Elise ) , in rural Ohio in 1873 , Winfrey struggles to tamp down all reminders of her painful past . The unexpected appearance of Paul D. ( Danny Glover ) , an old friend from her slave days , brings male companionship for Sethe  --  and resentment from Denver , who jealously guards her relationship with her mother . But it is the arrival of the mysterious young girl Beloved ( Thandie Newton ) that truly threatens the delicate balance in a household so full of secrets . <p> Winfrey is virtually unrecognizable as Sethe , although that has little to do with the current Vogue cover girl 's period clothing and uncoiffed hair onscreen . <p> No , it 's more the way this Oprah is n't " Oprah ! , " the ebulliently self-unediting , larger-than-life personality we almost ca n't help but know through her 12 years ( and still counting ) on TV , her best-selling books and videotapes and her innumerable magazine interviews . <p> Instead , Winfrey seemingly disappears into Sethe , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost reluctantly , revealed as she struggles not to revisit that painful , dark and hollow place in her head . <p> This from the woman who once publicly gloated about her dieting success by wheeling 67 pounds of animal fat onstage ? Who 's made her own personal life  --  from the rape and abuse she suffered as a child , to her cocaine use as a young adult and even her longtime relationship with " is he or is n't he still her fiance ? " Stedman Graham  --  a virtual open book ? Who made sure everyone knew she 'd decided not to be the first to interview Lewinsky  --  and why  --  by discussing it both on her show and with TV Guide for a cover story ? " It was the greatest challenge for me not to be emotional , " admitted Winfrey , who heavily credits director Jonathan Demme with helping her figure out the best way to play Sethe . " He said , ' She 's already lived through it , so the telling of the story would be nothing compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , she never would have allowed herself to feel that deeply . ' <p> " He did that constantly , " Winfrey continued , leaning forward and clapping her hands loudly twice . " Every day , ' Pull it back ! Let 's pull it back ! ' " <p> But fear not , that other Oprah never really went away . How could she have , when she was the guiding spirit behind a movie that seemingly no one else  --  not even the author of the book on which it would be reverently , almost literally , based  --  wanted to see on the big screen ? <p> " When I read the book , I felt that I needed to talk to somebody , and the only person I could think of was Toni Morrison , " said Winfrey , glancing around a cavernous suite at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead as if trying to see herself in 1987 when her syndicated show was but a year old and she was less schooled in the ways of Hollywood . " I said , ' I want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winfrey went on in a self-mockingly chirpy tone . " ' You can write the screenplay if you want to ! ' " <p> Morrison wanted no part of that , but she gave Winfrey permission to knock herself out trying to adapt her book . <p> " I was very naive because I had no idea how difficult it would be to get this done , " said Winfrey , looking a bit weary the morning after she 'd attended a post- " Beloved " screening reception with members of Atlanta 's Hillside Chapel and Truth Center church . " I did n't realize how difficult it was going to be to get a screenplay written . I did n't realize that Hollywood would n't immediately say , ' Sure ! Let 's tell this story ! ' I did n't realize how difficult it would be to get a director who would agree with my vision of what the film could be . And that 's why it took 10 years . " <p> Nor did every potential director agree she at least deserved a shot at playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding the right actress for the role if she turned out to be wrong . <p> " It was essential to me that I be allowed to try , that I not be immediately , sort of , discarded , " said Winfrey , who 'd received an Oscar nomination for 1985 's " The Color Purple , " then her only previous feature film . " Because many directors just immediately said to me , ' Well , how are you going to do that ? How are you going to produce and act ? ' I think they thought it was going to be some sort of big ego diva thing going on . " <p> Nothing could be further from the truth , according to Kimberly Elise , her " Beloved " co-star . <p> " I probably saw her like everybody else : this truly amazing powerhouse , you know , an intelligent , revolutionary woman , " Elise said . " And then when I got to know her . . . it was like long-lost family . She 's passionate and she 's very sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just rare . " <p> She might have left an indelible mark on her co-stars . Still , Winfrey said , the movie was never really about her . <p> " I called the spirit of the ancestors , literally , into myself , " said Winfrey , who read slave narratives and historical accounts throughout filming and filled her trailer with some of the authentic slave documents she has purchased from antiques dealers , including one in Atlanta . " I would light a candle and say their names before every scene . ' I 'm doing this one for Little John  --  ( who was sold for ) $ 350 . For Isabella  --  $ 400 . ' I never read a newspaper in three months . I just surrounded myself with only material from the period , to keep myself there . To keep myself there . " <p> Those days , suffice it to say , are over . Oprah  --  make that " Oprah ! "  --  ca n't turn around right now without seeing herself splashed all over the media . Nor , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cities talking up " Beloved . " In Atlanta , a screening originally open to local media suddenly became exclusive to Time magazine and its four-article package  --  including a cover hailing " The Beloved Oprah "  --  in its Sept. 28 issue . <p> That same issue of " Time " features an " exclusive " excerpt from Winfrey 's journal , " Journey to Beloved , " which will be published in book form by Hyperion on Friday . That 's the same day that " Beloved " opens in theaters and when the subject of " The Oprah Winfrey Show " will be  --  what else ?  --  the cast and the story of making " Beloved . " <p> If the synergy is breathtaking , so is the level of control . Winfrey can be interviewed for this article but not photographed . The article should n't run on wire services , where other news outlets might pick it up . Cohen eventually agrees to speak with a reporter about the re-enactment but first he speaks with Winfrey . <p> Maybe it 's standard procedure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been accessible to the media and has written book reviews and opinion columns for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and been quoted frequently in articles on everything from the importance of keeping a journal to the look of the Georgia Dome . <p> Now Cleage 's debut novel , " What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day " is the next reading selection of " Oprah 's Book Club "  --  something that has meant instant best-seller status and unparalleled career boosts for Wally Lamb , Jacquelyn Mitchard and others . Now when Cleage answers her phone , she points reporters requesting an interview toward Harpo Productions , Winfrey 's production company , where publicists want to know when the article will run , whether it will include photographs and the like . <p> A cynic might see " Beloved " as the next , logical step in Winfrey 's assault of all media : Having conquered TV and books , the thinking goes , movies are the next logical step . Or maybe , with Jerry Springer breathing down her Nielsen neck ( his trash talk show actually has higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bets by building an acting career . <p> A cynic gets nowhere with Winfrey . For one thing , she said , " Beloved " could result in her doing less acting . <p> " I thought that this would make me get the acting bug , " said Winfrey , admitting her surprise . " But it was so different than acting that I came away thinking that I really only want to do what 's meaningful to me . I really do n't want to just act . " <p> For another , " Beloved " seems less a career move than a state of mind where Winfrey is concerned . Just as the movie ends on a slightly more optimistic note than the book , Winfrey seems more at peace than ever  --  with herself , with her decision to continue hosting her talk show at least through the 2001-02 season and with her increasing focus on positive , life-enhancing and spiritually nourishing topics . <p> Even , unbelievable as it seems , with Springer . <p> " Actually I was encouraged by Jerry Springer , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I saw how absolutely bipolar we were and that he is sort of going all the way out there , you know , with people picking up chairs . . . . The degree of his vulgarity encouraged me to move in the opposite direction in the same kind of force and power . " <p> And as Cohen pointed out , Winfrey does n't just move herself . She moves countless others , as well , many of whom may discover inner strength or talents they never knew they had . <p> " I think she 's at a place in her evolution that a lot of the world would like to be , " said Cohen , 34 , who appeared on Winfrey 's show in 1996 to discuss his two-month , 1,200-mile retracing by foot of the Underground Railroad . " She has so many things she can give just by being herself , and it 's things people need . I think we all want to be better , to experience life to the fullest , and I think we can vicariously do it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by managing to pull together ( with the help of the Maryland National Park and Planning Commission ) the entire re-enactment experience within just eight days of being contacted by Harpo Productions . Told Winfrey wanted him to take her out on the Underground Railroad , Cohen said , he created a scenario in which she was a once-free black woman , captured and sold into slavery . Placed on a plantation ( actually , an old Quaker community in Montgomery County , Md . ) , Winfrey was surrounded by actors playing everyone from slaves to the overseer  --  and left to figure things out for herself . <p> " You 'll meet a number of people  --  some black , some white , some friends and some enemies , " Winfrey was told by Cohen , who 's filming a documentary about a second trek he 's making and whose book , " The Underground Railroad : A Personal Journey " is due in February . " You wo n't know who is who and you 'll have to decide who to trust in order to survive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , saw another slave being sold off the plantation , dealt with the cruel overseer and  --  finally  --  escaped along with several others . Following a poor white woman whose name they never learned , they forded creeks , fields and swampy areas before finally reaching the first safe house . After hiding while the local " sheriff " searched the premises , Winfrey was dressed in Quaker clothes to continue on the next step of a journey Cohen had planned to last 48 hours . <p> " Oprah essentially collapsed , " recalled Cohen , who was surprised at how mentally drained he was by that point as well . " Not physically , but she was emotionally wrecked . She basically said , ' I want to go on , but I do n't know if I can . This is too real . This has brought up too much for me . ' " <p> Knowing Winfrey had to start filming in two days , Cohen ended the re-enactment before ever getting to some of the more dramatic developments  --  including smuggling her in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in a barn that would be circled by bloodhounds  --  with no regrets . <p> " Oprah is probably the one person in the world who , if she does a role like this , can get across to people exactly what that experience would have been like , " said Cohen , who later received what he 'll describe only as a " generous " check from Winfrey , that he used to buy a 40-volume series of slave narratives for a library he 's planning as part of his nonprofit North Star Foundation to restore Underground Railroad safe houses . " We were like , ' Wow , the chance to work with Oprah , the chance to help her help people learn what that would have been like , is phenomenal . ' <p> " Our goal was just to wear her out , " Cohen concluded with a chuckle . " I guess it only took six hours instead of 48 . " <p> Well , this is Oprah , after all . The arrival of Beloved ( Thandie Newton , right ) , a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Oprah Winfrey , center ) and her daughter , Denver ( Kimberly Elise ) . The film , which opens Friday , is based on the novel by Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison . / KEN REGAN / Touchstone Pictures Photo : " I thought that this would make me get the acting bug .
