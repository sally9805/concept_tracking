" I was 21 , 22 years old the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fishburne said . " I was working on a film called The Cotton Club in New York City . And Gregory Hines Sr. , Gregory 's father , would often sit around and give all of us history lessons and one of the things that he would tell about was the Tuskegee Airmen . So that was the first time . And , of course , I saw them as a source of inspiration and they were a source of great pride for me . " Robert Williams , a Tuskegee airman himself who served as co-executive producer of the film , told reporters : " We graduated 992 pilots of Tuskegee Army Airbase during that period of time . Four hundred and forty-five of us went overseas and flew combat . We lost 66 . Of all the missions the men flew bomber escort , they never lost a bomber . Chief Alfred Anderson , one of our instructors , met Mrs. Roosevelt when she came down to visit our training base . She told him that in Washington , the generals say that Blacks do n't have sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men look like they do quite well . And he said , ' Yes ma'am , they do very well . ' She then asked Chief Anderson to take her up in a plane . The Secret Service escort did n't want her to fly with the chief . He called the President and told him the first lady was about to go up in one of these training planes with an African American . Roosevelt told him , ' Sir , if Eleanor says she 's going up , she 's going up . ' " He pointed out that when the Black pilots returned home they " were n't welcomed " at any bases but Tuskegee . Paris Qualles , who wrote the script , said the project was a dream come true . " With my father being a Tuskegee airman , I had heard about the exploits of this group ever since I was old enough to comprehend . And this was back in the ' 50s . And I was constantly looking and wondering as I watched television , when will I see this ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly fell in my lap not too long ago , I was delighted . I mean , it was a karmic happening . " <p>
