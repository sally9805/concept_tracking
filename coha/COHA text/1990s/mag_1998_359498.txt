" IT 'S NOBODY 'S BUSINESS BUT OURS . " <P> After seven months of lies , deception , frivolous legal maneuvering and constant attacks on independent counsel Kenneth Starr , Bill Clinton thinks all he has to do is bite his lower lip , confess and tell Americans it 's time to move on SPECIAL REPORT , Aug. 31 . We simply can not abide by a standard that says it is O.K. for a President to engage in an extramarital affair inside the White House with a 21-year-old intern , lie under oath and then engage in sidetracking the inquiry seeking to uncover his wrongdoing . We can not , as a nation , afford to remain indifferent and silent regarding this man 's conduct . DOUGLAS G. VETTER New York City <P> I hope the leaders of our country , including the Supreme Court Justices , will consider the wisdom of allowing a sitting President to defend a civil suit while in office . The disruption , destruction and divisiveness our nation has experienced over the past months have been exhausting to the people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Clinton admitted his mistake ( to a certain degree ) , then spent the rest of his Aug. 17 speech attacking Ken Starr . But Clinton brought this on himself . Could n't he just say , " I 'm sorry . It was all my fault . I misled the American people and my family , and I am the only one to blame " ? No . He basically blamed Starr . Enough is enough . It 's time for a change . JUSTIN DUDLEY , 15 Iowa Park , Texas <P> Oh , my God ! the President of the U.S. is ... human ! PATRICIA BECKER-SPELLMAN Stevenson Ranch , Calif . <P> As an assistant principal who has dealt with adolescent behavior for nearly three decades , I have found that it is not very difficult to distinguish between those who are truly sorry for their misbehavior and those who are only sorry they got caught . Most other Americans can tell the difference too . JOHN CAPANNA Pasadena , Calif . The simple words of the Rev. Jim Casy in John Steinbeck 's The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There ai n't no sin and there ai n't no virtue . There 's just stuff people do . It 's all part of the same thing . And some of the things folks do is nice , and some ai n't nice , but that 's as far as any man got a right to say . " DONALD A. HERRON Sugar Land , Texas <P> " An inappropriate relationship " is what Clinton called it ; a shameful disgrace to the office of President of the U.S. is what it is . THOMAS L. BRINSON New Bern , N.C. <P> I , like President Clinton , will do anything to avoid the prying eyes of self-righteous demons like Starr and his horde , who show such utter contempt for privacy . JOHN BROUWER Alliston , Ont . <P> Clinton and his lies have cost American taxpayers millions of dollars . It is not Starr who is responsible but the President through his sex-crazed actions . How can people defend this immoral man ? Where has our morality gone ? Following the President 's , I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended this long ago by not answering questions that no one had any business asking . If others are so quick to condemn Clinton for not being a saint , they should rightfully welcome intense public investigations into their own sex lives . If only perfect Americans who have never lied should be elected , then 99% of the politicians in office should resign at once . CAROLINE KIM Cleveland , Texas
