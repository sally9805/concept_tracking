<p> Rookie jitters . Rookie mistakes . Rookie inexperience . With so many warning labels , you wonder why National Football League teams ever let these kids off the bench . <p> Here 's why : <p> - Jitters ? Rookie Emmitt Smith showed only jitterbug moves as he ran for 132 yards and two scores in Dallas ' Thanksgiving Day victory against Washington . <p> - Mistakes ? Rookie quarterback Jeff George has made them , but he threw for three touchdowns Sunday as Indianapolis upset Cincinnati . <p> - Inexperience ? Rookies Richmond Webb and Keith Sims are relative babes , but they 're 300-pound babes and starting on the left side of Miami 's offensive line . <p> " I still make rookie mistakes . I guess the rest of the year I 'll probably feel like a rookie , because every now and then you get a rookie joke from one the veterans , " says Webb . <p> " But it 's not bad being a rookie . I sort of enjoy it . We 're winning . ... I 'm having fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow starters , perhaps more than you 'd expect in a class pumped up by draft-eligible juniors . <p> But others have made their marks on team turnarounds and division races . One position where rookies are throwing their weight around is the offensive line . <p> " In the last few years , there have been more rookie offensive linemen come in and start than there have been in a long while , " says John Sandusky , Miami offensive line coach . <p> " One big reason is there is so much passing going on in college football . ... Before you used to get these kids out of a wishbone and a veer ( offense ) and it took you two training camps to get them ready to pass block . " <p> In Miami , left tackle Webb , a first-rounder from Texas A &M,; and left guard Sims , a second-rounder from Iowa State , started every preseason game while veterans Roy Foster and Jeff Dellenbach held out . " In preseason , we played Minnesota , Chicago , Philadelphia and Denver , " says Sims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Doleman , Keith Millard , Dan Hampton and ' The Fridge . ' The baptism really helped us out . " <p> The veterans returned , but the rookies stayed in the lineup . <p> Miami quarterback Dan Marino on Sims and Webb : " The big thing they do is come off the ball and move people . ... They 're young , they believe we can run the ball and they believe in each other . " <p> In San Diego , rookie center Frank Cornish ( sixth round , UCLA ) has been a starter all season ; rookie Leo Goeas ( third round , Hawaii ) has gained a starting job at left tackle . <p> Kansas City was starting rookie center Tim Grunhard ( second round , Notre Dame ) until his recent thumb injury ; left guard David Szott ( seventh round , Penn State ) has started the last six games . <p> " It 's different in the NFL , because every week you go against the absolute best , " says Szott . " ... There are times when I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I 'm improving every game , too . " <p> Consistency has been the trademark of Chicago rookie safety Mark Carrier , the sixth player chosen in the draft . Some questioned whether the Southern Cal junior should have gone that high . <p> But he has started every game , with five interceptions and a team-high five forced fumbles . <p> " Obviously , I want to make a contribution , " says Carrier . " I 'm a little surprised at the number of turnovers I 've been able to force . I like to think I 've made somewhat of an impact . " <p> Coach Mike Ditka on Carrier : " He 's very studious . ... He wants to play . ... Whether he has every physical skill , I do n't know . He gets the ball . ... And he 's having a little fun , and I like to see people having fun . " <p> The NFL has n't been so much fun for some other early picks : <p> - Cortez Kennedy ( No. 3 ) is a backup defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - Tampa Bay backup outside linebacker Keith McCants ( No. 4 ) has one sack . <p> - Quarterback Andre Ware ( No. 7 overall and last season 's Heisman Trophy winner ) has one touchdown pass with Detroit . A holdout most of camp , he got his only start Nov. 11 against Minnesota but was benched after two first-half interceptions . <p> - The special-teams tackle Houston linebacker Lamar Lathon made Monday night against Buffalo was his second tackle of the season . The No. 15 pick billed himself as " Sudden Impact " on arrival , but he 's a third-stringer after arthroscopic shoulder surgery earlier this season . <p> However , there are success stories , too , or at least the early chapters : <p> - George , the draft 's No. 1 choice as a junior eligible , sustained a concussion in his opening-game start for Indianapolis on a hit by Buffalo 's Cornelius Bennett . He also had an abdominal strain and bruised knee . <p> But in his last two games , he has completed 35 of 53 passes for 500 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George is going to be a top-flight quarterback , " says Cincinnati coach Sam Wyche . " You have to compliment Indianapolis for making that trade . " <p> The deal with Atlanta gave Indianapolis the pick . The Colts gave up wide receiver Andre Rison , tackle Chris Hinton and their No. 1 in ' 91 . <p> Thirty-four rookie quarterbacks have started in the NFL since the merger . Only seven have thrown more touchdown passes than interceptions their first season . George so far : eight touchdown passes , seven interceptions . <p> " I 'm just doing what they ask of me , " he says . " I realize there will be ups and downs . ... My confidence level has always been there . " <p> - In Dallas , Emmitt Smith ( another junior and the 17th pick overall ) did n't sign until the week before the regular season . But he has run for 654 yards and six touchdowns and added 20 catches for 182 yards . <p> Washington defensive end Charles Mann on Smith 's Thanksgiving showing : " Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Emmitt Smith is a great back . He made us miss . ... You ca n't arm-tackle him . " <p> Smith does n't have exceptional speed . But he showed his moves and savvy when Redskins cornerback Darrell Green almost ran him down on a game- clinching 48-yard touchdown . Smith slowed , gave Green a move and a stiff-arm and went in for the score . <p> - Rookie tight end Eric Green of the Pittsburgh Steelers ( the draft 's 21st pick ) has a team record for a tight end - six touchdown receptions . The 6-5 , 275-pounder signed late , missing the first three games . <p> - The surprise of the draft might be Phoenix running back Johnny Johnson , a seventh-rounder from San Jose State , where he was dismissed from the team his senior year . He has rushed for 801 yards , tops among rookies and sixth overall , despite missing last weekend 's game with an ankle injury . <p> " Johnny 's the most prolific seventh-round draft choice I 've ever been around , " says Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on this team as Earl Campbell had on Houston as a rookie . " <p> - Philadelphia 's two starting rookie receivers , Calvin Williams and Fred Barnett , have 11 touchdown receptions . <p> - San Diego 's Junior Seau ( No. 5 overall ) and Kansas City 's Percy Snow ( No. 13 ) have been starters at inside linebacker . Both struggled early , but both are coming on . Seau has 50 solo tackles and Snow 41 . <p> " They told me they were drafting me to help with the running defense , and I think I 'm up to the task , " says Snow . " ... I know I 've made some rookie mistakes . But I do n't think I 've done anything to hurt the team . " <p> For any rookie , the test is n't to avoid making any mistakes ; it 's to forget them and move on . <p> Cornerback Vince Buck , a second-round pick from Central State ( Ohio ) , is the New Orleans Saints ' nickel back in passing situations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdown pass that gave the Falcons a fourth-quarter lead . But Buck 's later diving tackle of Deion Sanders at his 20-yard line on a kickoff return helped New Orleans secure a victory . " Being that I had been beaten for the long ball , I felt like I had to come back and make a big play , " says Buck . <p> That 's the credo for other rookie defensive backs starting , like Tony Stargell of the New York Jets , Ben Smith of Philadelphia and Alton Montgomery of Denver . <p> In the second half of a loss to Pittsburgh , Montgomery was victimized often by veteran Louis Lipps . <p> " I took it pretty hard . I shed a few tears , " says Montgomery . <p> But that 's behind him . <p> " It 's coming to me each and every day , " he says . " Things get a little better . ... Just give me some time . " <p> Miami 's Sims provides the bottom line for rookies : ' It 's not easy at all . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have confidence in us . " CUTLINE : NEW KIDS ON BLOCKS : Keith Sims , left , and Richmond Webb start in Miami offensive line . CUTLINE : DYNAMIC DUO : Phoenix 's Johnny Johnson , left , and Dallas ' Emmitt Smith are running well .
