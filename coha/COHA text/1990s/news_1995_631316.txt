Bobby Jindal , Louisiana Governor No star shone as brightly after Obama 's election as Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal 's . He is a youthful , vibrant conservative whose Indian heritage displayed in living color the GOP 's diversity . Then he stood in front of a teleprompter to answer Obama 's State of the Union address , and it all blew up . But he 's coming back and fighting Obama on major issues as he toys with a 2012 presidential run . One example : He 's among a few governors refusing to accept federal stimulus money , and he has pledged to veto any legislation involving it . " He 's a solid conservative and an ideas and solutions factory , " says a friend . Mitt Romney , Former Massachusetts Governor OK . So the great GOP economic candidate of the 2008 presidential primaries could n't beat Sen. John McCain , who declared the economy was sound . But all that happened before the bottom dropped out of the economy , and now the former Massachusetts governor and son of Michigan has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . He helped lead the war on the " card check " legislation easing union organizing . And Romney 's credentials go beyond money : He is also a voice for antiabortion activists , saying Obama 's policies are a kiss to the " most extreme wing of the abortion lobby , " and he has a depth of experience in the financial world matched by few others . Newt Gingrich , Republican Thinker The former House speaker has been out of power for 10 years , but he is the dominant Republican thinker and voice whose advice is sought by House and Senate conservatives and who some sneer has never had an unspoken -- or un-Twittered -- thought . Gingrich does n't just say no to the president . He normally has a counterproposal and has worked on many issues , like healthcare , longer than President Obama has . His network is vast , led by his American Solutions and Contract With America allies who could be the basis of a 2012 presidential bid . Rush Limbaugh , Radio Host " I hope he fails . " Using those four words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limbaugh mobilized the right and his 20 million listeners . And with every White House retort , his audience grew larger . He 's not attractive just to conservatives : Independents are also listening . " He talks to indies and Dems as well , " says conservative activist Greg Mueller . And Limbaugh has a record of beating power : Team Clinton tried to quiet him in the 1990s , but his radio pronouncements helped the GOP win its first congressional majority in 40 years . Sarah Palin , Alaska Governor There are a zillion reasons to write off the Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee as not ready for prime time : her GOP convention shopping spree , her daughter 's teen motherhood and subsequent feud with the teen father . But do n't fall for the conventional wisdom . She has a large and dedicated network of conservative and female activists . Most say the McCain campaign abused her by keeping her from the media , then not defending her when her comments were distorted . She can take control of the energy debate and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push her state 's natural gas . Allies say it 's just a matter of time before this lifelong hunter draws a bead on Obama and his policies .
