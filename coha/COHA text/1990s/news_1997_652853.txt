<p> IF ARCHITECTS HAVE VISIONS AND MUSICIANS have needs , why did so much go wrong in the building of Lincoln Center ? Momentous decisions of design and financing attend the birth of any arts center , but they are eventually reducible to one : the needs of the arts versus the art of the possible . I suggest that the first has been sacrificed in the name of the second . <p> In so many ways , Lincoln Center , now immersed in the second season of its namesake summer festival , has been an enormous success over its 35 years of life . The location is central ; the address is prestigious ; the publicity flows endlessly . The surrounding neighborhood has flowered . The four main theaters have elbowed their way to the center of New York 's , and thus the country 's , musical life . Carnegie Hall may have the patina of tradition , but Lincoln Center has the television cameras . <p> Are Lincoln Center 's tenants happy ? Are their customers ? Are the needs of both parties met ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Rarely . In one way or another , the buildings have let their inhabitants down , but with little hope of significant change , we have gotten used to them . I wonder how many of us , in our heart of hearts , really like Lincoln Center , yet we go there anyway . It is where things happen . <p> The New York State Theater , the Metropolitan Opera House , Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall ( reading the map of Lincoln Center 's musical buildings from south to north ) emerged between 1962 and 1969 . The real-life neighborhoods of " West Side Story " were swept aside to make room for them , and more than five million patrons drop in every year , buying tickets to operas , plays , dance programs , concerts and recitals . <p> The city owns the land ; a nonprofit corporation , the buildings . Crassly put , Lincoln Center is New York 's shopping mall for the performing arts . If you ca n't get into " Carmen " at the Met , Bruckner at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Arnold Toynbee told us that civilizations thrive more readily in harsh climates than in ecological paradises . For the making of music , Lincoln Center has certainly challenged rather than welcomed . Artists struggle daily with bad decisions made years ago , and these struggles , waged against conditions now inscribed in stone , may actually represent the most gripping theater Lincoln Center has to offer . <p> Lincoln Center has 11 constituents  --  dance , film , theater , libraries , schools  --  but music is the topic here , so first of all , how do these theaters let us hear ? Not terribly well , in most cases . Acousticians wax long-winded about the science of sound , but the brief history of Lincoln Center demonstrates the crapshoot that is acoustics . Why else have the State Theater and Fisher Hall ( originally Philharmonic Hall ) been continually tinkered with and on several major occasions completely overhauled ? Repairmen dominate the acoustical trade today . Indeed , rejiggering the mistakes of colleagues is big business for firms , any one of which might consider Hindsight Inc. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about is fit . Are the various artists of Lincoln Center operating in the right places ? Wynton Marsalis seems happy to be heading up Lincoln Center 's jazz division , but he still has n't found a hall in it where jazz really belongs . ( A contemplated theatrical space across Broadway on 64th Street may be helpful . ) New York State Theater For Emerging Voices , A Dilemma in a Paradox <p> The State Theater gets in opera 's way . A good place for dance , say those who know , it does not serve the New York City Opera well . Backstage areas are small for operatic purposes , the wings even more claustrophobic . While operating areas are cramped , the State Theater 's towering audience space is the opposite , reducing any hope of intimacy . Putting on Broadway musicals as part of its season is one of the City Opera 's brighter ideas in recent years , but these entertainments are lost in the State Theater . The need for significant amplification makes the productions seem artificial ; the distances make them cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was : that is , after several significant makeovers in the last 15 years . Its stage floor was designed to muffle the sound of dancing feet . Over the years , that floor has done much the same for singing voices . The City Opera is caught in paradox : being an important way station for emerging American voices yet presenting an environment that can strain young techniques . <p> The devisers of Lincoln Center and of the City Opera never wanted each other in the first place . The New York City Ballet was desirable  --  indeed , necessary  --  to the center , but the City Opera 's cut-rate fare would undermine competing activities of other constituents , all offered at higher prices . The City Opera feared the inevitable comparisons with its huge , international next-door neighbor and was right to do so . But it also knew that if it stayed at the City Center , the Met would create its own budget opera at the State Theater and squeeze the City Opera out of business . Accepting the City Opera made Lincoln Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did . <p> Moving this brave if helter-skelter company to a smaller , more opera-friendly house  --  perhaps a Broadway theater  --  has been talked about for years . Money is a problem . With little or no endowment of its own , the City Opera badly needs its yearly slice of the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for Lincoln Center , which in recent years has averaged $3.4 million . Independence , a heady thought , makes board members understandably queasy , for the Wallace money would not go with them . Met Opera House Wanted : Singers Built Like Defensive Tackles <p> A few yards to the northwest is the Metropolitan Opera House . Seating 3,800 patrons , the Met is the King Kong of opera houses . The new Opera de la Bastille in Paris , at 2,700 seats , is already vastly larger than the old Palais Garnier ( 1,900 seats ) ; it seems small beside its New York colleague . Typical European houses  --  in comparison . Many of the bel canto pieces regularly produced at the Met were conceived for Italian houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teatro del Giglio in Lucca , where a stage whisper is perfectly audible in the balcony 's last row . The Met is twice too big for its own good , and that is not hyperbole . <p> Forget , for yet another while , a Mini-Met in that proposed new theater across the street . People inside the Met point to the high union and production costs for first-rate productions in a small house and shake their heads . <p> Given its intractable problems , size being one , the Met shows admirable resolve and intelligence . Acoustics that are relatively good , considering the gargantuan dimensions , help a lot . The Met has also developed the most sophisticated and smoothly operating backstage in the world . Foreign directors , who do n't necessarily like the space , come here because things work . Under James Levine , the Met has built a pit orchestra of uncontested superiority . <p> But the Met ca n't make its stage any smaller ; nor can it propagate intimacy in a setting that screams of bigness . It tries , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage ( " Cosi Fan Tutte " ) , focusing the eye on central points ( " Queen of Spades " ) , repeatedly framing smaller stages within the given one . Exploiting the Met 's grandiosity can backfire , as it did this year in the distant , scattered setting for " Eugene Onegin . " Franco Zeffirelli 's bloated Puccini extravaganzas are huge audience successes , even if Puccini is lost among the towering columns and gold-leaf decor . <p> The Met 's major artistic challenge is finding voices that can be heard in it . Some were always there , but a new generation of consistent heft and brilliance is beginning to arrive . Think of football : the 200-pound lineman of 30 years ago looks puny on the field today ; a changing athletic world has bred athletes nearly twice his size . It may not be an exaggeration to suggest that the Met is nudging us toward a whole new operatic culture . Singing teachers , impresarios and agents around the world now scout big voices and discourage smaller ones . The Met is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows it . <p> With gain there is loss . Finer , smaller voices are lost to Met audiences . The heldentenor Siegfried Jerusalem , by all accounts a splendid Tristan at Bayreuth and Vienna , could not do it here . Newly arrived , on the other hand , is Ben Heppner , with a big tenor sound of quality , seemingly engineered with the Met in mind . Jane Eaglen will thrive in this house . Voices with presence , Deborah Voigt 's or Karita Mattila 's , will also succeed . <p> As these singers enter , another culture , nearly extinct already , exits . I remember seven years ago , at the Opera Theater of St. Louis , a young tenor named Stanford Olsen singing Donizetti exquisitely before a sold-out audience of 950 at the Loretto-Hilton Theater . Mr. Olsen 's subsequent career at the Met has been less happy . Four times bigger , the New York house has not only smothered his singing but may have damaged his voice as well . <p> The Metropolitan Opera House 's bigness signals American exuberance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world by subsidized opera houses , the Met has gone it virtually alone and done remarkably well . Seats must be sold , lots of them , every night . Avery Fisher Hall By Any Name , A Chronic Head Case <p> The building just to the northeast of the Met is Lincoln Center 's resident manic-depressive . Limping from disappointment to disappointment since it opened as Philharmonic Hall in 1962 , the home of the New York Philharmonic finally had to be closed , excavated and rebuilt as Avery Fisher Hall in the mid-70 's . Dull and dead-sounding in early life , it became garish and top-heavy . <p> Helping not at all was the Philharmonic 's choice as music director for the 1980 's . Zubin Mehta 's relish of loudness and brilliance , often expressed in superficial terms , compounded the felony of Fisher 's new acoustics while playing on the worst instincts of a virtuoso urban orchestra . Yet another revision five years ago , featuring new ceiling panels and tumorlike protrusions along both sides of the stage , has done much to bring Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the recent changes recognize that listeners hear with their eyes as well as their ears . Fisher gives off a glare , a brightness , an unpleasant impression of heat . Listeners and musicians feel its effects . The new appurtenances , helpful as they are , add more hideousness to what was already an antimusical atmosphere . Great performances overcome adversity , and they happen at Fisher Hall . The most recent to my knowledge was in the spring : the Verdi Requiem conducted by Sir Colin Davis , a remarkable evening . Alice Tully Hall To Be or Not To Be A Chamber Hall <p> Across the street to the north is Alice Tully Hall . Hamlet-like , it never made up its mind . Lurking in Tully 's design is an element of greed , a desire to have it both ways . For here a theater that claims to be a home for chamber music ends up seating almost 1,100 patrons , not the 400 or 600 one would await . The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is the titular resident here , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to mention duos , trios and quintets , too remote for comfort . Hearing a solo pianist from Tully 's balcony , unless the artist has a truly extraordinary presence , is really no different from listening at the back of the much larger Carnegie and Fisher Halls . <p> Full orchestras can crowd themselves on stage at Tully , and the acoustical space handles them acceptably . But in the end , the hall is too big for the small and too small for the big . Its wood panels are not ugly . The seats are nicely spaced for leg room . Doors close silently . Gone , unfortunately , are the lobby 's marvelous purple carpets , now replaced by play-it-safe green . <p> Some things work in Tully Hall : smaller orchestras like the New York Chamber Symphony , pianists like Garrick Ohlsson . Concert performances of smaller-scale operas come across well . The Lincoln Center vocal series , an excellent enterprise , features Met-size voices in recital , and they have been a good fit . But Lincoln Center has no truly appropriate chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , but the dullness of the sound reflects its purpose as a place for movies , not music . Juilliard Theater The Little Auditorium That Could <p> Is there a Lincoln Center hall that works as it should ? One , but constituents will never get their hands on it . Buried in the bowels of the Juilliard School behind Tully Hall is the Juilliard Theater . It is a treasure , an oasis . The size , capacity 900 , is sane for most of the opera repertory . The amphitheater design offers good sound and sight lines . It , like Carnegie Hall , is a place listeners feel good to be in . <p> Juilliard has fended off outsiders and kept it for school purposes , which are many . There is another problem : The Juilliard Theater does not employ union stagehands , and the other crews at Lincoln Center would not respond kindly to its use by the center at large . <p> WHAT TO DO ? NOTHING , really . The buildings wo n't go away . They do big business . The tinkering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are lessons for the future , perhaps , one being not to entrust artistic decisions to committees consisting primarily of lawyers and politicians . It also might be a good idea to find architects with a bolder , more selfish vision , people less ready to mollify the moneymen and city planners . <p> Somehow , America 's best qualities , the ones that fuel our social , economic and political engines , never work with art . Killing the National Endowment for the Arts , for example , makes perfect sense to a lot of good people raised on American ideas of self-reliance and private enterprise . The isolated , inexperienced capitalist mind finds it hard indeed to fathom the ways art lives and works , so it is little wonder that lawmakers and businessmen remain bewildered if not hostile . <p> Artistic vision requires a certain totalitarianism . Consensus succeeds in much of America , but consensus in the arts produces Lincoln Centers . The Europeans have a lot of bad ideas about how to run a country , but they have a knack for finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . An example is the architect Frank Gehry , who has more or less had his way in the building of a new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain . A similar design , the Disney Concert Hall in Mr. Gehry 's hometown , Los Angeles , remains a mighty struggle , pushed and pulled by politicians and money-raisers . <p> I doubt that many of us would trade our passports for Spanish ones , but at moments one feels a certain wistfulness . Then again , maybe Toynbee was right . Maybe all the things wrong with Lincoln Center are meant to test us , provoke us to listen harder , play better and sing like angels . Roll up your sleeves .
