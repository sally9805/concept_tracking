<p> A capsule look at the major players each major league team has signed , re-signed , lost , traded or acquired since the end of the season and their needs heading into this week 's winter meetings : <p> AL EAST <p> NEW YORK YANKEES <p> ( 114-48 , World Series champions ) <p> Kept Him : CF Bernie Williams , RHP David Cone , 3B Scott Brosius , C Joe Girardi . <p> Got Him : RHP Dan Naulty . <p> Lost Him : OF Tim Raines . <p> Wish List : Without making a major acquisition , the Yankees are perhaps the biggest winner of the offseason , spending $ 114.25 million to keep their 125-win team intact . Must decide whether to trade for Cy Young winner Roger Clemens . <p> BOSTON RED SOX <p> ( 92-70 , lost in division playoffs ) <p> Kept Him : OF Darren Lewis . <p> Got Him : INF Jose Offerman , RHP Mark Portugal , RHP Bob Wolcott . <p> Lost Him : 1B Mo Vaughn , INF Mike Benjamin , 2B Mark Lemke , LHP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LHP Butch Henry , LHP Pete Schourek . <p> Wish List : Vaughn 's power at the plate and presence in the clubhouse will be hard to replace . Lost out on Bernie Williams and are left with few other options . Are talking to Tim Belcher as possible addition to pitching staff . <p> TORONTO BLUE JAYS <p> ( 88-74 ) <p> Kept Him : INF Tony Fernandez , INF Craig Grebeck , RHP Dave Stieb . <p> Got Him : OF Geronimo Berroa . <p> Lost Him : C Benito Santiago , OF Jose Canseco , 2B Juan Samuel . <p> Wish List : Need a power-hitting outfielder , third baseman and catcher .

Surhoff . <p> Got Him : LF Albert Belle , C Charles Johnson , RHP Mike Timlin , 2B Delino DeShields , 1B Will Clark . <p> Lost Him : 1B Rafael Palmeiro , 2B Roberto Alomar , OF Eric Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doug Drabek , LHP Jimmy Key , RHP Pete Smith . <p> Wish List : Perhaps the busiest team this offseason , but still resemble the rotisserie-style roster that led to the baseball 's highest-spending team finishing below .500 last season . A suitor for Kevin Brown , though it remains unlikely they can add pitching help they need . <p> TAMPA BAY DEVIL RAYS <p> ( 63-99 ) <p> Kept Him : 3B Wade Boggs . <p> Got Him : OF Jose Canseco . <p> Lost Him : RHP Dennis Springer . <p> Wish List : Scored the fewest runs in the majors last season , so offense , especially in the outfield , is a major need .
