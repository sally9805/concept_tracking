<p> IN PRAISE OF EARNED ECONOMIC INEQUALITY <p> Editor  --  Socialist Douglas Mattern ( Letters , June 9 ) deprecates the concentration of wealth under free-market capitalism . He says that capitalism has " created a condition where only 20 percent of the world 's population own 83 percent of the world 's wealth . " <p> But if 20 percent of the population produced 83 percent of the world 's wealth ( which they would have if capitalism were entirely responsible for that disparity ) , then they would deserve it . There is nothing wrong with economic inequality , if it is earned ! What is wrong is economic equality that is unearned  --  that is achieved by robbing the producers for the sake of the non- producers . <p> Nor does one have to own a proportional share of the wealth in order to enjoy a high standard of living , because under capitalism , as the rich get richer , the poor get richer . <p> Indeed , prosperity requires private ownership of the means of production . If you turn the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electorate ) and eliminate any profit motive , as you would under socialism , the only equality you 'll achieve is one of poverty . <p> WILLIAM DWYER <p> Hayward <p> . <p> LINCOLN 'S VISION <p> Editor  --  Douglas Mattern 's letter of June 9 wisely points out existing conditions which most of us in the middle class have probably not been completely aware . <p> It is obvious that the magnitude of corporate power in today 's times has been growing at an alarming rate . Power seems to breed more power and as a result the economic disparity , as Mattern states , has now grown to be one of the worst in the industrial nations . <p> The situation brings to mind a quotation by one of our most beloved far-seeing presidents  --  one who kept our nation together . <p> To quote  --  " I see in the future a crisis approaching that unnerves me . . . And causes me to tremble for the safety of my country . . . Corporations have been enthroned . . . An era of corruption in high places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor to prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the people . . . Until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands . . . and the Republic is destroyed . "  --  Abraham Lincoln , 1865 . <p> What do we , the general American populace , the non-tycoons , have to do to prevent the last five words from ever coming true ? <p> FRED BONNEY <p> Sonoma <p> . <p> A DYING TRIBE <p> Editor  --  As one of the few people who can legitimately claim to be a permanent resident of Death Valley proper , I read with interest the article entitled " The Noir Magic Kingdom " ( Sunday , June 8 ) . You see , I am one of the 300 members of the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe . And despite what others may say , our elders tell us that we have lived in the area now known as Death Valley from the beginning . We are taught that Coyote brought the people here and did not leave until he had finished his job of naming all the places for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before outsiders changed our valley , our people found a good living at the places Coyote named for them . <p> The story Carl T. Hall told is an old story that is being replayed for another generation of Timbisha Shoshone people . The story can best be summed up by repeating , " They get the gold . We get the shaft . " The " they " being park concessionaires , Inyo County , the C.R. Briggs open- pit cyanide mine and others familiar with the art of " delicate compromises . " <p> While the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe struggles to remain in Death Valley National Park , on a portion of their 12 million acres of ancestral homelands , backroom deals are struck between the politicians who now control the tribe 's land and those who seek to profit from it . <p> In truth , the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe is slowly dying . That is , the essential qualities that make the Timbisha Shoshone unique are being lost to time , neglect and politics . Historians , anthropologists and others with the skills to quantify such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture can be directly traced to the forced relocation of tribal members and the subsequent restrictions placed on their traditional way of life . <p> In the end , the Timbisha Shoshone 's people and ancestral lands are their only assets and the absence of one diminishes the value of the other . <p> RICHARD F. BOLAND <p> Death Valley <p> . <p> WORKING HEROES <p> Editor  --  Carl Hall 's article on Death Valley ( Sunday , June 8 ) was entertaining , but off the mark . It 's quite a stretch to blame environmentalists and the California Desert Protection Act for the Briggs open-pit mine . The act has assured that most of the park will not be mined  --  or overgrazed , or trashed by motorcycles . That was the whole point . <p> As for most of the " interesting desert characters " that Mr. Hall finds so intriguing , they fought against the park and have refused to join the current struggle against the antiquated 1872 Mining Law , the law that made the Briggs mine inevitable . Now they get to watch the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death Valley Scotty and the glorious hustler prospectors of yesteryear . <p> Mr. Hall should write an article on the real heroes of the desert , citizens who have been working diligently for its preservation and those public lands managers who have been courageous in upholding environmental laws . We 're still out here , we 're still working . <p> STEVE TABOR <p> Desert Survivors <p> Oakland <p> . <p> NOW AND PAULA JONES <p> Editor  --  In writing her column on Paula Jones and NOW ( Chronicle , May 30 ) , Debra Saunders accused NOW of joining the " liberal men 's club " and " not getting it . " Ms. Saunders suggests that NOW does n't understand that sexual harassment can affect women of all ethnic , social , professional and educational backgrounds . She also implies that NOW is hypocritical and willing to sell out a sister for political gain with the Democrats . Ms. Saunders , we must believe that you have not done your homework . <p> NOW does not ally itself with any one party . Our membership consists of feminists from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libertarian , Republican , Socialist , etc . We are very careful about where we pledge our alliance . We do n't rush to judgment . We always collect the facts before making our decision . <p> NOW has made continuous efforts to meet with Ms. Jones , but to no avail . On April 25 , 1997 , Operation Rescue spokesperson Pat Mahoney contacted NOW President Patricia Ireland , offering to set up a conference call with Ms. Jones and her lawyer at the time , Daniel Traylor . Ireland agreed to a 2:30 p.m. call on May 4 , but Jones failed to partake in the discussion . <p> Patricia Ireland has also offered to fly out to talk with Ms. Jones at NOW 's expense , but Ms. Jones ' representatives refused to set up a meeting . Instead of talking with Ireland , Ms. Jones has affiliated herself with such gentlemen as Pat Robertson , founder of the Christian Coalition , Randall Terry , founder of Operation Rescue , and David Brock , the author of a scathing and inaccurate book about Anita Hill . These men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates with . <p> We , the Board of San Francisco NOW , are insulted by the accusations in Ms. Saunders ' column . Saunders chose to put forth her opinions without researching the facts . We pride ourselves on our integrity and good judgment . Patricia Ireland says it best , " We wo n't force ourselves on an unwilling plaintiff , anymore than any man should force himself on a woman . " We remain available to Paula Jones when she is willing to sit down and talk about the facts . <p> BOARD OF DIRECTORS <p> San Francisco NOW <p> . <p> A FOREST 'S FATE <p> Editor  --  Many thanks for your editorial ( Sunday , June 15 ) entitled " Who Should Determine the Fate of a Forest , " alerting your readers to the threat posed by Representative Wally Herger 's bill , H.R. 858 . <p> The bottom line is , the magnificent Sierra forests to which that bill would apply are public forests , belonging to every citizen of this nation . No one group of individuals should be entitled to determine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed . <p> JOHANNA H. WALD <p> Natural Resources Defense Council <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> JOINED AT THE HIP <p> Editor  --  Why does The Chronicle feel compelled to offer Thomas M. Edwards free space to let us all know how much he 's going to miss his fellow Nazi of letters William Heller ( Sunday , Letters , June 15 ) ? And why in God 's name are you printing Heller 's idiotic comments about a statement James Carville made over two years ago ? ! <p> Have either one of these narrow- minded bigots ever offered a single original or even interesting thought or opinion in any one of their hundreds of letters your paper has insisted on publishing over the years ? The answer is a resounding no ! Which member ( or members ) of your editorial board are these two old farts sleeping with to warrant your continued publication of their boring , tired , cliched rants ? <p> DAVE ABSTON <p> San Francisco
