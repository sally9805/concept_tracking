Section : U.S. News Clinton must read the signals carefully if he wants to deliver growth on schedule <p> In the days leading up to this week 's economic parley in Little Rock , the voices vying for Bill Clinton 's ear have come to resemble competing squads in a beer commercial . Needs stimulus , ' cries one group . Cut deficit , ' shouts another . Of course , the president-elect ca n't do both simultaneously . Fiscal stimulus requires government to pump more money into the economy than it takes out , a maneuver that can only postpone deficit reduction . Clinton himself scrupulously pairs the two goals in every remark on the economy , but sometime between now and his budget message to Congress early next year he must make a choice : to stimulate or not to stimulate . <p> The case against fiscal stimulus grew stronger last week , when the government announced that retail sales rose for the fifth consecutive month and the Federal Reserve Board reported modest ' improvements in the nation 's manufacturing and home-building sectors . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawks Leon Panetta , chairman of the House Budget Committee , and Alice Rivlin , former director of the Congressional Budget Office . <p> Yet Clinton still fears for the economy , calling signs of recovery mixed and uncertain . ' And his counselors stress that economic growth and job creation are running at barely one third the pace of the 1982 recovery . Says Clinton adviser Gene Sperling , This country should n't have to lower its standards for what it considers a strong recovery . ' <p> If Clinton misreads the economic signals , the costs could be huge . Stimulating an economy that may have begun to heal could spook Wall Street , drive long-term interest rates from about 7.5 percent to more than 9 percent and choke off economic growth . Worse , Clinton would miss his best chance to begin deficit reduction . But if the current economic spurt fizzles out again , inaction by Clinton would leave 9 million unemployed workers with bleak prospects . Says Charles Schultze , head of Jimmy Carter 's Council of Economic Advisers , We 've already had two false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious blows to the national confidence . ' <p> The clamor for Clinton 's ear will continue long after the experts leave Little Rock this week . But his key decisions will turn on a series of calculations being churned out by economists at his transition headquarters and by the computers of private forecasters consulted by the Clinton team . Already , several points are clear : Clinton would like to see gross domestic product expanding by at least 2.5 percent in 1993 , compared with 2 percent during 1992 , to ensure faster job creation . He also wants to demonstrate fiscal discipline by giving Congress a package that spells out long-term deficit reductions , along with short-term job creation . And finally , the president-elect 's plan will follow Putting People First , ' the campaign document that called for $41.9 billion in new spending next year on infrastructure , education and research . Clinton 's choice , as he acknowledged last week , is whether to pay for this program entirely and immediately with other spending cuts and higher taxes or retool key components to provide short-term stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president-elect will be watching the economic indicators and studying his briefing book . After interviewing transition advisers and private-sector economists , U.S. News has pieced together some of the critical options that Clinton is likely to find in that loose-leaf binder . SCENARIO 1 : Stagnant growth Economic conditions : In this glum scenario , the confidence that accompanied Clinton 's election expires by January , consumer spending collapses and , for the third time in three years , the economy falters . GDP growth drops below 2 percent . And employers create just 54,000 jobs per month  --  about one sixth the pace of the 1982 recovery  --  pushing the unemployment rate back up to 7.4 percent in 1993 . Policy options : This grim prospect would vindicate the Keynesian pump-primers in Clinton 's camp , who insist that the recovery remains fragile . The Economic Policy Institute , a Washington think tank co-founded by Clinton 's Labor Secretary-designate Robert Reich , last month called for fiscal stimulus of $60 billion in 1993 , including a whopping $50 billion on infrastructure and $10 billion in investment tax credits to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say $60 billion is within the range of possibilities and that public-works spending and an investment tax credit could be administered in bigger doses if the recovery falters . Consequences : A stimulus package of $60 billion would nudge GDP growth from about 2 percent to 3 percent by 1994 , while cutting the unemployment rate from its current 7.2 percent to 5.7 percent . But it would also seriously delay Clinton 's campaign to cut the federal budget deficit . EPI 's stimulus model would raise the federal deficit to $298 billion in fiscal 1993 , from $287 billion in fiscal 1992 , but then reduce it again to $280 billion in 1994 because economic growth boosts federal tax revenues and cuts outlays for the unemployed . <p> There could be problems if the economy turns out to be much stronger by next summer than this scenario assumes . Forecasters at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc. estimate that economic stimulus on top of a vigorous recovery would push economic growth to a rapid 4.2 percent in 1994 but would also drive consumer price inflation to 4.5 percent in 1994 . With inflation-fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be expected to ratchet up short-term interest rates . That could stifle recovery and put Clinton back in the economic soup as the 1996 presidential election approaches . Worse , says a Clinton adviser , Then you 've blown your best shot at serious deficit reduction . ' SCENARIO 2 : Slow growth Economic conditions : Most economists think the economy has enough steam to keep huffing and puffing along at a modest 2 to 3 percent growth rate . While this scenario leaves the unemployment rate at 7.2 percent for most of 1993 , it raises monthly job creation to 81,000 next year . Such growth would probably erase fears of a triple-dip recession , but Clinton and his advisers assert that this growth would be lame compared with the 1982 recovery , when employers added some 315,000 jobs a month . Policy options : This scenario seems tailor-made for Clinton 's Putting People First ' program , which blames the slow recovery on structural problems such as excessive borrowing and inadequate investment but promises to fix those problems while creating some jobs quickly . Clinton 's investment tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business investment but would rapidly generate jobs as factories produced new equipment . An additional strength of this course is its likely reception on Capitol Hill . Says Montana Sen. Max Baucus , a Democrat on the Finance Committee , Some short-term stimulus seems appropriate , so long as it 's contained in what should be a long-term plan . ' Consequences : Putting People First ' promises to pay for itself each year  --  and even reduce the deficit by perhaps $27 billion next year . But most experts say it will enlarge the deficit by about $20 billion in 1993 , and Clinton himself joked last week that he 's willing to let Panetta teach me some math . ' Such a stimulus could nudge GDP growth to more than 3 percent , raise monthly job creation to nearly 117,000 and push unemployment below 7 percent . <p> This middle course poses risks on the upside as well as the downside . If the economy were to fall back below 2 percent growth , a stimulus of $20 billion  --  a mere one third of 1 percent of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face lobbying for greater stimulus just when he hopes to move on to deficit reduction . Should the economy prove more robust , however , it could prompt the Fed to up the key federal funds rate from about 3.5 percent to 5 percent by 1994 . But if Clinton weds short-term stimulus to significant long-term deficit reduction , he gives himself an escape hatch . Says Charles Schultze , Then he can go to Greenspan and say : Look , man , I 've got my program in place . Give me a little help . ' ' SCENARIO 3 : Surprising growth Economic conditions : There is a slim chance that Americans will give in to years of pent-up demand and touch off a wave of spending next year . In this scenario , GDP grows at 3.4 percent in 1993 and climbs to 3.9 percent in 1994 . The unemployment rate falls to 6.6 percent by late 1993 . And job creation jumps to 247,000 jobs per month by 1994 . Policy options : In this scenario , the case for short-term stimulus erodes badly . But such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit . It would also strengthen the hand of the budget hawks . The Progressive Policy Institute , a moderate Democratic think tank close to Clinton , has just released a blueprint that calls on the president-elect to boost federal investment in infrastructure , training and civilian R &D; by $38.6 billion in 1993 . The study also stresses fiscal discipline ' and enumerates spending cuts and several new taxes to trim the deficit to $177 billion by 1996 . Consequences : Analysts say the PPI program would do little to boost job creation or economic growth in the short run because it provides no net stimulus . Still , it would shift billions of dollars in federal outlays from consumption to investment spending . And together with its deficit reduction , this could improve productivity . But if the economy turns out by mid-1993 to be much weaker than forecast , and Clinton is cutting spending , there would be little he could do but ask the Fed for a monetary lifeline  --  rapid cuts in interest rates . <p> Bill Clinton is a student of political history . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside John Kennedy , who astutely cut federal income taxes in 1963 and touched off a seven-year expansion . If Clinton misreads the economy , however , he could go down with Jimmy Carter , who mistimed his stimulus proposal in early 1977 , changed his mind a few months later and was faulted for losing control of both Congress and the economy . President-elect Clinton has about seven weeks to prescribe a cure for this ailing economy and to prepare his place in the history books . STAGNANT GROWTH <p> Economic conditions : Recovery fizzles ; growth falls below 2 percent . <p> Policy options : $60 billion in tax incentives and public-works programs <p> Consequences : A modest recovery but no deficit reduction SLOW GROWTH <p> Economic conditions : The economy grows at a subdued 2 to 3 percent . <p> Policy options : Long-term investments in education , infrastructure and research , with gradual deficit reduction <p> Consequences : Economic growth moves above 3 percent but job creation remains subpar versus previous recoveries . SURPRISING GROWTH <p> Economic conditions : Pent-up demand takes hold , pushing economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in research , education and infrastructure , paid for with sharp cuts in government subsidies and reforms to Social Security and Medicare <p> Consequences : Federal spending is shifted from consumption toward investment , and the deficit falls almost 40 percent to $177 billion by 1996 . <p> BILL CLINTON 'S CALENDAR <p> Over the next seven weeks , Clinton and his team will study every scrap of economic data they can get their hands on . Here are the key measures that will be analyzed : <p> DEC. 23 <p> Personal income Clinton will be looking to see if Americans ' wages are picking up . <p> DEC. 29 <p> Consumer confidence The president-elect will want to know if confidence is still on an upward path . <p> JAN. 4 <p> Purchasing managers index If Clinton sees manufacturing production and employment expanding , he may cut back his stimulus plans . <p> JAN. 8 <p> Employment All eyes  --  including the president-elect 's  --  will be on the crucial job growth numbers . <p> JAN. 15 <p> Prices Clinton hopes to see low levels of inflation continue so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending President Clinton will scan loan figures for an end to the credit crunch . <p> JAN. 28 <p> Growth Fourth-quarter GDP is a key number in Clinton 's calculus . The question is whether third-quarter growth will be sustained . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS : ( JACK DESROCHER FOR USN &WR); <p> By David Hage <p> With Robert F. Black and Sara Collins <p> The Fed 's Greenspan THE FORGOTTEN MAN IN CLINTON 'S PLANS <p> Bill Clinton stepped into the intense glare of white-hot lights last week and proudly introduced the first members of his administration 's economic team in Little Rock . Meanwhile , back in Washington , the forgotten man in Clinton 's economic plans  --  66-year-old Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  --  quietly mulled the statistics and churned the data . Ironically , Greenspan 's analysis could have a greater impact on Clinton 's political future and the course of the American economy than almost any proposal put forth by the president-elect 's new band of economic advisers . <p> Clinton obviously understands Greenspan 's power . Two days after the Fed chairman said he might reduce money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts believe could retard nascent economic growth  --  he flew down to Little Rock for a chat that was designed to lay the groundwork for a productive relationship ' with the president-elect . Clinton also understands that Greenspan 's calibrations have frequently been off the mark during the current period of economic turmoil . In 1988 , for example , the Fed head implemented his soft landing ' policy , which suppressed money growth and boosted interest rates in small increments . This approach failed and helped push the economy into recession . By shrinking the money supply , the Fed also reduced the funds available for bank loans and contributed to a credit crunch . The lending squeeze intensified when banks , struggling to rebuild balance sheets , refused to extend credit . Even after fears of a Persian Gulf oil crisis subsided , Greenspan seemed overly concerned about inflation . That 's why the central bank tightened the money supply once again , despite signs of a deteriorating economy . Many analysts say the Fed was also too slow in bringing down interest rates during the depths of recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself whether such miscalculations , which badly wounded the Bush administration , will be repeated during his presidency . The concerns could be well-founded , especially if Greenspan 's Fed keeps constraining money growth in an effort to eradicate inflation . With excess capacity , weak wage growth and price deflation at its lowest level in 25 years , inflation currently hovers at just 1.7 percent and is no longer America 's economic enemy No. 1 ( chart , below ) . What 's more , most analysts expect this subdued trend to carry over into the foreseeable future . Should Greenspan 's anti-inflationary zeal continue unabated in today 's uncertain economic environment , some argue that he could frustrate national prosperity once again . The costs of beating out the last bits of inflation can be very high , and the benefits may not be great , ' writes economist Lawrence Summers , who was a contender for chairman of Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers . <p> Dealing with the tightfisted Greenspan , a Republican whose term expires eight months before the next presidential election in 1996 , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to create jobs , boost incomes and generate economic growth . But he can not ignore the forgotten man of the Fed , who worries that Clintonomics could deepen deficits and ignite inflation . Choking off inflation  --  and growth <p> The Federal Reserve Board has helped reduce inflation to the lowest level in 25 years , but job and income growth have suffered in the process .
