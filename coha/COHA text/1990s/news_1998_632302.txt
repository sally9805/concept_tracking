<p> There 's a new game in town  --  the Roth individual retirement account  --  and you 're about to be inundated with messages from financial institutions that want you to start a new Roth IRA with them or convert your old IRA to a new Roth IRA . <p> Here 's a basic guide to how the Roth IRA works  --  as well as answers to the most-asked Roth IRA questions . We 'll even give you sample comparisons of the ultimate investment returns on the two IRAs , as well as places to get work sheets and computer programs so you can determine how the alternatives would work for you . <p> There could be some big decisions to be made this year , even this month . Do n't miss out on some potential tax benefits by deciding to " think about it tomorrow ! " Now is the time to consider whether your old traditional IRAs or your rollover IRA from a previous company retirement plan might grow far greater in a new Roth IRA . <p> Our Roth IRA tax expert is Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints the tax law and interpretations . <p> What is it ? <p> A Roth IRA is based on a simple concept : You pay your income taxes going into this investment , instead of on the way out . <p> Starting in 1998 , you have a choice of investing $ 2,000 a year in a new Roth IRA instead of a traditional IRA . When you invest in a Roth IRA , you do not get to deduct that $ 2,000 from your income taxes . This is an after-tax contribution . But no matter how much the money grows through investments over the years , you will not pay any taxes when you take the money out  --  subject to certain restrictions . <p> If you have long enough to let your money grow , that can make a big difference . For example , if you contribute $ 2,000 a year to a Roth IRA for 30 years and earn 10 percent a year , you 'll have close to $ 362,000 in your retirement account  --  all tax-free . In a traditional IRA , your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it all out at once and pay at a 28 percent tax rate , you 'll have only $ 277,000  --  a difference of about $ 85,000 . <p> You might end up with a bit more if you 'd taken your tax savings every year from putting money in the deductible IRA and invested that money in a taxable account . Still , in the long run , the Roth IRA would have returned more  --  all other things being equal . <p> Who can contribute ? <p> If you are single and have modified adjusted gross income ( AGI ) below $ 95,000 or are married and filing a joint return with AGI below $ 150,000 , you are eligible to contribute up to $ 2,000 each to a Roth IRA . If you earn slightly more  --  up to $ 110,000 for singles and $ 160,000 for married couples  --  you can make only a partial contribution . If your AGI is higher , you are not eligible for a Roth IRA . <p> Remember , your AGI is income from work and investments  --  minus certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage interest and charitable contributions . If you are married but filing a separate return , you can not contribute to a Roth IRA . <p> You may make a contribution to a Roth IRA even if you also participate in a company retirement plan such as a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) plan for nonprofit organizations . <p> When can I withdraw money ? <p> You can take all of your after-tax contributions out at any time with no penalty because you 've already paid taxes on this money . <p> You can take any earnings or gains out of the Roth IRA tax-free if you are at least 59 1/2 years old and have had your Roth IRA for at least five years . <p> The money also can be withdrawn tax-free if , after it has been in the account at least five years , the owner has died or become disabled or if the money ( up to $ 10,000 ) is being used to purchase a first home . <p> Also , starting in 1998 , money can be withdrawn from any IRA , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is used for higher-education expenses for the IRA owner or a family member . <p> What 's the difference ? <p> The major difference between a Roth IRA and a traditional deductible IRA is the fact that instead of withdrawing the money at retirement and paying ordinary income tax on the withdrawals , you will be able to withdraw all of the money in your Roth IRA tax-free . <p> But there are other potentially important differences . First , your contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars . Second , the Roth IRA does not require that you start taking money out when you reach age 70 1/2 , as you must with a traditional IRA . This gives your money longer to grow , if you do not need to use it for living expenses when you retire . And even if you do withdraw some of the money , you are not subject to the complicated formulas required for minimum withdrawals that come with a traditional IRA . <p> In addition , unlike with a traditional IRA , you can continue to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have earned income . <p> A Roth IRA may have some estate-tax planning implications . As part of your estate , your Roth IRA is subject to federal estate taxes . And beneficiaries have to follow certain withdrawal rules , depending on whether your beneficiary is your spouse or another person , including your child . But the money will be withdrawn by the beneficiary free from taxes , unlike funds from a traditional IRA . <p> Also , money taken out of a traditional IRA at retirement may have an effect on your income level and thus the taxability of your Social Security benefits . But ( unless Congress defines this in the clarification bill ) Roth IRA withdrawals , which are tax-free , will not affect the taxation of your Social Security benefits . <p> Roth or traditional IRA ? <p> Almost everyone will be better off in the long run with a Roth IRA . Especially if you have been making non-deductible IRA contributions , you 'll want to take advantage of a Roth IRA . <p> After all , the money that builds up inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress keeps its promise . That difference will be especially beneficial if you 're willing to make some higher-risk investments inside your Roth IRA . If the market works in your favor , you could have large gains that you 'll be able to withdraw tax-free . <p> On the other hand , many people need the tax deduction now , to have the cash to put into their traditional IRA . If you 're in the 30 percent tax bracket , it means that nearly one-third of your contribution is money that would have gone to the government in taxes anyway . So it 's more attractive to put $ 2,000 into a deductible IRA . In effect , the government is paying part of your traditional IRA contribution . <p> Where can I invest in a Roth IRA ? <p> Any bank , brokerage firm or mutual fund company should be able to accept your Roth IRA money . This account will be kept separate from existing traditional IRAs that you might have at the same institution , and will have a special designation . <p> You might choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to secure large gains that will remain untaxed . Thus , while CDs , a money market account or a short-term bond fund might have caught your attention for a traditional IRA , you might choose a high-yield bond fund for your Roth IRA . And if you chose conservative stock mutual funds for your current IRA , you might consider a more speculative small-cap fund to generate gains inside the Roth IRA . <p> These choices , of course , will depend on your personal risk tolerance and your overall investment objectives . <p> Roth IRA or my company 40l(k) ? <p> The answer to your question is : Invest in both plans ! As noted above , unlike traditional IRAs , there is no restriction on Roth IRA contributions if you are covered by a company plan of any type . Your company plan contribution is pre-tax , but eventually the proceeds will all come out and be taxed as ordinary income . Still , if your company is matching all or part of your contribution , you will come out far ahead in the company plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute as much as $ 10,000 to a company 40l(k) plan in 1998 . So start with the company plan , but if you can manage a contribution to both plans , do so . That will allow you to get both taxable and tax-free income after you retire . <p> Should I convert to a Roth ? <p> The idea of being able to take all the money out of a Roth IRA completely tax-free at retirement is so compelling that many people are considering converting their traditional IRA that has grown over the years to a Roth IRA . The conversion feature is especially enticing if you have an IRA rollover account from a company where you previously worked . <p> These traditional IRAs can be converted or transferred to a new Roth IRA , with no 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal , if you 're willing to pay taxes now on all of the money in your old account . That 's the hitch . You 'll have to pay ordinary income taxes on all of the gains in your current IRA and then roll it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money earned by the new account will come out of the Roth IRA completely tax-free if you meet the Roth distribution rules such as holding the account for five years and being older than 59 1/2 . <p> Who can convert ? <p> You are eligible to convert all or part of your old IRA if your adjusted gross income is less than $ 100,000 in the year you convert . That $ 100,000 limit applies to singles and married couples . The amount of your IRA conversion is not included in that income limit , although it must be included in your taxable income for the year . <p> There 's a special offer for people who convert from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 1998 . You 'll be able to spread the additional income ( and therefore the tax obligation ) equally over the next four years . For example , if you converted a $ 100,000 IRA rollover account to a Roth IRA , you 'd have to add $ 25,000 to current income over each of the next four years , starting in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . <p> How to pay taxes if you convert <p> It would be best to pay the taxes out of other savings , held outside your old IRA account . If you have to take the tax money out of your old IRA , you would owe a 10 percent penalty on that amount . But , even more importantly , you would not have that money growing for you in your new Roth IRA . The ability to pay your taxes with other money you have saved could make all the difference in your decision about whether to convert to a Roth IRA . <p> Fortunately , some financial institutions have created work sheets or computer programs to help you make this decision . There are a lot of variables , such as the amount of money in the IRA you 're considering converting , your current age , your estimate of investment returns ( based on the risks you 're willing to assume ) , your current tax bracket , and your expected tax bracket when you take the money out at retirement . <p> T.

Traditional retirement plans require you to pay ordinary income taxes at withdrawal . Other investments subject your money to capital gains taxes . <p> So the Roth IRA is a real opportunity , especially for younger people , to let your money grow outside the tax system . As long as Congress keeps its promise  --  and if you have good investment judgment  --  you 'll come out ahead in the long run . Study the rules , and take action now . <p> Terry Savage is a registered investment adviser for both stocks and commodities and is on the board of directors of McDonald 's Corp .
