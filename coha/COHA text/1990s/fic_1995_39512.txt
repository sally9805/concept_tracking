TATE MCCALL STARED OUT from under the shade of his tree . Something tall and dark barreled toward him . Up close it turned into a man who said , " I 'm sorry to wake you , Mr. Tate . " <p> " You did n't wake me up . I 'm not asleep . " <p> " He 's been asleep under that tree ten minutes . " His wife , Allie , unlatched the door to the old lean-to back porch and looked out . <p> " I thought I heard someone catching z 's . " The man grinned . <p> " What can I do for you , young fellow " <p> " I 'm here to read the meter . " The boy rapped his breast pocket with his flashlight , where stitching read either his name or that of his company . Tate could n't make it out . <p> " The meter 's over ... " <p> " Have mercy , Tate . He knows where the meter is . " <p> The boy stared at him as if expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , " I 'm Rich Peters . " One thing Tate knew , Rich Peters was n't married . The boy went on , " My daddy 's Gene . He says he knows you . He saw yours and Miss Allie 's picture in the paper about your fiftieth anniversary . He thought that picture might have been taken a while back ? " <p> " Twenty years ago , " Tate said , smiling . " How is he " <p> " Doing all right for ... " and Rich Peters swallowed and said , " He 's fine . " <p> Doing all right for an old man , Tate thought . The fellow 's feet went off , and Tate got up ; he had to finish cutting his grass before that party tomorrow . The weather was so hot . He sat down a minute , his cap pulled low . I was n't asleep , Tate told himself . <p> His stomach grumbled when it was only eleven o'clock . Maybe he ought to eat something : him in the kitchen by himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . This time tomorrow the party would nearly be here . Tate looked toward it with dread and worry , and had to get his grass cut by then . <p> He set a brown-spotted hand on each knee . Their veins , dark and purple , jumped out , his blood always rushing to his thin skin 's surface and staying there . He would not show any effort getting up ; he meant to remain silent . The young man 's feet loitered on the edge of his eyesight ; he was no closer to the door where Allie stood , teetering on the sill , holding onto the door more than holding it open . After her recent hip replacement she did n't seem to be doing better . She was still on a cane , still hobbling about , still making soft little cries when she got up . He wondered if they were not two pitiful people batting around the house , Allie sometimes barking orders like she was Lord and Master when what she was was a crippled-up old woman with a tendency toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seventy-five years each . But they 'd had some bad luck about health . Some nights , lying awake , Tate prayed neither of them would have a stroke . <p> His arteries were corroded and could not be cleaned out again  --  he 'd had triple bypass surgery . His doctor in Memphis said he might not come out of any more anesthetic ; he could not risk going under any more knives . " Mr. McCall 's a walking miracle , " the doctor said . One time he said , " He does n't get enough oxygen to the brain , you know , " speaking in a low tone and thinking Tate could not overhear him . Allie was all the time telling people , " Tate 's getting so he ca n't hear thunder , " when she was the one going deaf . Tate could see her in his mind 's eye this minute , head cocked , eyes looking inward , and finally admitting . to the other fellow what she had to admit to herself , " I did n't hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear something , did n't let on about it . Most folks did n't say much worth hearing anyway , was his estimate . He walked away letting folks wonder if he heard or not . <p> The boy 's feet were coming back . " Can I help you up ? " he said , Rich something-or-other . The young man was about to grab hold of him like somebody trying to help a hurt bird by one wing . Tate clutched his arms to himself , said , " I can do it , " and added , " Thanks . " <p> He remembered the name " Gene " had come up , and he used to know a Gene Peters in Nashtoba : might be the boy 's daddy ; probably was . With his spotted hands on khaki knees , Tate stood up . For a minute , bolts of red , blue , and violet shot through his eyes . When his sight cleared , he said , " I 've got to cut this grass . " <p> " It 's mighty hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy stood directly in front of the sun again , a dark shadow , blotting it out the way he had before . <p> " Tate , do n't cut any more grass in this heat , " Allie called . " You 've done enough . " <p> She was probably right , he thought . Drat it . The door swung out as she spoke , and if it swung any farther , Allie was going to fly straight into the air , like a chicken let out of a coop . She did n't have her cane with her , was practicing walking around the house without it . " You should have started days earlier if you wanted all this cut by tomorrow , " she said . <p> Tate said nothing , and the boy pretended not to have heard her . " Ca n't somebody do it for him " he asked . <p> Tate shook his fist , thinking I can do it myself " You ca n't get anybody in the country to do any work , " Allie said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother says white people are taking up the slack . She 's got white women coming to clean house . " <p> " You do n't mean to tell me . That has n't happened in the country , not yet , " Allie said . " I guess it will , though . Everything else has changed . " <p> She started shoving the door closed over a warped wooden floor , shutting herself and that boy into what Tate considered his private world , the quiet back porch , sealed against the weather with plastic sheeting when it used to stand open and screened-in . Being in it was like being in a storm cloud , troubled , gray , and nearly airless . And what was she doing in it ? Probably she was out there just to let the boy in , or to rummage around in that freezer of hers for the party tomorrow . <p> That freezer was stocked up against some rainy day in the next century . In their two lifetimes they would never eat up what-all was in there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' worth of food if the power went out , or the box went bust . Sometimes he thought of fooling with the coils himself just to prove he could be right . <p> Was she getting ready for that party tomorrow ? Who was coming Their nieces and nephews giving the party put a write-up in the county paper , The Democrat , saying " Friends and Family Are Invited . " " Might be two folks show up , might be two hundred , " somebody commented . Shoot , Tate thought . He did n't know two hundred folks alive any longer . <p> He went toward the tractor , smelling his cut grass . He stopped outside the sheeting , where two shadows were etched , and thought maybe Allie had that freezer stocked up to prove something : if a woman had that much food left over , she had to have been living , did n't she ? She was telling the boy , " All he 's got left to do is cut grass . And go to Whitehill twice a day to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he ca n't drive . He 'll have to tell him . I could n't . " <p> " I thought Mr. Tate used to have some cows " <p> " He could n't take care of them . Had to give them up spring before last . " <p> My foot , Tate thought . She was as bad off as he was . Maybe worse . <p> Allie 's greatest fear was she 'd go before he did . He heard her tell folks , " Tate ca n't live by himself . He never has , and never will . " He let her go on thinking he was deafer than he was because that way he heard a lot . <p> He had gone straight from his mother 's house into the army and then , on one weekend leave , into getting married . What had been the hurry ? The war ; that 's what . Everything had been speeded up . There was not going to be any tomorrow . That was what all the songs , the sermons , the talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known ... there had been a million tomorrows . <p> He thought about standing before the Baptist preacher with a license he and Allie rushed over to Nashtoba and got so quick the ink might not have been dry . Maybe it was n't legal . Tate scratched under his cap brim now , wondering . Fif-ty years , he told himself in a solemn manner , measured and nearly funereal . <p> Back then he had been a free agent except for the army and his mother telling him what to do . The next minute there had been all this fiddling among the womenfolk just like for this party tomorrow , and he had been caught up in it  --  till now he felt he ought to shout out to somebody , Watch out , Brother <p> Suddenly his heart hurt  --  unwarranted ; unexpected . Just the way the doctor told him it could happen . The place in his chest felt like a panic button . He wanted to cry out for help . He could not imagine an empty half of bed without Allie when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his side and she on hers . <p> Sometimes the cat , Miss Kitty , slept in the bed with them . Under guise of being a tame calico , she was a wild creature . He thought of her eyes in the dark , lightening and darkening , signaling something . When she was in bed between them , it was nice having something soft , cozy , furry down in that hollow . He would never be able to endure the house by himself , sit before TV daily and nightly the way they did now , though he was not that interested , without Allie 's explanations and her guessing aloud before the contestants ' answers to " Wheel of Fortune " or " Jeopardy . " <p> What was his alternative ? The Sunset Rest Home over in Nashtoba , where there were bars on the windows and folks in white uniforms tied you into chairs with bedsheets . He 'd been over there visiting folks who did n't have any more idea than a jackrabbit who he was , or themselves , either , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic toward another room . He could not let himself be caught malingering , standing empty-handed , because under such circumstances Allie always looked at him queerly , asking , What are you doing , Tate We never found voice to answer , Thinking , woman . <p> Tate hiked off , jealous about his porch . Time had passed , and he had given up farming , then his cattle . He took up a little housekeeping to spare Allie and her arthritis on days the cleaning girl did n't come . A man 's got to do something Now part of his daily experience was sweeping up after Kitty McCall . The cat had come to the door unbidden one day , mewling and crying  --  and Tate opened it to her widely , saying , " You found us , did you ? " his heart widening too in love and affection and the need to take care of something . <p> He swept up cat hairs , clumps , from wherever Puss landed on her soft feet . Those hairs , crumbs , the dust that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory piles in front of his toes before he swept them into a dustpan . Then he washed his and Allie 's few minor dishes . They never did talk about a division of chores ; things just evolved . He made up his side of the bed , and she made up hers . <p> Out on the porch were the washer and dryer . Going around the house , it was easy for him to pick up Allie 's slip on a chair , her nightgown not hung up , his wash-and-wear shirt on a doorknob , underdrawers where he stepped out of them . Tate liked watching the soap powder pour in , the blue , eddying swirl that carried him to some distant thought of Niagara Falls . He had always believed he would go there someday with whomever he married . Probably because as a boy he collected tinted postcards with pictures of places . That was how he went somewhere , too , looking at scenes scattered in his boyhood drawer . He liked the dependability of cycles , the recurring WASH RINSE HOLD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture like rain or tears . <p> " Tate , " Allie would say from her lounger , pained legs up , " there 's no human reason to wash every day for two people . And leave my things alone . You 've ruint enough putting them in the dryer when they 're not supposed to go . " <p> Allie stayed busy as a hornets ' nest making things for a crafts fair . All year she painted , crocheted , sewed , made tiny , glittery Christmas and hair ornaments from fish scales , painted in the right season to look like poinsettias . She made tie tacks and lapel pins from the tiniest unopened cotton bolls , which they collected in the fall . She was creative , she was good She outsold everybody . Allie said in a later lifetime she 'd have been a business person up in Memphis , with a shop , instead of a housekeeper with no housekeeping left to do . <p> Round a corner of the house , Tate saw a tractor tire going flat . Kneeling to inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up The nieces and nephews told Allie not to do anything about this party ; she was one-half of its honored guests . Yet here came another of the nieces up the driveway , spattering gravel , to borrow something else . Ruthie got out of her car , saying , " I came to see if Aunt Allie 's got a big ice tea pitcher . And some punch cups . " <p> After a few puzzled seconds , she said , " Can I help you up " Since Tate frequently said nothing , she did not wait long for an answer . " Are n't you excited Aunt Allie says she 's thrilled to death about tomorrow . It 's her most exciting day , I guess . That is , except for getting married " Ruthie went on cozily toward the house . A cateress was doing the party but everybody was pitching in . <p> Cateress ? Tate thought . It sounded like a party too fancy for him . Maybe the party would be the biggest excitement Allie 'd had since  --  well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . He looked back over that fuzzy wartime experience , the wedding and honeymoon , all two nights ' worth of it . 1942 ; Lord help us , Tate said to himself . <p> The first night in Memphis he thought Allie was going to bleed to death , worse than any stuck pig he 'd ever seen . She told him , " At least you know you got a virgin . " He did not tell her that did n't make a fig 's worth of difference to him . Nookey was nookey no matter how you looked at it . <p> The second night one of his brothers arrived , having driven all the way from Nashtoba to carry him to the ball game . " Just arrived ? " Allie gasped when Sheldon phoned up from the Peabody 's lobby . Sheldon thought they were yokels who did n't know what to do in a city for a night , Allie said . Tate remembered that what he 'd had in mind was taken care of by that box of Kotex on the toilet tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get it on good , that was not information he wanted to know about his bride . He was excited about seeing the Memphis Chicks play ; they had a one-armed fellow on the team . He could no longer remember the man 's name . <p> But Tate recalled Allie in the stands with her wedding corsage quivering , lips set , arms folded , and madder than forty wet hens through an extra inning . Allie said she never was hick enough to wear a corsage to a ball game . Maybe she had been mad ever since ? Tate stuck a blade of grass in his mouth to think about that . <p> They made him a mess sergeant down at Camp Shelby . There was nothing you could tell the Army ; they told you . Just because he was a Mississippi country boy did n't mean he knew how to boil water . He did n't . And his mother might have been a Mississippi widow-lady , but black folks did all her work . Country biscuits appeared on the table every morning along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corroded . There was fried quail , home-cured pork , sausage , bacon , and country ham so salty you drank a gallon of sweetmilk to get : over it , There he was one morning , twelve years old , sopping up redeye gravy with biscuits when his father , opposite , put down a greased chin toward a belly he could n't button his shirt over . " Run quick . Get Dr. Crowley , " screamed the Negro woman working for them at the time , old Stella . His mother was in bed , where she stayed mostly those years . <p> Tate could hear again the whoosh of corduroy knickers rubbing as he made tracks down the road . He had bolted straight into the man 's kitchen , where the doctor was eating , too , and shouted , " It 's Poppa . " Dr. Crowley got up and had them back down that dust-track road in his Ford in two minutes . Spirits rose up off these country roads , they 'd walk with you too , and Dr. Crowley in spirit told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bless this house . Now you 're head of it . " <p> But that had not happened . His mother got out of the sickbed , brushed her night table clear of Lydia Pinkham 's and the other female remedies of the time , laced with morphine . Many of the ladies went around with sweet , smiling , agreeable dispositions from drinking enough syrup . Arvenia McCall never had another sick minute till she died of a stroke in her late eighties . She grew more strong-minded . When professional ball scouts came around looking over boys playing in their leagues in pastures , one of them tapped Tate . He would have had to go to St. Louis . His mother put her foot down . <p> Rich Peters , stalking up behind him , said , " Your tire 's going flat , Mr. Tate . " <p> " I can see it is , young man . " <p> " Maybe Miss Allie 's right . You 've cut enough . You 've done the front , and that 's all folks will see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Tate said , " Yes , " staring over his toes at his grass , at the road through town , to a building where a black sign read " Itna Homa Volunteer Fire Department . " The fire truck sat in a shed where coats and boots were stored . The main building was available for anybody 's function . Thirty or so years ago when the fire department started , Tate had been one of its first volunteers . <p> " Playing firemen , " the womenfolk teased the men , while taking perfectly seriously their jobs ' importance . When the signal went out , as if over the universe , Ugh Ugh Ugh like a cough , hearts rose into throats . Tate remembered some of the old excitement . He said to Rich Peters , " I wanted to get my grass cut . " <p> Tate considered the tractor an old friend , and he was afraid he and It would play out : Give up the ghost , he often said . He did not want to buy another even if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he was . Running it was fun . Chance . He never knew if it was going to start or stop . He depended on the tractor now to help him get back up . Once the boy was gone , he would grab hold of it and hoist . He said , " Son , you do n't know what somebody 's going to see . Or do , either . Folks have been running in and out of here for weeks . Folks we have n't seen in a hundred years are liable to turn up tomorrow , come up here to see how we live and what we 've got . " Go away talking behind our backs , too ; he knew that much . He was liable not to know anybody . <p> Maybe he could get out of going ? Play sick . Play dead . He would complain of a headache , a bellyache , a pain in his new heart , or stick a finger down his throat and vomit . They would drag him there anyhow , and he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stretcher , feet first in and feet first out , the way he was going out soon . He had to attend the party because he was one-half of its honored guests . Married fifty years . <p> He hated for the meter man to see his faded , dented truck . It was parked under the shade of an elm . Worn out like the rest of us , Tate thought . It was n't that he could n't buy a new truck ; he could . But he was tired of replacing the old with the new , clogged arteries with cleaned-out ones , a true heart with one of plastic , a hip of bone with one of metal . Nothing seemed real anymore . Sometimes at night , he thought he heard Allie 's new hip clanking beside him . Before she got it , the old one sounded as if it needed oil . <p> Ruthie and Allie came out . " Tate , " Allie said , " do n't stay out here getting heatstroke , you . hear ? " Then she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried , putting her hands over her face . Tate could not help thinking , Peek-a-boo . But this was serious . " Why did you prune them to the very ground " she asked . Allie 's eyes shone the color of little wild violets in the grass in summertime . She turned to Ruthie . " Men will always do it when they do n't have something else to do . Just prune prune prune . Cut cut cut . Those bushes are ruint . They 'll never flower again in my lifetime . " <p> Under his cap brim Tate said to himself , Ruined . He wondered where Allie got the word 's misuse when , having taught school , she prided herself on knowing more than the next fellow . Every morning she worked the crossword puzzle in the Memphis paper till each block was covered . She had a lot of dictionaries : Latin , French , German , he did n't know what-all . Still , when she did n't know something , Allie was not embarrassed to ask . Tate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when she did n't hear , head cocked , eyes indrawn , that questioning , thinking look of a bird . She always had to ask him sports questions . What 's the name of the home run king , Babe ... ? Anybody would know that , but sometimes he would n't be able to think . Who was the Say Hey Kid ? It was not , he 'd think , Mickey Mantle . By the time he remembered , yesterday 's paper would be in the trash . It would seem to Tate he had to go a long way back in time to remember . Legendary figures , events , faded into somebody else 's experience , not his own . His own lifetime seemed to be still ahead , peopled with figures and events yet to come . <p> Ruthie got in her car with her arms loaded and spattered back down the driveway . " Well , " she had said , looking like a scared pet rabbit . Tate was her uncle , but Allie was clearly in the right about those flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flew away to the silent emptiness of the countryside . <p> Allie said , " Well , " too , stricken and resigned . Tate smirked under his cap brim , thinking of another child 's rejoinder : " Well 's a deep hole in the ground . " Allie went inside to the allure of whatever soap story was on . The meter man pretended not to see those bushes either , and Tate , his face shaded , peeking , thought they did look mighty low to the ground : mighty . Like overgrown mushrooms . He did not remember clipping so much as he remembered a sense of satisfaction about going around and around , a feeling of completion , that you started on one side and met yourself on the other . He remembered from another lost time the sound of horses ' hooves , the way now he faintly remembered the click of shears . <p> Rich Peters needed to be off . He looked as if he wanted to say something . But he was only a service person , paid to come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually about the weather . " It 's faired up nicely , " he said . " You 'll have a pretty day tomorrow . " <p> Tate looked up . Wind from the south would bring good weather , though hotter . He stared in the same direction as Rich Peters , seeing the light company 's yellow truck on the road . " I wondered how you ... " <p> " I checked the meter at the store and walked here . " Tate thought back to the time he 'd walk in this heat when he did n't have to . <p> A car stopped at the Center unloading what seemed to be a bunch of girls , women anyhow . They rushed around measuring the handicap ramp 's railings . No telling what they were up to about that party . Several of them hung flower baskets from hooks on the porch 's ceiling . Tate wanted to cry , Watch out There were wasps in the eaves . He wanted to feel needed and necessary and even that he was a savior . <p> Rich said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be four stores here when I started , and now there 's one . " <p> " Shoot , " Tate told him . " When I was a boy there were seven stores . A hotel . Business college . Boardinghouse . " <p> " You 're kidding . " Rich whistled . Tate went on telling all the things that used to be on the road through town , and liked how the boy 's eyes widened . There was a blacksmith 's shop , and an old store where somebody  --  one of his brothers actually  --  used to show picture shows on Saturday nights . " A nickel to get in . Tom Mix shoot-'em-ups . " Tate cocked an ever-ready trigger finger . There used to be a town pump in a gazebo where folks swapped gossip and watered horses . A cotton gin . Feed store . Awe deepened on the young man 's face about the passage of time , the way Tate wanted . <p> He went on in a smooth voice once compared to Bing Crosby 's , mellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tate sang in public , he had a crooning , lovelorn quality he could not help . He was singing for the love . of Jesus , townfolks liked to comment . No one died but that Tate was asked to sing at the funeral . Baptist or Methodist  --  for once denomination was forgotten . Now , though , his voice had lost its timbre and fiber . It had a lonesome sound like the far-off reed of a piper . He could no longer keep on key and had given up singing aloud even in the shower , where he used to try to tempt Allie to wash alongside him . " Go on , boy , " she would say , blushing . She never could get over her strict , Baptist , country-girl 's upbringing . Or could she ? Tate wondered . <p> " I have n't been in that store since Loma Murphy died , " he said , looking over his knees at the one remaining store . " And those new folks bought it . Everybody shops now in supermarkets , like Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Those new folks are liable to get nickeled and dimed to death . " What , he thought , would happen to the main road through town with everything emptying out ? <p> Loma Murphy , Tate said , would do a turnaround in her grave , if she had n't already , about what had been done to her store . She 'd kept it the way it was built in the 1860s and with its own sense of worth and dignity . Now these new folks had it covered up with siding . Allie mourned from the front window the day that happened , " This whole countryside 's going to be nothing but aluminum . " They also mourned the old churches , their two in town , covered over . Every day they had to fight salesmen coming to their door wanting to cover their house the same way . <p> Tate had heard that in Loma 's store there were glass-fronted refrigerated cases big enough to stand in , lit by neon . At night they shone out to the road like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only one small case , the meat growing ever more rancid as folks started driving elsewhere to shop . She had a single butcher block to cut up cheese and chickens . You always did get , Tate said , a feather along with your Velveeta . <p> But he would n't tell stories any longer . Pretty soon Rich would get that slack-jawed look young people got when you went on too long about the past . Someday Rich Peters might mention not being able to go to the moon for a day 's shopping or say once the government ran the whole business , and he 'd get back those same looks . Rich said , " I guess you 've seen a lot of changes , " his flashlight hanging from one hand . <p> He looked so sweet , so innocent , so young , Tate wanted to hug him to his breast , be his mother and father both . He had no children . Only lately had he begun to feel that lack . Why the situation existed neither he nor Allie nor any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It is God 's will . But what had God 's will meant ? <p> Tate told Rich about Loma Murphy 's writing her name in script in wet cement on her store porch , with a finely whittled willow stick a colored boy fixed her . She wrote so carefully , her tongue between her teeth , that in recounting , Tate sensed her saying the letters slowly , one by one , L and O ... The old men playing checkers on her porch got off their kegs to watch . Loma never married and had no children , and that was what she left , he supposed , her name in concrete . <p> Feet crossed that name daily , few of their owners knowing now who Loma was or why her name was there . She seemed not even to be past history . Tate thought he could not tell this boy the truth . He could never say , Look at me . See the future . Did n't the boy see it already He would n't tell the boy about hidden things , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . <p> Tate said , " I 've lived here all my life except for my lime in the war . " <p> " What war would that be ? " Rich asked . <p> Tate looked at his watch crystal as if to provide himself an answer . " The Second World War , son , " he answered . <p> Rich was obviously embarrassed . " Of course , " he said . Mr. Tate was not so old he could have been in any war before that . Rich repeated , " Lived here all your life . Not many folks can say that any longer . About growing where you are planted . " He looked away at the grass recently cut , at the sky and the trees and the main road . The wonder that dawned this time was not what Tate intended . <p> He pointed past Dr. Crowley 's old home , saying , " Down that road 's where I came from , " and looked back at the house , which had been Allie 's widowed Daddy 's . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle with no say-so of your own . He had a foreboding that years hence he 'd be wandering this place , a ghostly ghost , without anybody 's knowing he 'd been here in the first place . The same house would be on the same hill , with the pasture and the pond , while the hydrangea bushes would have sprung back and flowered . <p> Rich Peters made his way off , wishing Tate good luck on the party tomorrow . Halfway down the slope he turned back , saying , " Can I help with that tire ? " <p> Tate waved him on . Good-bye ; good luck , he meant . He thought he could do it . Otherwise he would have to go after Preacher Allan to help . Preacher was an old black man who 'd retired about the time Tate had . They 'd been friends since the beginning , when they rode bareback on horses , using rope for a bridle . Now they rode in Tate 's truck , covering the same territory . Tate grabbed the tractor to hoist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty McCall , sleeping on the truck 's cab , awoke . Her eyes might have been shut , she may have been asleep , but she knew the movement of every mouse in the pasture . In yellow evenings , when willows met in the pond , she battled minnows at the water 's edge with one paw . Many nights from his doorway , Tate stood calling , " Here , Puss , " and she never came inside . She was the cat who walked by herself . As much as he envied her freedom , Tate envied her courage more . Kitty McCall was neutered , and no protectorate waited for her in the night . She went off to meet nobody , and nobody looked for her . She strayed into the dark , alone , heeding what called her . <p> He set to work with the tire iron after a hard trek to get it . Bolts of color shot through his eyes . Then he saw everything as he thought Rich Peters must have seen it . He prodded and pried a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as he tried to lift the flat , the jack flew back and hit him in the head . <p> Tate was stunned . A biblical phrase formed in his mind : Why hast thou forsaken me ? A melancholy overtook him . The next minute he would have returned the truck a swift kick . But a curtain of blood streamed before his eyes . He saw his shirt : was covered with it . He was afraid to touch his forehead , knowing the cut to be wide One half-inch lower and the jack would have gouged out his eye . He groped his way to the house . <p> Allie , inside , must have heard fumbling at the door . " Tate " she screamed . She took him to a bathroom where he leaned close , taking in her warmth and scent of toilet water , soap ; he smelled antiseptic , felt her soft fingers , and remembered his mother , Vicks salve , sassafras tea , mustard plasters , and old Stella . <p> Allie , applying a wing-shaped Band-Aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry him to the doctor in Whitehill or the emergency room at Nashtoba . He might need stitches . He would only have a little headache , Tate said , smiling weakly , and he took his second aspirin of the day ( he took one every morning for his heart ) . At noon he ate some pot roast and potatoes in the kitchen and then went to lie on a sofa in the room where Allie sat for his near-about-all-day nap . <p> Tate got up to eat supper before going back to sleep . Allie , as she often did , said , " How can you sleep so much ? " At nine Tate liked to get up from his after-supper nap to go to bed . Allie always stayed up for the ten o'clock news . " How can you sleep so much " she said . " Can you hand me the little box please for changing channels ? " <p> Here came the windup Here came the pitch Just like in the good old days of baseball . The black box sailed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartly , an old tomboy herself . " Why , boy , " she said . " What on earth ? " <p> Tate turned with a slight grin , not really knowing what he had expected . Allie told people he slept through the night and she stayed awake . But plenty nights he heard her snoring , and the creaking of trees , noise that might be Miss Puss wanting in or was merely the sound that came with ruminations of the past . <p> Tonight Allie bustled around in her kitchen later than usual doing something for that party , and happy , happy as a lark . <p> The next day , having studied his Sunday school lesson , Tate was going off to church . Allie had not started back since her operation . Holding his book , he lingered in the door . Maybe she needed him to come home after Sunday school " Do what you want to do , " Allie told him . She was busy with her box of fish scales . She had not started back either to the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high . This morning Mabel was coming to do Allie 's hair at home . " Do n't tell anybody , " she said . " I only do this on special occasions "  --  like for a death , she meant . " But this is special . " <p> Turning from the door , Tate went up as close as possible to Allie , clinging to his Sunday school book , and asked , " Are you going to change my Band-Aid " Allie put her box down slowly . She shoved aside a cup of decaf ; old folks had to give up caffeine too . She stood up with a full light of understanding in her eyes . She was a mother at last . Fifty years late , she might have been saying to herself . They stood together at the medicine chest mirror , eyes never meeting . <p> Tate drove away thinking she was the one crippled-up , but he got the shocked looks : the **52;431;TOOLONG looks . So old ; like a cadaver . Just like his Momma in her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called on to interpret the lesson . He did not want to talk in church any longer . " I 've talked here enough , " Tate said . " Let the young people do it . " They rule the earth , he thought . Asked to pass the collection plate , he did not want to walk up and down the aisles any longer either . When he walked up and down , people seemed to want him to say something , but he did not know what they wanted to hear . <p> Allie kept at him about his missing bottom teeth . " You look like this , " she said , sticking out her lip , wagging her chin up and down . " Like you 're chewing a cud . " He looked like those old men at Loma 's store , she said , who used to spit tobacco toward the road and hit their galluses . <p> When he came home , the house smelled like a beauty parlor , of Clorox or chloroform . There had never been a time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : because it was Allie 's . It would be hers long after her death . The old man left things so bollixed up that nobody would ever get clear title . He 'd added codicil after codicil trying to make things come out right in the hereafter . If Allie died and Tate remarried , no wife of his or her prior issue could inherit house or land . No issue he might have with another woman could inherit anything . All he knew was , the old man could have saved himself a lot of time , effort , and money into a lawyer 's pocket . Remarry ? Whoo , boy , he thought . <p> He did not have time to put away his Bible before Allie started in on him . " Tate , " she said as he came in , " when did you put this in the dryer ? I thought I had my good things hidden . " She held up something about the size Kitty McCall might wear . With a sob Allie said it was her camisole . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to wear . " Clearly , Tate did n't know what she was talking about , and she quit explaining . Allie rummaged through drawers , saying she did not have anything else to put on . Pretty soon , nieces swarmed in going cluck-cluck . They passed Tate , who was trying to eat chicken pot pie for noon dinner and acting , manlike , as if he did not know what the ruckus was about . They carried on in the bedroom like a bunch of kids till he reminded himself those nieces were middle-aged , with lined faces . With Mabel gone , they styled and restyled Allie 's hair . " We do n't want it set-looking , " one of them said . " Mabel 's still into too many little curls . " <p> " I do n't want it teased , " Allie said . <p> " No . We want it just like this  --  whuff " <p> Allie came out looking like a new person . Tate said , " You look pretty . " <p> They all came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bridal attendant , straightening her hem . Another ran behind , fastening her necklace . Tate muttered , " I see you found something else to wear " ; but he said that into his plate , and no one heard . It was a joke nobody would think was funny . Everybody still wore grim reminders around their eyes about the dryer incident . <p> A niece said , " Here 's Merle Norman 's newest shade , Aunt Allie . Purple Passion . Try that on . " They all gathered around , giggling , at a mirror while Allie applied the lipstick . Following the nieces out , Allie said , " I may burn up in this suit even if it's. cotton . But old ladies have got to cover their arms . " Tate wanted to take a nap . The others finally departed , unsettling his gravel and kicking up dust . <p> " What happened to your hydrangeas ? " one of the nieces asked . <p> " Oh , you know . " Allie gave a throaty laugh and an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical , he thought , lying down . What 's done is done . No sense crying over spilt milk . He fell asleep . <p> Allie told him later , " It 's time , Tate . " He rose quickly , defensively , as if to meet a challenge , a. dare , some fellow who wanted to fight , and wondered what he had been dreaming about . Having showered and shaved that morning , he had only to put back on his suit . He 'd left it stretched across the bed with its arms out to keep from wrinkling . Now it was gone  --  put away , he suspected , by one of the nieces . He had to search for it . <p> Allie did not mention walking to the Center , though it was only a few feet , and downhill . She would not let him drive her Chevrolet , and he did not want to . Its seatbelt ran back of its own accord and held him by the throat as if to choke him . The dashboard lit up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , told you , Put on your seatbelt . Do n't stand too close . Good Lord , Tate thought . He was still longing for the days of Dr. Crowley 's old Ford with its horn going Ah-ooga , Ah-ooga . <p> Tate wondered when the doctor would stop his driving . That happening was as inevitable as death and taxes . There were few places to pass in the hills , and maybe he was a menace , driving slowly because of his poor reflexes . A line of cars congregated in his rearview mirror . Drivers were probably gritting their teeth . At the worst possible moments , they flew around him on curves as if they could not stand crawling another minute . He feared causing an accident . <p> Allie parked at the side of the building , leaving space in front for guests . In its shed , the fire truck seemed to grin in self-importance . The door was always left open in case of a hasty departure . Good day , Tate bade it in silence . <p> Allie went ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wrapped with gold crepe paper . He guessed yellow balloons were the closest thing to golden . They were filled with helium , tied on ; they rose up like a bunch of bald-headed fellows . It was going to be hot inside that place too , he 'd betcha . The ramp was easier than managing steps , Allie said . Just then one of those faceless , yellow , bald-headed fellows popped in the heat all by itself . " He'p my soul , " Allie cried . " I thought I was shot . " <p> " I hope everybody does n't crowd in on time , " Tate warned . " It 's going to be hot inside . " <p> " There is n't any set time , Tate , " Allie said . " It 's open house from four to six . " <p> " There you got it , fellow . " A countryman slapped Tate on the back , giving him a broad wink . " You and me ought to be out of here fishing , " the man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally went into <p> room with window air-conditioners and ceiling fans trying to distribute air . Baskets of bronze and yellow flowers were everywhere . People were already sneezing , and he 'd be next ; everything might be gold in honor , but goldenrod had been mixed in by mistake . Children had picked it by the roadsides , and his heart went out to all who helped . Mabel sat at a table with an autograph book . Tate bent down until Allie spoke . " You do n't have to sign your name , Tate . We know you 're here . " <p> " Have mercy , " she said to others , with a joshing look to gloss over another of his mistakes . Mabel laughed along behind her hand . Another man slapped him on the back . " This party 's for womenfolks , Tate . What do you think " the townsman asked , going past . <p> Tate took a golden gumdrop from a dish , though without his bottom teeth , he could never chew it . The thought of crusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see yourself in a mirror ? " Allie would ask . " See how you look ? Just you wait . Some Friday evening when we 're eating at Roy Rogers ' in Nashtoba , I 'm not going to wear my bottom teeth . See if you 're not embarrassed . " But as often as she threatened , Allie never left home without her chompers . Tate thought about the day he had his teeth fitted . The dentist kept him in the chair so long that his ankles swelled and his toes went to sleep . The chair gripped his head so long , he heard music from outer space . The man 's knuckles had kept pressing the roof of his mouth toward his skull , and he could not cry out . The dentist 's hands were slicked up in rubber gloves as if he knew to be careful of this particular patient  --  Tate McCall  --  who was one big known germ carrier . He got up finally , saying , " They fit , " and walked out . He hid the bottom teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . <p> There 's been enough waiting in life , Tate thought . Now , with the pen in his hand , and the autograph book unsigned , he wondered , What have I been waiting for ? The answer came back to him purely and simply , For death . <p> Next to the autograph book was a picture in a gold frame of a handsome young couple . It seemed to have been taken in the present because the girl 's skirt was up to her knees . She was tall and thin and bent at the waist toward the young man . His army cap was pushed back at a rakish angle , and he grinned underneath brazenly , straight at the camera . That 's us , Tate thought , with a jolt . He could hardly believe it . " Is n't it a shame what happens to people , " Allie muttered . To others she said loudly , " That was taken right after the ceremony . On a day as hot as this . " <p> " I ' member it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like he could eat you up with a spoon . " <p> " I remember his rushing her off after that license , " a man said . " Afraid she 'd get away from him . " <p> " He would n't give her one minute , " a woman laughed . <p> " I had a rip in the underarm of my dress . And Tate would n't let me stop to change , " Allie said . <p> " Allie wore her corsage to a ball game , " Tate said . " The next evening . " Nobody heard . Nobody ever listened to a bridegroom , he guessed . Once you were a bride it seemed you always were one . Making his way through a bevy of people , he tried to put together names with faces . There seemed to be so many old folks in the room , and he wondered , Do I look as old as them ? Some of the women had a blue tint to their hair , and some had a rose hue he thought must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only people he 'd known all his life who were still left living . People standing around patted themselves on the back about that . It seemed to be the accomplishment of their lives , that they were living . <p> Tate was the last of seven brothers and sisters . How 'd he feel about outlasting everybody ? somebody asked . He did not answer . How did they think he felt ? What is wrong with people that they could ask a question so stupid ? Could n't they imagine for themselves , feel it even , ' what it was like in these blue-shaded hills once peopled with his people , to have them all gone ? <p> They moved ahead of him everywhere . A brother , Ralph , hailed him in the distance with a brace of quail , all of them covertly clad , hidden in brown . The youngest sister , Flossie , who was home only a short time while he was , had learned to drive Poppa 's car and scooted ahead of him in it , still . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was nearly fifty when he was born . The last thing on earth she must have wanted was another baby . <p> Maybe that was why she took to her bed . Maybe that was why Poppa ate himself so corpulent he could hardly ride a horse . Yet was n't he a comfort to his mother once she was widowed ? He went back to that September morning when he was in his knickers and Poppa suddenly put down his chin toward a big belly , leaving forever alone in a kitchen a startled boy and an old woman . <p> At the time Poppa was chewing his favorite food , gristle . We did n't know not to eat fat or red meat , Tate said to himself . He passed up that minute a bowl of salted nuts and some butter-rich cookies the ladies had busted their bustles making golden . Taking care of himself the way he ' was , he could live to be as old as Methuselah  --  older ; who needed that <p> Everywhere were bowls of white-chocolate mints , smaller than quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut . One goober could n't hurt anybody . Gumming it , he thought about the monkeyshines his parents had been up to at near his age . He thought how all that left him so much earlier . A doctor had agreed when asked that the medicines Mr. McCall was taking for his surgeries , his heart condition , for high blood pressure could lead to  --  and what had the fellow said ? A loss of libido . Tate smiled in the present as he had smiled in the past , wondering why the man could n't have put it so much more simply . If he told the gospel truth , he had not missed that activity so much . He did not believe Allie had either . Maybe he never had been a sexy person . There was nobody to ask ; his wife had no basis for comparison . <p> He stopped . Allie said , " Here 's the punch table . Does n't it look pretty ? " <p> Ruthie poured more ginger ale over a mound of lemon sherbet , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Maybe you should have used orange sherbet , hon. " <p> " Oh , Aunt Allie . Of course I should have . You 're right . " <p> Tate , after downing a cup of the stuff , did n't believe color would make any difference . It was not as cold as you wanted something in this weather either . He wanted to loosen his tie but was afraid of ruffling Allie 's feathers . When another balloon popped outside , she grabbed herself , crying , " My soul " <p> Gold streamers blew away from window units and tickled his face . He and Allie were too crowded , sitting as they were told to at one end of the room , like royalty . People kept coming up and offering congratulations . Some brought presents , though The Democrat 's write-up clearly said not to . What on earth could be in all those boxes for two old folks who needed nothing ? Allie sighed beside him . <p> His underdrawers grew damp . Her face powder streaked and slid down her cheeks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth , pan of his interest in the activity went away because he got tired of climbing on an aging woman , who eventually was heftier than he was . <p> People , coming up , talked about the exploits of his brothers and sisters . " I remember Herbert , " a man said , " nearly burning down this community smoking behind the feed store when he was n't but seven . " <p> " Four stores went , " another person added . <p> " I recall James catching that ERROR? catfish in Grey Wolf River , " a man told . <p> " I remember your sister Katie eloping . My land That was so romantic . Just like in storybooks . " Miss Maude Russell clasped hands to her breasts . <p> None of them would have mentioned that Poppa McCall had been standing by with a shotgun if that elopement had n't taken place . The upshot of it stood right across the room , the premature baby who had weighed eight pounds . She was shooing some grandkids now . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing ' The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise ' at Miss Betty Crowley 's funeral . You set this community on its ear . " <p> " How come that ? " a younger person asked . <p> " It was n't church music , " was the reply . <p> Half-grinning , Tate did n't mention that had been Miss Betty 's request . He could see himself on that altar singing , " ... sunrise " while watching Dr. Crowley eye the woman who would be his next wife . He recalled again running through that September heat , the whoosh of knickers , the smell of carnations that would remind him of death even years later , and appearing in the man 's kitchen shouting , " It 's Poppa " with that rattletrap trip home afterward . So that eyeing the man eyeing the woman at that funeral he had o forgive the doctor , because was n't that what life was all about , some kind of trade-off ? It seemed he had figured that out even as a younger man . <p> He no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wait-ting The words rose up in his throat unheralded and hung there , cracking . That was my finest , my shining hour , he thought , singing a song at a funeral that nobody had ever heard sung at one before . And it was n't even my idea . <p> Church music today could be a drumbeat , a xylophone , a horn tooting , a guitar , whatever the preacher , being young himself , brought in to woo young folks . Having his preacher running through town in jogging shorts went against Tate 's grain ; seeing the man 's pale , thin legs bared like lily stalks gave him the sensation of seeing something he ought not , like the preacher 's wife undressing , or the preacher peeing . <p> Brother Lott brought in youth groups to sing loud songs that were nothing but the same line repeated over ... and over ... and over . The man had people he called folksingers there on the altar singing way up in their noses and plucking and strumming chords on a guitar without ever really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , and nothing they could do about it . Tate liked old-timey ways better , with the preacher shouting you were going to hell in a bucket if you did n't believe the Bible and making a sermon out of that . Brother Lott read poetry to them out of books , as if he could n't think up anything of his own . <p> Tate finally had to escape the chair and the people , and unloosening his tie a bit , he wandered off . He passed young men talking about the need for a new fire truck . Not one of them thought about asking his advice or pulling him into the conversation . He wanted to say , I was one of the first volunteers <p> They were talking about holding concerts here in the Community Center to raise money . Elvis impersonators ; hard rock ; heavy metal . Tate was n't sure he knew what they were talking about . How about a cakewalk ? he wanted to venture . That 's how we raised money in the first place . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dizzying , crazy pattern that was a cakewalk 's . One of the young men grabbed his elbow , steadying , and said , " You all right , Mr. Tate ? " <p> He told him , " Yes sir , " and the boy let loose . " Mighty fine party , " he told Tate , lying through his teeth , standing there drinking the sweet stuff , eating a teeny sandwich . He guessed the boy did n't know any other conversation to make . <p> " ... fifty years later , " the boy concluded , and Tate tried to fill in what he had n't heard . Balloons outside were still popping . The young fellows stared at him as if he was something the cat dragged in . Imagine , they must be thinking , being married longer than other folks had been living . <p> " You 're mighty nice to come , " he told them , out of common courtesy . Behind his back , thinking Tate was out of earshot , one of the young men snickered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-skiing . Why , forget it . " The rest of them laughed like a pack of jackals . <p> Tate kept on his same direction , a little dizzily . It overcame him sometimes in the bank or post office , and folks had to help him sit down while he took a nitroglycerin tablet . The doctor told Allie , " He ca n't go on being a menace to himself and others on the road . " They were talking about country roads ; he 'd long since given up driving on highways . <p> " Tate . Had anything to eat " Maude Russell propelled him along in her wake . " The food 's so pretty . " The food table was at the opposite end of the room , and near it he saw Allie stand up . Something was afoot . Something he was going to have to take part in . In the kitchen , partly partitioned by a curtain , the cateress and her helper were busy . Tate saw them pull slices of white bread out of a polka-dot wrapper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later , the cateress brushed the crusts into a garbage sack . Whoa there ; wait a minute , he wanted to shout . How many bread puddings had he eaten from just such scraps back yonder when nobody wasted anything , in the Depression ? Leftovers from leftovers went to hogs , and he 'd carried out many a slop bucket . His eye caught that of the cateress , there in the kitchen with her shiny-armed helper . He 'd eyed Esther Jones as long as he could remember , since the beginning , and he stood there singing silently words in his throat . He thought back to the first Sunday school class of all , the Cradle Roll , and eyeing Esther then , who must have known it too , because he had been a good-looking boy . Years later when he met her in the halls of whatever school , she 'd given him special treatment , a lipsticky grin , a toothpasty smile , wiggling her hips . He stood now thinking about lost opportunities . <p> Try as he might , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allie in his mind 's eye . Their families must have always shoved them together , and there was not a time he could think of , even back to Cradle Roll , when he had n't known he was going to marry Allie Gates . <p> If he 'd been different , Tate thought , something might have happened with Esther instead of the nothing that took place . Eyes twinkling , he chose to look at her again  --  across that long space of years  --  but also across the distance from where he stood to the kitchen . Esther came out , wiping her face , and rounded the table . Uh oh , Tate told himself . Here came a big , three-tiered wedding cake being wheeled out , its icing thick and white . This was what all the ushering was about , the wake of the ladies and Allie crossing the room . " The photographer from The Democrat 's finally here , " someone shouted . <p> Esther asked , " You got something in your eye , Tate ? " She had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a twinkle in his eye suddenly had a cast . Tate shook his head . You do n't remember he wanted to ask . He needed to get out of the place . Show the seat of , the dust of , his pants . <p> " I saw you looking like you had something in your eye , " Esther said , straightening a tray of round sandwiches : white cut-outs sprinkled with paprika . <p> " Now who invited him ? " Allie said . <p> To Tate 's joy , Preacher Allan walked in . " We did , Aunt Allie , " Ruthie said . " He 's Uncle Tate 's best friend . " <p> " I know he is . I do n't mind . I was just surprised , " Allie said . <p> Hat in hand , Preacher moved toward the honored guests . Most of the people knew him , yet he could not help but duck his gray head , shy about being the only colored person present . " I 'm glad you came , " Tate said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , and Tate could not warn him in front of others . " I see you got trouble with your tractor , " Preacher said . <p> Tate hung his head . He could n't ell Preacher about the promise to himself . He said , " I did n't get finished cutting my grass . " <p> " I 'll come over tomorrow and he'p you , " Preacher said . <p> " I do n't know if I 'm going to be here tomorrow or not , Preacher , " Tate said . " I 'll let you know if I am . " <p> " Cake , " people started crying , and they swarmed forward . The hefty young photographer apologized for being late . " We can start the cutting ceremony , " a guest said . Tate froze . Had he heard right He prayed not , but knew he was lost . Step up , fellow , he told himself . This many years later he would have to feel like a fool again . He would have to repeat what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same silver cake knife gussied up with a bow ribbon . His and Allie 's hands went atop one another . They would cut a slice , feed each other , nibble it up . The photographer would click , and tomorrow they 'd show up in the paper with mouths full of cake . More cake than teeth , Tate thought . If the fool woman told him to smile for the birdie , he would leave . <p> " Smile for the birdie , " the photographer said . <p> " Tate . What on this earth You missed my mouth . " <p> Young men guffawed . Tate 's fingers were dabbled with icing , but Allie had it smeared by one ear . Grin for the camera , he remembered . Grin grin grin . <p> " Smile for the birdie , " the photographer said again . Tate was being force-fed like a goose , gall and cake stuck in his gullet . Or maybe it was his heart . <p> Preacher delicately ate the second slice of cake that was cut , off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nieces took over the cutting . Tate was free to wander after Preacher Allan when he left . He thanked the man a second time for coming ; he would n't have wanted to be the only white man in a room full of colored . It was only recently the colors started inviting each other to events . Though white people had always gone where they wanted . How many colored churches had he sat : outside of , listening to the singing , thinking when black people came out to pass the hat that they were just glad of the money ? Maybe they had all along been full of resentment and hate that they could n't say , Get out of my churchyard , white folks . How many colored friends had he gone to see buried , too , and been ushered to the front pew , an honored guest , sitting there with his neck prickling and glad to think , I 'm white . <p> Preacher Allan would see him put six feet under , Tate felt . On the road the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on , " people called out . " The flowers are here . " They were late arriving because the photographer kindly brought them from the Nashtoba florist . Clucking ladies dabbed icing from Allie 's hair with paper napkins . Tate approached , and she told him , " Tate . I swear . " <p> He and she stood together opening two waxy white boxes . Inside , in a lot of paper , they found flowers . Tate could not pin on Allie 's so someone else stuck on her yellow orchid with tigerish brown spots . Tate stood still as a statue , eyes wandering , while Allie pinned to his lapel a perfect , pink-white rosebud reminding him of a baby 's death . <p> Allie was tired and had to sit down . He bent over her . " Orchids do n't smell , Tate , " she said . <p> He drew back , taking his kiss with him , and told her , " You could wear that corsage to a ball game . " <p> " Why , boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had had enough sense of humor to suit him , Tate thought . <p> She sat in an honorary chair , a yellow balloon tied to it denoting that . When he bent toward her , Tate spied an extra pin in her flower box , and since nobody seemed to be looking , he popped the balloon behind her . <p> Allie rose out of her chair , screaming . He saw then there could be consequences . She could break her old hip , she could break the new one . Allie grabbed hold of the heirloom lace tablecloth , borrowed for the day , that was covering the punch table . Ruthie , ladling punch , slopped it all over . Cups already filled spilled down the cloth to the floor , creating a lovely , yellow , puddling mess  --  little boys ran there like quicksilver to skate , slip , and slide in it . Parents ran after them to haul them back by their coattails , blaming each other that their children behaved so badly . Spats started . Little girls ran shrieking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . <p> People started wiping at the floor with napkins , paper towels , and smelly dishrags from the kitchen . Esther and the helper ran in and out taking away dirty cups , bringing clean ones . The tablecloth 's owner shook her head , frowning , saying , " It does n't matter . " <p> " Do n't let anything else happen , " Allie said . " Look at me . I 'm ruint . " <p> The front of her suit was covered with lemony , gummy drops . Tate stole off . A little girl 's hand found its way into his . " Can I pop one ? " she whispered . <p> They headed for the food table . On the way they stopped by a side table where a lot of the faceless , yellow , bald-headed fellows rose out of the flowers . Kneeling on a chair , the child could reach them . <p> Men were startled . The popping sounded like backfire on the road , or like gunshots , and hunting season had n't even started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the commotion , the fugitives went about freely , popping balloons . Everybody thought heat caused the problem ; the air-conditioners were n't adequate for the crowd . Now the heat was worse because people were leaving , and the door opening . <p> The sodden tablecloth had to be taken off . An ugly , plain , raw pine board lay underneath , over sawhorses that were just as bad , as basic and pitiful as any pauper 's casket . " Watch out for splinters , " a man said ; but nobody was having any more punch : Thank you . <p> There was nothing to do but mop . Esther and her helper brought in a sudsy bucket of water and dipped and wrung till the place stank of disinfectant . Afterwards there were wide , wet places on the floor that old folks had to be skittish about . They held onto one another and headed for the door . Now Allie 's eyes looked like wild violets with dew on them . <p> " Try you one of these sandwiches , " the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He picked up a round hole of bread , watching as her braces turned red with paprika . She put what was left of her sandwich on the tray , a quarter-moon slice of bread with crimped edges from having been bitten . Tate bit into one in the same way , prepared to tell her it was only cucumber . But that was not the case . Beneath was something strange , strong , and fishy . He put his own quarter-moon back where he got it , on the ornate silver tray borrowed for the occasion . <p> The little girl 's mother came over . " What were you talking to Mr. Tate about ? " she asked . <p> " I asked why he did this , " said the child , waggling her chin up and down in perfect imitation of a cow chewing or of Allie mocking him . Tate knew he never was going to remember where he hid those teeth from himself . <p> " I do n't believe it 's ruint , " Allie said , looking at the tablecloth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the other end of the room , a man hollered , " A mouse has been nibbling the food . " <p> " Only nibbling ? " a man chortled . " Maybe that mouse do n't like anchovy paste either . " <p> Esther and the helper ran from the kitchen . Esther in horror stood crying , " There 's no more bread . " What did that matter , somebody asked . Nobody wanted more food . A small crowd of people shoved to the door . Ladies told Allie , " This party has been just lovely , " as if not a thing in the world had occurred out of the ordinary . <p> Tate slipped out . On the road he stood impressed by the number of people who had come . He wondered who they all were and where they were going , feeling everybody but himself was busy . Nobody would miss this half of the honored guests leaving , he thought . <p> The tractor on its hillside loomed down at him . He went around to the shed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the truck stayed hidden . He rummaged behind hanging yellow slickers and orderly rows of boots . He set a fireman 's hat on his head and groaned trying to swing up to the running board , first with one stiff leg and then with the other . Finally he dragged a stool over and made his way up . After a time he pulled himself onto the seat , knees first , his hands splayed like a child 's learning to crawl . He sat up , squinting , and fumblingly inserted the key . Look out he warned everyone in silence . The engine rumbled under him . With stiff fingers , his knuckles aching , he managed to start the siren . The fire truck rushed out into the clear , shining path always left open for it . <p> Cars pulled hurriedly to the side of the road . Customers ran out of Loma 's old store at the truck 's blaring . Partygoers stood stunned on the road . They called back to people inside , " It 's Tate ... Tate McCall running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of them . The wind whipped in his direction . His hat tilted , and he righted it . He drove with the freedom of one hand . He turned down the sharp , steep road that led to the government dam . Nothing was beyond the road 's end but the roaring , rushing water that was the dam 's spillway , and a favorite spot for fishing . Beyond was the calm , opaque , muddy Mississippi water that was Itna Homa Lake . Only in the sun 's right glance did it ever shine . <p> Tate had thoughtfully provided for himself . His pockets were crammed with mints emblazoned 50 . He fingered them securely while the siren roared . People ran out of houses all along the way , sheltering their faces to the sun and staring . People tending gardens stood up out of them , like stalks . Kids on bikes rode faster , waving to the old man in the truck . If they missed the mints Tate threw , they got off their bikes to find them . There were black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing what Sunday afternoon called for , napping under trees , cutting grass , visiting with the preacher . <p> Tate swept past , throwing mints . People ran out , gathering them up . He passed . a small general store that stayed alive mostly by selling crickets for fishing . The crickets were out in the sun , chirping in bait boxes . The store 's owner was an old woman he knew , Miss Annie . She came out to her one flat step , eyeglasses glinting . Tate tossed mints , which she caught in her apron , billowed out like a cloud . One time in her store she gave him a hunk of rat-trap cheese for tasting , so much he carried most of it home to Allie . All for nothing , for free He tossed Miss Annie more mints going by . <p> As a kid he had gone to the Christmas parade in Memphis . People rode by on floats in tulle and velvet britches , society folks , he reckoned , tossing down candy . To common folks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on curbs . <p> Along the way people shouted at him , but Tate could not hear anything they said . Maybe they were trying to tell him the road ahead was dead end , as if he did n't know that , having lived here all his life . Soon there would be nothing but a ramp where people put in boats for fishing or sailing , and a large sign reading " Government Property . " <p> It was much easier than Tate expected . He drove straight down past the sign and into the water . When his head went under , he heard the siren drown out , sputter , pop , like a spark plug 's going , electricity shorting , or a firecracker 's sizzling to its end . ... <p> He came up and found himself standing on the truck 's seat . This is not what I intended , Lord , he told himself . Even now , Tate could not shout . His lips seemed sealed , pasted together by the muddy water he could taste . The truck had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long way before the water grew deep . People were coming toward him  --  he began counting cars  --  one , two , and three . ... Kids on bicycles pedaled faster toward him , shouting . No matter that he could have drowned , they cried , " Hooray " Imagine the stories they 'd have to tell in school on Monday . <p> Now people would watch him like a hawk . They would expect behavior that was wilder , stranger , crazier ; he was certainly nutty as <p> fruitcake . They would jerk their kids out of his sight , his path , and his reach . It 's worse , Tate thought . It 's worse than it ever has been in this world . <p> He would be nothing but a doddering old fool , the town character , the town jerk  --  a loony . Maybe he ought to be put away in the asylum at Whitfield . Sweet , mild-mannered , passive Mr. Tate  --  what could have happened ? It showed anybody at all could go off his rocker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inside him . It was often , you know , the sweetest , quietest ones you had to watch . They would warn Allie not to go to sleep beside him at night . He might turn murderous next . <p> Kids , having pedaled up , shied away when they reached the water . They only stood back and stared . Miss Annie at the store kept blinking , still holding up her apron , not knowing what she expected , but expecting something . Black people with fishing poles lashed to their cars like hoops rode toward him . Strange white boys looked at him from a battered car , laughing and smoking cigarettes . " Man , " one of them said enviously , blowing acrid , scented smoke , " what a trip . " <p> A flock of folks came running , walking , pedaling , driving toward him . And there 's nothing I can do about it , Tate told himself . He could not even drown in his sorrow . He continued standing , his feet half-submerged , waiting and watching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center . She got out , tapping her cane toward the cobblestone ramp , helped along by nieces and nephews . Some of the nephews ran alongside , young fellows hollering about their fire truck and the damage to it . Would insurance cover this ? Hey , fellow . It 's your fault You 're guilty . <p> Suppose that sometime , tonight , tomorrow , next week , the entire community burned down , acres of it , waiting for a fire truck to come from the station in Whitehill , ten miles away The nieces and nephews held Allie by the shoulders to steady her walk . Tapping on , she reached the water 's edge to cry at last , " Tate . What on this earth ? " <p> Her eyes too held that look of wonder , fear , distrust about a man without enough oxygen to his brain , which was not his case and never had been . <p> Allie stood . with her feet at the water 's edge while gentle waves lapped back and forth , propelled by distant boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tapped her cane one more time , asking again with all that support behind her , " Tate . What on this earth ? " <p> He stared back in silence , saying , Happy anniversary . <p>
