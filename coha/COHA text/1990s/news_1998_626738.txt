<p> There are far too many of them to accord their fair share of notice . <p> After 73 consecutive Texas state high school championships , 72 Texas Relays , 16 Southwest Conference meets and four NCAA championships within the walls of Memorial Stadium in Austin , this weekend 's state meet will be the last track and field event inside the edifice that hosted its first meet in 1925 . <p> The athletes coming after those who wrote and then rewrote the record books will perform next year in a new setting . <p> How soon it will take those future classes to fashion what one current coach and former state meet participant calls " a great happening " is open to speculation . Based on the heights reached by their predecessors , the best guess is not long . <p> World , American , collegiate and national high school records have been etched into the various tracks and field-event pits in Memorial Stadium , now officially named Darrell K Royal-Memorial Stadium . <p> Starting next spring , the 20,000-seat Mike A. Myers Stadium will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state meet , Texas Relays and University of Texas women 's soccer . After the Longhorns ' final football game of the 1998 season ( Nov. 27 against Texas A &M),; the current track will be removed to allow for the lowering of the field and the addition of seats . <p> Thus , at about 10 p.m . Saturday , when the concluding event of the 87th annual state high school meet is finished , there will be a sense of elation mixed with the sadness . Elation for the great feats witnessed from thousands of the athletes who have run , jumped and thrown at the storied venue . And regret and sadness because future memories must be stored and weighed amid new surroundings . <p> Yet , as sure as Bobby Morrow was followed by Jim Hines , who was followed by Johnny " Lam " Jones , who was followed by Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson on the Memorial Stadium track , those new feats will produce future memories just as enduring . <p> One Beginning <p> After two nights spent on a mattress on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of something special about to be witnessed . Even the sports editor of the Texas A &M; student newspaper , together with Jones Ramsey , then the school 's sports information director , could tell . They were at the Texas Relays courtesy of Jack Gallagher , the well-known columnist/sports writer for the Houston Post , whose expense account was to cover the cost of the room and some of the meals for the trio . <p> That 1955 Texas Relays was the first for this writer , and it proved to be an event worthy of sleeping on a floor to attend . Sleeping accommodations were better for the four decades worth of future Relays that were reported later . <p> Bobby Morrow won the 100-yard dash , a year before his triple gold-medal performance at the ' 56 Olympics . Wes Santee , faltering briefly coming off the final turn into the wind , barely missed the first Texas Relays sub-4 minute mile , clocking 4:00.5 . <p> Taking it on the ' Lam ' <p> Even now , more than two decades after what ranks as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first held in 1911 at Clark Field , across the street from Memorial Stadium ) , Johnny " Lam " Jones hears a tale that makes the telephone shake with his laughter . <p> Jones earlier had won the 100-yard dash in 9.4 seconds , equaling the Class 3A meet record , and then set a state record in winning the 220 in 21.0 for Lampasas High School . Earlier in the year , he had been timed in a stunning 9.05 for the 100 , though wind-aided , and 20.7 for the 220 . As the 1976 meet came down to the concluding mile relay , Lampasas and several other schools were battling for the team championship . <p> Accounts vary as to how much ground Jones had to make up when he got the baton for his anchor leg on the mile relay . The most accurate distance seems to be 40 yards , although some estimates made it 50 or more . Jones , nicknamed " Lam " to distinguish him from Johnny " Ham " Jones of Hamlin , who like " Lam " was a UT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deficit was . <p> " I wish I could have seen it , " Jones says . " I had my head turned to get the baton so I never was sure . I just felt that I had a job to do , like my teammates had done , and like them , I was going to leave it all on the track . I knew I was n't eighth because one team had dropped the stick . " <p> Jones , conscious of saving something for the stretch run , quickly began passing the six runners in front of him . By the time he reached the final turn , only two remained . <p> " For some reason , both of them moved a little to the outside so that I had just enough room to pass them on the inside , " Jones says . " If I 'd had to go around them , I do n't know if I 'd have made it . " <p> He jetted past a runner from Brenham , who was in the lead , to carry Lampasas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , about seven yards ahead of Brenham , and to the school 's first state championship by a two-point margin . The official results list Jones ' anchor at 45.5 . Scott Boyd , his coach who is now his business associate in the Fort Worth area , timed him in 45.1 . <p> Years later , one of the runners who was passed by Jones told Waco Tribune-Herald sports writer Mickey Humphrey that " Lam went past me going so fast , the wind blast blew my shorts almost to my knees . " <p> Responds Jones with a laugh : " Sure , and I also stopped and helped him pin them up . It 's like a good fish story . There 's always something added . " <p> For a few seconds afterward , recalls one onlooker : " It was so quiet , you could have heard a pin drop . " Then hundreds of spectators , many of them from Lampasas , and other athletes swarmed the field . <p> Says future Rice coach Ray Davidson , who was in the stands : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way through and bumped one of the others , but if the official had disqualified him , he might have gotten lynched . . . . We could n't believe what we had seen ; it was one of those performances that will always be talked about when the state meet is brought up . " <p> Later that summer , thanks to funds raised by Lampasas citizens , Jones was able to qualify for the Olympic Trials , where he placed fourth at Eugene , Ore. , at age 18 . Runner-up Houston McTear pulled a hamstring in the final , and Jones replaced him as an Olympic entry , finishing sixth in the 100 at Montreal . Jones won an Olympic gold medal in the 400-meter relay , teaming with Harvey Glance , Steve Riddick and Millard Hampton . <p> As a UT freshman in ' 77 , his only collegiate track season , Jones won the SWC 100- and 220-yard sprints . <p> Fittingly , Jones will be the honorary referee of the 1998 state meet Friday and Saturday . <p> There will be no official auld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Peter Contreras , assistant athletic director of the University Interscholastic League . Instead , assured by UT officials that the new stadium will be ready on time , the UIL will arrange a reunion of former state-meet stars at the ' 99 event . <p> Near , or at , the top <p> Bill McMurray covered the high school state meet for the Chronicle from 1960 through 1996 . He does n't know if he witnessed a better one than in 1985 , when a crowd of 35,000 watched the Saturday session of the University Interscholastic League 's first meet in which boys and girls competed on the same weekend . <p> Friday night , Joe DeLoach of Bay City , the Class 4A 100-meter favorite and apparent winner , was standing on the top step of the awards stand to accept his first-place medal , only to be told a review of the finish placed him second . <p> " You could almost see the steam coming out of Joe 's ears in the 200 , he was so ' pumped , ' " McMurray says . <p> DeLoach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20.5 seconds that stood for less than 24 hours . <p> Saturday , Stanley Kerr of Class A Snook matched the time set by DeLoach , a future Olympic gold medalist ( 200 , 1988 at Seoul ) . <p> That same day , Dallas Roosevelt , anchored by Roy Martin , tied the national high school 400-meter relay record of 40.2 , held since 1970 by Dallas Lincoln , aided by the Pouncey brothers , Joe and Gene . Future Olympian Cheryl Dickey anchored Smiley 's 400 and 800 relays which tied state records in each event . Carlette Guidry , then a 15-year-old sophomore at Houston Sterling , won the 100 , long jump and triple jump , ran on the winning 1,600 relay team and was second in the 200 to Chryste Gaines of Dallas South Oak Cliff . <p> Guidry and Gaines went on to compete in the Olympics . Sterling 's Tanya Davis clocked a national-record 13.2 in the 100-meter hurdles , breaking the mark held by Carol Lewis of Willingboro , N.J. , since 1980 . <p> But Martin added even more excitement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20.4 clocking and then turning a 45.8 anchor leg on Roosevelt 's winning 3:09.4 in the 1,600 relay . Martin 's time , adjusted to 20.13 for fully automatic timing , stands as the high school record . <p> " That had to be one of the greatest of all state meets , " says McMurray , who compiled the state high school track and field rankings for four decades . A few of his favorite performances : <p> Dave Morton of Spring Branch Memorial , setting a state half-mile record of 1:49.2 in 1967 and then running a 46.7 leg for a national-record 3:11.8 effort in the mile relay ; <p> Future world-record holder and Olympic champion Randy Matson of Pampa setting a meet record of 66 feet , 10 1/2 inches in the shot put ; <p> Michael Carter of Dallas Jefferson throwing the shot 75-9 , a national record , in 1979 ( later improved to 81-3 1/2 by Carter that summer ) ; <p> Houston Sterling scoring 104 points to win the ' 86 girls state title with Guidry winning the 100 , 200 , triple jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long jump ; <p> Needville 's Anthony Ketchum winning four consecutive titles in the 400 that included a national-record 45.5 ; <p> Robert Gonzales of Falfurrias taking four consecutive mile championships , including a 4:07.4 clocking in 1967 ; <p> Refugio 's Toya Jones , who scored a UIL-record 147 career points at the state meet , where he was the meet 's high scorer four consecutive years ; <p> Then there was half-miler George " Crazy Horse " Jones of Yates , an all-time favorite character who ran with a tiny toy parachute in each hand , which he expanded in the breeze as he crossed the finish line . Jones warmed up for his 880 race at one state meet by running from Memorial Stadium and up the steps to the state Capitol and back to the stadium . Alas , he finished back in the pack . <p> Differing memories <p> Bubba Thornton , the University of Texas coach , attended his first meet at Memorial Stadium while a seventh-grader at Keller in 1959 . As a senior competing at the state meet , he recalls " losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 . I thought I had won both . Then I went to get my stuff and somebody had stolen my ' flats ' so I left the stadium barefooted . " <p> But not bare of memories as he watches the construction at Memorial Stadium and nearby at the new track facility . <p> Thornton relishes the thought that Bob Irvin , his first coach , later won a state championship at Fort Worth Carter-Riverside . And Lee Williams , a teammate of Thornton 's at Texas Christian , is bringing his Fort Worth Wyatt 400 relay team to the state meet this weekend after it set a national record of 39.99 in the regional meet at Lubbock . <p> Ted Nelson , then a senior at Andrews High School , came to the 1961 state meet having set a national record of 46.5 in the 400 at the regional in Odessa . With only 37 minutes between the 440 and mile relay , he won the quarter in a conservative 48.0 and then helped his team to a meet-record 3:15.2 in the mile relay and the state title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach in 1967 while a Bryan High School assistant and then many more as the assistant and now head coach at Texas A &M.; Before Lam Jones ' near-mythical run at the ' 76 state meet , Nelson estimates he watched Jones make up about 90 yards on the anchor of the mile relay in a meet at Bryan . <p> Among Nelson 's top memories are Marlon Ramsey 's record run in the 400 at the 1994 state meet . With the runners in their starting blocks , a thunderstorm swamped the track and forced a 45-minute delay . Ramsey , running for Beaumont West Brook , stepped back out and blazed to a 45.3 . <p> Between his own high school career and this week 's finale , Nelson figures he has missed only two state meets , both when the SWC meet was on the same weekend . Nelson and many contemporaries face the same situation this week , with the Big 12 Conference meet on the same dates . <p> " I was n't there for the first one or the last one , " Nelson says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a lot of them in between . " <p> So has Baylor 's Clyde Hart during his 35 years as Bears coach . <p> Hart terms the demise of the Memorial Stadium track " a real tragedy , a blow to track and field in Texas . Traditionally , it 's been such a great setting . . . It was good for track and field and it was good for the University of Texas , and they 're the ones who made the move . . . I 'm sure it will be a nice ( new ) stadium , but it would be like moving the Penn Relays or Drake Relays to another stadium . " <p> Adds Nelson : " No question there will be a lot of regrets . It was a happening that I 'm not sure will take place again . Maybe the great athletes will make it happen again . I 'm not saying they should n't do it . It 's not for me to say but progress goes on . " <p> Thornton , for one , is sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the guys and women that turned in all the great performances , " he says . " The stadium gave them a great setting . But they will learn to love the new place . The athletes in there will create the same electricity . " <p> <p> Memorial Stadium 's magic moments <p> Jerry Wizig takes a look at some of the great track and field performances staged at Memorial Stadium , which has hosted the NCAA , Texas Relays and state high school meets : <p> Johnny " Lam " Jones was timed between 45.1 and 45.5 during his mile-relay anchor in which he overcame a 40- to 50-yard deficit during the 1976 state meet . <p> A 37.89-second clocking in the 400-meter relay in 1994 by the Santa Monica Track Club team of Mike Marsh , Leroy Burrell , Floyd Heard and Carl Lewis , the fastest ever run in the United States ( until Canada 's 37.69 at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics ) . <p> NCAA meet and stadium records of 9.97 , UTEP 's Olapade Adeniken , 100 meters ; 44.00 , USC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Erick Walder , long jump ; 220-0 , Nevada 's Kamy Keshmiri , discus ; 3:27.53 , Florida , women 's 4x400 relay , all during the 1992 NCAA championships .
