Today 's economy means higher tuition and fewer scholarships for graduate study . But starting this fall , grad students will get a big break when it comes to repaying federally backed loans . That 's when they 'll be able to ask the government to let them pay a percentage of their income instead of a standard fixed monthly amount . Although mortgages and other loans are hard to come by , grad students can still borrow the full cost of their studies through federally backed programs . Those programs cover not only all tuition and fees but also transportation , books , and reasonable living costs . The big change is that " income-based repayment " will allow those with small paychecks or big debts to cap their monthly payments at less than 15 percent of their income ( details : box , Page 61 ) . Best of all , graduates whose incomes are low because they 're in public service jobs may have some of their loans forgiven . " Loan repayment options and forgiveness are getting better and better every year , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Rights Project in San Juan , Texas , who racked up about $70,000 in debt from college and law school and has received help paying it down from her alma mater , Lewis &; Clark Law School , and from a nonprofit . Spencer-Scheurich , who got her law degree in 2004 , says she 's managed to afford a car and a house despite making less than $50,000 a year at a job she loves . She plans to apply for the feds ' new income-based repayment program when it opens for business July 1 . The first step . Students hoping to borrow their way through graduate school should first apply for federal education loans . Even when credit is tight , these are easy to get , and they 're usually the lowest-cost options . Federal grad loans are available to almost all students and can be obtained directly from the federal government , through private lenders such as Sallie Mae , and from state nonprofit educational lending agencies ( a list is at www.efc.org ) . A search tool for cheap federal loans is at **33;3185;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following order : Cheapest . Some schools offer low-income grad students federal Perkins loans , which charge no interest while the student is in school and only 5 percent afterward . These are the cheapest education loans currently available . Unfortunately , Perkins funding is limited , so many otherwise qualified students ca n't get them . Fairly cheap . Almost all grad students can get at least $20,500 a year in federal Stafford loans , which this fall will charge a maximum annual rate of 7.14 percent ( after counting all fees ) . Low-income Stafford borrowers will be charged no interest while they are in school and only about 5.9 percent ( counting fees ) after they leave . Next-to-last resort . Students who need more than the Stafford maximum can borrow their remaining cost of attendance through the federal Grad PLUS program , which will charge a maximum of 9.2 percent in annual interest this fall . Last resort . Some students , including those who have fallen behind on their undergraduate federal loans and many international students , do n't qualify for federal loans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get a private loan from a bank is if they can find a U.S. citizen with good credit to guarantee repayment . A few schools help by making small loans , and some students raise money from private citizens by using social networking sites such as greennote.com . But private loans are expensive . What 's worse : Many loan repayment programs wo n't cover these loans . If you 're already working . Those who have already left school and want help repaying their loans have several places to turn . Government . For several years , the feds , the states , and many local governments have offered loan forgiveness to teachers , healthcare workers , and other in-demand professionals willing to work in underserved areas . The big news for all current and aspiring grad students is that , starting July 1 , anyone with federal education debt can apply to lower his or her payments and have part of the loans forgiven . The first step will be to consolidate any existing loans with the federal government ( go to **28;3220;TOOLONG ) and apply for income-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty level ( which is currently $10,400 for a single person ) wo n't have to pay a penny on their federal education debts . On any payments , those whose income has remained low because they 've been doing public service work ( for a government or nonprofit employer ) can have their remaining debt wiped clean . And after 25 years of payments , the same goes for other low-income grads . Nonprofits . A growing number of charities and professional associations are starting funds to pay down the debts of public servants . The California Dental Association Foundation , for example , is helping to pay off the loans of four dentists serving in low-income clinics on the West Coast . James Forester , who agreed to a salary half the going rate of private dentists to work at a clinic in Paso Robles , says that the foundation will pay off most of his remaining debt -- which once surpassed $150,000 -- if he stays at the clinic three years . A growing number of professional schools -- law , business , public policy , and others -- are offering to help grads who go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as LRAPs , or loan repayment assistance programs . Anyone considering public service should target graduate schools with generous LRAPs . Many LRAPS will even pay down at least some debts for those who perform only a year or two of public service . School-funded LRAPs can help out people who would n't benefit from the new government payment plans . Spencer-Scheurich , the Texas attorney , says borrowing lots of money and then having to jump through bureaucratic hoops to get the debts repaid is a hassle . But keeping her payments low and arranging to wipe out tens of thousands of dollars of debt are worth it . Besides , she says , " I 'm a lawyer . Hopefully , I can handle it . "
