IN AN ELECTION YEAR , BEWARE THE pundit or politician tossing about the word " values . " Remember to ask the key question , " Whose values ? " In the case of Ben J. Wattenberg , whose new book , Values Matter Most ( Free Press ; 426 pages ; $25 ) , has already managed to grab a few headlines , that question is as tangled as ever . <P> Wattenberg , 62 , a columnist and think tanker for the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute , makes much of his Democratic credentials : if he refers to his years as a speechwriter for Lyndon B. Johnson once , he does so a dozen times . He lays out his lifetime voting record , which reveals he is that mottled beast , a Reagan Democrat . He voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 . And so he presents his book essentially as an open letter to Clinton , describing how the President has strayed from the centrist positions that got him elected and suggesting ways in which he  --  or whoever captures the " values " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not the economy , stupid , Wattenberg says ; what voters really care about is social issues , especially welfare , crime , education and affirmative action . <P> Although debatable , this is not a revolutionary argument . But Wattenberg has already provoked the sort of response book publishers dream of : when Clinton picked up Values Matter Most recently , he found himself moved to call the author . Their long chat prompted Wattenberg to dash off a newspaper column in which he quoted the President as acknowledging that he had " changed philosophically " during the past few years : a statement the White House now vehemently denies . <P> Wattenberg is at his most impressive when dealing with the specifics of the disjunction between what Clinton promised and how he has governed . These rare sharp moments , however , are surrounded by more stuffing than last week 's Thanksgiving turkey . Wattenberg fills 400 windy and repetitive pages with folksy statements ( " Is there hope for American kids ? You bet there is " ) and self-important quotations from his own previous work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The book was also clearly rushed into print , riddled with typographical and factual errors that make the reader wonder what else the author may have got wrong . He says , for example , that Richard Allen Davis was convicted for the murder of Polly Klaas , when in fact a venue for his trial has not yet been chosen . <P> Even more irritating is Wattenberg 's sloppy thinking . The author claims , for instance , that while quotas trouble many Americans , the average voter is not all that concerned with race . His basis for this ? Discussions in two focus groups in which 1 of 19 participants was black . And his readiness to gloss over some of the Republicans ' rhetorical excesses is troubling . The 1988 Bush campaign 's Willie Horton attack ads , for instance , raised a valid issue , he says , and were not racist . Writes Wattenberg : " If he had been white and looked like a thug  --  which Horton did  --  his photograph would still have been used . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
