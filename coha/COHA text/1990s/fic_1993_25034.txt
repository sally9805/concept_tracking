 | confident again . He went outside and got his dinner , banging the tray against the metal table . " What is this fucking shit , man ? " he said to the man sitting next to him . " Dog shit . See , they keep a big black dog  --  like a Doberman or something  --  downstairs in the kitchen just to shit us dinner . Saves the taxpayers a lot of bread . " " Yeah , " he said , pushing the food around on his plate . He could almost smell the dog shit . The other inmate had long , stringy hair past his shoulders and tattoos covering almost every inch of his exposed flesh . He looked like a biker . On one muscular bicep he sported a Harley-Davidson tattoo . The Latino sniffed and realized it was the man he was smelling and not the food . He picked up his fork and started shoving the substance on his plate into his mouth . " You stink , man . Smells like that dog been shitting on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grabbing it under the lip with two tattooed hands . He looked like a fool . It was bolted to the floor . Instead he tossed his metal dinner plate in the air like a Frisbee and threw his head back laughing . Then he growled and suddenly reached down and grabbed the other man 's shirt near the collar . With one hand he lifted him off the bench and held him several feet off the ground . " Put me the fuck down , you stinking piece of dog shit , " he yelled , his stomach rolling over and over in fear and humiliation , his bowels rumbling , ready to explode . The other men were laughing and crowding around , obscuring the commotion from the television monitors . " Look what we got here , " the biker said , holding his shirt now with both hands , moving him from side to side , causing his legs to swing in the air . " Looks like we got us an Oxnard cockroach . What we need is a little sombrero . This fucker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats they put in them drinks and put it right on his greasy little beaner head . " They were all laughing now , hooting and hollering , slapping their sides . A small older man with neatly trimmed hair reached  | out suddenly and squeezed his balls , a sly expression on his face . He tried to kick the man 's face but missed and kicked out at air . Sweat was popping out of his pores , soaking his shirt , dripping onto the tile floor . Just then a shrill tone went off , the man instantly released him , and he fell . He started to get up , pushing himself off the floor with his hands , when a black shoe came from the sea of legs and rushed toward his chest , connecting and knocking him on his back , taking his breath away . The loudspeaker blasted : " All inmates return to their cells . I repeat , all inmates return to their cells at once . " Suddenly he was alone in the middle of the floor , on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big black man bent over and offered his hand . " Get the fuck away from me , man , " he said , his voice weak and cracking . The guard was standing outside the quad , staring at him through the bars . " You hurt ? " the guard asked . He did n't answer . This was all her fault . He got up and headed to his cell . His chest throbbed where the man had kicked him , and the disgusting man who had grabbed his balls was smirking at him , winking at him from his cell . The biker walked up behind the small man and draped an arm over his thin shoulders . Together they smiled at him . The biker 's teeth were yellow and cracked . The little man was the biker 's woman . Willie had told him that the two men had known each other for years from San Quentin and had set up housekeeping on the outside when they were released , living like man and wife . The little man had robbed a bank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parole . How they got in the same cell , he did n't know . They must have paid someone , one of the jailers . Because he could n't pay , he 'd ended up in a cell with a black instead of a homeboy . He did n't steal  --  most of the time  --  it was n't his style . Stealing was dishonest . He hated thieves . They were the real scum  --  the lowest of the low . Anyone could steal . The biker probably stunk because he had AIDS , he  | thought . People with AIDS always smelled . It was because they were always shitting and sometimes there was no toilet paper in the cells . In here , everyone knew everything , even when you took a crap . He held his head up and threw his shoulders back , spitting as he walked by their cell . " I 'm gon na fucking slice you , man , " he said under his breath . " One day I 'm gon na slice you both like ripe tomatoes . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cat , man . " The two men laughed . Soon all the men in the quad were laughing and banging their cups against the bars . They were laughing at him . He was an object of ridicule now . The harassment would be relentless . Unless he killed someone and risked going to the slammer for life , he 'd have to endure it until he was released . And he would be released . It was just a matter of time . She 'd been the reason he 'd been late to dinner , he thought , tasting the bitterness on his tongue like he 'd been eating with a rusty fork . If he had n't been late , this would 've never happened , he would have never mouthed off to the biker . The other inmates did n't know him . They did n't know what he was capable of , what he 'd done , what he could do . But she would know . Soon , he thought , walking into his cell . She 'd know soon enough . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the common room , seeing nothing , waiting for the electronic doors to clang shut . He 'd teach her humiliation . He 'd teach her to cry . In his mind he saw tears as red as blood running down her cheeks , washing over the freckles , staining her face a bright pink . The image he saw reminded him of a statue of the Virgin Mary  --  one of those miracles they talked about all the time where tears mysteriously fell from the statue and people came from all over the world , thinking they would be cured from some disease . He chuckled , his shoulders moving up and down . A miracle . She 'd pray for a fucking miracle , he thought , feeling better now . When he finished with her , people could come and look at her and take  | pictures of her . Maybe they 'd put her picture on the front page of the newspaper . Then people would know him , fear him , give him the respect he deserved . Then they 'd all know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard Willie talking from the bunk below . " I seen your back , boy . When you takes off ' n your shirt , I sees it . You been whupped . An ' you cries . In da night , you cries . " He pressed his hands over his ears . Lies . . . it was nothing but lies . It was n't him crying , it was them . " Don ' you be ' fraid now . I ai n't gon na hurt ya , you hyeah me ? Sees , I was grown in Alabama an ' my daddy was whupped . I ai n't nev'r gon na hurt a man been whupped . Dat man been hurt enuf . " He tasted his own salty , silent tears , his fingers closing on the crucifix around his neck , his mind erasing the words Willie had just spoken . He closed his eyes and dreamed he was swimming in a sea of frothy violet blood . It burned his eyes . He tried to reach the surface and then found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck , thick strands strangled him , choking him until his eyes popped out of his head and immediately disappeared in the mass of tentacles . Around his legs and feet he felt the rope-like cords cut into his flesh . He was drowning in a living , swirling mass of red hair .  | Lily 's heels sank into the soft dirt as she walked to a position behind the plate at the community center playing field and laced her fingers into the wire fence . Shana was pitching and she made eye contact as her right arm moved back for the pitch . The other parents in the bleachers wore down-filled jackets and sipped steaming coffee from Styrofoam cups . Lily wrapped her arms around herself in an attempt to stay warm . Her daughter was charismatic . That was the only way to describe the type of popularity that she had been blessed with since the first grade . A ball of energy , beauty , and quick wit , she had been the most adorable little girl Lily had ever seen . And she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter what was going on in her career , Lily saw her entire universe spinning around Shana . Her daughter had been the one who convinced Lily that there was goodness in the world , real goodness . She had taught Lily how to smile , laugh , cry tears of joy . And she was slipping away , growing up , changing into a woman . She did n't need Lily anymore . She had her father to meet her every need . Whereas Lily had always been  | John 's baby , his little girl in many ways , Shana was now all he cared about . The problems with Shana were more than just the Oedipal phase of puberty . John was turning her own daughter against her for reasons Lily just could n't understand . Was it because she had told him she wanted to become a judge ? John had always dreamed of her entering private practice , where she would " make a ton of money " and he could retire and spend his time managing their investments . A position on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notch above what she presently earned . John did n't understand . He told Lily she was a fool , insisting that she wanted the judgeship for the power alone , simply to feed her ego . Shana had been only a few months old when Lily decided to enter law school . It was a major decision . Lily was working as an admitting clerk at a local hospital and John at a personnel agency . His salary varied from month to month , and the only way they could afford to get by was for Lily to continue working . John encouraged her to go , talking constantly about all the money she would make and how they 'd never have to pinch pennies again . " You go to law school , " he had said , " and I 'll open my own personnel agency . We 'll have it made . " Lily worked the graveyard shift and attended classes during the day . She left her daughter with the sitter only during the hours she was in class . The remainder of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly chattering to the baby just as if she were an adult . To this day , Lily could remember the exact second Shana had started to talk . It was n't so remarkable , she only said " da da " like all babies say . Then she started chattering away like a magpie ; all the words Lily had said to her seemed to pop back out like magic . The more the child talked , the more Lily talked to her . She knew all kinds of legal words . People would ask her what her name was and she would smile and say , " plain-tiff . " Thinking she had said " plain tough , " they would roar with laughter . Shana would clap and giggle and say it again .  | Lily never once spanked the child . She read every book she could get her hands on relating to parenting and used them all . " We do n't bite children , " she would say to her , " but we can bite an apple . " Although Lily slept only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding off at work in the early morning hours , she was happy . She had no time to worry about her relationship with her husband . Her grueling schedule left little time for him . He did n't appear to notice . She accepted a position with the district attorney 's office about the time Shana went to school . Every morning Lily would make her lunch and walk her to school before work . Her classmates loved her . She knew how to share , loved to make children and adults laugh , and was a regular Pippi Longstockings with her carrot-colored hair and freckles . In a way , those first words , " plain tough , " also applied to little Shana . She feared nothing . Lily wanted it that way , wanted her to be able to protect herself against anyone and anything . Just as she taught Shana how to share and be kind to others , she tried to teach her to be strong , brave , and mature . " When I 'm not here , " she would tell her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ever happens , then you must pretend you are a grown-up and do exactly what a grown-up would do and believe you can do it , because you can . " Shana would always blink her eyes and smile when Lily made her speech . She looked for occasions when she could prove herself to her mother , knowing it would make Lily smile with approval . With Lily 's encouragement she climbed trees , played ball , would stomp on a spider rather than scream , and once punched a neighbor 's dog in the nose when it growled at her . Then she ran all the way to the house and leaped into Lily 's arms , bursting with pride . To John and Lily , she was the golden child , the magic child . As the years went by and the magic persisted , Shana learned to see it and use it for the power it afforded her . Seeking to bask in her light , her fans would do her homework , give her  | money , let her wear their new clothes before even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years before . John 's influence grew stronger . Shana began snapping at her parents at home and developed quite a temper . Lily refused to tolerate it , but John undermined her and allowed Shana to order him around like a child . The fissure between them as parents widened . Lily tried to talk to her , to use the old psychology tricks , but nothing worked . Finally she had sat down with her and discussed her behavior at home . " You just do n't understand , " Shana told her . " All day long I have to smile and be nice to everyone . Sometimes when I get home I ca n't control it any longer . " She had to defend her turf as the most popular girl in school . Other girls would get envious and make up stories about her . Like a politician constantly seeking reelection , she would have to seal her position , take polls , make certain her constituents would vote for her . On one occasion a girl punched her in the face after school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her to give it up , but she could n't . It was a hard thing to give up , this being on top . Like Lily , Shana was tenacious and driven to control the world around her . Just the past month Shana had come home in a particularly nasty mood and Lily had broached the subject again . " Most people have a few good friends in their life that they enjoy . Why do you have to persist in having ten or fifteen ? Why is it so important that everyone like you ? " " You do n't understand , " Shana said . " It 's not like that at all . They need me . " Lily shook her head , incredulous . " That 's absurd . They do n't need you . What are you saying ? " Then she had thought about it . " Are you saying that someone has to be a leader ? That if that person is n't you , it will be someone else ? " " Yeah , that 's it , " Shana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke or listen to death rock or go all the way with boys . I get good  | grades  --  pretty good , anyway  --  and I give people advice , listen to their problems . Girls get into fights with other girls and I get them to make up . " So that 's the story , Lily had thought . Sounded like her reasons for being a district attorney and wanting to be a judge . Since she had defeated the demons of her childhood , she had held the reins in her own two hands and had taught her daughter to do the same . The short brunette at bat swung and connected ; the parents in the stands screamed as she raced the short distance to first base . The next batter hit the ball as well , but was tagged at first base . The game was over and Shana 's team had won . The girls moved to the dugout , the majority getting as close to Shana as possible . Post-game activity had changed since the year before . Instead of going for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were taking out brushes and lipsticks from their purses . John infiltrated the group of girls , putting both hands around Shana 's waist and lifting her into the air . " I 'm so proud of you , " he said . They both saw Lily a few feet away and smiled . They were n't smiling at her . Lily knew they were flaunting their closeness , showing her that this was their private moment , one they did n't care to share . Placing Shana back on the ground , John stared straight at Lily and draped his arm over Shana 's shoulders , walking with her the short distance to the dugout , pulling her close , glancing back again to see if Lily was still watching , the other girls crowding around John now as well as Shana . Lily winced , locking her fingers on the wire fence . They both looked away . A few minutes later , John headed in her direction , stooping to pick up a few bats on the way . The baseball cap made thick crevices appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than his wife . Even though his hair was thinning to the point where more scalp showed than hair , he was still an attractive man , with a robust laugh and a bright smile , displaying rows of even white teeth in his tan and masculine  | face . His expression was not pleasant , though , nor was it the adoring look reserved for his daughter . " Made it , huh ? " he said flatly , tipping his baseball cap back on his head . " Pried yourself away to catch the last five minutes of the game . You sure you 're not missing something at the office ? I mean , you do n't want your family to get in the way of your big ambitions to be judge , now , do you ? " " Stop it , " she said , looking around to see if anyone was in earshot . " I 'll take Shana home in my car . " She turned and plodded through the dirt in the direction of the dugout . Shana 's face was flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other girls . Her long red hair had more gold tones in it than Lily 's , and she wore it in a ponytail pulled through the back of her baseball cap . Her wide-set eyes were such a deep shade of sapphire that they almost matched the navy blue lettering on her uniform . High , pronounced cheekbones gave her face an ethereal , elegant quality far beyond her years . With the right makeup , clothes , and photographer , the right push-up bra , Lily thought , Shana 's face could be on the cover of next month 's Cosmopolitan magazine . One girl followed as she broke away and headed for the car . " Call me in thirty minutes , " Shana said . Once they were home , the phone in her room would ring for the next hour , each girl calling at a preselected time . " Oh , this is my mom . Mom , this is Sally . " Sally stood there with her mouth gaping . " You look so much alike . I ca n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , her eyes cutting to her mother with resentment . Lily felt her heart sink . Shana had always been so proud that they looked alike . She used to tell Lily how all her friends thought her mother was so pretty . Lily remembered how she 'd gaze up at her and ask her if she 'd be that tall when she grew up . The past week , Shana had screamed at her that she was a giraffe , the tallest girl in school , and ended the tirade by saying it was Lily 's fault . She tried to start a conversation . " That was a great job of  | pitching out there . Sorry I did n't get to see more of the game . I rushed , but the traffic . . . " Shana stared straight ahead , refusing to answer . Lily swallowed . It was going to be one of those days . " How was school ? " " Fine . " " Do you have much homework ? " " Done . " " Want to go roller skating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have gym class . I do n't need the outside activities . " " How about the mall ? Do you want to go to the mall ? " " I thought I was grounded . " She shot Lily another look full of animosity . " Can Charlotte and Sally go ? " " No , I want to spend time with you alone . I do n't want to spend time with Charlotte and Sally . Besides , where is my top you loaned Charlotte without my permission ? " " Do n't worry , you 'll get your precious top back . I just forgot . Will you chill out , Mom ? " With this last statement her voice went high and shrill . Then something came to mind and she turned to her mother with a sweet smile and a sugar-coated voice . " I need a new outfit . There 's a dance in the gym next week and we 're all going . " Here we go , Lily thought , feeling the burning in her chest again . In desperation she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started buying her things in the past year or so just to get that one little smile . As a parent , she felt she was on a seesaw . One minute she tried to uphold her long-standing rules and restrictions . The next minute everything fell away , and she broke all her own rules . To compete with John she had to play a new game , his game . His game was to give Shana anything she wanted . " I just bought you all those things two weeks ago , Shana . Ca n't you wear one of those to the dance ? " " Mom . . . I 've already worn them to school . I do n't want to wear them to the dance . " " We 'll see , " she said , stalling , pacifying.  | Shana stared out the passenger window . " So , what else is going on ? Any gossip ? " " I started my period today . " Lily was excited and it showed . Shana rolled her eyes around in disbelief at her excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share . Now , Lily thought , they could go home and lock themselves in the bedroom and talk about this , the way they 'd used to talk about everything . " I knew you 'd start any day now . Did n't I tell you that I started at your age ? That 's why you 've been so snappy and emotional . I was , too . It 's normal . You 're a real woman now . Do you have cramps ? How do you feel ? We 'll stop at the drugstore . What are you wearing now ? " Lily knew she was rattling on and on , but she did n't care . This could be a new beginning for them . " Dad already got me some pads today . " Lily 's knuckles turned white on the steering wheel . She took her foot off the gas , and the car came to an abrupt standstill in the suburban traffic . Cars honked and then passed . She turned to face her daughter . " You could have called me at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you shutting me out of your life ? " She had to hear the words ; like a masochist , she sought the pain . " Dad said you were too busy and not to bother you . " The words " Dad already got me some pads today " were ringing in her ears ; now they were joined by " Dad said you were too busy . " In the act of not sharing that one historically female moment , the rite of passage , and the fact that she could go to her father without embarrassment , her daughter had destroyed her . They drove home in silence . John arrived home shortly after Lily and Shana . Located in what once had been the farming community of Camarillo , twenty minutes from Ventura , the house was a spacious twenty-year-old ranch with paned windows . John went and made a bowl of ice cream for himself and Shana , and carried her dish  | to her in her room ; she was on the phone with the door shut . He walked in , handed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shana reached up without looking and tugged lightly on his shirt , still talking to the girl on the phone , until he leaned down near her face . She kissed him on the mouth and immediately returned to the conversation . He smiled and left , returning to the family room to eat his ice cream in front of the television . Lily was standing in the hall . She stepped back for John to pass , glaring at him . Then she went to take a shower . They did this after every game , and John had never once asked Lily if she wanted a bowl of ice cream . She stood in the bathroom fully clothed and stared in the mirror . She was an unwanted intruder  --  an outcast in her own home . Without her salary they could n't even afford this house . Without all the late nights and the hard work and the stress that had put years on her face . John just wanted to punch a time clock , collect his check , coach softball , watch television , and wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did talk , which was rare , John wanted to talk about spaceships and aliens and life after death , issues that delineated the world he lived in from the stark reality of Lily 's world . She walked into the den and looked at him on the sofa . " Can we turn the television off ? I want to talk . " He jumped up . " I just remembered . Shana has the cramps , poor baby , and I told her I would bring her some Tylenol . " He headed to the kitchen cabinet . Lily grabbed the two pills out of his hand and snapped , " I 'll take her the Tylenol . Afterward , I 'll meet you in the backyard . I want to talk . " In the backyard , Shana would be unable to hear . At least on one issue they agreed : not arguing in front of their daughter . She opened Shana 's door . She was still on the phone , sitting on the floor in the corner , so much junk on her bed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the phone now and go to bed . You 'll never get up in the morning . "  | The phone was left on its side as Shana strode over to her mother . " I 'll get off in just a minute . " " I brought you a few Tylenol for the cramps . " " Did you bring me any water ? " " The bathroom is just two feet away , Shana . Look . See , it 's still there . " " Dad , bring me a glass of water on your way , " she yelled . " On my way , darling , " he answered and was there in a second , entering the room as Lily backed out . Lily stood with her back against the hall wall and listened to the two of them talk , discussing the game  --  John praising and bragging on her pitching . She could tell that Shana was standing on tiptoes and hugging him around the neck as she did every night , kissing him tenderly on the cheek . He walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands crossed over her chest . He waited for her to pass and followed her into the backyard . John took a seat in the lounger ; Lily sat in a nylon chair across from him . It was dark and the only light was from the neighboring house . The only noise was their television heard through an open window . The amber end of his cigarette reminded her of the fireflies she used to chase as a child , sometimes capturing one in a jar . " Where did you go last night ? " he said . " I had a late meeting . I told Shana to tell you , but I guess you never woke up . " Lily was thankful for the darkness , so he could n't see her face . She had always been a poor liar . He had once told her that whenever she lied , her nostrils flared . " I saw you , " he said , his voice a mixture of anger and sad-ness . Lily rubbed her arms in the damp night air , his words playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talking about ? Surely , he did n't mean what she thought he meant . " Oh , really , " she said , " and what exactly did you see ? " He was silent . Then he repeated himself . " I saw you . "  | " Look , John , do n't play games with me . What are you talking about ? " " I want you to move out . " He stood and the voice now was all bitterness , all conviction , the voice of a man who was no longer playing a game . " Did you hear me ? I want you out of this house by tomorrow . " He was standing over Lily , and she looked up in the dark . Her eyes followed the glowing end of his cigarette , the dark outline of his arm in motion as he flicked it toward the dirt side of the yard . She waited for it to explode like a firecracker , counting the seconds , holding her breath . She thought of spontaneous combustion , her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His arm was flying toward her , a night bird , a bat , the sound of his shirt wings flapping , the slap across her face the dreaded collision . " Move in with your boyfriend  --  the guy you were making out with last night in the parking lot . " Lily caught his arm in an iron grip . In front of her she saw an enormous stack of white dishes crashing to the ground and the pieces flying in the air . " You want me to move out ? " she screamed . " You disgusting piece of shit . You think I want to spend the rest of my life with you , working my ass off while you lounge around in front of the television and turn my own daughter against me ? " He yanked his arm away . " I never turned Shana against you . You 're just too busy with your cases and your career to pay attention to your own child . " He was spitting the words out between clenched teeth , his chest heaving . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That we go on welfare or something so we can both be here every minute in case Shana needs a glass of water ? You 've spoiled her rotten . She was a beautiful child and now she 's a disrespectful , demanding brat . " She stopped , regretting her last statement . " Now you 're probably going to run in there and tell her what I said . Do n't you realize that you hurt her , too , when you do  | this , repeat things I say to you in private ? Go ahead . Tell her . I do n't give a shit anymore . " She stepped back into the nylon chair and almost tripped . With one hand she seized the chair and threw it onto the dirt side of the yard . " Look at the yard , John . You do n't even see that one side is dirt . It does n't bother you at all . You only see what you want to see . " " You 're a slut , a whore . You let that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a controlled level . " Like a receptacle , John ? Is that what you want to say ? That I let him use me like a receptacle ? " He did n't answer . " Maybe if you were a man and treated me like a woman , a wife , then I would n't have needed another man . " She stepped closer , inches from his face . " You know , John , people have sex , married people , and for more reasons than just making babies . " Her voice rose again and she screamed at him . " They have it because it feels good and because it 's normal . " He was shaking , moving back away from her , retreating . " You 're sick , Lily . You 're not fit to be a mother . " He turned and started walking toward the back door . " I want a husband , John . I do n't want a wife . " He slammed the door and left her there in the yard . The neighbor 's dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a stick off the ground and tossed it over the fence , hearing the little dog squeal and run . Her breath was coming slower now . The tempest was over . She felt a lightness in her body , a floating sensation . She was finally going to be free . The only problem was Shana . Walking down the hall , she saw the light under her daugh-ter 's door  --  it was only ten o'clock . When she cracked the door , Shana was cramming papers from the bed back into a spiral notebook . " Can I come in for a few minutes ? " It took the younger woman only a moment to see the expression on her mother 's face and she said , " Sure . Have you  | and Dad been fighting ? I thought I heard yelling out there . " " Yes . " Lily turned her head , hoping Shana would n't see the red handprint on her face . " Can we turn out the light and get in bed the way we used to when you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicked off the light and climbed onto the side nearest the wall . " What 's going on ? " " Your dad and I are going to get a divorce , " Lily said , sniffing in the darkness and feeling the wet tears run down her face . She had felt so good in the yard ; it was what she wanted , but now she was terrified . " Things have been bad for a long time . You knew that . " " Will we be poor now ? Sally 's parents got divorced and she says they 're poor . " " I guarantee you wo n't be poor , Shana , even if I have to work an extra job . I love you ; I 'll always provide for you , and I 'll always be there for you . " Shana sat up in the bed in the dark , her voice thin and cracking . " Where will we live if you and Dad get divorced ? We wo n't be a family anymore . " Lily sat up , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll always be a family , Shana .

" She started crying . " Today . You 're doing this today . " The fact that she had started her period for the first time that day surfaced in Lily 's mind . She fell back onto the small bed . Shana would remember this day the rest of her life . " Please , Shana . Try to understand . I know it 's hard . I just ca n't live with your father anymore . I wanted to wait until you were out of high school , but ? " She cut her off . " Then why do n't you ? " " Because I ca n't take it anymore . Because I 'm too old to wait that long .

Or your dad might find another woman who will make him happy . " Shana was silent , thinking . Lily continued , " One of us has to move out . Too many bad things were said tonight . Dad wants me to move out . I have a right to stay here , Shana , and things might be different if it was just the two of us . You know , sometimes when I go to my room or stay late at the office , it 's because I do n't want to be around Dad . I mean , you stay in your room all the time and he sleeps on the couch . Try to see my side just once . " " I want to stay here with Dad . " Lily felt her heart sink . She 'd known it would be this way . She got up and turned on the light , sat on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brushed a tear off her cheek . " Why ? What is it I 've done ? What have n't I done ? Tell me . " Shana reached for a tissue off the nightstand , blowing her nose . " Dad loves me more than you do . " Resentment rose in Lily 's throat . She snapped , " That is n't true . No matter what you think , that simply is n't true . You know what it is ? It 's because he gives in to you more , waits on you more , never demands anything from you . Is n't it ? " Shana 's blue eyes roamed around the room before returning to her mother . " Maybe . " What could Lily say ? The child had answered honestly . She stood and was leaving the room when Shana spoke up . " You can sleep with me , Mom . Turn out the light . " Back in the bed , Shana moved close and put her head on Lily 's shoulder . " I do love you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know , " Lily said . " I know . "  | Clinton had called from Division 42 and told Lily that he wanted to speak with her before she left for the day ; she had agreed to wait but was anxious . John was dropping Shana off at the house she had rented in thirty minutes , and Lily had been working toward this evening all week . They had been separated for eight days , and today was the first time Shana would see the house . She had the entire evening planned . After she cooked Shana 's favorite meal , fried chicken and mashed potatoes , they would curl up together on the sofa and watch television . All the furniture had been purchased at a local antique shop , and although most of the pieces were actually inexpensive reproductions , the outcome was charming and warm . The greatest portion of the money and effort had been applied to Shana 's room , and Lily had rearranged the furniture three times until it was perfect . It contained a high four-poster bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightstand , and the bed sported a brand-new quilted pink and lavender floral-print comforter with matching curtains that Lily had hung herself .  | She had framed a lot of small snapshots of her and Shana and even her father , and placed them in tiny silver and jeweled frames on the nightstand and dresser . The drawers were full of new casual clothes , underwear , nightgowns , and multicolored socks so that Shana would not have to pack a suitcase every time she spent the night with Lily . The house had been a godsend . It had belonged to an elderly woman who had passed away , and the family wanted to rent it to someone reliable until the estate was probated . It was in an older , quiet neighborhood a few blocks from the office , and the deceased owner had been an ardent gardener . Almost every square inch of yard was planted in rose bushes and blooming flowers . Clinton came blasting into the office , out of breath , his hair standing on end . He slammed his briefcase on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem with this , I wanted to tell you face to face . I asked for dismissal on the Hernandez matter . They 're probably releasing him right now . " Lily was relieved . She was sure Clinton had asked to see her about a new development in the Stacy Jenkins case . He had interviewed the child a few days before and had gone bonkers . Learning that she was in foster care , he wanted to take her home to live with his family . Lily had put a stop to that immediately and gave him a long lecture about becoming overly involved . " Hey , earth calling Lily , " he said , seeing that her mind was far away . " You know , the prostitute case  --  the one you were so hot about . I thought you were going to ream me out for dismissing . " " So , the victim did n't show again , huh ? What was this , the third time you had continued ? " " Exactly . I would have kept the damn thing rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without a victim . . . " He paused , waiting for a reaction . " It 's fine , Clinton . At least you tried . I had a feeling it would end up like this . Give me the file and I 'll add a few  | notes regarding the dismissal just in case he surfaces in the system again . " She was already standing and took the file from his outstretched hands and loaded it into her briefcase , containing six or seven cases she planned to work on after Shana went to bed . She hurried to the door . " See you tomorrow , boss . Hey , what did you do to your arm ? That 's a pretty nasty bruise there . You mud wrestling on the side or something ? " She was beginning to like Clinton . " Oh , that , " she said , smiling , lifting her arm to inspect the bruise . " I was moving furniture in my daughter 's bedroom . " Clinton headed off in the opposite direction , and Lily made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor on the side near Richard 's office , hoping to catch a glimpse of him . He had called almost every day , and on each occasion she had found an excuse to cut the conversation short . How could she tell him that her own daughter had elected to live with her father ? Everyone knew that the children stayed with the mother unless there was a serious problem . If Shana had been a boy , the situation would have been easier to explain . But now that she was settled and Shana was right this minute on the way to her house , she felt she could finally see him . He was on the phone , in the midst of a heated conversation . Seeing Lily , he waved her in and then put the call on the speaker and walked over , kicking the door shut . " I do n't care if the guy is Jesus Christ , Madison , " he shouted . " He 's going to do jail time . Three times and you 're out , baby . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Looking Lily in the eye , he reached over and hit the off button . " How 's it going ? " she asked , standing in front of his desk . " Misdemeanors . Do you have any idea how many cases we process in this unit ? Sit , " he said , " I do n't bite . " " I ca n't , " Lily said softly . " I only have a minute . " " You have n't had a minute all week . I 'm beginning to think this whole thing between us never happened . " He leaned back in his chair and then flopped forward . His eyes softened .  | " Come home with me tonight . I ca n't get you out of my mind . " Lily 's eyes darted to the window and then back . " I ca n't . My husband and I split up . I 've just been so overwhelmed by the whole thing . Between this and the new job , I ... " " I guess I 'm supposed to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not . When can I see you ? " Her body felt hot and flushed . She wiped sweaty hands on her skirt . " Soon . I 've thought about you too . Believe me Before she knew it , he was around the desk and pulling on her hand . There was a certain spot in the offices that was blocked from view , the small space between the desk and the credenza . Once she was there , he embraced her , pressing his lips against her neck . " Stop , " she said . " I really have to go . My daughter is waiting . Please ... " He released her and leaned back against the credenza as she left . At the door she turned and looked at him . " I 'll call . Maybe tomorrow . " The front door had an overhang , and she did n't see Shana waiting there until she was halfway up the little path to the door . The smell of roses drifted through the crisp evening air . Lily smiled and rushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long have you been waiting ? " " A long time . I was afraid you were n't coming . " " I 'm sorry , honey . I had to wait for one of my attorneys , and then I had to stop off at the store . Hey , I have a surprise for you . I hope you like it . " Once inside , she took the girl by the hand , dropping both Shana 's overnight bag and her own briefcase by the front door and leading her down the hall . " This is your room now . What do you think ? " Shana tossed her long red hair and strolled confidently into the room . She was wearing a matching pants outfit that Lily had bought her only a few weeks before , pink , the top trimmed in lace . She was tall and lean , a gorgeous young woman growing  | in beauty with each day . Surveying the room with her back to Lily , she ran her hand over the top of the comforter and picked up one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them together last year at Christmas . She turned and smiled , a broad , spontaneous smile , not phony or forced . " I love it , Mom . It 's great . " Lily felt a wave of pleasure surge through her body ; light was shining in through the lovely curtains , and she felt the darkness of the past eight days disappearing . " Look in the dresser drawers . " " Oh , Mom . . . wow . . . these are great . " She was really excited now as she pulled all the new clothes out of the drawers and placed them all on the bed so she could examine them . " This is adorable . I love it . Oh , look at these . . . " She held up a pair of bikini panties that Lily had purchased at the lingerie store in the mall . All the price tags were still dangling from the items ; knowing her daughter valued things by their costs , she had left them on . Lily somehow wanted to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suffer during the divorce . She also wanted her to see this house as her home and associate it with pleasant things . Then , she hoped , Shana would spend more time with her . The clothes and room were a start . A small start , for sure , but a start . Her instincts were confirmed as she watched Shana read the numbers on the tags with a look of contentment . With clothes all over the bed and spilling onto the floor , the room now looked like her daughter 's old room , but a prettier , fresher , more feminine version . Shana 's furniture at home was older and scratched , the surfaces marked with water stains and nail polish she had spilled . Shana leaped off the bed with joy and hugged her mother . Lily buried her face in her hair and smelled the fresh scent of herbal essence shampoo . " Thanks , Mom . I love it all : the room , the clothes , the pictures . . . " She pulled away and stopped , surveying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . " " Open the door to the wardrobe , " Lily said , having antic-  | ipated this need as well . " Now , I have to start frying that chicken . I 'm starving . " Lily did n't want to take time to change clothes , so she merely tossed her jacket onto her bed as she headed for the kitchen . " Dinner in forty-five minutes . " Soon the oil was crackling hot in the skillet ; Lily was rolling chicken in flour and seasoning , having donned one of the new print aprons she had purchased . The table was set , the sliding glass door brought a breeze in through the garden , and in the background the stereo was pounding out rock music . All was right with the world . She placed the chicken in the hot oil and began peeling the potatoes . " What 'd you think ? " Shana said , modeling one of the new outfits , twirling around on the white tile floor , her long copper hair swirling around her . " It fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is my butt too big ? Does it make me look fat ? " Lily started laughing , wiping her hands on the apron and leaning back against the counter . Shana was mimicking one of her own frequent statements . " You look reed-thin and fabulous . Hey , do n't start on that fat thing . You 'll never get fat anyway , it not in your genes . " " What jeans ? Did you buy me a pair of jeans too ? " " No , silly . What I 'm talking about is genetics ; you 'll probably study it in biology next year . It relates to inheriting things from your parents . Like , I 've never really had a weight problem , nor has anyone else in the family . You 'll be just fine . " Shana moved close to her mother and looked up at her face earnestly . " Will I be as smart as you someday , then ? " - Lily saw the admiration in her eyes . This was her daughter of old . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course you 'll be as smart as me . In fact , you 'll be much smarter . You already are right now . " " I 'm not as smart as you think , Mom . Sometimes I do n't feel smart at all . I struggle so hard with my school work , and most of my friends do n't try at all and get straight A 's . You  | were always smart . That 's what Dad told me . He said you even made him feel stupid . " " Well , maybe it 's your popularity that interferes with your work . If you lived with me , I would limit your phone calls , make you discipline yourself and develop better study skills . " " Discipline myself ? That 's stupid , " she snapped . " Like I 'm really not disciplined . What does that mean ? What do you think I am anyway , a juvenile delinquent ? " Then she looked down at her tennis shoes . When she looked back up , a pronounced sadness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I ca n't leave him . Why did you leave him ? " " Maybe I need you too , Shana . Have you ever thought of that ? " Lily went to the stove and turned the heat down . She regretted that last statement . The child was stuck in between . They could n't keep pulling on her . " Okay , " she spoke up quickly , " you have a right to know what happened . I just do n't know if I can explain it to you . Dad and I are very different in the way we look at life , in the things we want from life . I worked very hard to get through law school , to make something of myself , and I work very hard today , every day . I 'm pretty good at what I do , Shana . And not only that , it 's an important job . " Lily stopped and wiped her hands on the apron . " And Dad does n't have an important job . Is that it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has an important job , but he certainly should have a full-time job . And he should appreciate my efforts . " She turned and looked at Shana . " And he was wrong in trying to cause friction between us . . . using the time he had with you , forcing me to be the bad guy all the time , the one who had to punish you , telling you I said negative things about you . " " Dad says you changed . " Lily sighed deeply , leaning back against the kitchen counter . " Maybe I did . Maybe I did . " She smiled . " Enough of that for tonight . Go change and we 'll eat . " After dinner , the dishes piled in the sink , they sat side by side on the sofa , looking through Lily 's old photo albums , most  | from the days when she was a photographic model earning her way through college . " You 're so pretty here , " Shana said , holding one of the photos up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike . Why ca n't I model ? " " You can someday , but right now you 're too young . You know how I feel about you being around a lot of strange men . And besides , you need to concentrate on your school work , decide what you want to be . Modeling is just something you do for extra money . " Lily stared out over the room , lost in the past . It was during these days that she had first met John , when she had been so young and afraid . Her grandfather 's sexual abuse had been a secret wound , something so dark and filthy that she had never told a soul . Finally , Shana tired of sitting and stood and stretched her lanky frame . While they had been chatting , she had been playing with her hair , braiding it . With no fastener it fell loose , and with a burst of energy she began jumping around and flinging her arms in the air . She was at that age when the child and the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all little girl , unaware of her actions or her body , and the next she was all woman , with pouty little poses and gestures copied from movie stars , like the hair tossing and the way she shook her slender hips from side to side as she walked . " I wan na call Dad now , " she said . Lily 's mouth fell open with disappointment . Then she turned and flashed that golden smile , lighting up the room . " The room is nice , Mom . I mean , it 's not like being at home , but it 's nice . Can I have a televi-sion ? " " No , " Lily yelled back , but she smiled . " You 're a case , Shana . A genuine case . "  | He was out . In his property he had twenty dollars , and he went to Stop ' n ' Go across from the jail and bought a six-pack of beer and two hot dogs for seventy-nine cents . When he got in line to pay , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He had watched her enough from the window . Up close , she looked different ? even from what he remembered from that earlier day in court . That day she 'd looked sterner , taller . She was a goodlooking chick , but she was older than he thought . There was one stocky old man standing in line between them . He stepped aside in order to see her better . Luck is a lady , he thought , smiling to himself and dropping his head as she paid for a bottle of Wesson oil and actually brushed up against him on the way out . He caught a whiff of her smell : clean . . . sweet . He could n't believe it . First they had released him and now he had found her only a few minutes after walking out of the jail . This was a sign , he thought , a fucking sign if he 'd ever seen one  --  right up there in league with the statue of the Ma-  | donna crying . They should put him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a fucking winner today . He watched her go through the glass doors , headed right to that same little red car he 'd watched from the windows of the jail . " Shit , " he said out loud , just as the man in front of him was paying for a pack of smokes . He slammed his beer and dogs down on the counter and ripped out his twenty , his eyes darting back and forth to the parking lot . Change in hand , he turned , thinking she would be gone by now . But no , he chuckled , she was digging in that dumb-shit purse for her keys , just as she had in the parking lot . Stupid bitch , he thought . Stupid hot-shot D.A . whore . Once she was inside the car , he bolted through the doors , jumped in his car , and followed her . Did she look in her rearview mirror ? Not once . Fucking women . Sometimes he thought they deserved everything they got just because they were so fucking stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in prisons , locking them away like animals in the zoo . He could outsmart her with both hands tied behind his back . He stayed several car lengths behind her as she drove through the rush-hour traffic . He 'd have never thought his luck would be this good . She was fucking pulling into a driveway and parking her car , getting out and walking to the front door . Once she got near the doorway , he could n't see her . Should steal her car too , he thought  --  probably left the keys right in the ignition . Might have a husband in there . Might have a fucking gun or something . Might be just the lady . Parked a block from her house , he ate the rubbery hot dogs and slugged down two or three cans of the beer . Loaf  --  they served this thing they called loaf all the time in the jail . Tried to call the shit meat loaf , but everyone knew there was no meat in it . Willie had told him that they served it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure could n't kill someone with a fucking loaf , but a chicken bone , that might work . As soon as he thought of Willie , the scene at the jail with  | the biker and his little playmate returned to his mind . The biker 's cocksucker lady had touched his balls . He rolled down the window and spat . It made him want to puke . And the tattooed motherfucker had called him an Oxnard cockroach . This bitch had caused that , he thought , staring at the front of the house . Never would have happened except for her . He felt the anger rise inside of him . Willie had said other things . Willie had seen his back . " Fuck . . . fuck . . . fuck , " he screamed . He grabbed the empty beer cans and started throwing them at the windshield of the car . One popped back and hit him in the face . His stomach was twisting . Snakes  --  it felt like snakes in there  --  a pit of snakes crawling in circles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat him with  --  big , skinny sticks torn from the tree out back . First it was the closet , the dark , stinking closet . He sat in there for hours and cried and cried , beating the door until his hands were bloody and raw . But when she opened the door , it was worse because she had the switches . Over the commode . . . she made him bend over the fucking open , reeking john with his shirt off . And she whipped him and whipped him , screaming that she would n't stop until he quit crying . But she was a liar . Even when he quit crying , she never stopped . She did n't stop until blood dripped from his back onto the filthy , cracked linoleum . Then she made him mop it up , scrub and scrub until it was all gone . He could still smell the awful stuff she put on her hair . The stuff to make it red  --  whore 's red . It smelled so awful that his eyes would burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to her hips  --  before the switches and the beatings . He used to brush it and braid it for her , feel it sliding through his fingers like silk . He 'd stand behind her on a stool and gather it gently in his hands like a horse 's tail . Then he 'd close his knees on it and hold it there while he picked up each strand to braid . After she made her hair red , she started staying out all night and sleeping all day . She stopped making them food . Sometimes she 'd walk in the door with a sack and they thought  | it was food , but it was n't . It was a bottle of booze . She 'd throw a few dollar bills on the table and leave every night . He 'd walk alone to the store and try to buy enough for them all to eat , but he never had enough money . He had to steal . He turned on the car radio . Like dessert , he 'd saved the best for last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hand reached under there but could n't find it . Starting to panic , he reached farther and then he felt it : the hunting knife . Just the feel of the cold metal made his dick get hard , and he rubbed it back and forth with his hand , thinking what he was going to do to the fucking whore in the house . Adrenaline surged through his body and he laughed . He could wait until dark ? he was used to waiting . He 'd wait until he thought it was safe , and then he would get out and walk her house , try to figure who was inside . Then he 'd come back and sleep awhile until it was right . He always knew when it was right . Tonight it was going to be right .  | She glanced at the bedside clock . It was almost eleven o'clock . Lily started to retrieve her briefcase from the living room to go over a few cases , but she could n't muster up the energy and instead removed her clothing and climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost euphoric knowing her daughter was asleep in the new fourposter bed across the hall and the evening had gone so well , she turned off the light . It then dawned on her that she had not checked the doors in the little house , a chore John had always handled . With her terrycloth robe wrapped loosely around her , she padded barefoot in the dark , deciding to check the kitchen door first . It was a quiet neighborhood : no cars , no barking dogs , just blissful stillness . Entering the kitchen , she saw the drapes billowing in the slight breeze , being sucked through the open sliding glass door . She chastised herself for not locking it but felt the area was so safe , it probably was n't even necessary . As she pushed the drapes aside and started pulling the door in the track , a funny  | feeling came over her , a sense of something amiss . Holding her breath in order to hear better , she heard a squeak , like the sound a basketball player 's sneakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the noise behind her , her heart beating so fast it hurt , her robe pushed up from the floor over her face and head with lightning speed . As she struggled to scream and free herself , her feet slid out from under her but she did not fall . She was being carried in a suffocating embrace . What must be an arm was placed directly over her mouth . Trying to sink her teeth into the arm , she bit a mouthful of terrycloth instead . She was nude from the waist down and felt the cold night air against her lower body . Her bladder emptied , splashing against the tile floor . She tried to move her arms , but they were trapped across her chest inside the robe . Kicking out furiously , her foot connected with what must be a kitchen chair , and it screeched across the floor , landing with a loud thud against the wall . The backs of her calves and her feet were burning , and she knew she was being dragged down the hall  --  toward where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , no , Shana . The only sound she emitted was a muffled , inhuman groan of sheer agony coming from her stomach through her vocal cords to her nasal passages . Her mouth would not move . Her feet struck something . The wall ? No longer kicking  --  no longer struggling , she was praying : " ... as I walk through the Valley of Death . . . " She could n't remember the words . Flashes of the past were meshed with the present . Not Shana , not her child  --  she had to protect her child . " Mom . " She heard her voice , first questioning and childlike and then the terror of her sickening high-pitched scream reverberated in Lily 's head . She heard something heavy crash into the wall , body against body , the sound heard on a football field when the players collided . He had her . He had her daughter . He had them both . In another moment they were on the bed in Lily 's bedroom . When he removed his arm , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light from the bathroom . Shana was next to her and he was over them both . Light reflected off the steel of the knife he held only inches from Lily 's throat . His other hand was on Shana 's neck . Lily grabbed his arm , and with the abnormal strength of terror she almost succeeded in twisting his arm backward , turning the knife toward him , seeing in her mind the blade entering his body where his heart beat . But he was too strong and with eyes wild with excitement , darting back and forth , his tongue protruding from his mouth , he forced the blade sideways into her open mouth , the sharp edges nicking the tender edges of her lips . She bit down on the blade with her teeth , her tongue touching something crusty and vile . His face was only inches away , his breath rancid with beer . " Taste it , " he said , a look of pleasure on his face . " It 's her blood . Lick it with your tongue . Lick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Removing the knife from Lily 's mouth and placing it back at her throat , he moved his hand from Shana 's neck and shoved her gown up , exposing her budding breasts and her new bikini panties . Shana desperately tried to push the gown down to cover herself , turning pleading eyes to Lily . " No , " she cried . " Stop him , Mommy . Please make him stop . " He thrust his fingers around her neck . She choked and gurgling sounds came from her throat , a trickle of saliva ran from the corner of her mouth . Her eyes were glazed . " Be calm , Shana . Do n't fight . Do what he says . Everything is going to be okay . Please , baby , listen to me . " Lily 's voice was forced control . " Let her go . I 'll give you the best fuck you ever had . I 'll do anything . " " That 's it , Momma . You tell her . Tell her how fucking good it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were uttered through clenched teeth . He had one knee between Shana 's legs , forcing them open , and the other knee between Lily 's , touching her genitals . " Unzip me , " he ordered Shana . Shana 's terrified eyes again made contact with her mother 's . " Do it , Shana , " she said , watching while her child 's thin , trem-  | bling arm reached for his crotch , unable to grasp the small end of the zipper . He raised his body up somewhat , but the crusty knife remained near Lily 's throat . " Do it for her , Momma , " he said , shifting the knife to his other hand and positioning the point on Shana 's navel . " Teach her how to take care of a man . " Lily had to distract him , somehow get him away from Shana . She had to find a way to get the knife . Quickly unzipping him and removing his penis , she placed it in her mouth , the ragged edges of the zipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor , but he was becoming erect and moaning , throwing his head back , moving the knife away from Shana 's body . He grabbed a handful of her hair and jerked her head back . He fell on top of Lily , looking straight into her eyes and relishing the fear he saw reflected there . Something struck her chest , then her chin . It was a gold cross with a crucified Christ dangling from his neck . Suddenly he thrust himself up . " No , I want her , Momma . I do n't wan na whore , a fucking old redheaded whore . " Once again he expertly tossed the knife from one hand to the other and placed it again at Lily 's throat . " Watch , Momma , watch or I 'll gut her . " With one vicious yank Shana 's underpants were torn off and tossed aside . Her body bounced up on the bed and then fell under the weight of him . He forced himself inside her and Shana screamed in pain . Lily had never felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years past . There was no God . She knew it now . No reason to pray . She wished that he would just cut her throat and end it all . " Oh , Mommy . Oh , Mommy , " Shana gasped . Lily found her hand beside her and squeezed it tightly . It was cold and clammy . " Hold on , baby . Close your eyes and make believe you are far away . Hold on . " A loud siren wailed in the street somewhere . He jumped and sprang from the bed . " The neighbors heard and called the police , " Lily said , hearing the sound growing nearer and  | nearer . " They 're going to shoot you , kill you . " He was directly under the light emanating from the bathroom , his red sweatshirt and face completely outlined and visible as he frantically tried to snap his jeans . Lily sat up in the bed and screamed , in raw panic and fury , " If they do n't shoot you , I 'll kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few blocks away . In seconds he was gone . She held her daughter tightly in her arms , stroking her hair , softly whispering in her ear . " It 's over , baby , he 's gone . No one is going to hurt you ever again . It 's over . " The shrill of the siren was becoming distant , fading from earshot . No one had called the police . Their agony had gone unnoticed . Time stood still as she rocked her daughter in her arms and listened to her pitiful , wracking sobs . A million things were racing through her mind . Two or three times she tried to wrench herself away and call the police . Shana was holding on so tightly , though , that she stopped . He was long gone anyway by now , lost in the night . Every sordid detail replayed itself in her mind . A hard ball of rage was forming in her stomach and spilling bile into her mouth . " Shana , darling , I 'm going to get up now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a washcloth for you from the bathroom , and then I 'm going to call the police and your father . " Lily inched away and pulled her robe back over her shoulders , tying the sash loosely around her waist . The rage was somehow calming her , moving her around like a machine with a great churning engine . " No , " Shana said forcefully in a voice Lily had never heard . " You ca n't tell Dad what he did to me . " She reached out and grabbed the edge of Lily 's robe as she tried to get up , causing it to fall open and expose her nakedness . She retied it again . " You ca n't tell anyone . " The face and voice were a child 's , but the eyes were a woman 's . She would never be a child again , never see the world as a safe place without fear . Lily placed a hand to her mouth , biting her knuckle , stifling a scream that welled up inside her .  | In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shana , she held her and rocked her , comforting the child she had been . " We must call the police . We must call Daddy . " " No , " she screamed again . " I think I 'm going to be sick . " Shana ran to the bathroom . She threw up on the tile floor before she got to the commode . Lily dropped to the floor with her and wiped her face with cold towels . She went to the medicine cabinet and found the bottle of Valium a doctor had recently prescribed for her insomnia . Her hands were shaking as she poured two pills out , one for her and one for Shana . " Take this , " she said , handing her the pill with a paper Dixie cup of water . " It will relax you . " Shana swallowed the pill , watched with round eyes as her mother tossed one into her own mouth . She let Lily help her back to the bed . Once again she held her in her arms . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Leave this house . I wo n't call the police , but we are going to tell Daddy . We have no choice , Shana . " Lily knew exactly what she would be subjecting her daughter to if she reported the crime . The police would stay for hours , forcing them to relive the nightmare , making every detail of it live forever in their minds . Then the hospital and the medical  --  legal exam . They would probe Shana 's ravaged body and comb her pubic hairs looking for evidence . They would swab their mouths . If they apprehended him , months and months of testimony and court appearances would consume their lives . Shana would have to sit on the witness stand and repeat the sordid details of this night in lurid detail to a roomful of strangers . She would have to rehearse her testimony with the prosecuting attorney like lines in a play . In that room , breathing the same air , he would also sit . Then the ordeal would become known . Even some kid at school might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most despicable thought of all , a truth that Lily alone was far too aware of , was the fact that after all they had suffered , would suffer , while the nightmares were still the sweat-  | ing , waking , screaming kind , before they could even begin to resume normal life , he would be free again . The term for aggravated rape was only eight years , out in four . He would even receive credit for time served during and prior to the trial so that by the time he was on the bus to prison , his countdown to freedom might amount to only three years . No , she thought , he could receive a consecutive sentence for the oral copulation , amounting to a few more years . It was not enough . It could never be enough . And she felt certain he had committed other vicious crimes . She recalled the taste of dried , old blood on the knife . Possibly even murder . This crime was a murder : the annihilation of innocence . She also had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality that although she could prosecute rape cases , she could never try them without bias as a superior court judge . A door was closing in her face . Thought by thought , she was getting further away from reporting this to the authorities . His face kept reappearing before her , and somewhere in the far reaches of her mind , she knew she had seen him before . Her memory of the attack crowded out the past , and she was no longer able to distinguish reality from imagination . But that face ... Shana had calmed somewhat ; the drug was taking effect . Moving slowly away , Lily called John on the bedside phone . He was in a deep sleep when she awoke him , his answer a muffled and annoyed " Hello " as if he was expecting a wrong number . " John , you have to come over here now . " She spoke softly and rapidly . " Something has happened . " " My God , what time is it ? Is Shana sick ? " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions until you get here . Shana is right beside me . " Her voice started to crack . She did n't know how much longer she could maintain her composure . " Please come . We need you . " She hung up and looked at the clock  --  only one o'clock . A mere two hours to destroy their lives and take away the hap-  | piness they were finally finding in each other . Her thoughts turned to John and what this would do to him . Shana was his life , his shining star , his protected and sheltered baby girl . When Shana was born , he had shoved Lily away and centered all his affection on the child : holding her , stroking her , kissing her when he no longer kissed his wife . Starting to tremble , Lily hugged herself . She had to be strong . It seemed like only minutes passed before John arrived . Time had been standing still , hanging over them like a dark storm cloud , refusing to move , the unleashed downpour contained and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What in the hell is going on here ? The front door is wide open . " His tone was accusing , demanding , and it was vented at Lily . Shana 's muscles had began to relax in Lily 's arms , and her breathing was shallow , her body too still . " Daddy , " she said , hearing his voice , crying out to him . " Oh , Daddy . " He ran to her side of the bed and Lily released her . As John engulfed her in his large arms , she pressed her body to his chest , sobbing . " Oh , Daddy . " He looked at Lily , his dark eyes full of fury , but in their depths , fear was rising . " What happened ? " he shouted . " Tell me what happened here tonight . " " Shana , Daddy and I are going to go in the other room and talk , " Lily said gently . " You 'll hear us talking and know we are there . We 'll only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned for John to follow . The Valium had calmed her somewhat and she told John what had happened . It was an emotionless recitation of facts . If she allowed one tear to fall , the floodgates would open . They were sitting on the newly purchased sofa with the amber light from a Tiffany lamp creating an almost surreal atmosphere . The photo albums were still open on the floor . He leaned up close and with his fingers touched the small cuts at the side of her mouth , but it was not a gesture of concern or affection . It was more like reflex , confirmation of the reality of what she  | was saying . His eyes clearly said that she was responsible , no matter what reason predicated . She should have found the strength to stop him . That 's the way he saw her , Lily thought . A tower of strength , invincible . Then he sobbed , his masculine body wracked with pain , that unfamiliar and pitiful sound that signified a grown man crying like a child . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite simply heartbroken . His sorrow left no room for rage . " Well , do you want to call the police ? You 're her father and I ca n't make this decision without you , " she said . " It 's not irreversible . We can always file a report later if we change our minds . " As she spoke , her eyes darted to the kitchen , wondering about evidence , fingerprints on the door . " No , I agree with you . It would only make it worse for her , " he finally replied . Tears were still streaming down his face , and he wiped them away with the back of his hand . " Would they catch the bastard if we reported it ? " " How the hell do I know , John ? No one knows . We do n't have a vehicle description . " She cursed herself for not running after him , for staying with Shana . " Maybe we 're doing the wrong thing , for chrissake , by not reporting it . God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so muddled , full of barely suppressed rage . Memories of the past and years of untold secrets were tainting her reason . Something inside her was diving , sinking , twisting . She had to stop it . She had to rewind the tape . Erase it . John 's voice sounded distant . She stared at him and tried to focus . " I want to take Shana home , take her away from this place . " His voice was a choked whimper . " I do n't know or care about anything else . I just want to take care of my child . " " I know , " she shouted , and then lowered her voice so that Shana would not hear , " and she 's our child , not yours . Do n't you think I want to take care of her ? I do n't want her to suffer . I could n't stop this . I tried , but I can stop it now . I gave her  | a sedative . Let 's just bundle her up and take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stood and then stopped dead in his tracks , staring at her . A look of utter horror shot from his ravaged eyes . He had not combed his hair over his bald spot , and a long strand dangled over by his temple . He looked so old , so haggard . " Could she get pregnant ? My baby , my little baby . " She started to reply but found herself disgusted by his weakness ; it was this that had caused her to lose respect for him over the years . As she had forced herself to overcome the past , to confront the violence of the world they lived in , he had lived in a fantasy world that did n't exist . Why could n't he make the decisions that had to be made for once in their life ? She could n't stop herself from thinking of Richard , wishing he was there instead of John . For the first time she had reached for happiness , touched the soft edge of pleasure . Pleasure , she thought . That man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror . He had found pleasure in their degradation . Just as her grandfather had found pleasure in the forbidden recesses of her young body . " He did n't ejaculate . The sirens scared him away . We can take her to the doctor tomorrow , and they 'll give her antibiotics for possible disease and check her . There 's a slim chance she could get pregnant from pre-emission sperm . We 'll just have to pray . " " Will she ever get over this , Lily ? Will our little girl ever be the same ? " " With you and I beside her and all the love and help we can give her , I know she will . I pray to God she will . " As she said the stock comforting words she had said to dozens of victims , their worthlessness struck home . Shana was strong , had been strong . Lily had tried to make her strong , refusing to baby her and shelter her as John had . And if they did n't drag it on and on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . Like her own bad dreams , and  | she had made it . The only alternative was to become a hopeless cripple , and no child of hers would fall into this abyss . She would not allow it . After they wrapped Shana in the new comforter off her bed , John led her to the door . She turned and looked at Lily , and their eye contact locked and lingered . Lily had wanted to be her friend and confidante , to guide her without her father 's intervention . Instead they had witnessed hell together , forming a bond , but one forged in terror . " You go home and go to sleep . Daddy will sleep on the floor next to you . " She embraced her . " I 'll be there in the morning when you wake up . " " Will he come back , Mom ? " " No , Shana , he 'll never come back . I 'll move out of this house tomorrow . We 'll never come here again . Soon we 'll both forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie .  | Once they had gone , Lily hurriedly started throwing things in a small duffel bag . The house was dead quiet again , that ominous stillness like before , and she was shaking . The memory of the attacker 's face in the last few minutes before he had left kept flashing in her mind , and each time she dropped what she was doing and stood there , frozen in thought , trying to put her finger on what it was that she associated with his face . Suddenly the face appeared , but not as she remembered it . It appeared in a mug shot photo . She ran to the living room , tripping and falling on the edge of her robe , soggy and reeking from Shana 's vomit . From her position on the floor , she saw her briefcase and crawled the rest of the way on her hands and knees . Her fingers trembled as she dialed the combination lock . On the third try it clicked open . She threw all the files on the floor and frantically searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went flying across the carpet . Suddenly it was in her hands and she was looking at his face . He was the same man who had attempted to rape the  | prostitute . Clinton 's case that he had dismissed today . The man was even wearing the same red sweatshirt . He had been arrested and photographed in it . Photographed with that smug smile . They must have released him about the time she left the building , giving him back his original clothes with the rest of his property . Someone either picked him up or dropped off his car . He must have followed her from the complex . There was no doubt in her mind as she studied the hated image in her hands . No doubt at all . It was him . Her breath was coming fast now , catching and rattling in her throat . Whatever effects the Valium had were gone . Adrenaline was pumping through her veins . She rapidly sorted through the pages of the file to the police report . There it was : his address . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxnard . His name was Bobby Hernandez and although Hispanic , he had listed his place of birth as Fresno , California . Lily tore the sheet with his address from the file and placed it in the pocket of her robe . She went into the bedroom and threw on a pair of Levi 's and a sweater , transferring the address to the jeans . She dug into the back of the closet until she found her furlined winter hiking boots . John had insisted that she remove every single item that belonged to her from the house when she moved , as though he wanted to erase her from his life , everything except the furniture . That he wanted to keep . In the same box was a blue knit ski cap . She placed it on her head and stuffed her hair inside it . She headed for the garage . Back in the corner , behind three or four boxes was her father 's shotgun , a twelve-gauge Browning semi-automatic , the one he had used to hunt deer , one of the curious items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given Lily his cast-iron barbecue , one Cross pen , and his shotgun . Nothing more . In the stillness of the garage , as her hands touched the barrel of the gun , Lily felt his presence beside her and heard his voice . " Good shot , Lily girl . Good as any boy could make , " he would say with his booming , gruff voice on the Saturday  | afternoon he had taken her to shoot tin cans lined up on a tree stump . He had wanted a son . She no longer dreamed of frilly dresses and bows for her hair . By the time her grandfather had died , when she was thirteen , Lily had wanted exactly the same thing as her father . Spotting the small box containing the green slugs , she again heard his voice , right there next to her , clear and distinct . " These are called rifled slugs , Lily girl . " She loaded them into the chamber and crammed several more into the tight pocket of her jeans . " These will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can bet on that . You shoot something with this baby and it 's gon na stop . " She did not falter for a moment , his voice guiding her , pushing her on . " Once you get your sights on them and decide to shoot , shoot . You ca n't wait or you 'll miss . " He had taken her on a deer-hunting trip , proud of his daughter , wanting his hunting buddies with sons to see what a good marksman she had become . " It 's meat , honey , " he said , speaking to her in the car on the drive down . " Ven-ison . " Later , in the woods , she had the shot , the gentle , beautiful animal in her sights , but she had hesitated , teeth clenched , hands sweating , unable to pull the trigger . He was disappointed . She had let him down . She vowed she would never miss again . As she left the garage , shotgun muzzle down in her arms , her footsteps echoed even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet . She felt heavy , rooted to the ground with resolve , walking in another dimension , no longer alone in her body . The phone rang like a shrill bell , invasive , unwelcome , but a signal , a signal to begin . It was John . " Shana 's asleep . I 'm worried about you . Are you coming over ? " " I 'll be there in a few hours . Do n't worry . I ca n't sleep now anyway . I want to calm down and take a bath . He 's not coming back here tonight . Just worry about Shana . " Do what you do best , she thought without contempt , accepting her role , and I 'll do what has to be done .  | She started to lock the front door and leave and then thought of something , returning to the kitchen . Rummaging through the drawers , her fingers seized a black Magic Marker , the one she had used to label the moving crates . She shoved it into her other pocket and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A streetlight reflected half moons of light on the manicured green yards . She had only briefly seen the neighbors on either side the day she moved into the house . They were both elderly couples and she had heard their televisions blasting early on in the evening . The sounds that had earlier pierced the night had fallen on deaf ears . The block looked quiet and peaceful , as if nothing had ever happened , yet the stillness was audible now , a sound of its own . She crouched at the rear of her car and began marking the license plate . The plate read FP0322 . With the marker she altered it to read EB0822 . It was a small change , but it was the best she could do . She threw the shotgun in the backseat , thought of covering it , and then decided that it did n't matter . The rage was an unseen inferno , burning all around her , blinding her , engulfing her , pushing her on . She kept seeing him over Shana , the knife at her navel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She drove toward Oxnard . The streets were quiet . She rolled the window down and let the night air blow in her face . As she passed the farming area of Oxnard , the smell of fertilizer reminded her of his rancid odor . She tasted his vile penis in her mouth  --  she spat out the window . The edges of her mouth stung from the razor-sharp nicks of the knife . The thought of where that knife had been and the dried matter she 'd tasted made her force the thought from her mind to keep from vomiting . Slowly she drove down the dark streets , passing from one streetlight to another , one stop sign , another traffic signal changing from red to green to yellow and back again . In her mind they were like runway lights , illuminating her descent  | into Hell . Cars sped past her now and then . Couples coming home from parties , dates , bars ; lovers crawling out of beds and returning to other beds . At one red light she looked into the car next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver , a middle-aged woman with tired , defeated eyes in a lined face . Lily thought she might be a late-shift waitress from an establishment like Denny 's , going home to a little apartment somewhere . Maybe she feared someone would be waiting to jump out and attack her . " Be careful , " Lily told her as their cars moved into the intersection . " You could be next . " She was trying to formulate a plan . It did n't take her long to find the house . The street was a major thoroughfare in Oxnard and she simply followed the numbers . The area was called Colonia . She knew it well , for it was infested with drug dealing and crime . His house was one in a row of tiny stucco houses . Across the street was a vacant lot . The yard was overgrown with weeds , dry and cracking from lack of water . On the front porch was an old refrigerator with a big heavy-link chain and padlock . They had probably been cited by the police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the driveway was a dusty black older-model Plymouth and a partially primered brown Ford pickup . In the attempted rape and kidnap , he had driven a van and there was no van . The screen on the front door hung haphazardly on its hinges . One window was boarded up with no glass . The other was open yet covered by curtains . The house was dark . Like a burglar she cased the area , noting that the nearest streetlight was a block away on the corner . She had driven here with intent , her loaded shotgun in the backseat , but with no definite plan . She knew she could n't enter his house and shoot him . That would be suicide . And she had no way of knowing for certain that he was actually inside . There was only one way : wait for him to come out . It could be broad daylight and dozens of people might be milling about on the street . Some of these houses had five or six families living together . She looked at the cars parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hondas were not a common mode of transportation in Colonia . Turning back toward the field she had passed earlier , she steered the car onto a dirt road , pressing down on the accelerator and flooring it . The car had been washed only a few days before . It was now absorbing the dust she was churning up with her tires . She parked by the road , with crops planted as far as she could see on either side . Taking the shotgun from the backseat , she pointed into the fields and fired it . The blast shattered the stillness of the night , and the butt of the gun smashed into her shoulder . Her father had been dead for ten years . She wanted to be certain her weapon of death would perform . Quickly throwing it in the backseat , she spun out and headed back onto the main road , making her way under the freeway and traveling into the safer , well-lit streets of Ventura . She passed the government center complex and pulled into the parking lot . Lights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows were dark . Her eyes darted to those windows and she was instantly filled with visions of him watching her , watching as she fumbled with her keys as she always did , never having them ready in her hand , always reckless of her own safety , thinking she was impervious , invincible , spending so much time among criminals and crime that she had felt like someone watching it all from above , protected and safe . She thought of how her little red car had stood alone so many nights in the parking lot . A force more powerful than rage seeped into her mind : guilt . By her actions she had caused this to happen to her daughter . It had started with the night she had slept with Richard , a married woman out fucking around while her child and husband were home . But no , John had not been home . He had been lurking in the shadows , spying on her , waiting to catch her at something he had repeatedly and wrongfully accused her of dozens of times through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hated him for his distrust and even threatened to go out and cheat on him purposely because he did n't believe her no  | matter what she did or said . From the onset of their marriage , in whispered words from the soul , he had shown her again and again his fear that he would someday lose her . He had also said that she did not love him , had never loved him , had only sought refuge in their marriage . She had heard the words so many times over the years that she finally believed him . Maybe he was right . She had shunned the social scene in college , the aggressive , egotistical young men who had asked her out . She had selected only the shy , bookish types to date and ended the relationships before they had a chance to develop . Their meeting had been chance , in a drugstore with a small lunch counter . He lied , overinflating his job and income at a personnel agency , courting her with flowers and cards . But it was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel safe , protected . " Men will just use you as a receptacle , " he had told her . " They think women are just for sex . " He said he wanted to make love to her when she was his wife , the future mother of his unborn children , the " way it 's supposed to be . In time , Lily initiated the sex between them , found her body seeking it . The more she wanted , the less he wanted her . It began after Shana was born and gradually got more pronounced , particularly the last year or so . Finally she had stopped wanting . She circled the parking lot and then left , her hands firmly planted on the steering wheel , her back rigid . The darkness was slowly changing into the overcast gray of a southern California morning . She could hear birds in the trees as she passed the parkway leading to Oxnard . Here and there , the world was awakening . She had to go to the bathroom but refused to stop . She willed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up to a stoplight and glanced in the rearview minor , she caught sight of her image . Her face was ashen . Her eyes bloodshot . She looked old and tired in the blue knit cap , pulled low on her forehead . As she realized that the stench of him still clung to her body and had now grotesquely blended with her own de-  | veloping body odor , a wave of nausea assaulted her . She bit down on the inside of her mouth , tasting her own blood . Slowly guiding the Honda onto his street , she saw a dark green van parked at the curb , its rear doors open . Her eyes turned at once to the shotgun in the backseat while her pulse raced and her stomach churned . Eyes back to the street , she saw no movement . A muted radio played from an open window , the words probably Spanish . She strained to pinpoint the sound . Pulling to the curb five or six houses away , hands locked and sweating on the cool steering wheel , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her denim-clad thighs before she reached for the shotgun and transferred it to the front seat , the muzzle pointed at the floorboard . When a dog barked somewhere , she jumped and took her foot off the brake . The car was still in drive , engine running ; it jerked forward . After staring so hard at the front of his house that her vision had blurred , she saw a distinct flash of red . She floored the Honda and covered the distance between the houses in seconds . Slamming both feet on the brake , she threw the gear shift into park without thinking and grabbed the shotgun . The sound of the barrel as it struck the top of her car was earsplitting in the morning silence . He was exiting the house , halfway down the curb , headed toward the van . He saw her and stopped abruptly , planting both his feet firmly on the ground . On his face was a look of shock and confusion . Inside that second , reason flickered behind the eyes she lowered to the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinpoint of light before blindness . Her body moved back inches , but the light was gone , the sight a framed portrait of red fabric pulsating with the beat of his heart . Her nostrils burned with Old Spice after-shave . Sandpaper fingers dug into her vagina . The man in front of her was no longer the man who had raped her daughter , he was the old puppeteer , her grandfather . She fired .  | The impact knocked him off his feet . His hands and legs flew in the air . The green slug ejected onto the street . The explosion reverberated inside her head . A gaping hole appeared in the center of the red sweatshirt , spewing forth blood . She was drowning in a frothy sea of red blood : Shana 's blood , virginal blood , sacrificial blood . Her throat constricted , mucus dripped from her nose , and once again the alien , detached finger squeezed the trigger . The slug hit near his shoulder , severing his arm . Her knees buckled beneath her . The shotgun fell butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the soft flesh of her chin , stopping her . Moving her head , she vomited chunks of chicken onto the black asphalt , seeing pieces of flesh boiling . She pulled herself into the open door to the car , her arms locked around the shotgun . Everything was moving , shaking , bleeding , screaming . She saw objects flying through the air , trapping her inside the core of horror . Move , she ordered her body , still frozen . Move . She grabbed the steering wheel , releasing the shotgun . Do n't look . Drive . Her foot responded and the car surged forward . The intersection was there in a second . Turn . Breathe . Turn . Drive . She had not killed a human being . Turn . Drive . Turn . The sun was shining , but she saw only a dark tunnel in front of her . She knew she was in Hell and there was no way out . " Please , God , " she prayed . " In the name of the Father , the Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Show me the way out . " Her body was like ice , but she was dripping with sweat . The sign read Alameda Street . The sun was blazing , the streets teeming with activity . Seeing the stop sign , she braked , waiting while three school children crossed . She had been driving aimlessly for at least an hour . The shotgun , now on the floorboard , had rolled to a resting place against her feet . She kicked it back and continued . It was as if she could see herself from a position outside her body . Somehow she no longer felt connected . The houses  | were larger and the yards well tended . She was no longer in Colonia . In her mind she could visualize the crime scene : the police cars with their lights flashing , the ambulance and paramedics , the crowd of onlookers being shoved back by the police . If he had survived , he would have been transported to the nearest hospital , and the emergency-room staff would be trying to stop the bleeding , assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be in surgery , a dedicated physician trying to save his life . What she willed herself to see was his disgusting , inhuman body beneath a coarse dark blanket , lifeless . Finding a major cross street , she made her way to the freeway and headed home . To Shana , she thought , she had to get to Shana . " He 'll never hurt you again , baby . He 'll never hurt anyone again , " she whispered . As the words left her mouth , the voice she heard was not her own . It was her moth-er 's voice , saying the words she 'd yearned to hear as a child , telling her that her grandfather 's perverted abuse of her body was over . Those words had never been spoken . Only his death had freed her . She plucked the knit ski cap from her head and tossed it out the open window as she entered the on-ramp to Camarillo . She felt remarkably calm and controlled , both full and empty , horrified but at peace . The rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and propelled toward its target , locked inside the green slug . The evil had returned to the person who had unleashed it . Instead of turning left , in the direction of her house , she turned right . Her destination was an old church whose property included a steep slope planted heavily with avocado trees . She saw it every day on her way to work . The parking lot was deserted . Mature trees blocked anyone from seeing it from nearby streets . Exiting the Honda with the shotgun , she wiped it with the tail of her shirt and held it in the fabric until she released it to tumble down the embankment . As her eyes  | tracked it , she said , " I killed a mad dog today , Dad . You would have been proud . " Turning onto her street , her eyes scanned the gauges on the dash . The little needle on the gasoline gauge was not even a fraction above , it was locked on " E. " A second later she saw the police car parked in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas fumes alone as Lily approached her driveway , she knew she had no option but to enter the house and confront the police . She hit the garagedoor opener and pulled the Honda alongside John 's white Jeep Cherokee . As she let her head fall against the steering wheel , the engine still running , the garage door closed , her thoughts turned to asphyxiation . As her mind struggled toward lucidity , a capsized boat trying to right itself , she reached for the strength of rage and her earlier conviction , and knew it was gone . She was naked and exposed , fully aware of what she had done , face to face with the horror . Perhaps there was just enough gas left , lingering lethally in the tank , and some slim chance that whoever was inside could not hear the engine running before she turned blue and it was all over . She quickly turned the key off . Killing herself would only inflict more agony on Shana . How had they found her ? Linked her to the crime in only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate through the Department of Motor Vehicles , for she had  | altered it . Even if he had lived and recognized her in her blue knit cap ? Maybe he had seen the Honda ? That 's it . He had followed her , of course . He might not know her name , but he knew where she lived . Here again , it did n't play . The house was a rental and would take more than a few hours to track , and she truly doubted that he  --  in what had to have been a dying statement  --  remembered the street and number . Her life was over . She would be imprisoned and disbarred . There was no defense for the crime she had committed . No matter what he had done to her and Shana , she had not shot him in self-defense ; she had tracked him down and assassinated him . She thought of defenses : diminished capacity , temporary insanity . Did she know her actions were wrong at the time ? Was she cognizant of their wrongfulness ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car door handle took all the strength and courage Lily had . She almost fell to the garage floor when the door swung open , for her fingers were locked on the handle . John opened the door to the garage just as she reached the first of the four steps leading to the house . " Where in God 's name have you been ? I was panicked . I kept calling the house . Then I dozed off until about six . You still were n't here , so I called the police . " He paused , rubbing one hand across his brow . " I guess you saw the police car . " When he continued , it was in a tentative , uncertain voice . " I told them everything . They 're talking to Shana in the den now . " Lily 's hand flew instinctively to her neck ; the noose she had been hanging from had been cut , but only for the moment . " What did you tell them ? You mean , about the rape ? You decided we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said we should have reported it last night . They might have caught him in the area , somewhere near your house . With you being a D.A . and everything , they found it hard to understand why you did n't report it . " There was more confidence in his voice now , his actions having the support of  | the police officers . He turned and entered the house , through the door leading to the kitchen . The den opened off the same area . Lily stepped inside and took in the scene . There were two uniformed officers : a female sitting on the beige leather sofa next to Shana , the male standing back near the kitchen bar . Although she knew a lot of police officers , she had never seen these two . All eyes in the room turned toward her , yet she spoke as if she were carrying on a private conversation with John , her voice low . " I 'm sorry I worried you , " she said , looking down at the floor and then back again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on the freeway to come home right after we talked and then realized I was halfway to L.A. I got off on some side street and got lost . By the time I found my way back to the freeway , I was stuck in rush-hour traffic . " Feeling the eyes on her , Lily threw her arms around John 's neck in an awkward embrace , then stepped back . " I started to call , but I was afraid to get out of the car . It was a bad neighborhood . And I was afraid to wake you and Shana . " She acknowledged the officers ' presence with a nod and hurried to Shana 's side . She was pale , glassy-eyed , and dark circles were visible under her eyes . Only her head protruded from the blanket she was wrapped in . Choking noises rose from her throat as Lily put her arms around her and guided her head to her shoulder . Shana moved her body to get as close to her mother as possible , trying to wedge her head under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The female officer was blond , a bit stocky for her frame , but the uniform added bulk , and she wore her hair in a knot at the base of her neck . Her eyes were hazel and reflected concern and kindness , but her face was a practiced mask of authority . " I 'm Officer Talkington , Mrs. Forrester , and this is Officer Travis . " The male had stepped back almost to the living room area and had his portable radio to his mouth , about to speak . He  | then apparently changed his mind and stepped back into the den . " Excuse me , but can I use your phone ? We put out an attempt-to-locate on your vehicle and I need to cancel it . " Trying to impress Lily with his professionalism , he added : " Any transmission regarding this incident is scrambled , so do n't worry about your address or name or anything going out . That 's why I have to use your phone . We ca n't scramble on the portable . " Her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly and stroked Shana 's hair . They would need access to the crime scene to collect evidence and take photos . Mentally starting at the front door , she recalled the file scattered there and felt the noose tighten again around her neck . Clinton knew she had taken the file , and whatever Oxnard detective assigned to investigate the murder might call Clinton , even ask for the file . She had to get it back , leave it as it had left Clinton 's hands . That meant copying the torn page of the police report and replacing it . She had to eradicate anything that could link him to the crime , for that would leave her wide-open as a suspect . A suspect with motive and no alibi . Prints . Before she could allow the police into the house , she must wash it down for prints . How long had he been in the house ? What had he touched ? Other than an eyewitness ID , fingerprints should be the only thread connecting her to his murder . The female officer , Talkington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A flash of green filled her mind with horror  --  the slug casing . The green slug ejected at the scene , placed in the chamber with her own hands . Surely , when the gun exploded , any prints would have been destroyed . But forensic science today . . . ? " ... other than description , we were waiting to discuss the details of the actual crime when you were present , Mrs. Forres-ter , " she spoke firmly , attempting to gain Lily 's attention . " I 'm sorry , " Lily said apologetically . " I did n't hear you . I ... I have n't slept . John , can you get me a cup of coffee ? "  | She smelled the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and briefly wondered why John had not thought of offering her a cup . " No , Mrs. Forrester , surely you are aware of the fact that you could destroy valuable evidence . Your husband gave us a sketchy outline of what occurred . " Lily responded , " I ate some chewing gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth . I did n't think . " " Well , to repeat what I was saying , Shana here basically gave us a physical description of the assailant , and we , of course , have already put out a broadcast on that information . We 'd like to get a full statement now . Then we 'll take you and your daughter to Pleasant Valley Hospital for an exam . " " Certainly , " Lily said . Officer Travis stepped into the conversation . He was chewing gum and smacking it as he spoke . Tall and dark , he exuded arrogance and Lily found him offensive . He looked bored and eager to leave , probably fully intending to let his partner complete the mounds of paperwork while he had breakfast somewhere . " We need the keys to the house you were renting so we can order a crime-scene unit over there . " Lily sat up on the sofa , straightening her back , assuming a prosecutor 's demeanor . " It makes more sense for me to be present . I could direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After my daughter and I complete the medical , I 'll go to the house and call for a unit to meet me there . " She turned with a degree of sarcasm in her voice . " You do agree with me , do n't you , Officer Travis ? " " Sounds like a plan , " he said , smacking loudly . Her attempts to deflate his enormous ego were like flies on the back of an elephant . Travis was the type of police officer who did n't give a damn if Mother Teresa was raped . He would never make sergeant . He worked to kick ass legally . Looking at his black boots , Lily bet the toes were loaded with steel . Enough brutality cases had crossed her desk to spot those who teetered on the line , who without the badge would end up in jail .  | " Officer Travis , " she said now , " I would appreciate it if you left the room while my daughter and I give our state-ments . " He looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the part he enjoyed . Then he turned and left , advising his partner that he 'd wait in the cruiser . Their statements took over an hour , as painful and embarrassing for Shana as she knew it was going to be . Talkington was good and Lily made a mental note to write a letter on her behalf to her commander . She took her time , did n't push Shana , and kept her voice soft and compassionate . The officer stood , adjusting the heavy gun belt and nightstick . " So , that 's all we 'll need for now . Investigators will contact you for more details probably by tomorrow . If you think of anything else , here 's my card . " " Thanks , " Lily said and meant it . " Are you ready now ? We 'll drive to the hospital . " " We 'll drive ourselves , " Lily answered . " But , Mrs. Forrester , an officer has to be present during the exam for chain of evidence . This is all just procedure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but we do n't have to ride over in a police car . We 'll meet you there . My daughter has been through enough . I do n't want the neighbors to know about this . We 'll say that we were burglarized or something . " John had been busy in the kitchen the whole time , cleaning , embarrassed by the mess . It was as if he had been caught by unexpected company . He walked the officer to the door and closed it , returning to Lily . " I 'll go with you . Do you want to help Shana get dressed ? " She turned and said quietly to Shana , " Do you need me to help you get dressed ? " " No . I 'll be fine . I want to take a bath , but the officer said I could n't . How can she tell me not to take a bath ? " Lily wanted to cry . " Because there may be evidence on your body . You ca n't take a bath . We also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital . They 'll want our clothes . " Lily suddenly looked down at her feet , at the old hiking boots . " I could n't find any tennis shoes last night , so I found these in an old box . " She glared at John , wanting to draw his attention away from the boots , her appearance . " It was nice of you to insist that I took everything I owned . Thanks , John . Now I do n't even have a change of clothes over here . " As soon as Shana shuffled down the hall , dragging the large blanket behind her , she turned to John . She wanted to slap him , scream at him in frustration , but the pitiful look on his face stopped her . " You 're angry at me , are n't you ? " he said . " Because I called the police without asking after we said we were n't going to do it . " She sighed . " You did what you thought was right . What I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm  --  I 'm . . . " The lightheadedness she had felt caused her now to see flashing lights before her eyes . She was going to pass out . She started to fall ; he grabbed her . " I 'm okay , " she said weakly , pulling away . " I was just dizzy for a moment . Why do n't you take a shower while I make some phone calls ? You look awful . " " Do you want me to make you something to eat ? I can make you some toast or something . Maybe if you eat ? " She fixed him with ice-cold eyes , red-rimmed and void of makeup . " Take a shower , John . Let me do what I have to do . " Like a scolded puppy , he turned , shoulders slumped , walking off to the bedroom . The clock in the kitchen said nine fortyfive as Lily snatched the phone and dialed the office . She started to ask for Butler 's office , but instead asked the operator to ring Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker phone . " It 's me , Lily . Take me off the speaker . " When his voice no longer sounded like he was in a well , she spoke softly . " Tell Butler for me that I have an emergency and ca n't come in today . I 'll call him later and be in tomorrow .  | You 'll need to review and assign some cases . They 're on my desk , some on the credenza . Whatever ca n't wait . " " You got it . Are we on for tonight ? " " I ca n't talk now . I promise I 'll explain everything later . Just cover me on this , please . " " Did you hear about Attenberg ? " Benjamin Attenberg was a superior court judge in his late sixties . He had once called Lily unconscionable in her interrogation of a witness , and they were not on the best of terms . " Tell me about it tomorrow . " She started to hang up . He persisted . " He 's dead  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to the office real early this morning and ran into Butler . Then he called me into his office . In fact , I just got out . And Lily , Butler had just finished talking with the governor about an appointment to replace him . " Lily braced herself against the kitchen counter . She did n't reply . " Are you listening ? " His voice was low , secretive . " You are being considered , Lily . Believe it or not , Butler asked my opinion . They want to fill this slot with a woman , so it 's between you and Carol Abrams . You may receive a call from the governor today even . If I were you , I would make it a point to come in no matter what 's going on . Unless , of course , you 're dying . " He laughed . " Or something . . . " she said out loud , not meaning to . Her mind was so jumbled now that she could no longer think . She blurted out the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at knife point . We 're on our way to the hospital now for the medical  --  legal . " " Jesus Christ . Why did n't you say something right away ? Are either of you hurt ? Where are you ? I 'll come ? " " Will they consider me now ? " she said , her voice small and breaking as she spoke . Stretching the curly phone cord to the sink , she splashed water on her face . " I 'm so sorry about this , Lily . God , I am so sorry . " " Richard , will you answer me please ? Will they still con-  | sider me for the appointment now that I 'm a rape victim ? " " They 'll consider you , of course , but you know as well as I do that it causes a problem . Hell , they might not rule you out . The presiding judge could shift all the sexual-related cases to other judges . There 's no way you could sit unbiased on those matters . " His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about , Lily . Can you talk ? Tell me what happened ? " " You know I lost the appointment . Why do n't you just say it ? We have three or four attorneys sitting pro tern and two retired judges . They 're not well versed enough with the complexities of the new laws regarding sex offenses to try them . What benefit can I be if I ca n't use my expertise to try these cases ? They 're flooding the calendar . " She paused , sucking in air . " I lost it . " He was placating now . " Do n't jump . Wait and see what happens . I think you should allow me to advise Butler , however , about your status . There 'll be more phone calls involved and some conferring if they ? " " Go ahead and tell them about the rape , " she said , defeated , " and tell them I 'll decline if offered . No need to try to make it work . I do n't want it that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene was surfacing ; she had to stop it . " Let them appoint Abrams . " Pert and perfect Carol , she thought . No blood on her white hands . " When will I see you ? " he said . " I 'll come right now if you 'll let me . " " No , " she said . " You ca n't . I 'm at the house with my husband . Just handle the cases . If you want to help me , do that . I 'll call later . " Hanging up the phone , she tried to hold herself together . She rushed to the bedroom and was relieved to see the bathroom door still closed , the shower still running . The black Magic Marker was still on the license plate , and at close range , in broad daylight , it would be visible . Grabbing a bottle of nail-polish remover , she headed for the garage , picking up the roll of paper towels from the kitchen counter .  | A minute later , Shana opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time Lily heard her . She was kneeling behind the Honda , and the towels were smeared with black Magic Marker . Shana approached her mother , sniffing , a puzzled look in her eyes . " What are you doing ? " she asked . Lily 's mind went blank . " Nothing . Are you ready ? Is Dad ready ? " She tossed the towels into the trash can in the corner of the garage . " What 's that smell ? What are you doing ? " Shana was antsy and persistent . She had on a pair of jeans and a pale blue blouse , and her eyes were darting around the garage as if she expected something to jump out at her . " Let 's go . Go get Dad . It wo n't take long , and then we 'll come back and you can sleep . They 'll give you something to help you rest . " Lily followed her back into the house . She stopped in the kitchen and hugged Shana tightly . " Do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there anything you want to ask me ? How do you feel ? " " I du n no . I feel dirty and rotten and tired and scared . And I keep thinking he 's going to come back here and find us and do it again . " Next door someone was mowing the lawn ; the noise was invasive not because it was loud , but because it was normal and they were not normal . In school , kids were clanging locker doors and laughing . Right about now at the courthouse , they were having recess and attorneys were rushing to grab a donut and a cup of coffee . " He 's not coming back . Please believe me . I know about this type of person . He 's afraid of being arrested . Right now he 's probably a hundred miles from here . And , honey , he does n't know where we live , not this house . " " In the movies , all the bad guys come back . Even when they think they 've killed them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth and started biting on a nail . Her father  | walked in and started to embrace her , but she pulled away , her back stiff , her arms rigid at her side . " I 'll back the Jeep out of the garage , " he said softly , visibly hurt by Shana 's aloofness , unable to comprehend how she felt . They drove in silence to the hospital . The female police officer was waiting in the lobby . She pulled Lily aside , explaining that unfortunately no female physician was on duty to perform the exam . She shrugged her shoulders and met Lily 's eyes woman to woman , knowing , compassionate . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " but we ca n't wait any longer . " With the nurse present , Lily tried to prepare Shana for the exam , telling her more or less what had to be done . The child listened quietly , chin dropped , eyes up , staring without hearing , her body wracked by exhaustion . On the examining table , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild with indignation , screaming and calling the doctor a " jerk nerd shit pighead " and kicking the top of his head . Her face turned bright red , a vein stood out in her neck , and she locked her jaw , transforming her soft face . Finally they gave her a shot and she calmed enough to complete the exam . To Lily , it was as if Shana was forced to endure another rape . Tears welled up in her eyes , and she had to leave the room . It was n't difficult to understand why untold numbers of these crimes still were n't reported to the authorities . They photographed them both . Shana had slight discolorations around her throat where his hands had been and other minor bruises on her buttocks . Drugged but awake , she had to roll over on the table , exposed , while Talkington photographed her . Lily leaned down by the table and placed her face next to her daughter 's . With her fingers she wiped away the tears from under her eyes , and stroked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her voice catching in her throat . " It 's almost over . " Lily had nicks at the sides of her mouth , a grayish , darkening bruise on her right shoulder that only she knew was from the kick of the shotgun and not incurred during the rape . She  | had a substantial bruise on her wrists . She realized that if anything came to light , the photographs of her bruised shoulder would be used against her as evidence . There was nothing she could do . If they ever got that close to the truth , it would be over anyway . Just in case , she told them that she thought the injury happened when she was moving the furniture in Shana 's room . They treated the small cuts with antiseptic . They tested them both for sexually transmitted diseases and gave them both a shot of penicillin . On the issue of AIDS , they told Lily privately that they should be tested again in the future to be certain . In the examining room , the doctor found a chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling her upper torso . " How long have you had these ? " he asked her . " Have you been having pains in your chest , around your ribs ? " Lily did n't know about the sores on her back , but the pains in her chest she had clearly felt . " I thought I was going to have a heart attack . Started a few weeks ago . " " You have herpes zoster . Shingles . It 's very painful . I 'm surprised you did n't visit your family physician before now . " He removed the rubber gloves and tossed them in the trash can . " I have herpes ? How did I get herpes ? " Lily asked , her voice high and shrill , her composure disintegrating . He smiled . " You do n't have genital herpes . First good news of the day , huh ? This is a virus , usually caused from nerves , but it 's in the same family . " " Great , " Lily said . " Give me the medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no cure . It will probably get worse before it gets better . You 'll get even more blisters . But it will go away . It 's not serious . " He was young , younger than Lily . He touched her shoulder . " I 'll give you some tranquilizers and , of course , something for your daughter . District attorney , " he said . " Stressful job . " She did n't answer and he left . There were a lot more stress-  | ful things than being a D.A. , like being raped . . . like killing someone . She sat on the table , her shoulders slumped , the hospital gown open in the back , her feet dangling off the edge like a small child 's , her hair stringy and matted . She lifted an arm and sniffed her armpit . She felt filthy and disgusting , in-human . Then she got dressed . As she pulled on her jeans , she thought that any minute they would come in and tell her the blood work had shown she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , a test of how much a person could endure ? In the school of life , before this had happened , she had seen herself as passing . Maybe she was n't in the top half of the class , maybe not the perfect mother . And others faced far worse adversity , achieved more , but she had persevered . She had used her average intelligence , with the force of hard work and drive ; had endured through law school with a baby and husband . She had continued in an empty , unfulfilling marriage for the sake of her child , remaining faithful in the face of continued accusations . In her career , she was relentlessly dedicated and carried the full weight of her responsibilities . But she had failed to endure all . Turning her back on her beliefs , she had met violence with violence . Many of the men and women she had sent to prison had been abused and victimized . She was one of them now . In the hall , she handed Talkington Shana 's gown from the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'll give it to the crime-scene unit . " On the short ride home , Shana 's lids were drooping and her head nodding , but she was still irate . " You did n't tell me they were gon na do that to me . Stick some metal thing inside of me with everyone watching , even that dog-face police officer . And they took pictures of me naked . " She started screaming . " You made them do this . I hate you . I hate everyone . I hate the world . " John stared at the road and drove . He was speechless . " It 's okay to be angry , Shana , " Lily said . " It might even  | be good for you to be angry and let your feelings out . You can say anything you want to me . " She turned , leaning over the front seat , close to Shana in the back . " Here , " she said , " pull my hair . Pull it as hard as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on , Shana . " Shana grabbed a handful of Lily 's hair and jerked it hard , causing Lily 's head to pull forward . She almost toppled over into the backseat . Lily did n't wince . Shana let go and fell back with a slap against the seat , fighting the drugs to stay awake . " Pretty funny , Mom , " she said without smiling . " Did they do the same things to you ? " " Yes , just about , and I did n't like it any more than you did . " A slight smile barely moved the edges of Shana 's pale mouth , but enough to be visible . " Want to pull my hair , Mom ? " she said . Lily responded , " No , thanks , little lady . " She reached for her daughter 's hand and smiled at her . " You might kick the hell out of me like you did that doctor . " Their hands laced together tightly and their eyes met . A ray of sunshine shot between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling around their hands . She was still leaning over the seat awkwardly , and the motion of the car was pulling them apart , each one resisting , lingering . By moving her fingers , Shana rearranged their hands so they were palm to palm . She stretched her fingers until they were perfectly aligned with her mother 's . She maintained the contact , pushing her palm slightly into Lily 's , spreading her fingers and taking Lily 's along . In this small gesture was a moment of beauty and utmost tenderness , that rare occasion when two human beings truly comprehend each other 's pain and experience the purest form of emotion : compassion .  | Detective Sergeant Bruce Cunningham opened the door to his unmarked unit and tossed in a case file and his tape recorder . He caught a glimpse of his scuffed black shoes and gave thought to stopping by the barber shop for a shine . What he really needed was a new pair of shoes , but with three kids and a wife who no longer worked , a shine would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , tan , and masculine , but the suit that had once strained to contain his bulging biceps now hid an abundance of soft flesh . His bushy mustache was a darker shade of blond than his thick hair , and he had a bad habit of letting it grow until it almost covered his lip . He glanced at his watch . It was almost five o'clock and he 'd have to fight the rush-hour traffic all the way downtown to the morgue to look at today 's stiff . The day shift had done a cursory workup at the scene and then dumped the entire case on his desk without so much as a word . This was n't the way it worked in Omaha , where he 'd been a cop for seventeen years before relocating to a position with the Oxnard P.D . five years ago . In Omaha , things were different . People were friendly and  | honest  --  basic hardworking midwestern folks . Cops were cops . They were n't thieves or killers or brutal , out-of-control animals . They were good guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department worked toward the same goals and assisted each other whenever they could . Here in Oxnard , he 'd seen officers spend longer trying to kiss off a case to another officer than it would take to simply handle the fucking thing themselves . That was the kind of mentality he was surrounded by here in California . But it went much further than that . Being lazy and incompetent he could adjust to  --  he did n't like it , but he could accept it . What he 'd seen in the past two months , though , was just more than he could stomach . He stood there and stared out over the parking lot , flicking the stiff hairs of his mustache with one hand . Suddenly he slammed the car door shut and returned to the building . His anger built step by step as he made his way down the narrow hallway to the Internal Affairs Division . The two men sitting at their desks jumped and almost reached for their weapons when Cunningham came barreling through the door . " You incompetent motherfuckers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and you still botched it . These guys are as dirty as the Omaha stockyards . " Detective Stanley Haddock leaned back in his chair and laughed . Then the smile fell from his narrow face , and he flopped forward and fixed the big detective with a steely gaze . " Get out of our office , Cunningham . We have work to do . " " Work ? You call how you handled that case work ? Fucking disaster is what it was . Fucking national disaster . And the people of this city pay your salaries . If I were you guys , I would n't show my face in public after this fiasco . " The other detective came from behind his desk and took Cunningham 's arm , physically pulling him out of the office into the hall as Cunningham kept glancing back at the other man over his shoulder . Whereas Haddock 's face looked as though it had been carved out of stone , Rutherford 's was as round as a beach ball . " Look , " he said , his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told to do . Get the picture ? These were veteran cops with years on the force . This came down from the top . " " Thieves and killers , " Cunningham said , his face still flushed with anger , " not cops . Do n't put me in the same category with them . It 's bad enough I have to admit I work for the same department . " He reached into his jacket for his cigarettes . After offering one to the other man , he stuck one in his mouth , but did n't light it , letting it dangle there as he spoke . " First , we got these animals in L.A. beating some guy to a bloody pulp on videotape for the whole world to see , and now we have our own guys blowing dope dealers away and pocketing the drug money . " " There 's no proof . Your report was all speculation . " " Proof , " he said , lighting his cigarette and inhaling the smoke , bracing himself against the wall . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say he pulled on them ? well , forensics says the damn thing is so old , the firing pin fell out when they tried to test-fire it at the range . That gun was a plant and you know it . " The other man shook his head from side to side and dropped his eyes to the ground . " Let it go , Bruce . " " Look , Rutherford , this guy , this dealer , he owned three brand-spanking-new nine-millimeter Rugers . We have the sales receipts in the file . Why would a dealer carry an old rusted .38 to a twenty-grand crack buy when he owned an arsenal of the finest weapons ? You answer that one , I 'll let it go . " " The story 's as classic as they get : Franks and Silver made the connection and the mark solicited the buy . He was supposed to show with the cash at the designated time and place . Instead he appeared with a gun and tried to take them out and steal the dope . Classic drug deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other man and then barked , " Answer my question . " " We are n't exactly concerned with designer guns here , are we ? The next thing I 'm going to be hearing from you is that  | a gun makes some suspect 's sports jacket pull , so he could n't possibly have been carrying it and is therefore innocent as a babe in the woods . Give us a break , guy . Let it go . Just consider it one less crack dealer we have to worry about . " " Sure , " Cunningham said , disgusted , then added , " Gosh , Rutherford , with a few sub-machine guns , we could go out there and clean up the whole city in a matter of hours . What a novel concept . " He dropped his cigarette on the floor , grinding it into the linoleum with his heel . Then he pushed himself off the wall and adjusted his tie . " Keep up the good work . If I ever need any cash , I know how to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , Bruce , " the other man called to him , " I heard you finally got a conviction on the Owen homicide . Fine work you did there , guy . " He did n't look back but continued down the hall and out of the building . His anger subsided . The mere mention of the Owen case had a calming effect on him and made the fact that two of his fellow officers were no better than perps off the street a little easier to swallow . There were still some good days on the job , when he felt he was actually making a dent in this disgusting cesspool of a world , doing what good guys are supposed to do  --  put the bad guys away . The Owen case had been a feather in his cap , no doubt about it . It was a landmark case , one he 'd been working on for over three years . Poor old Ethel Owen , he thought , back in the parking lot again headed to his car . They 'd never found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to stockpile enough evidence to get a conviction for second-degree murder just a few days before . First homicide in Ventura County to go down without a body , and he was the man who 'd made it happen . That makes a guy feel proud , he said to himself , reaching the door to his unit . He got behind the wheel and then leaned out and looked at the sky , thinking it might actually rain . He missed the seasons , got sick of the sameness , and was terrified of earthquakes .  | If a plane flew overhead or a large semi passed and caused so much as a slight shake or rattle , his enormous frame was in the nearest doorway in seconds . He had seen more bodies than you could shake a fist at , stared down the barrel of a dozen or more guns , but he hated the earth moving beneath him . Everyone teased him about it , including his wife and kids . His wife , Sharon , insisted that it was n't the earthquakes that made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gangs , the violence , the senselessness of it all . At night sometimes , when his wife and kids were asleep , Cunningham would sit at the dining room table for hours poring over their finances , trying to figure a way out , a way back , wishing he 'd never left to begin with , asking himself if it had been worth it . Then he 'd get up the next morning and have to stand over a tiny body on the street , the victim of another insane drive-by shooting , and wonder if one of these days , God forbid , he 'd roll up and find one of his own kids spread out on the sidewalk , shot dead while they were merely walking to school . He pulled out of the parking lot and headed to the morgue , his mind returning to the Owen case . He 'd known Ethel Owen 's slick young boyfriend had killed her from day one . They 'd found physical evidence of a homicide at her home : blood and obvious signs of a struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he 'd cleaned out old Ethel 's bank accounts and sold her brand-new Cadillac , forging her name on the pink slip . When the jury had delivered a guilty verdict , Cunningham had walked out in the sunshine and could have sworn he saw Ethel 's face smiling down at him . Maybe he stayed because of people like Ethel , he thought now , pulling into the parking lot of the morgue . Once inside , he flashed his badge , asked to see the Hernandez case , and followed the skinny , effeminate lab attendant to one of the tiled autopsy rooms . The attendant checked the name and number on the man 's toe , attached like a price tag in a discount department store , and then left Cunningham , prancing to a corner of the room to work on a chart .  | Pulling down the white sheet , he noted that the victim fit the description of about eighty percent of the homicides in Oxnard and about fifty percent of the suspects : Hispanic , early to late twenties , five-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over his shoulder and made certain the attendant 's back was turned . He then removed a small jar of camphor from his coat pocket and dabbed a little in both nostrils . He did n't mind looking at dead people ; he just hated to smell them . The cause of death was obvious : a huge hole in the center of his chest where his heart used to be . A glimmer of stainless steel from the table made him think for a moment that something was inside there . He moved closer and bent down to look . The skinny attendant turned and chirped , " We have the missing parts in a jar if you want to see them . " Cunningham just sneered . He always wondered what kind of sickness caused people to want to seek employment among the dead , particularly on county wages . The strangest part was they were always so cheerful , making him think they were going to start whistling or break out in song . He had removed only a portion of the sheet before it snagged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder , yanking it down all the way . The reason was suddenly apparent : one arm was connected only by threads of rubbery , exposed ligaments . The word overkill came to mind . " You got body fluids back yet ? " he asked the attendant . " Let 's see . " The man flipped open the chart and glanced at it . " Not complete , but looks like blood alcohol was .07 and no drugs . Give us a break here , this guy only checked in this morning , and a lot more guests were registering than checking out . " " Cute , " Cunningham replied without a chuckle . " Hell , the guy was n't even legally drunk . " After he said it , he remembered that the crime had occurred early that morning . He removed his tape recorder from his jacket and started speaking into it , describing the man 's injuries . Finished , he hit the stop  | button and pulled the sheet back over the body . He 'd seen all he needed to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made smacking noises at the attendant . " Stay away from the merchandise , sweetie , " he said . In his unmarked unit he radioed the station : " Six-five-four , Station One , " he called . " Station one , go ahead , 654 . " They usually did n't answer right away and he was still turning pages . " Stand by . " There it was : the only eyewitness , the victim 's brother . " Station , call 495-3618 and have a Manny Hernandez meet me in front of his house in thirty minutes . " Cunningham did n't just walk up to doors and ring doorbells like the rookies did . He wanted to live a few more years . Pulling up at a Stop ' n ' Go , he bought a few packs of cigarettes and a bag of Doritos . He placed the open bag next to him and tossed chips into his mouth as he drove . A few drops of moisture struck the windshield and then quit . Typical California rainstorm  --  lasted all of five minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Hispanic male resembling the deceased stood at the curb with his hands in the pockets of his baggy denims . Pretty goodlooking guy , Cunningham thought . Brother had n't been badlooking either back when he was still in one piece . The boy was wearing a red shirt , L.A. Raiders baseball cap , and black sunglasses . The detective motioned to him from the open win-dow . " Get in , " he said . Hernandez shuffled over and climbed in . A woman was standing in the yard , a baby slung over her hip , chattering away in Spanish to an older woman . Probably still talking about the murder . Neighborhood entertainment , he thought , Colonia style . Driving down the street past a few houses , Cunningham pulled to the curb and parked under a large oak tree . " Want a Dorito ? " He extended the open sack to Manny . " No , man , I do n't want no fucking Dorito . They fucking blew my brother away . " He was fidgeting in his seat , tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his pants . " You wired , Hernandez ? What 're you on ? " " Nothing , man . I ai n't on nothing . " Cunningham threw three or four Doritos into his mouth and crunched them loudly with his teeth . A speck of Dorito hung in the thick hairs of his mustache . Tapping the back of an open pack of Marlboros , he slid one halfway out and extended it to Manny . " Want a cigarette ? " A thin hand reached forward to accept . Inside the knuckles were tattooed letters . " You in a gang , Manny ? " " No , I ai n't in no gang , " he said but sucked so hard on the cigarette that his cheeks caved in . He looked defiantly at the detective as he spoke and blinked his dark eyes every few seconds , like lights on a Christmas tree . Cunningham had a theory that people blinked when they lied or when they were high on drugs . Might be a little of both going on here , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment disappeared . " Tell me what you saw here this morning . " " I told all I knew already . I do n't know nothing else . " " Tell me again , " Cunningham said gruffly . " I 'm stupid . I ca n't read . " " I was dozing . . . heard a shot ... then right away another ... boom . I ran to the front door and saw my brother down ... bleeding from a motherfucking hole in his chest . " Manny 's own chest started to rise and fall . He started talking faster . " Man , there was blood all over the sidewalk and his arm was blown off . But  --  but this guy . . . this guy was a fucking ghost . " His eyes were wide in terror . " He was a spook . . . tall white guy . . . skinny . Face looked like those guys with AIDS . Bald . I du n no . " Cunningham 's eyebrows arched in question . " Bald ? You told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . You never said the man was bald . " " He was wearing a cap , man . . . but for some reason . . . I think he was bald under that cap . No fucking hair at all . I  | got ta go , man . " He reached for the door handle , but Cunningham grabbed his shirttail . He slapped him back against the seat . " What about the car ? Did you get the make and license ? " " Spook was standing behind the car . . . red . . . box car of some kind . . . Nissan , Toyota . . . Volkswagen . . . du n no . I did n't get the plate . I dove , man . . . dove when I saw the barrel of that gun . " He flicked the cigarette out the open window . " Got ta go . " This time he flung open the car door and made it clear . Cunningham reached for him , but he was too fast . He slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file to the floorboard and was almost out the passenger door when he saw Manny reach inside his pants and shoot a stream of gold urine at a tree . He then returned to the vehicle . " Told you I hadda fucking go . " Cunningham turned to him and barked , " Do n't move a muscle even if you have to take a shit or I 'll cuff you . Corn-prende ? " " Station one , 654 , " he said into the mike , his eyes glued to Manny . " Get the sketch artist to stand by . I 'm coming in with a witness for a composite drawing . " There was no answer , only other radio traffic . Then : " 10-98 , 654 , just made it . He was leaving for the day . He 's standing by . " Manny looked up and down the street and hunkered down as they drove away . Cunningham continued the questioning . He was beginning to like this case . " So you 're certain you do n't know the shooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya ... not a homeboy .. . not anyone . . . weird fucking spook . " " Your brother just got out of jail . Did he get in trouble inside ? Was he into drugs , dealing , robbing ? " " He called from the jail . Told me to bring the car . We waited and then split . I left the keys with the desk . Hadda do some things . I did n't know he was out till I saw him laying there dead . He ai n't into anything . " Depositing Manny with the police artist , Cunningham went  | to records and filled out slips on both the victim and Manny . " I want everything you have , " he told the chubby records clerk , " F.I . ' s , bookings , any units responding to that address in the past , any intelligence info . " F.I . ' s were small printed cards , Field Intelligence , that officers filled out when they had contact with someone in the field that looked suspicious but did not warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer could identify subjects who were with other subjects at the time and place they were contacted . It was an excellent source of information and had solved many a crime . The rows of desks in the Investigation Bureau were empty . Cunningham carried a cup of mucky coffee pilfered from the radio room and a Snickers bar from the vending machine . Tossing the Snickers into the drawer for later , he lit a cigarette and started going through his other cases . He loved working this shift , with no brass around and no phones ringing off the hook . In the quiet he could think . The brunette from records stomped into the room , always pissed over during her job , and slammed the requested information on his desk . " Did you hear the news ? " she said . " The jury found not guilty on those officers in L.A. ? the Rodney King case . They 're rioting in South Central L.A. now , burning down buildings . Buildings ! Can you believe it ? They 're going to burn the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did n't surprise him . How any jury could completely ignore what the tape had clearly shown was beyond him . He 'd seen the tape . Half the world had seen the tape . The guy could have been cuffed about five blows back , yet the officers kept on beating him until they almost killed him . Cunningham was just glad he wore plain clothes and not a uniform and worked in Oxnard right now instead of L.A. He bent his head to the task in front of him . He had to admit that the Hernandez brothers were pretty clean . In addition to the recent attempted rape and kidnapping that had been dismissed , Bobby had a five-year-old arrest and convic-  | tion for burglary . Manny had several busts for being under the influence of cocaine , also a number of years back . Crack was of course the inexpensive drug of choice today , but there was nothing to indicate the brothers indulged . Thinking the whole mess amounted to nothing , he started to pull out the Snickers . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only eight now . He began working his way through a stack of F.I . ' s . After five or six , he was getting bored  --  nothing but a bunch of names and places . Then he picked up the sixth one and read the names off again . They had been stopped for an open-container violation about two months before , but the officer had passed on citing them . Bobby Hernandez had been driving his van , Manny was a passenger , and the other passengers were listed as Carmen Lopez , Jesus Valdez , and Richard Navarro . Cunningham sat up and felt his body surge with excitement . Carmen Lopez had been brutally murdered with her Anglo boyfriend , Peter McDonald , the previous month in Ventura . Two of the suspects in custody pending trial along with three others were Valdez and Navarro . Bingo . This had been his lucky night ; he 'd have to go to the Catholic church on Wednesday now and really try his luck . The first bingo tonight had been small  --  the tattoos that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gang . The second was a much larger prize . He went to retrieve Manny and found that the sketch had been completed . If this was the man Manny had seen , he was right in calling him weird . His mouth was small and perfectly shaped , his jaw softly rounded , and the whole picture had a strange quality about it . According to the drawing  --  actually , a computerized composite  --  the cap had been pulled low on his forehead , riding high on the back of his head . There was no hair around his ears or his long neck at all , probably why Manny got the feeling the man was bald . " Make copies and fax this out to every agency in California . Make sure every member of this department gets a copy , " he  | barked at the artist . " Remember to note that he is armed and dangerous and wanted for murder . " The composite artist was tall and dark , a neatly groomed young man , a relative newcomer to the department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have plans with my wife tonight . Get records to do it . It 's their job anyway . I just make pictures on my computer here , remember ? " " Fuck records . They 'll just put it aside for the day shift . You make the copies and stand there while they fax it . Do it or I 'll have your asshole for dinner instead of chicken . " Shoving Manny in front of him , he said , " Walk . You and I are going to have a real heart-to-heart . We 're gon na get real friendly before this night is over . "  | After two hours of tormented sleep , twisting and thrashing amid dreams of red-robed men with knives and jagged holes in their chests , Lily drove to the rented house . She left Shana out cold from the medication with her father . Opening the front door , she was assaulted by the sickening odor of vomit , and she ran to the kitchen for Pine Sol , fighting back her own nausea . Once the bathroom was clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface the rapist might have touched . The slip of paper with his address , torn the night before from the office file , was carefully taped back together from the back . After the police had left , she would stop at the copy store and Xerox it , placing the photocopy in the file . She called for the crime-scene unit and collapsed in a heap on the kitchen floor . The screen door was open and it had clouded over . Even a few drops of rain had fallen and were glistening on the rose bushes . The gloom seemed right for this day . She recalled how as a child it had always rained on Good Friday , the day they had crucified Christ . Her mother told her that the sky would get  | dark around three , the time He might have died , and as Lily recalled , it frequently did . Those were the days when she dreamed of becoming a nun and used to dress up in white sheets and roam around the house when everyone was outside . Those were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prayed then and no one had heard her prayers . She soon stopped praying and dreamed of becoming a person who could punish other people . The first night it had happened , even now she could not really blame him . It was she who had crawled into his bed , after he 'd been into the brandy that Granny no longer allowed him to drink due to his diabetes . Granny was small , like a child , barely five feet tall , and he had mistaken her in his drunken stupor , aroused by memories of the past . Afterward , he had kneeled by the bed and prayed and washed her and begged her to keep the " secret . " He 'd told her that his elbow had slipped and hurt her so bad , and at only eight years old , she did n't know any better . The next day , on her birthday , he had a beautiful chestnut pony delivered to the ranch . But the perversity would continue for five more summers . He wanted to stroke her , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she allowed him to do so , he rewarded her with an extravagant gift . The pawing was n't really so bad . Sometimes it even felt good . She would close her eyes real tight and think of what she wanted him to buy her : a new doll maybe , or a new saddle for her pony , Bay Boy , or a beautiful new dress . As the years went by , she became aware that their " secret " afforded her something most children never have : power . If she wanted to , she could make him cry , saying she was going to tell . It was like a cruel game she played with him , and she played it often . To everyone else he was a hero : rich and generous , lieutenant governor of Oklahoma , past president of the Rotary , board member of various charities . When her mother spoke of him , her eyes became alive , and her father admired him . He and her grandmother would roll into town in their big Lincoln Continental , loaded down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . As Lily digressed , she pulled her knees to her chest and began rocking back and forth on the kitchen floor . On one sweltering Dallas day , Lily had been riding her bike up and down the block all morning , playing jacks on the porch , and spraying herself with the garden hose in the backyard . School had just let out the day before for the summer vacation . The year had been one of nightmares and bed-wetting , but she had kept the terrible " secret " locked inside . She came in to change her wet clothes and found her mother in her room , the suitcase open on the bed . " I 'm not packing a lot this summer , " her mother said . " You always come back with so many new things . " She suddenly realized Lily was sopping wet , dripping water . " Get those wet clothes off before you get sick . Look what you 're doing to the carpet . " Her voice got higher . Lily did n't move . She could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . now . Do you hear me , young lady ? " " I 'm not going , " Lily screamed . " I 'm not going . . . not going . " She placed her hands on her hips in defiance , shaking her head from side to side , water from her wet hair spraying the walls . She marched to the bed and pushed the suitcase with both hands ; it toppled to the floor . Folded underwear and socks spilled out . " Look what you 've done . You change your clothes this minute and put everything back exactly as it was . I 'm going to get the belt and spank you if you do n't stop . What brought this on ? " She glared at the child , her chest heaving . " I do n't want to go . I do n't like Granddaddy . He 's creepy . He 's not like Daddy . I wan na stay here . " Her mother sat on the edge of the bed , sighing deeply , pushing a long lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of yourself , Lillian . After all your grandfather has done for you . . . for us . He adores you . He would be heartbroken if he heard you saying these things . Have n't I always told you that you have to respect older people ? When people  | get older , they act different , but they 're not creepy , just old . " " He hurt me . " There , she had said it . She could n't keep his old " secret " no matter what he bought her . It made her feel funny inside , bad funny , like when she was sick with the flu and about to throw up . Her mother 's soft face tensed with annoyance , but she tried to speak calmly . " And just how did he hurt you ? Did he spank you ? He 's supposed to spank you if you 're bad . He 's like your dad in the summer , and your dad spanks you . You bring that on yourself , Lily , with your temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling warmth from her body ; chill bumps rose on her skin . " His elbow slipped and he hurt me bad . " Her mother stood and picked up the suitcase , placing it back on the bed , open again . " Oh , is that all ? You 're such a little actress . Everything is such a big production . " She turned and started removing clothing from the chest of drawers and faced Lily with her arms full . " Did he say he was sorry ? " " Yes , " she answered , hugging herself , thinking she was bad , seeing that reflection of herself in her mother 's eyes . She wet the bed , threw temper tantrums , made her mother nervous and upset . That 's why they sent her away , so her mother could rest because Lily was so bad . They said it was because it was hot and miserable in Dallas in the summer and nice and cool at the cabin , but she knew it was n't true . This year she had tried so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he touches me with his old creepy hands , I hate it . " Her mother took hold of Lily 's shoulders and turned her in the direction of the bathroom , giving her a little push to get her moving , the conversation over . " He 's just old , Lily . You have to feel sorry for him . He just wants to love you . You 're his little angel . Besides , you do n't hate him when he buys you all those pretty dresses and dolls and ponies . Go now . Get dressed . " Every year when the suitcases came out , Lily regarded them in horror . She saw herself inside those bags , like a puppet case  | being handed over to the old puppeteer who would stick his hands inside and make the puppet do whatever he wanted and the puppet had no choice , no voice , because no one would listen . When the old puppeteer put the puppets away and shut the lid on the case , Lily knew the poor puppets cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother spanked her with the belt until angry welts rose on her spindly legs . She never spoke badly of him again . He died of a massive heart attack the year Lily turned thirteen . At the funeral she wore her best dress , one she had earned in his hands , and she curled and combed her hair as she would for a birthday party . Walking by his open casket behind her sobbing and hysterical mother , her solemn and downcast father , Lily held her body erect and tossed her silken curls . She looked down at his waxy face , lingering with fingers locked on the edge of the coffin , a tragic and touching picture to those in the church watching , the hundreds who had come to honor the great man . " Now you 're in the case , " she whispered and smiled . " And I bet you 're going to cry when they close the lid . " A few days later , when she was alone in the house , she removed every single item he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the alley . There were so many dresses with crisp petticoats that she had to jump inside the can itself and stomp them down . Then she came back with handfuls of shoes , hair ornaments , old dolls , beads , and bracelets , tossing them in and slamming the tin lid down with a loud , satisfying clang of finality . She could hear the metal ring of that lid now as she sat on the kitchen floor . Then she realized the doorbell was ringing : the crime-scene unit had arrived . It was four o'clock . She 'd been waiting over an hour . Once they gathered their evidence and left , the urge was overwhelming to call the Oxnard police or local hospitals to see if the rapist was dead , but she dared not . In two hours she would watch the local news . Her thoughts turned to cases she had handled in the past  | and the Judicial Council rules regarding circumstances in aggravation and mitigation that were used to determine the severity of sentences . Lily thought of the rule : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Remembering days in courtrooms when she had argued fiercely for maximum terms , citing callousness and lack of remorse , pointing to the blank , emotionless faces of defendants with an angry , accusing finger , she realized that a lack of remorse was a primary emotional defense against guilt . Lily had to believe in what she had done . The knife had been at her throat , the blade against her skin . In his eyes was the ability to end both her life and Shana 's . She knew the look . She 'd seen it in her own eyes in the rearview mirror on the way to Oxnard . When she called Butler 's office , his secretary informed her that he was in a meeting due to end any second . " Buzz him for me , please , it 's important . " Soon Butler came on : " Lily , hold on a minute . " There were male voices in the background on the open line . " That will be fine . Tomorrow at ten , then . " His deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked , Lily , quite simply shocked .. . deeply sorry . Your daughter ? How is she ? " " As good as can be expected . " Taking a deep , raspy breath , she continued , " I 'd rather speak to you in person , Paul . I can be there in forty-five minutes if you do n't mind waiting . " " Take your time . I 'll wait . " The shower was steaming when she stepped in ; it hit the back of her carpet-burned calves and she jumped , almost losing her footing . The water cascaded over her head and ran off the tip of her nose . Her entire body ached ; she felt battered . Placing both her palms against the still cool tile , she realized that she was crying , but the tears ran off with the water . " Why ? Why ? Why ? " she cried . With each utterance of the word , she slapped her palms against the tiles until they were stinging and red . " What have I done to deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp pain in her wrists stopped her .  | She carefully painted her face with makeup . It was her mask . She wanted to face Butler looking exactly the same as she always did . Nothing has changed , she said to herself . Nothing at all has changed . The elevator was crowded with people leaving , and Lily smiled and exchanged a few words mechanically . The receptionist buzzed her through the security doors . " How 're you feeling ? " the girl asked politely . Lily 's head jerked and she wondered how many people in the office knew . In the next moment , though , she realized that the girl probably just thought she had been ill . They had to tell people some reason why she had n't been in the office all day . " Must be a twenty-four-hour virus or something , " she said , placing her hand on her stomach . Stopping at records , the clerk already gone for the day , she dropped the Hernandez file and several others in the basket . She had Xeroxed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's secretary was also gone , and she walked directly into his large office . The room was not lit by fluorescent lighting like all the others . Butler had real lamps , making it appear more like a well-appointed library in a stately home . He stood and walked around the desk , extending both his hands . " My dear , " he said , pulling her to him in a brief embrace . " Sit . Sit . Tell me all about it . " He waved his hand at one of the high-backed leather chairs . Not returning behind his desk , he took a seat in the chair next to Lily 's and turned , facing her , waiting for her to speak . " There 's not a lot to tell , Paul , " she said softly , controlled . " I guess I left the back door open , and he came in and threw my robe over my face , like putting a blanket over me . He had a knife . He then got us both on the bed and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily inhaled deeply when she mentioned Shana 's name , pressing her body back into the seat . " He was scared off by some sirens in the neigh-borhood . " " But where was your husband during all this ? "  | " We just separated a week ago . I was renting a house in Ventura , not far from here . " Butler 's brows were knitted and his mouth tense . " Had you ever seen this man ? Was he someone you prosecuted ? " " No , I never saw him before . Shana was waiting earlier on the porch when I came home . Maybe he saw her and decided to come back later . Who knows ? He was a rapist , though . I do n't think his intentions were to rob us . No , not at all . " " Your daughter ? How is she handling this ? How old is she , Lily ? " Butler 's demeanor was calm and soothing . " She 's thirteen . " Lily 's voice cracked . She hated the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . " She 's resting now , sedated . " " You know you can take some time off , " he said , but flicked a glance out the window and she sensed the lack of sincerity in that statement . It would create mammoth problems . Unable to remain seated in the chair , she stood and started pacing . " I 'm coming back to work tomorrow . I 'll probably even send my daughter back to school . " She had just arrived at this decision as she spoke . " The more we let this disrupt our lives , the larger it will become . " She stopped and faced him . " The appointment . Richard told me . Has it been filled ? " " I 'm sorry , " he said , turning away , refusing to meet her gaze . " Carol Abrams was appointed and accepted a few hours ago . It was a tough situation . Attenberg had to be replaced at once . You were considered ? " " Was the deciding factor my rape ? Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a factor . I wo n't lie and say it was n't , but the deciding factor ? They wanted a female . It was between you and Abrams , and you were both highly qualified . There 'll be other situations . Although nothing like this has ever come up , I 'm confident the bench can accommodate you in the future . " Seeing the conversation had returned to business , Butler moved to the large chair behind his desk . Lily continued to pace .  | " Who 's going to prosecute Lopez  --  McDonald now ? " she retorted , her disappointment almost at the verge of anger . " Shit , I 'm up to my eyeballs in cases now . I have no one with the experience to handle a case as complex as this one . " " Lily , if you 'll relax a little and just listen , I 'll tell you how we 're going to handle it . I realize you 've been through a terrible ordeal . Perhaps this should wait ? " She had picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go ahead . I want to know where I stand . " " You and Richard Fowler are going to handle the unit and the case . I 'm moving Silverstein back to cover Richard 's unit temporarily . You 'll split the workload right down the middle . " At the mention of working with Richard , Lily 's muscles contracted and the pen flew through the air like a rubber band , barely missing Butler 's head . " Shit , " she said . Then quickly : " I mean , about the pen . If that 's what you want ... " " Can you handle a case like this ? " he asked . Lily was indignant . " Of course I can . How could you even ask ? " He fixed his eyes on her , looking down his nose . " I mean emotionally , uh , after what you 've been through . " Picking up her briefcase and purse , she said firmly , " I 'm a prosecutor , a mad dog . You know , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , do n't you think ? " After the kill , she thought , how appropriate . The more real and horrible her life became , the more absurdity she saw in the entire charade . Little words , little gestures , little feelings , all marching in one big line to the finish . " Exactly my own thoughts . " Butler stood . " I 'll walk you to your car . " When the phone rang , Richard was at home sorting through the day 's mail at his desk in the spare bedroom he had made into a study . " Can you talk ? It 's me . " She was at a service station only a few blocks from the house . It was drizzling again and she  | was standing outside . The traffic from the freeway was deafening . " Hold on . A semi just went by . I ca n't hear . " He yelled , " Where are you ? Are you okay ? " " I 'm at a service station . I just left Butler 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to see if Shana 's awake . I do n't know why I called , but I said I would . " " Did he tell you about the appointment ? " " Yes , and he told me about your moving back to the unit to work with me , about us prosecuting McDonald  --  Lopez to-gether . " " How do you feel about that ? " He was still yelling even though she could hear him fine now . " I can hear you , do n't yell . I 'm numb about everything now . You know , no sleep and all . " She paused , noting the rain had stopped . " I guess it will work out . I need a friend and I 'm going to need a lot of help . Better go now . I plan to come to work tomorrow . If I ca n't , I 'll call . " " Take care of yourself , Lily . If you 're worried about me pushing myself on you , do n't . " Her last comment was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of my big concerns right now . Tomorrow , huh ? " On the way home , she stopped at a pet store and bought Shana a precious puppy . Life seemed to be going in circles . Puppies , ponies . They were all about the same .  | Lily was driving John 's Jeep and pulled it alongside her Honda in the garage . She carried the tiny Italian greyhound puppy in her arms and grabbed some towels from the clothes drier , which she placed in an empty cardboard box , and then bent down to put the little animal inside . When she stood up , vertigo momentarily engulfed her and she thought she was going to black out . Right in front of her eyes was a blank spot in the garage where her father 's shotgun had leaned for years before she moved out . If John had not forced her to take it with her along with the rest of her things when she 'd moved , she would not be a murderer . The garage door was open and she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching the street for any cars she did n't recognize . The police could be watching her . Satisfied no one was there , she hurried past the Honda into the house . John was in the kitchen , about to place a chicken in the oven to roast . He leaned back against the counter , facing Lily . His light blue cotton shirt was wrinkled , and dried rings of  | perspiration stained the armpits . " She 's still asleep , " he said . Lily felt his gaze follow her as she headed to the den and fell onto the sofa . The local news was in progress . " Did you hear me , Lily ? Can you at least answer me ? " " I heard you . I want to watch the news . " She sat upright , her hands folded in her lap , her eyes glued to the screen . John opened the oven door and slammed it shut , took out a smaller pot and banged it on top of the range . She could hear the flick of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. At present they were reporting at least eleven major fires , numerous injuries , and two firemen injured , one shot . Nothing registered . Lily stared , waiting . " Should I wake her for dinner ? " The female newscaster was speaking , returning to the regular broadcast . " Another senseless act of violence claimed the life of a twenty-eight-year-old Oxnard man early this morning in what police are calling a gang-related drive-by shooting . As the man 's brother looked on in horror ... " " Lily . " She screamed , " Shut up , John . " " . . . unknown assailant opened fire , killing the man in front of his residence in the Colonia section of Oxnard . " The newscaster turned with a plastic smile to the weatherman . " So , it looks like the rain has stopped , Stu . We could certainly use a little more with those fires burning . " Lily pressed the off button on the remote control and got up , walking to the kitchen bar . " I 'm sorry , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching . An eyewitness , the man 's own brother , had watched her kill him . I 'm sorry , she said to the dead man 's brother . I 'm sorry , she said to John . I 'm sorry , sorry , sorry . The words kept playing like a mantra in her head as the images washed in blood played red before her eyes . She wanted to say the words , tell him what she 'd done , have him run to her and comfort her , but he could not offer comfort . His eyes bore into  | her , burned through her , but she could n't speak . He was too weak , too unpredictable . In the beginning , she 'd seen him as a safe haven in the storm , but he had been only a lean-to . John pulled hard on his cigarette . The smoke swirled from his mouth ; twin streams exited his nostrils . The puppy began whining in the garage and John looked toward the noise , puzzled . " I bought Shana a puppy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Tomorrow I 'll get a referral from Social Services for a good psychologist . " Lily fetched the tiny greyhound from the garage , and as she headed to Shana 's room , she stopped and looked back at John . " I 'm going to wake her . That way she can sleep tonight and go to school in the morning . " A look of astonishment swept over John 's face . He stabbed the cigarette out in the already overflowing ashtray . " Are you trying to tell me that you 're going to insist that the child goes to school tomorrow after what she 's been through ? You 're incredible , Lillian . " " Do n't call me that . You only do it to annoy me . " She inhaled , puffing her chest out . " Yes , she 's going to school . If you baby her and give in and stay home from work and sit around all day with her , she 'll end up afraid of her own shadow . Let her go back to her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please listen to me on this . " " Whatever you say . Whatever you say . " He turned and started taking plates from the cabinet . Walking down the dark hall to Shana 's room , Lily imagined them coming to arrest her . She saw the police cars pull up in front , the neighbors gathered watching , Shana crying as they led her away , her hands cuffed behind her back . She was holding the little dog so tightly that it whined in pain and tried to jump out of her arms . She crept into the room and tapped Shana gently on the shoulder . With the covers pulled up around her , her soft face on the pillow , she looked so young , so fragile , so untouched . Rolling over onto her back , she opened her eyes to her mother ,  | pushing herself up in the bed . Lily placed the puppy in her lap . " This is your new pal . What do you think ? " " Oh , how precious . What breed is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppy and held it to her face , nose to nose . " I love it . Oh , I love it . Is it a girl or a boy ? " Sitting on the edge of the bed , Lily answered , " It 's an Italian greyhound and a girl just like you . And you must name her . But first , throw on some clothes and come in for dinner . Dad 's got it all ready and it smells great . " Both Lily and Shana ate everything on their plates , taking seconds , leaving very little to John , who said he had eaten lunch and did n't mind . The puppy jumped around on the floor , squatting and making a puddle . " I brought all your new clothes over here from my house . They 're in the car , " Lily said after dinner as she carried the dinner dishes from the table and John planted himself in front of the television . " You can wear one of the new things to school tomorrow if you want . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked to see the child picking up the dishes off the table and walking to the sink . Shana never cleaned up of her own accord . Not without a fight . " Okay , " Shana said , looking at the puppy at her feet . " Let 's call her Princess Di , no , Lady Di . You know , like Lady and the Tramp and Princess Di ? Hey , Di . Come here , Di . Come to your mummy . Come here , little princess . " The dishes done , Lily and Shana went to her room for the remainder of the evening . After Lily helped her select an outfit for the next day , she sat behind her on the small bed and brushed her long hair . She tried to sense what her daughter was feeling . Finally , Lily dropped the brush and wrapped her arms around her . Shana 's head fell back into the crook of her mother 's neck . Lily lightly trailed her fingers over her brows , her eyelids , let them trace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were little , " she whispered , " I used to put you to sleep this way . Do you remember ? " " Yes , " she said softly .  | " Do you remember the Christmas when you found all the presents in the hall closet and unwrapped them and played with them and then put them back without anyone knowing ? I thought I 'd die laughing when I found out . You were such a case . " " Yes . " " How about the time when we went skating together and we skated into the boys ' bathroom by mistake and scared all those boys to death ? " " I remember . What about when Grandma went into the men 's room at the movie theater and we were too embarrassed to get her and sent the usher in ? Grandma could n't come out because her girdle got stuck and she was too nervous to get it up . That was funny . " " Yeah , " Lily said . But neither of them could laugh ; the laughter was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a foreign tongue they had once spoken fluently but no longer comprehended . " Can you sleep now ? " " No . " Lily left and returned a few minutes later with one of the sleeping pills they had given her at the hospital , handing it to Shana with a glass of water . " Do you want to sleep with me in our bed ? " After swallowing the pill , Shana pulled the puppy into the crook of her arm , rolled onto her side , and stared at the wall . " I 'll sleep here . " " You do n't have to go to school . I thought it would be a good way to get your mind off everything , but not if you ca n't handle it . " " I 'll be fine , Mom . " Kissing her before leaving , Lily whispered to the child , " Life goes on . That might not be the greatest thing I could say to you right now , but it 's a basic truth . " Lily went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed . She rolled over onto her back and stared at the ceiling . Her eyes shut and her body started falling  | into the blackness , but each time she fought it , springing back into consciousness , her eyes opening , seeking the familiar sights around her . She imagined she had a rope and she could tie it to the nightstand or the big green chair and then wrap it around her waist . Then she would not fall all the way down into the pit , then she would have a way to pull herself out again . He was dead , she was alive . Yet in the murky netherworld of dreams , he would never die . The door to Shana 's bedroom was open , and she heard John telling her good night , their voices muffled . Eyes on the ceiling , Lily heard him enter and softly close the door behind him . " Open the door , " Lily said . " I want to hear if Shana needs anything . " " I 'll open it in a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sleep on the sofa . " He paused , leaning against the door , his hands behind him , his voice low . " What do we do now ? " Lily rolled over onto her side and looked at him . " We go on living , John . What else can we do ? " " I mean about the police , about Shana , about us . " " The police will investigate , try to find him . Until they find him , nothing much will happen . " " I do n't know what to say to her , what to do . " " Do what you always do . Just be there for her and listen if she wants to talk . " Lily got up and went to the bathroom , thinking she must take off her clothes . John followed her . " Are you going to stay here ? What about the house you rented ? " He was standing close and Lily backed away . His breath , his clothes , even his hair , all reeked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , John . Shana would never feel safe there again . I 'll have to give it up . " She stepped into the bathroom and closed the door in his face . Letting her clothes fall in a heap on the floor , she put on his robe hanging on a hook . When she opened the door , he was still standing there . " You could move out . "  | His features became twisted with anger . " I 'm not moving out , " he snarled . " This is all your fault , you know . You even left the back door unlocked . That 's how he got in . " Her back stiffened and she felt the blood rush from her face . " Get out , " she snapped , trying to keep her voice down . " Leave me alone . " " I 'm not moving out . Do n't try to use this , Lily . I 'm staying here with my daughter . " " Then stay , " she said , disgusted . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , she needs me . She needs both of us . And your needs do n't mean shit right now , John . Nothing else matters . " He turned and started to leave the room . " Leave the door open , " Lily said . She rolled over onto her face on the bed , grabbing handfuls of white sheet in her fists , pulling them until the fitted corners lifted and the mattress was exposed . Sitting up , she yanked the sheet off , looking for the old stains , wanting to see them . In the center of her side of the bed was the reddish-brown circle where she had miscarried when Shana was only a few months old . It was all that remained of what should have been a brother or sister for Shana . If she had not miscarried , she would never have gone to law school and Shana would have never been raped . It was a spot of death , only a spot . She threw the sheet onto the floor and slept on the mattress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on . Soon she was walking in deep , dark water , up to her knees . It was splashing against her as she moved , her stride more like a march than a walk . As she walked , the water got deeper and deeper , but she could n't turn back . Far ahead , Shana stood , calling to her , her hair blowing straight out , her voice a crystal soprano . Lily 's eyes suddenly sprang open , her body bathed in sweat . She turned and saw Shana standing in the doorway . " My God , what happened . Are you all right ? " " I ca n't sleep , Mommy . I 'm so scared . " Her voice was small  | and cracking , the voice of a very young child . " He 's coming back . I know he 's coming back . " Lily patted a place next to her on the bed , and Shana walked over . " Sleep with me , sweetheart . " Once Shana was in bed , Lily turned off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you to listen to me and try to believe me . I know it 's hard , I know you 're afraid , but he 's never coming back . Do you hear me ? I promise you he 'll never hurt you again . " " You do n't know that  --  you ca n't promise me that . " Lily stared into the darkness . There was nothing more she could say . She 'd taken a life , committed the ultimate sin , and still there was nothing she could do to stop the pain .  | Waking long before the alarm clock went off , Lily panicked seeing Shana gone from the bed . She rushed to her room and found the door open , the room empty , but she heard noises in the kitchen . As she stood inside the room , she thought Shana must have risen hours before , for her room was spotless , everything in its place , every piece of clothing hung neatly on hangers . A coldness settled over Lily : she felt she was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to Shana , but were no longer infused with her presence . This was not her daughter 's room , this ordered perfection . She found Shana dressed , sitting at the kitchen table with schoolwork in front of her , her little puppy in her lap . Lily went to her and stroked her hair , placing her hands on her shoulders , peering down at the papers in front of her . " What time did you get up ? " " About four . I could n't sleep . " " Are you sure you want to go to school today ? " " I sure do n't want to stay here all day . But I do n't really want to leave Di either . " She paused . " I 'll go . "  | Later , as Lily drove her to school , she told Shana that she would have her new bedroom set with the canopy bed moved to her room in a day or so from the rental house . The bed where the rape occurred , Lily 's bed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shana looked at Lily with soft , dreamy eyes . " That would be nice , Mom . I really liked it . " John had left before Lily that morning and she had been forced to drive the Honda . As she approached the government center complex , her fingers tightened on the steering wheel . Perhaps they were waiting in the office with an arrest warrant and would cuff her and march her out in front of the entire staff . " Take me , " she said in defiance to the windshield . If not for Shana , she 'd welcome an end to the waiting , would accept the consequences of her actions . Then she would not have to perform , continue to function as if nothing had happened , constantly fear arrest . Then the tangled , twisted knot of horror and guilt might leave her . She rode the elevator up in silence , burst through the security doors , and hurried to her office , keeping her eyes on the floor , shutting out the chatter and ringing phones and printers spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and walked even faster , her heart racing , beating erratically as she listened , deep inside her own body . Her office was dark and the halls around it empty . She flicked on the light and tried to reassure herself with the sameness , checking her desk to see if anyone had been going through her papers and finding it all as she had left it . Letting her body sink in the upholstered desk chair , she felt momentarily safe . This was the place she loved , the work she lived for , her refuge . Here she was a respected professional . Here she was a righteous person . " Good morning , " Clinton said , strolling in energetically and taking a seat in front of her desk . " How 're you feeling ? Touch of the flu , huh ? He did n't know . Thank God , she thought . Clinton was one who could never keep knowledge under wraps . " I 'm fine today .  | I 'm just a little weak . " Say something else , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there completely naked , her victim 's blood dripping from her fingernails . " So , you 're getting quite an opportunity here . Even though you may only be acting supervisor of the Muni Division , it could lead to a permanent promotion later . Are you pleased ? " " Sure , but back to the same stupid cases , when I was finally getting something to sink my teeth into here . " He grimaced and then suddenly his face came alive ; he sat forward excitedly in his chair . " I almost forgot because it happened yesterday when you were off , but Hernandez got bumped off . Can you believe it ? " Clinton could be baiting her , she thought . He could even be a plant , wearing a wire . " Hernandez ? Which case is that ? " " The prostitute case . The one I dismissed the other day . Oxnard P.D . called me yesterday asking all about the case . They think it was a gang thing , a drive-by . Anyway , someone saved the taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripped the arms of her chair and tried to remain calm . They were asking questions about the Hernandez case , she thought , panicked . Clinton could have already told them that she 'd taken the file home with her and had it in her hands at the time Hernandez was murdered . What should she say now ? She felt her mind drifting off track and imagined them throwing a big party to celebrate all the salvaged taxpayers ' dollars , throwing confetti in the air while the Hernandez body rested on a slab in the center of the room . Seeing her glasses under a file folder where she had left them , she put them on and started to shuffle papers on her desk , moving them to one side and then back to the other . " The detectives are asking about the victim on that case . They tried to interview her and it 's pretty strange . She 's still missing . " As Clinton continued , Lily started tapping her pen on her desk frantically . She saw the expression on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hooker and she moved on .  | That 's not too unusual . " She knew her voice sounded annoyed , grating , taut . " Hey , I know you have a million things to do , " he said , standing to leave . " No , I 'm interested . Go on . . . finish what you were saying . " She placed her hands in her lap to keep them out of sight . " Well , seems like she left a couple of kids behind , little ones at that , and according to the detective , her sister said she was a pretty good mother . She did n't have any skills , and she started working the streets for the money , basically for the kids . So , they have n't heard word one from her . And get this , Hernandez was picked up on an arrest warrant four days after she filed charges . No one 's actually seen her since he was arrested . " The night of the rape was coming back in full force , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled the knife and his words : " Taste a fucking whore 's blood . " She pressed her hand to her cheekbone and held it there like a compress . " Does Oxnard think he might have murdered her to keep her from testifying ? Did they search his house for any evidence ? " The image of his house was in front of her , the sidewalk stained red with his blood . Had dogs licked her vomit from the asphalt , or had the crime-scene officers scraped it up and sent it to the lab ? Maybe the prostitute 's body had been cut up into pieces and they were locked inside that old refrigerator on the porch with the big padlock . " They work pretty slow over there , you know , with an average of three or four homicides a month , but I 'm sure they 're on top of it . They 've impounded his van and are going in all the right directions . Bruce Cunningham is handling the case . You 've heard of him . Pretty sharp man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was down the hall . She looked up to find Clinton staring at her . With a jerky movement of her hand , she hit the intercom . " Hold all my calls , Jan. "  | " You might have been right on this one from the start , Lily . I 've got to hand it to you . " " Keep me posted , Clinton . Get everything you have on this from Cunningham and let me see it . " Of all the detectives that could have received this case , it had to be this one , Lily thought , feeling her fear and panic escalate . He was the best detective in Oxnard , possibly in the entire county . She knew him  --  knew what made him tick . They had worked together several times in the past , and the man 's record was flawless . Taking a case that Cunningham had investigated to trial was an almost certain conviction . The man never erred , never rushed , never compromised his standards of excellence . He was a prosecutor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was her adversary . " This whole thing could be even bigger . I mean , I do n't want to get you all excited for nothing , but ... " Lily 's hands were locked on the edge of the desk , her body straining forward . " Spit it out , Clinton , " she said , unable to play out this scene any longer . " Well , Cunningham is tight-lipped right now  --  merely putting out feelers . Seems Hernandez and his brother were F.I . ' d a few months ago in the company of guess who ? Carmen Lopez , and get this , Navarro and Valdez . " Lily practically leaped out of her chair . It might mean the first real break in the McDonald  --  Lopez massacre , but it carried even more weight . It could be the taste of salvation . If Hernandez had killed the prostitute and orchestrated the slaughter of two others as well , he could be a multiple killer , a deadly psychopath . " I want Cunningham to report to me immediately on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want our own investigators apprised of this at once . Call and inform Butler and of course Fowler . Do n't let a word leak to the press . Got it ? " " Right , boss , " Clinton replied , feeling the same rush . At the door he turned , looking back at Lily . " You know , I did n't  | want to work for you . I thought you were going to be too tough , like , unreasonable . I was a damn fool . I 'd like to come back when manpower allows it . " She peered at him over the rim of her glasses . " Too tough , huh ? Not because I was a woman , because I was too tough . That 's a new one . You can come back , Clinton . Just keep using that conditioner on your hair . " He started laughing and Lily longed to catch the golden sound , steal it , and swallow it inside her . Only the corners of her lips rose and then fell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not hardly , " she replied , trying to crack her face with a bigger smile . Once he had left , she stood and walked around her desk in a circle , unable to sit still . She felt claustrophobic in the small office , but if she left , she would have to talk to more people , make polite conversation , listen to drivel . All she could think about was Cunningham , Cunningham , Cunningham . She kept repeating his name again and again . He was really quite well known , almost famous in a way in the legal community . The Owen case had made all the papers . How the man had managed to put together enough evidence to get a conviction without an actual body Lily could n't fathom . The woman could just walk in one day , alive . She was filled with abject fear . If he could put together a case like that , he was going to figure out that she killed Bobby Hernandez . Hernandez 's own brother had seen her . How could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get away with it ? She was living on borrowed time . Her actions had been sheer insanity . Suddenly , Richard was standing in her doorway , his brows knitted with concern , watching her pace . " I 've been calling you all morning , but Jan said you were n't taking any calls and then Clinton called and told me of the developments in McDonald  --  Lopez . Are you okay , Lily ? " She backed up , moving behind her desk , wanting something between them . " No , " she said . " I guess I 'm not , but I 'm work-  | ing on it . " He was a stranger from another time , another place , a part of someone else 's life . " Will you have a drink with me after work ? We can go somewhere quiet . " " I ca n't . I have to take my daughter to the psychologist . " He stood and crossed the room , taking one of Lily 's hands in his own . She let it lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you again ? I want to hold you , touch you . " Lily pulled her hand away . " I do n't know , " she said . " I just do n't know . " " You mean you do n't know when you can see me or you do n't know if you want to ? " " I 'm living at home right now . " She looked him in the eye . " I do n't know what 's going to happen . Right now I do n't know anything . " The phone rang and Lily grabbed it . Jan said she had Bruce Cunningham on the phone and asked Lily if she wanted to take the call . " I have to go , Richard . I 'll get back to you . " Once he had gone , Lily took a deep breath and pushed the flashing button . The detective started talking before Lily even answered . " Silverstein called me at home and started barking orders at me . Who is this guy and what makes you people think you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm sorry , Bruce . Accept my apology . Obviously , I know you 're on top of this . . . but . . . " She tried desperately to separate herself , not fall over her words , play the part . Like an animal , he would sense her fear . " This Lopez  --  McDonald case has everyone crazy over here . It 's one of those cases that grabs you . " " Yeah , " he said , the anger diffused . " Well , I 'll let you know the minute I have anything . The whole thing may be nothing . " She could tell he was getting ready to hang up . The words were in her throat , trapped there . Finally she spoke . " What do you actually have on Hernandez ? " " I thought I had something good , but it did n't work out .  | Neighbor got a plate . Swore she copied it down exactly right , but it came back to the wrong vehicle and a sixty-nine-yearold registered owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , for smacking noises came out over the line and pans rattled in the background . " We 've got a composite drawing of the suspect : white male , five-ten , thin , fair-skinned . Could be a professional hit . Never know . Looks like someone just did us a favor on that one . " " Thanks , Bruce , " Lily said . " Call us if anything new de-velops . " She hung up the phone in a daze . Some favor , she thought , wondering if people realized the meaning of their offhand comments . She visualized herself sitting on the floor in a circle with the big detective standing in the center like a schoolteacher . He would look over the heads of the children , saying : " Now , which one of you did us the favor of murdering the bad Mr. Hernandez ? " Lily would raise her hand proudly . She felt like she was losing her mind . Without the Magic Marker she would already be marching to a jail cell . They were looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . But Cunningham was smart , cunning , and she knew very well that he could be setting her up , having her followed , waiting for confirmation from the lab . She put her head in her hands , laced her fingers through her hair , and pulled as hard as she could . She was looking for the pain of reality , but she felt the nothingness of abstraction . When she removed her hands , sizable tufts of red hair were locked in her fingers .  | As they sat in the psychologist 's outer office , Lily reviewed a case she had brought along , while Shana thumbed through a magazine . A woman about Lily 's age walked out , and both Shana 's and Lily 's eyes glanced up at her , certain she was the doctor . Then a much younger woman appeared in the door and motioned for them to enter . She had soft brown eyes in a small , round face , and camel-colored hair to her shoulders . She was dressed in a calf-length floral skirt and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsha Lindstrom , Mrs. Forrester , and this must be Shana . " Lily stood and quickly shoved the case file into her open briefcase . " I thought you would be older , " she said without thinking . " Well , that 's a nice compliment . " She smiled at Shana . " Why do n't I talk to your mother first and you wait out here ? We wo n't be long . " Shana was standing and spoke up . " Why do n't you talk to both of us ? It happened to both of us . We were both there . " " That might be true , but sometimes people express them-  | selves better when they are alone . Just give us a few minutes , okay ? " Instead of an office , the woman led Lily to a room with a sofa , coffee table , and two large , overstuffed chairs . Lily had already had Ventura P.D . fax the woman a copy of the police report . With a clipboard in her hands , she started quizzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think any of this is relevant , " Lily stated , annoyed and restless . " I want you to counsel my daughter , not me . " " So you do n't believe you have suffered any personal trauma over this incident ? Is that correct ? " " I did n't say that . Sure , I 've suffered trauma , but I 'm used to it . " Lily paused , feeling trapped and stupid . Everything she said , everything she did came out wrong . Her control was slipping away . " What I mean is that ? " " Have you ever been raped before , Mrs. Forrester ? Lily ... can I call you Lily ? " The woman held her soft brown eyes on Lily 's face . Lily looked down at her loafers and white socks . She looked like a graduate student . She was too young . " What real difference does that make ? " The lights were low and soft guitar music played from hidden speakers . " I 'm an incest survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does . Is that what you wanted to hear ? " " Can you tell me how you feel about that . . . the incest ? " Lily had finally said the words to someone other than John , and the floodgates cranked open , releasing a torrent of emotions . It was another category , another title , she thought . District attorney , incest survivor , murderer . What else could she become : inmate , prisoner , jailbird ? She saw herself with a number across her chest , staring into the camera , heard the click of the shutter . " How do you think I feel ? " Lily stood and glared at the young woman . " Let me tell you how I feel . If someone ever tries to tell you that lightning does n't strike twice , tell them to fuck off . Now , call my daughter in here and see if you can help her . It 's too late for me. "  | Lily walked out the door and did n't look back . She took a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the poor woman was only trying to help . She just could n't deal with the incest now . It set her off , made her crazy . When Shana came out an hour later , Lily jumped up and knocked all the paperwork she had in her lap on the floor . " May I speak to you again ? " " Certainly , " Dr. Lindstrom stated calmly , " but my next appointment will be here soon . " When they were once again in the small room , Lily apologized for her earlier behavior . " I 'm sorry I was rude . I realize you 're only trying to help me , to do your job . The incest , well , it 's just too painful . I ca n't break myself open and bleed all over your carpet now . Do you understand ? Sometimes things go too far . Years ago , maybe . But now ? Now I have to focus my concern and strength on my daughter and not bring up things that will disturb me . " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lily heard her own breath seeping in and out of her mouth . Perhaps this woman would one day be called into court to testify on her behalf , telling the jury that she had killed a man because of the incest . Maybe she would state that she was cold and heartless , recite how she had refused professional help , stomped out of her office . " How do you think my daughter is handling this ? " " Remarkably well , at least on the surface . Her greatest concern appears to be the fear that people know about the rape . Your daughter is a very strong young woman , very determined , very controlled . " " Just that , " Lily said , leaning forward in her seat , " what you said about her being controlled . That 's not like Shana . She 's never been controlled . She 's always been spontaneous , almost a little erratic sometimes . And now she 's suddenly neater , quieter , more respectful . I 'm afraid she 's going to suppress all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe all of it surfacing when she 's a woman . "  | " Is that what happened to you ? " " I guess it did , " Lily said in a child 's voice . " One of my greatest concerns is my daughter 's sexuality and how this will affect her . She 's a beautiful young woman and I want her to have a complete life . " " Perhaps you should share your experiences with her . Tell her just what you told me . Give her a reason to work at therapy " " I ca n't , " Lily said , looking at the floor , then raising her eyes tentatively . " And I believe it 's the wrong thing to do . The world used to be a safe place for her and that 's gone . If I tell her what happened to me , then she 'll see even more danger , evil , menace . She 'll see it all around her . She needs to feel this was an isolated incident that seldom occurs and will never happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen twice in a person 's lifetime . " " But it can and it did in your case . Correct ? " " Correct . " Lily stared at her . " I 'm not telling her . " " That 's your decision . " " Lately , everything 's my decision . " " That appears to be the way you want it . Life is sometimes full of choices , decisions . You know , sometimes we end up with an unwelcome role in life , but it 's a role we 've selected . You do n't have to deal with everything alone . Even if you do n't feel you can talk to me , there are groups for incest survivors . But here again , it 's a choice you have to make . " As Lily walked out the door , she had a flash of herself standing over the car with the shotgun pointed at Hernandez . Was this really a choice she had made , to become an executioner ? Had she waited all these years for that moment , waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pent-up rage ? Or was this a role created for her alone at birth , her entire life leading to that one moment ? Did the universe prepare her by the earlier abuse to be a predator , to thin out the population of evil ? No , she thought , she had stepped off the edge of the  | world and fallen into the abyss , into the dark , tormented waters of the insane . " Mom , " Shana said , standing as her mother appeared , " what 's wrong ? " Lily was shivering , her arms wrapped around herself . " Nothing , " she said , " nothing at all . "  | The remainder of the week passed in slow motion . Days disappeared into sleepless nights , sleepless nights turned into blurry daylight , and Lily felt she was swimming the icy waters of the English Channel , pushing her body to perform , fighting the exhaustion , desperately trying to reach shore . She had to get her hands on the police report filed by Oxnard P.D . on the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly what evidence they had , to know where she really stood , and she had to see the composite drawing . She had instructed Clinton to order the reports , but they had never arrived . Clinton had taken over Richard 's unit , and Richard had moved into Carol Abrams 's old office . Everyone was buried in work , and the Hernandez murder was insignificant in itself and only of importance if he could be linked to the McDonald  --  Lopez case . Nothing further had developed on the missing prostitute . Everything was in limbo . Lily wanted to scream at Clinton to get the report , call and demand it from Cunningham , but she knew she would be a fool if she did so . That could be exactly what the detective was waiting for .  | Every day when she backed out of her garage , she searched the streets for unmarked surveillance vehicles , looked in her rearview mirror as she drove to work , and every night she sat in her house thinking they were out there somewhere , watching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John said at about four-thirty Saturday afternoon . " I thought I would tell you so you could make your own plans . " He had just come back from dropping off Shana at a friend 's house for a slumber party . Lily had case files spread out all over the oak dining room table . She had her hair in a ponytail , tied back with one of Shana 's " scrunchies , " as she called them , and was dressed in running shorts and a sweatshirt . " What does that mean  --  you 're going out ? " she said , removing her glasses and pushing the high-backed dining room chair away from the table . With no room in the house for a study , Lily had made a habit of working there : it afforded her more space than a desk . She had a classical tape in the stereo : Tchaikovsky 's Sixth Symphony . " Does that mean you have a date or something ? " " Let 's just say I 'm going out with a friend from the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't we ? " he said sarcastically . " As soon as you 're certain Shana is stable , you 're going to move out again . You know it and I know it . There is n't a life anymore for the two of us . " He walked over and turned the stereo down , as if the soft strains of classical music annoyed him . " You can stay here as long as you want , but I 'm going on with my life . I have a right to have a life too . " Looking deep into his soft brown eyes , she knew that he did n't love her anymore . The love had ended long ago . He needed someone who made him feel important , who was eager to listen to his stories , and who saw him as an attractive and desirable man . " Anyway , " he said , " you 'll have to get your own dinner . " His look was triumphant as he marched down the hall .  | Lily remained in the dining room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his " date . " The situation was becoming bizarre . Half an hour later , he came into the living room all decked out in one of his better suits , drenched in Drakkar cologne , making a point that she see him , and left , a lively bounce in his step . She had n't seen him walk that way in years . Early date , she thought , wondering where he was going and with whom , trying to imagine what the woman looked like and asking herself if they would kiss , even have sex . All these years he had shunned her and made her feel dirty about her sexuality . Who was this woman ? Some broken little girl he could comfort and protect ? Why did he have a right to go on with his life when her life was destroyed ? She should have stopped him , told him what she had done , sucked him into the nightmare . He should have been the one who avenged his daughter 's rape . She stood and shoved the papers onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the silent house , from room to room , peering through the blinds , through the cracks in the drapes , looking . Since she had forgotten all about lunch , her stomach was empty and turning , acid bubbling into her throat . She opened the refrigerator and found a piece of cheese , two slices of sandwich meat , and a foil-wrapped , driedup piece of leftover chicken . Slamming the door and grabbing her purse off the kitchen counter , she discovered that she had only three dollars in change . She had n't gone to the bank since the rape . Thinking she might find a few bills hidden inside the corner compartment of her checkbook , she pulled out the piece of paper with Richard 's phone number on it . On impulse she dialed the number . After two rings the machine picked up and a woman 's voice spoke on the recording . She immediately hung up , even though she was certain he had merely failed to change the recording after his wife had left . Lily flipped on the television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles had almost burned to the ground  | during the riots . Thousands of buildings and homes had been destroyed , and hundreds of people were injured or dead . It looked like a war zone . After fifteen minutes , she called Richard again , listened to his wife 's voice , and was about to hang up when he picked up , speaking over the recording , his own voice blending with the recorded voice of his wife . " Hold on , " he said . " I 've got to turn the machine off . " " It 's me , " Lily said , " your office partner . What 're you do-ing ? " " Well , you got me at a really bad time . You see , I have these twin nineteen-year-old blondes over here , and we 're about to get in the Jacuzzi . " " Sorry . I 'll see you at work Monday . Have a good time . " Lily believed him and felt humiliated . " Wait . That 's a joke . Actually , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the big decision . And what are you doing ? " " My husband has a date , " she said flatly , knowing how silly it sounded , yet needing to talk with someone . " Well , is n't that just special ? I think that 's about the best thing he could do , if you ask me . Now , why do n't you get in your little red car and head my way ? Can you find the house if I give you the address again ? " " I think I can , " she said , wanting to run out the door and leave the empty house behind . " All you have to do is get here . I 'll take care of the rest . How long will it take ? " He was anxious and it showed . " Let 's say an hour . " " See how easy this New Age living is . Now you have a date too . The Ozzie and Harriet days were n't really any fun , anyway , were they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I should n't come , Richard . I may ruin your evening . " The lightness disappeared and his voice lowered . He uttered only one word : " Come . " The sun was going down , and dark shadows were lurking  | in the corners of the empty room , marching toward her . " I 'm coming . Right now . " " I 'm waiting . " Lily hung up and , grabbing her parka draped over a kitchen chair , rushed from the house . She had not showered , her hair was unwashed and her face bare of makeup . As she drove , she watched the cars around her , behind her , weaving through side streets so that ' no one could follow her . When she arrived , after getting lost in the narrow , steep hills leading to his house and after huffing and puffing up the eighteen steps leading to his door , she started to turn and leave . You were an idiot to come here , she told herself . Standing on the doorstep , she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . She released her hair from the ponytail and shook it free . She grabbed her compact from her purse and glanced at her face . Finally she rang the doorbell , standing there like a waif , her bare legs freezing . As he flung open the door , his eyes registered shock at her appearance . Then he reached for her and held her in his arms . " My God , what 're you wearing shorts for this late in the evening ? You 'll catch pneumonia . Come in . Come in . " He moved his arm , directing her into the living room and made a little bow like a headwaiter . The house was now fully furnished , with lots of black marble and shiny , uncluttered surfaces . The lights were low and the stereo playing " Unforgettable " by Nat King and Natalie Cole . Lights were twinkling in the picture window overlooking the city . The dining table was set . Two candles in silver holders were the only lights in the room . " I bought tequila and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an excellent bottle of champagne . What will it be ? " He was dressed neatly in slacks and a sweater , and the familiar lime scent drifted to her nostrils . She felt smelly and disgusting , like she 'd been living on the streets , like a homeless person . " Maybe a bath or a shower ? "  | " Sure . No problem . Here 's the plan . You take a shower and I 'll start dinner . " Lily let the hot water cascade over her head . She washed her hair with Richard 's shampoo and dried herself with Rich-ard 's towel . She sprayed her underarms with Richard 's deodorant . Then she saw the bottle of lime cologne and poured some onto her hands and touched her body with it . She was safe here among Richard 's possessions , in his home . Here no one could touch her . Wrapping herself in his big , fluffy bathrobe , she padded barefoot into the living room . They sat side by side on the sofa facing the floor-to-ceiling glass windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started a small fire in the fireplace . Lily asked to use his phone and left his number at the house where Shana was spending the night . He wanted to know how the girl was doing . " It 's funny , but she 's doing fine . She saw the psychologist again yesterday , and the doctor feels she 's handling everything remarkably well  --  on the surface , anyway . " " Kids are survivors , Lily . They 're much stronger than we think . " " But she 's different , Rich . She 's quieter , neater , more helpful around the house . I do n't know . Something so terrible ca n't have a positive effect . I keep thinking these are all indicators that she 's more deeply disturbed than anyone thinks . " As Lily took a sip of the champagne , concern etched itself in her face , causing her brows to knit . " Sometimes when a tragedy occurs , in anyone 's life , at any age , it makes them more aware of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't respond but got lost in her thoughts . What if Shana thought this terrible thing had happened because she was a bad person , and by trying so hard now to be good , she was trying to protect herself , redeem herself , so to speak ? Lily decided to discuss this with the psychologist next week . Then  | she realized Richard had just been sitting there , and she felt a flush of appreciation for his silence . " Why do n't I serve dinner while you relax by the fire ? Are you hungry ? " " Starving , " she said . " You did n't make it yourself , did you ? " She did n't want Richard to have any domestic skills at all , not like John . That she could n't handle . " No , but I know how to reheat it . The restaurant even wrote it down on a little card . " He smiled and left the room . After a candlelight dinner of roast duck in orange sauce , which was excellent and prepared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , he put a Nat King Cole record on the stereo and they danced by the fire , their feet barely moving , his arms loose around her waist . " Did I tell you that you look absolutely gorgeous tonight ? I 've never seen you like this , " he said . Lily was embarrassed , knowing he was lying , trying to make her feel good . Without makeup she felt naked , exposed , homely . He placed his large hands on her back , letting them slide down to her ass , pressing her tightly against him . Lily pulled back , seeing where it was heading . She took his hand and led him to the sofa . " Tell me about yourself , " Lily said . " You know , the real stuff , not the stuff I already know . " " Let 's see . I grew up here in Santa Barbara , a spoiled rich kid . My parents owned a house right across from the beach , but we seldom went on it . Funny , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a surgeon , and his father was a surgeon , but I did n't have the inclination or the aptitude to follow in their footsteps . " " Was it a disappointment to him ? " she asked , comparing her own past to his , wondering what it would be like to have no greater trauma buried there than simply not having an aptitude for surgery . " No doubt . But he handled it well . I was on the swim team  | and made decent grades . He was n't unhappy when I went into law . He viewed it as a respectable profession . " He stopped and a glint of moisture appeared in his eyes . " He died two years ago . My mother moved to Florida . I have a brother in Pasadena , also a surgeon . That 's about it . " " How 's your son ? Greg , right ? " " Still surfing . His hair 's so long now that he looks like a girl , but we 're getting along pretty good . We see each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to move in with me . Who knows ? He 's a good kid . " They were sitting close now , staring at the fire . He suddenly stood and took her hand . " I 'd like to take you in the bedroom and hold you . I do n't expect you to have sex with me , but I 'd like to hold you in my arms . " In the bedroom , Lily slipped off the robe and let it fall to the floor . He removed his clothes and tossed them onto a chair . They got under the covers and held each other , pressing their naked bodies together , not saying a word . The warmth of his body , his strong arms around her , made her want to stay there forever . After a while he began stroking her lightly with a feather touch , using the soft , padded tips of his fingers . Soon his hands were between her legs , but only so softly , barely touching her . She moved his hand away . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breathing heavily and reached for her breasts . Leaping from the bed , she grabbed his robe and placed it in front of her . She backed to the wall , standing next to his chest of drawers . " Lily , " he said , sitting up . " What 's wrong ? " Her chest was rising and falling rapidly , and she could n't speak . Her skin felt cold and clammy . He got up and came to her , wrapping her in his arms . " Do n't , " she said , pushing him away from her with both hands . " I 'm sorry . " His shoulders drooped and he sat on the edge of the bed ,  | his head in his hands . " It 's all my fault , " he said . " I just wanted to hold you , but I got carried away . " Lily slipped on the robe and tied it around her . She left the bedroom and headed for the living room . Richard followed , wearing only his pants . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stared at the fire . He sat down next to her and put his hands on her shoulders , gently turning her to face him . " I was wrong . I pushed you . Please forgive me . " She looked into his eyes . " There 's nothing to forgive . " " Lily , I can wait . Do you hear me ? I can wait . However long it takes you , I 'll wait . I want it to be like it was before . " " It may never be like it was before . " As she said the words , tears began falling down her cheeks . He took her head and placed it on his shoulder . " Yes , it will , Lily . We found each other after half a lifetime . There was something wonderful there , beyond the sex . It 's just too soon . I should have known . " " You do n't even know me . " " I know you enough that I want to marry you . I 've watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with you for years . " She broke away and stood , walking to stand in front of the fireplace , her back turned . " Do you know what it means to be sexually dysfunctional ? " " Certainly I know what that means . But you 're not sexually dysfunctional . My wife might fit that description , but you 're a perfectly normal woman with normal desires . You 've just suffered through a rape and it 's too soon . That 's all . " She turned and faced him . " Maybe there was more than just the rape , Richard . " Now , an inner voice screamed . Tell him now . He 's not weak like John . Tell him . But the words were locked inside , the key lost . " What are you trying to tell me ? Just tell me one thing . Do you care about me ? "  | " Yes . " " Then that 's all that matters . I 'm going to marry you . And you 're going to be happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she could only believe him , delude herself into thinking it could actually happen . Maybe they would never find out , and she could suppress it all like the incest . She had to get back to the place she had been before , had to find the road back . She told him , in a voice so low it was almost inaudible , " I want you . " She turned and walked back into the bedroom . No one was going to take this away from her . She untied her robe and let it fall to the floor . There was no past , no memories , no fears . There was only this moment . Tomorrow or the next day they might come and arrest her . She wanted to live first , wanted to taste his love one last time . She was a condemned prisoner sitting down to her last meal . Under the covers again with Richard beside her , she moved against his body . He did n't reach for her or stroke her , but he became aroused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he entered her . Only their connected hips moved back and forth in a slow , unhurried motion , more like a dance than the hungry sex they had experienced before . Lily felt the pleasure begin somewhere in her toes and creep up to her genitals and then her breasts , hitting her brain like a shot of heroin and washing away the pain . She moaned , but he did not stop and did not speed up . Then , with his hands on her ass , he pushed into her deeply for the first time and his body trembled . He did not cry out . His lips next to her , he whispered , " I love you , Lily . " And she knew it was the truth , for she felt the same . " I 'm in love with you too , Richard , " she said , the words bringing tears to her eyes and profound sadness . It was all just an illusion , a mirage . " I 'm going to love you for the rest of your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it takes , and whatever it takes , we 're going to make it work . " She took the words , the smells , the feelings , and tried to enlarge them inside her mind . She saw a photo album , the pages all empty , and saw herself carefully inserting these images underneath the plastic , filling the album . Then she saw the last page . On the last page was a bloody , disfigured corpse , but it was n't Hernandez , it was her . He rolled onto his back , and Lily sat up on the bed . Then she ran to the bathroom and closed the door , falling to her knees and vomiting into the commode . Richard tapped at the closed door . " Let me in . Let me help you . " It sounded as if he was leaning against the door , his voice only inches away . " Please , " she said . " Please do n't come in . " She flushed the toilet and washed her mouth in the sink . Finding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to find him sitting on the edge of the bed , still naked . He stood and she started backing out of the room . Each step he took forward , she moved backward . " Do n't love me , Richard . There 's nothing to love . Nothing . Do you hear me ? " " Lily , please , " he pleaded . She turned and ran out of the front door , down the steps to her car , looking back at the house as she drove off . Heading down the steep , winding roads , she floored the Honda and drove as though the hounds of Hell were yapping at her feet . The road in front of her was a blur as tears filled her eyes and spilled onto her face . She had no right to happiness , she told herself . No right to pleasure . After thirty minutes , she found herself on 3rd Street in Oxnard , slamming on her brakes in front of Hernandez 's house . She stared at the front of it , watched as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze in the broken window . She saw herself walking in the door and entering the house , finding his bed and sleeping in it , waking to  | search his room until she found the red sweatshirt and pulling it over her head . Then she would walk out the front door and spread her arms while bullets tore her flesh and her blood pumped on the pavement . They were locked in an eternal dance , she thought , a bride and groom . When she 'd pulled the trigger that morning , the vows had been sealed , the books inscribed . His soul was free , his sins washed clean in blood . She had been left to stand forever at the altar . With the back of her hand , she wiped her wet face and runny nose , slowly pulling the car away from the curb . Her head fell back and a great hacking noise rose from her chest and echoed off the windows and steel of the car . Laughter . She was laughing . A shotgun wedding , she thought , spewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shotgun wedding .  | The phone rang in the darkened bedroom , and at first Lily thought it was the alarm clock . She had been in a deep sleep , the black-out drapes blocking the morning sun . It was Shana . " Can you come and get me , Mom ? I 'm ready to come home , " she said . Lily sat up in bed and looked around the room for John , but he was not there and his side of the bed looked undisturbed . Somehow she had forgotten that they no longer slept together , and everything that had happened seemed like a dream . He was probably on the sofa and had not heard the phone . " What time is it ? " she asked . " It 's only seven-thirty , but I 'm ready to come home . Sorry I woke you . Where 's Dad ? Did he feed Di today ? " " I do n't know ... maybe he went out for breakfast . Give me the address and directions , and I 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up , concern began to rise . Slumber parties almost always lasted until ten or eleven in the morning , the girls staying up late and sleeping late , waking to donuts  | and milk provided by the parents . In the past Shana had been the last to leave , since the girl who had hosted the party always begged her to stay over far into the day . As Lily dug in the bottom of her closet and pulled out a pair of rumpled jeans , which she shook to make them somewhat presentable , it dawned on her that her closet was now in worse shape than her daughter 's . Looking for some type of top and seeing nothing but dirty laundry , she decided to try Shana 's closet . She walked into the room wearing jeans and her bra . John was asleep in Shana 's small bed , his suit , shirt , and tie from the night before flung over a chair . Shana 's little puppy was curled up at the foot of her bed . So , this is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John was going forward with his life ? while she was sinking deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit . She resisted the urge to kick him , pull the few strands of hair on his head , do anything to inflict pain . Picking up his shirt , she held it to her nose and sniffed it , trying to catch a whiff of perfume , thinking she could then picture the woman he 'd been with . She let it fall to the floor , realizing that it did n't matter . As she grabbed a sweatshirt from a stack of freshly washed and folded clothes Shana had stacked on top of her dresser , the thought crossed her mind that she 'd probably seen John sleeping more than she 'd ever seen him awake during the course of their marriage . When he was awake , he was n't much different from when he was sleeping anyway . She saw Shana sitting on the front step of the girl 's house as soon as she drove up . She hurried to the car , carrying her sleeping bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front . Her hair was uncombed and she looked tired . " Is something wrong ? " Lily asked . " Why did you want to come home so early ? " Shana reached into her purse and , taking out her brush , started brushing her hair in the visor mirror . " It 's just a bunch of baby stuff . All they do is giggle and act like monkeys . "  | Shana then pulled out a tube of lipstick , tangerine pink , and carefully applied it to her lips . Satisfied , she pulled the visor down and looked at her mother . " I want to change schools . I 'm sick of this school and the same kids . I 've known them all since the first grade . " " Shana , there 's only one junior high in Camarillo and you know that . If you tough it out one more year , you 'll be in high school and several junior highs feed into that school , so there 'll be a lot of new faces . " Lily suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact she 'd feared all along . " Shana , has anyone said anything to you . . . you know . . . about what happened ? " " No , " her daughter said and her eyes clouded over . They were stopped at a light and Lily faced her . " Are you telling me the truth ? " she asked . " Of course I am , Mom . No one has said anything and I have n't told anyone either . " She was n't angry that Lily had doubted her , which was out of character . " I 've been thinking a lot , and I know you are going to move out again . " Lily started to reassure her that she would n't leave , but Shana stopped her as her mouth opened . " Just listen , okay . I want to move out with you . We could get a place in Ventura , not that place for sure , but another place , and then I could go to Ventura High School . They start in the ninth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be rad . " Lily took a deep breath , not believing her ears . It was all she had ever hoped for and could solve everything . " What about your dad ? I thought you did n't want to leave him . " " Oh , he 'll be fine . He has a girlfriend , you know . " She caught herself for a moment , putting a hand over her mouth . " I should n't have said anything . I promised him I would n't . " They arrived at the house . Lily opened the garage door and saw that John 's white Jeep was gone . " I knew anyway . He went on a date last night . " She thought of herself and Richard , wondering how she could face him at the office after  | last night , knowing she had no right to criticize John 's behavior . " He has every right to go out . We were separated and planning to divorce , so ... " Tossing her sleeping bag in a corner in the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go to another slumber party in her life , Shana followed her mother into the kitchen . She grabbed a banana , peeled it , and with her other hand started picking food particles out of the cracks in the brown kitchen counter tile . Then she went to her room and came back with her puppy Di in her hands and held her while they talked . " He 's had this girlfriend for a long time , Mom . I know , I 've heard him talking to her a lot of nights when you worked late . Sometimes a woman would even call the house and I picked up the phone . Then he up and told me the other day . " She started eating the banana , her sapphire eyes bright and wide . " Just ca n't imagine of Dad making out with some woman . If you move out and I stay , this lady will be over here all the time . It makes me sick . " She set the puppy on the floor and watched as it scurried off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting to wait for it to perk , she stuck her coffee cup under the drip pan and removed the pot . Coffee started leaking out onto the counter , and she mopped it up with a paper towel . Shana tossed the banana peel under the sink in the trash can and picked up a sponge and began cleaning the counter . " But what if I want to see someone . . . you know , a man ... go on a date ? Is that going to make you sick too ? " Lily said the words but did n't envision it actually occurring after the night before . All the same , the revelation that John had been seeing someone for some time made her wish that she had given him a swift kick that morning . All the guilt he 'd laid on her and he had been carrying on behind her back . She promised herself that she would follow him and spy on him the next time he went out , give him a dose of his own medicine . Shana tossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dad 's gon na be dating . . . you 're gon na be dating . . . shit . . . guess I 'll start dating too . We 'll be the dating family . " Shana never used profanity . Thinking she was upset , Lily said , " We 're all only human . Everyone needs someone in their life , even if it 's just for friendship 's sake . " " I 'm not angry , Mom , " she said , smiling . She even walked over and hugged Lily from behind around the waist . " You 're pretty , Mom , real pretty , and you 're a lot younger than Dad . " Lily turned to face her and her eyebrows arched and her eyes sparkled . " All the guys are gon na want to go out with you . I just know Dad 's going to bring some boring old lady over here and she 's gon na try to be my mom . Besides , Dad babies me to death . He 's always hanging on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little kid , his baby doll or something . " She grimaced . " I ca n't stand it . I 'm not a baby anymore . " She looked Lily straight in the eye . More was said with that look between them than words could ever say . Lily knew exactly what she was feeling , knew it would be a long time before she would be comfortable with any man , even her father . Even though she was certain that John 's behavior was just fatherly love and nothing inappropriate , she knew Shana could n't tolerate it any longer . " No , you 're not a baby anymore , Shana . You 're a bona fide young woman . " Lily felt tears about to fall . She placed one finger under each eye in an attempt to hold them back . " I 'm really , really happy that you want to live with me . I 'll do my very best to make you happy . " " Ventura is so cool , Mom , with the beach and all . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . Okay ? " Thinking of Richard and the cool breezes and towering trees in the foothills , the feeling she got when she 'd been there of being far removed from the city below , Lily knew just where she wanted to look . " Your dad will have to sell this house . I do n't think he can afford it without my salary . "  | " So , why does he need such a big place ? What 's he gon na do anyway ? Let his girlfriend move in here . I do n't want to move back here , not ever . " Lily opened her arms and Shana walked into them . " I love you so much , " she said , holding her tightly . " Just your saying that you want to live with me , well , it 's all I ever hoped for . You ca n't possibly know how much I needed to hear this . " Shana pulled back and brushed her mother 's hair off her face . " I know a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great . Just you wait and see . "  | Sunday was visiting day at the Ventura County Jail , and Manny Hernandez was standing in a long line , waiting to sign in , have the metal detector waved over his body and be patted down by one of the jailers . Thursday they had buried his brother . Not much of a funeral , and even that cost enough that his father had to get a loan at the produce company where he worked . Their mother had split years ago , when Manny was a baby and Bobby about six years old . Finally getting into the visiting area , Manny took a seat in one of the cubicles and picked up the phone to speak with the inmate , while they looked at each other 's faces through the thick glass . The prisoner started jabbering in Spanish . " I du n no what you 're fucking saying , bro , " Manny said . The man knew he did n't understand Spanish but was always forgetting . His father knew only a few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You not ' spose to be here , man . Like they check the signin to see who 's comin ' in here to see who . " " My brother is fucking dead an ' the cops are all over my  | ass . Someways they found out ' bout Carmen . It 's bad shit , man . Bad shit . You heard ? " " I hear . " The man 's face twisted with menace and rage , threatening . " I hear you fucking sleepin ' with the cops , man . You gon na be dead meat . That 's what I hear . " Manny got up to leave . " I do n't got to take shit from no one , " he yelled . The man behind the glass stood and put both his palms on the window , jerking his head for Manny to return . Manny took his time , shuffling his feet . Then he picked up the phone again . " You ai n't heard nuthin " bout what I say . Not saying shit , man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ask ' round . Some skinny white guy blowed Bobby away and I want his ass , you hear me ? That man 's dead I find him . Dead . You get the word or you 'll hear plenty . " Manny threw the phone receiver in the metal bin used to pass papers and things to the inmates . The noise was loud enough to attract the attention of the jailer . He was around the corner in seconds . " Dropped it , man , " Manny said , holding his hands up as though he were under arrest and to show he was n't concealing anything . " Just dropped it , man . " With that , he left . When Manny pulled up to his house , he saw an unmarked police unit at the curb and Cunningham motioning for him to come over . " Motherfucking detective , " he yelled , squeezing his fingers on the steering wheel until the knuckles turned white . " Making my skin crawl . Everywhere I go , every time I take a piss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he walked to the police unit and stuck his head in the passenger window . " What you want now ? It 's Sunday , man . I just got back from mass for my brother . You harassing me , comin ' here all the time . " Cunningham sneered , flicking the ends of his mustache with his fingers . " And who are you going to complain to , Manny , my boy ? Just who is going to be real concerned about me harassing you ? The chief maybe , or the mayor ? "  | " So whatta you want now ? Wan na smell my dick and see if I took a piss today ? " " You lied to me about Carmen Lopez , and you ca n't imagine what it does to me when people lie to me . " Cunningham reached inside his sharkskin suit and pulled out the .38 Smith &; Wesson he carried there . He held the gun in his hands and played with it , checking the chamber , taking the edge of his jacket and wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied to by jack shits like you . You said you had never seen Carmen before that night and only picked her up for a cruise . Well , that was n't true , was it ? " Manny started blinking . Sweat became visible on his brow and upper lip . He slapped the top of the patrol car with his palms . " So I was with her a few times ' fore she moved . Lotsa guys were with her . That ai n't no crime . " " Word is that Bobby was hot for her  --  real hot for her ? and maybe he got real pissed when she decided to clean up her act and started dating a high school guy . " Cunningham replaced the gun in the shoulder holster . " Fuck you , " Manny said . " Bobby 's dead and she 's dead . They got the guys who wasted her . Why do n't you fucking find the guy who killed my brother ? Fuck you . " Manny turned and went into the house . He knew even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting heavy , real heavy , and Manny was getting scared .  | The line at In-n-Out Burgers was about twelve cars deep , but Cunningham did n't care . Sunday night was diet night at his house , and he made it a habit to eat out instead of going home as he normally did . His wife , Sharon , as well as all three of their kids , had a tendency to gain weight , so diet night consisted of plain chicken breasts cooked on the grill , with salad and a baked potato without butter . Just thinking of those little dry pieces of meat made him want to gag . His mouth was watering and his stomach roaring for a double-double with cheese and an order of fresh-cooked fries . While waiting in line , he reviewed all the information he had collected . As far as a lead on the homicide of Bobby Hernandez , he had little or nothing . When one of the little Mexican ladies on the block had called the station and advised a Spanish-speaking officer that she had copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd known right away that it was too good to be true . She insisted that the plate was correct , saying she 'd checked it several times while the car was parked right in front of her house , a few doors down from the murder  | scene . Said she got up early to go to work , and her kitchen window looked onto the street . Seeing the car there , parked with the engine running , she smelled trouble and wrote down the license plate just in case . But the lead went nowhere . So far everything had been a dead end . Even the National Crime Information Center in Washington , where he had faxed the composite , and the FBI had no one who was a close enough match to follow through on . He had a make on the weapon and two slug casings from the scene , but no prints and no weapon . He 'd played with the thought of a professional hit , but there was nothing to substantiate it . A professional would have known the first shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension , to fire again . Also , the Hernandez brothers were just not big enough at anything , and in Oxnard , if you wanted somebody dead , it could be had for as little as five hundred bucks and you 'd have your choice of shooters . They might not be pros , but they 'd stand in line for the job . The only thing that crossed his mind was the boy who had been murdered with Carmen Lopez , Peter McDonald . If the Hernandez brothers had committed that crime and the family had learned the truth without reporting it , possibly they could have hired someone to murder Hernandez , or even one of the family members themselves had sought revenge . The compact car and the fact that the killer was distinctly Anglo could support such a premise . He finally made it through the line and got his little sack containing his double-double and fries . He parked and popped the can on his diet soda , purchased at Stop ' n ' Go earlier . He liked to save pennies whenever possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a mental note to call the detectives handling the Lopez  --  McDonald murders in the morning and find out what he could on the McDonald family . Officially it was not his case , occurring about twenty minutes away in Ventura , but no one would mind , not one little bit , if he could put something together on this baby . And  | Manny Hernandez was dirty , as dirty as they come . Not only that , he thought , he was running scared , real scared . One thing Cunningham had a righteous nose for was fear , and he could smell Manny a city block away . As far as the disappearance of Patricia Barnes , the fat hooker that Hernandez had been dismissed of trying to rape and kidnap , there were no leads whatsoever . No body had been found , even unidentified , and he had checked the entire state . The van had turned up hairs matching those on one of her brushes supplied by her sister , but they already knew she 'd been in the van . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van or the house that could suggest a murder . Barnes more than likely would waltz in one day in a month or a year and claim her kids . She probably just took a hike . Of course , she could be buried somewhere and her body might never be found . Old Ethel Owen was still out there somewhere . Never know , he thought . That was another benefit of the job : suspense . He thrived on it . Back at the station , he went to the records counter and seeing Melissa , he smiled , relieved that the bitch was off today . " God , Melissa , " he said across the counter , " I 'm stuffed like a pig . " He extended his stomach and opened his jacket to prove it . " Want me to get you something to eat ? " Melissa placed her cigarette on the edge of the ashtray and sneered at Cunningham . " Thanks but no thanks , " she said , bending back down over whatever she was working on and ignoring him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calluses on her right thumb from writing . She was the best damn worker in the department . The only problem was the girl weighed only about eighty-five pounds dripping wet . She was either anorexic or on speed . No one had figured out which , and everyone wondered . Melissa 's father was an ancient , decaying ex-Hell 's Angel , crippled now and in a wheelchair with some rare illness stemming from years of drug abuse . For such a low-life background , the young woman made every attempt to present herself with  | a degree of class . She wore inexpensive but stylish clothes and wore her dark hair swept back in a sleek knot at the base of her neck . Lately she had become so emaciated that she had to sit on a pillow , no flesh whatsoever on her tailbone . " Melissa darling , " he said , " I have a little project for you and only you . You know you 're the best there is in my eyes . " She did n't smile , but she did get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette smoldering in the ashtray . Being sweet-talked was old hat , as she did extra work for half the department . The calluses came from writing patrol officers ' reports from their own scribbled notes when they were too lazy to write them . " I have this murder case with nothing , absolutely nothing , " he said . " All I have is this license number , and it 's got to be an error . " She looked up at him with her big , soulful eyes and waited for him to fish the number out of his file . " So , you want me to run it with every possible combination . What are we looking for exactly ? " " We 're looking for a compact car , red , and I 'll take anything with a registered owner in the local area , say a radius of fifty miles or so . Then run D.M.V. for the owner and if it looks even halfway possible , let me see it . Also , check all combinations on anything stolen in the past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce . That 's how long it 's going to take for this little job . " She took the paper and returned to her desk , slipping it under her desk blotter . She might act annoyed , but he knew she loved these kinds of projects . Pity , he thought , navigating his big frame down the hall to the detective bureau . She would 've probably made the best cop the department had ever seen , but there were n't that many that weighed only eightyfive pounds , not yet anyway . Just then a little man in uniform passed him and he shook his head . As hard as he tried , he just could n't get used to the munchkins , as he called them . When he had entered this line of work , it had been a world of giants ,  | jock straps , and balls . They were all big and brave then , the town heroes . Now it was midgets , in more than physical stature , men and women who had to resort to brutality and force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few L.A. cops , and a population that was morally bankrupt , half the city had been burned down in the riots , and thousands of people were homeless and out of work . Shit like this just did n't happen in Omaha . There was crime , but what was going on around here was madness , moral decay , the end of the line . People were becoming desperate . They had no heroes , no warriors , no protectors , no one left to draw the line . When the cops did n't even know who the good guys were anymore , it was a sad day to be sure . Yep , he thought , dropping into his chair and swinging his feet on top of the desk , the job just was n't the same anymore . Trouble was , the fucking world just was n't the same anymore . Might be was too late , he told himself , before he too was sucked into the sewer with the rest of the rats .  | After spending the afternoon looking at houses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie at her insistence . In the dark theater , she sat and stared at the screen , unable to follow the film . Once they were home and Shana in her room with the door shut , she asked John to discuss something with her in the backyard . The back door creaked on its hinges as John stepped outside . Lily was sitting in the dark , waiting . There was a full moon and she could see him clearly , her eyes tracking him until he made himself comfortable in the lounge chair . " So what do you want to talk about ? " he said , stretching and yawning . She sprang from the chair , stood over him , and brought her hand across his face as hard as she could , listening to the loud slap . " You had the unmitigated gall to hit me and order me to move out of this house when it was you . . . you 're the one who has been cheating behind my back . If it was n't for Shana , I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear me ? "  | " I hear you , " he said , standing and starting to return to the house . Lily grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled it . " Do n't you dare walk away . . . do n't you dare . If you had n't forced me to move out , Shana would 've never been raped and I would never be living this nightmare . You 're the one responsible , not me . " Once she let go of his shirt , he faced her , moonlight reflecting off the whites of his eyes . " And you , you 're going to look me in the eye and tell me that the other night was the first time you ever cheated on me . What do you take me for , a fool ? You 're a slut . You 've always been a slut . You may be a hot-shot attorney , but you 're nothing but a slut . " The back door of the neighbors ' house opened , and both Lily and John turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now the whole neighborhood is going to know what 's going on in this house . " Lily felt his warm breath on her face . " Just tell me one thing , John . How can I be a slut when I 've only slept with a few men in my life and one of them raped me ? " " You know what I think ? I think you just fabricated that whole stupid story about your grandfather to cover up the fact that you were n't a virgin . I 've always thought that . " She was stunned . Letting her body drop to the lawn chair , she laced her fingers through her hair and stared at the ground . She was n't married to this man , she told herself . There was no way she could have lived all these years with this man , slept in his bed , shared his life , given birth to his child . She listened as he entered the house and shut the door behind him . The train had finally derailed and the cars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staying in the chair until the night air burrowed deep in her bones , she looked at the moon and the stars and tried to imagine herself floating there in the dark serenity , far away . Then she walked to the back door and turned the knob . After a few moments of fiddling with it , she realized it was locked .  | She started beating on the door with her fists and kicking the wood with her feet . " Is there anything I can do ? " a familiar voice said in the dark . Lily looked over her shoulder and saw her neighbor peering over the top of the fence . " No , Ruth , " she said to the woman , " the door 's just stuck . I 'll go around to the front . Thanks anyway . " Waiting until the woman disappeared , she walked in the moist grass and tried the front door and found it also locked . Finally she discovered a cracked window , removed the screen , and climbed in . All the lights were turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no energy left in her body to continue the fight . She felt small and frail , invisible ; she felt erased . Taking a pillow and blanket from the linen closet , she curled up on the sofa . " One one-thousand , two one-thousand , three one-thousand , " she counted . About to leave for the day , early , due to their appointments at the Ventura Police Department to look at photo lineups of possible suspects in the rape , Lily punched the hands-free button on the speaker phone for what had to be her last call . She had n't arrived at the office until almost noon , waking late in the morning on the sofa in the empty house , and she was now trying to wade through the deep pile of cases on her desk and make one last assignment before leaving . The deep voice of Bruce Cunningham was recognizable without introduction . " Thought I would let you know what 's going on , " he said hurriedly , excitedly . " I 'm heading out now to Moorpark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the description of Patricia Barnes . Seems they were bulldozing for a new housing tract and spotted a leg or something after the first level of dirt had been removed . " Lily slammed back so hard and fast in her chair that it slipped backward on the plastic mat . She pushed herself to the desk with the heels of her shoes and grabbed the receiver . " I 'll  | get one of our investigators over there too , " she said . " I want one of our men present when the body is exhumed . " She then added quickly , " If you get there before he does , try to preserve the crime scene before they destroy it . " Wanting to have him call her at the police station , she hesitated , not willing to disclose her reasons for being there . " Let me give you my home number . Call me around six-thirty or seven . I should be home by then . " She rattled off her number and disconnected , swearing she would purchase a cellular phone , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was get into her car and go to Moorpark , actually be where she could feast her eyes on death brought about by Hernandez . She wanted to smell the putrid odor , lean over the grave and take the cold , lifeless hand and hold it in her own , seal in her mind the bond they had , both of them victims , sisters . Then perhaps she could exonerate herself , free herself from this nightmare of guilt . But Shana was waiting and the fact that Hernandez had murdered Patricia Barnes was still no more than speculation . The body buried in Moorpark might not even be the prostitute . She made the necessary call to Investigations and started someone rolling . Then she called Clinton . He was huffing and puffing when he answered the phone . " Did Cunningham call you ? " she asked . " No , I just walked in the office this second . What 's up ? " " They found a body in Moorpark and it may be Patricia Barnes . He 's on the way now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fuck ... " he said , letting the word roll off his tongue and linger . " You had the guy nailed from the beginning . " " Do n't get ahead of yourself , Clinton . It might not be her . That 's a virtual dumping ground for homicide victims out there from all over the state . " She paused , trying to read his thoughts , knowing how she would feel in his position . " If this is her , she was already dead when you dismissed , so there was nothing you could do . Hernandez is dead anyway . "  | " But we had him arid released him , and I wanted to plead him on a misdemeanor . " " All water under the bridge now , " she said , glancing at her watch . " It was only a wild guess on my part in the first place , or woman 's intuition , if there is such a thing . Listen , " she said , " fill Richard in on what 's going on when he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No telling what other crimes he could have committed if someone had n't killed him . " Clinton was thinking out loud , persecuting himself . Concluding with assurances that she would fill him in on whatever developed , she hung up and rushed from the office to pick up Shana . If he only knew , she thought .  | Ghana , " Lily yelled the moment she walked into the house . " Come on , we 're late . " John had a pile of raw hamburger in a big bowl and was mixing it with ketchup , raw egg , and onions . He was making his second favorite dish after roast chicken : meat loaf . When she came through the door , he wiped his red-smeared hands on a paper towel , and Lily thought instantly of blood and severed arms . Shana appeared in the kitchen , dressed neatly in a button-down blouse , a black skirt , and the low heels they had purchased for her to wear to the last dance at school . Her hair was pulled back with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own hair , and she looked more like fifteen than thirteen . Her eyes were solemn . " Go ahead and get in the car , sweetie , " she said . " You look so pretty . I just have to run to the bathroom . " " Is n't she gorgeous ? " John said , walking over and grabbing her around the waist and hugging her . Just as he started to kiss her , she pulled her face away and  | glared at him . " Stop it . I told you not to do that anymore . I 'm too old for that stuff . " John stepped back , his mouth open , obviously hurt . Exchanging only detached eye contact with him when he looked at her for an explanation of Shana 's behavior , Lily rushed to the master bathroom and closed the door behind her , removing a little bottle from the medicine cabinet . She dropped on her knees in front of the white porcelain commode , feeling nauseous , but nothing happened . Her child was living through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she felt the way she did , uncertain who to trust , isolating herself from other young people . Removing one of the little pink pills , Valium , and tossing it into her mouth , she leaned down to the sink and swallowed it with tap water . There was only one pill left . She would have to get it refilled tomorrow . The Ventura Police Department was housed in a brandnew building , on a street named after a sergeant who had been killed in the line of duty : Dowell Drive . Lily recalled when the department had been housed in a couple of trailers , attached to an old run-down building . Now it was all carpet , and each desk sported a computer terminal . The detective met them in the lobby . Lily had known the woman for years . Detective Margie Thomas was close to retirement  --  or beyond , for that matter , probably surpassing the twenty-year mark several years before and electing to stay on as long as she could pass the physical . There was no doubt that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . She was the first woman police officer in Ventura , the first to make detective , and the first to earn the respect of her male counterparts . Her hair was tinted a shade too dark to be flattering ; she was heavy in the lower section of her body , making it look like she had an old-fashioned bustle underneath her shirtwaist navy blue cotton dress . With thick , painted-on eyebrows and eyes almost a shade of lavender , she made Lily think of Elizabeth Taylor during her boozy , blubbery days . Margie took one of Shana 's hands , sat down on the lobby  | sofa with her , and just looked her over . " How you doing , doll ? " she asked . " Boy , are you a pretty thing . You 've got your mom to thank for that hair , that 's for sure . " Shana did n't smile and slipped her hand from the detec-tive 's . " I 'm doing fine , " she answered politely . " I 'd feel a lot better if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed this possibility with Shana , Lily wondered if she thought about this often , maybe at night in her room before she went to sleep , or in the early hours when she got up long before anyone else . If she could only assure her that he would never hurt anyone again . " Okay , this is what we 're going to do today , " Margie said , her voice light and breezy , as if they were going to have fun or something . " I 've prepared some pictures of men who resemble the man you and your mother described and have backgrounds that make them possible suspects . I 'm going to let you sit at my desk , Shana , and look at half the pictures . Your mom will sit in the other room and look at the other half , and then you 'll exchange . If you see someone that resembles the man who attacked you , you write down the number by his name . You may see several faces and not be certain , but that 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She paused and looked at Shana only , aware that Lily was all too familiar with the routine . " If you do see someone , then we can try to get this man in for a real lineup so that you can be absolutely certain . " She stopped and stood , adding , " Any questions and I will be right across the room . Okay ? " Lily started thumbing through the photos , seeing a number of men she 'd prosecuted through the years , sometimes amazed that they were back on the street and trying to recall the exact particulars of each case . One face she remembered from years back , noting how he 'd aged and recalling the ten or twelve counts of indecent exposure she 'd prosecuted and pleabargained down to two counts and ninety days in jail . They called these men " weanie wavers , " and statistics proved they  | seldom committed more serious offenses . Should n't even be in the lineup , Lily thought . After about ten minutes , she was eager to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office she was occupying and call Oxnard P.D . to see if she could contact Cunningham . It was too early , anyway , she decided and continued to look at the faces , no longer actually seeing them , letting her thoughts roam . Looking at the photos the way they were presented made her think of the proofs professional photographers give their clients to make their selections , and she realized that it had been over a year since Shana 's last portrait . She would have to have one done in another month or so . She glanced through the glass and saw her daughter intently staring at each face on each page at Margie 's desk . Thinking this whole process was a catharsis in many ways for Shana , she was glad that John had called the police . Considering the way things were shaping up , and with the simple fact that what she had done was done and there was no going back , Lily thought that someday she might be able to detach herself from that terrible morning in Oxnard . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testifying against him , merely fulfilling that first mission that Lily had suspected all along  --  to kill her  --  then he might have followed the same pattern with her and her daughter . Perhaps God had intervened and it was His hand that guided her that night . It was His voice Lily had heard in her mind and not the ghost of her dead father . Recalling the religious fervor of her early childhood , she vowed she would take Shana to the Catholic church one Sunday . Deep in thought , she jumped when the door to the small office opened and Margie appeared with Shana . The policewoman was holding something in her hands and she took a seat next to Lily . Shana was ashen and wide-eyed , her hands by her side , an excited expression on her face . Margie opened  | her mouth to speak , but Shana blurted out : " I found him . I know it 's him . I 'm certain . Show her , " she urged , reaching over and pushing Margie 's shoulder . " Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lily felt perspiration oozing from every pore in her body and knew that she would be drenched in seconds . Waiting for the heavy pressure in her chest signaling a heart attack , she felt blood rush from her face . Margie saw her distress . " My God , you look ill , " she said and turned to Shana with a degree of urgency . " Go and get your mother some cold water from the water cooler  --  right at the back of the room you were in . And bring some paper towels from the bathroom and soak them in cold water . Hurry , now . " Shana ran from the room . " Do you want me to call an ambulance ? " she said to Lily , seeing the moisture darkening the pale green blouse she was wearing , watching as beads of sweat dropped from her forehead , over her nose , and down her chin . " Are you having chest pains ? " Lily tried to monitor her breathing and calm herself . She felt like there was a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was just having a panic attack , long overdue . Shana had seen a photo of someone who resembled Hernandez , and she would realize it was the wrong man as soon as she saw him in person . " I 'm okay . Just too much pressure , I guess . I 've even had a case of shingles , so ... " " I had those too one time , " Margie said sympathetically . " Boy , do they hurt . Nerves . That 's what they said caused it . " Shana returned , her mouth tight with concern , carrying the wet towels and a cup of ice water . She handed them to her mother and stood back , watching while Lily wiped her face and the back of her neck , and then left the soggy , cold paper towels resting on her neck while she sipped water from the Styrofoam cup . " I 'm fine , " she said , reassuring Shana . " Might even be coming down with the flu or something . " She placed 194  | her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just give me a minute and I 'll look at the photo . " " Relax , " Margie said . " You can even go home and come back in the morning . One more day ? " " No , " Shana said , her voice louder than normal , insistent , " let her see it now . Then you can put him in jail . " The detective turned and took Shana 's hand . " Just give your mom a minute , honey . This has been real hard on her too . Even if your mom agrees that this man resembles the man who attacked you , we ca n't just go out and arrest him . You 'll have to see him in a real lineup , and we 'll have to get an order from a judge to arrest him . That 's the way it works . " Shana stared impatiently at Lily , impervious to whatever was wrong with her , wanting her to confirm her selection . Lily could see her chest rise and fall visibly with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see the photo . " Asking Shana to return to the desk she had been at previously , the detective handed Lily a stack of pages with photos just like the ones she had been looking at before they had entered . " Go through each one slowly and do n't respond just because she has told you she saw someone . I told her to remain outside , but she followed me in here . If you do select someone , it should be completely independent . " Seeing that Lily appeared in control , she said , " I 'm going to step outside . Come out when you 're through . " As she searched each page , she now was really looking , wanting to see the man Shana had seen , certain that he resembled Hernandez but knowing that half of Oxnard resembled Hernandez . She occasionally glanced out the window of the office , looking for Shana . She was out of visual range . Margie had more than likely taken her to the vending machines for a soda or to the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw him . My God , a dead ringer , she thought , leaving no question  | as to why Shana had become so excited . Even if he was not the right man , simply seeing his face propelled her back to the fear and humiliation , the degradation of that night . Her pain for what her daughter had suffered was agonizing . The man had an almost identical shape to his face , his eyes , his nose , his mouth . Even the way his hair was cut was similar to Her-nandez 's . He looked younger , however , and Lily knew he was not the rapist . He could n't be . The rapist was dead . She took her time and studied his face closely . She recalled how photographs were sometimes miles apart from the actual person . They were one-dimensional , and this man in the flesh , in profile , in body conformation , could look entirely different , she rationalized . Removing the paper towels from her neck , she felt the crisis had passed . Just go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he looks somewhat like the attacker , because it would be absurd to say anything different . So what if the guy had to be yanked in for a lineup ? He 'd done something at one time or another to place himself in this position . She certainly was n't going to worry about some unknown man with a criminal history at this point . Once they saw him , the whole thing would be dropped . Lily would state that he was n't the man and that would be it . She picked up the package of photos and calmly left the office . Margie and Shana were walking through the doors to the detective bureau , where six desks were lined up , three to a side . It was six-thirty and only one detective was still working , files open , phone in his ear , his feet on the desk . Shana held a Coke in her hand and appeared subdued but anxious . Lily had her finger on the page containing the photo of the man she was certain Shana had picked . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I admit , I have one that 's real close , but I 'm pretty sure it 's not the man , " Lily said without enthusiasm . Seeing the taut look of frustration in Shana 's eyes , she quickly added , " But it 's real close and worthy of additional investigation . " Setting the photos down on Margie 's desk , she turned to  | the correct page and placed a finger on his face . " Number thirty-six is the one I picked . " Her look was questioning , but she did n't have to wait long for a response . " That 's him , " Shana said , turning to the detective eagerly . " Told you . That 's him . Number thirty-six . " " Shana , I do n't feel as positive as you . I want you to know that from the start , and remember , I got a better look at him when he was leaving . You were terribly distraught . " The visual image of him standing in the light from the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profile  --  she even recalled the top of his head as he bent down to snap his pants . She glanced back down at the photo , but also noticed the other men on the page . Out of six , two were wearing a red T-shirt or sweatshirt . Red was a gang color . She knew that  --  every other Hispanic in Oxnard wore red and those silly baseball caps . She then started thumbing back through the pages and saw more red shirts . One man was wearing a gold chain with a crucifix . She turned the page and saw another one , only smaller . If she let her imagination go now , she might end up in a mental institution . The man she had shot was the man . It must end there and end now . " Mom , you did n't even have your glasses on that night , and you do n't have them on now , " Shana snapped . " He raped me , remember , and I can see perfectly . " She turned to Margie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she drives too , but she never does . " " I only really need them to read  --  just a little farsighted , " Lily informed the detective . " Anyway , arguing over it right now is counterproductive . Can you pull him in for a lineup ? " " I 'll get right on it and call you as soon as it can be arranged . Why do n't you two go home now and get some rest and try to put this out of your mind ? " As Shana walked past her mother , heading for the door , Margie gave Lily a look with those Liz Taylor eyes and shrugged her shoulders . " Life 's a bitch , is n't it ? " she said .  | " You got that right , " Lily replied and started walking out , trying to catch Shana . Margie 's voice projected and echoed in the large room . " Oh , I 'm sure I do n't have to mention this , but it might not be a bad idea for you to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the real thing . " She returned to her desk , sat down , shifting from side to side until her flesh-and-blood bustle was comfortable , and then turned her back on Lily . By the time Lily made it out of the building , Shana was waiting by the passenger door of the Honda . As she started the car , Lily told her , " They 'll get the lineup together and we 'll go from there , okay ? " The girl was staring straight ahead . They rode in silence for quite some time . " Why do n't you turn on the radio ? " Lily suggested . " He 's still out there . I know it now . I thought he 'd run away . He did n't . He 's still out there . You told me he 'd go far away and never come back so he would n't get caught . " Lily hesitated , torn now , not knowing exactly what to say and thinking she must call the psychologist and get Shana in to see her tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do , even if she became angry . " I really feel he 's long gone , honey , and like I said back there , I do n't think it 's him . I can see things far away better than I can close up : that 's what farsightedness means . When he was close , it was very dark , but when he was leaving , he was farther away and in the light . " She reached for her hand , holding it tightly . " I do n't think the man you saw was him . He 's gone . You 're a smart girl . You know a lot of people look alike . Even you and I look alike , but of course , I 'm a lot older . If we were the same age , people could mistake us even . See ? " Shana reached out and turned on the radio , a rock station . She then said over the noise , " It was him , Mom . When you see him with your glasses , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cunningham pushed the speedometer up to eighty on the two-year-old Chrysler sedan and felt the chassis shake beneath him , but the large engine had the capacity to break a hundred with no problem . He sometimes missed the days behind the wheel of a screaming black-andwhite , the radio turned full tilt to hear the dispatcher over the siren , the streets coming up in seconds , knowing each time he raced through an intersection he could collide in a mammoth marriage of metal , his life over , or arrive at the scene of whatever hot call he was rolling to and meet some nut with a shotgun ready to blow him to kingdom come . Those were the brawn and balls days , far behind him . These were the days when he went home with a headache instead of a black eye or a bruised kidney . These days he had to use what was between his ears . It was hard for him to imagine any other job , no matter how much he tried and how much he complained . He quite simply loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at the same time , he always had something to occupy his mind . Trying to put together the missing pieces in a homicide  | was to Cunningham like completing the New York Times crossword puzzle in ink : always having the little puzzle in his back pocket to play with , yet aware that he had to find just the right word and make sure it fit perfectly before he filled in the blank spaces with his pen . He was not a man who made mistakes . Mistakes lead to guilty men walking free on the streets , thumbing their noses at law officers who were hasty and sloppy . Thinking of the case at hand , and the issue of jurisdiction if the body was in fact Patricia Barnes , he was certain the sheriff 's department would be more than pleased to kick the case to his side of the fence . The victim had been seen last in Oxnard , reported missing in that city , and the primary suspect was now the victim of an Oxnard homicide investigation . There were far too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing this information already , even though a positive identification had n't been made , the sheriff 's department was probably handling it like anything else that was on the burner : to be handed off like a hot potato . And that meant mistakes . He took his foot off the gas once he left the main road . It did n't take him long to determine that he was in the right place . Three county black-and-whites were parked along an unpaved but graded dirt road where a new housing tract was going in : a white van belonging to the medical examiner , an unmarked police unit , and a black-and-white crime-scene unit . Other than two bulldozers and a few other pieces of construction equipment , no other civilians appeared to be present and , thank God , he thought , no reporters or television remote vans as yet . The professionals themselves frequently trampled and destroyed valuable evidence . Reporters and onlookers were a homicide investigator 's worst nightmare . He flung the door to his unit open and removed his shield from his back pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches from the buckle . " Shit , " he said , stepping out into the soft dirt and sinking . The day before , he had finally taken a few minutes to have his worn-out black shoes polished and  | shined while he had a haircut . Now they were filthy again and would look even worse than they had before . Waste of money , he thought as he started marching in the direction of the uniforms , knowing it was n't really messing up his shoes that annoyed him . What he never got used to was finding the rotting remains of people , thrown away like useless garbage . Charlie Daniels , the medical examiner , was leaning over the edge of the shallow grave , holding up a dirt-covered arm with a plastic gloved hand . He dropped it when he saw Cunningham . " Your case , my man ? " he asked . " Go on . Take a look . Couple more pictures and we 're gon na take her out . " " Who 's crime scene here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a white sheriff 's office shirt and black pants stepped forward . The two men backed away from the others and , looking at the ground as they spoke , the crime-scene officer filled Cunningham in on what had transpired prior to his arrival . " My partner is reloading the camera in the unit , " he said . " As soon as we got here , we made a pretty extensive search of the area before we allowed anyone else to disturb it . Even the construction worker was pretty cool . Once he saw what he thought was the body , he went and called and did n't go back . We picked up a lot of junk , and it 's bagged and in the van . " The name on the man 's shirt read TOM STAFFORD . " Okay , Stafford , " Cunningham said . A bulldozer had run right over the whole thing , eliminating such vital evidence as tire marks or indications of how far and from where the body had been dragged to its grave . They would expand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed , and although they might have picked up various items , there was no way to know if they were related to the homicide until forensics got to them . " I guess you would have told me if you found a weapon or something , right ? " " No such luck . Not unless you think she was killed with a couple of beer cans , a candy wrapper , or the carcass of what looks like a cat . "  | Stepping to the edge of the grave now that he was satisfied that the crime scene had been secured and as much evidence collected as possible , Cunningham looked down at the corpse . He had little doubt it was Patricia Barnes . It sure was n't Ethel Owen . Ethel was a tiny woman , and this woman was far from small . " We dusted her off enough for you to see her face , " the medical examiner offered . " She 's a big one , huh ? " Almost every orifice of her body was filled with dirt , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last scream of terror before death . Her eyes were also open , but small animals had feasted on a good portion of them and little was left . As Cunningham reached into his pocket and pulled out three photos of the woman given him by her sister , Daniels leaned over again and scraped more dirt off her open mouth . Scooping it out with a gloved finger , he exposed a dried-up , purplish tongue extending onto her bottom lip . Around her neck were distinct discolorations , but there appeared to be no other wounds . " Strangulation ? " Cunningham asked , expressing his opinion on the cause of death . The protruding tongue and marks on her throat were classic . " Well now , we have n't turned her over . Just might have a knife sticking out of her back , but from this viewpoint I would agree . " With that the medical examiner stood and stretched his back  --  he then took a white handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped the sweat off his forehead . " You give the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before Cunningham answered , the M.E. 's assistant and one of the crime-scene men started toward the body . " Go , " he said . It was his girl . The black short skirt and bright pink sweater she had been reported wearing when missing locked it up . He watched as they removed her : three good-sized men , still straining under the dead weight . Although she was fat and out of shape , in the pictures he had seen a pretty face and a pleasant  | smile . Some men liked big women , he speculated , wondering just how much she got for turning a trick but certain it was n't much . She sure was n't pretty now . They placed her on a plastic sheet and rolled her onto her stomach , the M.E. brushing off dirt with his hand and then lifting her sweater and checking her back . " Nada , my man . No reason to remove her skirt here . Nothing there that I can see . We 'll cut it off later and bag it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The M.E. stuck his hand up the back of her skirt , like a ventriloquist , and after feeling around , he withdrew it . " No signs of sexual assault right now , as the crotch is still in place  --  unless he raped her somewhere else and then had her dress , come here , and then strangled her , " he said , standing . " Believe me , no one but this lady herself could get that panty hose over that ass in one piece . They feel like they 're steel-belted anyway . " He laughed and the laughter spread through the crowd of men . They welcomed it . Even in the open air , the smell of decomposing flesh was overpowering , and many turned away . The M.E. was waving his hands over his head , swatting at a fly . Cunningham looked down at the large lump of flesh that had once been a living , breathing human being : a mother , a daughter , a sister to others who cared . The only thought that came to mind was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , never have to suck some guy 's dick to feed her two kids , and would never have to worry about retirement . Her troubles were over . Maybe this sad life had earned her another as a rich , skinny Beverly Hills beauty . Sure , he thought , like reincarnation . As far as he was concerned , that was the one good thing about death : no one really knew who the winners and losers were on the other side . It was a hell of a lot better not knowing . While more photographs were taken of both the body and the empty grave , and Officer Stafford started looking for evidence in the grave itself , the investigator from the district at-torney 's office arrived , eyes squinting from the sunlight without  | shades , complaining that he 'd taken a wrong turn and ended up in the middle of nowhere . Cunningham filled him in , but related that he would call Lily Forrester himself as soon as he could spring free . The press arrived , complete with a film crew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . The place was rapidly becoming a zoo . Cunningham removed his shield and placed it in his pocket , finding the first uniform that responded . " Once the body is removed , you clear and write up your report and fax it to my office , with my name on it . " " It 's not much , " the young officer stated , " just the statement from the construction worker and who I notified , you know . My sergeant said he spoke with you , and it 's your case if you claim it . With the riots and all , a lot of our men have been working in L.A. , and we 're hardly able to handle what we have already . " Before he could make a formal statement along these lines , he would have to get her sister to meet him at the morgue for a positive ID and clear it with the captain . " As far as the press are concerned  --  and anyone else , for that matter  --  she 's an unidentified homicide victim as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer . " You better write it like it 's yours right now and tell your sergeant I said so . I 'll call him later this evening . " He tapped Daniels on the shoulder as he walked to his unit , while they loaded the body . " I 'll get the victim 's sister in tonight , if I can find her . You gon na be around , Charlie ? " " Not tonight , my man . Day 's over for me . Call or come by around three tomorrow afternoon , " he yelled over the roar of a passing plane . Two hours later , Cunningham exited the morgue with Anita Ramirez , the identification made . The woman was crying and blubbering , rattling on about the kids , telling Cunningham that she had three of her own and did n't know how she could raise another two . Thank God she had arrived with several other  | family members and collapsed in their arms , freeing him to leave . He went to a pay phone and called his captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started to hang up and call Forresterwhen the captain stopped him . " Bruce , I have some bad news about the Owen homicide . " He froze . The case was down . The defendant sentenced to prison . He waited , holding his breath , thinking Ethel Owen had suddenly walked into the police station after an extended vacation in Europe and made them all look like a bunch of idiots . " They called while you were out today . Franco Andrade was released on bail today pending appeal of the conviction . " " What the fuck . . . ? " " Look , Bruce , the evidence was completely circumstantial . It was a minor miracle the jury even delivered a guilty verdict to begin with . You knew he appealed . Well , the judge felt the case was weak enough to merit his release on bail . What can I tell you , guy ? Win some , lose some . " He hung up and kicked the brick wall by the phone , almost breaking his toe and putting a jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released on the street . All that work for nothing . The appeal could take years , and that slimy bastard would just find another old woman to prey on or fucking kill . He was livid . All they were doing was chasing their own tails around and around in little circles like a bunch of mongrel dogs . " Win some , lose some , " he said between clenched teeth , repeating his captain 's words as he picked up the phone to call Lily Forrester . " Fucking lose some and then some is what I 'd call it . Fucking disgrace is what . Judge 's own mother should meet up with Franco and see how he likes it . " Before he tossed in the coin , he looked up at the sky . The sun was setting and it was getting dark . The air was still thick with ashes from the fires in L.A. , and his white shirt was sprinkled with it . " We tried , Ethel , " he said . " That 's about all we can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers with a baffled look on his face . " Shana said you got sick at the police station . Said they almost had to call an ambulance . Now you 're talking like a nut case . What in the hell are you trying to say ? " Lily 's body was still facing the wall , her head turned to John . " I meant to say I wish I could kill him . " " Yeah , well , I wish I could kill him too . But why did you tell Shana that he was n't the right man ? " " Because he is n't the right man . Leave me alone , John . " Lily was still staring , her voice a low monotone . John started to walk toward the bedroom chair , his eyes still on Lily , a look of concern on his face . " Do n't sit down , John . I said to leave me alone and I meant it . Her eyes stopped him ; the words were hardly needed . He stood in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to move . " You know what 's wrong with this world , John ? People do n't listen . That 's what 's wrong . People just do n't listen . " He turned and left . Lily walked to the bathroom , looked in the mirror , and poured out the last Valium . Then she found the sleeping pills the doctor had prescribed for Shana and removed one of those as well . She put her face under the tap and let the water run into her open mouth . She stared at her face until the awareness that it was her own reflection began to fade and she searched the image . She could see her eyelashes fluttering , her nostrils slowly opening and closing , tiny beads of tap water on her open mouth . She wanted to move her flesh-and-blood body behind that image , allow the cold glass of the mirror to separate her from the outside world , where she could still see and be seen but where there was protection . That night she did n't even bother to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face she 'd seen that day , the man so uncannily like Hernandez that he could be his brother . Then she recalled the men in the photo lineup , every one wearing a red shirt and a crucifix around their neck . " No , " she  | kept saying , trying to force her racing thoughts to stop , waiting for the pills to hit her bloodstream . It was nothing more than a coincidence , a fluke . It had to be . Finally she entered a drugged , dreamless void in the green blouse now stained from her perspiration , still wearing her skirt and panty hose , her bra tight around her chest .  | ily showered and dressed for work , grabbing the first thing she saw in her closet , feeling listless from the drugs . She then saw her reflection in the bedroom mirror and realized that she had worn the same suit only two days before . She stripped and suddenly found herself holding both the top and bottom of her favorite black-and-white outfit with the buttons up the side . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of her laundry had also been washed and folded and was stacked neatly in plastic bins in the closet . Buttoning up the side buttons of the skirt and adjusting the top , she felt the loose fabric and stepped on the bathroom scales . She 'd lost eight pounds since she had last weighed herself . With her hair pulled back , her cheeks looked sunken and her face drawn . She removed the clip from her hair and brushed it out , deciding to get it cut the following day . Something neat and soft around her face maybe  --  something more stylish . What she really wanted was to look in the mirror and see someone else . When she got to the kitchen , Shana was dressed and eating  | a bowl of cereal at the breakfast table . Di was eating her breakfast too , right at Shana 's feet . She jumped up and poured her mother a cup of coffee , handing it to her . " You did all my laundry , did n't you ? " Lily asked quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . " Shana was placing her cereal bowl in the dishwasher and picked up the sponge and washed off the sink . " It was nothing , Mom . " She turned and faced Lily . " You work hard and you 've been so tired lately . I 'm worried about you . " " Come here , " Lily said , holding her arms out . Shana walked into them and hugged her around the waist . " What about you , baby ? Are you okay ? " Shana pulled away , mustering up a smile . " I 'm fine . You know " ? she looked at Lily as if she would know exactly what she meant ? " some days are okay and some are terrible . Like if you let it get to you and think about it all the time . But I 'm trying not to do that . " She took her little puppy to her room , covered the floor with papers , and shut the door . Lily drove her to school and watched her walk into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet away , her shoulders slumped and Lily had to look away . She 'd never really understood her own daughter 's magical personality . Shana had n't just been born with it ; she had worked to acquire and maintain it , just like a great athlete or concert pianist . But the rape had taken away the laughter and the optimism , and Lily wondered if she would ever be the same . Richard was in the hall leading to her office , waiting when she arrived , a tentative smile on his face , a steaming cup of hot coffee in his hand , and reeking in familiar lime . " And a good morning to you , " he said , his mouth dropping somewhat at her solemn expression . " You look good . Great dress , but do I sense a rotten mood this morning ? " Lily had a pink slip in her hand , handed to her by one of the secretaries on the way in , stating that Detective Margie Thomas had called . Richard followed her into her office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in her incoming  | bin , and an even deeper furrow developed in her brow . " Sorry , " she said , " guess it 's that time of the month or something . PMS . " Her smile barely lifted the corners of her mouth and then collapsed again . Richard moved his chair closer to her desk , reached across , and picked up the entire stack of files in the bin , placing them on the floor next to him . " Now , does that make you feel any better ? I got here at six-thirty and have already cleared my desk . Tell me how it went yesterday with Shana . " " First of all , Richard , I do n't want you to make it a habit of covering for me and absorbing the entire work load of this unit . " Lily 's voice was a lot harsher than she had intended . " Do n't you think that you 're defeating the purpose of me sharing the responsibilities if I ca n't cut you some slack when the going gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . And Butler knows that too . " Her emotionalism the other night with him had diminished her in his eyes . She could see it clearly . Insisting that he put the cases back would be useless . " Thanks , Rich . The body they found in Moorpark was Patricia Barnes . Cunningham called me last night after her sister identified her . " " And . . . " he said . " She was strangled and not much evidence links it to Hernandez , but they 're working on it . Cunningham wants us to make some calls and see if we can get a surveillance team on his brother , Manny , hoping we can get something , anything , to determine if they were involved in the McDonald  --  Lopez slayings . " " What happened with the lineup ? " he asked again , concern in his eyes . " There 's a suspect . She 's positive ; I feel exactly the opposite . He looks like the guy but is n't . " Lily saw her glasses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping them on . " Because I do n't wear my damn glasses , Shana thinks I could n't really see him , but I 'm only a little farsighted , and I guarantee you that I saw the bastard . "  | " But maybe she 's right and you 're wrong . Ever think of that ? What 's his status ? Are they picking him up ? " Richard spoke between clenched teeth , sitting up straight in the chair . Lily bristled . " Do n't get involved in this , Richard . " She again regretted her harshness and hurried to close the door to her office , not wanting anyone to hear . She returned to her desk and bent over , speaking in a whisper . " I 'm sorry I reacted like that . . I know you care about me and it 's natural for you to want to know what 's going on , but if I let this -- this ... you know , you and I talking about it in the office every day . . . well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , " he said , touching her hand quickly and then removing it . " I understand . Tell me what you want me to know . I wo n't mention it again . And let 's have dinner tonight . " Lily sighed deeply , started to say no , and then recalled that Shana had softball practice tonight and she would be alone in the empty house . If she could get her in to see the psychologist after practice and John could take her . . . ? " I 'll let you know a little later . It 's possible , " she said . " I 'm sorry about the other night . " Instead of looking at him , she focused on the glass partition , watched as one of the secretaries passed with an armful of papers . " The other night was my fault , Lily . I 'm the one who was insensitive . After you left , I felt like a jackass . " She tried to bring forth memories of their first night together and the next day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It seemed like another lifetime . " I 'll call you later , " she said softly . As he bent down and picked up the stack of cases , she pushed Butler 's extension on the phone and started her pitch for a surveillance team on Manny Hernandez . Richard reached over and touched the back of her neck before leaving , causing a shiver to race up and down her spine . After getting Butler to agree to call Oxnard P.D . and put the necessary pressure on , she tried to reach Margie Thomas . They informed her that the detective was in the field . The  | psychologist , however , was in and agreed to see Shana at eight o'clock . Shana and her father could pick up a bite to eat after the softball practice , leaving her free to have dinner with Richard . " And are you going to come in ? " the psychologist asked Lily . " I came in with Shana last week , " she said . " I mean for a session . I really feel you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . " Lily knew she could never sit down and spill her guts to this woman . There was far too much she could never discuss with anyone . Thinking of the woman 's loafers and white socks , she felt like she would be telling her life story , with all its dark secrets , to one of Shana 's school friends . " I 'm really more concerned here with my daughter , and I do n't have the time . " The psychologist cleared her throat , sort of a humph , as if she heard this line every day . Lily continued : " I want you to talk to her about why she has suddenly decided that she wants to transfer out of the school system and move in with me . It would solve a lot of problems for me . " Lily realized that sounded self-centered and corrected herself . " What I mean is that my husband and I are planning to divorce , and you 're aware that I moved back in because of the rape . So , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't want to encourage her to do something that will be harmful to her . " " It 's a two-sided coin , " the woman said . " Remaining in a home with two people who are obviously living together for her benefit , and specifically because of the assault , coupled with the tension that has to be present among all three of you , is not healthy . On the other hand , a radical change of environment such as changing schools and leaving all her friends behind is not advisable right now . " " Well , " Lily said , expecting this type of comment  --  did n't all shrinks talk out of both sides of their mouth ? ? " could you at least find out why she wants to change schools ? And try to explore if she really wants to live with me. "  | " Certainly , " the woman said . She then replied firmly , " Mrs. Forrester , I realize you 're a district attorney and used to having any information you desire , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate you informing me of any problem areas , but I ca n't repeat what your daughter says . " Lily felt the muscles in her face twitch and knew her composure was dissolving . " This is my daughter we 're talking about and this is a serious matter . Either you 're going to help me or we 'll seek another therapist . " Just then her secretary , Jan , walked in and Lily flicked her hand with annoyance , causing the poor girl to retreat hastily . Lily turned her chair toward the wall . " There 's no reason for you to become excited , " Dr. Lindstrom said in her placating tone . " I did n't say I would n't discuss it with her . I will . I just ca n't funnel information to you . " She paused . " All you have to do is discuss it with her . She seems very close to you right now . In fact , she 's exceedingly concerned about you . The greatest gift you could give her is to seek therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel she 's going to handle this all very well in time . " " Another reason I called is that Shana picked a man from the photo lineup that she believes is the rapist . I do n't . I think when she sees him in the flesh , she 'll know he is n't the right man , but I think you should discuss this possibility with her . " " Certainly , " she replied and then added , " Before you go , I 'd like to give you a phone number for that group I told you about  --  the incest survivors ' group . Here it is . " Lily was doodling circles inside triangles , her head close to her desk , and without thinking , she copied down the phone number and printed the word incest beside it in script so small it was almost illegible . " Maybe I 'll see you there . We meet every Thursday evening . " With a voice as small as the letters , Lily responded , " So , you run the group ? "
