<p> TO express joy on a festive Jewish holiday , it is traditional to wear something new . Last week , for a Passover seder at her parents ' home in Borough Park , Brooklyn , Suzy Berkowitz , 50 , upheld tradition from head to toe . Exemplifying the Diana Vreeland dictum that elegance is restraint , she wore new Gucci pumps and a new Armani suit , hemmed discreetly just below the knee . She also wore a custom-made wig bought for the occasion . <p> Like many other Orthodox women who follow Halakha , Jewish law , Mrs. Berkowitz has worn a wig since her wedding day . Women 's hair exudes sensual energy , the Talmud teaches , and covering it insures a married woman 's modesty . But the Talmud also obliges a wife to care for her appearance , so though a hat or scarf will do , many Orthodox women favor wigs , the more natural looking the better . <p> In fact , it was impossible to tell that Mrs. Berkowitz 's rich , auburn hair  --  bobbed chin length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wig . Stylish Orthodox women like Mrs. Berkowitz eschew synthetic ready-made wigs for custom ones of human hair that closely approximate their own tresses . And much attention is paid , from purchase to the cut and style ( new high-end wigs come straight and uncut ) . <p> " We talk about wigs the way women who do n't wear them talk about their hair , " said Liba Noe , 45 , of Borough Park , who with her husband owns Eshel Jewelry Manufacturing in Manhattan and who owns a Claire , called by its aficionados the Rolls-Royce of Orthodox wigs . " When women get together at a wedding or a party they ask , ' Where did you get your shoes , dress and wig ? ' They even ask , ' Who did it ? ' " <p> For Passover , Suzy Berkowitz chose a $2,000 Olga , made by Olga Berman , a Hungarian wig maker in Bensonhurst ( Mrs. Berkowitz also owns a Claire and an equally high status Ralph ) . For that critical cut and style , she turned to Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients who pay at least $600 to have their wigs transformed . <p> " Orthodox women want something contemporary and realistic , and do n't want a wig to look like what it is , " said Mr. Garrison as he began the slow , tedious process  --  three to four hours  --  required to shampoo , cut and style a wig . " It 's a challenge . You ca n't rely on next time . There is no next time . " <p> Most swank stylists , including Frederic Fekkai , John Barrett , Oribe , John Sahag and Oscar Blandi , do wigs for Orthodox women . They aim to make them modest but not matronly and definitely not wiggy , the word Orthodox women use to describe the heavy appearance of wigs . <p> Taking the idea of verisimilitude further , Mr. Fekkai suggested : " An Orthodox woman should have several wigs . A real haircut grows out at different lengths . You need more than one wig at different lengths . " <p> Given the code of modesty that Orthodox women abide by , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone , is it a contradiction to wear a wig , especially a stylish one ? <p> " When the practice of wearing a wig first emerged , there was quite a protest , " said Rabbi Rafael Grossman , the president of the Rabbinical Council of America , the world 's largest body of Orthodox rabbis . " There are those authorities who strongly object . A wig would seem to contradict the basic principal of avoiding incitement . But my personal view is that it is acceptable because the rudiments of Halakha only require women not to expose their hair , though a woman should avoid wearing a wig that could appear to be sensual . " <p> Rabbi Avi Weiss , of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale in the Bronx , agreed . " I would distinguish between being stylish and being immodest , " he said . " Jewish law is not monolithic . There can be two views , and they can be both opposite and correct . " <p> Wearing a wig is a fairly modern Jewish practice . Before the 19th century , proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In feudal times , some women actually shaved their heads to detract from their appearance and thwart rapacious landlords who had the right to claim a bride 's virginity before the groom did . Today , some women who are Hasidic , an Orthodox sect , still shave their heads as an added measure of propriety . But by and large , women either pin their hair up or cut it short and wear a wig . <p> Many young Orthodox brides insist on wigs that match their hair in style , texture and color , which also helps ease the jitters when a newlywed first dons a wig . " I want my wig to look exactly like my hair , " said Elky Stern , 22 and a student at Touro College in Brooklyn , whose long blond hair will be covered when she gets married in June . " At college , everyone who is engaged discusses wigs . Even the guys talk about it because they know the girls are nervous . " <p> Before she was married two years ago , Rifka Locker , 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrison style her straight , red hair . He cut it above her shoulders , angled it around her face , and layered the top in a style that became the prototype for her straight , red wig . ( Orthodox rabbis frown on male stylists working on a woman 's real hair once she is married ) . Putting on the wig the morning after her wedding , Mrs. Locker remembered : " I was confident wearing it . No one could even tell I got married . " <p> Mrs. Locker bought her two wigs  --  custom-made for special occasions , ready-made for everyday  --  at Claire 's Accuhair in Midwood , Brooklyn . <p> Claire Grunewald , who is Zsa Zsa Gabor-like with her false eyelashes , rhinestone-rimmed glasses and strawberry blond bob with honey highlights , is an expert sheitel macher , or wig maker . A Holocaust survivor from Hungary , she spent three years after the war in a displaced people 's camp , where she was an apprentice to a German wig maker . Mrs. Grunewald immigrated to the United States in 1949 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 years to Orthodox women . <p> " I had the most beautiful strawberry blond hair and did n't want it covered when I got married , but my religion dictated it , " she said . " To make matters worse , no one could style my sheitel the way I liked it . At 19 , it made me look 35 . So I started making my own wigs . Then I had a dream to manufacture a beautiful wig for the Jewish community . I had a dream that when you walked down a street , you would n't be able to say , This young woman is wearing a wig . " <p> The women who make up most of Claire 's affluent clientele travel from as far away as California and Israel for the wigs made on the premises of her family-run shop , complete with private fitting rooms . Of the 15 female workers , many sit at banquet tables , ventilating , or tying , strands of hair into wig foundations . The three male workers , who are not permitted in the salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily imported from Eastern Europe , where a woman 's braid sells for enough to feed a family for a month , Mrs. Grunewald said . <p> Six to eight braids per wig are woven into a lightweight , durable silk or lace-fitted cap . If styled , the process can take 40 to 60 hours . The cost is $1,700 for a Contessa , the ready-made style , and up to $4,000 for a custom design , depending on length and quality of hair . The expense , by tradition , falls on the bridegroom 's parents . <p> " A Claire wig is a designer thing , " said Chaya Nachsoni , the executive secretary of the company and one of Mrs. Grunewald 's three daughters working at the shop . " People say to me , ' Oh , a Claire , ' the wig everyone wants but no one can afford . It 's the Rolls-Royce of wigs . " <p> The status attached to a Claire wig is matched only by a Ralph , as in Raffaele Mollica , who works out of an atelier at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor is strewn with strands of hair and the walls lined with every variety of wig imaginable . There are long , dark Cher tresses , short , gray Geraldine Ferrara coifs , curly red Chelsea Clinton locks . Mr. Mollica , a native of Sicily , says he has had hundreds of Orthodox customers over the years , paying $2,700 to $3,500 for a wig that may take up to a year to make . Ralph devotees say it is well worth the wait . <p> Mr. Mollica got his start making wigs for Vidal Sassoon , who led the hair revolution of the 1960 's , from set-and-tease to loose , flowing styles . Mr. Mollica has adapted his mentor 's vision to wigs . <p> " He makes a wig cap which is white like my scalp , " said Elisa Mermelstein , 29 , a customer from Kew Gardens , Queens . " Also , the hair is thin , which prevents the wig from looking bulky . A white scalp and flat hair . Those are Ralph 's trademarks . They make for a natural-looking wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is there ever an opportunity for women to let down their real hair ? <p> " Whatever the Torah prohibits the Torah permits , " said Rabbi Mayer Fund , founder of the Flatbush Minyona , a synagogue in a largely Orthodox section of Brooklyn . <p> Since swimming is segregated by sex in Orthodox communities , women swim bareheaded , allowing their hair , which darkens from lack of sunlight , to have a fleeting chance to highlight naturally . And when Orthodox women are at home , where many wig-wearers don only a scarf lest an unexpected visitor appears , they will uncover their hair when ready for bed . <p> " You 're keeping your hair for your husband , " Mrs. Mermelstein explained . " He 's the one who gets to see it . "
