<p> A REAL TEST OF LEADERSHIP FOR CLINTON <p> Editor  --  While Paula Jones , Kenneth Starr , and many others are shaking the timbers , the president mounts the bully pulpit to improve race relations . It 's a brave move , and long overdue . <p> Last Monday 's Chron reports 58 percent of the people think the president is powerless to do anything about racism . Certainly that 's true if people believe a president , like a king , can make a proclamation and cause his soldiers to enforce it . <p> But as generals are powerless until they inspire their troops , so are democratic leaders . And the stage is set for a real test of leadership : racism is the most serious problem this country faces . And reactionary forces have slyly positioned attempts at redress , such as affirmative action , as forms of racism themselves . <p> This is probably Clinton 's best and last chance to pull off something positive to be remembered by . He 's been hobbled by the accusations of financial sleuths and the moralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoking condoms may actually be there . <p> He has to rise above these issues and pursue his racial initiatives single-mindedly . If he succeeds , he makes it into the history books . If not , he 's just another dusty bust in the Executive Office Building hallway . <p> FRED WICKHAM <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FOCUS ON REAL ISSUES <p> Editor  --  Flag etiquette requires that you fly the flag of the country you 're visiting as well as your national flag when you sail into a port . We spent six years sailing around the world , making two circumnavigations and visiting some 45 countries . Invariably , those countries with the least to offer were most punctilious about " proper " display of the flag . Generally speaking , they were either " comic opera countries , " in which officials in gaudy uniforms strutted pompously around town , or repressive regimes , in which officials in military uniforms marched around making sure everyone was following orders . In light of its passage of the flag-burning amendment , I assume the House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We have a great country , folks . We also have large problems  --  and flag burning is n't one of them . It 's time to tackle the real issues . <p> JOANNE SANDSTROM <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> A GOOFY BOYCOTT <p> Editor  --  The Southern Baptists are calling for another goofy boycott again , against the Walt Disney Corp . <p> This boycott effort would be more credible if it was aimed at a company that cashes in on , say , the gratuitous and dehumanizing portrayal of violence , instead of a company that built its reputation on family entertainment and continues to base its business on that . <p> I personally commend Disney for extending equal rights and fair treatment to gay people , but even if I felt otherwise , if I bought the right-wing idea that respecting gays somehow translates into being " anti-family , " I would realize that the other 98 percent of the Disney company is very beneficial to America 's chil dren and families . <p> It 's like boycotting the entire Bible because of a few passages you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CHARLES GODWIN <p> Davenport , Iowa <p> . <p> CUBA 'S EXAMPLE <p> Editor  --  Art Hoppe ( " Confessions of a Racist , " June 18 ) sees a black man at his door ( although I do n't think many knock ) . It makes him uncomfortable , and he concludes that the races will always be at odds in America . His attitude comes from growing up in a society which has always been racially stratified and which he says will never change no matter what our president says . <p> Art , what about Cuba ? You 've been there , you must have noticed the relative harmony in which Spanish and African descendants live there . You must also remember the time when Batista 's Cuba was a famous vicious racist state . <p> Castro and the Cuban leadership simply decreed that there shall be affirmative action : black Cubans shall be included in education and employment and housing . Although there are vestiges of racism there , Cuban society is now integrated . White and black and mixed folk live and work and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Clinton is no Fidel Castro . He would never be so revolutionary as to buck 200 years of history by doing something meaningful about our atrocious race relations . But he could if he wanted to . <p> BENJAMIN TREUHAFT <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> MONSTER CARS <p> Editor  --  Two frightening headlines in the Chronicle on June 16 , " Road Rage  --  ugly increase in acts of freeway fury , " and June 17 , " Detroit to Make Monster Cars  --  Ford 's 19-foot sport utility vehicle weighs 3 tons , can have V10 engine . " <p> These stories are closely interrelated as in " Which came first ? The chicken or the egg ? " ? Do normally sensible drivers change to the huge SUVs to protect themselves from drivers who drive SUVs to threaten those who drive cars of a sensible smaller size ? Does it really matter ? The huge SUV does give the angry driver a larger weapon to threaten you with ! <p> What does matter is that these large vehicles greatly increase traffic congestion and pollution while increasing the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUVs have been popular they have wiped out the environmental gains of the last decade . <p> The story is somewhat different in Europe where all the manufacturers are building very comfortable , very safe , and very small cars . <p> Remember ? Ford is the company that gave us the Edsel and the exploding Pinto that incinerated great numbers of people . Their accountants informed management that it would save money to pay the injury and death claims rather than change the design , so they continued to put all Pinto owners at risk . Now Ford is going to build a monster that will put you and everyone else at risk ! <p> REX BURNETT <p> Sea Ranch <p> . <p> ROBOT COMMISSIONERS <p> Editor  --  It was interesting to note at the June 17 meeting of the Parking Commission ( as reported in the June 19 Chronicle ) that Commissioner Sharon Bretz acknowledged that the commission " works for the mayor . " I thought they worked for the citizens of San Francisco . <p> During hearings regarding the proposed North Beach garage , the commissioners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , meaningful objections to that ill-advised project . <p> Commissioner Bretz then got a taste of her own medicine when she alone tried to interest the other commissioners in a robotic garage ; they heard but did not listen . She finally gave up her conviction , and voted with the other loyal commissioners . <p> One wonders what the point of this charade is . Why hold public meetings if mayoral decree determines the outcome ? <p> One also wonders about the mayor 's priorities . He encourages subsidizing the auto while discouraging CalTrain 's proposed extension . Whatever happened to Transit First ? <p> HERB KOSOVITZ <p> Member of STOP ( Snarled Traffic Obstructs Progress ) <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WHAT ABOUT ME ? <p> Editor  --  I really ca n't believe all the attention Micha Papp ( aka " Manny " ) has received over his release from jail . I guess we should all get busted for pot and skipping probation . We would then have movie roles coming our way . I have tried to do my best paying off my college loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . However , I guess the best way to get ahead is to be a bum and hang out on a window ledge . <p> It does n't really matter if you have any talent or intelligence anymore , but a look . I wonder about The Chronicle nowadays and their devotion to such pop- culture diversions . There are a lot of young people out here that deserve the breaks and attention that " Manny " treats as an afterthought . Diggity dank ? Yeah , I can dank . I can also do a heck of a lot more than that . <p> BRIAN DOAN <p> Davis
