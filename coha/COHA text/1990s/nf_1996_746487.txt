Although people 65 years of age and older are a majority of the world 's visually impaired population ( Royal New Zealand Foundation for the Blind , 1990 ) , they receive a proportionally small amount of the services available ( Orr , 1992 ) , including mobility services ( Uslan , Hill , &; Peck , 1989 ) . As a result , information about orientation and mobility training for these people is limited ( Straw , Hourly , &; Zimmerman , 1991 ) . <p> The mobility services that are provided to this age group generally appear to be modified or scaled-down versions of the traditional orientation and mobility program ( Hill &; Hill , 1991 ; LaGrow &; Blasch , 1992 ) , which was originally designed to meet the needs of young , adventitiously blinded veterans ( Joffee &; Rikhye , 1991 ) and to achieve the greatest possible degree of independence in travel . Typically , O &M; instructors set goals somewhere along a continuum from dependence to independence based on their understanding of the ability and desires of the individual client . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complexity and also placed them on a continuum . These goals generally are set for route travel ; semi-independent or independent travel in familiar or unfamiliar indoor , residential , semi-business , or business environments ; or in all environments ( LaGrow , 1993 ) . <p> These levels reflect assumptions about the requirements of independent travel that are based on a task analysis of the skills required to achieve an ideal level of functioning  --  traveling in any environment , familiar or unfamiliar , by foot or public transportation , or both , with minimal assistance from others . This ideal may bear no relationship to the way people actually function . <p> This disconnection between the ideal and reality may be especially true for older people , whose needs probably are functionally different from those of younger people ( Hill &; Hill , 1991 ) . Their travel habits and patterns differ from those of younger people ( Robinson , 1993 ) ; they tend to go out less often and to walk less than younger people ( Long , McNeal , &; Griffin-Shirley , 1990 ; Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life , but they may restrict their activities outside of the home for fear of crime ( Hendricks , 1992 ) . Their outside involvement may have different , more personalized patterns from those of younger people . <p> These patterns may be identified through peer sampling , that is , identifying and sampling how a peer group carries out its interests . The peer group may consist of people who perform these activities adequately ( i.e. , a normative group ) or exceptionally ( i.e. , an exemplar group ) ( LaGrow , Prochnow-LaGrow , Brine , &; Ericson , 1992 ) . <p> The peer group is selected for comparative purposes and is meant to be representative of a particular individual and his or her personal patterns and preferences . As a result , an instructor may view the behavior of the peer group as a standard for setting instructional goals , planning programs , and evaluating outcomes ( Baer , Wolf , &; Risley , 1987 ; Kazdin , 1982 ; Van Houten , 1979 ) . <p> In this study we used exemplar peer sampling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three older visually impaired people . We did this to determine if the ideal level of functioning identified through peer sampling is different from that implicitly used in traditional orientation and mobility programs . Method Participants <p> Three visually impaired individuals participated in this study . Participant 1 was an 84-year-old man who lives with his wife in their own home in a rural town of about 15,000 people . Glaucoma has caused significant loss in vision ( O.S. NLP , O.D. 6/18 , and a visual field of less than 20 degrees at its widest angle ) . A stroke and heart disease limit his physical activity . Participant 2 was a 79-year-old woman who lives alone in her own home in a regional center of approximately 70,000 people . She , too , has a significant loss in vision from glaucoma ( O.S. 6/18 , O.D. HM , and a visual field of less than 20 degrees at its widest angle ) . She also has osteoarthritis and recurring attacks of angina , which limit the amount of walking she is willing or able to do . Participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home in a coastal city of about 40,000 people . She has a significant loss in vision ( O.D. HM , O.S. 6/60 ) caused by macular degeneration , but no other major health or functional difficulties . Procedures <p> We asked each participant to nominate three friends or acquaintances whom they considered " to be exceptionally independent in getting about the community . " We told the participants that talking with these people would " help us understand what it meant to be an active and independent person when one gets older " and was part of a research project investigating the upper limits of independent travel among their peers . <p> We then contacted the peers to tell them the purpose of the study and who had nominated them for participation and to set up appointments for an interview . All the nominees accepted . Thus , we formed three-member peer groups for the 3 participants in this study . <p> We interviewed the peers independently in their residences . We asked them to identify all the places they generally went on a weekly , biweekly , monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , walked , drove , were driven , took a bus or taxi ) . The peers ' responses were read back to them at the conclusion of the interview to ensure that the events recorded were complete , true , and accurate . <p> Two interviewers were present for two of the nine interviews ( 22% ) to ensure continuity in questioning and style as well as integrity of the interview process . These interviewers compared notes following each of the two interviews to ensure that the answers that had been given were recorded reliably . No disagreements were noted . Results <p> All of the peers were women with normal sight who lived in the participants ' local community . They were all younger than those who nominated them , lived in their own homes ( i.e. , not in a nursing or community care home ) , and most ( i.e. , 8 of 9 ) lived in the same circumstances as those who had nominated them ( i.e. , alone or with a spouse ) . All but one continued to drive her own car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Participant 1 , an 84-year-old man living with his wife , nominated three women who ranged in age from 70 to 73 . They lived with their spouses ; two drove their own cars . The one who did not drive lived with her husband , who did drive . Weekly , each woman drove herself ( or in the one case was driven ) to town for groceries or to pay bills and to church . All of them attended some form of recreation or club activity each week . One of the peers participated in a twice-weekly aerobics class , to which she walked . They all volunteered in nursing homes or visited older people in their homes or took them on outings . In addition , two worked in a charity shop two to three times a week . Only one visited friends or relatives on a regular basis ( the others stated that their families came to them ) . Two walked regularly ( i.e. , two to three times a week ) . One walked to the shop where she volunteered ; the other walked twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , a 79-year-old female who lives alone , nominated three women , aged 72 to 74 , all of whom lived alone and drove their own cars . They regularly ( once every 1 or 2 weeks ) went to town to shop , buy groceries , or pay bills They attended church fairly regularly ( i.e. , from three to four times per week to once per month ) . They also visited elderly people or took them for an outing on a weekly basis . Only one was involved in regular recreational or club activities . They drove to all these activities . Two did a little walking each day : One went to a local shop for milk and the paper ; the other walked her dog around the neighborhood . <p> Participant 3 , a 73-year-old female who lives alone , nominated two women who lived alone and one who shared her house with another woman . These women ranged in age from 67 to 73 and drove their own cars . All three went to town to shop or pay bills on a regular basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in recreational or leisure-time activities on a semiregular basis ( i.e. , from one to five times per month ) and visited friends and relatives on a semiregular basis ( i.e. , from two to three times per week to once a month ) . All also walked regularly ( i.e. , from once daily to twice weekly ) . Two walked on the beach with their dog and other people ; one walked to a shop for the paper and milk a couple times a week . Discussion <p> All the nominees to the peer groups proved to be busy and active people , as we would expect from an exemplar group of independent travelers . They all tended to be younger than those who nominated them and frequently traveled away from their homes . They all had normal sight ( obviously the participants did not limit their concept of those who constitute their peer group to visually impaired individuals ) . Eight of the nine drove ; the ninth had ready access to a driver . They traveled mostly by car , tending to restrict their walking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking the dog , or exercising . Other than shopping and paying bills , trips were for visiting others , including volunteer visits to or outings with older people , attending church and related activities , and participating in clubs or other social-recreational activities . One group did a fair amount of recreational walking . No peers traveled in unfamiliar environments , nor did they appear to travel to a wide variety of destinations . They had a very regular and predictable pattern of travel . <p> All the peers could be classified as independent travelers in familiar business environments . Yet , in these cases , this classification may not have its traditional meaning . Generally , we would assume that an independent traveler in familiar business environments would require a whole host of skills and techniques , including , at a minimum , travel in residential , semibusiness , and business environments ; crossing streets at controlled intersections ; planning routes of travel to locate familiar objectives ; and detouring . However , such an assumption would not necessarily hold for a visually impaired person functioning at the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel identified here relies upon reaching the destination by car . A visually impaired person could accomplish this by traveling with friends , by taxi , volunteer drivers , or scheduled transport ( e.g. , Dial-a-Ride or Mobility Inc . ) . Most informants dismissed buses as being too hard to get to , get on , and get off . <p> The most advanced travel techniques required to match the travel patterns identified in this study would probably be those used in one 's own neighborhood for exercise and occasional trips to the local shops . The use of a human guide or a limited range of cane techniques , or both , would probably be sufficient for most of the travel done . This finding is quite consistent with what older people often claim to be their need ( Hill &; Hill , 1991 ) . <p> When older people call on an agency for help with transportation , that is literally what they often want and expect rather than extensive orientation and mobility instruction ( Hilton , Ellis , Genwright , Miller , &; Stern , 1992 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of transportation and some basic skills may indeed lead to important changes in the quality of a person 's life ( Crews , 1991 ) . <p> We need more investigation into this question . Much of it could be done over time with numerous participants , using peer sampling methods . These methods could be used to set goals and investigate the outcome of the programs that agencies provide . The programs may prove to be quite different than those provided for younger people . This may prove to be especially true if those people offering the service provided convenient transportation rather than asking individuals to walk or use public transportation as the primary mode of travel . <p>
