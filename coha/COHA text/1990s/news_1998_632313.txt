<p> First-time home buyers can still afford a few places in Lake County , but they had better hurry . <p> Their best chances probably are in the far northwest corner of the county around Antioch , Lindenhurst , Round Lake and Lake Villa . Housing starts are actually dropping in some other places , such as Grayslake and Waukegan . <p> It 's getting to the point where many people who work in the county ca n't afford to live there . And , if they can , they ca n't get around on a road system that was built for fewer cars and a slower pace of living . <p> Prices on the rise <p> " The new-home prices are raising very rapidly , " said Wally Davis , regional director of Midwest Planning Corp. , in Schaumburg . " The new homes are going away in the lower price ranges . The available land for houses under $ 200,000 is diminishing very quickly . " <p> The prices of all homes  --  new and resale  --  rose faster in Lake than in other area counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey for 1997 . Average prices of homes sold were up 7.7 percent to $ 213,700 . That means the average monthly mortgage payment was $ 1,296 . <p> Owning that " average " new home in the county would take a family income of about $ 60,000 to $ 75,000 , Davis said . <p> Meanwhile Chicago Title &; Trust also reported the median income in Lake County increased by about 12.6 percent in 1997 to $ 76,000 from $ 67,500 . <p> " The supply of obtainable housing is getting tough , " Davis said . " The folks in the southern part of the county have been squeezed out , and we are pushing them into Lake Villa , Lindenhurst , Antioch and Round Lake . There is still quite a bit of attainable housing there in the $ 120,000-to-$ 180,000 price range . <p> " There 's a lot of concern by the local employers , " Davis said . " That young technician at Abbott Labs or Baxter Labs , making $ 40,000 or $ 50,000 a year , is going to be squeezed out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This rapid growth has put a strain on the road system and the water and sewer utilities in many areas , according to Tim Angell , Lake County 's senior planner . <p> Gas tax might help <p> " Our east-west access here is really bad , " Angell said . " One thing is the lack of a gas tax in this county . If there was a gas tax , the county department of transportation would have more money to open up east-west access and to maintain roads , widen roads and build roads . <p> " We are still very much a rural or suburban county when it comes to the traffic grid , " he said . " The grid that was passable in 1980 or 1985 can not handle that traffic volume now , and it 's getting worse . " <p> One proposal to ease the north-south flow is to extend Illinois 53 from the Lake/Cook County line north though the center of the county to Illinois 120 near Grayslake , with a link to the Tri-State Tollway . <p> Construction down <p> While prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county actually is declining , Angell said , as some municipalities step back and take a cautious look at further growth . <p> " The total of new residential housing ( building ) permits issued in 1997 was down 9 percent , " he said , " from 4,786 in 1996 to 4,348 in 1997 . <p> " Our municipalities that experienced a lot of growth in the 1990s are slowing down , " he said . " Some officials are saying that maybe they built too fast so they are a little more reluctant to provide subdivisions that have 200 or 300 units . " <p> Grayslake , for example , dropped from 710 new permits in 1996 to 365 in 1997 , Waukegan went from 464 to 393 and Mundelein dropped from 354 to 218 , according to preliminary U.S. Census figures , he said . <p> Water and sewer systems are filling up too fast and must be expanded , he said . <p> Business and industries need to go to the " municipalities that have stringent regulations and building codes to say , ' Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have people afford to work in this county where they live , ' " Angell said . <p> Edward F. Havlik is president and CEO of United Homes , one of the major builders in Lake County . He also is the 1998 president of the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago . <p> Plan needed <p> The problems and potentials are great enough that builders , developers and county officials and planners should sit down and develop a plan for further growth , Havlik said . <p> He pointed to the situation in suburban Plainfield where builders met with local school district officials to work on funding methods and fees for new schools that did not affect builders unreasonably . <p> " We , as builders and developers , need to focus on the realities of transportation and open space , " he said . " There is logically a pattern of acquisition and development for open spaces as well as commercial and residential priority . " <p> Home prices continue to escalate because the county and some municipalities require " ever increasing lot sizes " and constantly increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that will happen in an increasing way is that people in the building business will discover the value of reuse , " Havlik said . " It may be in the core city  --  Chicago  --  or any other other great urbanized areas that exist , like downtown Waukegan , downtown Elmhurst or downtown anywhere . <p> " Probably , half of the suburbs have downtowns that they would love to see resurrected into meaningful economic cores , " he said . " That urbanization takes the pressure off of further-out suburbs and transportation and roads . " <p> Davis said that the lack of lower-priced new housing has boosted the sales of existing housing by five or six percent . <p> Resales doing well <p> " The resale market did quite well last year , with interest rates so low and apartment rents so high , " he said . " A lot of young couples could afford to buy . Now that we ca n't supply so much housing , so they are forced to buy resale or to stay in apartments . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful single-family-home developments in Lake County last year with 121 sales ranging from about $ 155,500 to $ 229,000 , said Douglas Brown , Lexington Homes president and CEO . <p> When all of the homes at the Links of English Meadows are sold , Lexington wo n't have another similar development to offer , but they would have liked to , Brown said . <p> " That may be caused by the difficulty getting things approved , " he said . " Right now , it takes longer to get things approved by the municipalities . " <p> Smaller , less-expensive housing can not be built , in many cases , because of restrictions on lot sizes and density , Brown said . <p> The affordable homes are still out there , according to Ted Pickus , president of the Lake County Home Builders Association , and vice president of North Shore Development . <p> Some young professional couples are waiting until they can make the down payment on a larger home that they wo n't have to move out of soon , like those at Tantara in Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pickus said . <p> " At Tantara , I had a younger couple of professionals . They are going into a first home , but they are starting at the top . They have saved their money . They do n't have children yet . They want space , " he said . <p> Range of prices <p> At Cedar Crossing , in Lake Villa , prices are spread across a wide range , starting at about $ 140,000 , in order to appeal to a wide range of buyers , said Mark Buschman , vice president of Buschman Homes . <p> " We have plans that appeal to a large variety of buyers  --  move-down buyers and quite a few move-up buyers , and a few first-time buyers . We have a lot of families , " he said . <p> " We get a lot from the county , " he said . " About 20 to 25 percent are from a 10-mile area . We do get quite a few from the northwest suburbs and the North Side of Chicago . " <p> In Wauconda , Saddlewood Associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Saddlewood development of 81 semi-custom homes . <p> The 2-story-home designs are in the $ 243,000-to-$ 350,000 range . Again , they are large layouts , with 1,985 to 3,185 square feet . <p> To preserve the woodsy rural nature of Wauconda , the houses and streets are being built through and around the existing trees , some of them 150 years old . <p> With a projection of an eventual 2,100 units of housing , Gregg 's Landing in Vernon Hills will play a big part in the county housing picture into the new millennium . <p> The production homes by the Zale Group ( also the site 's developer ) and four other builders range from about $ 300,000 to $ 550,000 . Custom homes are about $ 700,000 and up .
