Our annual list of holiday gift suggestions from distinguished readers and writers . BOB BARR <p> I am delighted and honored to have you solicit my recommendations for Christmas books for the upcoming season : Slouching Towards Gomorrah , by Robert H. Bork . While the writing style is decidedly upscale , and frequently requires college-level reading skills , Judge Bork 's treatise remains the best road map for understanding American society on the dawn of the twenty-first century . Rising Tide , by John M. Barry . For a change of pace , this book , which chronicles the massive changes to American society as a result of the massive Mississippi Flood of 1927 , makes for an extremely interesting and reliable historical study . Boy Clinton , by R. Emmett Tyrrell , Jr . Still the definitive work on understanding who Bill Clinton is and why he does the things he does . Without Honor , by Jerry Zeifman . Required reading for all who seek to understand the debate concerning impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton . <p> Bob Bart is a U.S. congressman from Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not much esteemed by your American Spectator reviewers , I will be audacious enough to recommend my Shakespeare : The Intention of the Human , which was published October 26 by Riverhead Books of Penguin Putnam ( 750 pages , $35 ) <p> Literary study , as you know , no longer exists in Anglo-American academies ; instead we get Resenters who call themselves feminists , Marxists , New Historicists , Deconstructors  --  the usual rabblement . Shakespeare particularly suffers from this nonsense : Our students are given " French Shakespeare "  --  the abominable Foucault . My book is intended to dismiss all this , and instead address the common reader and common playgoer , returning us to the concern with Shakespeare 's characters of Dr. Johnson , Hazlitt , and A.C. Bradley . I give interpretations of all the plays , centering upon Shakespeare 's invention of personality as we continue to know it . <p> Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and Berg Professor of English at New York University . PATRICK J. BUCHANAN <p> In the course of writing a book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , some of which were also delightful . <p> In the latter category , Marquis James 's 1939 Life of Andrew Jackson , while perhaps not the " definitive " biography , is surely among the most readable ever written-about a truly heroic American as great as Washington as a man , leader , and warrior , if not as a president . <p> For one overview of U.S. diplomacy and foreign policy that can be read and enjoyed at a chapter a night , I would recommend Robert H. Ferrell 's 1959 American Diplomacy : A History . Were all American histories used in our colleges written as well , our people would not be so broadly uninformed as to the glory and greatness-and follies  --  of America 's past . <p> For a brief and tough-minded critique of Theodore Roosevelts neo-imperialism and Woodrow Wilson 's internationalism , which makes the case for an America First " Continentalism " that may after some debacles and tragedies  --  become U.S. foreign policy by default early in the new century , let me commend A Foreign Policy for America 1940 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reading list , I commend two books of essays on the consequences of Wilsonism and imperialism , over which Americans might ponder , as we go marching into the New World Order : The Costs of War , John Denson , editor ; and The Failure of America 's Foreign Wars , published by the Future of Freedom Foundation in Fairfax , Virginia . Both came out first in 1997 . <p> Patrick J. Buchanan , co-host of CNN 's " Crossfire , " is author of The Great Betrayal : How American Sovereignty and Social Justice Are Being Sacrificed to the Gods of the Global Economy ( Little , Brown ) . GEORGE W. BUSH <p> When I was growing up , I preferred reading biographies about historical figures and baseball players . I still enjoy books about history , especially Texas history : The Raven : A Biography of Sam Houston , by Marquis James , is one of my favorites . <p> I also like studying forces that helped shape today 's economy and social structure . The Good Life and Its Discontents : The American Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Samuelson , and The Dream and the Nightmare : The Sixties ' Legacy to the Underclass , by Myron Magnet , each provide food for thought and discussion . <p> Laura and I often read to our daughters when they were young . One of their top requests was The Very Hungry Caterpillar , by Eric Carle . A few more of my favorite books for children are : Sarah 's Flag for Texas , by Jane Alexander Knapik ; lames and the Giant Peach , by Roald Dahl ; My Side of the Mountain , by Jean Craighead George ; Tuck Everlasting , by Natalie Babbitt ; The Wind in the Willows , by Kenneth Grahame ; lust So Stories , by Rudyard Kipling . <p> Our capacity for discover ) , is never lost as long as we continue to read . <p> George W. Bush is governor of Texas . TERRY EASTLAND <p> Anything by C.S. Lewis , given that this is the 100th anniversary of his birth . An Experiment in Criticism , one of Lewis 's less well-known books , is a cogent inquiry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a fine meditation on good reading , " the necessary condition " of which , he reminds , is " to get ourselves out of the way . " Another less well-known work of Lewis is The Weight of Glory , a collection of five addresses that was first published in 1949 . Three of these are sermons , so here you can see the preacher in Lewis , and the preacher is excellent indeed . A very well-known Lewis book  --  and one worth rereading in our ongoing era of moral chaos-is The Abolition of Man , published in 1943 and still the best argument in behalf of objective morality . <p> Speaking of moral chaos , David Wells 's Losing our Virtue , out this year from William B. Eerdmans , is an excellent analysis of morally adrift postmodem man ( and woman ) . Wells , of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary , is one of the few outstanding theologians worthy of the title . His book is ultimately addressed to especially evangelical churches , which in his ( I think correct ) view have absorbed many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I should mention Robert Penn Warren 's All the King 's Men , our greatest political novel . Here is the start of chapter four , with Jack Burden narrating the origins of this bit of oppo research : " The Boss said to me , ' There is always something . ' And I said , ' Maybe not on the Judge . ' And he said , ' Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud . There is always something . ' And he told me to dig it out , dig it up , the dead cat with patches of fur still clinging to the tight swollen , dove-gray hide .... " <p> Finally , I recommend Alexander Bickel 's The Morality of Consent , published posthumously in 1975 . His analysis of " the age of assaultive politics " that led to Watergate is worth recalling as the president , a son of that era , faces impeachment . Bickel 's thoughts defy easy summary , but they confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics . " We can not survive a politics of moral attack , " he wrote . " And the highest morality almost always is the morality of process . " <p> Terry Eastland is publisher of TAS . His books include Energy in the Executive and Ethics , Politics , and the Independent Counsel . SUSAN ESTRICH <p> Royal Blood : Richard III and the Mystery of the Princes ( 1998 ) , by Bertram Fields . The real rush to judgment , and the crystal brilliance of what a legal mind can do . <p> Kaaterskill Falls ( 1998 ) , by Allegra Goodman . My gift for my Jewish women friends . <p> Corelli 's Mandolin ( 1994 ) , by Louis de Bemieres . People actually stopped me when I was reading this book to tell me how good it was . I wound up giving my copy away . <p> Love Invents Us ( 1997 ) , by Amy Bloom . A wonderful treat if you do n't know her work . <p> Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant , which he had to write for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book club , lucky for me . <p> Susan Estrich , a nationally syndicated columnist , teaches law and political science at the University of Southern California . ORRIN G. HATCH <p> I highly recommend the recently released novel The Locket , by fellow Utahn Richard Paul Evans . At a time of year when family relationships and the legacies of our elders mean so much , this book will be especially heartwarming . It is a beautifully written story . <p> I imagine many contributors will name Charles Dickens 's A Christmas Carol , proving not only that it is a holiday staple , but also that its message continues to be important for our time . <p> And , of course , our seventeen grandchildren would be disappointed if I did not include How the Grinch Stole Christmas and The Littlest Angel on the list of must reading . <p> Orrin G. Hatch is the senior senator from Utah . STEPHEN HESS <p> The madness of World War I is the fitting subject of English novelist Pat Barker 's riveting trilogy . Be sure to start with Regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though The Ghost Road won a Booker Prize . <p> Fellow mystery fans , discover Donna Leon , an American living in Italy , where Venice is the scene of her crimes . She has written six books starring Commissario Brunetti , including Death at La Fenice and The Death of Faith . They are hard to come by ( some are only published in London ) , but worth the effort <p> From fiction to fact . Read Bombshell , by foreign correspondents Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstell . They start digging in Moscow 's KGB files and end knocking on a door in Cambridge , England , where they coax a virtual confession from Ted Hall , an American who delivered atomic secrets to the Soviets . <p> Two memoirs that I truly would never have read without the help of friends and which gave me new insights into language are Lost in Translation , by Eva Hoffman , and The French Lesson , by Alice Kaplan . <p> A great stocking-stuffer is The Glory of Their Times , Lawrence Ritter 's account of the early days of major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who were there . <p> Stephen Hess , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , is author most recently of The Little Book of Campaign Etiquette ( Brookings ) . DAVID HOROWlTZ <p> From Plato to NATO , by David Cress , is a brilliant history of the Western idea , which is currently under assault from the left . By critiquing what he calls the Grand Narrative of Western liberalism , he shows how and why it folded so easily into leftism in the postwar period . By re-establishing the culture of Western democracy in its actual historical development , he provides insights into the contemporary culture wars that no one else has . An education in itself . <p> My favorite novel of the last two years is Philip Roth 's American Pastoral , which confronts the American fifties with the radical sixties and is more ruthless in its rejection of the latter than anything even Peter Collier and I have written . Thoroughly overlooked by conservative critics , it will make a satisfying gift for any conservative reader . <p> Friedrich Hayek 's Socialism and War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Chicago Press ) . The essay " The Intellectuals and Socialism " is the most perceptive look at the adversary culture , outside of Von Mises 's The Anti-Capitalist Mentality , that I have ever seen . <p> David Horowitz , president of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture , is author most recently of The Politics of Bad Faith : The Radical Assault on America 's Future ( Free Press ) . PAUL JOHNSON <p> Graham Robb 's Victor Hugo ( Picador ) is the best biography of a literary hero I have read in years . There is nothing half so good in French . Hugo was one of the most creative people who has ever lived and , like many imaginative writers , a bit of a fraud too . He was also a womanizer on a scale which makes Clinton look very amateurish , but , unlike Clinton , he really liked women and understood them , and enhanced their lives . He comes vividly to life in this excellent book . <p> Robert Remini , who has written so well about Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Daniel Webster : The Man and His Time ( Norton ) . A fine and thorough account of a formidable but flawed political giant . <p> Conquests and Cultures ( Basic Books ) is a highly original survey of what happens when one people subjects another to its cultural domination , written with great knowledge and assurance by Thomas Sowell , America 's greatest living philosopher-historian . <p> Paul Johnson 's most recent book is A History of the American People ( HarperCollins ) . BOB KERREY The Meadow , by James Galvin . For friends who admire the values of the West . Dark Sun : The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb , by Richard Rhodes . For friends who think freedom might be free . The Norton Anthology of Poetry . For friends who did not study poetry but need the thrill of words used by masters . Radetzky March , by Joseph Roth . For friends who believe the best writers were on the Top 100 list . A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , by James Joyce . For friends who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read something by Joyce which is comprehensible . When Memory Speaks : Reflections on Autobiography , by Jill Ker Conway . For friends who think you are a sexist pig . <p> Bob Kerrey is the senior senator from Nebraska . JOSEPH LIEBERMAN <p> The first book I would like to recommend is A Great and Glorious Game ( published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill ) , a captivating collection of essays about baseball by the late A. Bartlett Giamatti , a former president of Yale University , president of the National League , and , for a short time , Commissioner of Baseball . The collection is an erudite love letter to the game , keen in its memories of lost summer evenings at Fenway Park and of the self-possession of the game 's athlete-heroes . But it is more than that . Ultimately , Barfs baseball writings are a metaphor for American character and culture , for American life itself , and the moral consequences of everything that we do . <p> The second book on my list is Kaddish , by Leon Wieseltier ( published by Knopf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's year of mourning after the death of his father . Kaddish is a spiritual journey that limns the author 's broken heart but also revels in what he calls " the charisma of learning . " Although named for the mourner 's prayer , Kaddish is about renewal and hope and the intellectual resilience of traditional Judaism . <p> Joseph Lieberman is the junior senator from Connecticut . PAUL McHALE <p> A Sand County Almanac , by Aldo leopold . One of the finest and most evocative environmental works ever written , detailing the rebirth of an abandoned Wisconsin farm . <p> Iwo Jima : Legacy of Valor , by Bill Ross . One of the best works ever written about U.S. Marines in combat . <p> Grant and Lee , by J.F.C. Fuller . A superb study in military leadership which emphasizes the pivotal role of a commander 's character . <p> The Killer Angels , by Michael Shaara . Perhaps the single most moving and inspiring account of the battle of Gettysburg . <p> The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt , by Edmund Morris . A magnificent Pulitzer Prize-winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the presidency . <p> Fix Bayonets , by Col. John W. Thomason . A classic , insightful , often humorous analysis of U.S. Marines in the First World War . <p> Paul McHale is a U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania . EDMUND MORRIS <p> The testimony of a husband is always suspect , but if there has been a better biography published in the last eighteen months than Rage for Fame : The Ascent of Clare Boothe Luce , by Sylvia Jukes Morris , I would like to hear about it . <p> The best novel I read in 1998 appeared exactly half a century ago , and rightly won the Pulitzer Prize . It is James Gould Cozzens 's neglected masterpiece Guard of Honor , just reissued by the Modern Library . Cozzens was not then , and is not now , a writer to everyone 's taste ( although his By Love Possessed was a major best , seller in 1957 ) . Massively serious and sober , he reveled in realistic detail and pondered the human condition with a complete lack of sentimentality . His concerns were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and hard work . A sure bet for the Nobel Prize , he was toppled overnight at the climax of his career by a cabal of left-wing critics , who found him to be an intellectual and social snob and by no means a subscriber to the idles recues of the time . His reputation never recovered . Maybe it will , as a new generation of readers discovers Guard of Honor to be the finest American novel of World War II . <p> Last , as an example of the kind of unclassifiable small book that slips general attention , but works an immediate spell upon anybody who cares for pure hard prose , shot through with lyrical insights , I recommend Susan Brind Morrow 's The Names of Things : A Passage in the Egyptian Desert . Most writers describe the world with one , or perhaps two , senses : Ms. Morrow reacts with all five . Her evocation of dusk settling down over houseboats on the Nile is more erotic than all the lubricities of the Starr Report . <p> Edmund Morris , author of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan . SYLVIA JUKES MORRIS <p> Among the many superb novels I 've read this year , I particularly recommend Pat Barker 's World War I trilogy , comprised of Regeneration ( now a movie starring Jonathan Pryce ) , The Eye in the Door , and The Ghost Road , which won Britain 's prestigious Booker Prize in 1997 . With lean prose and searing imagery , Barker recounts the psychiatric treatment of shell-shocked soldiers , examines the impact on society of four years of senseless carnage , and the disillusionment of rehabilitated officers sent back in 1918 to finish a fight in which they had lost all faith . <p> If Barker ranks with Julian Barnes , Anita Brookner , and Penelope Fitzgerald as one of the best English fiction writers of our time , Dawn Powell is a comparable star in the American firmament or a generation before . Thanks to her champion Gore Vidal , and the Steefforth Press , eleven of Powell 's fifteen long-neglected novels are again in print . Of these I especially admire A Time to be Born , a witty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her mark in publishing circles of the early 1940 's . <p> For readers wanting to know more about Powell herself ( 1896q965 ) , Steerforth published selections from her brilliant diaries ( edited by Tim Page ) in 1995 . These were heralded by the New York Times as " one of the outstanding literary finds of the past quarter century . " Page has also written Dawn Powell : A Biography , a first-rate life of the novelist published to critical acclaim this fall by Henry Holt . <p> Sylvia Jukes Morris is author of Edith Kermit Roosevelt : Portrait of a First Lady ( 1980 ) and Rage for Fame : The Ascent of Clare Boothe Luee ( 1997 ) . V. S. NAIPAUL <p> I tend to look at old things that are always new , and in recent weeks I have arrived at a better appreciation for three great narrative writers , all of extraordinary immediacy , each writer 's idiosyncratic language and method catching the movements of his mind . The reader has to adapt to each writer 's pace . <p> Tacitus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A high imperial bureaucrat , a survivor of one terror , his subject ( in his account of Nero ) is another terror . Immediate and painful ( with all the elegance of the writer 's mind , and his high Roman arrogance ) , and not at all luscious . The Latin text ( with translation ) is in the fifth volume of the Loeb Classical Library Tacitus ( Harvard ) . There is also a very good translation by Michael Grant in the Penguin Classics . <p> Nikolai Gogol ( 1809-52 ) , the early Ukraine and Petersburg tales . Peasant ghost stories and oppressive urban fantasies , with all the freshness and excitement of things not written about before . There is a selection ( Diary of a Madman and other stories ) in the Penguin Classics , in a translation by Ronald Wilks . The Constance Garnett translations ( revised by Leonard J. Kent ) are in The Complete Tales of Nikolai Gogol ( Chicago ) . <p> Joseph Conrad ( 1857-1924 ) , A Personal Record , 1912 . From a Polish great-uncle retreating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant seaman in a London boarding house in 1889 getting started on his first book about the East Indies : 120 very rich pages of autobiography aiming to give " a coherent , justifiable personality " to a writer of " fundamentally dissimilar " books . In various editions . <p> V. S. Naipaul 's latest book is Beyond Belief : Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples ( Random House ) . BARBARA K. OLSON <p> The Death of Outrage : Bill Clinton 's Assault on American Ideals , by William J. Bennett . A point by point response : to the lies and half-troths delivered daily by the Clinton administration and its warriors . Unfortunately for author Bennett and the rest of us , the Clinton presidency is an unending source of outrage . <p> Lucky Bastard , by Charles McCarry . Dedicated to the author of The Manchurian Candidate , Lucky Bastard presents a spectacularly unlikely tale of a sex-obsessed president controlled by a foreign government through the president 's sexually frustrated and single-minded wife . Well , maybe unlikely , but just suppose .... <p> High Crimes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coulter . A terrific book to be placed next to the dictionary for quick reference whenever the president tries to explain his innocence . <p> Finally for those on our list after all the funds are spent ( it 's free with Internet access ) : " Investigation of Political Fundraising Improprieties and Possible Violations of Law Interim Report , " by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee . The true facts about what it took to re-elect the president . Sequel rights currently are under the control of Attorney General Reno . <p> Barbara K. Olson , a former federal prosecutor and congressional investigator , has been a frequent television commentator on the Clinton scandal . THEODORE B. OLSON Tomcat in Love , by Tim O'Brien . If we must continue to read about an emotionally-stunted , sex-crazed , self-absorbed , menopausal male , I suggest this delightful verisimilitudinous rendition in place of the sordid and utterly incredible version being published in the daily papers . Florence Harding , by Cad Sferrazza Anthony . A malignant White House , complete with intrigue , rampant adultery , intimidation squads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lady might bring such matters to a blissful ending . The Young Hamilton , by James Thomas Flexner . A tree story of a disturbed political genius whose early life as the child of a sexually wayward mother may have foredoomed a promising career in government . The Politics of Bad Faith , by David Horowitz . An exegesis on the metamorphosis of Marxist thought into modern leftism , and an explanation for why the Democratic Party has little left to say except that lying and obstruction of justice does not war rant impeachment . And , two must reads ( or rereads as the case maybe ) : Boy Clinton and The Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton , by the prescient and witty editor of this magazine , with an assist from " Anonymous " on Impeachment , in which the events of 1999 are miraculously foretold . <p> Theodore B. Olson is a Washington lawyer . JAROSLAV PELIKAN <p> Of course , modesty ( such as it is ! ) forbids my listing the books that I really hope people will give for Christmas . But here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin , The Proper Study of Mankind 0998 ) . A collection that includes " The Hedgehog and the Fox , " almost certainly the most provocative essay on Tolstoy ever written in any language , and , another of my favorites , the comparisons of Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt . There is n't a piece in this collection that I do n't wish I had written . <p> St. Augustine , The Confessions , translated by Sir Henry Chadwick ( 1991 ) . As Alexander Souter of Aberdeen once said , whether or not Augustine was the greatest of Latin writers , he was almost certainly the greatest man who ever wrote Latin- and nowhere more than in this luminous book , which created a new genre of literature and which acquires a new freshness in this splendid translation . And it is , after all , about the very things that make Christmas Christmas . <p> Johann Wolfgang yon Goethe , Faust , translated by Martin Greenberg ( part 1 , 1991 ; part 2 , 1998 ) . I have read Faust in German every year since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see things in the text that I never knew were there . <p> Jaroslav Pelikan is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University . His books include Mary Through the Ages ( Yale University Press ) and Jesus Through the Ages ( HarperCollins ) . LAURENCE SILBERMAN Guns , Germs 0 Steel : The Fates of Human Societies , by Jared M. Diamond . A stunning and original environmental explanation for the relative rate of development of human societies . Cold Mountain , by Charles Frazier . The best novel since Hemingway . A World at Arms : A Global History of World War II , by Gerhard L. Weinberg . A wonderful one-volume history which casts new light on the performance of the Soviet Army and includes various nuggets based on intelligence information . America in Black and White , by Abigail and Stephan Themstrom . A sober but optimistic view of race relations in the United States . Atypically honest for the subject . Moses : A Life , by Jonathan Kirsch . I was amazed at how rich a portrait the author paints . <p> Laurence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the District of Columbia Circuit . KEVIN STARR <p> In considering books to recommend for Christmas selections , I have endeavored to think in several categories and moods , since among your readers there are undoubtedly many devoted to fiction , others who prefer history and biography , and perhaps a saintly few who delve into poetry . I know women ( and a few men ) who prefer female authors , while others , indifferent to the sex of the author , desire primarily to devote their limited reading time to those authors of proven worth . <p> With these disparate priorities in mind , allow me to give you my list of ten books . <p> In the realm of contemporary fiction I offer two novels and two collections of short fiction . Susan Minot 's Evening , a novel of great subtlety , and finesse that looks back over the turbulence and disappointment of a woman 's life , is written in a prose as clear as crystal . This is a very moving and persuasive story . John Updike 's Bech at Bay , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of literary tricks . He has grown a little weary of Bech , but there is a curious marriage of sensibilities between the famous Protestant novelist and his fictional Jewish alter ego . Mary Gaitskill 's Because They Wanted To is a collection of stories that will in many cases appall the sensitive reader , but Gaitskill writes hauntingly of lives at the margins of society . She is our Maxim Gorky , a modern Dreiser . Another wonderful contemporary novelist is A.S . Byatt , whose novel , Possession , is a genuine tour de force fictional account of the lives of two nineteenth-century poets whose secrets are unearthed by a pair of present-day scholars . Possession is literary detective fiction of the highest caliber . <p> Going back a little further , I draw from the not-too-distant past two authors who represent in their very different ways the epitome of what fiction can accomplish . The first is Henry Green , whose novels  --  Loving , Living , and Party Going-were among the most distinctively stylized to come out of the literary ferment in England between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been published in one volume by Viking Penguin , and this trio of novels is delightfully quirky and insightful , although each stands apart from the other two both in terms of the material it treats and its manner of presentation . The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov , published in one volume by Random House in 1995 , is without question the best collection of short fiction published in English during the past twenty years . Nabokov was one of the great literary geniuses of our century , and these stories demonstrate the range of his imagination and evocative power . <p> For devotees of history , I suggest Simon Schama 's brilliant chronicle of the French Revolution , Citizens . Published in 1990 by Random House , this marvelous book , now in paperback , presents vivid vignettes of scores of characters , and it captures the rash of events that threw France into turmoil and changed the course of European history . I am always anxious to point readers toward Wallace Stegner 's superlative Beyond the Hundredth Meridian , an account of John Wesley Powell 's exploration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody has written about this region with the perception and the accuracy of Stegner , who was one of our greatest American writers since the Second World War . <p> Before his untimely death a couple years ago , Joseph Brodsky , winner of the Nobel Prize in poetry , performed an act of rare generosity in selecting and writing an introduction for the poetry of Thomas Hardy . Brodsky 's long introductory essay on Hardy makes it clear that the latter poet was one of the supreme artists of our language , a poet to be ranked with Wordsworth and Browning . Hardy is best known to most readers as the novelist who wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure . Less often is he acknowledged as a poet who could ring the language like a bell . Brodsky 's magnificent introduction goes a long way toward rectifying this oversight . The selection , The Essential Hardy , was published by Ecco Press in 1995 . <p> Harder to find , but well worth the effort , is a first collection of sonnets by a gifted new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the title , Levering Avenue , have just been published by the University of Evansville Press . The collection won the prestigious Richard Wilbur award and contains elegiac verse of poignancy and real wit . You will probably have to call or write to William Baer at the University of Evansville in Indiana to order copies . <p> Kevin Start is state librarian of California . KENNETH TOMLINSON <p> These are not the best of times for veterans of the Reagan Revolution . Impotence is so widespread in the ranks of congressional Republicans that we ca n't even restrain the global weenies at the International Monetary Fund , much less muster the force to enact tax cuts ( and tax reform ) to fuel another era of economic growth and prosperity . <p> About the only thing our players have done this year is make the Washington Redskins look good . As Casey Stengel said of his hapless New York Mets , " Ca n't anybody here play this game ? " <p> But just as we were about to throw in the towel , P.J. O'Rourke has delivered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restores focus and Reagan-like optimism to the field of battle . Apostles of the left , no matter where their solutions are applied , are wrong . Stupid . And we are right . Our ideas work . No matter how bumbling our political leadership , we must never allow ourselves to forget that . <p> " I had one fundamental question about economics , " explains P.J. " Why do some places prosper and thrive while others just suck ? It 's not a matter of brains . No part of the earth ( with the possible exception of Brentwood ) is dumber than Beverly Hills , and the residents are wading in gravy . In Russia , meanwhile , where chess is a spectator sport , they 're boiling stones for soup . Nor can education be the reason . Fourth graders in the American school system know what a condom is but are n't sure about 9 x 7 . Natural resources are n't the answer . Africa has diamonds , gold , uranium , you name it . Scandinavia has little and is frozen besides . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local mall are famous for lacking it .... " <p> The book is jammed with yucks . " There 's also a whiff of the highbrow in Siberia . For a hick town , Irkutsk had too many opera houses , theaters , museums , and academic institutes . This is because , for hundreds of years , the smarty-pants reformers , annoying idealists , and know-it-all do-gooders were sent here for life . It 's as though everyone who voted for George McGovern was packed off to Lubbock , Texas . A mixed blessing for the locals , as you can imagine . " <p> And sad irony . " My guide told me good farmland in Tanzania sells for a million shillings an acre , about $1650 . Since there are z9 million Tanzanians , $20 billion would have bought each family a larger-than-average farm lot , and everybody could have gone back to doing what they were doing before ujamaa the socialism imposed on Tanzania by Julius Nyerere was thought of . One more reason that Tanzania is poor is that we 've paid them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for college without this book . The job P.J. does on the teaching of economics in the university classroom is worth the price of a hardcover : " Paul Samuelson turns out to be almost as much of a goof as my friends and I were in the 1960 's . ' Marx was the most influential and perceptive critic of the market economy ever , ' Samuelson writes on page seven . Influential , yes . Marx nearly caused World War III . But perceptive ? ' " <p> Meanwhile , the state of politics in America ought to be enough to drive conservatives to pursue things eternal . For quite some time , I , for one , have sensed the need for a more rigorous pursuit of religion . In the newly published Tell Me Why : A Father Answers His Daughter 's Questions About God , Michael and Jana Novak have given us a book that serves this purpose . Without question Michael is one of the saints of this century . ( He happens also to be a fantastic sports fan . ) <p> But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beginning on page 309 is a chapter of recommended religious reading-from G.K. Chesterton to Elliott Abrams-that should engage the serious person in lifetime ( on earth ) pursuit of the mysteries of the Faith . <p> Finally , for any Republican who aspires to ascend to political leadership , I recommend a trip to the local library and Henry Mayer 's A Son of Thunder : Patrick Henry and the American Republic . <p> There you will find that it is possible for political leaders to frame the argument for liberty in language that will inspire people to support policies and actions that will indeed lead us to the promised land . But first , dear leadership , you must have no fear . <p> Kenneth Tomlinson , former editor-in-chief of Reader 's Digest and Reagan administration director of Voice of America , lives on a horse farm in Fauquier County , Virginia . R. EMMETT TYRRELL , JR . <p> Impeachment is in season , so send a Clintonite friend High Crimes and Misdemeanors , by Ann Coulter ( Regnery ) . It will remind the poor soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's misdeeds make him more impeachable than any of his ill-starred predecessors . <p> I should like to recommend four other books this year . V. S. Naipaul 's Beyond Belief . ' Islamic Excursions Among the Convetted Peoples ( Random House ) reports on Islam 's influence within countries that have not always been Islamic and have been inhabited by people who are non-Arabic and adhere to other faiths . As Naipaul is one of the finest writers at work today and one of the finest minds , the book is an intellectual feast . As Naipaul is a profoundly civilized man , it abounds with challenging ideas , the most interesting being his diagnosis of nihilism within these countries . Reporting on his journey through these countries , Naipaul combines a respect for traditional society with a proper skepticism about modernity . Not even an ayatollah is left with grounds for indignation . <p> Let me also suggest Eugene McCarthy 's No-Fault Politics : Modem Presidents , the Press , and Reformers ( Times Books ) , which was edited by Keith C. Burris . The book echoes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of often being right . For the last four years I have been taping a television show with LBJ 's old nemesis and come to admire him for his sense of the absurd and his independence . How he ever managed a career in American politics I can not say . Maybe his colleagues in the Senate did not know he was kidding . <p> A recent arrival is Jude Wanniski 's The Last Race of the 20th Century ( Polyconomics Inc. ) , a book about world issues that he thinks should have been resolved in the last election but were not thanks to what Wannish sees as an alliance between reactionaries , namely Republicans and Democrats . Wanniski specializes in contrarian views that he believes appropriate to a world dominated by global growth rather than the Cold War aggression of the past . Whether he is right or not I leave to Wanniski 's readers , all of whom will find some of their dearest ideas challenged here . <p> Finally let me recommend a book published in 1965 but still available in some bookstores , Winston Churchill : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flavorous prose and vivacious style by Violet Bonham Carter , a very clever woman who knew Churchill well , this book reminded me again that the century 's greatest Englishman ( born of an American mother ) is also limitlessly interesting , even to those of us who have read his life story a half-dozen times before . <p> R. Emmett Tyrrell , Jr . is editor-in-chief of The American Spectator and the author of Boy Clinton : The Political Biography ( Regnery ) and ( with " Anonymous " ) The Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton ( Regnery ) . KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL <p> In a year in which political life resembles ( bad ) literature , and in which Kenneth Starr 's puritan pornography tops the bestseller lists , I seek solace in Marguerite Yourcenar 's Memories of Hadrian . It is both a meditation upon history and a warning of what befalls a country when it loses its bearings in feuds and conspiracies . <p> For some real outrages ( and for those who consider Bill Bennett the real outrage ) read Jim Hightower 's There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dead Armadillos . It 's a passionate , funny look at exactly who 's screwing whom in America today . In the tradition of Will Rogers , Hightower , Texas 's former agriculture commissioner , lays out a vision of bottom versus top , not left versus right , politics and skewers the powers-that-be in America on behalf of what he calls the powers-that-ought-to-be  --  America 's workaday majority . <p> In Achieving Our Country : Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America , philosopher Richard Rorty urges the left to abandon spectatorship for action . He calls for " a moratorium on theory " in favor of developing practical proposals around which a reinvigorated left-liberal coalition can construct a political majority . I do n't agree with everything in this lively book , but Rorty is right to note that the left has too often been content with discussing , among itself , the theory of power while the right has been busy taking it . <p> It is fitting that in this year of economic world disorder and creeping self-doubt among the establishment , that the Nobel Prize in Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unequal ( and in many other books ) , is fundamental to understanding the political economy of inequality , and its extreme extension  --  famine . <p> For a cautionary tale about how important it is for a man and a woman to understand each other 's definitions of love , fidelity , commitment , and responsibility , I suggest A Transatlantic LoveAffair : Letters to Nelson Algren , by Simone de Beauvoir . <p> For anyone interested in Russia 's endless tragedy but unable to read any more accounts of its purported " transition " or of Boris Yeltsin 's health , there is Nikolai Bukharin 's How It All Began : The Prison Novel . The book was hidden in Stalin 's personal archives for nearly fifty years until retrieved by Bukharin 's American biographer Stephen P. Cohen ( and , I should add , my husband ) , who tells the secret history of the manuscript in his introduction . <p> Written in Lubyanka Prison while Stalin 's Bolshevik rival awaited his assigned role as a chief defendant at the 1938 Moscow Show Trial , the novel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . It can be read on several levels : As a vivid panorama of Russia on the eve of revolution ; as the story of a fairly typical intelligentsia family , always poor , but forever full of passionate dreams ; as the autobiography of Bukharin 's generation , which rose to power in 1917 , helped create the Soviet state , and was then destroyed by it ; as a reminder of how much but also how little has changed in a century of Russian history ; and as the last testament of a man who , though tormented almost daily and awaiting certain execution , somehow managed to write in barely a year four book-length manuscripts in his cell . The last one was this autobiographical novel , which was terminated short of completion by his execution . <p> Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor of The Nation . JOHN W. WHITEHEAD The Complete Poems and Plays : 1909-1950 , by T. S. Eliot . These literary works by the revolutionary poet are stimulating and will provoke thought . Understanding Media , by Marshall McLuhan . McLuhan was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , McLuhan will nevertheless challenge you . It , by Stephen King . King , in my opinion , is the Mark Twain of our era . This is his masterpiece . Lyrics 1962-1985 , by Bob Dylan . Dylan was the prophet of the sixties generation . His legacy as a poet , however , will live on into the next millennium . The Shock of the New , by Robert Hughes . This is Hughes 's , who is Time magazine 's art critic , best work and an excellent commentary on modern art . <p> John W. Whitehead is founder and president of the Rutherford Institute . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> <p> <p>
