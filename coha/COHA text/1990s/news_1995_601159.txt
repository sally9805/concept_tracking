<p> Unlike anything ever seen before in Congress , the first Republican-written federal budget plans would shrink the size of government with changes that touch the lives of virtually all Americans . <p> From ending mass transit subsidies for commuters , to scaling back health coverage for the elderly and poor , the plans House and Senate Republicans unveiled Tuesday are ambitious , if politically risky , attempts to deliver on the GOP promise to balance the federal budget by 2002 . <p> " The budget that we put before you presents hard choices , and I make no apologies for that , " said Senate Budget Commmittee Chairman Pete Domenici , R-N.M. , said . " The American people by overwhelming majorities . . . want a balanced budget . " <p> The proposals came under immediate attack from Democrats and others who protested the plan will hurt an entire generation in the name of budget-cutting . <p> But even Democrats gave credit to Domenici for producing a plan unprecedented in fiscal austerity and political boldness . <p> " I do n't agree with everything , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panel . " But I 've never seen anyone with the courage to do what you 've done . . . . At least you 're taking important steps in the right direction . " <p> House Republicans are following today with a similar seven-year budget blueprint . <p> One big difference : The plan unveiled in the House makes even bigger budget reductions to pay for $ 345 billion worth of tax cuts passed by the House . <p> The Senate GOP plan  --  without tax cuts  --  proposes cutting government spending by $ 961 billion over seven years , by Domenici 's own calculations . <p> Democrats say it should be compared to projected future growth , and contend the cuts total $ 1.2 trillion . <p> What 's actually been presented is a budget resolution , a document that does n't carry the full force of law but sets guidelines for Congress to follow in later spending . Actual decisions on program cuts will fall to other committees . <p> Domenici called for a special bipartisan committee to make the tough choices on Medicare , the health-care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cuts . <p> Congress has used spending limitations in recent years to hold down the growth of government . <p> But never before has this system of federal budgeting seen restraints so severe , and the GOP 's resolve to follow through will be strongly tested by the reaction once millions of beneficiaries realize their programs and benefits are on the chopping block . <p> For example , the proposed limits on Medicare are almost certain to mean both higher costs and less medical care for the elderly . The Clinton administration predicts the elderly would pay $ 900 a year more , on average , for health care . <p> " The level of Medicare and Medicaid cuts are breathtaking . . . a frontal attack on America 's families , " said Gene Glover , head of the National Council of Senior Citizens . <p> Although it is smaller than the health program for the elderly , Medicaid is targeted for even more dramatic reductions under the Domenici plan . Its growth , running over 10% a year , would be brought down to 4%  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe this is the time to get the federal government out of the Medicaid business , " said Domenici . <p> Advocates for the poor as well as health-care providers are ready to fight back , arguing the Medicaid program already provides too little . <p> Domenici 's plan does n't touch Social Security , although the House plan proposes slightly reducing annual cost-of-living increases . <p> The Senate plan also keeps the Pentagon budget close to current levels and continues pension programs to retirees . <p> Domenici also would cut $ 190 billion from almost all other levels of government  --  they would be cut an average of 18% from current levels . <p> But Democrats say that figure underestimates the enormity of reductions in those programs : When compared to projected future growth , the cuts total $ 250 billion dollars and approach 30% . <p> Domenici proposes killing off more than 100 agencies , including the Department of Commerce . House Republicans would cut 365 programs . <p> Some samples : Veterans Affairs hospitals would be frozen at current levels and new construction phased out . Loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Clinton 's Americorps volunteer program would be killed . Air traffic control would be turned over to private businesses . Amtrak would lose its federal subsidies . <p> Domenici 's budget is virtually certain to pass his committee nearly intact . But problems with his own party will come on the Senate floor , when Phil Gramm , R-Texas , will insist on tax cuts as well , as proposed by the House . <p> Democrats will fight the plan , using the opportunity to score political points by complaining about the effect on tens of millions of Americans . <p> But Democrats are put in an uncomfortable spot because they do n't have an alternative that produces enough savings  --  without raising taxes  --  to end $ 200-billion-a-year deficits . The only Democratic proposal on the table is President Clinton 's , which envisions even more federal borrowing and has few defenders . <p> Tough fights lie ahead over individual spending bills that follow the budget blueprint , and an omnibus reconciliation bill that locks the budget into law and probably also incorporates welfare reform and block grant proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if Republicans are right in believing their 1994 election mandate reflects a new public willingness to make the sacrifices necessary to end the flow of red ink . <p> Long , winding road to a budget The budget packages unveiled Tuesday by Republicans kick into high gear a lengthy process needed to produce a budget for 1996 and the next six years . <p> The first step came when President Clinton proposed his budget in January  --  a document largely ignored by Congress . The Republican versions are a month late ; full budget resolutions ( setting targets for spending ) were supposed to be approved by April 15 . <p> This date is often missed , though , and the GOP plans will be voted on in the House and Senate budget committees this week . Once approved , they will go to the full House and Senate . Clinton does not have to sign the final blueprint , which has no force of law . <p> The budget process then splits into two tracks : <p>  --  Appropriations : Thirteen subcommittees in each house will make specific spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not including entitlements . Those bills must be agreed upon by both houses and ultimately signed by Clinton by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year . If not , a continuing resolution is needed to keep the government operating . <p>  --  Reconciliation : The House and Senate tax-writing committees decide the rest  --  how much to spend on entitlement programs such as Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid , and how much to raise in taxes . Those bills also must be reconciled ( agreed upon by both houses ) and signed by the president . <p> How Senate plan differs with current law <p> Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici , R-N.M. , unveiled a plan Tuesday that he says would balance the federal budget by fiscal year 2002 . He would spend $ 961 billion less than current law calls for by slowing the growth of Medicare and Medicaid and other programs . Comparing the Senate plan spending to that of current law : <p> Deficit projections Public debt would grow by $ 760 billion less under Domenici plan . <p> Projected spending Domenici plan spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 256 billion less . <p> Medicaid Domenici plan spends $ 175 billion less . <p> Interest on debt Domenici plan spends $ 155 billion less . <p> Welfare , food stamps , nutrition programs Domenici plan spends $ 83 billion less .
