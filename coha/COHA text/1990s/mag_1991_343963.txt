Michel Bloch wanted to retire to a quiet Jewish community with cheap housing and excellent security . Five months ago , he found what he was looking for in an enclave amid 750,000 largely destitute and rebellious Palestinians in one of the most densely populated areas in the world : the Gaza Strip . " There is no place else like this , " says Bloch , 57 , as he tends the spacious sea-view garden of his $70,000 two-bedroom duplex . " It 's a real paradise . " <P> That illusion is shared by 3,000 other Jewish settlers in the posh enclosures who rely on barbed wire , army roadblocks and heavy government subsidies to make a point : they want the Gaza Strip to remain under Israeli control and insist that their Palestinian neighbors living under military occupation learn to love it  --  or leave it . <P> Nearly 230,000 Jews are now ensconced in the occupied territories . If Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir gets his way , tens of thousands more will soon follow . As the U.S. struggles to nurse a postwar peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the largest Jewish settlement drives since Israel captured the West Bank , East Jerusalem , the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war . Ostensibly , the building boom is needed to house a growing settler population . But it is really meant to strengthen the Jewish state 's claim to the territories prior to any negotiations . If Shamir can stall long enough , he hopes to make Israel 's presence in the territories irreversible before peace talks even begin . Says Dedi Zucker , a left-wing Knesset member : " The idea is simply to destroy any chance that Israel will have to give up land for peace . " <P> Since the gulf war ended , three new settlements have been established in the West Bank , each coinciding with one of Secretary of State James Baker 's visits to the region . Last week the Peace Now group charged that the government is secretly planning to build nearly 30,000 additional units in the West Bank and Gaza . Housing Minister Ariel Sharon insists that the figure is closer to 13,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still increase the / Jewish population in the territories about 50% . He has also pledged to double the number of settlers from 12,000 to 24,000 in the Golan Heights , which Israel annexed in 1981 , and to expand Jewish neighborhoods in volatile East Jerusalem . <P> Last month Baker responded to Shamir 's latest snub by calling settlements the biggest " obstacle to peace . " President Bush followed up by warning that he might withhold $10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees that Israel wants to help absorb Soviet Jews unless Jerusalem agrees to a settlement freeze . As usual , Shamir was unimpressed by the threats . Speaking at the West Bank settlement of Beit Arieh last week , he dismissed any connection to peace talks and vowed that the construction drive " can not be stopped . " <P> The Prime Minister 's willingness to defy Washington is a well-calculated risk . Since 1968 , the U.S. has criticized Israeli settlements while significantly increasing financial aid . Last week the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected an amendment to cut $82.5 million  --  the amount the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual $3 billion aid package . Shamir expects that Congress will be increasingly reluctant to tangle with Israel as attention turns to the 1992 elections .
