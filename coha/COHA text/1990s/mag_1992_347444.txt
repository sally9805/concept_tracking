PERFORMER : BOB MARLEY <P> ALBUM : SONGS OF FREEDOM <P> LABEL : TUFF GONG/ISLAND <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : This is a Jamaican bumper crop of the last great soul music  --  and some of the best ever . <P> IF THIS WERE JUST A 78-SONG GREATest-hits package , it would be fine enough . If it were only an intense musical biography , it would be one of the most magical and darkly lyrical stories in the whole mythology of contemporary music . But beyond packaging , beyond biography , Songs of Freedom is a legacy  --  of a past that still permeates the musical present and points at the same time toward the future . It is also a memory of a time when music could be soulful , political , brutally honest , never divisive , and could still keep the beat . <P> In many ways , Bob Marley was the beat . He was the first superstar from the Third World . He popularized , even personified , the rhythm of reggae and its roots in the pitiless poverty and mystical spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sugarcane but cut like a switchblade . His love songs , like Guava Jelly , Stir It Up and Three Little Birds ( included here in a previously unreleased and altogether ravishing alternate version ) , were lighted with a sexual fervor suggesting that passion itself is a kind of temporary redemption . His political songs , whether metaphorical ( I Shot the Sheriff ) or straight-out and out-front ( War , with its lyric from a speech by Haile Selassie , and still one of the most devastating assaults on racism in all of rock ) , were sung with pride , without compromise , but from a musical spirit he was proud to share . His music could challenge the conscience , soothe the spirit and stir the soul all at once . Stir it right up . <P> Stir It Up , written to his wife during an eight-month separation , was typical Marley : seductive , soulful and coolly intemperate . The rhythm is easy but the lyrics insinuate , cajole , insist : sexual congress as hip sacrament . It was Marley 's unbridled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that gave him a kind of enigmatic , outlaw cast . In Jamaica he was not only a star , he was a political hero , a status that was confirmed by a medal from the U.N . and by the Jamaican Order of Merit , which he received in 1981 . But long before that , back in 1966 , his wife Rita had had a vision of stigmata on the palms of Haile Selassie and had begun to tutor Bob in Rastafari . <P> This religion had a deep impact on his music . For those outside its mysteries , Rastafari seemed to combine Old Testament mysticism and a kind of pan-African call to arms with a liberal indulgence in sacramental ganja , or pot . Ganja has a fearful potency , but it is n't as strong as Marley 's music . Rastafari remained arcane to most off-islanders , but Marley 's devotion to it produced the last great soul music . <P> This definitive introduction to  --  or reaffirmation of  --  Marley 's greatness ends with a live recording from his last concert in 1980 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cancer at 36 . Redemption Song is about betrayal and forgiveness , repression and rebirth ; it is a hymn of hope . That commodity may appear to be in short supply just now , but Songs of Freedom offers something close to a lifetime supply . And it does n't stint on the rhythm either .
