Darkness for some moments . Then we see Dalton sitting upstage , in a corner . His back is all we see . Beside him is a small candle . From the light of the candle , Dalton makes hand shadows . We can see the shadows but we can not discern what they are . DALTON CHANCE This is a horse . ( Makes a hand shadow ) This is a swan . No . Not a swan , shit . A falcon . Yeah . A falcon . No . There 's no claw . It 's a duck . ( Makes another hand shadow ) Now it 's a turtle . There 's the shell . But hell . It could be a fish . With a fin . ( He makes another hand shadow . Pace appears . She is there but not there . ) PACE CREAGAN That 's not a fish , Dalton Chance . You should know better . That 's a bird . A pigeon . The kind that live under the trestle . ( Dalton slowly turns and peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she is visible to us . He calls to her softly . ) DALTON CHANCE Creagan ? Pace Creagan ? Is that you ? ( He stands up . He cries out to her ) You go to hell , Pace Creagan ! ( Pace tips the candle over . Darkness. ) @x Months earlier , in the past . Pace and Dalton run to meet under the trestle at Pope Lick Creek . Pace gets there ahead of Dalton . They have been running and are both out of breath . DALTON CHANCE You had a head start ! PACE CREAGAN Nah . You have n't got any lungs in that puny chest of yours . Listen to you rattle . DALTON CHANCE I 'm not rattlin ' . PACE CREAGAN Yeah you are . What 've you got in there ? A handful of nails . DALTON CHANCE Twisted my ankle . PACE CREAGAN Yeah , yeah . DALTON CHANCE So this is it , huh ? ( They look up above them . ) PACE CREAGAN Yep . DALTON CHANCE It 's not that high up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . DALTON CHANCE Some creek . There 's no water : it 's dry . PACE CREAGAN Do n't care ; ca n't swim anyway . What time is it ? DALTON CHANCE Coming up to seven . p. 4 PACE CREAGAN Exact time . DALTON CHANCE ( Guessing ) : 6:41 . PACE CREAGAN She comes through at 7:10 . Sometimes 7:12 . Sometimes she 'll come on at 7:09 for ten days straight and then bang , she 's off three minutes . She 's never exact ; you ca n't trust her . That 's what I like . DALTON CHANCE How many times have you done it ? PACE CREAGAN Twice . Once with Jeff Farley . Once alone . DALTON CHANCE You 're lyin ' . Jeff Farley never ran it . PACE CREAGAN Nope . Never did . Tied his shoes on real tight , took two deep breaths , said , " I 'm ready when you are . " And then he heard that whistle . Are n't a lot of people can hear that whistle . DALTON CHANCE So you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he turned tail and ran . DALTON CHANCE So how many times then ? Just once ? PACE CREAGAN Once . And that 's once more than you . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . Who was witness ? PACE CREAGAN No one here to see me . DALTON CHANCE You 're lying . p. 5 PACE CREAGAN Whatever you say . DALTON CHANCE Did you run it or not ? PACE CREAGAN Sure . Once . DALTON CHANCE How come I do n't believe you ? PACE CREAGAN Me and you , we 'll have witnesses . Philip , Lester and Laura Sutton will be here at 7:05 . DALTON CHANCE No . No way . You said just you and me as witness . PACE CREAGAN If you get scared and run , who 's to say you wo n't lie and say I chickened too ? DALTON CHANCE You said just you and me . PACE CREAGAN It 'll be just you and me . Up there . Down here in the creek bed we 'll have the three stooges watching us . Keeping tabs . Taking notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're done and see who 's shit . DALTON CHANCE You know . You do n't talk like a girl . Should . PACE CREAGAN ( Meaning it ) : Thanks . DALTON CHANCE But you look like one . So I guess you are . PACE CREAGAN Want me to prove it ? DALTON CHANCE No. p. 6 PACE CREAGAN How old are you ? DALTON CHANCE Sixteen . In a couple of months . PACE CREAGAN ( Nears him ) : Well , well . Almost a man . ( Pushes him backward , but not too hard ) Listen to me , Dalton Chance , two years my junior , and shut up . Here 's what we 're going to do . DALTON CHANCE Just spell it out for me . Once and clear . PACE CREAGAN Okay . She 's pulling eight cars at seventy tons a piece at eighty-five . Not a big one , as far as they go . But big enough . The engine herself 's one hundred and fifty-three tons . And not cotton , kid . Just cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just imagine it . DALTON CHANCE How do you know what the train weighs ? PACE CREAGAN I looked her up . The year , the weight , the speed . DALTON CHANCE So you can read . PACE CREAGAN ( Ignoring his comment ) : Yeah , well . You and her are coming from opposite sides , right . You 've got to time it exact cause you need to make it across before she hits the trestle . It 's like playin chicken with a car , only she 's bigger and you 're not a car . The kick is once you get halfway across , do n't turn back and try to outrun her . You lose time like that . Just face her and go . p. 7 DALTON CHANCE So what if you know it 's too close ? You go for the side , right ? PACE CREAGAN There 's no side . DALTON CHANCE Yes there is . PACE CREAGAN There 's no side . Look at it . DALTON CHANCE There 's a side . PACE CREAGAN What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . There are no sides . DALTON CHANCE So what do you do if you ca n't make it across before she starts over ? PACE CREAGAN You make the cross . That 's all there is to it . DALTON CHANCE But what if you ca n't ? PACE CREAGAN Remember Brett Weaver ? DALTON CHANCE That 's different . He was drunk . PACE CREAGAN He was not . DALTON CHANCE Yes he was . He was drunk . PACE CREAGAN Say that again and I 'll punch you . DALTON CHANCE The papers said he was drunk . PACE CREAGAN Brett was n't drunk . He was just slow . DALTON CHANCE Slow ? He was on the track team . p. 8 PACE CREAGAN That night he was slow . DALTON CHANCE How do you know ? PACE CREAGAN I just know . DALTON CHANCE Well . I 've had a look like I told you I would and I 've decided : I 'm not crossing . PACE CREAGAN I knew it . I knew it . DALTON CHANCE Only a drunk or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CREAGAN You got the heart of a rabbit . A dead rabbit . And now you owe me a buck . DALTON CHANCE No way . I never said for certain . I said maybe . And you said it was safe . You did n't say anything about there being no safety sides . You said it was a piece of cake . PACE CREAGAN It is a piece of cake . If you time it right . DALTON CHANCE Forget it . PACE CREAGAN You 're breaking the deal . Pay me a buck right now or else . DALTON CHANCE I said no . PACE CREAGAN ( Calmly pulls a switchblade ) : Then I 'll hurt you . DALTON CHANCE Put that away . You 're warped . That 's what everyone says at school : Pace Creagan is warped . p. 9 PACE CREAGAN Then why 'd you come up here with me ? I 'm not even your friend . DALTON CHANCE No . You 're not my friend . My friends do n't pull knives . PACE CREAGAN You were starting to like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd run it with me . DALTON CHANCE I said I might . I thought it could be fun . Warped people can be fun sometimes . PACE CREAGAN If you back down everyone will know . DALTON CHANCE I do n't care . I do n't have a fan club . PACE CREAGAN Mary Ellen Berry is coming as witness too . DALTON CHANCE No she 's not . PACE CREAGAN I asked her to . And she knows you 've got a fancy for her . DALTON CHANCE Big deal . I asked her out . She turned me down . End of story . PACE CREAGAN She says you 're too short . DALTON CHANCE I 'm not short . PACE CREAGAN I do n't think she was talking height . DALTON CHANCE I 'm leaving . PACE CREAGAN Hey . I told her to give you a chance . She likes me . She listens to me . I told her you were going to cross the trestle with me . She said , " Oh . " You know , like she was thinking things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The way girls think things . One , two , three , about face . Change of season . Oh . She said , " Oh , " like she was about to change her mind . DALTON CHANCE Mary Ellen 's popular . Why would she listen to you ? PACE CREAGAN ( Shrugs ) : I once told her to take off her clothes and she did . DALTON CHANCE And what does that mean ? PACE CREAGAN It means I can run faster than she can so she does what I tell her to do . And she 'll be here tonight . She 's coming to watch us cross . DALTON CHANCE You had a look at her ? Naked ? What 's she like ? PACE CREAGAN I 'd say she 's on the menu . Front , back , and in reverse . You 'd like her . DALTON CHANCE How would you know what I like ? You 're not good looking . PACE CREAGAN Yeah . But that 's got nothing to do with trains . DALTON CHANCE So how close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say I had ' bout eight seconds leeway . DALTON CHANCE Eight seconds . Sure . p. 11 PACE CREAGAN A kid could do it . Look . We wo n't do it tonight , okay . We 'll work up to it . Tonight we 'll just watch her pass . Take her measure . Check her steam . Make sure we got it down . Then when we 're ready , we 'll run her . It 'll be a snap . DALTON CHANCE A snap . What if you trip ? PACE CREAGAN Brett tripped . DALTON CHANCE He was messed up . Even if he was n't drunk . He used to hit himself in the face just for the fun of it . Brett was mental . He 'd hit his own nose until it bled . PACE CREAGAN Brett was n't mental . DALTON CHANCE I saw Brett hit himself . I saw him do it . PACE CREAGAN It 's none of your business . DALTON CHANCE You were his girl . PACE CREAGAN We were friends . I never kissed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these days . DALTON CHANCE How come ? PACE CREAGAN ' Cause if you do n't your life will turn out just like you think it will : quick , dirty and cold . DALTON CHANCE Hey . I might go to college when I graduate . PACE CREAGAN You 're not going to college . None of us are going to college . p. 12 DALTON CHANCE I got the grades for it . That 's what Mr. Pearson says . PACE CREAGAN And who 's gon na pay for it ? Look at your shoes . DALTON CHANCE Huh ? PACE CREAGAN Your shoes . If your mom 's putting you in shoes like that then you are n't going to college . ( Beat ) Come on . Let 's go up and watch . DALTON CHANCE If I ca n't go to college , I 'll just leave . PACE CREAGAN Some things should stay in one place , Dalton Chance . You 're probably one of them . p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO The present . Dalton in an empty cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheveled . He just stares . And stares . At nothing . After some moments Chas , the jailer , enters . He seems friendly enough . Dalton does n't acknowledge Chas 's presence . Chas slips from one subject to the next , with hardly a pause . CHAS WEAVER On break . Thought I 'd sit it out with you . The other guy , across the hall . He 's looking for grass in his cell . Thinks he 's a moose . Could be some other herbivore but every now and then he lets out this call and it sounds close enough to a moose . Yesterday , a bug . Some kind of a beetle , I think , with huge claws . He used his arms like pincers . Opening and closing them . Opening and closing . For hours . Wayne was leaning in to give him some grub and the next minute he caught Wayne around the neck . Almost choked him to death . While I was prying him off he 's making this sound . A beetle sound , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Self respect : gone . Was the manager of the Plate Glass Company . A real Roosevelt man . Good to his men , though he laid them off . Then his head went pop one day and he started breaking up the plant . Glass everywhere . Wrecked half the place . Even the WPA says close it down . No one needs glass these days . Might want glass but they do n't need it . Mr. Roosevelt , I say , want to buy some glass ? Them up high 's got the money to want . They do n't have to go by need . What kind of a beetle was it , you think ? Big pincers . Opening and closing.How 'd the visit go ? I know your folks . Nice people . Sorry to hear your daddy 's still out of work . But who is n't ? Well , I 'm not . I 'm still here . Could be somewheres else , like Spain shooting some whatyou-callem , but I might get killed and then bein ' here looks better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known my Brett at school . Big fellow . Fast runner ? Moose 's easier to identify . Distinctive . My break 's about up . So what do you think , kid ? How many years do you think you 'll get ? Or will they hang you ? When they hang you the last thing you hear is your own neck break . And if you got a thick neck bone , a strong one , a young one , then it takes a while to break clean through , sometimes hours , and all the while you 're dying you 're hearing it snappin ' and cracklin ' and poppin ' , just like a stick on the fire . So what do you think ? ( Chas gets no response so he shrugs and leaves the cell. ) p. 14 DALTON CHANCE A stag beetle . That 's what kind it was . p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE The past . Same as Scene One . Dalton is trying to get the shoes off his mother 's feet after she 's come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read it at the drugstore . GIN CHANCE Just leave it . DALTON CHANCE All your nerves 're squashed up in the ball of your foot . Stop wiggling . ( Dalton gets one of her shoes off . She relaxes now as he massages her feet . ) GIN CHANCE How 's the math going at school ? DALTON CHANCE ( Teasing ) : You 've got seven toes . GIN CHANCE Woman on the right of me , Barbara Hill , laid off Tuesday . Woman on my left , laid off today . Just waiting my turn . DALTON CHANCE You 've been there forever . They need you . GIN CHANCE How is he ? DALTON CHANCE Quiet . GIN CHANCE Yeah , quiet . ( Gin unwraps a small stack of plates . Looks at them . Then wraps them up again as she speaks . ) It 's getting harder to find the plates . Even the Salvation is running short . I do n't want to use the blue ones my mother gave me . Might have to one of these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton is finished with her feet . He begins to unpin her hair and then brush it . She lets him . ) GIN CHANCE You got anything better to do with your afternoons than take care of an old mother when she comes home from work ? You should be out with the boys . Yelling . Falling down . Doing fun things boys do . What do boys do for fun ? DALTON CHANCE You know the trestle up at Pope Lick ? Well , I was with a girl there this afternoon , after school . GIN CHANCE Hmmm . DALTON CHANCE Name 's Pace Creagan . We watched the train come through . GIN CHANCE Boy got killed up there a couple of years ago . DALTON CHANCE It 's not a big train but it 's big up close . And loud . GIN CHANCE You kiss her ? DALTON CHANCE No way . She 's not the kissing kind . Not pretty either . GIN CHANCE ( Matter-of-factly ) : Not that handsome yourself , Dalton . DALTON CHANCE That 's what she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . p. 17 DALTON CHANCE Even if I wanted to , and I 'm not saying I do , I never really  --  you know , like how people do  --  kissed a girl . GIN CHANCE Not much to it . Just open your mouth and start chewing . First time I kissed your father it was all wet and disgusting . By the second time I 'd started to like him , and then it was like breathing water for air , that smooth . DALTON CHANCE I do n't know . GIN CHANCE Neither did I. ( Dray appears . He sits in a corner with a stool . No one speaks for some moments . Dray just sits with his back to them . As they speak , Dalton walks over and lights Dray 's candle , casually ; he does this all the time for his father . ) DALTON CHANCE I need some new shoes . GIN CHANCE I know that . DALTON CHANCE I 'll get a job . GIN CHANCE You 've got school . ( Dray makes a hand shadow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DALTON CHANCE You know , the train that comes through Pope Lick , the engine weighs one hundred and fifty-three tons . That 's what Pace says . ( Dray makes another hand shadow . Dalton watches his father . He moves to put his hand on his father 's shoulder but his father looks at him , like a warning , so Dalton withdraws his hand. ) p. 18 GIN CHANCE Trains . Yeah . Huge , sweatin ' , steamin ' , oil spittin ' promises when I was a girl . Always taking someone away , never bringing someone back . I could n't get used to it . DALTON CHANCE I 'm going out . ( Kisses his mother on the cheek , then moves away ) When you were fifteen . Like me , Mother . What did you want ? ( Dray makes another hand shadow . ) GIN CHANCE Someone to look me straight in the face and tell me flat out that I was n't going anywhere . DALTON CHANCE Yeah ? Well then say it to me . Go on . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton . DALTON CHANCE Say : " Dalton , my boy . You 're not going anywhere . " ( Gin is silent , then : ) GIN CHANCE You 're my child . DALTON CHANCE ( Quietly ) : That does n't make any difference . ( Dalton exits . Dray stops making hand shadows . He is still . ) GIN CHANCE ( She just looks at Dray 's back ) : Touch me . ( Dray is still . He turns to look at her , then slowly looks away. ) p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Pace and Dalton at the trestle , a few days later . PACE CREAGAN We need to watch her for days and days . Studyin ' . Studyin ' . And then one night we 'll run her . DALTON CHANCE Sure . One night . PACE CREAGAN There 's a simple reason we 're biding our time . Waiting for the moment that counts : we do n't want to die . Now repeat after me : we do n't want to die . DALTON CHANCE We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be patient . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . Until Christmas . I 'll be getting some new shoes . And then I 'll hook a job . Move up . PACE CREAGAN That 's against the laws of gravity . Besides , you ca n't move up when you 've got no teeth . DALTON CHANCE I 've got teeth . PACE CREAGAN You wo n't in a few years . DALTON CHANCE You 've got no determination . No plan for the future . PACE CREAGAN Yeah , but I watch . DALTON CHANCE Watch what ? PACE CREAGAN Things . People . I 've been watching . And this is how things are . ( Casually ) You and me and the rest of us kids out here , we 're just like . Okay . Like potatoes left in a box . You ever seen a potato that 's been left in a box ? The potato thinks the dark is the dirt and it starts to grow roots so it can survive , but the dark is n't the dirt and all it ends up sucking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 20 DALTON CHANCE I 'm not a potato . PACE CREAGAN Yes you are . DALTON CHANCE No I 'm not . Potatoes ca n't run . I can . And when we decide to do it , I 'm gon na make it over that trestle before you 're halfway across . Until then , I 'm going home . PACE CREAGAN What time is it ? DALTON CHANCE 6:51 . PACE CREAGAN Tell you what . We 'll have a practice first . DALTON CHANCE What kind of practice ? PACE CREAGAN A real kind . Almost . Just to warm up . Pop the bones . Roll the blood over . You know . ( Pace opens the paper bag she has with her . In it are a pair of boy 's pants . She starts to take off her dress , not caring a bit that Dalton is there . ) DALTON CHANCE Jesus . PACE CREAGAN Would you practice running the trestle in a dress ? ( Dalton turns around . ) You can look if you want . DALTON CHANCE No thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . ) PACE CREAGAN ( Casually ) : Why not ? p. 21 DALTON CHANCE You 're loud . Your hands are dirty . You stare . ( Beat ) And you 're not pretty , really . PACE CREAGAN You said that before . DALTON CHANCE Well , it keeps coming back to me . PACE CREAGAN Anything else , kid ? DALTON CHANCE There 'll be more once I get to know you . PACE CREAGAN I 'm ready . ( Dalton turns around . Pace is dressed in pants and a shirt , perhaps her brother 's . She throws the dress at Dalton . ) Smell it . DALTON CHANCE No way . PACE CREAGAN Baby . ( Dalton smells the dress . ) Well ? DALTON CHANCE It smells nice . Flowery . Like a girl . PACE CREAGAN ( Cuffs him as she snatches the dress back ) : Want to know what I do n't like about you , Dalton Chance ? You 're a good boy . A very good boy . DALTON CHANCE So what 's that mean ? PACE CREAGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got to break you in half . ( Sighs ) I guess it 'll have to be me. p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE The present . Dalton and Chas in his cell . Dalton is turned away from Chas . CHAS WEAVER Now him over there , he does n't know who his mother is . A turtle does n't consider those things . Want to know how I know he 's a turtle ? ( Demonstrates , impressively , a turtle , moving its neck in and out of its shell ) I know what you 're thinking : could be a goose . I thought of that . But a goose does n't do this  --  ( Moves his head slowly from side to side , then cocks his head to one side , opens his mouth and eats ) A goose does n't eat like a turtle . How you feelin ' , boy ? What 're you thinking ? Still wo n't talk . Still wo n't talk . But they got it on record when they brought you in : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said . Why did n't you lie ? They do n't have a witness . Four words . Just four words : " Yeah , I killed her . " But wo n't say why . Wo n't say how . What kind of a game are you playing ? Well , they 'll find it out . They know about kids . I had a boy your age . Couple of years older than you . Not much to him . But he was my son . ( Beat ) To think . He was just a kid like you . Scared of nothing . Yeah . Scared of nothing ' cause you are nothing . Half of you kids wanting to kill , the rest wanting to die . Ordering death like it 's a nice , cold drink and you 're going to suck it down in one gulp and then get up and walk away from it . Right . Kids . Just want to eat , fuck and tear the ornaments off the tree . But only if you do n't have to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole damn country 's going to hell ' cause of your kind . ( Beat ) You should have killed your own self instead . That 's what they say . ( Beat ) I loved my boy Brett . But I never could figure what he was . Something kinda small . Like a wheel , maybe . Something that spins in place in the dark . He had a gap in his heart . He was empty . I know ; I was his father . Sometimes he 'd ask me to embrace him . ( Shrugs ) He was my son . ( Beat ) So he 'd be here , in my arms , sniffling like a baby . But there was nothing . I was holding him . He was in my arms . But it was like holding onto . Nothing . ( Beat ) What 's it feel like to be like that ? Huh ? What 's it feel like to be that empty ? ( Begins to take off his shirt ) I 'm going to have to hate you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands over Dalton . Dalton is shivering and does not respond . Chas puts his shirt around Dalton . ) I 'll bring you some dinner . You 've lost weight . Hard not to do in here . p. 23 p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX The past . Pace , Dalton and Gin are sitting together . There is a strained feeling . Dalton wants things to be nice . GIN CHANCE Dalton made a clock for his science project . Did n't you , Dalton ? DALTON CHANCE That was last year . This year I made a scale . To measure things on . GIN CHANCE A scale . That 's right . I use it in the kitchen . To measure flour . It works really well . You want to try it , Pace ? PACE CREAGAN I do n't do much with flour . GIN CHANCE Oh . But I 'm sure you help your mother in the kitchen . ( Dalton speaks before Pace can answer . ) DALTON CHANCE Pace likes to sew . Do n't you ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own clothes . Tell her you make your own clothes , Pace . PACE CREAGAN I make my own clothes . My mother 's not what she used to be . GIN CHANCE That 's nice . I mean , about your clothes . What did your mother used to be ? PACE CREAGAN Hopeful . ( Beat ) Thank you for the tea , Mrs. Chance . It was very sweet . p. 25 GIN CHANCE That 's how we like it here . In our home . ( They all sit in an awkward silence . After some moments , Pace places the large bag she 's brought on the table . ) DALTON CHANCE Pace said she brought something for you , Mother . GIN CHANCE My , that 's nice . You did n't need to , really . PACE CREAGAN I made it in science class . Like Dalton did . ( Pace unwraps the bag to reveal a strange mechanical engine . It looks impressive . ) GIN CHANCE Oh . That 's . Nice . What is it ? PACE CREAGAN It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam engine was the first practical working steam engine . It 's simple : fire here at the bottom heats the water , the steam forces up the piston and it 's cooled , fast , by spraying cold water on the cylinder . This turns the steam back to water and makes a vacuum in the space under the piston . GIN CHANCE Piston . DALTON CHANCE It 's a present , Mother . PACE CREAGAN You see , the pressure of air outside the cylinder then pushes the piston back down again . And so on . The crosspiece joining the engine to the pump gives it its name : " beam " engine . p. 26 GIN CHANCE This is a train you 've got here ? PACE CREAGAN An engine . But it 's an older model . GIN CHANCE Looks kind of small to me . PACE CREAGAN The original was bigger than both of us . GIN CHANCE Well , start it up then . PACE CREAGAN Does n't work . Did once . Second time , my father he was leaning over it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third time : bang . Not a big one but I got a piece of glass in my arm . GIN CHANCE Sounds unpredictable . PACE CREAGAN It 's the only thing I had of my own to give you . ( Beat ) I did n't get a good grade on it . GIN CHANCE You 're two years older than Dalton . DALTON CHANCE Mother . PACE CREAGAN Almost . GIN CHANCE He 's been seeing a lot of you these past weeks . DALTON CHANCE Can we have some more tea ? PACE CREAGAN You ever hear of Cugnot , Mrs. Chance ? Nicholas Cugnot . Made the first steam machine that moved . Crawled two miles per hour before it blew up . That was in France . 1769 , I think . The government put Cugnot in prison . Explosion did n't hurt anyone . Never understood why they put him in jail . p. 27 GIN CHANCE My son does n't know a thing about trains . PACE CREAGAN I think they were afraid . Not of the machine , but of Cugnot . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just plain old water ( Makes the sound of steam ) into steam . It must have shaken them up somehow . Just to see it . They could n't forgive him . GIN CHANCE What do you want with Dalton ? DALTON CHANCE Christ . We 're just having tea . GIN CHANCE Hush up . ( Dalton shuts up . ) We 're a family here , Pace . A regular family . My husband , Dalton and me . Lots of trouble out there , lots of bad weather . But we take care of each other ; nothing out there we need . I want you to know that . PACE CREAGAN You know the Union Pacific ? They 're gon na build the biggest steam locomotives in the world . The engine and tender 'll weigh over five hundred tons . Colossal . They 'll be 4-8-8-4 articulated locomotives with two sets of driving wheels , each with their own cylinders . ( Gin just stares at her . ) I 'm sorry . Mrs. Chance . But me and Dalton . It 's none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels . Articulated locomotives . If you 're thinking to trick my son  --  p. 28 DALTON CHANCE I ca n't believe this PACE CREAGAN Mrs. Chance , I 'm not sweet on your son 's locomotive system , if that 's what you mean . We 've never touched each other . I 've got nothing to be ashamed of . Though I did tell him to take off his clothes once , under the trestle . GIN CHANCE To take off his  --  DALTON CHANCE Pace ! PACE CREAGAN Shut up , Dalton . ( Beat ) And then once on the tracks . A hundred feet up . Was n't a train in sight . It was kinda chilly that evening , but it was safe . GIN CHANCE I think you better leave now . PACE CREAGAN He does n't like me , really . He says I 'm loud . GIN CHANCE ( To Dalton ) : You took off your clothes ? PACE CREAGAN He 's your son . He does what he 's told . GIN CHANCE Why would you do such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did . And he 's not like an engine at all . Nah . Dalton 's pale . Real pale . No steam . How 's he keep warm ? Does n't know the first thing about cylinders . And he 's so light , what keeps him where he stands ? On the tracks , slip , slip , slip . No traction . Now , the Big Boys , the new ones , they 'll need near ten tons of coal per hour in their firebox . And the grate where the coal 'll be burned is bigger than a kitchen . ( Gin just stares at her . ) Imagine it . That 's what we 're coming to . p. 29 p. 30 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN Dalton and Pace at the trestle , a few days before . PACE CREAGAN Let 's start here . On this tie . DALTON CHANCE What tie ? The track 's up there . PACE CREAGAN Imagine it , stupid . DALTON CHANCE Right . PACE CREAGAN See , this tie 's marked with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this other tie . PACE CREAGAN Look . It 's tradition , okay . Besides , Brett made this X so let 's use it . Now , you crouch down like this . Go on . Yeah . That 's right . Like at a track meet . Point your skinny rear to the stars . Got it . DALTON CHANCE I 'll count down . PACE CREAGAN Now when you say : " Go " we run like crazy to the other side . But do n't check your feet . You 'll trip if you check your feet . Just trust that your feet know where to go . DALTON CHANCE I hear you . PACE CREAGAN You 're playin ' chicken with the train , so you keep your eyes on the engine headed towards you . It 'll look like she 's real close but she wo n't be . If you start when I tell you to , you 'll have enough time to make it across and have dinner before she starts over the trestle . Ready ? p. 31 DALTON CHANCE Pace ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PACE CREAGAN This is practice , Dalton . There 's no train down here . DALTON CHANCE My legs are n't so sure . PACE CREAGAN On the count of three . Come on . DALTON AND PACE One , two , three  --  DALTON CHANCE Wait ! ( Looking over the " edge " ) PACE CREAGAN Do n't look . You 'll lose your nerve . DALTON CHANCE It 's a long way down . PACE CREAGAN Why do n't we just walk it . Give me your hand . ( Takes his hand and begins to walk him ) DALTON CHANCE God we 're high up . PACE CREAGAN ( Smacks him ) : Keep your eyes on the other side . Pretend that we 're running . ( They run in place . ) DALTON CHANCE We are . I 'm out of breath . PACE CREAGAN We 're almost there . Yeah . Yeah . Grease those knees . And now you trip . p. 32 DALTON CHANCE What ? PACE CREAGAN You trip . ( Pace trips him so he falls to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped me . Hey  --  PACE CREAGAN It might happen . DALTON CHANCE Why 'd you  --  ( Dalton tries to get up . She knocks him back down . ) PACE CREAGAN You might trip . Anything 's possible . We got to be ready for it . DALTON CHANCE But I wouldn't 've tripped ! You pushed me ! PACE CREAGAN Do n't get up . Just sit there . Like you tripped . Let 's say I 'm flaggin ' behind and you look over your shoulder to see how I 'm doing and you trip . And just as you trip you hear her coming around the hill . ( Makes the sound of a train whistle ) DALTON CHANCE You sound like a kitten . It 's like this . ( Makes an even better and more frightening whistle ) PACE CREAGAN Yeah ! And you can hear her cold slathering black hell of a heart barreling towards the trestle and it sounds like this : ( Together they make an engine sound , surprisingly well . ) But you 've twisted your ankle . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It feels like my foot 's coming off . ( Makes a painful gasp ) I try to run but I can only hobble . And the train , she 's just about to cross . PACE CREAGAN And then there I am . At your side . DALTON CHANCE No . I 'd slow you down and you know it . You just pass me by . ( Makes the sound of an arrow flying ) Like an arrow . You 've got to save your own skin . PACE CREAGAN Yeah , but I ca n't just leave you there . DALTON CHANCE Yes you can . PACE CREAGAN You 'll be killed . DALTON CHANCE I 'll be torn apart . PACE CREAGAN So I put my arm around your waist and start to drag you down the tracks with me . It 's hard going . We 've only got fifty feet or so ' til we 're clear . DALTON CHANCE But the train . ( Lets out the terrible scream of a whistle ) So you drop me . PACE CREAGAN No . DALTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life . PACE CREAGAN No . I do n't leave you . I  --  p. 34 DALTON CHANCE You make it across . Just in time . Alone . PACE CREAGAN I drag you with me . DALTON CHANCE And as you clear the tracks , you feel the hurtling wind of her as she rushes by you , so close it 's like she 's kissing the back of your neck , so close she pulls the shirt right up off you without popping the buttons . ( Beat ) And then ? And then you hear me scream . ( Dalton lets out a terrible scream . At the same time Pace screams : ) PACE CREAGAN I save you ! ( They are silent some moments . ) DALTON CHANCE And then ? And then nothing . The train , she disappears over the trestle and on down the track . ( Beat ) You , Pace Creagan , are standing there , breathing hard  --  PACE CREAGAN  --  My heart jumping jacks , yeah , shooting dice in my chest . Snake eyes . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , you know I 'm dead . You 're certain . But still you have to go back and have a look . To see what 's left . Of course there 's almost nothing left . PACE CREAGAN Yeah there was . There was a lot left . p. 35 DALTON CHANCE No . Just some bits of . Meat . And a running shoe . That 's all . I 'm mashed potatoes now . Just add some milk and stir . PACE CREAGAN He was n't wearing running shoes . DALTON CHANCE Hey . Take a look at my face . I 'm talking to you : I 'm dead . PACE CREAGAN Brett was wearing boots . DALTON CHANCE And now maybe my mom will be able to scrounge up some new shoes for the funeral . If she can find my feet . PACE CREAGAN ( Calmly ) : Shut up . Just . Shut up . Have you ever put a shell up to your ear ? DALTON CHANCE What ? PACE CREAGAN A conch shell . One of those big ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the blood in your head . ( Makes the sound of a shell over an ear ) That 's the sound . And it 's been going on for years . It 's this town . Our future . You and me . ( Makes the sound again ) Empty . No more , no less . Just . Empty . DALTON CHANCE ( Disgusted ) : I 'm going home . PACE CREAGAN Wait . DALTON CHANCE ( Leaving ) : Not this time . p. 36 PACE CREAGAN Take off your clothes . DALTON CHANCE Why ? PACE CREAGAN Because you want to . ( Dalton begins to undress . Pace watches him . He 's about to take off his underwear . ) Stop . There . Yeah . That 's enough . ( They both watch each other . Pace moves closer to him , but not too close . ) Are you cold ? DALTON CHANCE A little . ( Beat ) Well . Are you gon na touch me or what ? PACE CREAGAN No . I just wanted . To look at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something is supposed to happen . PACE CREAGAN It already has . ( Beat ) Get dressed . ( After a moment , Dalton starts to get dressed. ) p. 37 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT Gin and Dray . He sits immobile . She uncovers a small stack of plates . She tosses one to him . Suddenly he comes alive and they are tossing a plate back and forth between them as they speak . They 've done this before . The plate tossing will occur less as the scene proceeds . GIN CHANCE You 've got to get out . DRAY CHANCE I 'm movin ' . You just ca n't see it . GIN CHANCE At the WPA office . They 're helpin ' people find jobs . DRAY CHANCE A handful . GIN CHANCE That 's better than nothing DRAY CHANCE I do n't know . GIN CHANCE I went by the Council . They got kicked out of the church basement . Got a room in the Watson store-house . More like a closet than a room . DRAY CHANCE The Council . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not . Just people out of work . Tryin ' to get things going . Lots of talk about the Plate Glass factory . DRAY CHANCE It 's closed down . GIN CHANCE Talk about opening it up again . Building it back up . Running it themselves . Machinery 's still there . Most of it . It 's a mess but it 's all still there . p. 38 DRAY CHANCE We 've got what we need . The three of us . Under this roof . GIN CHANCE I know that . DRAY CHANCE Sounds like you 're getting involved . GIN CHANCE No . I 'm not . I 'm just listening . DRAY CHANCE My father worked there when he was a boy . There 'd be explosions now and then . He wore eye wear . A lot of them did n't . Once the glass hit him in the mouth . Long thin pieces of glass . He pulled them out his cheeks with pliers , like pullin ' fish bones out a fish . ( Beat ) That place does n't belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHANCE People , Dray . Just people tired of not working . Tired of waiting for the WPA to hand out the jobs . Tired . Just tired . You know that kind of tired . DRAY CHANCE Ca n't remember when I was n't . GIN CHANCE I remember . When you were a boy . ( Dray almost drops a plate , but catches it . He becomes more playful . ) DRAY CHANCE You lie , Miss Ginny Carol . I was never a kid . GIN CHANCE Yeah you were . And so was I. DRAY CHANCE Nah . That was just a fancy idea we had about ourselves . p. 39 GIN CHANCE You did n't bring me flowers like other girls got . You brought me tomatoes . DRAY CHANCE You ca n't eat flowers . GIN CHANCE And corn . You were nineteen . DRAY CHANCE A bucket of frogs , too . I made you close your eyes and put your hands in it . You did n't scream like most of them did . You went dead pale . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damnedest thing : you kissed me . Not on the cheek , either . Smack on the mouth . GIN CHANCE I was in shock . The frogs did it to me . ( Beat ) You hardly kissed me back . DRAY CHANCE I was in shock . Never had a girl put her tongue in my mouth before . We were n't even engaged . You took me to the storm shelter and took off your dress . You pushed me to my knees . I never kissed a girl there before . I never even thought it could be done . You went dead pale . That was the second time I thought I killed you . When you finally let me get to my feet , you had a clump of my hair in each of your hands , you 'd pulled on my head so hard . GIN CHANCE I was n't tired back then . And neither were you . DRAY CHANCE No , I guess I was n't . ( Beat ) There were two things I wanted when I was a boy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other was to have you turn me into a bald man by the time I was old . p. 40 GIN CHANCE You lost quite a bit of hair over the years . Though not lately , I 'm sorry to say . ( Dray misses a plate and it drops and breaks . Silence . ) DRAY CHANCE It was mine , Gin . Nineteen years of it . GIN CHANCE Yeah , and what did it give you ? A bad arm , a broken collar , burns across your back so deep the bath water stays in them . DRAY CHANCE That job was mine . GIN CHANCE We 're still here . DRAY CHANCE Yeah . And you wo n't ever leave me . GIN CHANCE I wo n't ever leave you , Dray . ( Silence some moments . ) I heard at work they were hiring a couple of men down at Turner 's . You might  --  DRAY CHANCE ( Interrupts ) : I was there this morning while you were at work . They hired three men . Three men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound . For the longest time we just stood there watching the door that 'd been shut . All that disappointment . Fifty-two men . Fifty-two of us . And weighin ' how much ? None of us eating big these days . Most of us lookin ' lean . Maybe eight thousand pounds , all of us together . That much disappointment . ( Beat ) And not a sound . ( Gin moves to touch Dray , to comfort him . Dray speaks gently to her . ) Do n't touch me , Gin . I could kill you . p. 41 Act 1 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE The cell . Dalton lying asleep on the floor in a blanket . He gets up . He thinks he 's alone . But Gin is standing over him ; he starts . GIN CHANCE Dalton . DALTON CHANCE You 're always alone . GIN CHANCE He hardly leaves the house . DALTON CHANCE You 'd think this might be special circumstances . GIN CHANCE He 's restless . Without you home . DALTON CHANCE He never looked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to look at someone  --  DALTON CHANCE I do n't need your excuses . Neither does he . From what I remember , he did n't look at you any more than he did at me . GIN CHANCE Not long ago he used to hold me . DALTON CHANCE Big deal . Holding someone 's a cinch . It does n't cost . It 's easy . GIN CHANCE And the girl . What about her , then . To hold her . ( Pace appears . While neither Gin nor Dalton sees her , sometimes they sense , at different moments , that she is " there . " Pace is playful . ) Was that " easy " ? p. 42 DALTON CHANCE That 's none of your business . ( Beat ) I do n't want you here . PACE CREAGAN Was that " a cinch " ? DALTON CHANCE ( Shouts ) : I did n't hold her ! ( Now he is quiet ) She held me . Pace did . But it was n't that . Holding . Sometimes when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in bed , I could feel her breath in my ears . No . PACE AND DALTON That 's not it . PACE CREAGAN It was n't just you and me . DALTON CHANCE It was something more . Like at school . At school they teach you . To speak . They say it 's math  --  PACE CREAGAN History  --  DALTON CHANCE Geometry , whatever . But they 're teaching you to speak . Not about the world but about things . Just things : a door , a map , PACE CREAGAN a cup . Just the name of it . DALTON CHANCE Not what a cup means , who picked it up , who drank from it , PACE CREAGAN who did n't and why ; DALTON CHANCE where a map came from , who fixed in the rivers , who 'll take the wrong turn ; or a door . Who cut the wood and hung it there ? Why that width , that height ? And who made that decision ? Who agreed to it ? Who did n't ? p. 43 PACE CREAGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHANCE They just teach us to speak the things . So that 's what we speak . But there 's no past that way . PACE AND DALTON And no future . DALTON CHANCE ' Cause after you 've said the thing , you move on . You do n't look back . You never think to stop and turn . PACE CREAGAN ( No longer playful ) : But you stopped , did n't you , Dalton ? You stopped and turned . DALTON CHANCE She laughed at everything that seemed right . PACE CREAGAN And you did n't turn back . ( Calmly ) You son of a bitch . ( Pace retreats somewhat , but she is still " there . " ) DALTON CHANCE It was n't just at night . In the day sometimes . Not her voice but the sound of her . I could hear it . Like water running in a pipe . But that 's not it . It was more like this . This cup . ( Takes his drinking cup , calmly kneels and breaks it on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Look . This was sand and heat . Not long ago . Other things , too . Pieces and bits . And now . It 's something else . Glass . Blood . And it 's broken . ( Picks up a large piece , nears Gin ) I could cut you open with it . ( Gin slaps his face . He 's taken aback , put in his place . ) But that 's what she did to me . Cut me open and things were n't just things after that . I was just a kid  --  p. 44 PACE CREAGAN  --  like any other . You did n't care . DALTON CHANCE I never even thought about it . But then one day I was n't sure . She did that to me . She made me  --  hesitate . In everything I did . I was . Unsure . Look . It 's not a cup anymore ; it 's a knife . ( Pace stands close to Dalton , but he can not see her . ) PACE CREAGAN I could cut you open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . I could touch myself at night and I did n't know if it was her hand or mine . I could touch myself . I could put my hand . I could . Maybe I was asleep . I do n't know but sometimes I put my hand . Inside myself . PACE CREAGAN ( Whispers to him ) : And you were wet . DALTON CHANCE I was wet . Just like a girl . It was . Yeah . Like I was touching her . Just to touch myself . ( Beat ) It was n't right . ( Silence some moments . ) GIN CHANCE Only time I ever knew things were right is when they were wrong . Everyone said your father was a mistake . After I made that one , and it worked out so well , I dedicated myself to making as many mistakes as possible in a lifetime . The only time I was ever sure who I was was when I was wrong . ( Beat ) I think you loved that girl . p. 45 DALTON CHANCE Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to go . GIN CHANCE All right . ( Pace suddenly kicks a piece of the broken cup . It skids between Gin and Dalton . Gin looks at the broken piece . Split scene : Dray is alone in another area . Perhaps up above them . In the dark . He is making awkward but somehow lovely movements . Then we see he is dancing without music . ) PACE CREAGAN There 's your cup , kid . Drink from it . ( Dray sings and dances his song . ) DRAY CHANCE When I was still living , when I was a boy I could sing like the water and dance like a toy . My love she would kiss me ' til my mouth it was warmed.There was no place on earth where we 'd ever be harmed . p. 46 Act 1 , Scene 10 SCENE TEN Pace and Dalton under the trestle . DALTON CHANCE There 's no one home at my house in the daytime . We could hang out there . Well , my dad 's at home , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever since he got laid off at the foundry , he sits with the lights off . He 's got a candle burning . Makes shadows on the wall with his hands . Spiders . Bats . You know . Rabbits . PACE CREAGAN I guess I 'm supposed to think that 's sad . DALTON CHANCE You think about kissing me ? PACE CREAGAN Kissing you where ? DALTON CHANCE I do n't know . Here . In your yard . Or mine . PACE CREAGAN I mean where on you ? DALTON CHANCE My mouth . Where else ? PACE CREAGAN Nope . We 're friends . DALTON CHANCE Like you and Brett were friends ? PACE CREAGAN That was different . He was like my sister or something . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . Yeah . Just forget it , okay . Pace Creagan is n't that kind of girl , anyhow . She pulls knives . She takes off her clothes . She pisses under the trestle. p. 47 PACE CREAGAN Shits there too . I mean , why go all the way home ? DALTON CHANCE But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mouth ; that 's common . DALTON CHANCE Where else then ? PACE CREAGAN I do n't know . A place where no one else has kissed you , maybe . Everyone in the world has kissed you on the face , right ? DALTON CHANCE Keep talking . PACE CREAGAN If I ever kiss you , and I 'm not saying I ever will , it will be some place even you 've never thought of . DALTON CHANCE You mean  --  ( Looks down at his crotch , with a sort of reserved bravado ) PACE CREAGAN No way . You could trick me and piss on me . Look , if you want a kiss so bad , I 'll give it to you , but you got to promise to take it wherever I want to plant it . DALTON CHANCE If it 's at least ten seconds long , I promise . PACE CREAGAN Agreed . Take down your pants . DALTON CHANCE ( Suddenly afraid ) : No . Wait . You said it was n't there ! PACE CREAGAN It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops his pants . ) Turn around . p. 48 DALTON CHANCE Pace . I 'm not sure  --  PACE CREAGAN ( Interrupts ) : Shut up , kid . We got a deal . ( Dalton reluctantly turns around . Pace stands behind him , then drops to her knees . ) Count . ( Pace puts her mouth just above the back of his knee . She kisses him there and holds it . ) DALTON CHANCE One , two , three , four , five , six seven ( Pace slaps him and he continues counting. ) eight , nine , ten . ( Pace stands up . Dalton pulls up his pants . They look at each other . Dalton is unsure of what has happened . ) Well . Yeah . PACE CREAGAN You happy now ? DALTON CHANCE Happy . Sure . ( Beat ) I 'm gon na run over to Sean 's right now and tell him all about it . How it was great . How long it lasted . How far we went . " Sean , Sean , guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that what you did with your friend Brett ? You kiss him like that too ? ( Pace approaches him , then spits on him and wipes her mouth . ) PACE CREAGAN There . You can have it back . I wish I 'd never done it . ( Dalton starts to push her . He 's pushing her hard backward but she keeps her footing . The potential for violence to escalate is evident. ) p. 49 DALTON CHANCE Spit on me ? You think you can do that ? Who the hell do you think you are ? Who the hell , Pace Creagan ? What 's so special about your kiss , huh ? I could just take it , you know . I could just take it if I wanted to . ( Pace pushes back . Pace raises her arm to hit him but then hesitates . ) Go on . I 'm your friend . Hit me . PACE CREAGAN I do n't want to hit you . I want you to shut up . You liked it . I could tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DALTON CHANCE I wanted you to kiss me on the mouth . PACE CREAGAN When you were counting . All the while . Could n't you feel it ? Where I was kissing you , it was on your mouth . ( They are quiet some moments . ) DALTON CHANCE What I said about Brett . It was stupid . PACE CREAGAN Yeah . It was . ( Beat ) But you were wrong the other day . That 's not what a train does to you . It does n't mush you up in neat little pieces . This train . She 's a knife . That 's why we loved her . Me and Brett . So much beauty she 's breathless : a huge hunk and chunk of shiny black coal blasted fresh out of the mountain . ( Beat ) We had a good start . Me and Brett . We both could have made it . ' Course Brett , he was faster . I expected to be running behind . But Brett was worried . About me . He was stupid like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he tripped . I thought he 'd just jump up and keep going so I passed him right by . We 'd timed it tight , and right then that engine was so close I could smell her . ( Beat ) I thought Brett was right behind me. p. 50 DALTON CHANCE You left him on the tracks ? PACE CREAGAN I thought he was running behind me . I could hear him behind me . He did n't call out . He did n't say wait up . I did n't know . Why did n't he call out ? ( There is the real sound of a whistle in the distance . ) Not even a sound . Brett just sat there where he 'd fallen . And then he stood up , slowly , like he had the time . He stood there looking at her , looking her straight in the face . Almost like it was a dare . Like : go ahead and hit me . You ca n't do that to a train . You ca n't dare a train to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closer this time . ) DALTON CHANCE This is stupid . Brett was alone up there . Nobody knows . PACE CREAGAN Just stood there like she could pass right through him for all he cared . Like he was n't going to flinch . DALTON CHANCE Let 's get out of here , it 's getting late . ( He takes her arm . ) PACE CREAGAN Let go of me . DALTON CHANCE You 're making this up . PACE CREAGAN Get off . DALTON CHANCE You 're out of your mind . ( Dalton tries to grab her again . She resists and he stumbles . There is the tremendous sound of a train rushing over the trestle above them . Then it disappears into the distance . Dalton 's cut his hand . ) Shit . p. 51 PACE CREAGAN You all right ? DALTON CHANCE No . Cut my hand . PACE CREAGAN Let me see . DALTON CHANCE Just a scratch . PACE CREAGAN It 's not how you think it is . The train , she does n't mush you up . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . She 's cleaner than that . I walked back down the tracks after the train had passed . She cut Brett in two . DALTON CHANCE Pace . PACE CREAGAN You know what I thought ? Blocks . Two blocks , and maybe if I could fit the pieces back together again , he 'd be . Whole . DALTON CHANCE Will you shut your mouth . Please . ( Pace rips a long strip of cloth from her dress . ) PACE CREAGAN Use this . Wrap it around your hand . It 'll stop the bleeding . ( She bandages his hand ) DALTON CHANCE Thanks . ( Beat ) You going home now ? PACE CREAGAN I do n't know . My mom made a loaf for my brother 's birthday tomorrow . Maybe we could weasel some out of her tonight . DALTON CHANCE Okay . p. 52 PACE CREAGAN We 're going to do it for real . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . We 'll do it . We 'll make the cross . PACE CREAGAN Both of us . Side by side . DALTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DALTON CHANCE As can be . PACE CREAGAN Does your dad really make shadow animals on the wall ? DALTON CHANCE Yep . PACE CREAGAN Can you ? DALTON CHANCE Never tried . PACE CREAGAN That 's pretty neat . Not everyone can do that . I ca n't . ( She stands close to him , face to face for a moment . ) You wo n't take anything from me that I do n't want to give you , Dalton . And that 's a fact . DALTON CHANCE All right . ( Beat ) Hey , I 'll race you down the hill . PACE CREAGAN Nah . I 'm tired . ( Beat ) Go ! ( Blackout . We hear Dalton 's voice in the dark , but as though it were coming from a distance away . ) DALTON CHANCE Hey , you  --  I 'll catch you this time ! p. 53 Act 1 , Scene 11 SCENE ELEVEN In the semi-dark we see the hands of someone . Two blue hands . They move about in the dark . They " play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Gin becomes visible . Suddenly , Pace appears , perhaps somewhere above or behind Gin . Pace is in the same dress we saw her wear in her earlier scenes with Dalton . The tear in the dress is larger . This is the only difference in her appearance . Though Pace is not in front of Gin , Gin speaks to her and looks at her as though Pace were right in front of her . GIN CHANCE Oh . Pace . ( Pace is still . She just watches Gin . ) I did n't see you . I was just . Trying to get used to this . It wo n't come off . They 're lights , almost . It does n't hurt . Well , it hurts ' cause I scrub them but it does no good . This color 's here to stay . One morning I go to work and I come home with blue hands . They changed chemicals again at the plant . All sixteen of us in my section got blue hands . Some of the women , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to see it as a wonder , too . During break , we turned off the lights and standing all together , some with our arms raised , others at our side , we looked like a Christmas tree in the dark , with blue lights . Then we all put our arms over our heads like this ( Demonstrates ) and waved our fingers and we were a flock of crazy bluebirds taking off . We started laughing then , and piling on top of each other , imagine it , and most of us women my age , and our hands were like blue snowballs flying this way and that . One of the girls , Victoria , she laughed so hard she peed right where she stood . Another one , Willa , she slipped in it and that had all of us roaring . ( Beat ) Then Laura Townsend said we had all better think again ' cause we had the hands of dead women . Well , that put an end to the fun and we went back to work . The manager said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even used bleach . We 'll have to get used to it . Kind of ugly and kind of pretty both , is n't it ? But hands are n't meant to be blue . ( Beat ) You 're almost a woman yourself , Pace . Hell , I do n't blame him . My husband . We 're not . Close . Do you know what I mean ? Like we used to be . p. 54 PACE CREAGAN You asked me what I wanted with your son . GIN CHANCE I meant no harm , girl . A mother 's supposed to ask . PACE CREAGAN I was going to be different . I do n't know in what way . That never mattered . But different somehow . Do you know what I mean ? GIN CHANCE There 's blood on your leg . PACE CREAGAN And Dalton would be there to see it happen . That 's what I was getting him ready for . GIN CHANCE What are you doing out so late ? Where 's Dalton ? PACE CREAGAN He 'll be home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He 's not alone . He 's with a girl . GIN CHANCE Oh . Pace . I 'm sorry . PACE CREAGAN I 'm not . I was watching them . At first , I could n't see them . It was dark . And there was this noise , like water rushing . Right through my head . But then I looked harder and I could see them . He stood over her . He was shaking her . But she would n't get up . And he was shouting . Shouting so loud . He would n't shut up . GIN CHANCE Dalton would n't  --  No . Dalton 's  --  PACE CREAGAN ( Interrupts ) : But she would n't answer him . The girl just turned her head . She hates him , I thought . And that made me glad . And then he stopped shouting . He gave up and put his head on her breast . ( Beat ) And then , well . I saw it ; he kissed her . He kissed her . p. 55 GIN CHANCE There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him . I never let Dalton kiss me , but she did . And then , I felt him kiss her . I felt it . He was kissing her . Kissing her . But his mouth was inside of mine . And I let him . I let his mouth be inside of me like that , even though I was n't with him anymore . GIN CHANCE ( Moves to comfort Pace ) : Come here , girl . I 'm sorry . PACE CREAGAN ( Stepping backwards ) : Do n't touch the back of my head . GIN CHANCE Why not ? PACE CREAGAN It 's gone . ( We hear a door slam loudly . ) GIN CHANCE Dalton ? Dalton ! ( We hear the loud slamming of the door , like a cell . The slamming echoes . Blackout. ) @x Dalton 's cell . It 's dark . Then a light appears . It 's Chas . Dalton lies sleeping on the ground . Chas stands over Dalton , watching him sleep . CHAS WEAVER Least you could do is turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could guess it . I know water . ( Dalton moans in his sleep , like a child . Chas sings to put Dalton back to sleep . ) Rocking on the sea , looking for my soul , dead man 's blood from an old boat hole.Sail to the left , sail to the right , sail to the end in the cold moon light . ( The song ends . ) Sleep of the dead . That 's you . Creagan . Pace . Ring a bell ? In the dead . Of night . What 're you thinkin ' ? Are you there with her or somewhere else ? ( Standing over Dalton , he begins to peel an apple . He lets the bits of peel fall across Dalton 's face . ) Why do I spend my time on you , huh ? Could it be I know our friend across the hall is on his way out of here ? The poor man 's got no wind in his jail cell . Still , he 's doing this  --  ( Spins his head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a weather vane tonight . ( Beat ) I 'm waiting for you to surprise me , kid . Turn your head , open your mouth , roll your eyes , swish your feet and I 'll know it : you 're a fish of sorts . Could you do that ? Here ? Or am I wastin ' time , my time , when I could be over the sea fightin ' with Franco 's boys , bullets and dive-bombers whistlin ' and divin ' , and you here , sweet as baby 's breath , sleeping and moaning over a dead girl . And I 'm sharing my apple . What are county jails coming to . ( Softly chants : ) Apples , apples , buy a veteran 's apples , Sweet and hard as ruby rocks.Five cents a piece , two dollars for a box . Apples , apples , buy an old man 's apples , fought for his country , left on his back.Wo n't you taste his apples , they 're black , black , black ? Whatever you are my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little by little , you 'll stop sleeping too . ( The peels falling on Dalton 's face finally wake him . He screams himself awake . He sits up , not knowing where he is . ) Another one , kid . That 's about three a night now . You 're sweating ' til you stink . Hey . I got a good one . What 's this  --  ( Chas gets down on all fours and acts out something contorted and disturbing . ) Come on . Make a wild guess . I 'll give you a buck . And a hint : it 's something you ca n't see , but it 's there from the moment you 're born ' til the moment you die . What is it ? ( Chas repeats the act . This time it 's more grotesque . He comes up close to Dalton , too close , and Dalton backs away , frightened . ) Give up ? ( Beat ) It 's your soul . ( After some moments : ) p. 57 DALTON CHANCE ( Quietly ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks ! And what does he tell me ? Go to hell . Go to hell . That 's us in here , is n't it ? Just you and me , hour after hour . So tell me . Why 'd you kill her ? Think she was pregnant ? Well , she was n't . But they say you got a chance if you say you thought she was . Do n't you want a chance , Chance ? ( Beat ) Why 'd you kill Pace Creagan ? DALTON CHANCE Do n't . Say her name . CHAS WEAVER Pretty name . Strange . Strange girl , too . Lucky she was n't more of a girl . More of a girl , and they 'd hang you for sure . That 's what they 're saying . Seen her parents since ? No . But I have . Like two gray sticks , the man and the wife , so thin with grief they are . As they walk , the wind blows them from one side of the road to the other . You did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid . A box of crackers . You opened her up , took a handful and threw the rest away . ( Dalton gets to his feet . ) That 's it , boy . That 's it . Let 's see some life in you . I know what 's inside of you . Do n't think I do n't know . Here ? ( Throws his small knife down on the floor between them ) There it is , boy . You can use it . Go on . Show me what you really are . What happened that night , huh ? Lose your nerve ? You tried though . We know that . Dress all torn up . Head smashed . She must have put up a hell of a fight . I bet you liked that . That 's the way you kids like it . All that fightin ' hoists your flag , gets you flappin ' . Got you so edged , you could n't hold it in . Could n't wait . Shot your come all over her dress but missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . But Pace Creagan died a virgin . That 's what the doctor says . ( Dalton moves away from Chas . After some moments , Chas picks up the knife . He speaks gently . ) You want to kill me , do n't you ? ( Dalton shakes his head no . ) I can see the hate rising out the top of your head like steam . Here , take this . Go on . ( Holds out the knife ) You got to face up to what you are . You 're a killer . A kid with a head full of black water . Everything sunk . Everything drowned inside you . ( Chas forces Dalton to hold the knife . Chas forces the knife up to his own throat . Dalton is passive . Chas whispers : ) Go on . It 's what makes you whole . ( Chas laughs softly . Then suddenly Dalton shouts and forces Chas backward . Dalton forces Chas to the floor with the knife to his neck. ) p. 58 DALTON CHANCE I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Seems as though he could kill Chas at any moment ) I ca n't even imagine it . Killing someone like you . With her . With Pace . I could imagine it . This what you want to hear ? Okay , then . Like her parents , she was just a stick . I picked her up , carried her a little ways , and when I got tired , I broke her  --  snap  --  in half . Threw the pieces to the side . Those are the facts . It was that easy . You want a reason ? Okay : the only way to love someone is to kill them . ( Dalton releases Chas . But as he moves away , Chas suddenly grabs at his leg . Dalton attempts to shake him off , even drag him , but Chas holds on , lying on his belly . This makes for an irritating  --  and almost comical  --  interruption for Dalton 's words . ) Goddamn it I did what I was told  --  ( Drags Chas a little ways )  --  became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of future , ' bout as big as a dime . Only there was n't one  --  let go of my leg  --  there never was for most of us . That was the plan and it never was ours . But I bought that plan anyway  --  get off of me  --  ' cause it was the only thing to buy . Those are the facts . This is n't about who we are . This is n't about what we wanted . ( With effort , Dalton breaks free . Chas lies still on the floor , looking up at him . ) My country loves me . That 's why it 's killing me . It 's killing my father . Those are the facts . Those are the facts of love . ( After some moments , Chas gets to his feet. ) p. 59 CHAS WEAVER You . You 're not our children . We do n't want you . DALTON CHANCE What you were making earlier ? That was n't my soul . ( Beat ) That was yours . p. 60 Act 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blue plates behind her back . Dray has cornered her . DRAY CHANCE Give them to me . GIN CHANCE Get out of this house and get your own . These were my mother 's . I wo n't do it anymore . The Salvation was out . The woman there says to me , " What 're you doing with all those plates , ma'am . " I said , " There 's no food anymore . We eat them . " I went down the road . I stopped at the dump . Next thing I 'm on my hands and knees , digging through garbage to find something for you to break . That 's when I started laughing . Laughed so hard two rats flew out from under me . DRAY CHANCE Just give me one . GIN CHANCE Not one . Not two . Not ever again . DRAY CHANCE Gin . GIN CHANCE Go to the jail and visit your son . Get outside . Tear the bricks from the sidewalk if you have to . I do n't care . DRAY CHANCE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? DRAY CHANCE That if I go out , they wo n't be able to see me . GIN CHANCE Who ? Who wo n't be able to see you ? p. 61 DRAY CHANCE People . Out walking in the road . GIN CHANCE Yes they will . DRAY CHANCE They 'll walk right through me . ( Slowly takes off his shirt , seemingly unconsciously while he speaks ) My mother used to tell me , " Dray . You are what you do . " In the foundry , it 's no rest and you 've always got a burn somewhere . I never minded . I was doing . I was part of the work . Part of the day . I was . I do n't know . Burning . Freezing up . Inside that buzz . Melting down alongside thirty other men . But we were there . You could see us , and we were n't just making steel , we were . I do n't know . We were . Making ourselves . We were . I was . All that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So . Then I am . What ? Yeah . Nothing . GIN CHANCE Go talk to them . They understand . They 'll listen . DRAY CHANCE I wo n't have anything to do with the Council . I know what they 're up to . They 're gon na take something that 's not theirs . They 're gon na break the law . GIN CHANCE Yeah , well sometimes you break the law or it breaks you . DRAY CHANCE Red thoughts , Ginny . GIN CHANCE Yeah . My thoughts are red and my hands are blue . ( Dray begins to methodically rip his shirt into pieces as he speaks . This is a violent act , but somehow he does it calmly , simply. ) p. 62 DRAY CHANCE They were running . Like all of us are . A few months back , up North . You know the story . ( Rips the cloth ) A strike . Out on the street . Thousands of them . Doing something about it ( Rips the cloth ) like you say . Republic Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them strikers . ( Rips the cloth ) Papers said the strikers started it . Weeks later . It got around . They were running away . ( Rips the cloth ) The bullets hit them in the back . GIN CHANCE I never said I was n't afraid . ( Dray is finished with his shirt , and is very calm . ) DRAY CHANCE You can go ahead now . If you want . GIN CHANCE Where ? DRAY CHANCE I do n't know . ( Gin carefully , hesitantly touches his bare arm . Dray closes his eyes . She touches his chest . He flinches slightly . ) You 're cold , Gin . ( She keeps touching him . Now his back . ) But it 's nice . It almost burns . ( Beat . ) There . That 's enough . GIN CHANCE I do n't want to stop . DRAY CHANCE I do n't want to either . p. 63 GIN CHANCE I want you to kiss me . DRAY CHANCE I ca n't . I might hurt you . GIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Get away from me . ( Suddenly furious ) I want you . Ca n't you understand that ? I want you and it 's choking me . Look at me : I do n't know how to belong to my life . To be here . Not knowing where here is anymore . Am I here , Ginny ? What you 're looking at  --  is it me ? ( After some moments : ) GIN CHANCE I 'm going into that plant with the rest of them . I 'm going to work with glass . We 're going to make it ours . But I 'm a coward . If they come after us , I 'll run too . But I wo n't live . Like this anymore . DRAY CHANCE You want me to leave ? GIN CHANCE I want you to do something . DRAY CHANCE I ca n't . GIN CHANCE ( Calmly ) : I love you . So . I 'll leave you behind . p. 64 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE Pace and Dalton at the trestle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton holds out her dress to her . Something unsettling has happened between them , though we do n't know what . Pace takes the dress , looks at it . DALTON CHANCE Pace . What was that ? What just happened . PACE CREAGAN You tell me . DALTON CHANCE That was n't . No . That was n't . Right . PACE CREAGAN ( Examining the dress ) : You made it wet . DALTON CHANCE I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to . ( Pace throws the dress aside . ) PACE CREAGAN Dalton Chance , when we 're grown up , I want to stand here with you and not be afraid . I want to know it will be okay . Tonight . Tomorrow . That when it 's time to work , I 'll have work . That when I 'm tired , I can rest . Just those things . Should n't they belong to us ? DALTON CHANCE What do you want from me ? PACE CREAGAN I want you to watch me , to tell me I 'm here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to tell you . p. 65 PACE CREAGAN Yes I do . So watch me . Whatever I do . Take a good look . Make some notes . ' Cause one day I might come back here to find out who I was  --  and then you 're going to tell me . DALTON CHANCE I do n't . Damn it . I do n't know what you mean . PACE CREAGAN Look , it 's simple  --  DALTON CHANCE ( Interrupts ) : Stop it . Every time we meet , afterwards , it 's like pieces of me . Keep falling off . It should n't be that way , Pace . Something 's got to come clear . To make sense . I keep waiting . I ca n't do it anymore . PACE CREAGAN All right . Then tonight we 'll run her . DALTON CHANCE No . Not tonight . PACE CREAGAN Tonight . DALTON CHANCE That 's not what I 'm waiting for . It 's just a train . PACE CREAGAN Yeah . Well it 's going somewhere . And it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll run it tonight . DALTON CHANCE No . Not me . That was just a game . PACE CREAGAN We 've been working on this for weeks . You ca n't back down . It 's time . I can feel it . Everything 's quiet . Everything 's waiting . Listen ? Here how quiet it is  --  p. 66 DALTON CHANCE ( Interrupts ) : It 's just talk , Pace . Just talk . This used to be fun . That 's gone . You 're gone . I do n't know where but you 're gone . PACE CREAGAN I could hurt you . ( Takes out her knife ) DALTON CHANCE I 'm not afraid of your knife . You could cut me open but I 'd still leave . ( Pace jumps him and knocks him down . She sits on him . ) PACE CREAGAN What 's the matter with you ? DALTON CHANCE You said you 'd change me . You did , goddamn it . Now change me back . PACE CREAGAN I ca n't . DALTON CHANCE Yes you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DALTON CHANCE I do n't know . How the hell am I to know ? I did n't do it . You did it . You brought me here . You talked and talked . You put your hands inside my head . You kissed me without kissing me . Tonight . Finally tonight . But not like a girl should . You fucked me but I was n't even inside you . It 's ridiculous . This is n't how I want to be . PACE CREAGAN How do you want to be ? DALTON CHANCE Normal . Like any other kid . And satisfied . Like I used to be . Just satisfied . And now . Now I want everything . You did this to me. p. 67 PACE CREAGAN Say it . DALTON CHANCE No . PACE CREAGAN Say it . DALTON CHANCE No . PACE CREAGAN I hate you , Pace Creagan . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . I do ! ( Beat . He 's quiet now . ) And there are times I 've never been happier ; I ca n't forgive you for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of him . She starts to leave . ) Where you going ? Pace . Hey . Pace . ( She leaves. ) p. 68 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Dalton in his cell , still on his back . Dray enters , quiet and bewildered . He carries a small pillow . At first , Dalton tries to ignore him ; he does n't look at Dray as they speak . DALTON CHANCE I was just going to sleep . DRAY CHANCE Yes . I know it 's late . DALTON CHANCE Why did you come ? DRAY CHANCE Is n't it natural a father would come ? DALTON CHANCE You 've hardly left the house in months . ( Dray holds out the pillow to Dalton . ) DRAY CHANCE I brought you your pillow . ( Dalton does n't take it . ) DALTON CHANCE That 's not my pillow . DRAY CHANCE It 's not ? DALTON CHANCE I have n't used it for years . The feathers are poking out of it . I used to wake up in the night and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dray runs his hand over the pillow . He finds a feather and pulls it out . ) DRAY CHANCE Yeah . There 's one . ( Finds another ) Here 's another . ( Dray continues to gently comb and search the pillow and pull out a feather here and a feather there , sparingly , as the scene continues . Dalton watches this strangely tender exercise . Dray looks at each feather he removes , then forgets it as he goes on to another . The feathers float unnoticed to the ground. ) p. 69 DALTON CHANCE I do n't sleep much in here anyway . ( Dalton watches Dray pull the feathers . ) So are you going to roast it after you pluck it ? DRAY CHANCE Not as bad as I thought it 'd be . Walking the street again . DALTON CHANCE It 's about time . DRAY CHANCE ' Course I did have this pillow to hide my face in . You think anyone saw me ? DALTON CHANCE I hope not . DRAY CHANCE There 's something I want you to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRAY CHANCE I want you to touch me . ( Dalton does not respond . ) Does the thought . Disgust you ? DALTON CHANCE You have n't let me . In a long time . ( Dray advances . Dalton is suddenly furious . ) Stop right there . Do n't , goddamn it ! ( Beat ) You think you can come . In here . ( Rips the pillow out of Dray 's hands and throws it aside ) After all this time with this fucking pillow and everything 's going to be okay ? Yeah . It disgusts me . You disgust me . Like a little fucking kid sitting in your corner week after week waiting for the world to stop . Well it did , Father . At least for me . No . I do n't want to touch you . What difference could that make now ? To me , you 're just a noise in the corner . I wo n't even notice when you go . ( They are quiet some moments . Dray does not move to leave . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to live . Like this . DALTON CHANCE How ? DRAY CHANCE Unchanged . Your skin 's warm . I can feel it from here . So close to me you smell of . Berries . I do n't know . Gasoline . And somewhere behind it all something like , something like . I do n't know . I do n't  --  All my life I wanted to say something that mattered . ( Beat ) I do n't know why . I do n't know why . I came . DALTON CHANCE To bring me my pillow . ( Beat ) Go home . ( Dray sits . ) DRAY CHANCE What happens when we die ? DALTON CHANCE They 're going to hang me . Do you understand ? I told them I killed her . DRAY CHANCE Did you kill her ? DALTON CHANCE I do n't know . DRAY CHANCE I think when we die , we just . Disappear . A few handfuls of nothing maybe . And that 's it . What do you think ? ( Dalton sits down beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHANCE We just lie down and we do n't get back up . DRAY CHANCE Will it be terrible ? p. 71 DALTON CHANCE Some people think there 's a light . Some say it comes from above . I do n't believe it . If there 's anything at all , it 'll come up from under the ground . Where we do n't expect it . A light . A warm light and it 'll cover us . DRAY CHANCE What color is the light ? DALTON CHANCE Who knows . DRAY CHANCE Red . I think it should be red . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . Like the sun , when you look at it with your eyes closed . ( After some moments ) I 'll touch you now . If you want . DRAY CHANCE I 'm going to close my eyes . DALTON CHANCE Why ? DRAY CHANCE So no one will see us . ( Dray closes his eyes . Dalton awkwardly rests his head on his father 's shoulder or knee . It is a small gesture . They sit this way together some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After some moments of silence Dray gets to his feet . ) DALTON CHANCE Wait a minute . I want you to show me how to make a shadow on the wall . Anything . I do n't care what . ( Dray takes the pillow with him . ) DRAY CHANCE It 'll take too long . p. 72 DALTON CHANCE I got the time . DRAY CHANCE ( Looking at the small bunch of feathers on the floor ) : As though a bird had died here . ( Dray leaves . ) DALTON CHANCE Wait a minute . Wait . ( Dalton looks , surprised , at the floor around him . The feathers stir as though a breeze had passed through them. ) p. 73 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE Dray meets Chas as he leaves the cell . They stop and stare at each other . Elsewhere on stage , a feather falls on Dalton , though now Dalton does not seem to notice . A few more fall as the scene progresses . CHAS WEAVER Never stops talking about you . Thinks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't respond . ) Way a son should . Just like mine . DRAY CHANCE He 's dead . CHAS WEAVER Looks pretty lively to me . DRAY CHANCE ( Interrupting ) : Yours . I mean . ( There is an awkward silence . ) CHAS WEAVER You 're out of work . I 've got this job . DRAY CHANCE Your son was on the track team . CHAS WEAVER I trained him . Out the old road to the cutoff in Eastwood . DRAY CHANCE I 've got to go . CHAS WEAVER He says you do shadows . DRAY CHANCE What of it ? CHAS WEAVER Hey . What 's this ? Your son never guessed it . ( Chas imitates a plane doing a perilous landing . No sound . Dray considers him carefully. ) p. 74 DRAY CHANCE Baby elephant . CHAS WEAVER Elephant ? Like father like son . Wrong , but close . An airplane . Motor gone dead . Doing a dead-stick landing . In slow motion of course . DRAY CHANCE Okay . This ? ( Dray acts out a camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dray 's every movement . Dray seems to come alive in this charade , in a way we have n't witnessed before . ) CHAS WEAVER Nothing else but a camel , probably a dromedary . ( Dray stands stunned . ) DRAY CHANCE Yeah . CHAS WEAVER Not bad at all . Can you do a windmill ? DRAY CHANCE I got to go . CHAS WEAVER Wait , wait , we just started . I could teach you . I 'm teaching your son . DRAY CHANCE Save it for your own . Good-bye . ( He does n't move ) CHAS WEAVER I 'm sort of practicing . For him . You know ? DRAY CHANCE You 're pretty good . CHAS WEAVER He was asking for that pillow . DRAY CHANCE It 's not his . ( Dray leaves . We hear the sound of someone blowing air , as though someone were blowing out matches , but more gently. ) p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX Pace and Dalton are sitting together , a few feet apart . Pace is blowing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the silence . Pace blows the feather into the air , and keeps it above her head , blowing on it , just a little , each time it descends . She lets it land on her upturned face . Dalton watches Pace . Pace sees him watching her . She gives him the feather . He tries to copy her . He does so , but badly . Pace just watches . And laughs . They are enjoying themselves . Then Dalton " gets " it . He knows how to do it . He blows the feather up and keeps it in the air . Pace watches him . Then he lets the feather float slowly down between them . They are both quietly happy . Because they no longer feel alone . Because they are watching each other just being alive . p. 76 Act 2 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN Chas is sweeping up the feathers in Dalton 's cell . Dalton 's back is turned . CHAS WEAVER What do you expect ? A hotel or something . There 's holes in the roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of the world . They 're moving you tomorrow . The trial 'll start . It 'll be the last of us . Empty cell . Might never get filled , then I 'd have to find something else . Move to another jail . Might be no more criminals , not even a rich man who thinks he 's a crab . Scuttlin ' back and forth . Makes sweeping a devil 's job . I can tell you . Still . ( Pokes the broom into Dalton 's turned back ) You gon na tell them the truth this time ? Only witness was you . Huh , huh ? No explanation . No defense . Look , kid . If you talk , if you give them something to make them think you 're crazy or sorry or scared , they might not hang you . If you do n't talk , they will . Those are the facts . ( Dalton does n't respond . Chas tut-tuts at him . ) A nice-faced boy like you . I had a nice-faced boy . ( Keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . I could knock you down and sweep you up like you were nothing but a scrap of dust . ( Suddenly Dalton turns and grabs the broom . ) DALTON CHANCE Hey . Guess what this is ? ( Dalton slaps himself in the face . Then again . Then he starts to pull his own hair and hit himself , as though someone else is hitting him . He beats himself to the ground in an ugly , violent and awkward manner . Chas watches . Slowly he backs away . They are silent. ) p. 77 CHAS WEAVER I 've been good to you . DALTON CHANCE Yeah . Brett was a nice boy . He used to hit himself . I saw him do it . Why was he like that ? He was a fucking loon , that 's why . CHAS WEAVER Brett was n't a loon . ( Beat ) Sometimes . Well . I hit him . In the mornings , right before he went to school . Just about the time he 'd start on a bowl of cereal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Pace . Your Pace . But I 'd hit him anyway . Brett liked her to see it . After I hit him , Brett would take Pace aside and ask her if she saw it . Of course she saw it . She was standing right beside him ! But Brett wanted to make sure . Then one morning I 'm just about to hit him when he says , " Wait a minute , Dad . You 've got a headache so you just sit back down and take it easy . I 'll take care of it . " So Brett hauls off and hits himself in the mouth . And I mean hard . His lip busts and starts bleeding . I 'm so surprised that I sit back down and just stare at him . Next morning , the same thing . Brett stands in front of me and hits himself in the face . Twice . I do n't say a thing . I just watch . Sometimes him doing it himself , instead of me , made us laugh . Together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat ) I knew Brett ran that train . It was n't the first time . Maybe it was fate . DALTON CHANCE It was n't fate . It was a train . Five hundred and sixty tons of it . p. 78 CHAS WEAVER He was . My son . He was waiting . For me to give him something . I could n't stand it ; I did n't have anything to give him . A key to a cell , maybe . A broom to go with it . Is that what you give your child when he grows up ? I did n't have anything to give him . So I hit him . I could give him that . ( Dalton puts his hands in the feathers . He looks up . ) DALTON CHANCE How do the birds get in ? There 's no hole in this roof . CHAS WEAVER What do we do afterwards ? I loved him . Years from now ? DALTON CHANCE What we wanted . It was to live . Just to live . ( Chas begins sweeping again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Dalton 's hands . ) CHAS WEAVER I got to finish up here . Word is there 's gon na be trouble down at the Plate Glass factory . Might be some new guests to replace you any day now . DALTON CHANCE About your son . I 'm sorry . CHAS WEAVER Ah . It seems so long ago now ; it 's all I think about . ( Beat ) Hey , last chance , kid . Guess what I am ? ( Sweeps the broom a little wider , almost a figure eight motion , but without much effort ) p. 79 DALTON CHANCE A giraffe . Grazing . The broom 's your neck . CHAS WEAVER No . Just an old man . Sweeping the floor of his cell . ( Dalton stops the broom with his hand . ) DALTON CHANCE Tell them I 'm ready to talk . CHAS WEAVER We 're all asleep . It 'll have to wait ' til morning . ( He leaves . ) DALTON CHANCE Hey . I want to talk now . Open the door . Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( At first he shouts to Chas , who is offstage , then he speaks to himself and finally , he is telling us , as though we were the jury , what happened : ) ( Shouting ) Pace wanted to make the run that night . I would n't do it . I was afraid . No , I was angry . ( Pace appears . Dalton does n't see her but sometimes senses she might be there . ) PACE CREAGAN You messed all over my dress ! DALTON CHANCE But I did n't touch her ! I was . Upside down . I was . Goddamn it  --  PACE CREAGAN You do n't know what you were . DALTON CHANCE I told her to run it alone . p. 80 PACE CREAGAN You dared me . DALTON CHANCE Pace never could say no to a dare . She stood on the tracks . She was covered in sweat . I stood below the trestle . She looked small up there , near a hundred feet above me . But until she started to run , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CREAGAN I had it made . Bastard . I needed you to watch  --  DALTON CHANCE I could hear her footsteps . Fast , fast  --  PACE CREAGAN Because we ca n't watch ourselves . We ca n't remember ourselves . Not like we need to . DALTON CHANCE Christ , I did n't know she could run like that ! She was halfway . She had it crossed . But then I. PACE CREAGAN Turned around . You just . Did it . ( She disappears ) DALTON CHANCE Then I. Just did it . I turned . Around . ( Dalton is propelled into the past moment . Now he can see Pace . But where he looks to see her , high up , we see nothing . The Pace that Dalton sees we can not see , and the Pace we see is not the Pace that Dalton sees . Elsewhere , we see Pace climbing up the trestle . Dalton shouts at the Pace we ca n't see . ) No ! No way ! I wo n't be your fucking witness ! You 're warped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Beat ) Stop . You better stop ! ( Pace reappears , very high up on what might be a piece of track . She calls to Dalton : ) p. 81 PACE CREAGAN Dalton . Watch me . Hey ! Watch me . DALTON CHANCE No . Damn you . ( Dalton turns around , so that his back is to both the Pace we can see , and the other Pace we can not see . ) PACE CREAGAN Dalton . Turn around . Watch me . ( Dalton is furious and torn . He covers his ears and shouts : ) DALTON CHANCE Goddamn you , Pace Creagan ! ( Now he is back in the present , and he speaks to us . Pace remains very still on the track . ) But I would n't turn around . Pace must 've slowed down . And lost her speed , when she was calling to me . Pace started to run back but she knew she 'd never make it . And then she turned . Even from where I was at , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like she was saying : No . No . No . ( Beat ) She did n't want to die . ( Pace puts her arms over her head , like she is going to dive . ) And then she did something funny . Pace could n't even swim and there was no water in the creek , but she was going to dive . PACE CREAGAN Watch me . Dalton . DALTON CHANCE And this time . I watched her . ( This time Dalton turns around , and for the first time looks at the Pace that we can also see . We all watch Pace . She moves as if to dive ; there is the tremendous , deafening roar of a train that sounds almost like an explosion , different from the other train sounds we have heard . Then Pace is gone and we see nothing more of her . Dalton is alone and speaks quietly : ) Pace lay beside the trestle . She was n't mashed up from the fall . Only the back of her head . I started to shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . Even a few she 'd taught me herself . ( Beat ) And then . And then I did something . Something I ca n't . I do n't know . It was . Maybe . It was . Unforgivable . I knelt beside her . Pace never let me kiss her , like that . So I did . And she did n't try to stop me . How could she ? That 's what I ca n't forget . She once said to me : " Dalton , you ca n't take anything from me I do n't want to give you . " But then she opened her mouth . She was dead . But she opened her mouth . And I kissed her , the way I 'd always wanted to . And she let me . ( Beat ) She let me . ( Beat ) I have to believe that . ( A moment later , we see Chas . He lets Dalton out of his jail cell . We know Dalton is freed. ) p. 82 p. 83 Act 2 , Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still . Gin is holding a large piece of glass in her hands , which has a small break on one side . GIN CHANCE We 've swept the place out . Most of the machinery 's all right . Glass everywhere . Like hail . We scooped it up . By the bucketful . Three girls from my work are with me . About thirty others . From all over . We threw lots of this out . Thought I 'd bring some home . We can use it in the back door . ( Calmly ) Put that away . ( Now we see that the shadow Dray is making is a gun . And the gun is not a shadow . ) DRAY CHANCE I went to see Dalton . He said at night when he slept , his face was full of nails . All these years . And I did n't know . ( Beat ) Come here . GIN CHANCE I 've got to get back to the plant . Are you coming with me ? DRAY CHANCE Just come here . ( Gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the gun . She just stands there with the gun hanging at her side , ignoring it . ) GIN CHANCE Almost a shame to sweep up that glass . It was so bright in there . The sun through the windows , hitting the glass on the floor  --  ( Dray turns to Gin and lifts her hand so the gun is at his forehead. ) p. 84 DRAY CHANCE Ginny . GIN CHANCE  --  like we were standing on a lake of ice that was turning to fire right under our feet . DRAY CHANCE Change me . ( Gin does not respond . ) Please . Please . Change me .

He slowly stands up . Pace moves toward the candle . For one moment , Pace and Dalton look at one another . Pace crouches over the candle . Dalton makes a slight movement , as though touching his mouth . Then he raises his arms , as though welcoming her vision . Pace blows out the candle ; at the same moment Dalton seems to do the same . We hear the sound of the candle going out . Blackout. )      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
