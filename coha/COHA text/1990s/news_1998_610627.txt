<p> " I hope some day , " Harry Truman wrote in 1960 , " someone will take time to evaluate the true role of the wife of a president , and to assess the many burdens she has to bear and the contributions she makes . " <p> Nearly 40 years later , that prospect is about to become reality . Tomorrow at the Renwick Gallery , the creation of the National First Ladies ' Library , including a comprehensive online annotated bibliography , will be announced . The library 's books , documents and audiotapes will be located in Canton , Ohio , in the childhood home of Ida Saxton McKinley , the 20th first lady . But the virtual library will be available to anyone with a computer and a modem . <p> The bibliography will not shy away from controversial aspects of the 43 first ladies ' lives , said author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony , who compiled it . <p> On the Florence Harding page , for instance , a researcher will be able to reference a book by Warren Harding 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore his daughter . She wrote in detail about assignations with the president , which she said took place in an anteroom off the Oval Office . <p> Similarly , stories about Hillary Rodham Clinton 's role in dealing with the current presidential imbroglio will be listed , but not until 1999 , Anthony cautioned . The bibliography , he said , will be updated each January . It will be launched next month , by Mrs. Clinton , who is scheduled to access the new database for the first time from her White House computer . <p> The new library is " just kind of asking for equal time , trying to ensure there is equal focus and emphasis given and an equal history , " said Frances Hughes Glendening , Maryland 's first lady and the library 's vice chairwoman . " That 's the whole point : There is a significant gap in our historical perspective because we do not chronicle the achievements , accomplishments and contributions of women . " <p> From the beginning , first ladies have been controversial . <p> " Almost regardless of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hillary Clinton said in a recent interview . " There was n't any safe harbor in the public arena or any particular choice that would be universally accepted . " <p> Two centuries ago , in a letter delivered to her niece , the first first lady , Martha Washington , lamented that her role was " more like a state prisoner than anything else . " Eleanor Roosevelt , 150 years later , traveled the country on behalf of her ailing husband and was criticized for it . But in the last half century , Americans have accepted a limited public role for presidents ' wives . <p> " First ladies are aware that they have this great platform that they 'll never have again , " Nancy Reagan said in a phone interview from California . " It goes by very , very quickly . If you do n't use it , you 're a fool , " said Mrs. Reagan , who launched the memorable " Just Say No " program against drug abuse . <p> The library , said Rosalynn Carter from Atlanta , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teachers , students and biographers . They 're really the ones who influence opinion . " <p> In addition to providing a repository for the papers of those first ladies whose husbands do n't have presidential libraries , Mrs. Clinton said , the new library will demonstrate that " there is n't any cookie-cutter formula for being a first lady . " <p> Since the authors of the Constitution neglected to provide a job description for the first lady , " what you get , " said Edith Mayo , the library 's executive adviser , " is women using everyday life and everyday materials to structure a really important role , created out of a vacuum . It 's quite a stunning achievement . " <p> Mayo was the curator who revamped the popular exhibit on first ladies at the National Museum of American History in 1992 , focusing more on the developing political role , public image and contributions of first ladies than on their gowns . Inside the museum , initial reaction to the change was " cautious , " she said . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women visitors were only interested in gowns . A variation on that is : What could first ladies ever have done that could possibly be interesting that you could put into an exhibition ? " Mayo said . " When they found there was interesting material , that died away . And then the question was : Would the public like it ? " <p> The exhibit remains the most popular in the museum . <p> Until recently , " even women 's historians were not particularly interested in first ladies ' history , " Mayo said . " The perception was that these women had not achieved on their own , but through marriage to a man who ultimately became president . " <p> Yet today , as Mrs. Carter said , the public has " a fascination " with the position . " A natural curiosity , " said Mrs. Reagan . All six living first ladies are honorary chairwomen of the library . <p> It took another political wife to organize the grass-roots effort that has established the library . Mary Rodusky Regula , a former schoolteacher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she had long been frustrated by how little people seem to know about the presidents ' wives . " It was n't until the 1970s , " she said , " that we decided women had any part in this nation 's history . " <p> Regula began a fund-raising campaign after she was unable to find good reference material about Mary Todd Lincoln for a speech she had to deliver . When a search of the Library of Congress and presidential sites around the country turned up nothing , she set out to fill the void . <p> Her husband , then ranking minority member on the Interior subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee , had been instrumental in negotiating a deal under which a local Ohio nonprofit organization was permitted to occupy the old McKinley home in return for its upkeep and interior renovation . That arrangement called for setting aside several public rooms , and this is the space the new library will occupy . Its computerized database will be located two doors away in a seven-story building and will be maintained by Stark State College of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian house was where Ida Saxton McKinley grew up and became engaged to future president William McKinley . It served as their home away from Washington during his 14 years in Congress , and after McKinley was assassinated , she lived there until her death in 1907 . <p> At various times a tavern , an inn and a brothel , the house was restored in the 1970s by Saxton descendants . In 1991 , because it was the only remaining home of President McKinley , the National Park Service bought the house for $ 1.1 million and turned occupancy over to the Stark Foundation on the condition that no additional federal funds be spent on it . <p> At first , Mary Regula envisioned leaving the rooms as they were . But as she and her 13-member site committee got deeper into the project , expectations grew . They planned to duplicate the Victorian decor of McKinley 's era as closely as possible . This entailed , for example , 18 different wallpaper patterns in the parlor alone . <p> The library 's goals expanded , as well , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the first annual First Women Awards Dinner will be held in Washington in early May ) and women 's history in general . <p> That field of study has grown increasingly popular on U.S. campuses and now focuses on " the intersection of the public and private lives of women , " Mayo said . " The first ladies are the major exemplars of when your private life becomes public . " <p> Kent State University President Carol Cartwright , a member of the advisory board , said the library will be relevant because the changing roles of presidents ' wives , " from social hostess to social activist and from silent partner to full partner , " mirrors the changing roles of all American women . <p> Still , " people should n't mistake this as a feminist issue , " said Ray Ivey , vice president of the Consolidated Natural Gas Foundation and one of five men on the library 's 17-member board of directors . " It 's not an advocacy organization . The fact that John Adams 's wife beat him up constantly because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution they were writing is immaterial . " <p> In discussing the project , the current and former first ladies kept coming back to the trials they faced trying to take on social issues during their time in the White House . <p> " It was really hard for me to convey to the American people what I was trying to do on mental health , " Mrs. Carter said . " After the first few meetings no reporters would come . One told me it was n't a sexy issue . " <p> " I know that nobody in the White House was really very happy about my taking on the drug program , " Mrs. Reagan said . " Everybody thought it should be something else . They would have preferred that I take on something less controversial . " <p> Mrs. Clinton , who knows something about controversy , said that although the library will include the journals of several first ladies , historians wo n't find hers there . She is n't keeping one . <p> Why not ? <p> " I just think , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to do . "
