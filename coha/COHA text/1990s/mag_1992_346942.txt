The other evening , three guys ran across Candlestick Park brandishing a bed- sheet sign that read PLEASE DO N'T GO ! Stung by the announced sale of the San Francisco Giants to a consortium representing St. Petersburg , Florida , these three were exercising the birthright of any sports devotee : impotent pleading . This was the charge of the night brigade . But the trio might as well have been riding into the Valley of Death instead of invading the blustery pasture of America 's crankiest ball park . The people who buy the tickets , whose taxes pay for the stadiums , who fantasize and fret over their team like anxious parents  --  they are mighty Casey at the bat . All muscle , no magic . Strike three . You 're out . Game 's over . The fans fan . <P> Fan , of course , is short for fanatic . Nothing else explains the loyalty , the emotional servitude of otherwise sensible folks toward a professional sports franchise . Talk to the proprietors of major league teams and you will hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average player 's salary topping $1 million this year , attendance slumping and TV revenue due to drop in 1994 , the owners seem noble just to stay in the game , given all that hemorrhaging red ink . <P> Perhaps the owners have more mercenary motives . Like going where the money is . As one of half a dozen owners with a fortune in excess of a billion dollars , Jack Kent Cooke probably has enough money now . Cooke owns the N.F.L. champion Washington Redskins , but like many a Joe Lunchpail , he wants to move to the suburbs . Move the Redskins , that is , to a rail yard in Alexandria , Virginia . No matter that Washington does n't want the ' Skins to leave and Alexandria does n't want them to come . In a secret deal whose conspiratorial bravado would have set Boss Tweed and Mark Hanna drooling , Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder offered $130 million to construct roads and rail links to a stadium Cooke would build and own . And Cooke gets to keep all proceeds from food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System , a state pension fund , paid $350 million for these 320 acres of land , intending to develop it for mixed commercial-residential use . This is still mixed use : Cooke has use for free land and Wilder for political glory . Virginians with sharp ears could catch the sound of a state pocket being picked . Says Congressman Jim Moran of a plan that would bring the city few economic perks : " It is a classic case of how not to conduct public policy . " Officials in Washington could only fear that getting Skinned meant the town would be rubbed off the map . " Brooklyn has never been the same since the Dodgers left , " keened D.C. council chairman John Wilson , whose own city lost two baseball clubs in the 1950s . " You do n't even think about Brooklyn . "
