Julia Malberg is a 76-year-old Maryland widow living on the edge of poverty . Her standard of living has dropped dramatically since the days when she raised six children on her husband 's salary as a truck driver . " Right now I do n't buy a lot , " she says . " I just wear what the kids hand me down , and I do without a lot of things I 'd like to have . " With only $674 a month in Social Security payments , Malberg , like most older women , has to ration her finances . " Because of the money " she has n't had a complete physical in four years . Though stories like Malberg 's are far from unique , President Clinton targeted Medicare  --  the government " entitlement " program that provides health benefits to more than 30 million older citizens  --  when he needed money last summer to reduce the budget deficit . Women will be hit hardest by the cuts . They generally live longer and poorer , outlasting men by seven years . Half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8,189 a year . They have to stretch every dollar to pay their bills . Clinton and Congress said they were only curbing the growth of Medicare . They said cutting $56 billion in Medicare spending over the next five years would have no direct impact on those who depend on these payments . Lobbyists for older people protested but then went back to their constituents and said things could be worse : an earlier deficit reduction proposal had called for $85 billion in cuts . So the lobbyists breathed a sigh of relief , patting themselves on the back for negotiating a better deal . But this victory was short-lived . Within a month , details of Clinton 's long-awaited health care reform program slipped out to the press : he planned to slash another $124 billion from Medicare to finance the health care reform package . Ironically , some seniors groups were sanguine about the proposal . Ardent supporters of deficit reduction , many members seemed concerned about their children and grandchildren , who could be hurt if the current leadership does n't get a grip on skyrocketing costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deficit and wants to do their share , " says Patricia Smith , chief health lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons ( AARP ) . Though the group has supported every deficit reduction bill in the last decade , it was ambivalent about this one . The AARP leadership sat on the fence over the initial budget cuts , opposing them but not wanting to oppose the administration 's deficit reduction bill . In the end , they thought it was more important that Clinton get his budget passed . " If this bill had not passed , " says Smith , " there would not be much chance that we could move into health care reform . " It 's already clear that the initial $56 billion in cuts will have a direct and negative impact on a select pocket of the population  --  the poorer recipients of Medicare . They will be paying more than they can afford and they may be getting fewer services from the medical community . By viewing Medicare as a funding source for a national health plan , Clinton has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the toughest battles to come before Congress . Medicare recipients are key players in the debate over who will pay to provide health care for the 37 million uninsured in this country . In essence , the government is robbing Peter ( Medicare recipients ) to pay Paul ( the uninsured ) . " It seems ironic that in order to give access to everyone they take away access from older people and poorer people , " says Charlotte Flynn , chair of the national board of the Gray Panthers , an anti-ageism activist group . Even so , the initial reaction of seniors groups to Clinton 's health care reform package was to hold their fire . But unless older people mount an expensive and vocal campaign to protect their interests , their ability to pay their health bills and their access to decent medical care will be severely threatened . Medicare is set up like a fee-for-service health insurance plan . The recipient pays a monthly premium , and the program usually pays 80 percent of the cost of doctors ' visits , with a $100 annual deductible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As part of the $56 billion budget deficit reduction package , by 1998 the premium will rise to $62.20 . That 's almost a 70 percent increase , which may not severely affect older people who have higher incomes , but will make a big difference for women like Malberg . " I get along on small Social Security checks , " she says . " That 's all I have . If they keep dipping into that I do n't know how they expect somebody like me to live . " Ruth Hodge will also be hurt . A 74-year-old widow from Independence , Kansas , she worked until she was 65 , first in a factory making radio parts and then in a publishing company putting together city directories . Today , all she has left is $530 a month in Social Security payments and $34 a year in interest from a small certificate of deposit . If things get any tighter , Hodge says , " I 'll probably have to give up my fresh fruits and vegetables . " Why should women like Ruth Hodge have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And if she does n't pay , who will ? The fight over the health care package is going to be long and ugly . Special interests will spend millions of dollars on lobbying , and seniors advocates will have to be heard over the voices of other , very powerful interest groups , such as those for doctors , hospitals , and insurance companies . For the most part , older activists believe that these interests are making astronomical profits and can afford to take a cut in income . As the Gray Panthers ' Flynn says , " The only thing the insurance industry has done is to insure well people . " The overarching belief that the health care system is flawed and that costs are out of control buoys some seniors groups in their support of Clinton 's proposed plan . Medicare funds now grow at a rate of about 11 percent a year . The president wants to curb growth to a much lower rate , maybe 4 or 5 percent , and many seniors groups are willing to play ball for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macdonald , coauthor ( with Cynthia Rich ) of Look Me in the Eye : Old Women , Aging , and Ageism ( Spinsters Ink ) , supported Bill Clinton during the campaign . " With Clinton , " she says , " you want to wait because he has vision and he has a sense of what the overall needs are . " Older voters saw in Clinton a willingness to change and an energy that was missing under Reagan and Bush . But now that same energy , " aimed like a laser " on cutting costs , is threatening , and many seniors are treading lightly as Clinton unveils his new health care program . " Older people are very uneasy about fighting with the younger generation , " Macdonald says , " until it is very clear what the issue is going to be . " In Washington , D.C. , the lobbyists have been slow to come out against the $124 billion in additional Medicare cuts . There 's talk around Capitol Hill that seniors groups did n't fight hard enough to stop the initial $56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their poorer constituents down because they did n't emphasize that the people who can not afford to pay more  --  a disproportionate number of whom are women  --  are in fact going to have to pay more . Seniors , for the most part , favor universal health insurance coverage , and they are willing to make some sacrifices so they wo n't be perceived as a burden on the younger population . " The old do not want to be a stumbling block to prevent a national single-payer system , " says Macdonald . " They 're looking at the common good , but when it comes down to the line , believe me , you 'll hear from them . " Former New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug thinks it 's not a moment too soon for seniors organizations to start raising their voices . She warns that they are " making a big mistake " by not fighting the proposed cuts . " They 've got themselves in a bind , " she says . " They settled for less " when they accepted the $56 billion cut without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that if any more is cut there is no guarantee that Clinton will be able to live up to his promises to provide long-term care and prescription drug benefits . Instead , older people may find that there is not enough money in Medicare to cover their needs and there will be a disincentive for doctors to treat them . The angriest voices coming from the current Congress are those of two Democrats from California , Henry Waxman and Pete Stark , who agree that seniors will suffer under the cuts . If the president succeeds in curbing the growth of Medicare , older people could ultimately benefit , but only if the savings are passed on to them through lowering both their Medicare premiums and their payments . Clinton is also promising to use some of the program 's estimated savings for prescription drug plans and long-term benefits that are not now covered under Medicare . But there is a downside . And a risk . Older persons could be hoping for savings that will never be realized . All the costs are projections , and how the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year is unknown . Seniors could also be supporting a plan that will discriminate against them in the long run . If , for example , the package puts a cap on the amount a doctor or hospital can charge a Medicare patient but does not put the same restriction on the rest of the population , doctors and hospitals might decide it 's not worth it to treat Medicare recipients . " Older people are often more complicated to treat because they have multiple conditions , " says Marilyn Moon , a health economist at the Urban Institute , a think tank in Washington , D.C. If doctors are forced to charge $20 , say , for an 80-year-old woman who needs to spend 30 minutes with the doctor , as opposed to $30 for a 20-year-old who needs ten minutes with the doctor , they might be less likely to accept the older patient . Hospitals would also be getting paid less . Roughly 40 percent of the patients at St. Joseph 's Mercy Hospital in Mount Clemens , Michigan , are on Medicare . The hospital now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat patients , according to Karen Ehrat , the chief operating officer . Further reductions mean the hospital will begin to scale back its services to Medicare patients . With all this controversy over Medicare , why not just dismantle it and let Clinton 's health care reforms care for the old ? Dan Schulder of the National Council for Senior Citizens doubts that Medicare can stand alone as a separate system , as planned , once the reform package takes hold : " There will be inevitable table conflicts in payment and quality standards between the two systems to the detriment of older persons . " Meanwhile , seniors are caught in a bad position . If there is no health care reform , they lose . Prices will definitely continue to skyrocket , and any illness that strikes women like Julia Malberg and Ruth Hodge will drown them in bills they ca n't pay . Yet if the reform package passes without clear financial protection for Medicare recipients who are in great need , then they also lose . The special interests have already begun to fight : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to lower their profit margins . The tobacco and alcohol industries are fighting sin taxes . Some small business owners do n't want to pick up more medical tabs , and lawyers do n't want malpractice fees capped . The older persons ' lobby , which is considered powerful and effective in Washington , ca n't afford to remain silent . The risks are too great .
