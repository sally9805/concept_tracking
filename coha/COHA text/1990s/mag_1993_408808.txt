Everybody 's doin ' it , doin ' it , doin ' it . Business process reengineering is the hottest trend in management . The mint should coin money as fast as the consulting firms that peddle reengineering , several of which publish glossy magazines about their work and charge up to $2,500 for admission to conferences that double as sales pitches , with fervent testimonials by client companies . " Reengineering is new , and it has to be done , " asserts Peter F. Drucker , the most eminent of management experts . The telltales of faddishness are fluttering . Says a telephone company executive : " If you want to get something funded around here  --  anything , even a new chair for your office  --  call it reengineering on your request for expenditure . " Get ready for the backlash , right ? Wrong . Reengineering is for real . Done well , it delivers extraordinary gains in speed , productivity , and profitability . Union Carbide has used reengineering to scrape $400 million out of fixed costs in just three years . GTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases doubling revenues or halving costs . But process redesign is strong medicine , not always needed or successful , and almost always accompanied by pain  --  or at least unpleasant side effects , such as causing executives ' hair to fall out . By one estimate , between 50% and 70% of reengineering efforts fail to achieve the goals set for them . After a half decade of pioneering experience with reengineering , businesses have learned key lessons about what works and what does n't , about the most common mistakes companies make , and about what executives can do to put their efforts in the win column . Reengineering , a.k.a. process innovation and core process redesign , is the search for , and implementation of , radical change in business processes to achieve breakthrough results . Its chief tool is a clean sheet of paper . Most change efforts start with what exists and fix it up . Reengineering , adherents emphasize , is not tweaking old procedures and certainly not plain-vanilla downsizing . Nor is it a program for bottom-up continuous improvement . Reengineers start from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing methods , people , or departments . In effect they ask , " If we were a new company , how would we run this place ? " Then , with a meat ax and sandpaper , they conform the company to their vision . That 's how GTE looks at its telephone operations , which account for four-fifths of the company 's $20 billion in annual revenues . Facing new competitive threats , GTE figured it had to offer dramatically better customer service . Rather than eke out steady gains in its repair , billing , and marketing departments , the company examined its operations from the outside in . Customers , it concluded , want one-stop shopping  --  one number to fix an erratic dial tone , question a bill , sign up for call waiting , or all three , at any time of day . GTE set up its first pilot " customer care center " in Garland , Texas , late last year and began to turn vision into fact . The company started with repair clerks , whose job had been to take down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and send it on to others who tested lines and switches until they found and fixed the problem . GTE wanted that done while the customer was still on the phone  --  something that happened just once in 200 calls . The first step was to move testing and switching equipment to the desks of the repair clerks  --  now called " front-end technicians " - and train them to use it . GTE stopped measuring how fast they handled calls and instead tracked how often they cleared up a problem without passing it on . Three times out of ten now , and GTE is shooting for upward of seven . The next step was to link sales and billing with repair , which GTE is doing with a push-button phone menu that allows callers to connect directly to any service . It has given operators new software so their computers can get into databases that let the operators handle virtually any customer request . In the process , says GTE vice president Mark Feighner , " we eliminated a tremendous amount of work-in the pilots , we 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " GTE 's rewired customer-contact process  --  one of eight similar efforts at the company  --  displays most of the salient traits of reengineering : It is occurring in a dramatically altered competitive landscape ; it is a major change , with big results ; it cuts across departmental lines ; it requires hefty investment in training and information technology ; and layoffs result . Says Michael Hammer , a former professor at MIT who runs a Cambridge , Massachusetts , business education firm that bears his name : " To succeed at reengineering , you have to be a visionary , a motivator , and a leg breaker . " Hammer is reengineering 's John the Baptist , a tub-thumping preacher who does n't perform miracles himself but , through speeches and writings , prepares the way for consultants and companies that do . Reengineering the Corporation , the book he wrote with James Champy , CEO of the CSC Index consulting firm , has 250,000 copies in print and has spent eight weeks on the New York Times bestseller list . Most major consulting firms have added reengineering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group , Ernst &; Young , Gemini Consulting , and McKinsey ; firms with strong information technology backgrounds such as Andersen Consulting , CSC Index , and Symmetrix ; and the new consulting arms of IBM and Digital Equipment . Business is booming : Index says its revenues have quintupled in five years . The boldness of reengineering creates its perils and possibilities . Here is a partial list of what AT &T; Global Business Communication Systems  --  which makes PBXs , private branch exchanges installed on the customer 's premises , an operation with annual sales of $3.4 billion  --  had to do in two years as part of its reengineering effort : Rewrite job descriptions for hundreds of people , invent new recognition and reward systems , revamp the computer system , retrain massively , and make extensive changes in financial reporting , writing proposals and contracts , dealing with suppliers , manufacturing , shipping , installation , and billing . It ai n't cheap , and it ai n't easy . At Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska , where redesigning claims processing raised labor productivity 20% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew on most was courage : " It was more difficult than we ever imagined , but it was worth it . " Therein lies the most important lesson from business 's experience with reengineering : Do n't do it if you do n't have to . Says Thomas H. Davenport , head of research for Ernst &; Young : " This hammer is incredibly powerful , but you ca n't use it on everything . " Do n't reengineer your buggy whip business ; shut it . If you 're in decent shape but struggling with cost or quality problems or weak brand recognition , by all means juice up your quality program and fire your ad agency , but do n't waste money and energy on reengineering . Save reengineering for big processes that really matter , like new-product development or customer service , rather than test the technique someplace safe and insignificant . The best corporate candidates for reengineering are companies facing big shifts in the nature of competition . It has spread as fast as gossip through financial services , for example , where deregulated banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same investment dollar . Another hot spot is the vast , tumultuous field of telecommunications  --  local and long-distance phone companies , cable television providers , computer makers  --  where regulatory and technological barriers to entry have fallen precipitously . In 1988 , says Raymond W. Smith , CEO of Bell Atlantic , one of the seven regional Bell operating companies , " we looked at what happened to the airlines and the three blind mice the broadcast networks when new capacity came in . We had to reengineer . " Five years later  --  and with 20,000 fewer employees in its traditional telephone business  --  Bell Atlantic seems decidedly more competitive . For example , the company cut the time needed to hook up customers to long-distance carriers from as much as 16 days to just hours  --  and began winning back market share from " alternate-access carriers , " which had been moving in on its big corporate accounts . There are two principal reasons to reengineer : fear and greed . If you can imagine  --  or worse , see  --  that an upstart rival , unburdened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could chew up your business , or if you can see how you could do unto him , reengineering may be the ticket . " It is n't fair , " one insurance executive moaned to George B. Bennett , head of the Symmetrix consulting firm . " I 've got mainframes to run and agents to pay , and I 'm competing with little guys who just have PCs and telephones . " Precisely . All change is a struggle . Dramatic , across-the-company change is war . How can you increase the odds for success ? Here are a few more lessons from the front . * Get the strategy straight first . " Do n't fix stuff you should n't be doing in the first place , " says Robert M. Tomasko , author of a new book , Rethinking the Corporation . Take a long look at what business you want to be in and how you intend to make money at it . Union Carbide made a fundamental decision to emphasize commodity chemicals rather than specialty products . That decision dictated the company 's aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest possible manufacuturing costs and provide added value in delivery and service . Reengineering is about operations ; only strategy can tell you what operations matter . An early hero of the reengineering movement was Mutual Benefit Life . The New Jersey insurer brilliantly redesigned the way it issued and underwrote policies  --  but that did n't keep disastrous real estate and mortgage investments from forcing it to seek shelter under the protection of the New Jersey State Department of Insurance in 1991 . Says John Hagel III , a reengineering specialist at McKinsey : " We did an audit of client experiences with process reengineering . We found lots of examples where there were truly dramatic impacts on processes  --  60% to 80% reductions in cost and cycle time  --  but only very modest effects at the business-unit level , because the changes did n't matter in terms of the customer . " A computer company , convinced that customers needed more expertise from its sales force , poured tens of millions of dollars into reengineering its selling operations , training people in consultative sales techniques and outfitting them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care . What mattered to them was price . At Agway , the giant farm supply cooperative in the Northeast , two years of losses had convinced executives that the business was in trouble . Says Bruce Ruppert , senior vice president for planning and operations : " At the beginning , when we asked where Agway should go , all the top executives said different things . " Agway 's 600 stores sold everything from cattle feed to garden trowels  --  basically a retail chain backed by 18 warehouses and feed mills . That setup was out of sync with the times . One out of eight farms in the Northeast disappeared in the 1980s . The survivors  --  often big , sophisticated outfits  --  wanted more expertise than store personnel could offer . Agway shipped directly from its mills and warehouses to many farmers , but they placed their orders at the stores , resulting in a costly tangle of bills and records . Meanwhile , discount retailers like Wal-Mart had begun to siphon off general-merchandise sales from the stores , whose ability to respond was hampered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy review , Agway decided to split up its retailing and commercial farming businesses . Only then could engineering begin . Reengineering without strategy leads almost inexorably to market-blind cost cutting . It can maim the company . Says Thomas M. Hout of Boston Consulting Group : " If your only objective is cost reduction , not raising value , you will not engage the organization . People transfer out and seek shelter in a healthier division . It 's like white flight . " * Lead from the top . Reengineering is cross-functional . An insurance claim might pass through customer service , adjusting , and accounting before a check is cut . All three departments must be brought into any effort to reengineer the process  --  they all might end up being combined . Says William G. Stoddard , director of Andersen Consulting 's reengineering practice : " Departments are stovepipes . We work in sewer pipes . " That means reengineering must be led by people with the authority to oversee a process from end to end or top to bottom . Says Hammer : " The guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a lot of people are going to need to be clouted . " The ideal reengineering czar , therefore , is not a department head , staff officer , or information officer but the CEO , COO , or her equivalent at the business-unit level . The leader should create a core team of first-rate people from all relevant departments  --  the very people their bosses are most loath to spare  --  as well as senior executives from human resources and information systems . * Create a sense of urgency . Reengineering will break apart under political pressure or peter out after a few easy gains unless the case for doing it is compelling , urgent , and constantly refreshed . That is not hard for a major buyer of red ink . When the need is less clear , there is no better salesman than a customer . Hallmark Cards shattered whatever complacency resulted from its cosseting culture and seemingly unassailable market position by making a series of videotapes to show to its top 40 executives . Chiefly at issue was the company 's pokey process for bringing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly falling store traffic . Then a senior vice president of Wal-Mart , a not-insignificant customer , delivered the not-subtle message that he hoped their companies could continue to do business . Says Steve Stanton , the CSC Index consultant who had the videos made : " By the time the lights went up , the temperature in the room had fallen 20 degrees . " Fear , resistance , and cynicism are inevitable as the reengineering team begins to unearth problems and toss around radical ideas for solutions . If not team members themselves , almost certainly their bosses and peers will defend their turf or be quick to show why a new idea ca n't possibly work . To keep peace among the dukes and baronets , nothing is more critical than for the core team constantly to fill in the case for reengineering by talking to customers about their needs and learning where competitors are ahead . Says Joseph Ambrozy , Bell Atlantic 's vice president for strategic planning : " Benchmarking is essential . You must know where you stand , function by function , process by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point and power of reengineering is the clean sheet of paper with which it begins . Filling it in begins with customers : The right question is , How do they want to deal with us ? , not How do we want to deal with them ? Says Steven Patterson , Gemini Consulting 's chief reengineer : " To cross multiple boundaries in the company , you need a view of the organization that everyone agrees on but that does n't depend on today 's geography . So you start from the customer  --  then figure out how to execute the work . " That 's easier said than done , particularly as reengineering moves from design to execution , and after the easy victories have been won . Glenn Hazard , the process reengineering vice president of AT &T's; Global Business Communication Systems , says , " Designing from the outside in  --  all the way through  --  was the most critical success factor . " To make the company wear its customers ' shoes for the whole journey , Hazard 's team enlisted several customers who served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial runs , and gave regular feedback . Reengineering experts warn against spending too much time studying existing work flows  --  " the analysis tar pit , " Hammer calls it . But do n't throw out the old process map too fast . Especially if coupled with activity-based cost accounting ( FORTUNE , June 14 ) , it can identify points of leverage where new thinking will provide the biggest benefit . * Manage your consultant . You 've used consultants before . They come in , interview people , run some numbers , present their findings , and leave you with a handsome black binder . ( It 's on the shelf to your right . ) Reengineering consultants do that too , only they expect to stay around to help with implementation . Not just legions of bright young MBAs ; behind them stand cadres of techies ready to help rebuild your information systems . You need them , because implementation is the tough part . Says J. Raymond Caron , chief information officer of insurance giant Cigna , who coaches the company 's extensive reengineering effort : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights when you go home and get sick . " As reengineering is put into practice , old functional priorities ( and their Praetorian guards ) will reassert themselves : They 'll insist that you ca n't eliminate the regional sales offices , for example . An outsider can help you contain such objections . Trouble is , consultants bill by the hour . " Consultants are pushing the hell out of reengineering , " says one of their brethren , " because it sells well and it 's very labor-intensive . " Bills of a quarter million dollars a month are common . Moreover , a clean-slate philosophy , says Davenport of Ernst &; Young , " inevitably leads to multi-megabuck implementation projects . " One giant office-products company lost sight of costs while designing a splendid order-management process , richly gewgawed with technology  --  then discovered that the price for hardware , software , and training would be $1 billion . At Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska , Betty Woods instructed her consultant that each stage of reengineering had to generate enough savings to pay for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , laughing . An Andersen Consulting client announced up front : " I 'll spend as much on information technology as you save me in inventory . " Rules like these not only keep costs in line but also build enthusiasm and confidence as managers and employees nail coonskins to the wall . Most important , says Joseph Ambrozy of Bell Atlantic , ask your consultant for references , check them , and use him to train in-house experts who can carry the message deeper into the company . * Combine top-down and bottom-up initiatives . At first blush , reengineering , with its emphasis on strong leadership , technology , and radical change , seems to be the antithesis of employee involvement , Total Quality Management , and other participative schemes your people have been beavering away at . It 's true that reengineering can not be led from the bottom of an organization , because it will be blocked by organizational boundaries , like a wave dashing against a sea wall . But top-down and bottom-up change need n't conflict . In fact , says Andersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an environment of continuous improvement or TQM . " When the consultants move on and the process map comes down from the wall , the painfully won gains will leak away unless the employees who have to live with the new work design had a hand in creating it and unless the human systems of the company  --  compensation , career paths , training  --  reinforce the changes . Reengineering should not replace TQM or other initiatives . It should give them something to work on . In Union Carbide 's industrial chemicals division , plant and equipment maintenance accounted for 30% of costs , making it an obvious target for reengineering . Top management took aim at it and made broad decisions about how the new process should look  --  notably that maintenance and operating staffs would work on the same teams and against the same set of ambitious goals . But the details  --  how to set up shift 's , procedures for fixing a steam leak or cleaning a line-were developed on the floor of the pilot plant in Taft , Louisiana . Employees found savings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a nutshell , says vice president Vincent Villani , " top-down for targets , bottom-up for how to do it . " For all its macho rhetoric and technological content , reengineering in the end is like any other effort to change the way people work : Culture counts big . Change wo n't occur merely because management wills it . Says Agway 's Bruce Ruppert : " You can survive the old way . You can survive the new way . It 's the goddamn transition that 'll kill you . " When the once-clean sheet of paper is covered with boxes , lines , and arrows , the true test of leadership begins . <p>
