IN THE TONY ENCLAVE OF MORRIS TOWNSHIP , N.J. , reality is a $700,000 house perched on acres of shady lawn , and crime is a plot device in a P.D . James novel . Recently , though , the disappearance of one of Morris Township 's most respected citizens has brought in a gust of the world outside . Sidney Reso , the 57-year-old president of Exxon International , vanished , his car left idling at the end of his driveway , as he headed for work on the morning of April 29 , and no one has seen him since . <P> In the midst of an intensive police investigation , Exxon announced last week that it would offer a " substantial reward " for information leading to the executive 's safe return . There are no allegations that Reso , a stable family man who has spent holidays working behind soup-kitchen counters , is off on a scam of his own . " There 's nothing to indicate a voluntary disappearance , " said a spokeswoman in the Morris County prosecutor 's office . Law-enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Post reported that a letter claiming responsibility for Reso 's abduction had been issued by a group called the Rainbow Warriors . The name Rainbow Warrior belongs to a Greenpeace ship destroyed by the French government in 1985 . Greenpeace , an international environmental group , vehemently denies any involvement in the Reso incident . Investigators are uncertain that the note is anything other than a prank , and they are remaining tight-lipped on the details of the case .
