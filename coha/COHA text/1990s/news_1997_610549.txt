<p> " Why trees ? " <p> Ambassador George C. McGhee repeats the question thoughtfully as he strolls through the arboretum at Farmer 's Delight , the 340-acre Virginia farm he shares with his wife , Cecilia . " Trees are just one of 32 things I ecs collect , " he replies . " I 've been collecting since I was a child  --  butterflies , insects , minerals , arrowheads  --  anything that aroused my curiosity . " <p> A Renaissance man in the 20th century , McGhee 's interests are broad , diverse and inclusive . There 's very little he does n't consider worthy of collecting , and trees just happen to be among the choices that he has gathered and displayed at Farmer 's Delight , site of the couple 's 1791 home ; a 1750 barn converted into a library ; a chapel ; a garden house ; and two barns , including haylofts . <p> Minerals , seashells , prehistoric stone tools , Russian and Turkish icons , kilims , Roman , Mayan and Iranian antiquities , African and New Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquities are among his collections . Plus a goat-hair tent that took four men to carry up to the hayloft in one of the barns . The list goes on , all items McGhee has assembled in his travels in the oil business and later as a career officer in the Department of State . The trips themselves are documented in 50,000 slides . <p> Yet still he recalls the collection that got away  --  an entire village in Tuscany  --  including a charming villa  --  which was a temptation at the offering price of $ 35,000 . He settled instead for a houseful of antique Italian furniture , enough to furnish almost completely the house at Farmer 's Delight . <p> " When my father gets a notion , he goes at it thoroughly , " says Marcia Carter , one of the McGhees ' daughters , a partner in Booked Up , a rare-book store in Washington . " But you have to admire a man who starts planting slow-growing trees when he is in his sixties . " <p> Rising majestically from the ground to protect the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter winds are the trees : Thirteen shiny-leafed magnolias in a row festooned in summer with as many as 1,950 blossoms at one time ( yes , McGhee actually has counted them ) ; 1,000 North Carolina white pines whose long , spare branches sweep dramatically toward the ground ; dozens of native deciduous species clustered cozily around the house ; and an informal arboretum of 162 trees representing 122 species and their variants , nearly all of them conifers . <p> McGhee 's wife , Cecilia , shares his interest in collecting . " But , " he adds , " she does n't have a mania for it like I do . " She does have a fine collection of Wedgwood porcelain , however , and enjoys brightening her husband 's evergreens with flowering plants . <p> McGhee has had a varied and productive life since he was a boy in Dallas , combing Texas riverbeds for interesting things to bring home , identify and display in his room . A graduate of the University of Oklahoma in geology and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford in England in 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early years of his career . <p> In 1941 , having discovered a rather large oil field , he could afford to trade the oil business for the Navy and ultimately a second career in diplomacy . In the succeeding years , he served as coordinator of aid to Greece and Turkey under the Truman Doctrine , as assistant secretary of State , as ambassador to Turkey and Germany , and as Under Secretary for Political Affairs under President Kennedy . <p> Drawing on his experience in these posts , he has written nine nonfiction books , and a lively novel about the oil business called " The Dance of the Billions . " His latest book , " On the Front Line in the Cold War : An Ambassador Reports " ( Praeger ) is due to be published this year . <p> McGhee speaks nostalgically about his time in England . There he visited many of the country 's great estates surrounded by expansive parks with trees , shrubbery , garden follies and lakes ; gardens with exotic plants gathered through the centuries on far-flung travels ; manor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grand tours of the Continent ; collections of curiosities inspired by the 18th-century English passion for the natural sciences . <p> While the " Treasure Houses of England " evolved over centuries , McGhee 's own treasure house in Loudoun County is on a smaller scale . But the cultural diversity it represents is similar to those grand estates in England  --  providing his three daughters and three sons , who are now grown , and his five grandchildren a rich cultural heritage . <p> " It was very enriching living with all the things my father collected , but I was grown up before I realized everyone did n't live that way , " says Dorothy McGhee , who now lives in Shepherdstown , W. Va. , with her two children , Magnolia Niederhauser , 16 , and Mathew Niederhauser , 14 . " Rather than stuff from Sears , we had stuff from Asia Minor . " <p> Farmer 's Delight came into their lives one winter afternoon in 1948 when George McGhee was driving from Washington to Foxcroft School near Middleburg , where he , then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan . The air was fresh , and the late afternoon light slanting through the tunnel of trees overhanging the winding country road was enticing . " My line of country , " McGhee murmured , a phrase he had picked up while living in England . <p> Over dinner with " Miss Charlotte , " as Charlotte Haxall Noland , the founder and then director of Foxcroft was known , he inquired if she knew of a property in the area he and his wife might buy . She did : " Farmer 's Delight . " Cecilia McGhee came out with her husband to see the property the next day , and they bought it . <p> Both house and grounds were essentially unchanged from 1791 when they were purchased by Joseph Lane , a member of the Virginia Assembly . He named the property Farmer 's Delight and built the present house , a stately Georgian structure adjoining a two-room cabin that had been built 20 or 30 years earlier . <p> The McGhees added a two-story wing to the house , and then turned their attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared without a trace . So the McGhees hired Washington landscape architect Boris Timchenko to guide them in the placement of terraces behind the house overlooking a two-acre lake , which they also put in . Beyond the lake was a generous grove of native oaks whose profile McGhee enhanced with the addition of North Carolina white pines . <p> A second lake , of 25 acres , was added for fishing and boating . <p> They planted the terraces with 4,000 English boxwood seedlings , augmented by 3,000 American boxwood throughout the grounds . The American boxwood plants now are about 10 feet high ; the English box , however , were infected with a root fungus 15 years ago and died . Other clipped bushes now take their place . Native deciduous trees were planted around the house , and 1,000 North Carolina white pines put in wherever their imposing green presence enhanced the composition of the land . McGhee 's inspiration grew , in part , from the grand-scale landscapes designed by Capability Brown in 18th-century England . " If England is beautiful , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " <p> Almost immediately after acquiring the property , McGhee laid out his plan for the arboretum , a series of 12 circles of trees , each with a small stump at the center so the trees could be observed in seated comfort . He decided to collect conifers because their evergreen foliage could be enjoyed all year . With more than 120 varieties to choose from , the McGhees , have no shortage of greens at Christmas time . <p> " The layout is quite unique , Ambassador McGhee 's own vision , " says Christopher Sacchi , former curator of the Orlando E. White Arboretum at Blandy Farm , in Clarke County , Va. , and now director of the Arboretum at Flagstaff in Arizona . He toured the McGhee arboretum two years ago , collecting cones for the rare seeds tucked away inside them . <p> " The advantage of the circles is that by standing in the middle you can see a large number of trees at one time and appreciate the differences between them , " Sacchi continues . " The Blandy Arboretum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has things beyond their holdings , in particular his Asian hemlocks . It is a masterpiece , hidden away where very few behold it . " <p> Today the circles are complete and the trees fully grown , their branches reaching toward their neighbors and sometimes even touching them . Four trees have died , and two beautifully shaped lacebark pines from northwest China growing near the road disappeared mysteriously 12 years ago at Christmas time . The rest are enjoying the full glory of their maturity . <p> Four continents and 17 countries are represented in the arboretum ; of those native to the United States , almost all are from states other than Virginia . Most were purchased from East Coast nurseries that specialize in exotic trees , in particular the Princeton Nurseries in Princeton , N.J. , and a nursery in Kingsville , Md. , ( no longer in business ) owned by the late Henry Hohman , a man renowned for his collection of unusual plants and for his reluctance to part with them . " He was cantankerous , so I 'd try to butter him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not when I 'd say I 'd like to have that one or another , he 'd reply , ' Oh , this one 's not for sale , ' or ' I could n't let that one go . ' " Twenty-three of the conifers in McGhee 's arboretum are from the Hohman nursery . At least five of them are new cultivars that Hohman developed . <p> During his travels , McGhee made excursions to each country 's arboretums , often seeing specimens he had in his own arboretum but growing in their natural habitat . It was tempting , he recalls , to bring seedlings home , but after losing a shipment of 20 saplings assembled in England , which died while waiting to be cleared for entry into this country , he went back to buying from commercial nurseries in the United States . <p> It 's part of McGhee 's morning routine to walk in the arboretum , trimming dead branches , pulling weeds and vines away from the trees and listening to the breeze blow through their branches . " The pines make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , many of the trees drop their needles , making a brilliant , orange carpet . The common China fir sheds small branches that look like disheveled ostrich plumes strewn on the ground . Then there are the great deceivers : the dawn redwood from China whose foliage looks like fern fronds ; the common bald cypress that turns brilliant red in fall , loses its needles and spends the winter as bare as a hardwood tree . <p> With the arboretum underway , McGhee turned his attention to other aspects of the grounds . His children watched in amazement as 300 boxwood plants went into the ground in a tracery of convergent ellipses , a design of his own invention , to form a maze . All six of the McGhees ' children and their friends learned to navigate the maze ; then the five McGhee grandchildren took up the challenge . Three minutes to the center is the record , set by Magnolia when she was a child . Adults also journey to the center  --  and back  --  but with less consistent enthusiasm . " Not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they go the distance , there 's a prize waiting at the center : An urn set into the ground holds a bottle of champagne . <p> In time , a pony ring was added to Farmer 's Delight , bordered by boxwood for the protection of children and ponies . McGhee also had a 1756 log cabin moved from an early town site in Leesburg to a promontory on the lake , where the family picnics and sails . Twelve pairs of columns from a 14th-century Benedictine monastery in France , purchased at an auction of the William Randolph Hearst collection , form a colonnade to one side of Timchenko 's terraces . Honeysuckle and wisteria form a canopy between them . <p> Finally , McGhee asked Meade Palmer , a Warrenton landscape architect , to design a park . It is bordered by boxwood with cypress trees rising behind . <p> Farmer 's Delight has taken form gradually because until three years ago the McGhee family lived mainly in Washington or abroad , visiting the property on weekends and vacations . <p> But the farm was never forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes with exotic labels were delivered there , full of art and artifacts from places as disparate as Papua New Guinea , Saudi Arabia , Africa , Russia and Turkey . Sometimes packages would take six or eight months to arrive . From New Guinea alone came 650 pieces , one a lodgepole 25 feet long . The wooden packing boxes were so attractive McGhee uses them as pedestals to display other pieces . Most of the New Guinea collection now has been donated to the Smithsonian Institution . <p> As the rooms of the house became filled to capacity , McGhee converted the property 's 1750 barn into a library and work space for himself , and a place to display his collections of ancient Roman , Iranian and Mayan artifacts . <p> The elegant stone and wooden structure looks like a place that should harbor treasures . But two newer barns , also converted to display space , appear from the outside as though cows and horses might live within . When McGhee opens their double doors and turns on the lights , however , the barns explode with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rafters ; brilliant masks hung on posts stare across tables of colorful pottery , clay figures and other examples of Mexican , Peruvian and Guatemalan folk art . In the hayloft , the voluminous goat-hair tent suspended from the ceiling encloses a collection of Saudi Arabian domestic items  --  rugs , pots and household utensils . Another barn houses art and artifacts from Africa , and textiles from the Middle East , but the bulk of the African collection already has been donated to Duke University in North Carolina , and the kilims to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond . <p> The largest memento from the McGhees ' travels is a small , stone chapel with a slate roof , and a belfry with a bell that can be heard as far away as neighboring farms . He built it in a grove of towering pines that drop a carpet of bright orange needles around it in fall and winter . During the five years McGhee was ambassador to Germany , tiny St. Mary 's Chapel down the street from the ambassador 's residence cheered and comforted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day and looked for the glow of candlelight through its stained-glass windows at night . As a 53rd birthday present for her husband , Cecilia McGhee made a gift of architectural drawings of the chapel . Several years later , they had a replica built at Farmer 's Delight . The chapel went up slowly because the stonemason , a local man who had stopped by the farm to inquire about rebuilding their gateposts , had no experience building churches . <p> Now that the McGhees have retired , George McGhee no longer adds to his collections and has stopped planting trees . The time has come for the couple simply to enjoy what they have created at Farmer 's Delight . <p> Prudence Squier is a frequent contribuitor to Washington Home .
