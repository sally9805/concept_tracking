When Andrea Thaler , 46 , was wheeled into the operating room for routine gallbladder surgery five years ago , she thought she was in a safe place . But as soon as the operation began , the Nashville , Tenn. , HMO executive realized that the sedatives and pain-killers administered by her anesthesiologist had n't quite taken hold . She could feel the surgeon make six " slicing , burning " laparoscopic incisions in her abdomen , but she was trapped by the paralytic drugs given along with the anesthesia , and she could n't cry out or even open her eyes . " I was screaming in a black hole , " she recalls . " I thought I would die on the table and nobody would know what happened . " <P> Thaler was experiencing a phenomenon that anesthesiologists delicately call " awareness . " These unexpected wake-ups occur in at least 40,000 of the nation 's 20 million annual surgeries , according to Emory University anesthesiologist Peter Sebel , who has studied the problem . In most cases the pain-killers keep working , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalpel cutting and scraping . But , Sebel estimates conservatively , in at least 400 such awareness accidents , the pain breaks through the veil of drugs . It 's possible , say other experts , that the number of patients who wake up each year to excruciating pain in the middle of surgery could be in the thousands . <P> Adding insult to injury , many " survivors , " as they call themselves , report that doctors and other medical personnel routinely leer at or ridicule the inert bodies before them . Jeanette Tracy , a television producer from Dallas , suffered this when she was anesthetized for a hernia operation in 1991 . Enduring pain she describes as " a blow torch in my stomach ... every tissue tearing like a piece of paper , " she heard the anesthesiologist say she had " the right size breasts " and was in " great shape " for a mother of two . " You ca n't cover yourself , " she says furiously . " You 're screaming as loud as you can inside your head . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The humiliation is not just for women . Tracy , who went on to found a support group called AWARE ( Awareness with Anesthesia Research Foundation ) , tells of one male patient who woke up to a female nurse holding up his penis and laughing about its diminutive size . <P> For a variety of reasons , most awareness survivors never tell their anesthesiologist about the experience . One study suggests that only 35% ever say anything . But such studies are rare , and most anesthesiologists have no conception of how deeply their patients suffer . " I used to think people who talked about this topic were flakes , " admits Texas A &M; anesthesiologist Charles McLeskey , who became a believer after a patient told him what he had overheard while he was under . <P> Boston University psychiatrist Janet Osterman is having trouble recruiting survivors for a research project on awareness at Boston Medical Center because so many refuse to enter the hospital to be interviewed . Osterman says her subjects display all the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder , including flashbacks , irrational fears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to go to sleep , " she explains . " Letting go feels too much like going under anesthesia. "
