Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I 'd be able to take three trophy bucks , in three days , by three ways . The silence . It 's the first thing you notice when you hunt the Northern bush country in Canada . The snow muffles all sound . It hangs thick on the ever-green branches , bending them downward , enveloping every noise in cold cotton batten . Nothing was stirring that particular morning . I reached out and touched the tip of a snow-laden spruce bough , giving it just enough of a shake to separate the snow from the branch in a small avalanche . The clump dropped silently to the ground . As I stepped under the bough , sure now that I would n't end up with snow down my back , I felt pressure under my foot . I slowly lifted my boot back up and stepped out further . Too many times I 'd snapped a branch under the snow and frightened a big buck into flight . My legs were now scissored in an awkward stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For several minutes I waited in that position . Though my eyes told me that there was nothing ahead or beside me and the track I was following gave no indication of being any fresher than it had been , I knew enough to trust my instincts . Sometimes your senses pick up on a clue so subtle that your mind fails to register the information . Perhaps it 's a flickering ear or the glint of an antler tine ; other times it 's less concrete , like the whisper of hair against a branch or the foggy hint of exhaled breath . It 's easy in the deep , impenetrable silence of the Northern timber to feel your pulse jump and breath quicken . It 's easier to believe that there 's something close . I waited . Then , suddenly , he was there , standing massively before me . The buck had risen silently from his hidden bed , his impossibly thick neck thrust high  --  defiant . As the deer had risen , so too had the rifle in my hands risen to my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scant 50 yards . Then I squeezed gently on the trigger and ended the most unusual hunting season of my life . You see , that buck was my third trophy whitetail in three days of hunting . Each was taken in the bush , and each was harvested one-on-one by a different hunting method . The first , a non-typical 5X6 from Alberta , I 'd taken while stillhunting ; the second , a massive 8X8 non-typical from Saskatchewan , I 'd taken from a tree stand ; and the third , the high-racked Saskatchewan 10-pointer just described , I 'd taken while tracking . Now , I remember finding a $20 bill once , and another time I threw double sixes on four consecutive casts of the dice , but I 've never really been lucky to speak of . My luckiest day was the day my wife agreed to marry me . And though I may never be that lucky again , never in my wildest imagination did I believe that I might take three trophy whitetail bucks in one hunting season  --  let alone in three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for five years I 'd made the pilgrimage from my home in British Columbia to Saskatchewan and Alberta to try my hand at taking the whitetail of a lifetime . Though I 'd met with some success in the past , never had I even seen more than two trophy-class animals in one season . Last year was different . My annual hunt started , as it usually did , with an all-night treacherous drive across the continental divide into Alberta . By leaving my house Saturday after work I was able to reach my destination a couple of hours northeast of Edmonton by Sunday afternoon . As expected , guide Larry Miller was waiting for me when I arrived , and just as predicted , within minutes we were in Miller 's half-ton and scouting . ( Provincial regulations prohibit Sunday hunting in the area we were in . ) Two years before , Miller had taken me on a similar tour and had pointed out two spots where he 'd said a buck might show up . The first spot had looked good , but the second had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should sit there , " Miller had said , motioning to the hopeless-looking spot . " I saw a huge set of tracks crossing there last week . " After I 'd quizzed him for a few minutes and discovered that he 'd never actually seen a buck at the spot  --  and in fact did n't even know if the buck that had made the tracks sported a large rack or a small one  --  I 'd declined his offer . " Thanks , anyway , " I 'd replied , smiling my best patronizing smile . " But I 'll take the other spot . " To make a long story short , Miller had shot a 14-pointer with a 30-inch-wide spread the next day at the spot I 'd turned down . Now when he tells me to sit at a spot , I do just that . Our scouting tour took us through some beautiful timbered country , much of it capable of hiding a fleet of Boeing 747s , let alone a whitetail buck . Eventually , though , Miller stopped the truck on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field was nestled up against a deep , forested ravine . Because it was the beginning of the third week of the hunting season , neither one of us expected to see any deer until minutes before dark ; and we did n't . " Tomorrow morning I 'm going to drop you off here in the dark and you 're going to sneak down to the ravine , " Miller told me . " At first light you 'll start stillhunting back toward the top end of the ravine , but always make sure you stay within shooting distance of the field . " He looked at me to see if I intended to protest . " I 'll see you at noon . " " Why noon ? " I asked with a frown . ( I like to be in the bush all day . ) " You 'll have your big buck by then , " he said . He smiled and waited to see if I had any comment . " That is unless , of course , you have other ideas ? " " Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake twice . Of course , that 's not to say that I believed him . I 'd never taken an Alberta buck scoring more than 140 Boone and Crockett Club points in any of the previous four seasons , and I certainly did n't believe that I would do so by noon the following day . Regardless , the graying dawn the next morning found me deep in the ravine . I was n't sure whether I would freeze to death or get lost first , but I had no doubt that stillhunting would be no easy chore . The forest floor was covered with a two-inch layer of frozen snow . It was like walking over a million cornflakes , each with its own tiny megaphone . Still , I had had success under similar conditions before . The deer had to walk through the snow , too , and when they did , they would n't be able to hear for their own noise . I knew that if I took it slow enough , there 'd be a chance . Two hours later and only a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to think that there was less of a chance than I 'd originally thought . I took a careful look around , then stooped to examine an old set of tracks . I was still looking at the tracks a minute later when a squirrel chattered just out of sight around a knob to my right . Instantly , I was alert . From where the squirrel had sounded off it would have been very difficult to see me , and I figured that if it was n't me that the squirrel was scolding , then it had to be something else just on the other side of the knob . As quietly as my frozen joints would allow , I rose high enough to see over the knob . The buck must have been aware that something was n't right , as well , because just as I was craning my neck to see over the hill , so , too , was he . As soon as we made eye-to-antler contact , he was gone . Any deer hunter knows that a running whitetail in thick timber does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to prove to be a fortuitous decision , I opted to hold my fire and instead keep my eyes peeled for glimpses of the buck as he made his way through the trees . Once out of sight , the buck angled to circle around me . Unfortunately for him , however , I had anticipated the move and was watching with my binoculars as far back into the forest as I could see . Nearly five minutes later my vigilance  --  or gamble , rather  --  paid off , and I was rewarded with the barest glimpse of antler and hide through a tiny gap in the trees far beyond where my unassisted eyes could have ever picked up movement . By kneeling down and bobbing my head around for the best view , I managed to pick out another clear channel about 100 yards ahead of where I 'd spotted the sneaking buck . Minutes later I was beginning to believe that the buck had changed course and was heading directly away , but just then the tell-tale nose and rack of the big whitetail filled the three-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the buck 's shoulder entered the gap , I squeezed a shot off . I lost the sight picture immediately , but was confident that the bullet had flown true as I made my way the 150 yards to where I 'd last seen the deer . I found the heavy-racked buck laying within yards of where he 'd been when I 'd shot . He was my first true trophy Alberta whitetail , with 11 scorable points and a field-dressed weight of nearly 220 pounds . It was 10:30 a.m . Because the limit in Alberta is one deer , I was tagged out ; so three days later I bid adieu to Miller and made my way east to Saskatchewan . I intended to hunt in the southern half of the province where the year before I had taken a tremendous 13-point buck with my muzzleloader . Unfortunately , I had to wait until the beginning of the following week to hunt , so I decided that a tour of the northern half of the province was in order in the meantime . In this area the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year . This is the region that sportsmen from the United States are limited to for deer hunting , and it is also home to some of the largest whitetails in the world . Coincidentally , the northern portion of Saskatchewan also happens to be some of the most difficult country to hunt . Almost every square mile of the region is covered with timber , swamps or lakes , and without farmland to draw the deer out , it is basically futile to try to pattern a big buck there . One advantage , however , is that with tens of thousands of square miles to get lost in , a hunter can head out for days and never see another hunter 's track . Never having had the chance , much less the reason , to bother hunting in the North Country , I must say that I was impressed . Everywhere I looked I saw deer tracks . Every road I walked down I found sign in the form of large rubs . I also found the locals more than accommodating with information , and from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American hunters who ventured into the area each year seldom went home empty-handed . I was also told about a rancher in the area who seldom denied permission to hunt . I was at his place first thing in the morning . I 'm happy to report that the locals had n't steered me wrong , and after gaining permission , I walked the perimeter of one corner of the 10-square-mile forested ranch . ( It was Sunday , which means no hunting in Saskatchewan . ) During my walk I saw several does and small bucks  --  nothing big  --  but what I did find was a spot between two small lakes that seemed to serve as a natural funnel . More importantly , I found several sets of fresh tracks belonging to at least one large buck . In principle , my plan was easy enough : All I had to do was set up my portable tree stand and wait for a big buck to show up . In practice , however , in the sub-zero temperature , pulling off the plan proved to be a real test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold ; by 11 I was positively frozen . But that did n't worry me nearly as much as how I started to feel by noon . After that I started to warm up and feel drowsy . For an instant I believed that I was suffering from hypothermia , but then I realized that snow , which had begun falling early in the morning , now covered the quilted blanket I was wrapped in like a big fluffy overcoat . Great insulation and not bad camouflage , I thought , as long as the deer did n't get suspicious of a 220-pound snowy owl sitting in a tree . Eight hours after I 'd put up my stand I saw my first deer  --  a doe . She crossed in front of me within 40 yards . Several minutes later another doe and two fawns walked by ; then a third mature doe . This last doe was constantly looking behind her as she walked . I was n't surprised when the buck appeared a short time later , his nose thrust out toward the doe and his head slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , was the buck 's size . He dwarfed the doe . And his rack ! I stopped counting typical points at 10 and started counting sticker points . At six I decided it was time to move . The buck stopped in his tracks 30 yards away when the snow that had been covering me fell to the ground with a loud oommph . And at the rifle report I had my second trophy whitetail of the season . This second buck was the largest-bodied whitetail I 've ever taken , weighing nearly 300 pounds field-dressed . The bases of his 16-point rack measured six inches in circumference . He was a real wall-hanger . I thanked the farmer as I left , respecting his wish that no hunter take more than one buck per year off his land , and the next morning stopped at another ranch house 20 miles away and received permission to hunt . Snow had continued falling until first light , and I knew that conditions would be perfect for tracking . As luck would have it , I hit fresh tracks shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me less than an hour earlier . For three more hours I followed as stealthily as I was able . The buck was obviously in full rut , his tracks veering from one side to the other as he checked out deer beds long since vacated . Eventually , he must have tired of his travels and decided to bed for a few hours . And it was at his bed , tucked into the underbrush at the top of a small knoll , that I found him , as I recounted at the beginning of this story . This last buck completed my most memorable hunting season to date , rounding out what I call my whitetail trophy triple . He weighed upward of 250 pounds on the hoof , and sported a near-perfect , 22-inch-wide 10-point rack . Only a broken brow tine kept his heavy rack from scoring well into the 150s ( by Boone and Crockett standards ) . Now , I realize that my odds of finding another $20 bill are pretty slim , and I 'll probably never roll double sixes four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the odds of either of these things happening are a whole lot better than are my chances of ever again shooting three trophy bucks , in three days , by three ways . <p>
