The old wood cabin sat alone , surrounded by trees and darkness . The shades were drawn , and a dog lay motionless on the front porch . A thin stream of smoke flowed out of the chimney and headed west , across the rural Maryland countryside toward Washington , D.C. Inside , a man sat silently in front of the fireplace , shoving stacks of paper into the hot flames . The papers were the product of months of tedious and meticulous work . Each sheet represented hour upon hour of surveillance notes , in-depth subject profiles , and maps of neighborhoods throughout the D.C. metropolitan area . He knew when the police patrolled , when the newspapers were delivered , who jogged and at what time , and most importantly , where his targets slept and what time they awoke . He and his men had stalked them for months , watching and waiting , patiently discerning which part of their daily routine could be exploited  --  and when they would be most vulnerable . His strong hands reached for the fire and stopped short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , then pulled them into tight fists . The men he had been stalking had sent him to some of the most obscure places on the face of the planet to kill people who were deemed a threat to the national security of the United States of America . He had lost track of the number of people he had killed in the service of his country . He had not intentionally blocked the tally from his mind , it was just something he had never bothered to calculate . Whatever the number was , he held no regrets for the men he had killed . They were honorless , evil psychopaths  --  killers of innocent civilians . The solitary figure sitting in frontfor the last month trying to get the votes needed to pass the budget . If the budget was defeated , their chances for reelection would be severely hampered . The count would be close , but there was a plan to make a last-minute charge . The only problem was that Garret needed the president back in his office making phone calls , not sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything at the White House , the event had started late and was now running over its original half-hour slot . Garret looked down at his watch for the tenth time in the last five minutes and decided enough was enough . Looking to his left , he glared at Ann Moncur , who was standing several feet away . Garret slid between the wall and several other White House staffers and worked his way toward Moncur . When he reached her , he pulled her back and cupped his hand over her ear . " This is the dumbest stunt you 've ever pulled . If the budget gets torpedoed tomorrow , you 're history . This circus has gone fifteen minutes over schedule . I 'm going to the Oval Office , and if he is n't there in five minutes , I 'm going to come back in here and personally throw your ass out on the street . " Moncur strained to smile and look relaxed . She glanced around the room and noticed that some of the other staffers and several members of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relieved when Garret stepped away and headed for the door . For obvious reasons , Moncur did n't care for the older , crass chief of staff . Simply put , he was a pain in the ass to work for . Michael O'Rourke walked purposefully down the hallway of the Cannon House Office Building . It was just after 9 A.M. , and the building was crowded with people . O'Rourke avoided making eye contact with anyone for fear of being stopped . He was not in a good mood . O'Rourke did n't like Washington ; in fact , it was safe to say he hated Washington . Midway down the hall , he turned into an office and closed the door behind him . Inside were five men wearing dark suits and drinking coffee . O'Rourke shot his secretary a quick glance , but before she could respond , all five men closed in on him . " Congressman O'Rourke , could I please have a moment of your time ? I just need five minutes , " pleaded the man closest to the door . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Congressman , I would like to speak to you about how the farmers in your district will be affected if you do n't vote for the president 's budget . " The thirty-two-year-old freshman congressman held up his hands . " Gentlemen , you 're wasting your time . I 've already made up my mind , and I will not be voting for the president 's budget . Now if you will kindly vacate my office , I have work to do . " The group started to protest , but O'Rourke opened the door and waved them into the hallway . All five men stumbled to grab their briefcases and then headed off dejectedly , in search of another congressman to cajole . The portly lobbyist hung back and tried to give it another shot . " Congressman , I 've talked to my people in your district , and they 've told me you have a lot of farmers waiting for the crop-failure money the president has in his budget . " The lobbyist waited for a reaction from O'Rourke but got none . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in your shoes come next election . " O'Rourke looked at the man and pointed toward the door with his thumb . " I have work to do . " With the v ote so close the lobbyist was not willing to give up easily . " Mr. O'Rourke , if you vote no on the president 's budget , the American Farmers Association will be left with no other choice than to support your opponent next year . " O'Rourke shook his head and said , " Nice try , but I 'm not running for a second term . " Waving goodbye , the young congressman grabbed the door and closed it in the lobbyist 's face . O'Rourke turned to face his secretary , Susan Chambers . Susan smiled and said , " I 'm sorry , Michael . I told them you had a full calendar , but they insisted on waiting around to see if you would fit them in . " " No apologies needed , Susan . " Michael left the main reception area and walked into his office . He set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a stack of pink messages . Yelling toward the door , he asked , " Has Tim come in yet ? " " No . " " Has he called ? " " Yes . He said that since there is n't a snowball 's chance in hell of the president taking the funding for the Rural Electrification Administration out of the budget , he 's going to get some errands done and be in around one . " Tim O'Rourke was Michael 's younger brother by two years and his chief of staff . " I 'm glad everyone is so positive around here . " Susan stood up from behind her desk and walked to the doorway of O'Rourke 's office . " Michael , we 're only being realists . I admire that you 're trying to do what 's right , but the problem is , guys like you do n't win in Washington . " " Well , thank you for your vote of confidence , Susan . " Susan looked up into O'Rourke 's bloodshot eyes . " Michael , were you out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This bachelor life is going to kill you . Why do n't you make an honest woman out of that adorable girlfriend of yours ? " O'Rourke had been hearing it from everyone lately , but he was in no position to get married . Maybe in another year ... after he got out of Washington . He looked down and sighed , " Susan , I 'm Irish , we tend to get married late in life . Besides , I 'm not so sure she 'll have me . " " That 's a lie and you know it . She adores you . Take it from a woman : I 've seen the way she looks at you with those big brown eyes . You 're the one , so do n't screw it up . There are n't too many like her out there . " Chambers slapped him in the stomach . " I hope being crowned the most eligible bachelor in Washington has n't gone to your head ! " O'Rourke frowned and shook his head . " Very funny , Susan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad you 're getting such a kick out of this , Susan . Hold all of my calls . I have an appointment at noon , and until then I do n't want to be disturbed . " " What if your grandfather or Liz calls ? " " No one , I do n't want to be disturbed . " O'Rourke shut the door and sat down behind his desk .
