Despite the protests of creationists and their intellectual allies , and such efforts as the Kansas school board 's vote last week to expunge evolution from the school curriculum , science has long taught that human beings are just another kind of animal , but most of the time this seems like a technicality . It 's not just the obvious differences  --  language , civilization , technology  --  that set us apart . Even basic biology suggests that humanity has special status . Virtually every other type of animal comes in multiple varieties : dozens of species of monkeys , antelopes , whales and hawks walk , swim or fly the earth , to say nothing of beetles , whose hundreds of thousands of species inspired biologist J.B.S. Haldane 's famous quip that God must have had " an inordinate fondness " for them . Even our closest kin , the great apes , fall into four species , divided into several subspecies . <P> But there 's now only one species of human on the planet , and in the simplified view of evolution most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few million years ago , most of us think , the half-ape known as Lucy appeared in Africa ; eventually she begat a less apelike creature , who evolved in turn into something even more humanlike . Finally , after a few more begettings , Homo sapiens appeared . Except for that odd side branch known as the Neanderthals , the path from proto-apes to modern humans is commonly seen as a succession of new and improved species taking the place of worn-out evolutionary clunkers . <P> It 's a satisfying , if slightly chauvinistic tale , but experts in human evolution have known for years that it is dead wrong . The evolution of a successful animal species almost always involves trial and error , false starts and failed experiments . " Humans are no exception to this , " says anthropologist Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City , " no matter what we like to think . " <P> True , we 're descended from a creature that split off from the apes millions of years ago . But subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Human evolution more nearly resembled an elimination tournament . At just about any given moment in prehistory , our family tree included several species of hominids  --  erect , upright-walking primates . All were competitors in an evolutionary struggle from which only one would ultimately emerge . Then came yet another flowering of species that would compete for survival . Neanderthals simply represented the most recent version of that contest . And while we 'd find it bizarre to share our world with another human species , the fact that we 've been alone since the Neanderthals vanished some 30,000 years ago is an evolutionary aberration . <P> The notion that multiple human species are the norm , not the exception , has only got stronger with a series of major scientific discoveries . Since 1994 , four new species of hominid have been added to the human family tree , with the latest announced just a few months ago . These date from 800,000 years ago all the way back to 4.4 million years B.P. ( before the present ) .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
