The inability to run has been the source of the AFC 's Super Bowl misery . The line on the Broncos is they at least have a chance to break the NFC 's 13-year stranglehold. // The AFC 's 13-game losing streak began in Super Bowl XIX lhe 49rs ran for 211 yards , the Dolphins 25 . Three San Francisco players , including quarterback Joe Montana ( 59a ) , outgained all of the Dolphins . The 49ers won , 38-16 . Yeah , sure . Zim , Stinky , Nails , Grouchy , T-Bone and Grif-these are the guys who will erase 13 years of misery for the AFC this Sunday ? A 36-year-old tackle with bad shoulders who came out of retirement two games into the season . An almost 32-year-old guard who has endured 20 operations . A 33-year-old guard who came into the league as a defensive lineman . A 26-year-old center who once was on the Broncos ' practice squad . A 31-year-old tackle who wears peach suits , for God 's sake . A 30-yearold fullback who once was deemed unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will neutralize Gilbert Brown and frustrate Reggie White and open enough holes for Terrell Davis-a 1995 sixth-round pick , remember-to give John Elway a Super Bowl ring on his fourth try ? But why not ? Over the last 13 years of championship embarrassment , the best and the brightest of the AFC has been mutilated and shredded by the NFC , so maybe placing the fate of the conference in the hands of this ragtag bunch of mostly aging offensive linemen and a running back every other team in the league passed on through five rounds can make a difference . Certainly , Mike Shanahan is right when he says the Broncos must run , often and successfully . The best defense against Brett Favre is a methodical , efficient , clock-devouring , touchdown-scoring offense that works only if the rushing schemes function at a high level . Just as the Denver running game worked so nicely during the regular season-Davis finished second to Barry Sanders with 1,750 yards-and , perhaps more important , during the playoffs , where the Broncos have averaged 189.7 yards in three games , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the Steelers , No. 1 in the league against the rush , gave up 150 yards to Denver 's No. 1 offense , the first time in 19 games Pittsburgh had allowed more than 100 . Davis easily represents the most dangerous back , replacing Thurman Thomas , to oppose the NFC in the Super Bowl since the start of the losing streak . Thomas , by the way , is the only AFC runner to gain more than 100 yards in this dismal span . So , for a change , this seems like the real running deal for the AFC . Zim , Stinky and the lads have changed everything for Elway , giving him the most balanced offense of his 15-year career , giving teams something to worry about first before they focus their defensive plans on him , giving him realistic hope that maybe this time will be different than the previous three . " I 'd at least like to have a 60-minute game , " he says , acknowledging that his three previous Super Bowl appearances were decided by halftime . Davis and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they do , maybe they even have a chance to win . In games No. 2 and 3 of the streak , the Bears and the Giants combined to run for 303 yards , the Patriots and Broncos 59 , including 52 by Denver . New England 's seven pathetic yards is a Super Bowl record . The next year , the Broncos managed 97 yards but Redskins halfback Tim Smith gained 204 , a Super Bowl record . These are men to whom all of the AFC should be directing their prayers these days . These are the guys who , until the past week , had cut themselves off from a public dialogue the last two seasons by boycotting the media . These are the guys who defy the growing trend in the league by not growing too big ( this is the only line in the NFL without at least one 300-pound player ) . These are the guys who routinely arrive an hour early for morning meetings so they can watch extra videotape together , who eat meals together , who dress together in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably , who even belch together . These are the guys who are coached by the fanatical Alex Gibbs , a whirlwind of intelligence , belligerence and single-mindedness , who is way too smart to play sophomoric mind games but does anyway . Gibbs is Shanahan 's best friend in coaching ; he also has been employed by every AFC West team except Seattle , including an earlier term in Denver . His lines have been good at every stop ; this one is exceptional because of its experience ( a combined 45 NFL seasons ) , its intelligence and his wisdom . These are the men who play a simple but effective style ; they specialize in zone blocking , a powerful , physical approach that concentrates on execution rather than trickery . These , then , are guys who need an introduction because they 've worked so hard to remain foolishly anonymous : Gary ( Zim ) Zimmerman , left tackle , 6-6 , 294 , 12th year in the NFL . The only real pedigree of this group of free agents and low-round choices , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt to Minnesota . He played two years in the USFL , then seven with the Vikings before a threatened retirement forced a trade to Denver in 1993 . A singleminded individualist who overcame his fear of flying by becoming a pilot , he retreats in the offseason to Bend , Ore. , where he hunts , fishes and limits his contact with society . A long conversation with him consists of " Hello . " He once played a game in which he could move only one arm , yet did n't allow a sack . He endured the 1996 season with two damaged shoulders and then retired , only to return two weeks into this season after gentle prodding by Shanahan . Bills end Bruce Smith calls this highly skilled technician , a seven-time Pro Bowl selection , one of the three best who have tried to block him . Tony ( T-Bone ) Jones , right tackle , 6-5 , 295 , 10th year . He was acquired from the Ravens in an offseason trade to play Zimmerman 's left tackle spot When Zimmerman unretired , Jones moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has performed admirably . Powerful and physical , Jones rarely makes mistakes . During a 1995 operation , his heart stopped momentarily from an allergic reaction to the anesthesia . He 's a stylish dresser , with closets full of colorful suits and matching shoes , and he craves the spotlight . " I 'm flamboyant and cocky , " he says . He has a tattoo on his arm showing a bulldog eating a bone-a T-bone , presumably . Jones , who was signed by the Browns as an undrafted rookie in 1988 , was traded by the Ravens so Jonathan Ogden could play left tackle . Photograph // Mark ( Stinky ) Schlereth , left guard , 6-3 , 287 , ninth year . Schlereth 's 20th operation came during this season . He had back surgery to repair disk problems and was supposed to miss eight weeks but played after five . A one-time Pro Bowl player with the Redskins , he was a 1989 lOth-round pick . Teammates call him Stinky-Schlereth is a native Alaskan and the nickname reflects the habit of Eskimos eating stinkheads , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based as it is on power and strength now that his mobility is limited from knee surgeries . Pleasant and gracious , he turned in a near all-pro effort this season . Brian Habib , right guard , 6-7 , 293 , lOth season . Call him Grouchy . It does n't take much for him to complain about anything-and if you want an opinion about the state of the world , ask him . Hell have a thought or three . He ca n't stand dirt ; he regularly hoses down the outside of his house , takes three hours to wash his car , touches up paint after his children go to bed and vacuums his car floor mats daily . The Vikings selected him in the lOth round of the 1988 draft as a defensive lineman , but he survived the cut only by agreeing to move to offense . He is the least effective of the starters , and the Broncos make sure their scheme does n't expose him to defensive exploitation . Habib , Schlereth and Zimmerman all were fined $5,000 each by the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Chiefs . Tom ( Nails ) Nale center , 6-2 , 286 , fourth year . The Broncos thought he was a Pro Bowl player last season ; he made it this time around . A seventh-round pick in 1994 , the 218th player taken in a 222-player draft , he was cut as a rookie , then re-signed and fought his way up from the practice squad to start one game that season-at left guard . No wonder he vomits before every contest . Or maybe that is a reaction to the odor from his practice uniform , which is not washed the entire season . Tenacious and feisty , he can recover quickly from mistakes and make instant adjustments . He does the line calls , a tough burden for someone surrounded by veterans , whom he calls dinosaurs . Next to Zimmerman the quietest starter , he once sent tapes to his boyhood friends in Massachusetts to prove he was an NFL first-stringer .

We 're naming him as an extra offensive lineman , considering his heavy blocking duties . The Broncos signed him as a free agent in the offseason from Carolina to replace Aaron Craver , who moved to the Chargers . Shanahan wanted a bigger , more physical fullback , and Griffith has filled those needs . A 1991 ninth-round pick of the Colts , he was cut in training camp and did n't get into a regular-season NFL game until 1993 , blocking for the Rams ' Jerome Bettis . If he has three carries a game , he suspects a miscommunication between Elway and the Broncos ' playcallers . Thoughtful and friendly , he has become good buddies with Davis , whose ability to read and make cuts off of Griffith 's blocks increased his success this season . Alex Gibbs , offensive line coach , 5-9 , 175 , 14th NFL year . He flourishes on three hours of sleep a night and a high-energy approach to coaching . Well-read and incredibly intelligenthe once studied pre-law and holds a master 's degree in European history from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detail and technique is all-consuming . " He is nuts , " Schlereth says , " he really is . He 's going 100 miles an hour , screaming , yelling , cussing . He might be a little bit crazy , but he is a great coach . He can be a weasel and a jerk and a little general and all of the above , but you know he cares about you and wants us to be the best we can be . ' In the 13 losses , only once has the AFC outrushed the NFC In Super Bowl XXX , Pittsburgh gained 103 yards , Dallas 56 . The Broncos have averaged 71 yards in three defeats . Bobby Humphrey , twice a 1,000-yard rusher , managed 61 in one game . Elway ( 27 yards ) was the Broncos ' leading rusher in Super Bowl XXI In those 13 games , the NFC has averaged 148 yards on the ground , the AFC 74 . Let 's classify the Broncos ' rushing game as " downhill . " That is how Davis runs He rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feels it is more important to gain positive yards than to be twirling around in the backfield trying to break a big one . So Shanahan and Gibbs have moved away from the finesse and trickery of the 49ers ' ground game , which Shanahan directed for three years as offensive coordinator , and have installed a more direct approach . The Broncos push and push and push on rushing plays , using the line 's quickness and power to carve openings for the fast-striking Davis , giving him creases for his cut-back skills . Photograph GROUCHY MARKS : It does n't take much prodding to get Habib to complain about something . // Davis helps because he hardly ever is tackled without reinforcements . He turns what should be 2yard gains into 4-yard results with his tackle-breaking ability . The Packers ' defensive front will have to be as physical as the Broncos are on offense and provide able tackling . The Packers also will bring up an eighth man frequently near the line to try to occupy Griffith 's blocking and leave Davis exposed " They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do it real well , " Steelers nose tackle Joel Steed says of the Broncos . " You have to be prepared to battle them on every play and you have to tackle real well . They 've got good quickness along the line and they are smart . Those guys have been around for a long time . They know how to play . " Indeed , Seahawks defensive line coach Tommy Brasher , who schemed against Denver twice this season , believes the Broncos ' line " is much better than anything Green Bay has played . They wo n't run at Gilbert Brown , but I do n't see ( defensive tackle ) Santana Dotson being a problem for them . To think you are going to stuff the Denver running game is wrong . As long as they stay close , they will keep running the ball . Mike is committed to that ; it 's their approach . Run Davis 30 or 35 times and wear you down , and by the fourth quarter , those 4-yard gains become 12 or 15 or more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it wo n't matter . They will keep plugging . Even if they get stopped on first down , they will run it on second . " Brasher says a realistic goal for the Packers is to hold Davis to 120 yards and , on average , 4 yards or less a carry . Bill Walsh says he would n't be shocked if Davis gains 150 yards , even against a Packers defense designed to stop the run first . Yet both men are n't sure whether even a huge day from the Broncos ' running game will be enough to subdue the Packers . Still , springing Davis for at least 100 yards is the only realistic chance Zim and his gang have of winning a Super Bowl for themselves and Elway . Anything less will result in the same old mess for the AFC . " Even blockers like us are smart enough to figure that out , " Griffith says.sDI Sidebar OPEN MARKET Davis followed the blocking of Griffith and the Broncos ' linemen to 1,750 yards this season .
