// Computer viruses are everywhere . Here 's how to keep your computer from " catching a cold , " and what to do if it does . What strikes fear into the hearts of computer users more than a hard-drive meltdown ? Try the words " computer virus . " From small annoyances such as unwanted screen messages to the unbearable threat of a total system crash , these unsavory viruses easily can bring a host of costly problems . Recently , new computer viruses have been appearing daily , and with Internet usage increasing exponentially they are spreading like an oil spill . In fact , because online usage has jumped dramatically in the past few years , it 's now estimated to be about 20 times more likely for the average user 's computer to contract a virus . Likewise , experts claim that as many as 500 new viruses are introduced into cyberspace each month . Scary stuff . There 's no question that every computer user should have some sort of virus scanning software-programs that can help prevent your computer from contracting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moving Past Swapping Floppies Contracting a virus can be simple . It 's all a matter of introducing an infected file onto your computer system . And today , more types of files can be infected than ever before . Originally , a computer could only contract a virus by running infected executable computer code . In the early days of online computing , the sadistic hackers who originated viruses would often disguise their creations as legitimate shareware programs and post them in cyberspace for the whole world to consume . Back then , it was widely held that you could n't contract a computer virus simply by opening a regular file . Then along came Microsoft Word and Excel . As an intended enhancement to these two products , Microsoft added the ability to embed macros-little automated routinesdirectly into Word and Excel documents . A macro is nothing more than a miniature application program . On the upside , some macros make it easy to exchange a Word file or Excel file with someone else and have the document function identically on the other person 's computer . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-tech vandals figured out how to create macro viruses . Now you really could contract a computer virus by just opening a document , wreaking havoc on other Word and Excel files . Another urban myth busted : Despite rumors , you ca n't contract a virus by simply opening an e-mail message ( though you 're still vulnerable when you open an attachment to an e-mail message ) . Internet warnings that viruses can be contracted by reading e-mail have been circulating for some time now and have given rise to a category of mischief known as the hoax virus-a dire warning about something that does n't really exist . One of our favorite archives of high-tech urban legends is located on the Internet at www.kumite.com/myths . So what 's the good word ? Many companies offer the tools you need to protect yourself and your computer-and most cost only $40 to $50 . What 's The Difference ? All the major players in the virus protection arena do a fine job of eliminating computer viruses . The main differences lie in their various interface features and update/upgrade options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference , differences in update/upgrade options can determine the value of a given package . What 's the difference between an update and an upgrade ? Virtually all virus scanners use some sort of virus definition database to check your files against known computer viruses . As new viruses are released , the virus database on your computer can become outdated quickly . You ca n't simply install a virus scanner and expect it to protect you forever-you need to update the database regularly . Before you choose a package , be sure to consider where you get the update and how much it costs . By contrast , the term " upgrade " refers to modifications and enhancements to the actual application software . If a whole new class of virus is invented , you may need a product upgrade to deal with it . McAfee VirusScan McAfee is a widely recognized name in virus protection . Because McAfee merged with three other companies , McAfee VirusScan is now a product of Network Associates Inc . The company offers a single package that includes VirusScan for Windows 95 , Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a separate package for the Macintosh operating system . The PC Package includes the DOS and Windows versions on diskette , just in case you do n't have a CD-ROM drive . McAfee has done an excellent job of providing users with interfaces that feel right for each system . On the Windows 95 version , for example , the VirusScan interface has the general look and feel of Windows Explorer . The Mac version uses a completely different interface that makes Macintosh users feel at home . All versions provide you with complete control over when and which files are scanned for viruses . VirusScan offers tremendous value in terms of product updates and upgrades . Unlike some other vendors , McAfee offers virus definition updates free to registered users for the life of the product . These updates are available online from the Network Associates Web i site , on CompuServe ( GO MCAFEE ) , on America Online ( keyword MCAFEE ) , and even from a direct-dial BBS system ( 408/988-4004 ) . Furthermore , McAfee offers free product upgrades to newer software versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrades are especially easy for Windows 95 users . Through a service called SecureCast , you can click a button in VirusScan and have the program automatically updated over the Internet . If you find even that to be too much work , you can configure SecureCast to use " push " technology to update your software over the Internet periodically without any additional prompting . If you are using Windows 98 and get the Windows 98 Plus ! Package , aside from some additional desktop themes and games , you 'll find McAfee 's VirusScan on the Plus ! CD . But you get only six months of free updates . Two From Symantec Symantec produces two different virus scanners . Norton AntiVirus ships with Windows and DOS versions ( but no OS/2 version ) on a single CD . For Macintosh users , the company offers SAM ( Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh ) , the most popular virus scanner for the Macintosh platform . One interesting feature of Norton AntiVirus is that it gives you the option of installing an AntiVirus browser plug-in if you 're using Netscape Navigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This plug-in automatically scans files as they are downloaded via your Web browser , providing an added measure of security as you surf the Web . Like the McAfee product , Norton AntiVirus provides one-click access to online virus definition updates , through a feature called LiveUpdate . Although Symantec has long offered these updates for free during the life of the product , the company recently announced that it is converting to a fee-based subscription for updates . Under the revised policy , users will receive free updates for one year , and then be required to pay $3.95 per year for further updates . The reason , according to Symantec , is that increased virus activity is prompting the company to begin publishing updates on a weekly rather than monthly basis . The subscription fee is designed to offset Symantec 's extra costs . Although SAM does not include a browser plug-in , it still offers added Internet protection through a feature called SafeZones . Using this feature , you identify SafeZones folders on your Macintosh , where you plan to download files from the Internet . Each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a SafeZone , SAM automatically scans that file for viruses . SAM also offers single-click access to virus definition updates . However , instead of using the Internet , SAM uses your modem to dial directly into Symantec for the updates . Updates via the Internet are available , but you need to visit the Symantec Web site and download the new definition files manually . Photograph Photograph // Quarterdeck 's Extra Strength ViruSweep Quarterdeck , a company well known in the PC utilities arena , checks in with Extra Strength ViruSweep , a Windows 95-only package . At about $70 , this is the most expensive package reviewed here . ( A " regular-strength " package in the $40 range is also available . ) If you spend a lot of time on the Internet , you may find the features in Extra Strength ViruSweep worth the extra dollars . This is the only package reviewed here that claims full protection against what Quarterdeck calls vandals , which include malicious Java applets and ActiveX controls downloaded over the Internet . This added measure of Internet security is provided through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applets , ActiveX controls and other Webpage programs are downloaded into your computer , eSafe Protect puts them under Total Sandbox Quarantine . The eSafe Protect software then analyzes each element and places it in its own Sandbox-an area on your hard drive where the element is " approved " to operate . Extra Strength ViruSweep continues to monitor each element and alerts you to any activity that the element attempts outside of its own Sandbox . You then are asked to approve or disallow this activity . Using the eSafe Protect technology , you also can set up communications filters , which allow you to establish individual controls for the various communications ports on your computer , and create lists of banned IP addresses from which you would n't download data . Photograph // Extra Strength ViruSweep offers free updates from the company 's Web site . Dr. Solomon 's Duo Dr. Solomon 's Software , recently acquired by Data-Fellows , offers a pair of virus scanners : Dr. Solomon 's Anti-Virus Deluxe for Windows 95/NT and Dr. Solomon 's Virex for the Macintosh OS . Both products offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to offer the best technology for scanning compressed files . The program can actually scan for viruses inside multilayered archives in zip , lzh , arj , arc , and a variety of other compression formats . The program also boasts superior protection against what it calls polymorphic viruses-those that look a bit different in each infected file and are therefore more difficult to match to a virus definition database . Photograph // Similar to its Windows brother , Dr. Solomon 's Virex can scan compressed files using all the major Mac compression schemes ( Stuffit , Disk Doubler , Compactor Pro , etc. ) , as well as zip files . Plus , you can have the program scan all files downloaded from the Internet , so you do n't have to set up special folders , as you do with Symantec 's SAM . Finally , Dr. Solomon 's Virex is OS 8compatible : The program will even add a Scan with Virex option to OS 8 's contextual menus . Both programs weigh in at the higher end pricewise-about $60 for Dr. Solomon 's Anti-Virus Deluxe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free automatic updates . The Rest There are a number of other virus protection packages on the market . Among the more popular are Dr. Solomon 's Anti-Virus ( the nondeluxe version ) and PC-cillin , from TouchStone Software . Quarterdeck also includes a limited virus scanner in its Extra Strength RealHelp suite of diagnostic utilities . Before you invest in any antivirus software , we strongly suggest you check the vendor 's Web site for information on virus definition updates . First , make sure that the updates are current . If the latest viruses are n't included , no virus scanner can be of full use . Perhaps just as important , find out if you 'll be charged for updates . Fee structures can vary widely from vendor to vendor . For example , although Dr. Solomon 's offers free updates for its deluxe package , the company charges an annual subscription fee of $29.95 for virus definition updates to its less expensive standard package . An Ounce Of Prevention Remember , virus protection software should never be your first line of defense against infection . Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you can download from any online source , no matter how suspect it seems . The best advice is to download files from established Internet sites . You can also download with relative confidence from major corporate sites . Although it 's very important to have virus protection software on your computer , if you 're careful in your online and offline endeavors , it should n't have to do much work .
