In those days , this was how you got to my place : Down from Ruidoso and Ski Apache , you took U.S. 70 ( yes , the very route Billy the Kid , notorious bandito and youngster , hightailed horse-style to freedom in olden times ) through Tularosa , past Ray 's Tire and Lube and the C &; C Restaurant and Lounge , into Alamogordo ( " Sunbird Capital of the World " ) to the 54 cutoff where Wal-Mart Discount City meets ShowBizz Video and Big Jack 's RV . Coming from the west  --  say , for argument 's sake , you were over in Las Cruces , shaking your booty at El Patio or goofing on the cholos creeping their low-riders up Solano Street  --  you zoom through the Missile Range , past White Sands ( the National Monument , bro ) and Holloman Air Force Base . Keep an eye peeled for the Taiwan Kitchen and Guy 's Transmission . You spot Lester 's Satellite Inn , you 've gone too far . <p> From El Paso , which is how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole other story : up 54 , dead through the heart of the Ft .

About halfway up  --  it 's eighty-three miles of scrub and chamisa and creosote and snakeweed and gnarled-up yuccas and , like set decoration from the cruel genius of Rod Serling himself , ugly mountains left and right of you across a desert flat and hostile and trackless as a nightmare  --  you wheeze into Oro Grande . Take a breather , compadres . Stop in at Dyson 's Auction Barn , holler howdy or the like . If it 's summer  --  shitfire , it 's almost always summer thereabouts  --  pray to whatever beasts and gods you fear . Make an offering , neighbor . Write a last will and testament . Check your hoses and belts , tire pressure , your capacity for self-denial . Call your blood relations . Reconcile yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sunscreen , then vamoose . Look for the Oro Grande National Forest on one side of the road . It 's a single tree  --  a Chinese elm , maybe  --  as angry-looking as you would be were you lonely and windswept and ill-tended and bug-ravaged and laughed at for a lifetime . <p> An hour passes , you 're almost at my place . You see O'Brien 's Dog Ranch ( imagine the hellhounds they breed out there  --  bald , probably , plus drooly and big as ninth-graders ) . Next is Alamo Transit Mix . You see Southend Road  --  this section of U.S. highway , two miles of blacktop and beer cans , is brought to you by the Hyper Hub Club  --  then Sunrise Doughnuts and the Golden Spur . Go as far as the Hi-D-Ho Drive Inn  --  no way am I making this up ; we 're talking corny here , not to mention trite , grim , imprecise , and dopey .

Did n't honk . Did n't wave . Did n't flip me the bird . And now here I wait , a half-mile south of you , standing on the two or three blades of Bermuda I tend , wearing dress sandals and my go-to-meeting Hanes T-shirt , the prime of my youth , brown as a creature out of Palestine , and utterly , unspeakably , inconceivably sore-hearted because once again , in a manner mysterious as the twentieth century itself , I have been overlooked . Ignored . **26;444;TOOLONG . <p> How I came to be there in 1981 is , like the scorched geography itself , another circumstance worth a boo-hoo or two , so let 's stipulate the following : Say you 're a student  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no magna come louder to be sure , but a fifth-quarter junior Lamda Chi , eyeballing veterinary medicine , the USMC or rock ' n ' roll star as career options . Say , according to the minor characters your life needs in order to be the adventure it is , that you 're a " poophead " ( your last girlfriend , an oily-jointed knockout named Nikki ) , a " slugabed " ( your mother , Beverly , the Mighty Mouse of domestic engineering ) , or a " rounder " ( your dad , Martin Hidey , Esq. , attorney at law ) . Say you got all your fingers and toes , can snort Budweiser through your beezer , and recognize  --  so you think  --  the vast whatnot our to-and-fro has made of modern times . Suppose , moreover , that you 're a standard issue ectomorph who more or less believes in life after death and the one shooter theory vis-a-vis JFK . Suppose X , suppose Y , suppose the whole damn alphabet , and when you 're done with that  --  when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat on his hairless heinie has come vividly to mind  --  then suppose this pile of cow flop : Comes a day , lo and verily , in the middle of English 563 , Recent American Fiction , about page 68 of whatever helpful hogwash one talented typist has let spill from the yap of a dippy protagonist you 've been told to root for , when you announce , in a voice like hail on a tin roof , " Christ Almighty , what am I doing here ? " After that , Mister and Mrs. America , it 's a stroll in high cotton . You rise , imperious as Caeser himself , leave the books behind , bid adieu to aghast Buckeyes near and far , dean out your cave at the frat house , stow the bong , and take up residence in the basement room of your old man 's house on Stratford Street . Do n't move for five months , fatten up like a swamp frog . Grow the beard you 'd find on sixty percent of Pegleg 's swabbies . Attend to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil Donahue . Piss into the wind . Look a gift horse in the yarbles . Wish upon a star . And then  --  drumroll , Ringo  --  say " yup " when Papa Bear , steamed as the Lord Humongous , suggests you might be better off were you , well , elsewhere . With your uncle Hal , for example . In the mountain time zone , mayhaps . The Great Southwest , in particular . The Land o ' Enchantment . <p> Which is how this sorry specimen came to be as he was where he was when he met C-Dog : Simpson and thereafter came to know , as surely as Laurel follows Hardy , shit from Shinola . <p> C-Dog looked like a man with three things on his mind , two of them involving money , or disease . That 's what I was thinking that day he rumbled into my yard . I 'd been watching The Flintstones , lusting unkindly for Betty Rubble , and keeping an ice pack on an eye that seemed to have turned black subsequent to a disagreement the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequented Mondays and Thursdays . This must 've been a Friday , I 'm guessing . Late afternoon . The day like an oven on broil  --  another day from the less gladsome verses of the Old Testament . And me with a visitor in a vintage Chrysler Imperial . That 's when I had my insight . Little did I , and so forth . <p> " Hey in there , " he called , and I , thus beckoned and always curious about the foolish among us , moseyed forth , <p> He had red hair  --  rusty , actually . About the same rubbed-out , sun-faded color as the old Triumph sports car he was pointing to . <p> " This yours ? " he asked , a second instance of snappy dialogue . <p> " Nope I said , reasonable-like in spite of a hangover that Guinness might have wanted to hear about . <p> What with his posture and such , I had him made as a senior flyboy out at Holloman . Maybe that self-same sumbitch who , by dawn 's early light , buzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas-style horse owner from the Downs up at Ruidoso . <p> " What about this ? " he said , indicating what lay around and about . <p> I studied what I was the sullen caretaker of : pallets of slump block , stock tanks , ATVs and brush hogs , a backhoe with a safety cage , a gooseneck hay trailer , PVC in quantity , John Deere 's idea of a home-style tractor mower , a couple of generators  --  well , you get the picture : pre-abused manufactured items , all of which , given enough grease and greenbacks and cusswords , might in fact one day work . <p> " Hal 's , " I told him . <p> He nodded , doing something Dennis Hopperish with his lips . <p> " My uncle , " I said . " He 's the broker , " I added , using the word I 'd been told to . " I 'm the help . " <p> He was sitting in the Triumph now . Flyboy , definitely . Had that sassy cockpit manner about him . Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on his trigger finger . <p> " So where can I find Hal ? " he asked . <p> In town , I told him . Did he know the Si Senor restaurant ? <p> " On Tenth ? " he said . <p> It was my turn to nod now . Next to the Happy Booker , I told him . Could n't miss it . I had a girlfriend worked there . Mona . Mona Elena Fernandez . Ummmm-doggy . <p> " Got the trots there once , " he was saying , heaving himself out of the Triumph . " The combo plate , I believe <p> He seemed to be expecting an apology , but I , nephew and dickweed , was n't about to deliver it . <p> " He 's not my uncle , actually , " I said . " My mother 's cousin , more like it . I call him Uncle as a courtesy . He 's Arab , we think . He 's got a green card  --  " <p> Like a farmer in a field , he was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cesspools ( looked like teacups from Disney 's Wonderland ) , some lawn jockeys ( many absent a hand or an arm ) , about fifty oil drums and related debris . It was my duty , so I 'd been informed my first hour on site a month before , to accompany the customer wherever . To the moon , if need be . Guy says pole , Hal had told me , you vault . So there we wandered , me and Captain Courageous . <p> " How 's the eye ? " he said . <p> I was tiptoeing through a spread of Delco , Mopar , and FoMoCo leftovers . <p> " Listen , mister , " I started , " can we do this another time ? I got places to be . " <p> In addition to being snotty , this was true : My running buddies  --  Shorty , Slim , and Whitey , none of whom were  --  aimed to drop by in , oh , six or seven hours . We planned to make the rounds , from Boot Town to Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waylaid me the evening before . <p> " You 're a friendly fellow , ai n't you ? " <p> " Say what ? " I said . That was me at my smartest back then . Amiable as a Klingon . Courteous as a cobra . <p> " All 's I 'm saying is , you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar . Get my drift ? " <p> I looked around , innocent as the Gerber baby himself . <p> " I mean , snarling and back-sassing is no way to get along in this world . You see what I 'm saying ? " <p> Sixty miles thataway from my back stoop rose the Organ Mountains , good for throwing beer bottles at when you 're otherwise inexpressive . Thisaway , across more miles of rock and reptiles big as your leg , were the Sacramentos , all purples and grays and jagged as a villain 's teeth . Another thing for tourists to gawk at . But now there was nothing to point at . Just me and the jet jockey . One of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " blow it out your ass . " <p> That 's when he popped me . <p> Point of the chin . My head snapped back . Stars commenced . Between my ears it was Independence Day  --  sparklers and sputtering pinwheels and cherry bombs  --  and from the outer darkness a chorus was heard , voices oooey-gooey and evidently cheerless . <p> went down . Not felled like a tree , but more or less melted . <p> Became , I admit , a fair-sized puddle next to his boots . <p> I came to inside , on my sofa . C-Dog , my assailant , had himself arranged right next to me , a chair I 'd once upon a time slept twenty hours in . <p> " How you feeling , boy ? " <p> I took a second , inspecting the pulp of me . Munchkins , single-minded as savages , were inside my head with air drills , ventilating . I could be a wise-ass , I thought . Or something entirely else . Plus which , I was still seeing , two of everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What 's that ? " I asked . <p> For an instant , he seemed as surprised as I to find paperwork near at hand and relevant . <p> " Randall Charles Hidey he began , " this is your miserable life I pointed to the folder , about an inch thick . <p> " That all ? " <p> " I see you 've recovered your good humor , " he said . " I like that in a citizen . " <p> He was wearing those reading glasses you see a la Ted Kennedy , half-lenses at the tip of his nose , a dandy prop for the ducking and head-shaking and tsk-tsking that TV likes to give the earnest to do . Vice principals , for instance . Or loved ones you 've busted the hearts of . <p> " Bad news ? " I asked . Feeling had returned to my extremities . I put one of them , a leg , on the floor . <p> He held up a well-manicured finger . Wiggled it slyly in my direction . <p> " Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a while . You 've had a C-Dog respect tap , is all . " <p> Maybe an hour passed that way  --  me in coffin-like repose , Rocky Marciano licking his thumb and turning the pages before him  --  the outdoors ignorant of me and my predicament . I had , of course , the usual questions . For example : Who the dickens is this guy ? And : Cripes , what a time to be unarmed in a democracy . This was , as my father used to say , a Sit-you-HAY-shun , but , owing to an ache in the jaw and gray matter gone suddenly soft as cooked cauliflower , I was unable to find my way out of it . <p> " Is it twilight , " I asked once , " or just me ? " <p> It was the aftereffect , he said . The physics of the knuckle sandwich as demonstrated by an aficionado of the sweet science . <p> " Middleweight , " I guessed . <p> " Strictly amateur , " he said . " Golden Gloves , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , as only time can when you 're being held hostage in your own castle , so before he told me about my father and Uncle Hal and the tanning he 'd been sent to administer , I filled part of it by thinking about Mona , my Si Senor sweet cheeks . I had it bad for that woman , I swear . Badder than bad . She was to me as carnage is to warmongers . Hell , some evenings <p> used to park across the street ( in that well-dinged Bel Air Uncle Hal had loaned me ) and just watch her through the windows , the six-pack on my lap my steadfast companions . Which is not to say , sad to say , that she returned my affections . To her , I was as I was to too many in yesteryear : a sourpuss weisenheimer , one hundred eighty-five pounds of attitude as foul as The Fuhrer 's . <p> " You got a soda somewheres ? " <p> C-Dog had wandered back to the kitchen , a good time for me to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , coming in to join me anew . " You got nothing but beer and Ritz crackers . " <p> " Vegetarian , " I said , as large a lie as I could muster at the moment . " Buddhist . Full prajna . " <p> " Me , too he said . " Powerhouse Tabernacle of God in Christ . Odessa chapter . " <p> I tell everybody nowadays  --  the white collars I work for at Fab 7 , the duffers I play golf with at Painted Dunes  --  that C-Dog , once you got him to take off the aviator shades , was a semi-handsome man . Had eyes blue as marbles  --  the best description I could come up with in the quarter-hour we considered each other almost knee to knee , in my living room way back when . <p> " This is how it 's gon na be he said at last . <p> I 'd wondered about that . <p> " You 're getting a spanking , " he said . <p> Imagine you 're relaxing on your porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your elbow , Wilson Pickett on the stereo , the wisteria and lilac in glorious bloom . Your wife  --  her name is Mona , by the way  --  is whipping up such edibles as are worshipped by the fatsos at Good Housekeeping , and your God-fearing children , Mary Beth and Randy , Jr. , are in their rooms doing homework of he straight-A ilk . You got your health , Savings Bonds from work , and an automobile with thirty months left on the warranty . This is Shangri-La , folks . Home of the brave as fetched up for you by Metro , Goldwyn , and Mayer in cahoots with the poets at Burma Shave . <p> Then imagine an eerie sound  --  part whoosh , part whine  --  the trees here and there twisting sideways under an enormous wind , your picket fence flung plumb out of sight . Fierce light follows , whirling spots and glares from every corner of Kingdom Come . The ground quakes , geysers erupt hither and yon , and three of your neighbors ' houses go blammo in a column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suburb , and it 's landing atop your hydrangea . That 's how I felt for an instant  --  as if R. C. Hidey had risen from idleness and was now doing hand jive with a goggle-eyed , earless Venutian midget who might vaporize North Dakota for amusement . <p> " Dumbfounded , ai n't you ? " C-Dog remarked . " Most usually are . " <p> " No shit , " I said , still my own clever self . <p> Whereupon he laid it out for me , the scenario . One supercilious ingrate , me . One hired gun , him . Ten solid whacks on my hindmost with a belt and , praise Jesus , maybe a change in the common catastrophe that was my character . <p> " A belt ? " I said . <p> He indicated his own , a hand-tooled specimen with artful Gothic lettering . <p> " What 's it say ? " I asked . <p> He stood , bade me read him from loop to loop . <p> " ' Encouragement is oxygen to the soul , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiver . " Oh , boy . " <p> " Saw it over in Jal , " he began . " An insurance company on Fir Street . Impressed me . Hope you do n't think it 's corny . " <p> I know what you 're thinking : Head for the hills tenderfoot But something strange had come over me , possibly a sense of righteousness as unbidden as are visions to the crazed or eurekas to the eggheaded , so instead of bolting for the screen door , I leaned back into the couch , crossed my legs like a banker looking at his strong box . At long last , I thought , mysteries were being revealed . Me , R. C. Hidey , was going to know stuff . <p> " My daddy and Uncle Hal , huh ? " <p> He tapped the folder solicitously . <p> " Plus your mother , " he said . " Your sister , your frat brothers , couple of teachers , even Mona Fernandez . It 's all in black and white . " <p> " What teachers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like stones in a well . <p> " Anyone else ? " <p> He shrugged , abashed . " Well , there 's Shorty , Slim , and Whitey  --  " <p> " Geez , " I remarked . <p> He seemed saddened , too . " How true . " <p> Funny what the mind turns to in moments dire or potent or providential . Mine turned to C-Dog 's shirt  --  a western affair , naturally , with pearl snaps , line drawings of buzzards and barbed wire , plus a pattern of gold and ruby and pukey green that made you dizzy to focus upon . Just about the most ill-considered outerwear ever seen on the unaddled adult . <p> " C-Dog , " I said . " That 's a nickname , right ? " <p> " Navy he told me . " Got it in the Philippines . On account of my enthusiasm That made sense . Given the givens , there did n't seem to be anything about this encounter that could n't , in this vale or its counterparts , make sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Marion , " he said . " After my mother . Middle name Gilroy , from my father . " <p> We shared a moment then , solemn as a night in church . I could hear cars on 54 going by lickety-split , occasionally a tractor-trailer bleeping something nasty through its air horn . Outside it was all sunlight and dry heat rising in waves ; inside it was semi-gloomy , a room in a haunted house , me breathing deeply but pleased my foot had stopped trembling . The last time I 'd been whipped was after I 'd fistfought Phil Trafton following orchestra practice in the fifth grade  --  laid that piss-ant out so he 'd be useless for the cello for a week . My daddy swatted me , his hand swelling up afterward like a ping-pong paddle . The next night , unaffected as a felon and as merry a soul as Old King Cole , I was peeping in Marci Hightower 's window and slicing the garden hoses of my neighbors . Incorrigible is what I was . Delinquent as the crinkly-eyed celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. C. Hidey had been heedless , so the written record put it , mindful of little but satisfying his basest appetites . <p> " Ready ? " C-Dog asked . <p> He had gloves on now  --  " For the grip he 'd say later ; " I 'm a professional "  --  and I remember staring at them with fascination . They seemed at once delicate and demonic , tender and terrifying , rare as angel 's wings . <p> " Ready , " I said . <p> You got one question , I bet : Did it hurt much ? <p> Well , do this : Go outside to your car , open the trunk , place your index finger near the lid latch , then slam that devil hard . Do n't pussyfoot . Get your weight behind it . Leap up if you have to . That 's how it hurt , for in spite of his girth , C-Dog Simpson was part Hercules , part Charles Atlas  --  as gifted with leather-lashing as Gabriel had been with horn-honking . <p> " You can cry if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his lap , boy-like , butt in the air , the only thing between me and " encouragement " a much-washed pair of BVDs . I could smell him now , Jade East or the like , a fragrance I still associate with singleness of purpose . <p> " Do n't think so , " I told him . My heart already thumping wildly , blood rushing to my lowered head , I was concentrating on his Tony Lamas , boots with sufficient sheen to see my gritted teeth in . " Get on with it . " <p> I heard his arm draw back . <p> " Suit yourself , " he said . <p> By blow three , I was in full bawl , sucking air and sniveling . Teardrops  --  genuine teardrops , big as boulders  --  were running through my eyebrows and into my hair . He let fly , belt whistling overhead , and I braced for contact , a noise which is spelled in cartoons as " thwap " It burned . Like sitting on a cigar the size of a baseball bat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interregnum , " C-Dog would say later  --  before pain , fierce as prairie fire , spread down my thighs . I tried thinking elsewise  --  of snow skiing , which I was fair at , and of ice cream , which I could eat in industrial-size quantities  --  but my brain , the loaf of it , was filled with words like " welt " and " blister " and " flayed . " <p> " Nineteen sixty-seven , " C-Dog said after swat five . " Did this to a youngster up in Corona . " <p> I could n't respond with anything but syllables with h 's and f 's throughout . <p> " Feisty boy , " C-Dog was saying . " Took a half hour to settle his hash . " <p> I 'd found a spot on the floor to concentrate on , something that had no opinion about me or the immediate drama . <p> " Turned out okay , " C-Dog said . " That boy is now Lieutenant Governor of Texas <p> Then my fanny caught fire again . And again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver City once . He 's an astronaut . You should see my scrapbook . Got me a police chief in Denver , a college dean , a couple of California movie actors . Females , too . You ever hear of Miss New Hampshire Universe 1968 ? Mother of five now . An eye doctor . " <p> At this point I was overcome by a vision : C-Dog at the wheel of his Imperial , on the highways and byways . A man , clearly , with more than a line of work . He had a calling . Wrongs to right . Justice to dispense . Half Zorro , half King Arthur . In his trunk probably a full suit of armor . A shield . A lance . A terrible , swift sword . <p> At numero ocho , he seemed to shift , his own breath ragged and short . <p> " Out "  --  he said , huffing  --  " of "  --  puffing  --  " shape . " <p> Me , I was feeling giddy , loopy and oddly good-humored as a drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong end up , mine was a world gone blue and orange , a noteworthy glow around most of my furnishings . Happily , there was less pain now . I figured my flesh was hanging off in strips , like fresh beef jerky , and C-Dog was merely exercising himself against the thin , nerveless bones of my behind . Speech had n't yet returned , but I was suffering fewer thoughts with gibberish at the core . <p> Then we were done , and I had evidently moved into the last chapter of my story , the part wherein I am face-down on my couch and Marion Gilroy Simpson , flush-faced as Porky Pig , is standing over me , his special gloves out of sight , his belt once again holding up his belly . <p> " Here , " he said . <p> Near as I could make out , he was offering me a jar of Crisco . <p> " It 's vitamin E , " he said . " Takes the sting out . Promotes healing . " <p> I nodded . I may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? " I said . <p> He grinned himself , ten thousand of the most perfect teeth in the Northern Hemisphere . <p> " Slop that stuff on as needed , " he said . " You 'll be shipshape in no time . " <p> That was nice to hear , and I said so , now in complete control of both the mind and meat of me . <p> " You hungry ? " he asked . <p> I considered it . I was . <p> " Me , " he was saying , " I always work up hunger on a mission . Got supplies in the car . " <p> That was nice , too . Hell , everything was suddenly nice  --  the weather , my situation on earth , all the peoples of the planet , even the dinner C-Dog fixed ( melted cheese , olives , tomato soup , store-bought eclairs for dessert ) , which , like a nurse or a friend from heaven , he served me bite-size . Anything seemed possible . Silk ties on herd bulls . Circus seals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been , as my kids nowadays say , morphed-changed from the inside out . Wooly-minded and agog , I felt I 'd emerged from a virtually sleep-like state , and now , weird as a night on Neptune , awfully strange sentiments were coming trippingly from my tongue . <p> " Thought I might clean up around here , " I distinctly heard me say . " Paint that sign by the highway . " <p> A good idea , C-Dog told me . Damn good . <p> Then it happened again  --  more chitchat from somebody who sounded a whole lot like me . <p> " Got to get a haircut , though . Maybe shave a bit more often , too . " <p> That was the spirit , he said , then started gathering up the dishes , the proper washing of which he gave me painstaking instruction about for the next five minutes . Presently , he was back in front of me , hitching up his trousers , and for an instant I feared the bell had rung for Round Two , more whomping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he only shook my hand and said it was high time he hit the road , which gave me to imagine myself stranded on a wayside , thumb out , ragged as a hobo looking for help to go yonder . <p> " You take care , Randall Hidey , " he said . <p> I would , I told him , and watched him aim for the door . In front of me was his  --  now my  --  folder , pages sobering to ruminate upon . <p> " You 're not a pilot , are you ? " I asked . <p> It was a dumb question , the answer obvious as the Pope 's choice of religion , but C-Dog was sufficiently civil to address it anyhow . Not a chance , he said . He 'd been a lot of things  --  farmer , a sewer contractor out of Big Spring , a wholesaler of Mexican artifacts , a diesel mechanic for an OTR outfit called Handy Haulers  --  but never a flyboy . <p> " Scared of heights , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A ruse , eh ? " <p> He shrugged : What could he say , he said . In his business , you needed to be sly . Catch the subject off-guard . <p> So that 's when I put it to him . About the shirt . <p> For a moment he looked puzzled , like a grown-up watching an infant cha-cha-cha . <p> " I wonder if I might buy it , " I said . <p> To be sure , this was a seriously sappy episode , but , as I told Mona the next day , this is how life is among the kind we are  --  sap , goo , every icky thing else pooh-poohed by know-it-alls . <p> " Buy it , " he repeated , words clearly new to his vocabulary . <p> A keepsake , I told him . A memento . Like a postcard . Or a curio . Say you been to the Grand Canyon , or the Empire State Building , naturally you want- <p> " Hell , " he said , " I should give it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unbuttoned that oooohhh-worthy item and made me a present of it . <p> " Got ten more of them , anyway , " he said . " Buy in bulk . That 's my motto . " <p> Briefly , I considered rising to watch him leave , but my butt would have no part of that plan . I lay where I was , belly down , chin on a pillow C-Dog had brought me once the athletics had ended . I lay there , I say , heard him open and dose the door to his Imperial , a thwunk as good to hear as are the squeaks of delight your offspring make when they see you coming up the walk . <p> He did n't start her immediately , and for an instant I wondered if he 'd forgotten something or had changed his mind about the shirt . Then that car turned over , chugga-chugga , and you could hear the crunch of gravel as he pulled around toward the highway . It was late evening now , many stars to bask beneath , and no evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He honked adios , and for a time I listened to him go south , his a motor with rumble enough to make you smile , until there was only silence and me , blessed as are the dumb and well-fed , alone at my place . <p>
