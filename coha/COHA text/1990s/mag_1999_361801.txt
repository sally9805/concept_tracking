Lorene Chandler 's day begins with a pale green plastic tray and a glass of water . Popping the top of one of the tray 's compartments , each marked for a day of the week , she pours out a handful of pills . Capoten , for blood pressure , comes first , on an empty stomach , and then come nine others , with coffee and orange juice and her Grape-Nuts cereal . Like many seniors , Chandler , 79 , takes part in another regimen at the end of each month : she gets a ride from her home in Corrigan , Texas , to the drugstore where she sometimes pays as much as $300 to keep her trays  --  she has a second one for bedtime doses  --  filled with Atenolol , Imipramine , Norvasc and other drugs . When she is done , much of her Social Security check is gone . " There 's not very much left for food , " she says . " But growing up during the Depression , it learned me how to save on groceries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political ad  --  at least not yet . But by the end of the summer , Chandler may well have film crews in her living room . She and the nearly 40 million other Medicare recipients whose drug bills are not covered by the government 's health plan for the elderly will be at the center of a high-profile joust between the President and Republicans . Both sides plan to introduce some kind of prescription-drug benefit into the Medicare system while retrofitting the 34-year-old program to keep it from collapse . Even before Clinton could formally announce his plan , scheduled for this week , the Republicans attacked his proposed premium increase as a tax hike , labeling the whole plan another sneaky attempt at government control of health care . Many Democrats are spoiling for a fight , hoping a messy display might win back the hearts of seniors who embraced the G.O.P. in the past two elections . <P> Nearly 80% of seniors take at least one pill a day , according to a recent survey . The number of medications in development for diseases associated with the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The increased number of prescriptions and the rising cost per pill mean seniors are on a treadmill of ever increasing expenditures . In the past five years national spending for all prescription drugs increased almost 60% . That pace is expected to continue . As seniors become more dependent on these remedies , they are also subjecting themselves to the increasing cost of the medicines . While only a third of Medicare recipients are completely without drug coverage of any kind , many of those who buy supplemental insurance through former employers , Medicaid , HMOs or Medigap must still pay a stiff part of their drug costs . <P> Medicare was a treacherous battlefield before anyone suggested a new entitlement . Most experts agree that adding items and fundamentally reforming Medicare will require some kind of sacrifice by beneficiaries , either paying higher premiums or delaying the eligibility age . But suggesting such reforms may carry a high political price . " There are some in both parties who want the election to be based on whose fault it is we did nothing about Medicare , " says Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to consensus largely over the issue of how much coverage to provide for drugs . Says Breaux : " Republicans want to blame Democrats for how badly the system works , and Democrats want to say that Republicans are cutting your benefits . "
