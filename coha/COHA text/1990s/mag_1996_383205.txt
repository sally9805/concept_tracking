Mother-anddaughter herb experts Madalene Hill and Gwen Barclay show us how they close the season of plenty and preserve summer 's flavor , for the months to come . // When the first frost is only weeks away , summer 's herbal bounty becomes a mixed blessing . We 've been spoiled by the basil , oregano , thyme , and chives that sprouted anew whenever they were trimmed . Much has been taken for granted , and now there is much to lose . We traveled to Texas and asked Madalene Hill and her daughter Gwen Barclay to lend us their expertise in preserving all the flavor of summer . Former owners of Hilltop Herb Farm and authors of Southern Herb Growing ( Shearer Publishing ) , they now work and reside at International Festival-Institute at Round Top , Texas , where young musicians from around the world come to study and perform , much to the delight of Texas concertgoers . In fact , music permeates everything at Festival Hill , and the kitchen is no exception . Madalene is the curator of the showplace herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used to teach music , is the director of food services . Each herbal leaf that finds its way to Gwen 's table has a voice as distinctive as the flute , cornet , or cello . Some are shrill and bring sharp highlights to a dish . Others are mellow , offering a savory foundation of flavor . But under her direction , their harmonies are perfectly composed . Gwen and Madalene have brought herbs into daily life at Festival Hill . In addition to seasoning the fare served to staff and guests , they host workshops for visitors who would like to learn more ( see page 68 for details ) . The herb gardens are a destination in themselves . Although still developing , they offer a magnificent overview of culinary herbs for gardeners unfamiliar with growing them . So what do Gwen and Madalene do to preserve the herbs of summer ? Their suggestions are many , and their ideas ring with the simplicity and confidence that come from having taken their own advice season after season .

BASIL WREATH Photograph // The ideal is to cut basil often so it never flowers and sets seeds , but this is difficult to do , particularly if you want to go out of town for a week or two during the summer . If your basil plants are covered with these spikes , you need to remove them to spur new growth . But do n't throw them away ; make a wreath . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them onto a wire form . The green seed  --  heads of Lettuce Leaf basil are shown at left . If your basil has already flowered and gone to seed , use the seedheads , while they are green and flexible , to make the base of a fragrant wreath . The one pictured above is made of African Blue basil seedheads . MAKING HERBAL VINEGARS Flavorful dressings and marinades begin with these incredible vinegars that Gwen bottles at season 's end . She recommends packing the bottle full of herbs and topping it off with the same high-quality vinegar after each use to keep the herbs covered . REFILLABLE BOTTLES Photograph Photograph Photograph STEP 1 Begin by adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of herb seeds such as anise , caraway , celery , cumin , coriander , dill , fennel , or mustard . Then add I tablespoon of whole spices such as allspice , cinnamon sticks , cloves , mace , black or white peppercorns , Szechuan peppercorns , or star anise . Add 3 to 4 large garlic cloves , peeled . Then drop 1 or 2 dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you can use fresh if you split them in half lengthwise before you drop them in . Photograph ST PS 2 &; 3 Use a vegetable peeler to remove strips of orange , lemon , or lime rind . Insert a few sprigs of any fresh herb into the bottle so the colorful rind does n't sink to the bottom . Then coax the strips into the bottle using a wooden skewer . Photograph STEP 4 Continue adding any combination of herbs , but be sure to use parsley , chives , and bay leaves . Remove brown woody stems . To insert floppy chives , fold long leaves in half and twist them into the neck of the bottle . Photograph STEP 5 Add vinegar at room temperature to the neck of the bottle ; heated vinegar will destroy the flavorful oils in the herbs . Gwen suggests either red or white wine vinegar , rice , cider or other fruit vinegars . Avoid using sharp , flavorless white distilled vinegar or artificially flavored or colored products . Be sure to go back the next day and top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to air bubbles among the herbs . Let stand overnight before using . // REFILLABLE BOTTLES You can refill your herb vinegar bottles the equivalent of three times . You 'll know when the herbs are spent because they will begin to disintegrate and their level will be reduced by half . DRYING FRESH-CUT HERBS Probably the most familiar and simplest way to preserve herbs is drying , and one of the most prolific of herbs in the garden this time of year is basil . WASHING HERBS FOR DRYING Instead of wetting the herbs after cutting them and thereby prolonging the drying process , try this easy method : Rinse herbs with a gentle spray from the garden hose and let them dry before you cut them . Be careful not to splash soil onto the leaves . Photograph STEP I Cut plants back by one-third , preferably when they are beginning to flower . Cut just above a pair of leaves . New shoots will sprout from this point , giving you even more basil for another harvest in a few weeks . Always cut a stem , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Pinch leaves off the stem , leaving the tender rib in place . Be careful not to bruise the foliage ; that will cause basil to blacken . Do n't discard the tough stems . Set them aside to dry , and then throw them on the fire this winter for their fragrance . Photograph STEP 3 Cover the basil leaves with newspaper to minimize oxidation and blackening . Toss them once or twice each day to help them dry evenly . They should be sufficiently dry after three days in an air-conditioned home . Crumble and store in an airtight container . // Instead of wetting the herbs after cutting them and thereby prolonging the drying process , try this easy method : Rinse herbs with a gentle spray from the garden hose and let them dry before you cut them .
