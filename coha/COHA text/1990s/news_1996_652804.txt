<p> PEOPLE WITH SHORT MEMORIES Americans , say  --  may see the early-music movement as a relatively recent invention , dating from the 1950 's and 60 's , when it began to command a major segment of the classical recording industry . They may see it , too , as a product of American ingenuity  --  that of the sainted early-music pioneer Noah Greenberg and the New York Pro Musica Antiqua  --  later taken over by the English , who have ruled the roost ever since . <p> Even if the history were accurate , it is now ancient . New York and the United States can hardly trade any longer on Greenberg 's glory while awaiting a new messiah . And the English scene , which was perhaps never as vital as national boosterism in the press and recording industry made it seem , has stagnated . Over the last decade , while no one was looking , the center of gravity of the early-music world shifted , from London  --  more precisely , from some watery point between London and Amsterdam  --  to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the move is simply a historical correction , restoring curatorship of older repertory , instruments and interpretive wisdom to one of its original seats and 1950 's hotbeds . <p> Yet the shift is significant , for it both reflects and furthers a revitalization in the performance of early music throughout Central Europe , even as such efforts languish in the United States . Moreover , through recordings the shift has given worldwide prominence to a gritty interpretive style inspired in large part by a Cologne favorite son , Reinhard Goebel , the director of Musica Antiqua Koln . Without necessarily intending to , this style also gives performers on conventional instruments an avenue back into early repertory , which they have too readily ceded to specialists in recent decades . <p> The Cologne manner , though no less " historically informed " than the often slick and faceless performances still trickling out of London , seems more intent on finding and putting across the individuality of a composer  --  indeed , of a single work . It is a rebuke to authenticist navel-gazing , which dominated early music a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation , which has for decades inflicted so much blandness on conventional performances of standard repertory . <p> In short , early music has gone post-modern , making scholarly considerations elbow for room with Romantic rhetorical gestures and outright personal whimsy . And aptly , it has done so in a city where noble antiquity  --  what little of it survived Allied bombing in World War II  --  nestles casually alongside often ugly modernity . <p> As a historic commercial crossroads , Cologne ( Koln , to natives ) has always been a melting pot . Over the last two decades , it has become a powerful magnet for performers of early music , not least from the United States . Michael Willens , a bass player and conductor once busy in New York , moved here a few months ago , joining expatriates of such long standing as Benjamin Bagby and Barbara Thornton , who established the medieval vocal group Sequentia here in 1977 . <p> Recordings have offered glimmerings of such developments , but the full reality of the situation , as shown in the Rheinisches Musikfest here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mustered more than one or two Baroque orchestras ; London , in its mid-80 's heyday boasted some half-dozen , but they all drew heavily on the same pool of overworked , underpaid musicians and , thus , all tended to sound alike . Cologne now has at least that many Baroque orchestras with independent memberships and distinctive personalities . <p> " Even if London is 10 or 12 times bigger than Cologne , we have 10 times more performers of early music , " said Klaus L. Neumann , who , as director of early music at the West German Radio in Cologne , has worked with musicians from both cities . Even after allowance for hyperbole  --  London 's population is 7 million ; Cologne 's , 1 million  --  the sheer quantity of activity here is as remarkable as the quality . <p> Its range was suggested in a remarkable series of concerts by Cologne groups , woven into the festival 's multitextured fabric with no particular fanfare . In the space of three evenings , scattered among folk , pop and avant-garde presentations , Sequentia sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson led Musica Fiata Koln in works by the early Baroque master Michael Praetorius ; Mr. Goebel and Musica Antiqua explored Rhenish Baroque composers as obscure as Carolus Hacquardt and Hugo Wilderer ; Condanza Spirituale offered modern dance to works by Tarquinio Me rula and Bach , and Christoph Spering and Das Neue Orchester performed Schumann 's " Manfred " on early instruments , with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau speaking the title role . <p> " At the moment , there is a very big gap between 1300 and 1550 , " the earnest Mr. Wilson , a transplanted Englishman , said of Cologne 's early-music coverage without a trace of irony . " There 's nothing going on there , and that 's a big disappointment . " Could any other city define its deficiencies so narrowly ? A New Yorker did n't know whether to laugh or cry . <p> Not heard on this visit were countless other performers , including the venerable Cappella Coloniensis , which set a modern standard of Baroque playing in the 1950 's ; Cantus Colln , which excels in early Baroque vocal music , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Concerto Koln , one of the hot newer bands , required a side trip to Hamburg . <p> Indeed , but for the festival , it would have been hard to glean any quick sense of the scope of activity here . For Cologne , a smallish city , after all , does not sustain a lively early-music " scene . " Instead , it functions as a center , radiating performances through tours , recordings and broadcasts . <p> The West German Radio ( or WDR , for Westdeutscher Rundfunk ) , which is based in Cologne , has been crucial to this development . Under the enlightened leadership of Alfred Krings , a legend hereabout , the WDR founded the Cappella Coloniensis in 1954 and became the first network to establish an early-music department , in 1976 . Mr. Neumann , who has directed the department ever since , has been a nurturing godfather to early music not only in Cologne but also throughout Germany . Working with musicologists around the world , his staff prepares reams of old repertory , much of it untouched for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such remarkable industry springs up overnight . Cologne traces its musical antiquarianism back to 1835 , when Mendelssohn carried forward his project of Baroque revivals with Handel 's oratorio " Solomon " at an earlier Rhenish music festival . The work was presented " in its original form , with no changes whatsoever , " the Kolnische Zeitung , a local newspaper , reported , despite the proto-Victorian chorus of 427 and orchestra of 179 . <p> INFLUENTIAL DENIZENS OF THE city fostered enthusiasm for old instruments and repertory fully a century ago . So how did Cologne lose its edge ? <p> From the remote perspective of the United States , Germany seemed a nonstarter in in the great upswelling of early music in the 70 's . Even the Collegium Aureum , founded in Cologne by Krings in 1962 and directed by Franzjosef Maier , retained a wiry , " modern " sound , to judge from LP 's , despite its use of period instruments . <p> The impression was not wholly erroneous . <p> " The disaster started with the students ' revolution in ' 68 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders was the well-known musicologist Adorno . He always hated music which was not performed to perfection . At the time , there were many amateurs doing early music , and the ban on music played by amateurs followed through the students and right into the schools . So the early-music scene in Germany vanished . " <p> In fact , the influential Theodor W. Adorno 's antipathy toward the early-music movement extended farther , to its perceived aims . " At times one can hardly avoid the suspicion that the sole concern of today 's Bach devotees is to see that no inauthentic dynamics , modifications of tempo , oversize choirs and orchestras creep in , " he wrote in 1967 . " They seem to wait with potential fury lest any more humane impulse become audible in the rendition . " <p> SO IT IS HARDLY SURPRISING that when early-music performance took new life in Germany in the late 70 's , it not only displayed high technical standards but also partook of a new esthetic , concerned more with musical expression than with precise historical reconstruction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the lead in developing a new German style of performance . It is actually a multiplicity of styles . At his best , Mr. Goebel seems to be divining , even brilliantly inventing , a suitable style for each work , as in his superb , dryly understated 1981 recording of Jean Gilles 's precariously sweet Requiem . <p> " We make it very mannered and sophisticated , very Continental , " he mincingly told a player in a rehearsal for the festival concert , partly , perhaps , for the amusement of a visitor . But when Mr. Goebel upbraided another player , demanding " activity " rather than passivity , he struck to the heart of Cologne style , which is everywhere hands-on , engaged , fiery . When a cellist failed to inflect the continuo adequately , Mr. Goebel played the entire line on his violin , showing ways to color and differentiate every note . <p> The ebullient Mr. Goebel , one of Franz josef Maier 's more rebellious students , is universally cited as the charismatic leader of early-music life in Cologne today . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of the city 's early-music specialists have performed with it , as extras in larger works if not members . And for good or ill , no one who has worked with Mr. Goebel is likely to forget the experience . Intensity shines through his round face , rosy features and puckish demeanor . He is an inspiring , sometimes brutal taskmaster with a delightful , often scathing wit . <p> At 43 , he is also a felicitious symbol for this city , which lost 90 percent of its historic center to bombing raids in World War II and quickly rebuilt , not always prettily but with bullish determination . Mr. Goebel used to lead Musica Antiqua as a crack fiddler but was afflicted with repetitive stress syndrome five years ago , losing the ability to finger with his left hand . He has since retrained himself to play with hands reversed , a feat with few , if any , precedents at the international virtuoso level . ( Rudolf Kolisch , of the famed Kolisch and Pro Arte Quartets , did likewise early in the century after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viola and have worked my way back up to second violin , " Mr. Goebel said . " I promise you that I will play the Bach sonatas before I am 50 . " No one who knows him doubts it for a moment . <p> " This city is very much like Reinhard , " said Mr. Bagby , of Sequentia . " He 's from around here , and he 's a smart aleck . The image I always have is , this is a river town , and he 's like the Mark Twain of early music . He 's smart , he 's fresh , he 's critical , and he 's productive . Everybody 's passing through all the time , and nothing impresses him . " <p> Mr. Goebel cites as his mentor not his principal teacher , Maier , but the irascible harpsichordist Hugo Ruf . " He 's a living difficulty , " said Mr. Goebel , who might as well have been describing himself . <p> " What comes out of the town  --  and that is an inheritance of my teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . " Let 's expand the barriers and the limitations of normal repertoire . In England , if one group starts with Haydn , two others start with Haydn  --  by accident . Here there is a sort of respect . I want respect for what I do , and I give it to others . " <p> So while all those Mozart , then Beethoven , then Haydn disks were emanting from London , Musica Antiqua was exploring little-known music by Johann David Heinichen and Francesco Maria Veracini , and Concerto Koln was trying Antonio Rosetti and Johann Baptist Vanhal . <p> Then again , this repertory may just need the Cologne touch , for it does not , by and large , consist of undisputed , towering masterpieces . " It is not music of structure , " said Werner Ehrhardt , the violinist who leads Concerto Koln , " but wonderful music . " Not so much transcendent and imposing as earthy , mercurial and charming , it takes some selling to lift it out of its time , a task for which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that style  --  or , again , that complex of styles  --  " a little bit extravagant " and is more inclined than Mr. Goebel to credit it to Maier . " Do n't play shy , and always together with the others , " Mr. Ehrhardt quoted Maier , in words that might serve as a motto for this rough-and-ready city , which stoutly maintains its own German dialect ( Kolsch ) and its own type of beer ( yes , Kolsch ) . <p> Crucially for early music , Cologne has also produced and held a steady supply of charismatic figures , from Krings on , distinctly unlike New York . The most dynamic American in the field , William Christie , has cast his lot to wondrous effect with the French . <p> " It 's very sad about the States , " said Mr. Willens , the new American Kolner . " I hope early music does n't disappear totally there , but it could , within the next 30 years or so . It 's sad , because there are so many talented players . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership there . " <p> Mr. Willens tried to supply some , founding the Orchestra of Then and Now in New York , to play early and modern repertory . It sank without a trace . So far , he reports , omens are better for his Cologne counterpart , the Orchester Damals und Heute . Cologne Comes Home <p> Here is merely the tip of the iceberg : a few CD 's in which early-music specialists at work in Cologne make overfamil iar masterpieces sound fresh or works of the second rank seem first-rate . * Heinichen : Dresden Concertos ( Musica Antiqua Koln directed by Reinhard Goebel . Archiv 437 549-2 ; two CD 's ) . One of the greatest , most revealing Baroque recording projects ever , which has produced several follow-ups , including Heinichen vocal music ( 447 092-2 ; two CD 's ) . * Rebel : " Les Elemens " ; Gluck : " Alessandro " ; Telemann : Sonata in E minor ( Musica Antiqua Koln directed by Mr. Goebel . Archiv 445 824-2 ) . Three very different works , each given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Rosetti : Symphonies ( Concerto Koln . Teldec 4509 98420-2 ) . Another great revelation , which has inspired Concerto Koln to present a Rosetti festival in Cologne . * Mendelssohn : String Symphonies ( Concerto Koln . Teldec 4509 94565-2 , 98435-2 ) . With a third disk to follow , a survey of youthful Mendelssohn works that shows how effectively the intense Cologne style avoids any hint of preciousness. * Bach : " Clavierubung I , II " ( Andreas Staier , harpsichordist . Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 05472-77306-2 ; three CD 's ) . Thoughtful yet spontaneous readings of the partitas and the " Italian Concerto . " * " Canticles of Ecstasy , " " Voice of the Blood " : Music of Hildegard of Bingen ( Sequentia directed by Barbara Thornton . Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 05472-77320-2 , 77346-2 ) . A definite up side to the chant boom : utterly committed singing devoid of mooning sentimentality .
