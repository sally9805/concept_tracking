It took 13 years to capture Reagan on the page , and now his biography is finished . ( So stop asking ! ) <p> ALL OF US , GREAT AND SMALL ( I SPEAK WITH PARTICULAR authority regarding the latter category ) , have to brace ourselves against certain conversational cliches . Anorexics must explain how they manage to stay so slim . Basketball players are asked what the weather is like up there , while Australians endure jokes about life " Down Under . " Biographers , being practitioners of the world 's slowest discipline outside of stalactite study , daily wince at the question " When 's your book coming out ? " I have kept a careful tabulation of the times I have been thus needled since beginning a life of Ronald Reagan in 1985 , and at last count , the wince total stands at 726,354,925,267 . <p> At times the sting of these needles is such that one seeks comfort from fellow sufferers . I 've gotten some relief simply from being married to Sylvia Jukes Morris ( 15 years on Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long I took on Reagan , she was still four lengths ahead in the biographical stakes . But then in x996 she mailed off her last chapter , and I had to look elsewhere for consolation . <p> " How do you handle The Question , Jean ? " I asked of Jean Strouse ( 14 years on J. P. Morgan ) . She recoiled out of sheer habit , then said wearily , " I change the subject . " " Does that work ? " " No , but at least it gives me time to edge towards the door . " <p> I 've not been able to broach the subject with Robert Caro ( 12 years on LBJ ) or the all-time champ , Nancy Milford ( 23 years on Edna St. Vincent Millay ) , but I did get some excellent advice from David McCullough ( ten years on Harry Truman ) on how to deal with those most persistent questioners , one 's editors . <p> " Oh , I just lie , " he said tranquilly . <p> " But you ca n't lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes , but look at the years you 've gained in the meantime . " <p> " What about when they start to threaten ? " <p> " Send ' em a chapter . " <p> My editor , Robert Loomis , is famed for his patience ( he allowed Neil Sheehan 16 years on John Paul Vann ) as well as his taciturnity . When I finally called to say that 1,457 pages of Dutch : A Memoir of Ronald Reagan were on their way , all he said was , " That 's great . " <p> Maybe he thought I was lying . <p> NOT ALL BIOGRAPHERS ARE SLOW , OF COURSE . Jeffrey Meyers seems to put out a new literary life every year , and despite this pace always manages to spell the name of his subject correctly . Ted Morgan , the fastest scribe since Sanche de Gramont , actually bats out finished text on a laptop right there in the archive . Now that AT &T; is wiring the whole country , I do n't doubt that his next book will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted ! How about linking two Toshibas ? Then you could do bios of DeWitt and Lila Wallace simultaneously ! ) <p> Once , during a performance of Parsifal at the Kennedy Center , Daniel J. Boorstin-an omnivorous intellect and no mean batter-out of manuscripts himself  --  took advantage of the Good Friday music to tell me about the habits of the Costa Rican three-toed sloth . " It spends all its life hanging upside down in the same tree , and moves from branch to branch so slowly that its droppings form a solid circle around the roots . " Since he was one of the first people to prompt me to write a Reagan biography , I wondered if he was not sending a metaphorical message . <p> If so , he did n't have to . Guilt is as endemic to biographers as , well , fleas to sloths . No needle has ever caused me greater pain than something my subject himself wrote on a White House photograph of me shaking his hand at some posh reception . Underneath , his polite , laborious script inquired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing ? <p> WELL , THE BOOK IS DONE , ALTHOUGH I SHOULD PERHAPS quote Anatole France 's consolatory mot , " A work of art is never finished , only abandoned . " The Question no longer torments . But it 's bound to be succeeded by another , equally aggressive variant , " What took you so long ? " I thought I 'd see how my wife handled it . <p> " Darling . " <p> No response . She 's reading an analysis of Pete Sampras 's serve , and the Melior is cooling . <p> " Darling . " <p> " Hmm ? " <p> " Your book . What took you so long ? " <p> She looks at me without expression and says , " You need a haircut . " <p> Well , I could try that on Lesley Stahl , I suppose , but doubt it 'll get me very far . <p> " Ms. Stahl , you need  --  " <p> " Cut . Guys , we 're going to have to do this again . Edmund , this is television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesley . And do I call you ' Ed ' ? " <p> " I 'd prefer Ishmael . " <p> " Really ? Okay . Guys , do we have speed ? Uh , Ishmael , what took you so long ? " <p> " Lesley , you need  --  " <p> " I 'll tell you what I need , you pointy-headed pensucker , I need a straight answer to my question , or you 'll never get your sorry ass on TV again . " <p> All right , inquisitors of the world , here 's why ars longa biographica est , and make what you will of it . ( NOTE TO FELLOW LIFERS : The following excuses , apologia , obfuscations , and pleas are in the public domain . Feel free to substitute the name of your subject wherever that of mine appears . ) <p> IN THE FIRST PLACE , I HAD TO GET TO KNOW RONALD Reagan , and it 's not easy to spend time alone with a sitting President . ( At least , until Monica Lewinsky figured out an ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an inviolable role that unless you were his wife or chief of staff or secretary , or belonged to an extremely small council of familiars , you had to see him in company with a senior White House aide . My Oval Office access was regarded as extraordinary , in that I interviewed the President , on average , once a month , but Scheduling Director Frederick J. Ryan Jr . always sat in on these conversations . I do n't think Fred interjected a word in all those years of Q and A ( except , " Mr. President , I think your next visitor is waiting " ) , but even so , his discreet presence was inhibiting . <p> Not , of course , that I would have developed much intimacy with Mr. Reagan in a true tete-a-tete . His smiling aloofness served him as well in biographical encounters as at superpower summits : If Gorby could n't bat one past him , what chance the authorized scribe ? <p> Indeed I have to be grateful to Fred Ryan for providing a quorum , theatrically speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's company and two 's a crowd ; he did things for us both that he probably would n't have done for me alone . I still cherish the memory of him performing a mimetic routine , which I guess I 'll save for my book , but let me just say , it involved some looseness of the wrists , and was as exquisitely " incorrect " as it was funny . <p> All biographers who care at all about their art will testify that they can not begin to write until they 've at least halfway understood the person they 've contracted to explain . And the complexities of human personality are so infinite , halfway is about as far as one ever gets toward comprehension , whether the relationship be literary or mentorial or even marital . ( Notice how infrequently husbands and wives chronicle one another ? There 's a reason : Intimacy compounds mystery . ) <p> Even if Mr. Reagan had been the most forthcoming character in the world , that First Basic Law of Biography , write only what you know , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was refreshingly incapable of lying , but his honesty , paradoxically , made my work harder , because the Second Basic Law of Biography is , by their lies ye shall know them . Clare Boothe Luce lied enough to beat Lillian Hellman , but my wife delighted in the old lady 's whoppers , because they yielded rich psychological insights . <p> What is a lie , after all , but an attempt to gain advantage ? If a man falsities his military record , you have already learned something you wo n't find in that record : that he 's embarrassed by it . If a woman complains about her children 's ingratitude , she 's only challenging you to find out that she might have been the one who shortchanged them . And piousness is no guarantee of verity . I remember Jimmy Carter , two years out of the Presidency , reacting with surprise vehemence when he found out whom my wife was writing about . " Clare Boothe Luce - she was livin ' in Honolulu in , uh , splendor when Ah was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat but once a week , while Miz Luce was entertainin ' all her millionaire friends at Diamond Head . " An affecting story , except that Clare did n't get to Hawaii until 1969 , 19 years after Lt. Carter transferred out of Pearl Harbor . If I were Jimmy 's biographer , I 'd get some mileage out of that little fantasy . <p> Mr. Reagan 's truthfulness , therefore , stood in the way of the truth  --  which is to say , the hardboard of fact upon which we all paint our self-portraits . Even the most honest of artists will instinctively pose a certain way , and arrange the lighting and color scheme just so , in order to make the composition " work " to his satisfaction . And if he has repeatedly painted the same picture , by request , over the course of 4o-odd years , it 's going to be so stylized as to amount ( with the best intentions in the world ) to a portrait of someone else . At times , as the President segued happily into a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wish he was capable of just the teeniest bit of that excreta tauri which biographers love to pounce on . <p> Having previously chronicled Theodore Roosevelt , who died 6o years before I got him to the top of San Juan Hill , I have often been asked about the differences between " live " and " dead " biography , and asked which kind is more congenial . The first person to ask me was Francis X. Clines of The New York Times , and it stumped me then as it stumps me now . My wife , however , had no hesitation in answering . She feelingly called from the next room , " Dead is easier ? Needless to say , Frank used that line as his opening quote , and a black T-shirt duly arrived from one of Sylvia 's friends , with the phrase lettered verso and recto . <p> My own less quotable opinion would be , however , Live or dead is equally difficult , not to say impossible . If one 's subject has moved , as TR would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously reluctant to discuss the afterlife except in terms of secular metaphor ) , then one is of course deprived of the immediacy of the flesh , the look , the sound , the texture , the revealing expression . On the other hand , if the flesh is still quick and sensibilities current , one lacks historical hindsight , and has to struggle with the knowledge that words hurt . Something about their black-and-white permanence on the page makes them both a terror and a scourge . <p> I learned that lesson when I wrote a portrait of my best friend from college days , a man I loved and admired although we were about as similar as Oscar and Felix . The portrait appeared in an a la recherche du temps perdu travel piece , and described our reunion after 21 years . I thought it was an affectionate tribute , and by way of making it plausible , dropped in one or two critical comments about the publishing house he worked for . He sent me a letter that he was not able to finish for anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To write about the living , therefore , is hard and risky . I once discussed with Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller the idea of writing an authorized biography of her husband . When she said she wanted to make sure the " absolute truth " came out , I wondered if that policy of honesty applied to the splendid , the rampant , the ecstatic liebestod of Nel 's last end . But I took one look into her eyes and knew I could not ask . <p> There are , of course , advantages as well as disadvantages in either type of biography . Live people casually reveal the kinds of things posthumous researchers rarely find out : how a certain smell or tune affects them , or what it feels like to drop the ballerina in the middle of Giselle . Which does n't mean to say their biographees are always cooperative : <p> BOSWELL : Pray , Sir , what do you do with orange peels ? You scrape them ... what next ? <p> JOHNSON : Nay , Sir , you shall know their fate no further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaries . Ours is an impatient age : When we have something to say ( or even when we do n't ) , we tend to pick up the phone . E-mail is a positive development for the next generation of biographers , providing people keep copies . But I should n't like to try to write the life of , say , Lew Wasserman , who prides himself on having less than a boxful of paper to show for his 60-odd years in the entertainment business . ( " Every deal I ever made is here in my head . " ) <p> Back around the turn of the century , ladies and gentlemen put everything down on thick creamy paper , and even their most trivial scraps often contributed figments of understanding . I once came across a sheaf of Metropolitan Club lunch orders , vintage 1897-1898 , in one of TR 's letterboxes , and was intrigued to discover that they all read " double lamb chops . " Here , in short , was an assistant secretary of the Navy so obsessively concerned with plotting the Spanish-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the menu . <p> Public figures , moreover , trusted one another in that more honorable time . Everyone in politics today is so suspicious of everyone else  --  and rightly so  --  that to commit a single important thought to paper is to see it on the Internet within hours . Hence most of the real business of the modern White House is conducted on walks in the Rose Garden , or in the men 's room with all faucets gushing . <p> IRONICALLY , GOVERNMENT NOW THUMPS OUT SO MUCH obfuscatory paperwork that presidential libraries both hide and entomb memory more protectively than the pyramids did . I remember the day I discovered this , shortly after the Ronald Reagan Library opened its doors under the aegis of the National Archives . The first slip I filed was for the President 's personal papers . <p> " I 'm sorry , but those items are not available to researchers , " said the archivist on duty . <p> " They are to me , " I said , flourishing my letter of authority , signed by the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the letter was no doubt subjected to ultraviolet and chirographical analysis by FBI agents in the basement , the archivist returned impassively . Behind him came a young female assistant pushing a truckload of gray boxes . <p> " This is as much as we can pull at one time , " he said . " About five linear feet of shelf space . Will it be enough for today ? " <p> " I should think so , yes . " <p> " We have approximately 30 linear feet for the period 1911-1980 , excluding of course Mr. Reagan 's official gubernatorial papers , which are at the Hoover Institution  --  " <p> He allowed himself a curatorial sigh . In bed at night , no doubt , he dreamed wistfully of the 19 tons of documents the President had already deposited upstate , before deciding that the Library should be closer to Los Angeles . " Hoover also has campaign material for 1976 , under separate deed of gift . However , 227 feet of records of the 1980 campaign are here  --  " <p> " Perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " leaving the rest of the week clear for the presidential stuff . " <p> He looked at me uncertainly . One should never joke with archivists , lest they avenge themselves by disconnecting the photocopier . He was actually being quite a good sport , trying to warn me that I should extend my contract with my publisher . The official Papers of President Ronald Reagan consist of 2,386 feet of alphabetical " name " files , 2oo feet of " sample " popular mail , 2,449 feet of " subject " files and 48 feet of " presidential handwriting . " To this must be added 126 feet of outtakes deemed " Confidential " and 1,008 feet of Confidential File Oversize Attachments . ( Interestingly , the latter collection outbulks the General File Oversize Attachments by 2io feet , suggesting that secretive correspondents dip bigger things to their memos than those with less to hide . ) In aggregate , Mr. Reagan generated about 5o million pages of reading material during his Washington years  --  about as much as the entire print catalog of Western civilization at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant idea . I 'm going to memorize the above statistics , the way Ronald Reagan used to memorize all the books of the Bible . And if Lesley Stahl ever asks me The Question on TV , I 'll zap her with them until she runs out of tape . <p> Or maybe I 'll just lie . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ronald Reagan shaking hands . <p> BY EDMUND MORRIS <p> <p> EDMUND MORRIS is the author of The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt .
