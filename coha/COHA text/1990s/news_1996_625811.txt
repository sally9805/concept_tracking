<p> BOISE , Idaho - She says Westerners are at war with the federal government , believes that white Anglo-Saxon men are " " an endangered species " and has become a hero to fringe groups around the nation who say no one else in Congress will speak up for them . <p> Whether Rep. Helen Chenoweth of Idaho , perhaps the most radical of the 73 freshmen Republicans sent to Congress in 1994 , will prove to be a liability or a plus for the Republicans could be one of the more compelling questions as this election year begins . <p> A foe of most functions of the federal government whose sympathies extend back to the Old South , Helen Chenoweth is the face Democrats would like to put on the first Republican-controlled Congress in nearly 40 years - a face that , they say , is too radical for mainstream America . <p> There are some indications that Chenoweth and like-minded freshmen may be too far to the right for Speaker Newt Gingrich , as well . The speaker was supposed to be in Idaho on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He canceled at the last minute , but did attend other Western events . <p> Aides to Gingrich said the public snub was the speaker 's attempt to gain more control over his rebellious freshman class . Chenoweth was one of 15 Republicans who , contrary to Gingrich 's wishes , voted against reopening the federal government last week . <p> Still , it is here in the Far West that Gingrich 's revolution finds not just some of its most enthusiastic supporters but perhaps its greatest peril . <p> Republicans made big gains in the West in 1994 . Yet some of the Western Republicans ' more extreme positions on guns and the environment , for example , have been hurting Republicans nationwide in the polls - a fact that Gingrich recently acknowledged . <p> Hope and fear , for Republicans , is embodied by Chenoweth , who represents a district that spans two time zones with a burgeoning high-tech community in the south and a festering neo-Nazi compound in the north . <p> Just after Chenoweth 's election in 1994 , a former Ku Klux Klan leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " " race-based campaigns . " <p> The Militia of Montana began selling videos of her speeches on the danger of one-world government control of natural resources . And anti-government groups embraced her as a favorite speaker . <p> Here at home , Chenoweth is seen by many supporters as a maverick who is not afraid to speak her mind or refuse to compromise . <p> But the poll numbers for Chenoweth , who was elected with 55 percent of the vote , have sagged to around 40 percent ; American Indian leaders are furious about her lack of support for them , and numerous questions have been raised about the money used to pay for her congressional campaign . <p> The Democrats have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission , saying Chenoweth took a $ 40,000 loan from Idaho 's largest bank without reporting it on her campaign disclosure form or securing the note with collateral . She acknowledged that the loan was secured with just her signature , but said that she has since taken out a mortgage to secure it . She said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another complaint , filed Tuesday with the election commission , accused Chenoweth of using $ 35,000 in campaign money for personal matters . She denied it , saying the accusation is a partisan shot . <p> No matter how those charges turn out , Chenoweth 's national profile is likely to remain high , as she tours the nation , a star of the property- and gun-rights speaking circuit , criticizing environmentalists and the federal government . <p> Unrestricted gun use , minimal federal environmental protections and abolishing the Education , Energy , Commerce and Housing departments along with the Environmental Protection Agency - these are some of the passions Chenoweth shares with many Republican freshmen . <p> Her wing of the Republican Party , she says , speaks to a new kind of populism , one that political experts say has strong appeal among poor and middle-class whites in rural areas of the West and South . <p> " " We want things to be the way they used to be , " Chenoweth said in an interview . Dressed in black tights , black dress and high heels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> She insists on being called " " Congressman Chenoweth . " <p> But even in Idaho , a state where Bill Clinton drew only 18 percent of the vote in some counties , the main tenets of the new Western Republicans are upsetting many people , according to recent polls . <p> For example , Chenoweth plans to introduce a bill that would require any federal agent carrying a firearm to have the local sheriff 's permission before entering a county on official duty . The proposal is dear to the hearts of many paramilitary members and gun advocates , but Idaho 's sheriffs say it is unworkable . <p> " " The last time I looked at the map we were still in the United States of America here in Bonner County , " said Chip Roos , president of the Idaho Sheriffs Association . " " So I do n't think you can stop a federal agent from coming into your county just because you might disagree with him . " Chenoweth , a soft-spoken former political aide to then-Rep . <p> Steve Symms and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most of her issues , is driven by her belief in state 's rights . <p> She favors the Old Confederacy . Though she is not in favor of slavery , she views the South 's position on the Civil War as " " a state 's rights issue , " she said in an interview . <p> The Party of Lincoln may have trouble with such assertions , but again , Chenoweth says , the party is changing , becoming more " " populist , " as she calls it . <p> After the 1994 election , Gingrich appointed Chenoweth to task forces on guns and endangered species . Critics , and even some supporters say her committee work , which has generated negative headlines nationally , has done more harm than good to Republicans . <p> Chenoweth has repeatedly insisted , for example , that federal Fish and Wildlife agents are using helicopters to work in Idaho , a mountain state with millions of acres of public land . <p> In paramilitary and survivalist circles , helicopters have particular resonance ; they are viewed as stealth agents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it has no helicopters in the gem state , or anywhere else in the West - and has asked Chenoweth to prove her assertion . <p> " " I have never seen them , " Chenoweth said . " " But enough people in my district have become concerned that I ca n't just ignore it . We do have some proof . " Nor does she discount another tenet of the paramilitary groups : that federal environmental regulations are the first step in one-world government , citing such things as the United Nations designating Yellowstone National Park a world heritage sight . <p> On race , Chenoweth says she does not agree with white supremacist groups . Most recently , she angered American Indians by saying the tribes had special hunting and fishing privileges that " " a white person " could not enjoy . <p> " " White men are an endangered species , " she said this week . " " I absolutely believe that . " Asked to explain further , she said , " " what with affirmative action and everything . " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew praise from Fields , a former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon . He publishes The Truth at Last out of Marietta , Ga. , a newspaper that recently carried headlines like " " Racial Purity Is America 's Security . " <p> After Chenoweth was elected , a story in the paper said her victory was evidence " " of a sea change in the mood of the white voter towards candidates who offer frank solutions to America 's growing nonwhite chaos . " <p> Chenoweth said she had sent a letter to the paper , distancing herself from it . " " I have no truck with these Klan people , " she said . " " I have no truck with neo-Nazis . And I have no truck with a person who uses violence against another person 's property . " <p> But in Idaho , which is 95 percent white and home to pockets of heavily armed racial separatists , critics say Chenoweth has only contributed to the state 's image as a haven for extremists . <p> Chenoweth dismisses criticism of her as Democratic Party carpings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out of ideas - and all they can do is throw mud at me . " Chenoweth faces no primary opposition in this year 's election , but she is already gearing up for the campaign , saying she has no plans to change her style , even against an eventual Democratic opponent . <p> TYPE : Biography
