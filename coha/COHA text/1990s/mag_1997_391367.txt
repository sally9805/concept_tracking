Noah Wyle is one smooth operator . Not only is ER 's resident heartthrob back for his fourth scenestealing season , he 's raising temperatures in his new movie , The Myth of Fingerprints . Now , if only he made house calls . By Martha Frankel // Everyone in the restaurant is staring . And smiling . This is more than an " Omigod , there 's a celebrity sitting over there " moment . This is the look people give an okl friend . On America 's number one television show , ER , Noah Wyle plays Dr. John Carter , a surgical resident with a soul , who has shown us that he can be smart , vulnerable , and sexy . We have watched Carter wrestle with his demons ( Should he turn in another resident for lying ? ) , seduce his boss 's boss ( the intelligent and much older Abby Keaton ) , and even turn his back on a friend at the worst possible moment ( intern Dennis Gant , who dejectedly left the hospital and committed suicide ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit less . In the drama The Myth of Fingerprints , in theaters this month , Wyle plays Warren , wh ( lio could be Dr. Carter 's longlost brother . Though the 27-year-old actor describes his character as " emotionally stunted because he 's never dealt With his demanding and cold father " he 's also csu-ing and sweet . As one of four adult children who returns home for a tense Thanksgiving weekend , Warren has an experience that changes his life . WYLE AT HEART Wyle will always have a special place in his heart for Fingerprints because that 's where he met his girlfriend , makeup artist Tracy Warbin , who includes Sling , Blade among her credits . The first day on location in Maine last summer , Wyle saw a woman " across the room " and was literally swept away . " It was one of those moments when you 're conscious of having your breath just taken away , " he says , his face getting a little red . " It probably only happens to you a couple of times in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her , and just like a teenage girl , I ran over to the director and asked , Who 's that ? ' She had to do my makeup that day , so I was sitting in her chair , talking and getting to know her . Within the first couple of hours , we discovered we had a tremendous amount in common : She has a 1964 Pontiac that is very similar to my 1960 Oldsmobile-they 're both boats . We have the same taste in music , and we 're both big Bob Dylan fans . The similarities started racking up . I met her on a Monday , and the following Friday I had to fly back to Chicago to shootironically enough-my breakup scene with Christine Elise ( who played intern Harper Tracy on ER ) . It was the Thursday night before I left when I kissed Tracy for the first time . " Wyle and Warbin have been living together in his Mediterranean house in Los Angeles ever since . They share a love of travel ( they just got back from tI two-week trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns a ranch near Yosemite , and they often go up there to ride ) , and animals ( they have four cats , two mutts , and some fish ) . Wyle says that his family and friends adore Warbin and that he can see them being together for a long , long time . " She 's perfect for me , " he says , staring lovingly at a silver ring , a recent present from his beloved . " We know how to make each other happy . " Photograph the cosmo interview // Although they have no plans yet to have children , Wyle can imagine that too . " I do n't know if anyone is ever really ready , " he says . " I know a lot of people who plan for years to get to a certain place when they can start their family . I hope that it happens when we 're in a good place , but if it happened tomorrow , it would be okay . " MY SON , THE DOCTOR Wyle himself has an extended family . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , he has an older sister and a younger brother . His parents divorced when he was very young . His mother is remarried to a film restorer who has three children of his own . His father also remarried and has another child . As Wyle says , " I 've shared a bathroom with them all at one point in my life ; in my mind , that makes you family . " Wyle has been interested in acting since he was 14 years old , when he went away to boarding school in Ojai , California , about an hour and a half north of Los Angeles . Although the school ran the gamut from " sucky to fabulous , " the theater department was pretty much left to its own devices . " That meant lots of freedom for us . " Wyle halfheartedly applied to college but never went , choosing to return to Los Angeles and begin working . He did theater and had small parts in the films A Few Good Men ( 1992 ) and Swing Kids ( 1993 ) before landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , seems thrilled by his success , although his 12-year-old sister ca n't figure out why her friends and their parents act so goofy around me . " THE DOCTOR IS IN For the last three years , the ER set has been Wyle 's second home . He 's there 14 hours a day , five days a week , nine months a year . Not surprisingly , he 's bonded with his castmates and considers some of them his closest friends . " I visit Tony Anthony Edwards , who plays Dr. Mark Greene and his wife when I need a close of what parenting is like . The Edwards have two young children . Their house is a blast . Me and Eriq La Salle , who plays Dr. Benton shoot pool together and are as thick as thieves . I think he 's so talented . And George Clooney , who plays Dr. Ross , as well as the new Batman and I shoot hoops at the studio and at his house . He 's like an old-time movie star-like Cary Grant or Spencer Tracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . " We were out one night , a warm night , and George had a Porsche convertible : a beautiful car , a limited-edition Speedster . It 's a twoseater , and we were driving around , and I said , You know how lucky you are to have a convertible in this weather ? I 've always wanted a convertible . ' I was just shooting my mouth off . The next day , he did n't have to work , and I did . He shows up on the set and says , ' I got a present for you , buddy . ' And he dangles these keys in front of me . He takes me outside , and there 's this two-tone 1960 Oldsmobile convertible : powder blue on the bottom and white on top . He says , ' I bought this car 10 years ago when I was your age and doing a sitcom . It 's been nothing but lucky for me , and it 's only fitting that you should have it . ' I still have that car . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season premiere of ER will be shot live-something that has never been done before in a medical drama . The idea came about when the cast was sitting around talking about the classic Requiem for a Heavyweight , which had originally been shot live for television:s Playhouse 90 in 1956 . " George thought it would be cool to do ER live , " Wyle recalls . " And it just grew from there . It 's going to test all of us . Some parts of the show are filmed on the back lot at Warner Brothers , others are shot on the set halfway across the lot . I guess they 'll be shuttling us around in golf carts to get us back in time . It 's going to be a wild night , but I think we 'll all be fine . We 've been playing these characters for three years now , and we know them inside out . Plus , lots of us come from theater backgrounds , so we know how to cover if we screw up . But trust me on this-it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die than make a fool of myself in front of 38 million viewers . " He actually knocks wood . Wyle has been approached by some of those viewers with the idea that their daughter would be just perfect for Carter . " I do n't understand it , " he admits with a shake of his head . " Carter spends all his time at the hospital , and none of the relationships he 's had has worked out . I do n't see him as marriage material , but what do I know ? " In fact , Wyle has created a whole history for Carter . " They told me his father was a doctor , but I decided his father and grandfather were surgeons . That 's why my decision to leave surgery is so weighted . And I know that Carter used to wrestle in college , because I once had to say to a patient , Oh , you went to Penn State ? I wrestled there . ' It was so embarrassing , because I had to throw my chest out and pretend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled by the fact that people often ask him for medical advice . " But I like to pretend . When a friend cuts their finger , I 'll say , Let me see that , hold it under the light . Okay , run cold water on it and rinse it out . Does that feel like a pin prick , or is it more of a throbbing pain ? Let me see if it needs stitches . ' And they 're like , Noah , it 's just a cut . ' Tony and I are thinking about opening a little clinic in his garage , " he kids . " It 's crazy . I have a good friend who 's a shoulder specialist . He 's dying to take me along when he does rounds , just to see who the patients feel more comfortable with . I have a feeling , as scary as it may sound , that more patients would respond to my bedside manner than his ! " Could Wyle do stitches if the need arose ? He starts to nod like crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I 'm the guy on the show who is always practicing , so I 've done a lot of sutures . I ca n't promise that it would be excellent workmanship , but it would be functional . " ON THE FAME GAME For Wyle , stardom fits as comfortably as a set of scrubs . He smiles at everyone in the restaurant and makes this fame thing seem as routine as an appendectomy . " It 's funny , " he says , sipping a cup of coffee and fiddling with his ring , " some days I do n't even notice it . Most of the time , people are complimentary . And I 'm an actor who loves compliments , so I find it very gratifying . And then there are days when you just do n't wan na be the guy on the TV show . You just want to hide . " It 's like there 's three waves of people : There 're the people that are big fans and would love to have your autograph . And that 's great . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the second wave , who saw the person ask for your autograph , and they were gon na ask , but they were a little shy . But since that person asked , they 'll tt.sk too . And that 's okay . Then there 's the third wave : the people who really had no intention of getting your autograph ; they do n't really care who you are , but everybody else is getting it , so they might as well get one too . And those are the people who are the worst . They ask , ' hat show are you on ? ' as if they 're just waiting for you to dazzle them . " Wyle certainly seems to be taking it all in stride . " Red Buttons was on the show last year . lie told me , Go out and enjoy your life , do n't be one of the schmucks who hides in your house and is afraid to do this and afraid to do that . Because when you get to be my age , all you have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected enough of them , you 'll know , " ' Wyle says . " And I lew as soon as he said it that he was right .
