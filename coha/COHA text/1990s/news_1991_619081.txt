<p> DO YOU get headaches from today 's musicals ? Do you wonder why that great American theatrical form has sunk to the bottom during the last couple of decades and why the percentage of failed shows rises steadily with the costs of producing them ? <p> There 's no shortage of good reasons . That 's no assurance that Broadway can reverse the trend of failure and get the American musical back on track . <p> A current leader in the thin field , " The City of Angels , " playing at the Golden Gate Theater through January 5 , is an interesting case because it has made a success of the very approaches that have brought most of its competitors down . For a quick example , it gets away with relegating music to a secondary role and dehumanizing it . The cold-pressure scream style of performance and the canned sound of amplification takes care of that . <p> Because that treatment of music long ago became the norm in a culture where taste is produced by the music industry , the public accepts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a razzle-dazzle of activity , throwing off tricks and gimmicks at a furious pace , the viewer can hardly take a breath , much less reflect on any one element . " City of Angles " would be a more apt name . <p> Do n't get me wrong . The piece works . It accomplishes its purpose , diverting its viewers completely and entertainingly . There is just no future in this approach for the Broadway musical , nothing more to be done along this line short of wiring up the viewers individually . Coming next , the electroshock musical ! <p> While the book is its most discussed element , fascinating in its complexity , people do n't seem to notice that the story is not what this show 's about . " City of Angels " is about a structure , a unique design complicated as a Baroque maze . The story line is essentially just the clothing for this form . The plot is the trim , the facing texture , color and ornamental motifs . <p> Eyes and ears are kept busy following this coruscating surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its staging , its mobile scenic architecture and all else is the crazy back-and-forth between reality and fantasy and , at times , the counterpoint of action in two realms at once . That 's what 's different and sort of original about " City of Angels . " That 's what keeps it cranked up to the pitch of intensity , speed and dazzle that Broadway demands today . <p> Actually , there 's precedent for this kind of structure as well as its in-your-face tempo , most recently in Stephen Sondheim 's " Into the Woods . " Sondheim juggles several of Grimm 's fairy tales at once , the characters eventually interacting . <p> " City of Angels " is the simultaneous telling of two modern fairy tales , the creation of a Hollywood film and the film itself in the 1940s . Hero No. 1 is a Hollywood writer , Stine , who is writing a Raymond Chandler-styled gumshoe screenplay for an awful producer-director caricature named Buddy Fidler . The musical cuts to and fro between Stine 's hassled , seesawing life and the movie scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , private-eye Stone . Stine sees himself as Stone and draws his other characters after individuals in his own life . As the stage action cuts between the Hollywood movie-making story and the movie- in-progress , the actors for the " real life " roles assume corresponding , usually caricatured parts in the movie . <p> Devilishly ingenious , it 's worked out from the tiniest irony and gag ( two per line of text ) to the culminating punch at the denouement . The wall separating reality from fantasy dissolves as Stine and Stone sing their contrapuntal duet , " You 're Nothing Without Me . " With this affirmation of the symbiotic dependency of writer and character , the plot is resolved and the last , key piece of the structure drops into place . <p> For that duet and other numbers , composer Cy Coleman takes his cue from the structural design of the moment . He exploits chances for counterpoint in two-way songs with a countermelody or second line imposed over the first , or with a melody answered by itself in good old-fashioned imitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Gabby , and Stone 's put-upon , adoring but ignored secretary , Oolie ( an Ado Annie type ) . <p> Standing in side-by-side sets , a hotel room and Stone 's office , Gabby and Oolie belt out in unison and counterpoint a number about the male causes of their frustration , " What You Do n't Know About Women . " Other composite numbers work well , including those that cleverly use a dance-band style mixed vocal quartet , the " Angel City 4 . " However , not even Coleman 's craft and all the show 's gadgetry and trickiness can solve the biggest problem of this show as a musical , and that 's centered in the lyrics of David Zippel . <p> As a lyricist , Zippel is a good gag writer , a wordsmith with a hot hand , caught up in writer Larry Gelbart 's Hollywood and Chandler style . Fist in your face , the lines skitter along overloaded with twists and wordplay . At times they are symmetrical as herringbone and rhythmically about as interesting . Or they are irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verbiage over a jazz line in the orchestra as a hard-hitting accompanied recitative . <p> Such lyrics and resultant settings free the show from set pieces , the good old solo numbers that slow down the pace , evidently the bugbear in Broadway today . They also free Coleman from the burden of writing good tunes . <p> There are a couple of straight solos in the show , almost like anachronisms , vestigial remains of the musical in the operetta tradition . Stone 's fallen ex-girlfriend Bobbi sings a torch song in a nightclub , " With Every Breath I Take " and another stand-up solo number is a show-stopper , " You Can Always Count on Me , " sung by actress Catherine Cox first in the role of Oolie in her bedroom and then in her other part , as Donna , the producer 's secretary , in her bedroom . <p> Basically however , Coleman is locked into anti-tune lyrics for this show . Thus one of our best composers of musicals ( " The Will Rogers Follies , " " The Ziegfeld Follies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet Charity " among others ) ca n't spread his wings and sing . <p> The singing is hard-belted Broadway blowout . The voices are anonymous and cliche , pushed and toughened , the women 's vocal style modeled at a far distance after Ethel Merman 's . One woman specializes in first holding a tone nail-straight to drive it through one of your ears and out the other , and then applying a wobbly tremolo that would make a gull seasick . Of course , it 's all miked loud enough to cause deafness in some and cure it in others , but that 's par for show biz today . <p> The electronic amplification and mixing that goes into popular music and theater as a matter of course has had a strange effect in our culture . The sound of a natural singing voice , one that is not electronically modified , probably seems unreal to most people under 40 . Reality and unreality have changed places , just as in the story of " City of Angels . " <p> Typically , the miking and mixing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the orchestrations and performance , all of it coming over speakers , makes the accompaniment seem canned , as if produced on prerecorded tape . <p> So the music in " City of Angels , " the element that 's supposed to be the most engaging feature in a musical , actually distances the viewer-listener from the show . In that respect , the score is in step with the play itself , its hard-surface dialogue and chrome-plated lyrics , the objectivist performers and surely the stylized characters they are cartooning . <p> A lot in this reflects the effect of television and that 's one of the big problems of the musical show today . When the musical competes with television 's pace , scenic complexity , technology and production budget , the show loses the qualities that make it a musical and live theater . <p> TELEVISION 'S influence on our lives and perceptual process has relevance to other forms of musical theater of our time as well , including opera . For all of its conditioning effect , however , the tube need not mean the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance as we know it . Quite the contrary . Television and television-influenced theater not only leave the central and vital field of performance art open and waiting , they enhance the very need for it . <p> In the short term , considered strictly as an evening 's entertainment , " City of Angels " is still a live-wire , fast show that wo n't quit . conceivably it deserves the four sets of awards it received , but just in relationship to what 's produced on Broadway these seasons , hardly major competition . In the long line of Broadway history , however , " City of Angels " likely will not earn a gold star , if only for musical reasons .
