Section : SPECIAL REPORT CRISIS IN THE GULF The inside story of secret diplomacy between the superpowers <p> Secretary of State James Baker brought troubling news . It was Aug. 1 , and Baker was in Irkutsk , Siberia , for meetings with his Soviet counterpart . He waited until lunchtime , when he was alone inside a ZiL limousine with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze . Central Intelligence Agency analysts , he said , were watching Iraqi forces mass at the Kuwaiti border . They predicted an invasion . " We hope you 'll try to restrain these guys , " he said . Shevardnadze demurred . He was confident that Saddam , a longtime Soviet client , did not plan to invade . <p> Baker and Shevardnadze did n't know it , but as the black ZiL rolled through Irkutsk the first test of the new , post-coldwar understanding between their governments was beginning . There was no guarantee the two countries would n't revert to their old adversarial roles . But at three crucial junctures during the Iraqi crisis , Presidents Bush and Gorbachev and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present a united front against Saddam Hussein . <p> August 2 : At 7:45 a.m. in Siberia , Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmittcalled Baker from Washington . Using elliptical language because it was an unsecured line , he reported that the CIA was now convinced that the invasion was only a matter of hours . Within the hour , Baker again told Shevardnadze . ( Administration sources wo n't say whether the Kuwaitis , the Israelis or others were warned . ) This time Shevardnadze gave Baker the impression that Saddam had assured the Soviets that he would not attack . " The crisis is being defused , " Shevardnadze insisted . <p> Iraqi forces were already rolling into Kuwait . Washington flashed the news to Baker , who had just appeared with Shevardnadze at a noontime press conference . When Baker told Shevardnadze , the Soviet Foreign minister was stunned  --  and embarrassed . " We have n't heard anything about it , " he said . Turning to an aide , Sergei Tarasenko , he ordered : " Look into this immediately . " The meeting broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy planning , to work out a joint response during Ross 's upcoming meetings in Moscow with Tarasenko . He and Ross sensed an opening in Shevardnadze 's obvious dismay . Baker then left for Mongolia . <p> As Kuwait City fell , Ross called Baker from Moscow to suggest a U.S.-Soviet statement that would not only condemn theinvasion , but call for joint action of some kind against Iraq . Ross proposed that Baker fly to Moscow to issue the statement with Shevardnadze if such a gesture could be negotiated . President Bush , in another phone call with Baker , signed on . Baker called Ross to issue the go-ahead , but added , " Be sure it 's a good statement . " Baker did n't want to be embarrassed by making the high-profile appearance , only to issue an equivocal message . <p> Ross pitched the idea to Tarasenko . A joint U.S.-Soviet call to action would deny Saddam Husse in the hope of finding cover in cold-war divisions , he argued . It would discourage other Arab states from supporting Saddam and show the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively , Ross warned , " The statement 's got to be strong if Baker 's going to fly back here . " Shevardnadze and Gorbachev agreed to the plan . Baker prepared to cut short his Mongolia trip to fly home via Moscow . Meanwhile , Washington had initiated an economic embargo . And with Soviet support , the United Nations Security Council almost immediately had condemned the invasion , calling on Iraq to withdraw . <p> August 3 : Arabists in the Soviet Foreign Ministry launched a counterattack . When Ross and Tarasenko met that morning in the American ambassador 's residence , the Soviet presented a statement filled with watery bureaucratese . Ross , dismayed , persuaded Tarasenko to rewrite it with tougher language . But after disappearing for three hours , Tarasenko returned with yet another weak version . " If we put out this statement , we 'll send exactly the wrong message to Saddam Hussein , " Ross argued . " It will be obvious that we are n't together on this . " Tarasenko agreed . He said that Arabists in the Soviet Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ross and Tarasenko again sharpened the statement . Tarasenko disappeared for another few hours . By now , Baker 's plane was nearing Moscow . Tarasenko finally came back with a version that was acceptable except for a crucial detail . A joint call for an arms embargo was bracketed  --  meaning the Soviets did n't want it included . Baker would have to settlethis directly with Shevardnadze , Tarasenko said . <p> Baker arrived at Moscow 's Vnukovo airport and the four men disappeared into an airport lounge . " This statement has to have teeth in it , " Baker argued . " It has to be clear to Saddam Hussein and the world that we 're together . " With little argument , Shevardnadze agreed . He also said that the Soviets would support U.N . economic sanctions against Iraq . But the Soviet Foreign minister stressed that the Soviets were n't consenting to American gunboat diplomacy . Baker assured Shevardnadze that Bush planned no unilateral military action unless American citizens were harmed . But Shevardnadze remained wary of a U.S. military move . <p> August 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see King Fahd . In a series of phone calls with Fahd , <p> Bush had already discussed sending U.S. troops to deter an attack on the kingdom . Bush 's plan was to secretly issue the first orders to send troops to the area late Monday . The troops were to begin moving Tuesday , but Bush would publicly announce it only Wednesday . <p> Bush did n't want to surprise the Soviets . It would be disastrous , he and Baker agreed that Monday morning , if the Soviets openly criticized the move or pulled out of the ongoing U.N . sanctions efforts . National-security adviser Brent Scowcroft , a key strategist , was intent on using the crisis to cement an unprecedented U.S.-Soviet relationship . He wanted to show " the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union working together , with the Soviet Union clearly the junior partner , " as one top-level source put it . The U.N . vote on a worldwide economic embargo was scheduled for that afternoon . So Bush told Baker to notify the Soviets in advance of the military steps  --  and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacationing Shevardnadze . <p> He told the Soviet Foreign minister of Bush 's plan . He detailed the latest U.S.intelligence estimates of the Iraqi buildup . He stressed that Bush was acting in response to a Saudi request , and assured Shevardnadze that Washington was n't trying to take advantage of the situation to enhance U.S. influence . Shevardnadze was not pleased . " Are you consulting us or are you informing us ? " he asked . Said Baker , " We 're informing you , I guess , but is n't there something we can do together here ? I have no authority to offer this , but would you think of contributing naval forces , or ground forces , yourself ? How can we work together on this ? " Shevardnadze did n't bite , so Baker tried again . " Look , is there something else we can do to cooperate on this ? " Replied Shevardnadze , " How about using the United Nations Military Staff Committee ? " The Soviets had been trying for years to revive the moribund committee , an adjunct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Baker consulted Bush and Gen. Colin Powell , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , about possible Soviet military involvement in the gulf crisis . Both liked the idea . Baker called Shevardnadze back to say that Bush was interested in pursuing the matter , and that-officially this time-the United States had no problem with a Soviet naval or land presence in the region . The moment was unprecedented in postwar U.S.-Soviet relations . " If President Bush is interested , then I 'll raise it with President Gorbachev , " Shevardnadze replied . <p> Baker 's proposal outraged the State Department 's Mideast bureaucracy . Angry memos flew . Baker was throwing away four decades of diplomacy devoted to keeping the Soviets out of the Middle East . But the Soviets did n't take Bush up on the offer-at least for the moment . The memory of Afghanistan may have been too fresh . Still , Bush and Baker felt the offer demonstrated good faith . " It was a major step for the Soviets to break with an old ally to issue a joint statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State Department official . " It was an equally major step for the United States to invite the Soviet Union to become militarily , as well as politically , involved in the gulf . " <p> August 17 : Baker left for vacation . During the previous 10 days , he had spoken to Shevardnadze almost daily . Washington and Moscow had cooperated on U.N . resolutions that condemned Iraq 's annexation of Kuwait and called on Iraq to release foreigners . Another crisis almost immediately loomed . The economic embargo seemed headed for a military showdown . The Soviets  --  as well as some traditional U.S. allies  --  were displeased by the Bush administration 's assertion that the American Navy was entitled to use force to police the embargo , without specific U.N . authorization . And an Iraqi oil tanker was steaming toward Yemen , where Washington feared it might unload oil . <p> From his 1,500-acre ranch near Boulder , Wyo. , Baker resumed his daily telephone calls to Shevardnadze in Moscow . Baker urged Bush , at his Maine vacation home , tohold off using military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically approved it . He urged Shevardnadze to get the Soviets behind such a resolution before time ran out . At the United Nations , U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering played the good cop . At least twice he told his Security Council colleagues that he had prevailed on Washington to extend its deadline for ordering the U.S. Navy to interdict Iraqi shipping . <p> August 20 : The Soviets still hoped diplomacy would provide a graceful way out . They received Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Sadun Hammadi , and demanded that Saddam withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait and release all foreign nationals . The next day , when Hammadi left , they played for time , hoping Saddam would come around . Shevardnadze asked Baker for another 48 hours , enough time for Ham-madi to try persuading the Iraqi leader . Baker invoked the bad cops  --  the Pentagon and National Security Council , which were pressing for permission to use force without U.N . cover . What about passing a U.N . resolution that night effective in 48 hours unless Saddam backed down ? Baker asked . " I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush he thought the Soviets would be on board in 48 hours . <p> August 22 : Shevardnadze replied by cable . The Soviets would move at the United Nations by Saturday , Aug. 25 , if Saddam was unyielding , he said . Baker called him . " We 'll give you your three days , " Baker said , " but will you promise me now that if we do move on Saturday , we will have your support ? " Shevardnadze didn'tgive Baker the explicit commitment he wanted , but Baker believed the Soviet Foreign minister understood that Washing : ton would n't hold off forever  --  with or without the United Nations . As proof of their good will , the Soviets on Thursday revealed the private message Gorbachev had sent to Saddam : Withdraw and release the foreigners now , the message said . " We have delayed a Security Council vote as long as we can . " In the message , read out by Soviet charge Sergei Chetveri-kov at the State Department , Gorbachev told Saddam to respond by Friday evening to the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who confirmed Gorbachev 's intent . <p> Shevardnadze called Baker on Friday , Aug. 24 , to say that Saddam 's response had been completely unsatisfactory , " not worth commenting on . " He sounded disgusted . The Soviets were ready to go forward at the United Nations right away , he said . John Bolton , the U.S. assistant secretary for international organizations , told the American U.N . team to keep the Security Council in session for as long as it took to get a resolution approved . At 4 a.m . Saturday , the Security Council voted Resolution 665 , 13 to 0 , with only Yemen and Cuba abstaining . <p> The former cold-war antagonists had a month of joint crisis management behind them . On Aug. 30 , two Soviet officials charged that the Americans were seeking a permanent military foothold in the Middle East . But Bush and Gorbachev were determined to keep relations on track . Bush had already offered a mini-summit in Helsinki . The Soviet leader quickly accepted . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bush works the phone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates approve an embargo <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Baker and Shevardnadze on a fishing trip at Lake Baikal <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Iraqi tanks move on Kuwait , U.S. troops disembark in Saudi Arabia <p> BY MARGARET GARRARDWARNER <p>
