Where you 're supposed to be is some big West Hills wedding reception in a big manor house with flower arrangements and stuffed mushrooms all over the house . This is called scene setting : where everybody is , who 's alive , who 's dead . This is Evie Cottrell 's big wedding reception moment . Evie is standing halfway down the big staircase in the manor house foyer , naked inside what 's left of her wedding dress , still holding her rifle . Me , I 'm standing at the bottom of the stairs but only in a physical way . My mind is , I do n't know where . Nobody 's all-the-way dead yet , but let 's just say the clock is ticking . Not that anybody in this big drama is a real alive person , either . You can trace everything about Evie Cottrell 's look back to some television commercial for an organic shampoo , except right now Evie 's wedding dress is burned down to just the hoopskirt wires orbiting her hips and just the little wire skeletons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Evie 's blonde hair , her big , teased-up , back-combed rainbow in every shade of blonde blown up with hairspray , well , Evie 's hair is burned off , too . The only other character here is Brandy Alexander , who 's laid out , shotgunned , at the bottom of the staircase , bleeding to death . What I tell myself is the gush of red pumping out of Brandy 's bullet hole is less like blood than it 's some sociopolitical tool . The thing about being cloned from all those shampoo commercials , well , that goes for me and Brandy Alexander , too . Shotgunning anybody in this room would be the moral equivalent of killing a car , a vacuum cleaner , a Barbie doll . Erasing a computer disk . Burning a book . Probably that goes for killing anybody in the world . We 're all such products . Brandy Alexander , the long-stemmed latte queen supreme of the top-drawer party girls , Brandy is gushing her insides out through a bullet hole in her amazing suit jacket . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought in Seattle with a tight hobble skirt that squeezes her ass into the perfect big heart shape . You would not believe how much this suit cost . The mark-up is about a zillion percent . The suit jacket has a little peplum skirt and wide lapels and shoulders . The single-breasted cut is symmetrical except for the hole pumping out blood . Then Evie starts to sob , standing there halfway up the staircase . Evie , that deadly virus of the moment . This is our cue to all look at poor Evie , poor , sad Evie , hairless and wearing nothing but ashes and circled by the wire cage of her burned-up hoop skirt . Then Evie drops the rifle . With her dirty face in her dirty hands , Evie sits down and starts to boo-hoo , as if crying will solve anything . The rifle , this is a loaded thirty-aught rifle , it clatters down the stairs and skids out into the middle of the foyer floor , spinning on its side , pointing at me , pointing at Brandy , pointing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some detached lab animal just conditioned to ignore violence , but my first instinct is maybe it 's not too late to dab club soda on the bloodstain . Most of my adult life so far has been me standing on seamless paper for a raft of bucks per hour , wearing clothes and shoes , my hair done and some famous fashion photographer telling me how to feel . Him yelling , Give me lust , baby . Flash . Give me malice . Flash . Give me detached existentialist ennui . Flash . Give me rampant intellectualism as a coping mechanism . Flash . Probably it 's the shock of seeing my one worst enemy shoot my other worst enemy is what it is . Boom , and it 's a win-win situation . This and being around Brandy , I 've developed a pretty big jones for drama . It only looks like I 'm crying when I put a handkerchief up under my veil to breathe through . To filter the air since you can about not breathe for all the smoke since Evie 's big manor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down beside Brandy , I could put my hands anywhere in my gown and find Darvons and Demerols and Darvocet 100s . This is everybody 's cue to look at me . My gown is a knock-off print of the Shroud of Turin , most of it brown and white , draped and cut so the shiny red buttons will button through the stigmata . Then I 'm wearing yards and yards of black organza veil wrapped around my face and studded with little hand-cut Austrian crystal stars . You ca n't tell how I look , face-wise , but that 's the whole idea . The look is elegant and sacrilegious and makes me feel sacred and immoral . Haute couture and getting hauter . Fire inches down the foyer wallpaper . Me , for added set dressing I started the fire . Special effects can go a long way to heighten a mood , and it 's not as if this is a real house . What 's burning down is a re-creation of a period revival house patterned after a copy of a copy of a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations removed from anything original , but the truth is are n't we all ? Just before Evie comes screaming down the stairs and shoots Brandy Alexander , what I did was pour out about a gallon of Chanel Number Five and put a burning wedding invitation to it , and boom , I 'm recycling . It 's funny , but when you think about even the biggest tragic fire it 's just a sustained chemical reaction . The oxidation of Joan of Arc . Still spinning on the floor , the rifle points at me , points at Brandy . Another thing is no matter how much you think you love somebody , you 'll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close . Except for all this high drama , it 's a really nice day . This is a warm , sunny day and the front door is open to the porch and the lawn outside . The fire upstairs draws the warm smell of the fresh-cut lawn into the foyer , and you can hear all the wedding guests outside . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crystal and silver and went out to wait on the lawn for the firemen and paramedics to make their entrance . Brandy , she opens one of her huge , ring-beaded hands and she touches the hole pouring her blood all over the marble floor . Brandy , she says , " Shit . There 's no way the Bon MarchZ will take this suit back . " Evie lifts her face , her face a finger-painting mess of soot and snot and tears from her hands and screams , " I hate my life being so boring ! " Evie screams down at Brandy Alexander , " Save me a window table in hell ! " Tears rinse clean lines down Evie 's cheeks , and she screams , " Girlfriend ! You need to be yelling some back at me ! " As if this is n't already drama , drama , drama , Brandy looks up at me kneeling beside her . Brandy 's aubergine eyes dilated out to full flower , she says , " Brandy Alex-ander is going to die now ? " Evie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle for the spotlight . Just each of us being me , me , me first . The murderer , the victim , the witness , each of us thinks our role is the lead . Probably that goes for anybody in the world . It 's all mirror , mirror on the wall because beauty is power the same way money is power the same way a gun is power . Anymore , when I see the picture of a twenty-something in the newspaper who was abducted and sodomized and robbed and then killed and here 's a front-page picture of her young and smiling , instead of me dwelling on this being a big , sad crime , my gut reaction is , wow , she 'd be really hot if she did n't have such a big honker of a nose . My second reaction is I 'd better have some good head and shoulders shots handy in case I get , you know , abducted and sodomized to death . My third reaction is , well , at least that cuts down on the competition . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspension of inert fetal solids in hydrogenated mineral oil . My point is that , if I 'm honest , my life is all about me . My point is , unless the meter is running and some photographer is yelling : Give me empathy . Then the flash of the strobe . Give me sympathy . Flash . Give me brutal honesty . Flash . " Do n't let me die here on this floor , " Brandy says , and her big hands clutch at me . " My hair , " she says , " My hair will be flat in the back . " My point is I know Brandy is maybe probably going to die , but I just ca n't get into it . Evie sobs even louder . On top of this , the fire sirens from way outside are crowning me queen of Migraine Town . The rifle is still spinning on the floor , but slower and slower . Brandy says , " This is not how Brandy Alexander wanted her life to go . She 's supposed to be famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on television during Super Bowl halftime , drinking a diet cola naked in slow motion before she died . " The rifle stops spinning and points at nobody . At Evie sobbing , Brandy screams , " Shut up ! " " You shut up , " Evie screams back . Behind her , the fire is eating its way down the stairway carpet . The sirens , you can hear them wandering and screaming all over the West Hills . People will just knock each other down to dial 9-1-1 and be the big hero . Nobody looks ready for the big television crew that 's due to arrive any minute . " This is your last chance , honey , " Brandy says , and her blood is getting all over the place . She says , " Do you love me ? " It 's when folks ask questions like this that you lose the spotlight . This is how folks trap you into a best-supporting role . Even bigger than the house being on fire is this huge expectation that I have to say the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just the words make me feel I 'm severely fingering myself . They 're just words is all . Powerless . Vocabulary . Dialogue . " Tell me , " Brandy says . " Do you ? Do you really love me ? " This is the big hammy way Brandy has played her whole life . The Brandy Alexander nonstop continuous live action theater , but less and less live by the moment . Just for a little stage business , I take Brandy 's hand in mine . This is a nice gesture , but then I 'm freaked by the whole threat of blood-borne pathogens , and then , boom , the ceiling in the dining room crashes down and sparks and embers rush out at us from the dining room doorway . " Even if you ca n't love me , then tell me my life , " Brandy says . " A girl ca n't die without her life flashing before her eyes . " Pretty much nobody is getting their emotional needs met . It 's then the fire eats down the stairway carpet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and pounds down the stairs in her burned-up white high heels . Naked and hairless , wearing wire and ashes , Evie Cottrell runs out the front door to a larger audience , her wedding guests , the silver and crystal and the arriving fire trucks . This is the world we live in . Conditions change and we mutate . So of course this 'll be all about Brandy , hosted by me , with guest appearances by Evelyn Cottrell and the deadly AIDS virus . Brandy , Brandy , Brandy . Poor sad Brandy on her back , Brandy touches the hole pouring her life out onto the marble floor and says , " Please . Tell me my life . Tell me how we got here . " So me , I 'm here eating smoke just to document this Brandy Alexander moment . Give me attention . Flash . Give me adoration . Flash . Give me a break . Flash .
