Floyd Beefus was picking a tick off one of the springers when the gas man slipped on a cracked dinner plate on the cellar stairs and went bump , bump , bump , right to the bottom . " Yow ! " went the gas man . The springer jumped but Floyd kept gripping him tight between his knees until he had cracked the tick between his forefinger and thumb , then he limped slowly to the cellar door . <p> The gas man lay in a heap at the bottom . He was a well-fed-looking fellow in a green shirt , green pants , and a little green cap . He was moaning and rubbing his leg . <p> " You hurt yourself ? " called Floyd Beefus . <p> The gas man stared up the stairs at him with a confused look , as if his eyes had gone loose in his head . He was about forty , maybe twenty years younger than Floyd himself . " I think I broke my leg . I need an ambulance . You got a phone ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " He limped back to the springer and let him into the pen in the backyard before he peed on the rug . The springer had picked up the tick when they had been out hunting pheasants that morning . Floyd had thought the frost would have killed the ticks . It was early September and Floyd had a small farm outside of Montville , about twenty miles from Belfast . As he put the springer into his pen , he glanced around at the maples just beginning to turn color under the bright blue sky . Soon it would be hunting season and Floyd might get himself a nice buck . Frieda would appreciate that if she was still with them . After a moment , he went back inside to check on the gas man . <p> " You want an aspirin or maybe a Coca-Cola ? " he called . He understood that the gas man posed a problem but he was n't yet sure how to deal with it . <p> " Jesus , I 'm in pain . You got to call a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head on the bottom step . He had a thick , red face . Floyd Beefus thought the man looked excitable and it made Floyd suck his teeth . <p> " I already told you I do n't have no phone . " Floyd had had a phone but he lost track of the bill and the phone had been temporarily disconnected . Frieda used to take care of all that . Floyd Beefus lowered himself onto the top step and gazed down at the gas man . He guessed he 'd have to step over him if he went into the basement to fetch any of his tools . <p> " Then use a neighbor 's phone . This is an emergency ! " <p> " The nearest neighbor 's two miles : ' said Floyd . " That 'd be Harriet Malcomb in the mobile unit . Course I just call it a trailer . I 'd be surprised if she had a phone . She do n't even have a car . If you 'd done this a week ago , then you would have caught some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday : Mike Prescott , a lawyer from Boston . Sometimes he has parties . I 'd hate to tell you what goes on . " <p> " You can use my car . " <p> " I ca n't drive no more on account of the Dewey . " <p> " Dewey ? " <p> " DWI . " <p> The gas man was staring at him in a way that Floyd Beefus thought bordered on the uncivil . " You sure you do n't want that aspirin ? " added Floyd . " Or maybe a pillow ? " <p> " I ca n't just lie here , " said the gas man , letting the whine grow in his voice . " I could be bleeding internally ! " <p> Floyd scratched the back of his neck . He saw cobwebs on the stairs that would never have been allowed to settle before his wife got sick . " I do n't like to leave Frieda . She 's up in bed He started to say more , then did n't . <p> " Jesus , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a crisis situation ? I 'm a supervisor . I ca n't just lie here in your cellar . I could die here <p> " Oh , you wo n't die : ' said Floyd . He considered the gas man 's excitability . " If you 're a supervisor , how come you 're reading my meter ? " <p> " We 're understaffed . You got to get a doctor ! " <p> Floyd pulled his pocket watch out of the pocket of his dungarees and opened the lid . It was shortly past ten-thirty . <p> " The visiting nurse should be here in a while . She usually shows up a little after lunchtime . Billy , that 's my son , he took the Ford down to Rockland this morning . He said he 'd be back by late afternoon . Had to go to the pharmacy down there . I do n't see why they do n't sell the damn stuff in Belfast . You 'd think bedsores 'd be the same in both places <p> " After lunchtime ? " said the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to stop for the blue plate special out at the Ten-Four Diner . And if they have blueberry pie , she generally takes a slice . She 's a fat old thing . She 'll fix you right up . " <p> " That could be three hours , " said the gas man . <p> " Just about . You want to think again about that aspirin ? " <p> " It upsets my stomach . You have any Tylenol ? " <p> " Nope , " said Floyd . " Course Frieda 's got some morphine . I could give you a shot if you like . I 've become practiced at it The gas man had big blue eyes and Floyd found himself thinking : Googly eyes . <p> " Morphine ? " <p> " The visiting nurse brings it . A month ago Frieda only needed two shots a day . Now she needs four . Loretta , that 's the nurse , she said she 's seen patients taking six and even eight shots before their time 's up . You sure you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more . " <p> The gas man shut his eyes . " I do n't take morphine . Perhaps you could get me a glass of water . And I 'll have some aspirin after all . God , it 'd be just my luck to start puking . " <p> The aspirin was above the bathroom sink . Before getting it , Floyd looked in on Frieda . She was sleeping . Her gray hair was spread out on the pillow around her face . Floyd thought of the tumor in her stomach . It did n't sleep ; it just got bigger . The bedroom was full of medicines and an oxygen tank . It had a sweet hospital smell . Floyd himself had been sleeping in the spare room for six weeks and he still could n't get used to it . He got the aspirin , then went downstairs for the water . One of the springers was barking but he was just being conversational . <p> Floyd had to wash out a glass . Since Frieda had been sick , he and Billy had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come easy . A pot on the stove was still crusted with spaghetti sauce from two nights earlier . <p> Floyd descended the cellar stairs , watching out for the stuff that was on the steps : newspapers and empty Ball jars . He sat down above the gas man and handed him the water and bottle of aspirin . " You married ? " he asked . <p> The gas man pried the top off the bottle of aspirin . " I got a wife , " he said . <p> " Kids ? " <p> " Two . " <p> " I been married forty years , " said Floyd . " We done it right after Frieda finished high school . I did n't graduate myself . Did n't need it back then . " <p> The gas man did n't say anything . He took two aspirin , then took two more . There was sweat on his forehead . Floyd thought his face looked unhealthy but maybe it was the pain . The gas man drank some water , then shut his eyes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gas man opened his eyes . " Sure , I mean , she 's my wife <p> " How 'd you feel if you did n't have her anymore ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Well , if she died or went away . " <p> " She would n't do that . Go away , I mean The gas man 's voice had an impatient edge . <p> " But what if she died ? " <p> " I guess I 'd be surprised . " <p> " Is that all ? Just surprised ? " <p> " Well , she 's thirty-eight . There 's nothing wrong with her . " The man took off his green cap and pushed a hand through his hair . It was dark brown with some gray at the temples . <p> " A car could hit her , " said Floyd . " She could be struck down when crossing the street . It happens all the time . " <p> " She pays attention . She looks both ways . " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then got angry . " Ca n't you see I do n't want to talk ! I hurt and you wo n't even get help ! " <p> Floyd pursed his lips . He sat above the gas man and looked down on his bald spot . " I already explained about that . " He thought how the gas man 's bald spot would get bigger and bigger till it ate up his whole head . " You live around here ? " he asked . <p> " I live in Augusta . " " They got a lot of dangerous streets in Augusta , " said Floyd . " I seen them . " <p> The gas man sighed . <p> " Would n't you mind if your wife was hit by a car ? " <p> " Mind , of course I 'd mind ! Jesus , what are you saying ? " " I 'm just trying to get the picture , " said Floyd . <p> " We got two kids , like I say . They 're both still in school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My two oldest are grown up , " said Floyd . " A daughter in Boston and my older boy in Portland . But they 'd be here in a minute if Frieda got took worse . You sleep with your wife ? " <p> " Of course I sleep with my wife . What are you getting at ? " The gas man turned his head but it was hard to see Floyd seated behind him . Floyd had his arms folded across his knees and was resting his chin on his wrist . <p> " Me and Frieda , we ca n't sleep together no more . At first without her there I could hardly sleep at all . The bed seemed hollow , like it was no more than an empty shoe . She 'd move around a lot in the night and she 'd cry . She 's scared but she wo n't say anything . I would 've stayed right there in the old double bed but the visiting nurse said it would be better if I moved . At first I sat up in <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many nights . Sleeping in the spare room feels like I done something wrong . " <p> The gas man did n't speak for a moment . Then he said , " Can you get me a pillow for my head ? " <p> Floyd got a pillow upstairs from Billy 's room . His knee hurt from walking around the fields that morning and he moved slowly . Frieda was still asleep . He stood a moment in the doorway and watched her breathe . After she exhaled there was a pause that seemed to stretch on and on . Then she would breathe again and Floyd would relax a little . Her skin was the color of old egg cartons . He took the pillow back down to the gas man , who was rubbing his leg below the knee . <p> " I can feel the bone pressing against the skin , " said the as man . " It 's sure to be bleeding inside . I could lose my whole leg He had pulled up the green pant leg and showed Floyd the red bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd put the pillow behind the gas man 's head . " I broke my leg falling off the tractor once . I lay in the field for two hours and no harm was done except for the pain . It 's not like cancer . The body can take a lot <p> " It hurts , " said the gas man . <p> " That 's just your body telling you there 's something wrong . You want me to haul you upstairs and put you on the couch ? " <p> The gas man considered that . When he thought , he moved his tongue around in his mouth . " I think I better stay right here until the rescue squad shows up <p> Floyd was n't sure he could get the gas man up the stairs in any case . " You pray ? " he asked . <p> " I 'm not much for church , " said the gas man . <p> " Me neither , but there 's a Bible around somewheres if you need it . Frieda likes to look at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . Never complained , always kept us going with her jokes . You ever been unfaithful to your wife ? " <p> The gas man 's head jerked on his pillow . <p> " Jesus , what kind of question is that ? " <p> " I just wanted to know <p> " My affairs are none of your business , absolutely none of your business . " <p> Floyd settled himself more comfortably on the step . He was sorry that the gas man was so unforthcoming . " You know Belfast ? " <p> " I been there <p> " You know how it used to have those two chicken processing plants ? Penobscot Poultry and the other one . I forget its name . <p> guy named Mendelsohn run it . Every summer Belfast used to have a poultry festival with rides and activities in the city park . It used to be something special and high school bands would come from all over . And the Shriners , too . " <p> The gas man did n't speak . He began rubbing his leg again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think looked right . <p> " There was a woman who worked upstairs at Penobscot . She had a job putting the little piece of paper between the chicken parts and Styrofoam . Her name was Betsy . My , she liked to make trouble . She was never buttoned clear to the neck . About twelve years ago me and Frieda went to that poultry fair . The kids were young enough to still like it . I was drinking beer . That 's always a mistake with me . After dark I got Betsy back on a tree stump . I was just unbuttoning myself when Frieda found me . Jesus , I already had Betsy 's shorts off under her dancing skirt . " <p> " Why are you telling me this ? " The gas man stretched his neck to get a glimpse of Floyd . <p> " I was just thinking about it , that 's all , " said Floyd . <p> " Do n't you see I do n't care what you 've done ? " <p> " Then what do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to talk at all . " <p> Floyd sat for a moment . The gas man had a fat gold wedding ring , then another ring with a blue stone on his right pinkie finger . He had shiny teeth and Floyd thought it was the kind of mouth that was used to eating a lot , the kind of mouth that enjoyed itself . <p> " How 's your leg ? " asked Floyd . <p> " It hurts . " <p> " That aspirin help any ? " <p> " It makes my stomach queasy . " <p> " You sure you do n't want a Coke ? " <p> " I just want to get out of here . You got to take my car <p> " The Dewey 'd get me for sure , " said Floyd , " and then there 's Frieda . If she woke up , you could n't do anything . " <p> Floyd leaned back with his elbows on a step . The cellar was filled with evidence of forty years in this house : broken chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed for Bouncer , who had been dead fifteen years . The cellar had a musty smell . He wondered what he would do with this stuff when Frieda died . The thought of her death was like a pain in his body . <p> " You ever think , " said Floyd , " that a bad thing happens to you because of some bad thing you 've done ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " asked the gas man suspiciously . <p> " Well , that time I fell off the tractor and broke my leg was right after I 'd been with Betsy at the poultry festival . Even when I fell I had the sense that something was giving me a shove . If I 'd had two more seconds I 'd 've stuck it into her ... " <p> " I do n't want to hear about this , " said the gas man . <p> " What I was wondering is maybe you 've been doing something you should n't . You always play straight with your wife ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never felt temptation ? " <p> " I only wanted to read your meter , " said the gas man . " That 's all , just your meter . " <p> " You 're a better man than I am . I felt temptation . I felt it every time I went into town . It was n't that I do n't love my wife . I was just exercising myself , so to speak . I 'd go into Barbara 's Lunch and just breathe heavily . Going into houses like you do , you must of felt temptation a whole lot . " <p> " I do n't want to talk about it . I 'm a supervisor . " <p> " But younger , when you were a plain gas man . Did n't some woman look at you and smile ? " <p> " Why are you saying this ? " asked the gas man . He spoke so forcefully that little drops of spit exploded from his lips . He tried to turn but could n't quite see Floyd sitting behind him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frieda caught me behind the beer tent with Betsy McCollough , she 'd look at me with such ... disappointment . I do n't mean right at the time . Then she was just angry . But later , at dinner or just walking across the room , she 'd look up at me and I could see the wounding in her face . She still loved me and I loved her , too . It was eleven , almost twelve years later the cancer took hold of her , but I find myself thinking that my time with Betsy had opened the cancer to her . It made a little door for the cancer to enter . " <p> The gas man had his face in his hands . He did n't say anything . The tips of his ears were all red . <p> " We were married right in Montville , " said Floyd . " All our families were there , most of them dead now . We planned to be so happy . Even now , lying in bed , Frieda will look at me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . She does n't regret her marriage or regret having met me . It 's like she thought I was a certain size and then she found out I was a little smaller . And I can never say she 's wrong . I ca n't make myself bigger . When she was first sick , I used to make her dinners and bring her stuff and she appreciated it but it never made me as big a person as she used to think I was . And soon , you know , she 'll be gone , and then I wo n't be able to explain anything or fir anything . All our time will be over . " <p> The gas man did n't say anything . <p> " What d' you think about that ? " asked Floyd . <p> " I just want a doctor : ' said the gas man . <p> " If you 're so good , " said Floyd , " then why wo n't you talk to me about it ? " <p> " About what ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care , " said the gas man . " Do n't you understand it ? I do n't care . " <p> " Fine gas man you are , " said Floyd . He sat without speaking . He rubbed his knee and the gas man rubbed his leg . <p> " I do n't mean to hurt your feelings , " said the gas man . <p> " That 's okay , " said Floyd , " I 'm not worth much . " <p> " It 's not what you 're worth , " said the gas man . " My legs broken . I hurt . I 'm preoccupied . " <p> " You think I 'm not preoccupied ? " said Floyd . " My wife 's dying upstairs and I ca n't do anything about it . I look in her face and I see the memories there . I see how I hurt her and how I said the wrong things and how I got angry and how I was n't the man she hoped I 'd be . I see that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that . You think I 'm not preoccupied ? " <p> The gas man put his cap back on his head and pulled down the brim . " I do n't know what to say . I come into this place . All I want is to read your meter . Why the hell ca n't you keep that stuff off the stairs ? You think it 's nice to be a gas man going into strange basements all the time ? All I want is to get in and get out . Then I go home , eat dinner , watch some TV , and go to bed . Is that too much to ask ? Instead , I slip on a dinner plate and you say I must 've deserved it . I must 've been cheating on my wife . All I want is to get my leg fired . I 'm sorry your wife 's dying . I ca n't do anything about it . I 'm just a gas man . " <p> Floyd leaned back and sighed . He heard one of the springers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen if she needed anything . Apart from the springer , the house was silent except for the gas man 's heavy breathing . Floyd felt dissatisfied somehow , like finishing a big meal and still being hungry . He looked at his watch . It was almost eleven-thirty . <p> " Old Loretta should be reaching the Ten-Four Diner in another hour , " he said . " My , she loves to eat . I 've known her even to have two pieces of pie with ice cream . If they got blueberry and if they got rhubarb , then I bet she 'll have both . " <p> " What 's the latest she 's gotten here ? " <p> " Three o'clock . " <p> The gas man groaned . " I hurt , I hurt a lot . " <p> " There 's still that morphine , " said Floyd . <p> " No morphine , " said the gas man . <p> " Anything else you want ? Maybe a tuna fish sandwich ? " <p> " You got any whiskey ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Maybe a shot of that , maybe a double . " <p> Floyd made his way back upstairs . He was sorry the gas man did n't want a tuna fish sandwich . He wanted to feed him , to have the gas man think well of him . Looking in on Frieda , he saw she had turned her head but that was all . She said the morphine gave her bright-colored dreams . She dreamt about being a kid or going to school or having children again . Rich , vigorous dreams and Floyd Beefus envied her for them . When he went to bed he was just grinding and grinding all night long like a tractor motor . <p> He poured the gas man half a glass of whiskey , then poured himself some as well . Floyd made his way back down the cellar stairs . He handed the gas man the bigger glass . <p> " Here you go , " he said . <p> The gas man gripped it with both hands and took a drink , then he coughed . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supervisor ? " asked Floyd . <p> " Sure . " <p> " What do you like about it ? " <p> " It commands respect . " <p> " You ever fired anybody ? " <p> " Well , sometimes you have to let somebody go <p> " You feel bad about that ? " <p> " I feel my duty is to the company and to the trust they put in me The gas man took another drink . <p> Floyd could n't imagine being a gas man or what it would be like going into people 's houses . He had been a farmer all his life . " You ever stole anything from them ? " <p> The gas man cranked his head around . The whiskey had brought a little color to his nose . " Of course not ! " <p> " Not even a ball-point pen or a couple of paper dips ? " <p> " They trust me . " <p> " How long you worked for the company ? " <p> " Almost twenty-three years . " <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of stuff for them . " <p> " I 've had a wide variety of experience The gas man talked about the sort of things he had done : office work , field work , repairing broken equipment . He finished his whiskey and Floyd gave him another . The gas man took two more aspirins . It was just after twelve o'clock . <p> " You wo n't change your mind about that sandwich ? " <p> " I do n't like tuna fish , " said the gas man . " Maybe some toast with a little butter . Not too brown . " <p> Floyd went back up to the kitchen . The bread had a little mold but he cut it off . He checked the toaster to make sure no mice had gotten electrocuted . Sometimes they crept inside and got caught like lobsters in a trap . Floyd wiped a plate off on his pant leg , then he buttered the toast using a clean knife . Through the kitchen window he saw four cows moseying in a line across the field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd took the toast back down to the gas man . <p> " How many houses can you go into in a single day as a gas man ? " asked Floyd . <p> " Maybe sixty out in the country , double that in the city . " He had his mouth full of toast and he wiped his lips with the back of his hand . <p> " And nothing strange ever happens ? " <p> " In and out , that 's all I want . Sometimes a dog gives you some trouble . I 'm like a shadow in people 's lives . " <p> " And you 've never felt temptation ? " <p> The gas man drank some whiskey . " Absolutely never . " <p> " No women give you the eye ? " <p> " Their lives do n't concern me . It 's their meters I 'm after . " The gas man put the empty plate on the step . He was still chewing slowly , getting a few last crumbs , running his tongue along the gap between his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to get involved . " <p> " But people must talk to you . A woman must give you a friendly look . " <p> " Oh , it 's there all right , " said the gas man . " I could be bad if I wanted . " " You seen things . " <p> " I seen a lot . " <p> " It must be a burden sometimes . " <p> " My duty 's to the gas company , like I say . That 's why they made me supervisor , because I make the right decisions , or try to . They appreciate my loyalty . " <p> " What kind of things have you seen ? " asked Floyd . <p> The gas man drank some more whiskey , then rested the glass on his thigh . " There was a woman in Augusta , a divorcee , who had it in mind to make trouble . I seen that . " <p> " Good-looking ? " <p> " A little thick , but good-looking . This was ten years ago . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas man took off his cap again and wiped his brow . He set his cap carefully on the step beside him . " Well , the first time <p> went by her house she offered me a cup of coffee . I know that does n't sound like much but it was just the beginning . She asked if I wanted a cup of coffee and if I wanted to sit down and rest a little . She was wearing a bathrobe , a cream-colored bathrobe . She had thick brown hair past her shoulders and it was nicely brushed . " <p> " You take the coffee ? " <p> " I always make a point of never taking anything . " <p> " Then what happened ? " <p> " A month later , I went by her house again . She was waiting for me . She followed me down to the basement when I went to read her meter .

" asked Floyd . He liked dancing but he had n't had much occasion in his life . When he was younger , there had been barn dances during the summer and sometimes he still recalled the smell of perfume and hay . <p> " I do n't know if she wanted to dance , " said the gas man . " I did n't think about it . I was in a hurry . " <p> " She must have been lonely . " <p> " A gas man does n't socialize . It 's like being a priest but you deal with meters instead .

She was still wearing her robe and I thought she 'd been drinking a little . She greeted me heartily , like I was an old friend . People have done that before trying to get around me . I just nodded . I go down in the basement and check her meter . When I start back up the basement stairs , she 's standing at the top . She 's taken off her bathrobe and she 's wearing only this pink underwear , pink panties . Her titties are completely bare and she 's pushing them up at me . Big , pink titties . She was blocking the door so I could n't get through . ' Take me , ' she says , like she thinks she 's a cab or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd . <p> " I asked her to get out of my way , that I was in a hurry . She still did n't move . So I yelled at her . I told her I was a busy man and I did n't have time to waste . She took her hands away from her titties pretty quick , I can tell you . I said her behavior was awful and she should be ashamed . " <p> " Then what happened ? " <p> " She stepped aside and I left . " <p> " And the next month ? " <p> " The next month she was gone and the house was shut up . I did n't think much of it but a month later I asked one of her neighbors if she 'd moved . I do n't know why I asked but I kept thinking of her . Maybe it was because the woman seemed crazy . Anyway , the neighbor told me the woman was dead . One morning she just had n't woken up . The neighbor said it was pills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the neighbor who told me that the woman was a divorcee . She said the husband had gotten the kids and married someone else . I do n't know when she died , just sometime during the month . " <p> Floyd finished his whiskey . One of the springers was barking again . Floyd thought that no woman in his entire life had ever looked at him and said , " Take me , " not even his wife . " You could have kept her alive , " he said . <p> " What d' you mean ? " <p> " You could have talked to her . She might still be around <p> " She wanted sex . She was crazy . " <p> " But you could have talked to her . She probably only wanted a little conversation . " <p> " That 's not my job . To me , she was only a person with a gas meter . In and out , like I say . " <p> " What if you 'd found her bleeding on the floor ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But the stuff she told you , it was like she was bleeding .

" I would 've danced with her . I would 've danced till my feet fell off . " <p> " We already know about you , " said the gas man . " You and that woman behind the beer tent . " <p> " You as good as killed her , " said Floyd . He felt angry but he knew that only a piece of his anger was connected to the gas man . The rest seemed a blanket over everything else . He did n't like the whole setup : people coming into and going out of this life and none of it being by choice . <p> Floyd heard Frieda 's buzzer and he got to his feet . He felt dizzy from the whiskey . He made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying something but Floyd did n't pay any mind . <p> Frieda 's eyes were only half-open . " I would like some more water . " Her voice was very soft . <p> Floyd got the water from the kitchen and put in a couple of cubes office . When he handed it to Frieda , he said , " There 's a real jerk in the basement . " <p> " Tell him to go away . " <p> " I ca n't . He 's broken his leg . " <p> Frieda nodded solemnly . The morphine and her approaching death made her more accepting of the world 's peculiarities . <p> " Then give him something to eat . " <p> " I already did . " <p> " Then just bear with it , " she said . <p> When Floyd looked back down the basement stairs , he saw the gas man was holding his head in his hands . " More aspirin ?
