IN A SMALL THREE-ROOM APARTMENT in Hanoi 's already crumbling New Quarter , Vietnam 's most famous living author sits in a sweaty white shirt and dark blue polyester pants , his feet bare . Outside , most of Hanoi is celebrating Reunification Day . Giant posters glorify Ho Chi Minh and the 1954 defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu . The bright red national flag hangs above shop doors . Fireworks sound over Small Lake . In years past , Bao Ninh used to spend this day with the surviving members of his unit . " Not now , " he says . " We 've had enough of it . " <P> So has almost everyone else . Nineteen years after the fall of Saigon , it is not easy to persuade readers anywhere in the world to revisit the Vietnam War . That was the problem British literary agent Gill Coleridge faced when she tried to sell the rights to Ninh 's Sorrow of War to American publishers in &; 1992 . " They all turned it down , " says Coleridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be told how badly we behaved in Vietnam . ' " <P> Now they wish they had not been so hasty . Since it first appeared in English last January , Ninh 's book has gained a cult following in Europe and Asia . It has been reprinted six times in Britain , where in May it received the daily Independent 's 1994 foreign-fiction award . Sorrow of War appeared on the shelves in Sweden in April . It will go on sale in France , Norway and Italy later this year and in Denmark , Germany , the Netherlands , Poland and the U.S. next year . The English version is already available across Asia but is hard to find . Ninh , who is writing his next novel on the war , will receive half the $15,200 Independent prize money but little more . He still supports his wife and child with odd jobs . But , he insists he " did n't write it for money . " <P> First published four years ago in Vietnamese under the ideologically more positive title A Fight of Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North Vietnamese army ever to appear in Vietnam . " It is my vision of war , " says Ninh , 42 . " I wanted to show that this army that is glorified by other writers is not something holy or sacred , but had many evils . " <P> Much like Sorrow 's central character , Kien , Ninh put his thoughts and experiences on paper long after the war 's end . Though the author says his tale " is pure fiction , " there are other similarities . Both writer and character are decorated soldiers in the NVA 's 27th Youth Brigade . Each is among the unit 's 500 conscripts who enter the war in the bloody Central Highlands  --  and one of only nine survivors by the time the unit becomes the first to march into Saigon in 1975 . After he was demobilized in 1976 , Ninh tried university for a while and then quit to live as Kien does , " like a wanderer , jobless " for years . Says Ninh : " My war experience always haunted me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the day I started , sometime in 1985 . " <P> Kien takes over from there . The fictional author forces the reader and himself through a " parade of memories " that " push upstream like a sampan toward the past . " Some are gentle , as when his squad mistakenly receives a shipment of bras and side-button pants . Others are stark , as when he collapses drunk at Saigon airport at war 's end and wakes up next to a dead , naked prostitute .
