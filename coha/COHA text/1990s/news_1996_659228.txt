The Next Generation Of Cameras Is Here <p> Business Extra Newspaper 's nameplate <p> Text : <p> By EVAN RAMSTAD <p> AP Business Writer <p> Dick Jones has seen plenty of disasters at his photo supply and finishing store in Santa Fe , N.M. , over the past 30 years . <p> Misthreaded film . Double exposures . Too much light or not enough . Wrong speed setting . And that 's before cutting off Uncle Dan 's head or Grandma Martha 's good side in the picture . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including myself , " said Jones . " That was just one of the things that we grew to accept . " <p> No more . On Monday , in a rare display of cooperation , the world 's largest photo companies - Kodak , Canon , Fuji , Minolta and Nikon - will begin selling specially-designed films and cameras that are supposed to be harder to mess up . <p> While each manufacturer has given the products a particular brand name , collectively they will be known as the Advanced Photo System . They are aimed at casual photographers , the point-and-snap crowd that every year takes 17 billion pictures in the United States alone . <p> The main change is in the use of narrower film , 24 millimeters instead of 35 millimeters , placed in a self-winding cartridge and made with a magnetic coating to store digital data . Some of the cameras will have computer chips that keep track of the date and time and technical things like light sensitivity , and embed that information in the magnetic portion of the film . <p> Photographers will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single roll . <p> The photo companies hope the new cameras give them a much-needed boost in sales . Picture-taking by American consumers peaked in 1990 , fell during the recession and has recovered only marginally since . <p> Photo company executives and market researchers are particularly concerned about a dropoff in photo hobbyists . Young people who might become interested in photography have alternatives in video and computers now . <p> " In 1991 , the early signs of market saturation were occurring , " said Bill Smith , director of marketing for Advanced Photo System products at Eastman Kodak Co . " From an overall industry health standpoint , we knew we had to do something to reinvigorate the industry . " <p> The top camera makers worked for several years on the technical specifications behind the new products . Dozens of other companies licensed those ideas and will also bring out their own products under the APS umbrella starting Monday . <p> " Most of the features we 're seeing on these initial cameras are using a very minor part of the technology available to the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the third and fourth generation cameras , we 're going to see some of the real potential come out . " <p> With the smaller film , cameras can also be smaller . Some will fit in a shirt pocket . Prices will range from $ 50 to more than $ 500 . <p> New products traditionally spark consumer interest in picture-taking . Photo finishing volume grew 20 percent the year after small Instamatic cameras with 126-film cartridges were introduced in the mid-1960s , for instance . There were surges again when 110 cartridges came out in the early 1970s and when 35 millimeter cameras became simpler to use a few years later . <p> Jonathan Rosenzweig , photography industry analyst at Salomon Brothers , said the APS products will probably produce the same buying pattern . <p> " Whenever you have the entire industry behind something , it 's bound to result in increased enthusiasm right away , " he said . " Hopefully , that is followed by some long-term incremental growth in sales . " <p> The first hurdle for the new products will be having enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastman Kodak 's labs around the country will be able to handle the APS film right away . <p> In many major cities , some one-hour photo shops have spent the $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 on new equipment to develop APS film . But there are 10,000 one-hour photo labs in the country and it will take time for them all to have APS developing . <p> Karen Stollar , manager at O'Brien 's Photo Center and Sound Room in Marietta , Ohio , said her store will have to send such film out for developing . That may deter usage of the cameras in her area for a time . <p> " The world is fast-moving now and everybody wants film back in an hour , " Stollar said . But she plans to have some APS cameras on hand as soon as she can because some customers have already asked about them . <p> BLOCK 2 <p> The Advanced Photo System is the most significant change in camera and film design since disc film was introduced more than a decade ago . <p> It combines new ideas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and film that is easier to load and manage after it 's been developed . <p> Key Features <p> - Film cartridge thrusts film into position automatically , relieving photographers of the worry that they threaded film the wrong way and are not actually capturing the pictures they take . <p> - Picture format can be changed during a roll of film . Many of the cameras will make images in three formats , the standard 2x3 ratio , a movie screen-like 9x16 ratio and the 1x3 ratio used in panoramic cameras . Some critics complain the panoramic effect is achieved by cropping the top and bottom of the normal image rather than by broadening the view of the camera . <p> - Negative remains in the cartridge after it 's been developed . This keeps the negative clean and makes it easier to store . An index print , a card with miniature pictures of the entire roll , comes back with the prints and the negative in the cartridge . When a reprint or enlargement is desired , a person takes the whole cartridge back to the developer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording digital data from the camera . Initially , that will result in some information , such as date and time , automatically being printed on the back of a photo . Some cameras will allow people to inscribe a title and some will measure the brightness of a scene so reprints or enlargements can be consistent with the original . <p> - New kinds of accessories are being introduced to work with the film cartridges . For instance , Fujifilm will immediately sell a $ 500 device that scans the negatives into a personal computer . <p> - Cameras will generally be smaller . Some will fit in shirt pockets . <p> BLOCK 3 <p> Some tradeoffs <p> - Higher cost for developing . Though pricing is not official , the cost of developing and printing an APS roll may be 10 percent to 50 percent higher than a 35mm roll with the same number of exposures . <p> - No black-and-white or slide film will be made for Advanced Photo System cameras . Single-use cameras , which have become popular in the past few years , will be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be available in most places for some time . Photo finishers have been buying the equipment to process the new film . But many small stores will send the film out for next-day delivery until they get the machines themselves . <p> - Enlargements over 11x14 are not advised . The film is 24mm instead of 35mm , producing images that are less precise . The difference is noticeable on regular-sized prints to discerning photographers but becomes plain to the casual viewer on prints larger than 11x14 . <p> End Adv for use anytime
