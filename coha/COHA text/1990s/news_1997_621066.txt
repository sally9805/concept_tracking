<p> Unless they live smack-dab in the middle of the vineyards of Livermore Valley , most people discover the East Bay 's wine country one way : They hear it through the grapevine . <p> Ed and Deanna Gower , who live behind Fenestra Winery in Livermore , stopped by the tasting room of nearby Cedar Mountain Winery recently . She recalled introducing their backyard wine country to her parents , who live in San Leandro . " When they came out to visit us , they said , ' We never knew this was out here ! ' " <p> Rebecca and Raymond Tromater , who come from President Clinton 's birthplace of Hope , Ark. , thought they might go to Napa Valley when they were in the Bay Area for a librarians ' conference two weekends ago . Instead , they ended up at Wente Vineyards Visitors Center off Arroyo Road in Livermore . <p> " The gentleman in the third seat on the plane , who 's the chief financial officer of a high-tech company in Santa Clara , said we should go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of Wente Vineyards , formerly called Wente Brothers and still the area 's biggest producer , are frequently unaware of the more than a dozen other vintners clustered like grapes in Livermore , Castro Valley and Sunol . Those predominantly family-run operations started winemaking in the past 20 years , although some , like Thomas Coyne Winery in Livermore and Elliston Vineyards in Sunol , located themselves on historic estates that produced wine more than 100 years ago . <p> The family-run Concannon Vineyard and Wente have operated continuously for the last century , with reminders of the past proudly retained . At Wente 's visitors center sparkling wine is still stored in hillside caves dug by Chinese laborers in the 1890s , after work on the railroads was finished . <p> Nearly every winery has an " award-winning " wine , whether from regional , state or national competitions , but the winegrowers are also quick to point out that the first California wine to win an international gold medal did n't come from Napa . Charles Wetmore 's Cresta Blanca winery , now the Wente visitors center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Phil Grubstick , an engineer for the city of Oakland who lives in Danville , says he prefers the valley 's wine country to Napa and Sonoma . <p> " There 's absolutely no traffic . This is so relaxed , " he said , surveying the rolling hills and empty roads on a Sunday afternoon . Of course , Napa does have 258 wineries , according to the Napa Vintners Association 's most recent count , compared to 16 in Livermore . <p> The traffic will increase significantly next weekend , when the Livermore Valley Winegrowers Association holds its 16th annual Harvest Wine Celebration . On August 31 and September 1 , shuttle buses will help carry some of the 5,000 to 6,000 visitors expected each day to the 15 participating wineries , which will have music , food , arts and crafts . <p> Mike Witham of Dublin , who goes wine tasting in the valley with wife Diana three or four times a year , said he particularly enjoys the shuttle-bus tour . " You can get on it and shamble off , " he joked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastings . " This is better because Napa is getting so commercialized , " she said . " People are charging $ 3 to $ 5 for tasting there . " <p> Peter Swift has worked in the tasting room at Cedar Mountain for two years and at Wente down Tesla Road for the previous seven years . The number of local visitors is on the rise , he noted with approval . <p> " We get more and more people from Danville , Walnut Creek , Pleasanton and San Jose , and the occasional person who lived in Livermore all their lives and had no idea this was here , " Swift said . <p> The Livermore Valley Winegrowers Association reported approximately 350,000 visitors last year . That number should continue to grow , as more boutique wineries open  --  the latest , Garre Winery , will have a tent at the harvest festival  --  and another major player , Bonny Doon , moves in from Santa Cruz . The latter plans to open a wine facility in 1999 in Pleasanton 's Ruby Hills area , a Bonny Doon representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial interest in a number of the valley 's wineries , the city of Livermore strongly supports cultivating the area as a wine country destination . <p> " We 're one of the few cities in the Bay Area that sees viticulture and agriculture as part of our economic development , " said Karen Majors of the Livermore Office of Economic Development . " It brings tourism in , and it 's also something that generates quality of life . People want to live where there 's open space . " <p> That may seem like a contradiction  --  people living where there 's open space  --  but not according to the South Valley Livermore Area Plan , which will go before the Livermore City Council in September , Majors said . The plan calls for setting aside a certain amount of land for permanent agricultural use , such as vineyards or olive orchards , each time residential development occurs . <p> " Already 800 to 1,000 acres have been protected in the last two years , and the plan has n't even been adopted yet , " Majors said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , which grants those who donate land to the trust easements to grow grapes or other crops , Majors said . <p> That suits winemakers like Earl and Linda Ault , owners of Cedar Mountain , just fine . " They can grow what they want , " he said . <p> " They 're just not going to grow houses , " she added . <p> TOURING THE LIVERMORE VALLEY WINE COUNTRY <p> . <p> CASTRO VALLEY <p> Chouinard Winery <p> 33853 Palomares Road , ( 510 ) 582-9900 <p> Winemaker : Damian Chouinard . <p> Ambience : Attic treasure .
