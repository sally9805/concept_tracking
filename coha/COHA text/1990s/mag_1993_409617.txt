How bad is it for Robby Deboer ? Groping for the right analogy , Robby  --  no one has called her Roberta for years  --  seizes on the other terrible moment in her life : the lingering death of her father , to whom she was close . " I tried to grasp every moment and just enjoy every bit of time because we never knew when he would die , " recalls Robby , sitting in her living room in Ann Arbor , Mich . " We just knew it would be relatively soon . " But what is happening to her now , she says , is much worse . On July 2 the Michigan Supreme Court ordered Robby , 35 , and her husband , Jan , 40 , to give up their only child . Specifically , the DeBoers were ordered to return their 2-1/2-year-old daughter , Jessica , whom they have raised since birth , to the girl 's biological parents , Dan and Cara Schmidt of Blairstown , Iowa . The court said that the child must be returned by Aug. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours and mark a day off on the calendar , " says Robby . Then she breaks down sobbing : " It 's like asking somebody to go with a little child into the Black Forest and walk away . " For the Schmidts , of course , the decision was more like a Grimm 's fairy tale with a happy ending , in which the justice system had at last righted a wrong . After more than two years of bitter wrangling , they were finally going to be reunited with their natural daughter , whom they call Anna . When the 6 to 1 decision came down , Dan , 41 , a truck driver , was making a delivery at a store . A stranger came up and offered congratulations . Dan at first thought the woman was referring to the fact that Cara , 30 , had recently given birth to a baby girl , Chloe . Learning what had happened , he raced home , crying all the way . " Cara met me at the door , " he later told reporters , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both at a loss for words , we were both so overwhelmed . " For all the emotion that it unleashed , the ruling did n't come as a great surprise . In its essence , the case provided a distinctly modern twist on the old debate over which influence should be taken more seriously in life , nature or nurture . Which parents were entitled to this little girl : those whose blood flowed in her veins or those who had nursed her through the darkest nights of early childhood ? As it turns out , legal precedents in most states put the rights of biological parents before those of the child or other caretakers . The judges were not obliged to consider the " best interest of the child "  --  which did not , however , prevent the majority from demanding that the embattled couples do so . " It is now time for the adults to move beyond saying that their only concern is the welfare of the child , " wrote the court , " and to put those words into action . " The DeBoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolstered by scores of supporters in Michigan and Iowa who were appalled by the decision . Almost immediately the ad hoc JUSTICE FOR JESSI groups began organizing a July 10 bus trip to Washington , where they plan to demonstrate on the steps of the Supreme Court . Meanwhile , the victory for the Schmidts was hailed with delight by groups supporting the rights of biological parents . The DeBoers understand that their chance of getting the court to reconsider the case in light of Jessi 's welfare is small , so they have begun preparing for the worst . As much as they can , Robby and Jan try to conceal their mounting anguish from Jessi and to keep their lives as normal as possible . " You ca n't do anything but go out and play on the swing when she says , " I got ta go play ' ' , " says Robby . " You ca n't say , " No , I 'm having a mental breakdown here . ' ' " Nor have they attempted to explain the situation to her . " Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Robby . Soon , however , they must begin to gently break the news . " We 're definitely going to explain everything to her , " Jan recently told reporters . " But we want to be very careful about how this is introduced . It 's a very big parcel , and it must be delivered carefully . " That wo n't be easy , especially since both sides can make passionate and persuasive arguments to support their cases . It all started simply enough . On Feb. 8 , 1991 , Cara Clausen , who was then single , gave birth to a baby girl in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . Having decided that she could not raise a child on her own , she had arranged , through a lawyer , for the baby 's adoption by the DeBoers , who had been desperately trying to adopt for several years . At a routine court hearing on Feb. 25 , a judge was given Cara 's signed release of parental rights . He also received a similar document from Scott Seefeldt , whom Cara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed in order , the judge summarily severed their parental rights . The elated DeBoers returned to Ann Arbor and began settling into what looked to be a happy domestic life , Jan working as a printer and Robby caring for little Jessi . But within days , everything started to come undone . In a sudden change of heart , Cara announced that she now wanted the baby after all . More important , it also turned out that she had lied about the child 's paternity . The real father was Dan Schmidt , with whom she had broken up months before . Cara 's parental rights had been severed , but Dan 's had not  --  and he now wanted custody of the little girl . Dan and Cara were also talking reconciliation . The DeBoers , who because of the dispute were never able to finalize the adoption , fought back in the courts , arguing that they should not be penalized for Cara 's erratic actions . And thus began the tortuous path through the legal system . But if both sides could muster convincing arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critics of the DeBoers asked why , once they knew that the biological mother and father wanted their child back , they had n't spared everyone such anguish by returning her promptly . Robby maintains that when she and Jan checked with child welfare officials , they were told that because Cara 's parental rights had been lawfully severed , Jessica would have at least temporarily been placed in foster care . " I do n't believe in foster care , " Robby says . " I think it 's a lousy excuse in our system for taking care of children . " And , says Robby , by the time the Iowa courts had reinstated Cara 's rights , which took place earlier this year , any transfer of Jessica would have been too disruptive . As for Dan 's parental rights , the DeBoers insist that they were genuinely dubious about his commitment to either Cara or the baby . He had already neglected a daughter , Amanda , 13 , whom he had also fathered out of wedlock . As for Cara , " I did not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , though , Dan and Cara did get married , in April 1992 , and they did have Chloe in June . And to outward appearances at any rate , they live a modest and ordinary life in Blairstown . As Dan told reporters , " I 'm glad my family 's going to be united . We can go on like a normal family , do our daily thing and be happy . " Yet neighbors in and around tiny Blairstown , located 30 miles from Cedar Rapids , did not universally share that joy . Many grumbled , if only privately , that the Schmidts were not necessarily the best candidates for parenthood . One of the harshest critics was Barbara Schlicht , a former girlfriend of Dan 's , who is also the mother of Amanda . Since her birth , Dan has had virtually no contact with Amanda , despite the fact that she and her mother live in Cedar Rapids . In Barbara 's view , the Michigan decision amounted to " court-sanctioned child abuse . " " He wants that child back and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he does n't care a rat 's butt about Amanda . " Just how much trauma Jessi will experience is open to debate . No one doubts that she will suffer some immediate disruption . The DeBoers and their supporters contend that the possible effects of being taken from the only parents she has ever known could range from short-term problems like nightmares to more profound complications such as a deep-seated insecurity . " This little girl is losing everything she is familiar with , " says Dr. Elissa Benedek , a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Michigan . " Her parents , her room , many of her favorite toys and even her name . It is an absolute tragedy for Jessica . " Yet Joe Soll , a psychotherapist and director of the Council for Equal Rights in Adoption , which supports the rights of biological parents , insists that if you want to talk long-term problems , nothing can match the lifelong pain that adopted children often feel . " The impact of the separation of mother and child is tremendous and severe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had this problem since I was born . I had a good home , but the separation leaves a mark down to one 's toes  --  one 's self-esteem is damaged , one 's ability to function in the world . " To help ease what seems to be the inevitable transfer of their little girl , the DeBoers have agreed to allow the Schmidts some visitation privileges with Jessi before the deadline . At first they were reluctant to do so . " If we give visitations , " says Robby , " it only helps Jessi to feel more deceived by us when we finally walk away . " Their wariness increased after a tense encounter with Jessi 's biological grandmothers , Earlene Clausen and Mary Dickinson , who had shown up unannounced in Ann Arbor last month . " They came to our house and demanded to see Jessi , " says Robby , who initially refused . A day and half later , though , she called them and invited them over to get acquainted . The six-hour meeting , during which the DeBoers allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best awkward . " We just showed pictures , " says Robby . The session ended on an especially sour note . As the two grandmothers were preparing to leave , recalls Robby , " Earlene said , " Take good care of our little baby . ' ' " Furious , Robby recalls that she shot back , " Do n't you think we 've done a good job for the past 2-1/2 years ? " Despite the rancor , the two sides were moving last week toward an agreement on visitation for the Schmidts . Robby says that , starting on the weekend of July 17 , Dan and Cara may be allowed to see Jessica for one-hour periods , " depending on how Jan and I are coping . " If successful , more meetings would be scheduled for the following weekend . Cara was planning to arrive in Ann Arbor last week and stay through the actual transfer , with Dan commuting in when possible . How exactly the transfer will take place is still a touchy issue . The DeBoers insist they be allowed to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people who are strangers to her . The Schmidts , meanwhile , want to be allowed to pick up their daughter in Ann Arbor . Perhaps the most ticklish remaining issue is whether the DeBoers will be permitted any contact with Jessica in the months or years to come . Some experts suggest that such contact might be useful . " The more often Jessica is able to see the DeBoers , the better off she is likely to be , " says psychiatrist Benedek . " Hopefully something can be worked out through counseling and mediation between both sets of parents . " But Robby , for one , is not convinced visitation will be best for either Jessica or the DeBoers . " In reality , what Jessi needs is to be monitored through life , " she says , " so that she understands that a hole exists and that people can help her carry that burden . " It is a burden the DeBoers will also carry . Standing in their living room last week , their last moments with Jessica slipping away , Robby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to let go . " The pain just pierces , " says Robby , choking back the tears . " But I 'd do anything for Jessica . " <p>
