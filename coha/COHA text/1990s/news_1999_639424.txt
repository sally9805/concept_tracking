<p> This is the time of year when the cold spots in a house start making themselves known again . <p> The sun porch with the single-pane windows . The family room with the fireplace that extracts more heat than it contributes . The kitchen overhang with the freezing floorboards . <p> But before heading out in search of the usual quick fix - a space heater - homeowners would be wise to consider alternative ways of taking the chill off . <p> As Larry Jaramillo of Public Service Company of Colorado pointed out , electric space heaters are expensive and inefficient compared to other means of solving the problem . <p> ' For a 1,500-watt heater , you 're talking about 10 cents an hour to run it , so if it 's on 10 hours a day , you 're looking at $ 30 a month extra for heating , and that 's a lot , ' he said . <p> Moreover , while natural gas heaters and fireplace inserts might be more efficient because they can heat a larger area , Jaramillo said they cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount that could easily double one 's utility bills over the course of the winter . <p> Rather than bringing in more heat , he suggested , homeowners should first try to warm things up by keeping heat from escaping or simply going unused . Designers also suggest rethinking the room 's furniture placement and color scheme , both of which can make a room feel colder than it really is . <p> First , the simple stuff . To start with , make sure the ceiling fan is set to run so that the leading edge of the blade is lower than the trailing edge . That pulls hot air from the ceiling and mushrooms it down the walls , Jaramillo said . ' If it 's set in reverse , you 'll feel a draft . ' <p> Then , at night , adjust the window blinds so that the upper edge of each slat is facing inside , ' so that as heat rises it gets diverted back into the room , ' he said . ' If it 's turned the other way , the heat goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass is so cold . ' <p> Next , check to make sure the heat registers are unobstructed by furniture , curtains or other obstacles . If a floor outlet is under a window with floor-to-ceiling drapes , put an inexpensive plastic deflector over the grid to send the heat out into the room rather than up the wall . <p> It 's also important to make sure the return-air vent - which is usually installed low on a wall - is not blocked by a sofa , desk or bookcase . ' If you do n't have enough air going back to the furnace , you 're not going to get enough out , because it 's a continuous cycle , ' Jaramillo said . <p> As part of this process , it also makes sense to change the furnace filter . Jaramillo recommended that the filter be replaced three times during the heating season - around the first of October , first of December and first of February - ' and if you have air conditioning , it 's important to change it in the summer , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the filter is more likely to get clogged . ' <p> Finally , the furnace should be professionally inspected every two to three years to make sure it 's operating efficiently . ' If it 's not properly adjusted , ' Jaramillo said , ' you wo n't be getting as much heat as you should . ' <p> Sometimes solving the problem requires nothing more than reworking the decor . You can make a chilly room feel warmer by using certain colors , fabrics and other ' hot ' design touches , designers say . <p> ' One of the things that can make a room feel cold is when it feels a little large , ' said James Martin of The Color People , the firm that created the warm and comfy atmospheres in Dixons and Racines restaurants . <p> ' To bring it in a little and make it feel more intimate , you want to use warm , red- or yellow-based colors and darker tones , ' he said . ' Cool colors , which could be blues , whites and greens , can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown and purple also feel richer and warmer than other options . <p> In addition , Martin said , a room that feels cool ' may be too sparsely furnished ' or too full of contrasts between light and dark . To improve the appearance , break up the space with wall decorations and replace bright halogen lights with smaller lamps . Also , ' if you have a bright white shade on your lamp and replace it with a tan one , it will feel warmer , ' he noted . <p> Furniture upholstered in nubby fabrics also is warmer than leather or shiny poplin , and chenille throws can add warmth , added Jo Frank of the Denver Design Center . <p> Now , the do-it-yourself stuff . Caulking or weatherstripping should be used to seal ' any penetration from outside to inside , ' ranging from cracks between walls and window frames to holes where telephone lines or antenna cables are brought in , Jaramillo said . Hardware stores even sell insulating gaskets for electrical outlets , easily installed under the plastic plates . <p> Jaramillo estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes of caulking at a cost of $ 2 to $ 3 a tube , for a total of less than $ 25 . <p> Cracks between sliding doors or double-hung windows can be plugged with inexpensive ' ropes ' of plastic foam . Drafty windows , especially those with crank-out metal frames , can be sealed with sheets of clear plastic film or easy-to-make interior storm windows that create a dead space between the two panes . <p> Double-paned windows and insulated Roman shades are more effective at keeping out cold air , of course . But they 're also more expensive , and installation requires some skill . <p> Another frequent source of cold air , a leaky fireplace damper , can be detected by blowing out a match and watching to see where the smoke goes . If it ca n't be tightened , glass doors will help keep the unit from stealing heat from the room . <p> But the main culprit in a chilly room , Jaramillo said , is usually a lack of insulation in the ceiling , walls or floor . <p> ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family room in a tri-level , a lot of times it 's because it 's on a cement slab , ' he said . ' If there 's a crawl space underneath , it 's really important to make sure you have insulation around the foundation and plastic on the ground inside as a moisture barrier . ' <p> Such insulation can be stapled to the wooden joists atop the foundation and simply allowed to hang down the walls , at a cost of $ 200 to $ 400 depending on the size of the dwelling , he estimated . <p> Installing insulation in the attic or exterior walls can be more tricky , but it 's just as important . ' In terms of comfort and payback , you 'll get more value out of insulating your attic than anything else you can do in your home , and it 'll be cooler in the summertime too , ' Jaramillo said . <p> In the Denver area , ceiling insulation should have a rating of R-30 at a minimum and preferably R-38 ; walls should be rated at R-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a 1,000-square-foot ranch-style home or bungalow could be properly insulated for about $ 500 , Jaramillo estimated . But before homeowners consider such improvements , he recommends they sign up for a $ 99 ' comfort audit ' from Public Service to determine what kind and how much should be installed . ( A more thorough , whole-house energy audit is also available for $ 179 ; for information , call 303-571-3434 . ) Low-income homeowners can get weatherstripping and insulation installed at no cost through the Energy Saving Partners Program , a statewide effort funded by Public Service Co. , the Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation and the federal government . To be eligible , your income must be about $ 24,000 a year for a family of five . For information , call 1-888-432-8546.
