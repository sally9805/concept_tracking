THE HUNTERS FOUND THEIR quarry right where he was meant to be , the place he had picked with the same care he brought to his other handiwork . Lincoln , Montana , sits as close as you can get to the spine of the western hemisphere and still have a post office and a library within walking distance . Theodore John Kaczynski lived at heaven 's back door , just below the largest stretch of unbroken wilderness in the continental U.S. There are no cars , no roads , no buildings beyond a shelter or two , and on any given day more grizzly bears than people . This is America as the explorers found it , still sealed , unlit , unwired , resembling most perfectly the place the Unabomber wanted America to be . <P> Maybe it was n't really so lonely at night in the woods at the edge of the Scapegoat Wilderness , where the trees sound like a crowd waiting for the curtain to rise . It is a place where a man who hates technology and progress and people would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could listen to the forest rustle and hum , the larches and ponderosa pines hundreds of years old , hundreds of feet high , the tamaracks and the lodgepoles that totter when the wind rubs up against the Continental Divide . What he did n't know was that for the past few weeks , the trees were listening back . <P> The agents were everywhere , disguised as lumberjacks and postal workers and mountain men . They had draped the forest with sensors and microphones , nestled snipers not far from the cabin , even summoned satellites to keep watch for a man practicing blowing things up . When they raided the mountain cabin last week , ending the longest , most expensive hunt for a serial killer in U.S. history , the agents finally got to look into the shaggy face of a man they had imagined and profiled and tracked like a grizzly for the past 18 years . <P> They restrained themselves from saying they had finally caught the Unabomber . After 200 suspects , thousands of interviews , visits with clairvoyants , 20,000 calls to 800-701-BOMB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when they finally , carefully entered the cabin , fearing booby traps , they found a whole bomb factory , including a partially built pipe bomb , chemicals , wire , books on bombmaking and hand-drawn diagrams . The cache even included components bearing , a source told TIME , the unique signature of the Unabomber . ( Every bombmaker , experts say , develops a hallmark : he may loop wires in a certain way , or set his switches at a certain angle or , in this case , create his contraptions out of wood . ) On Friday , a law officer said , investigators defused a live bomb found in the cabin .
