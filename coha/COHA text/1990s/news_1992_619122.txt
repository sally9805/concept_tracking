<p> THE STORY on Los Angeles restaurants these days , according to Los Angeles Times food editor Ruth Reichl , is that they survive during the week but thrive on weekends , except for new places , which stay full until everyone has tried them . This experience certainly was borne out on my recent visit and , frankly , I was a little shocked . Somehow I thought that our entertainment- rich southern neighbor would somehow not be affected by the consumer slump . But it was  --  except for Wolfgang Puck 's hot new place in Malibu , Granita , which is as impossible to get into as any of his other restaurants . <p> GRANITA <p> Granita is the hit of Southern California . Located in the new Malibu Colony Plaza shopping center a few yards from the beach , the large restaurant shimmers and gleams from the moment you set foot on the wavy marble mosaic pavement out front.The interior is meant to look like an underwater cave inhabited by strange fishlike Maurice Sendak creatures , with fluttery lighting bouncing off sparkling materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , Sharon Gless . A lot of very young women were nibbling with a lot of older men . The place roars . <p> The hard-working cooks showcased in a colorfully tiled open kitchen turned out some very tasty if wildly eclectic dishes , many of which are familiar if you 've eaten the French/Chinese creations at Chinois on Main in Santa Monica , or at Postrio here . We had a crisp potato cake ( $ 14 ) slathered with gravlax , dill cream and salmon caviar ; fabulous lobster spring rolls ( $ 11.50 ) on top of a pile of tiny greens and vegetables in a sweet and sour vinaigrette ; and sweetly and darkly glazed quail ( $ 14 ) served with cubes of fried apple . For main courses , a dramatic and luscious Mediterranean fish soup ( $ 24 ) was presented in a huge , flat bowl with a whole scorpion fish , a half lobster and couscous . This firm , sweet-fleshed , little-used scorpion fish ( $ 22 ) also was available baked en papillote with shiitake mushrooms , to excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who used to hold that position at Larkspur 's Lark Creek Inn , is doing even better work in Malibu . The restaurant 's signature dessert , granita , crystals of fresh fruit ice , is the perfect ending for these wild meals . A granita of pomegranate over lemon gelato ( $ 6.50 ) is magnificently refreshing , as is the highly constructed tangerine granita with vanilla ice cream ( $ 6.50 ) . You really have n't done Los Angeles until you 've figured out how to get into a Puck restaurant . <p> Granita , in the Malibu Colony Plaza , 23725 West Malibu Road , Malibu . Open for lunch Wednesday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. ; for dinner Monday through Wednesday from 6 to 10:30 p.m. ; Thursday through Sunday from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m .

But the best part is Jerry 's Famous or Starky 's Delicatessen ( one name is printed on the front of the menu , the other inside ) on the top floor , where you can get fantastic corned beef and New York pastrami sandwiches ( $ 5.35 for a half ) that are three-quarters very thinly sliced moist meat , and one-quarter very fresh , crusty rye bread . What heaven ! Adults sit at the bar watching sports while children amuse themselves next door at Jerry 's or Starky 's video game arcade , which also vends New York style pizza . The whole arrangement is brilliant . <p> Jerry 's Famous or Starky 's Deli , Beverly Center , corner of Beverly and La Cienega , top floor , Los Angeles .

However , the real blessing is a sausage stand right on the beach walk called Jody Maroni 's , where roller bladers , bike riders and strollers all stop for delicious , juicy and sometimes exotic house-made sausages served on soft onion rolls slathered with onions from the griddle and peppers . The jumbo hot dog ( $ 2.25 ) , all beef , nicely crisped , ca n't be beat , but the all chicken and duck Yucutan sausage ( $ 4.25 ) seasoned with cilantro , chilies and beer , the Pumante ( $ 4.50 ) of pork , prosciutto , sun- dried tomatoes and pine nuts , and the really hot Louisiana Boudin ( $ 3.25 ) made with rice , pork , beef and lots of cayenne are some of the other standouts .

( 213 ) 390-9252 . <p> BORDER GRILL <p> The most happening area along the coast is the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica . It may be the only urban area in greater Los Angeles given over to pedestrians . Benches , water fountains and huge , whimsical dinosaurs made out of climbing plants on wire forms run down the middle of this newly redeveloped boulevard . Both sides of the streets are lined with cafes , movie houses , book and record stores , and shops . Street artists produce air-brush masterpieces in front of your eyes . And just off the promenade is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles , the Border Grill , recently opened by the two women who conceived the super-conceptual City restaurant . <p> The Border Grill is a Mexican restaurant like no other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls and dropped ceilings are passionately painted with outsize primitive figures in primary colors . The food has a similar authentic but reinvented ethos . Patted-to-order miniature tortillas are piled with Mexican- style simmered peppers called rajas and potatoes ( $ 6 ) , shrimp , cucumber , radish and avocado ( $ 7 ) and roasted lamb ( $ 7 ) , among other combinations . Miraculously light empanandas ( $ 5.50 ) are made out of plantains , stuffed with black beans and cheese . A Guatemalan tamale ( $ 6 ) is a stew of fresh corn meal , chicken , raisins and olives steamed in a banana leaf . For main courses , there 's a thick , delicious steak ( $ 17.75 ) in green chili paste , and tender , exotic octopus Veracruzana ( $ 16 ) sauteed with onions and peppers . A very inexpensive children 's menu of tacos ( $ 1 ) and tender baby back ribs ( $ 5 ) roasted with ground chilies and cumin makes this a good place to head if you 're traveling with the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway and Santa Monica Boulevard ) , Santa Monica .
