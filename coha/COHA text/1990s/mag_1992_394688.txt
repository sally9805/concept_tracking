The mere mention of the planet Pluto evokes vivid yet surprisingly different images in the minds of backyard astronomers . On the one hand are images of a young astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh , diligently poring over stacks of photographic plates , searching or a solitary point of light that changed position  --  and finding it . On the other hand are images of a stark , frozen wasteland feebly illuminated by the distant Sun . Yet the images are somewhat misleading . You do n't need the patience of Job ( or Clyde Tombaugh ) and access to a professional observatory 's telescope to see Pluto today . And though the planet may not be warmed significantly by the faraway Sun , enough sunlight reflects off its surface that many Earthbound observers can spot Pluto in their backyard telescopes . Viewing Pluto is a challenge , to be sure . But if you use a good-quality , 8-inch or larger telescope , choose a dark observing site , and know exactly where and when to look , you can see this enigmatic world with your own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to Pluto 's location . All you need to supply are the telescope , the observing site , and a few nights of your time . Fortunately , this spring and summer are excellent seasons to pursue Pluto . First , Pluto is now nearly as bright as it ever gets . ( For several months surrounding its opposition on May 11/12 , the planet glows at a peak magnitude of 13.7 . ) That 's because Pluto is still relatively close to Earth and thus reflects more of the Sun 's light in our direction . Our two worlds were closest to one another just two years ago , and the distant planet moves so slowly in its 248-year orbit around the Sun that it is not much farther away now . Second , Pluto currently is traversing a rather barren area of the sky . Few stars brighter than Pluto lie along the Libra-Serpens Caput border , so it is fairly easy to pick out Pluto from the stellar background . That situation will change over the next decade , however . By the year 2000 , Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ophiuchus , making the job or identifying the planet much more difficult . GETTING READY To take advantage of Pluto 's brightness and prime position , you 'll want to use an 8-inch or larger telescope . A few people have glimpsed Pluto in 6-inch telescopes , but only on exceptionally dark and clear nights . ( Though Pluto is relatively bright this year , the key word is relative . At magnitude 13.7 , the planet is about 1,000 times too faint to be seen without a telescope . ) Compared with a 6-inch telescope , an 8-inch scope collects over 75 percent more light , a 10-inch scope pulls in more than two and a half times as much light , and a 12-inch scope gathers four times as much light . When you 're searching or Pluto , every photon counts . You should also be sure that your telescope is in top working condition . If you have n't cleaned or collimated your scope in a long time , the opportunity to gaze on Pluto gives you a good reason . ( See " How to Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Michael Porcellino in the March and April issues , respectively . ) Next , find an observing site that is as far away from city lights as possible . Even a little bit of scattered light can drown out the light from distant Pluto . High humidity also adds to scattered light so if you can , avoid sites near major rivers , large lakes , or the ocean . Good seeing conditions are important as well . You 'll get steadier eyepiece views if your telescope looks out over a large expanse of grass and worse views if you 're forced to observe over an asphalt parking lot , concrete buildings , or even the roofs of your neighbors ' houses  --  anything that absorbs the Sun 's heat during the day and gives it off again at night . Just as scattered light from a nearby town can drown out your view of Pluto , so can the natural illumination provided by the Moon . The best times to hunt down the elusive ninth planet are when the Moon is out of the sky . Your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon comes on May 2 , so the sky will be dark from the last few days of April through the first week in May . The next observing window covers the last five days of May and the first five days of June , with New Moon on the night of May June 1 . New Moon rolls around again on June 30 , bringing with it dark skies from about June 25 to July 5 . And in July , New Moon comes on the 29th , so dark skies will prevail for the last week of that month and the first few days of August . What you want to do next is wait Cor a night or clear weather during one of the Moon-free periods listed . When that night comes , load up your telescope and head out to your observing site . Plan on arriving no later than sunset so you can set up your telescope before it gets dark . Setting up your scope early gives it time to cool to the ambient air temperature , which will provide you with steadier images . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach thermal equilibrium , you can view the sights or the late spring and summer sky while your eyes become dark-adapted . Now you 're ready to go . The maps at left will help you find Pluto on any day between mid-April and the end of July . The technique is quite simple : star-hop from a group of bright naked-eye stars to stars easier to see in binoculars or a finderscope , and from there go into a telescopic field of view containing Pluto Then center that field in a medium-power eyepiece and you should be able to see the planet . CHASING THE QUARRY The search begins with the bright star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes . This star is easy to find  --  simply follow the curve of the Big Dipper 's handle outward about 30deg . Arcturus is unmistakable  --  it 's the brightest star in the spring sky at magnitude 0.0 and appears orangish to the naked eye . After arcing to Arcturus , speed on another 20deg or so until you reach the luminary of Virgo , the 1st-magnitude star Spica . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make a closed fist and hold it at arm 's length . The angle spanned by your fist is then about 8deg to 10deg . ) Now shift your gaze about 25deg due east of Spica , to Libra 's brightest star , 3rd-magnitude Beta Librae ( Beta Lib ) . Beta and the 3.5-magnitude star Mu Serpentis ( mu Ser ) , which is located some 10deg to the northeast or Beta , are the two key jumping-off points to reaching the faint stars in Pluto 's vicinity . Now it 's time to pull out the binoculars . You need to locate the 8th-magnitude star SAO 140663 that is located about 3deg due west of Mu Serpentis . Pluto lies just 0.5deg west of this star in mid-April . Though Pluto moves away from SAO 140663 alter April , several other stars in the vicinity serve as guide stars , and they are only slightly fainter . You can find these on the telescopic finder chart , which shows stars down to magnitude 14.5 . ( On this chart , south is at top to match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopic finder , locate Pluto 's position on the chart or the day you 're observing . ( The positions are given for 11 p.m . EDT , 10 p.m . CDT , 9 p.m . MDT , and 8 p.m . PDT . Pluto moves so slowly , however , that the positions shown are close for the entire night . ) Then star-hop to that region by gently moving your telescope from one reasonably bright star to the next . IS THAT DOT REALLY PLUTO ? Once you 've located the correct field , center Pluto 's position in a low-power eyepiece . Then increase the power to about 10x per inch of aperture . You should be able to tell which of the pinpoints of light is actually Pluto by comparing the finder chart with your view in the eyepiece . But if the field is a bit too crowded or you 're just a little bit unsure , you need to confirm your sighting . To do this , you have to detect Pluto 's motion relative to the background stars . ( The stars themselves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch of the field of view , concentrating particularly on the stars near what you think is Pluto and on the stars shining at about the same brightness as Pluto . If you 're an astrophotographer , you can photograph the star field instead . Then return a night or two later and compare your sketch with the current field of view . If you were right about Pluto , it will have changed position slightly . If you were wrong , that star will be stationary but another one in the field of view will have moved a bit , revealing its identity as Pluto . What you see is a far cry from the otherworldly landscapes you may have envisioned . After all , that point of light you 're looking at is the smallest planet in the solar system and you 're viewing it from a distance of more than 2.6 billion miles . But use your imagination and that faint glimmer of light magically transforms into a real word  --  a frigid world of rock and ice slowly circling the distant Sun in a deep and permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings with it a rare and potentially very exciting event  --  the occultation of a 14th-magnitude star by Pluto and perhaps its satellite Charon . The light of the distant star will be blocked from view as Pluto casts a shadow all the way to Earth , over 2.6 billion miles away . The event is timed perfectly for North American observers , though the Moon is a waning gibbous that night . Current predictions say the middle of the Pluto occultation will occur at 2:17 a.m . EDT ( 1:17 a.m . CDT , 12:17 a.m . MDT , and 11:17 p.m . PDT ) while that for Charon will come one minute earlier , though the times could be off by a minute or two . At those times Pluto is above the horizon for the entire Western Hemisphere . The only question is whether the occultation will be visible from North or South America . Astronomers do not know the orbit of Pluto precisely enough to pinpoint where on Earth Pluto 's shadow will fall . If you watch this event , you 'll see Pluto slowly creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position at 11 p.m . EDT over a seven-day span . ) The two will appear to merge in your eyepiece well before the occultation begins because the seeing broadens the images of both objects . At the time of the occultation , the combined light of the two will drop by a third . You can observe the event the fun of it , or you can help astronomers refine their knowledge of the Pluto-Charon system by accurately timing the occultation . If you choose to do the latter , at least a few nights before the 20th , identify the field of the soon-to-be-occulted star using the finder chart below , which shows south at top . On the night of May 20/21 , set up your telescope ahead of time to let it reach thermal equilibrium . Bring along a small audio tape recorder and a radio capable of receiving WWV or WWVH , which broadcast the accurate time at frequencies of 2.5 MHz , 5 MHz , 10 MHz , 15MHz , and 20 MHz . In eastern Canada , radio station CHU also broadcasts accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on local radio stations or the phone company the time  --  they can be off by several seconds . Around the time of the occultation , let the tape recorder run and the radio play in the background while you watch the star continuously . When it disappears and reappears , shout the event into the recorder . Also , do n't forget that both Pluto and Charon may occult the star , so be prepared Cor up to four events . When you replay the tape , you can determine the time of the occultation to within about a quarter of a second . ( Take into account your reaction time , which is typically between 0.2 and 0.5 second . ) Also record the time you started and stopped looking at the star . Write down the precise latitude , longitude , and altitude of your observing site , the type of telescope , the eyepiece power , and the local weather conditions , including the seeing and sky transparency . You can get a standard report form from the International Occultation Timing Association at 1177 SW Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations can be sent to IOTA in care of Jim Stamm , 11781 North Joi Drive , Tucson , AZ 85737 . <p>                     @x EVERYDAY IN MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY , TEACHER-LIBRARIANS WORK WITH STUDENTS FROM A RANGE OF CULTURES/ETHNICITIES AND WITH VARIED ABILITIES . AS PART OF THEIR WORK , TEACHER-LIBRARIANS ARE CHARGED WITH MEETING THE LITERACY NEEDS OF EACH OF THESE STUDENTS ON THEIR LEARNING JOURNEY . <p> Over the past ten years , as I have networked with teacher-librarians in schools and at conferences , attended lectures and presentations , as well as reviewed articles written on the topic , it is clear that as professionals , teacher-librarians have become more responsive to the needs of these students . Indeed , teacher-librarians have recognized the importance of providing access , representative collections , and programming targeted to students from the various cultural groups . <p> In our interactions with diverse learners in this multicultural society , another key aspect to consider is providing culturally responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within cultures varies and one can not generalize across cultural groups , it would be impossible to provide suggestions here that work in all instances . Regardless of the individual , however , there are four important principles to help guide interactions with diverse cultures : 1 ) be sensitive to different learning and engagement styles , 2 ) use teaching strategies to help accommodate those styles , 3 ) be flexible in altering techniques , and 4 ) reflect on what occurred in the interaction in order to improve future interchanges . <p> L : DEFINING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTION In setting the stage , it is necessary to understand the term " culturally responsive , " but there are various definitions . Culturally responsive , standards-based instruction ( CRSBI ) , for example , is a teaching style that validates and incorporates students ' cultural background , ethnic history , and current societal interests into daily , standards-based instruction . It addresses socio-emotional needs and uses ethnically and culturally diverse material ( Banks , 1991 ; Gay , 2000 ) . Gloria Ladson-Billings ( 1994 ) states that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and politically by using cultural and historical references to convey knowledge , impart skills , and change attitudes . Culturally responsive teachers are also sensitive to the linguistic and behavioral skill gaps . <p> Environments that are positive and affirming are also important to students ( Davis , 2007 , Robins et al , 2006 ; Banks , 2000 , 2006 ; Mestre , 2004 ; Clayton , 2003 ; Gay , 2000 , 2002 ; LeCompte &; McCray 2002 ; Sleeter , 2001 ; Nieto &; Rolan , 1997 ; Wlodkowski and Ginsberg , M. B. , 1995 ; Ladson-Billings , G. ( 1994 ) . Students should feel they have caring , involved interactions in the classrooms as well as the library and it is necessary to create a culturally responsive atmosphere in both places . <p> L : WHY WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTION Developing culturally responsive instruction is one way the teacher-librarian can play an important role in the education of students . If students are hesitant to use school library resources , or instructions for searching and finding materials are not clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Feeling ignored , judged , or disrespected will very likely adversely affect students ' experiences . However , if students have successful experiences in the school library , they will come to believe the library 's resources ( including staff resources ) can help them in their research and can enhance their academic potential . They will learn there are trained professionals to help them navigate the sea of resources . <p> Regardless of their backgrounds , students need to know that school library staff cares about them and they can expect the following characteristics from the staff : empathy , caring , the ability to create a healthful climate , leadership skills , humor , and that they are involved with children 's social relations ( Piazza , 2001 ; Gay , 2000 ; Ladson-Billings , 1994 ) . <p> Although our urban , rural , and suburban settings are more diverse than ever , the overwhelming majority of library personnel continue to come from middle class , European American backgrounds ( National Collaborative on Diversity in the Teaching Force , 2004 ) . Many librarians are now struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cultural backgrounds distinctly different from each other and from their teachers . It may be a challenge to change for the teacher-librarian who has only used teaching strategies and examples based on his or her life experiences . However , embracing the notion of cultural responsiveness can contribute to helping all students reach high standards . <p> L : PROVIDING RELEVANT EXAMPLES It is also important to make instructional interactions culturally relevant to all students , rather than solely to the majority . Gay ( 2000 ) discusses the importance of using students ' past experiences ( whether cultural or frames of reference ) in examples used to help make learning more relevant and effective to them . Realistically , in the limited time available to librarians , there may be little opportunity to explore every student 's experiences . However , as librarians become more aware of specific examples that resonate with students , those examples could be incorporated into future sessions , exhibits , book displays , handouts , and instruction guides ( whether in print or online ) . Even a relatively simple act of displaying images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help students feel accepted and better connected to the library as a place where they belong . <p> There are many other opportunities to make examples real and relevant to students , such as identifying authors , sources , or topics with which specific cultures associate ( e.g. , a relevant African American , Latino , Asian American , or figure in the gay community ) . Sheets ( 2005 ) points out that competent teachers acknowledge the connection between culture and learning . Agosto ( 2007 ) also addresses the importance for teacher-librarians to evaluate and integrate multicultural resources into the curricula . By incorporating the students ' historical knowledge and analysis into library projects , students may feel as though they are validated and their culture is relevant to the learning experience . They may also be more engaged and motivated to succeed if their cultural knowledge and learning styles are acknowledged . <p> L : CULTURALLY PROFICIENT INSTRUCTION Robins ( 2006 ) defines cultural proficiency in her book Culturally Proficient Instruction : A Guide for People Who Teach as " a way of being that allows individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robins also outlines the essential steps to take toward cultural proficiency : Name the differences ( assess culture ) ; claim the differences ( value diversity ) ; reframe the differences ( manage the dynamics of difference ) ; train about differences ( adapt to diversity ) ; and change for differences ( institutionalize cultural knowledge ) . Wlodkowski and Ginsberg ( 1995 ) also provide a framework for culturally responsive teaching . The elements outlined by both authors could serve as a good model for teacher-librarians . <p> Culture also influences cognitive and social development and therefore play a role in teaching and learning situations . Students need multiple and consistent opportunities to practice higher-level thinking skills if they are to develop as advanced critical thinkers . As such , cultural adaptations are necessary with diverse learners because students acquire and display knowledge in different ways . It is also important to remember that all students come into the library with some prior knowledge on which they can build . And so , making the task relevant to their everyday practical experience will help students be successful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Providing opportunities for students to view reality through numerous perspectives helps them understand , evaluate , question , and challenge the issues . <p> Establishing a connection with each child is important in building relationships as well as emphasizing the responsibility that all children have for one another . Cifuentes and Ozel ( 2006 ) explain the benefit of allowing students to take control of their learning . Gay ( 2002 ) also speak of communities of learners working together : " In these communities students pool their intellectual resources and work diligently to help each other learn . They are taught that the learning of each individual is not complete until all members of the class have learned to the best of their ability " ( p. 622 ) . One way to work with students as communities is to have groups of students working on a task together but take turns typing at the keyboard while other students offer support . The teacher-librarian serves as a guide to help students figure out the answer on their own . For example , if the teacher-librarian asks , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retrieve these items ? " the student first might ask , " What do you mean by retrieve ? " Or , if the student understands that concept he or she would speak aloud and explain , " Well , I 've already checked the items that I want . I guess I would look for some button that says " get the articles or open . ... " Chances are the database will not have those terms , which then provides a great teaching opportunity for the librarian to help the students construct meaning from the search . <p> Because many cultural groups like to work collaboratively , inviting other classmates to contribute suggestions can put less pressure on a student and help with interactions ( Allison &; Rehn , 2007 ; Davis , 2007 ; Slavin 2001 ) . The teacher-librarian could ask what they would want to do with the articles or citations once they got them . Hopefully someone would provide words like " look at them ( view ) , print , save , or e-mail " . These types of brainstorming sessions allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way things are termed or organized . By also allowing students to do the keyboarding , teacher-librarians can get a glimpse of how novices search and try to assist them in understanding how things work and why . Students are much more engaged when they are active participants . In fact , if this is a group lesson , switching students at the keyboard is helpful . Students often are quite attentive because they do not know when it might be their turn to be at the keyboard . This process works well with almost any group , regardless of age , culture , or language . In fact , although it will take longer to get through a demonstration , it will most likely engage the participants and provide a more lasting and meaningful learning experience . <p> L : QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES As teacher-librarians attempt to engage students by asking questions , they might do well to think about how they ask questions . Many teacher-librarians have already shifted from asking closed-ended questions to open-ended questions . By shifting to that type of inquiry , teacher-librarians can allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Open-ended questions also give students who prefer an inductive problem solving and reasoning approach , an opportunity to focus on the whole , rather than on the details . Some cultural groups prefer this type of inductive process ( Brice Heath , 1982 ; Irvine &; York , 1995 ) . Rather than asking a question like " How many responses did you get for this search ? " the teacher-librarian could ask " What can you tell me about the results you got from this search ? " This then allows the students to reflect on what is important to them in the search process . They may mention the number of results , but more important for them , they may provide a bigger picture of what was retrieved , such as the focus of the information received , the types of sources , and how relevant they may be for their needs . A particular citation might trigger something for them that they might share with others as they work toward the detail level . Open-ended questions are good tools for developing critical thinking . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may hesitate to volunteer an answer because they may be concerned about what their peers or the teacher-librarian would think of them if they provide a wrong answer . This is especially true for groups that are not raised in individualistic , competitive environments . The teacher-librarian can create a safe environment for students by encouraging multiple answers and not judging negatively on any answer . For example , rather than asking " what 's the correct subject heading for someone looking to find information about African Americans and achievement ? " the librarian might say : " The library catalog does n't always reflect current cultural terms or even provide what we would think as logical headings . Take a minute to write down a couple of ideas of what terms you would try . After a minute I 'll ask you to share them while I write them on the marker board . " By providing first an explanation reassuring them that if their term does not show up in the catalog it does n't mean that it is incorrect , students will not feel stress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , students get a chance to process their thoughts by writing them down . After this exercise , they may be more willing to share their response if they see the teacher-librarian writing down all the answers provided , not just the ones the teacher-librarian feels are correct . This nonjudgmental approach provides an opportunity for engagement with the topic without fear of rejection . <p> L : BECOMING CULTURALLY COMPETENT Teacher-librarians no doubt have their finger on the pulse of the cultures that the library serves , so should be able to focus their efforts on learning more about those cultures so they can better serve them . At least by being aware of the representative languages , cultures , and learning styles , librarians can make instruction more meaningful and relevant to their students ' lives . In addition to the background information , it is useful for teacher-librarians to also learn about differences in learning and teaching styles , including verbal and non verbal communications styles and preferences of various groups ( Allison &; Rehm , 2007 ; Cifuentes and Ozel , 2006 ; Dunn , 2003 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mestre , 2000 ; Irvine , 1995 ; Downing , 1993 ) . Teacher-librarians will need to develop a repertoire of strategies to use and to alter in order to tailor them to individual students . Some students may need to have material in print in front of them so they can refer to it ( especially those whose first language is not English ) , and some may prefer more hands-on practice , rather than just sitting for a lecture . In short , if instructors vary their teaching styles to accommodate different learning styles and also try different approaches to find the best fit for the user , they will be accommodating many users ' learning needs . As instructors vary their teaching styles , they also help strengthen students ' ability to learn in multiple ways . <p> L : CONCLUSION Within today 's diverse society , all students need to have access not only to information resources , but also to appropriate instruction on how to access , search , use , and evaluate resources . Teacher-librarians should keep in mind that their targeted audience extends beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so teacher-librarians will understand how their own ethnic , cultural , and linguistic background , as well as perspectives guide their perceptions and attitudes , and influences how they think and act . The teacher-librarian 's influence as a teacher ( the influence they have as a type of authority figure as well as their influence in deciding what students are exposed to and how it 's presented ) plays an important role in how students use the library . <p> Creating culturally inclusive teaching/ learning events will not only enhance the experience of students but is one step in providing an environment that affirms , respects , and acknowledges differences in individuals and in groups . <p> L : REFERENCES  --  Agosto , D.
