<p> On shaky scientific evidence , Congress is forging ahead to mandate the use of alternative automobile fuels . It 's probably going to make no difference in pollution levels . It 's definitely going to cost you a bundle . The likes of Bob Dole and Dwayne Andreas will see to it . <p> It 's coming soon to a gas station near you . It may cost you more than the price of a movie ticket each week . And you may get less out of it than you got out of that foreign film you went to where you thought there would be subtitles . Introducing alternative fuels , one part of the Clean Air Act which Congress came close to passing this year and which will be back next year with a vengeance . While the Bush Administration has estimated the cost of the Act at " only " $21.5 billion a year , according to the Business Roundtable , an association of chief executives from US. - based Fortune 500 companies , the annual cost could range from a " best estimate " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the White House described the Bush alternative fuels proposal as " perhaps the most innovative and far-reaching component " of the act , the congressional Office of Technology Assessment has calculated that the alternative fuels provision will be , per ton of pollutants removed , the most expensive part of the act . <p> You 've probably heard something about alternative or " clean " fuels , most of it positive . The Clean Air Act aside , the crisis in the Persian Gulf has focused even greater attention on them . What you may not have heard about are the added costs , concerns over increasing ozone pollution ( this is surface ozone and has nothing to do with the alleged depletion of the upper-atmospheric ozone layer ) , concerns over safety , and the politics behind these alleged wunderfuels . Alas , like most things in life , these fuels just are n't what they 're cracked up to be . If we do n't watch out , we could soon be paying more for air that is dirtier than it is now . <p> Most automobile air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car 's cylinders , although some may be emitted from the gas tank itself or when cars are fueled at the pump . Nitrogen oxide , carbon monoxide , and various trace substances ( aldehydes , olefins , hydrocarbons ) spew out of tailpipes . Collectively , they are called " volatile organic compounds " ( VOCs ) . Some , like carbon monoxide , cause pollution directly , while others , such as nitrogen oxide , hydrocarbons , and aldehydes , when cooked by sunlight , form ozone . These non-carbon monoxide pollutants come together and form smog . <p> Alternative fuels are supposed to reduce air pollution by reducing some or all of these emissions . That is the theory . Here are the dirty secrets of these allegedly clean fuels . I. FUELS AND COSTS <p> All of the alternative fuels will be more expensive than gasoline in some ways ; the only question is how much more . Methanol , or wood alcohol , is normally manufactured from either natural gas or coal . Many consider it the alternative fuel of choice . C. Boyden Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alternative fuels , drives a methanol-powered car . Methanol works well in internal combustion engines . The fact that it has a higher octane rating than unleaded gasoline helps prevent knocking , or " pinging , " and translates into more power when you push down on the accelerator . It has been used in the race cars at the Indy 500 for years . <p> But methanol fuel has half the energy value of gasoline ; the same volume will propel a car only half as far . Methanol would require either doubling the size of the gas tank  --  a severe logistical problem  --  or cutting cruise range in half . If mass-produced for automobiles , methanol would cost anywhere from 50 to 90 cents a gallon ; before the outbreak of the Iraq crisis , gasoline was wholesaling at about 65 cents a gallon . Taking into account the fewer miles per gallon , drivers ' fuel bills , presently averaging $543 a year , would increase dramatically . A recent national poll showed that those questioned , while willing to pay for testing and repairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile emission systems , showed no such willingness to pay 20 cents extra per gallon for cleaner fuels . <p> Obviously , converting existing cars to methanol use would involve considerable expense . But even off the assembly line , such cars would cost about $300 more than their gasoline equivalents . Of course , given that an air bag can add $1,000 to the cost of a car , this could be considered a good investment  --  if in fact there were a real reduction in overall emissions . But that is not necessarily the case . <p> Ethanol is distilled from corn , sugar cane , or other grains , and is mixed with nine parts gasoline to create gasohol . Adding ethanol to gasoline adds oxygen to the fuel as well , hence it is called an " oxyfuel . " Introduced over a century ago , ethanol gained attention during the oil " crisis " of the 1970s , when Congress sought to reduce oil imports and prop up sagging corn prices . Ethanol is used primarily in the Midwest , and accounts for a bit less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold annually in the United States . <p> A fundamental drawback of ethanol is cost : almost $1.40 per gallon to produce only 70 percent of the energy of normal gasoline . To make ethanol competitive , the federal and state governments have given tax exemptions of 60 cents to 80 cents per gallon to gasohol producers , over $4.6 billion since 1980  --  most of which would otherwise have gone to the Federal Highway Trust Fund to rebuild and maintain roads . Ethanol also takes advantage of corn subsidies , over $1.2 billion since 1980 , with about $1 billion of that since 1985 . Moreover , the tax subsidies , by driving up the demand for and the price of corn , raise food prices . Yet the increase in the corn price has been small enough for the Department of Agriculture to conclude in a study that ethanol is a wasteful farm program . The federal General Accounting Office did calculate that ethanol saved more by reducing farm subsidies than it costs in highway subsidies , but this assumes that farm subsidies will remain at their current high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that one needless subsidy can slightly reduce another . <p> The Brazilian ethanol lesson is one to be heeded . A decade ago that nation , with a $250 million loan from the World Bank , began to convert its automobiles to run on pure ethanol . The use of cropland to grow sugar cane for distillation , along with heavy government subsidies to make ethanol competitive with gasoline , has helped make Brazil the Third World 's largest debtor and contributed to its 1,000 percent inflation rate . Last year , a World Bank study urged an end to the alcohol program , calling it inefficient and costly compared to world oil prices . Nonetheless , Brazilian manufacturers continue to turn out ehthanol-powered vehicles , forcing the country to make huge purchases of over 100 million gallons of the fuel from U.S. companies . So much for a program designed to reduce Brazil 's dependence on imported fuel . <p> Closer to home , Colorado 's three-year-old oxyfuel program has been heralded as a great success  --  by those who run it . However , experts like Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado at Denver , question whether the program has brought any real improvement in Denver 's air quality . His worries were recently confirmed by an independent analysis of Colorado 's clean air program conducted by the Milliken Research Group , Inc. , sponsored by gasoline refiners and marketers . The study noted that carbon monoxide levels in Denver 's air have declined an average of 29.1 percent each year since 1982 , and are expected to continue to decline . Denver could comply with federal ambient carbon monoxide standards as early as 1991 , with little if any deviation from this trend attributable to the oxyfuels program . According to the University of Denver 's director of atmospheric sciences Clay Smith , who worked on the study , oxyfuels have probably done nothing to help bring Denver into compliance . " At best , oxyfuels will put us into compliance one year earlier . " Says Smith , " Oxyfuels are of marginal benefit in improving air quality . They 're too expensive . " <p> The experiences of other states , whose officials enacted oxyfuels programs in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . Gary Woodard , a researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson , recently completed a study for that state 's legislature of oxyfuels programs in Arizona and other states . " The costs were a lot higher than most people expected , " says Woodard . He found that the highest figure the Colorado Department of Health had been using for its program , about $8 million to $9 million , " is probably a low-end figure , and the actual range is about nine to fifteen million . " Woodard found that the Colorado program made assumptions that just did n't jibe with reality , such as one indicating a mileage improvement in older vehicles ; Woodard found that converted older vehicles had had a mileage reduction , though not as dramatic as newer vehicles . He found , too , that Colorado 's program represented the best-case scenario , with a more competitive fuel market , a shorter program ( four months per year versus six in Phoenix and other cities ) , and higher elevation . Woodard found that per pound of carbon monoxide removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that of Colorado . Nonetheless , the figures put forth by the Colorado Department of Health are used by Congress to estimate the cost of mandating oxyfuels for much of the country . Woodard also found that the oxyfuels program in Arizona was considerably less cost-effective than the emissions inspection and maintenance program already in place , and that it appeared to hamper that program by allowing some cars to pass inspection that would n't have , leaving them to pollute excessively during the warm months when oxyfuels are not used . <p> Mandating a greater use of ethanol would increase the already massive subsidies ethanol producers and corn growers receive , with resulting dislocations elsewhere . Further , ethanol has been shown to corrode and to cause build-up on engine and fuel system parts , sometimes prompting repairs of up to $800 in middle-priced cars . The owner 's manuals for 1987 BMWs , Chryslers , Fords , General Motors cars , Hondas , and Volkswagens all caution that ethanol can cause problems . <p> ETBE , a new combination of ethanol and t-butanol ( a petroleum extract ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine parts , but like ethanol it owes its existence to heavy subsidies . <p> MTBE , a combination of methanol and t-butanol , is also an oxyfuel when added in a large quantity to gasoline ( eleven parts per hundred under Colorado 's program ) . Like ethanol , it produces a leaner burn and is an octane booster , but is more expensive than gasoline , causes corrosion and fouling  --  albeit less than ethanol  --  and lowers mileage . About one-third of the MTBE sold in the U.S. is produced by one t company , ARCO . <p> Natural gas is mostly methane . Like oil , it is tapped primarily from wells , but it can also be extracted from coal mines or made from garbage . For use as a motor fuel , however , natural gas must be compressed or liquified . Liquefied natural gas needs to be kept at temperatures far below the freezing point and is not yet practical for vehicles . Compressed natural gas ( CNG ) is practical and is used in fleet vehicles ( taxis , company cars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more efficient means of using natural gas than converting it to methanol , in that methanol conversion results in the loss of 43 percent of the original energy , while CNG allows 84 percent of the gas 's original energy to be used . Unlike other alternative fuels , CNG can not only compete with gasoline costs but is in fact considerably cheaper per mile . It has an extremely high octane level , and allows vehicles to start and run much as they do on gasoline . They take much longer to refuel unless the gas is compressed before it reaches the dispensing unit . Unfortunately , compressing stations cost about ten times as much as ordinary pumps . <p> CNG cars need not only different engines and fuel systems , but also fuel tanks of very heavy stainless steel construction or somewhat lighter aluminum composite cylinders , both of which can significantly limit mileage . And CNG has even less energy value than methanol ; compressed to 2,400 pounds per square inch , it still only has about one-fifth the energy of gasoline per unit of weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of CNG vehicles are 20 to 65 percent lower than those of typical gasoline vehicles . Finally , a CNG vehicle would cost about $1,000 more than its gasoline equivalent . <p> New Zealand , which produces all of its own natural gas , put much stock in CNG . But when the government ended subsidies for vehicle conversions and oil prices fell , the number of new conversions plummeted . <p> Propane , or liqulfied petroleum gas , is a paraffin : although a petroleum product ( it can also be produced from natural gas ) , it contains none of the olefins or aromatics that produce smog . Propane mixes very well witn air , and , like compressed gas , is already vaporous when mixing in the injection ports of carburetors , reducing the pollutants ordinarily released when an engine turns over . It also has the major disadvantage of needing heavy tanks for fuel storage . Propane 's energy value is somewhat below gasoline 's  --  about 85 percent  --  but in cost per mile this is more than made up for by the lower price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cost more than gasoline cars , probably somewhere between methanol cars and CNG cars . Propane is already used to power indoor forklifts and some other fleet vehicles . <p> Electric vehicles ( EVs ) , which run on batteries , were said in the mid-1970s to be the car of the future . In 1990 they remain the car of the future , at least for private ( non-fleet ) owners , but the future may at last be drawing close . General Motors has developed an electric vehicle , the Impact , which may be in dealer showrooms by the mid-1990s . A sleek two-seater coupe , the Impact accelerates as quickly as many gasoline-powered sports cars and has a top speed of more than 100 miles per hour . <p> California has contracted for 10,000 electric cars for fleet use , which are to be built in Sweden and in Colorado by a company called Unique Mobility , Inc , and are scheduled for deployment by 1995 . Currently , the most expensive part of powering an electric car is not the electricity itself but the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The batteries now powering the Impact need replacement every 20,000 miles or so , which would make electric cars twice as expensive per mile as gasoline cars . GM engineers are confident that within the next few years that capacity can be doubled to a competitive 40,000 miles . Another battery being produced is expected to have a life of 100,000 miles . The Impact is limited by range ( 124 miles ) and recharging time ( two hours ) . The Unique Mobility mini-van has a range of 100 miles , which can be extended by a small on-board propane-powered engine , and its batteries need up to eight hours to charge . Eventually , solar cells may be put on automobiles to provide extended range , but passenger vehicles run solely on solar energy will never be practicable simply because the cells ca n't produce enough power for acceleration , no matter how efficient they are at converting sunlight . <p> Reformulated gasoline , unlike most alternative fuels , is a petroleum product . Oxygen is added to reformulated gasoline by adding about two to three parts per hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the removal of aromatics that lead to ozone formation , such as benzene and toluene . Reformulated gasoline has an energy value only about two percent lower than conventional unleaded gasoline and can use the same pipelines , engines , and gas tanks . Therefore , the extra two to three cents per gallon cost will be the total added cost . Further , because it requires no new equipment , reformulated gasoline 's effect on pollution levels is instantaneous . <p> ( One much-ballyhooed alternative fuel  --  hydrogen  --  has not been discussed here . That 's because it 's still completely experimental and not likely to be used for years to come , regardless of merit . ) II . SAFETY <p> It is well known that gasoline can be dangerous . Although automobile explosions are actually quite rare , especially in comparison to those depicted on television and in the cinema , they do occur . Gasoline can also be toxic . But the dangers of gasoline may be dwarfed by those of its alternatives . <p> Methanol is more acutely toxic than gasoline , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be taken into the lungs to cause damage , but just a small amount of swallowed methanol can cause blindness , nerve damage , or death . It is colorless , and  --  unlike gasoline  --  both tasteless and odorless . If methanol came into widespread use it could cause many fatalities and dramatically increase the incidence of accidental blindness . People could ingest it accidentally by siphoning it orally , as they siphon gasoline . And methanol is toxic even when absorbed through the skin ; drivers and service station personnel could be exposed by continuing to wear clothing on which they accidentally spilled methanol . Methanol burns with no flame and no smoke , making methanol fires much more difficult to spot and fight . If you 've ever seen a driver running frantically from a crashed Formula One racing car as if being burned by invisible flames , then you 've witnessed this effect . <p> Some of these problems could be corrected by using a mix of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline , or " M85 , " which gives the fuel a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also makes vehicles easier to start in cold weather . But such a mixture greatly increases emissions , possibly negating the effect of using methanol in the first place . <p> On the brighter side , despite tunnel bans in many areas on vehicles carrying propane , it appears that both propane and natural gas are just as safe in the event of a collision as is gasoline . Indeed , containers for alternative fuels are so solid that the explosion rate for these vehicles is below that of gasoline cars . III . POLLUTION <p> The House and Senate bills refer to alternative fuels as " clean fuels , " as do most members of the media . This is a gross misnomer . All fuels cause pollution , and some " clean fuels " are dirtier for some emissions than gasoline . The widespread belief that methanol produces significantly reduced emissions is based on theory , outdated studies , and erroneous presumptions . Many recent tests have shown no benefit , or even a detriment , from burning methanol instead of gasoline . An Environmental Protection Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrocarbons as gasoline , with M85 producing about two-thirds as much . But a study by the California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) shows only tiny differences , and a study by Sierra Research , a California consulting firm that has done extensive work for the governments of eight northeastern states and California , shows both M85 and M100 emitting slightly more hydrocarbons than gasoline . As for nitrogen oxide , the other principal component of smog , methanol has , in test after test , car after car , caused higher emissions . M85 produces three to five times more formaldehyde than does gasoline . Formaldehyde is another component of smog and a suspected human carcinogen . M85 has also proved to produce as much or more carbon monoxide than gasoline . <p> A leading environmentalist and a White House appointee under President Carter , James MacKenzie of the World Resources Institute , says of methanol : " It 's a turkey . It has nothing to offer . " Both the EPA and Congress 's own Of fice of Technology Assessment believe methanol would bring little improvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court order blocking the fuel 's importation . Perhaps the best we can hope for from tremendous expenditures for methanol would be only slightly more pollution than we get from gasoline . Finally , widespread use of methanol from natural gas would probably result in either importing the methanol from foreign countries or converting abundant domestic coal supples  --  a process that generates large amounts of carbon dioxide . This would be ironic , as the Clean Air Act will mandate severe and expensive controls on carbon dioxide emissions in the belief that they contribute to global warming . <p> Ethanol can reduce carbon monoxide emissions in some cars by adding oxygen to fuel , but it too may end up causing more pollution than it prevents . A Sierra Research study concluded that ethanol would cut carbon monoxide by 25 percent , but that nitrogen oxides , which cause smog and acid ' rain , would rise by 8 to 15 percent , and hydrocarbons by 50 percent . That works out to six percent more smog . Tom Austin , former head of the CARB Mobile Sources Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Motorists will end up paying more for dirtier air . " Because the study was financed by the oil industry , some opponents cried foul . But the CARB and the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management , two entities with the toughest air standards in the world , have agreed with the findings . The study should have come as no surprise to the EPA , which found that the use of ethanol so increased evaporative emissions from gas tanks that the fuel could not qualify for use under the 1977 Clean Air Act . A loophole in the regulations allowed ethanol to be used without EPA permission . In 1987 , another request for formal gasohol approval was denied on similar grounds . <p> All cars built since the mid-1980s have oxygen sensors that automatically adjust the burn mixture . For such cars , there are few advantages to oxygenated fuels . In older cars or cars with broken oxygen sensors , oxyfuels have been shown to reduce carbon monoxide emissions , but to mandate that everyone in an area use such fuels for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirin each day because some people will develop headaches . While ethanol , added costs aside , might prove useful for a minority of cars in cities where carbon monoxide is a problem but ozone is n't  --  such as Las Vegas , Denver , and Phoenix  --  it makes no sense for areas with ozone problems . <p> Electric vehicles , since they have no tailpipes , appear to emit no pollution until one considers they are ultimately powered by some other fuel , whether oil , coal , or nuclear . Nevertheless , electric car engines are so efficient compared to internal combustion ones that , depending on the type of plant generating the electricity , they can be up to 90 percent cleaner for nitrogen oxide and 99 percent cleaner for carbon monoxide and other gases . Indeed , if nuclear power is used to generate the electricity , gaseous pollution is reduced to nearly zero . <p> As for natural gas , limited testing indicates hydrocarbon emissions may be significantly lower than for gasoline engines . Stronger evidence indicates a major decrease in carbon monoxide emissions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates that condensed gas would actually increase emissions significantly , but others have concluded that with properly designed engines , nitrogen oxide emissions would be lower than with gasoline . Propane has significantly lower carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions , and causes nitrogen oxide emissions that , while no lower than gasoline , are not significantly higher , either . <p> The least of the alternative fuels  --  in several senses of the word  --  is reformulated gasoline . Gasoline is currently reformulated by removing olefins and aromatics and replacing them with a small amount of MTBE to keep the octane up . Like the oxyfuels , reformulated gasoline works best for the dirtiest-running cars but has little effect on clean-running ones . Nevertheless , it is less expensive than the oxyfuels , causes no damage to car engines or fuel lines , and is being touted by the oil industry as only a temporary measure en route to better reformulations . To find the right recipe for reformulated gasoline , fourteen oil companies and the Big Three auto companies have embarked on an unprecedented joint research and testing program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the most comprehensive analysis of its kind ever undertaken , and the results are expected late this year . Unfortunately , Congress would not wait before promulgating its own recipes . Both House and Senate versions of the bill require fairly specific formulas for what should and should not be in fuel . But even C. Boyden Gray says that it should not be up to Congress to devise recipes for fuel , rather that the petroleum industry , with over a hundred years of experience in refining , should be given performance standards rather than specific recipes . IV . THE POLITICS OF ETHANOL <p> If alternative fuels are not the wonders we 've generally been told , what is the driving force behind them ? In part it is the belief that gasoline , since it has contributed so much to air pollution , is somehow immoral , and that any alternative must therefore be better . But the case for ethanol , the " most successful " alternative fuel , is based not on idealism but on good old-fashioned politics and payoffs . Indeed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fuel today without the massive lobbying effort of Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) , a Decatur , Illinois-based corporation , and its chairman Dwayne Andreas . <p> Archer Daniels , with gross annual revenues of about $7 billion , is the largest grain processing company in the world . It also has a 60 percent share of the U.S. ethanol market , according to the Renewable Fuels Association , a lobbying group funded primarily by ADM . The corporation puts out as little hard information as possible and does n't even maintain a press office , although this does n't prevent some of its individual officials from complaining about the media more than Reed Irvine ever does . Nor does it break down earnings by product , but , according to George Dahlman of Piper , Jaffray &; Hopwood , Inc. , about 27 percent of its revenue , approximately $1.9 billion , comes from corn processing . About one-third of that , or $633 million , comes from ethanol , the rest from the sale of high-fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) , a sugar substitute . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time , but only since the late 1970s has it surpassed corn starch , glucose , and dextrose . In 1975 corn refiners produced only half a million tons of the syrup . By 1980 this had jumped to 2.2 million , by 1985 to 5.1 million . <p> It 's no coincidence that the corn syrup boom has paralleled the increase in gasohol production . Wet-milling ethanol plants ( including all of Archer Daniels 's ) , in which water is added during the milling process , can produce ethanol at lower cost than dry-milling ones ( where water is added downstream during milling ) , in part because their facilities are shared with corn syrup production . Ethanol can be produced using excess syrup capacity during the winter , when demand for the sweetener is low due to lower soft drink consumption . Thus , every subsidy , every food giveaway , every government support for ethanol is also a support for high fructose corn syrup . Sugar price supports and sugar import restrictions , both of which Archer Daniels has lobbied for through its representatives , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two pro-gasohol lobbying organizations located in Washington , the Renewable Fuels Association and the Corn Growers Association . In the last presidential race , Archer Daniels and the Andreas family contributed to the campaigns of both George Bush and Michael Dukakis , as well as those of Jesse Jackson , Albert Gore , Paul Simon , and Robert Dole . <p> The point man for Andreas has been Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole , Republican of Kansas . Dole sponsored the original 1978 amendment that provided a tax break for gasohol and at least twenty-four other bills designed to promote the product . For their part , Andreas and Archer Daniels 's PAC have kicked in at least $87,000 to Dole 's Senate and presidential campaign committees , more than they have given to any other current member of Congress . The ADM Foundation has contributed $160,000 to the Dole Foundation , a charitable organization established by the senator . Dole took three free trips to Midwest speaking engagements on ADM airplanes in 1983 . But by far the most lucrative contribution to Dole was ADM 's co-sponsorship ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three minute radio debate between Dole and Sen. Edward Kennedy , which Dole took part in from April 1984 until he announced his candidacy for President in November 1987 . Broadcast prime-time on 160 stations of the Mutual Broadcasting System , the show provided Dole with a sounding board that , had he had to pay for it , would surely have busted his campaign bank account . Mutual Broadcasting would not give an exact figure on the cost of sponsoring the show , but , according to spokesman John Gudelanis , " a thousand dollars a day would not be too far out of the range . " In addition , Gudelanis thought that the sponsors of " Face-Off " paid some of the production costs . At $1,000 a day , this unofficial contribution was worth $840,000 to Dole over three years . <p> Whatever his motivations , Dole always stands ready to do Archer Daniels 's bidding , even if it goes against the interests of his state . While it 's true that ethanol production does prop up corn prices somewhat , Kansas is much more a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since livestock feed , a by-product of ethanol production , competes with soybean meal . When a corn product like wet gluten feed enters the market , the demand for soybean meal is reduced . Every 100-million-bushel increase in ethanol-induced corn production causes an estimated twelve to thirteen cent decline in soybean prices per hundredweight . Dole 's support for corn farmers via gasohol , then , comes only at the expense of his state 's soybean farmers . Often , of course , farmers grow both crops , not realizing that the extra money they 're making on corn is depressing the price of their soybeans . Not incidentally , Archer Daniels , as a major processor of soybeans , gains from this decline in soybean prices . <p> Yet the major crop of Kansas is wheat . Kansas is the nation 's foremost wheat producer , and the grain accounts for three to four times the cash value of the state 's corn crop . And it is wheat farmers who have stood to lose the most from the Dole-Andreas ethanol protection . Dole pursued alcohol tariff legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade restrictions of its own . Had it done so , wheat would have been perhaps the first target , as Brazil is the world 's fourth greatest importer of the grain . Despite their senior senator 's best efforts , Kansas wheat farmers suffered no such retaliation . In late 1985 , however , they did n't fare so well when the Brazilian minister of industry and commerce , Roberto Gusmao , with the aid of the U.S. ambassador to Brazil Diego Acensio , proposed that the United States relax its import restrictions on Brazilian alcohol in exchange for any number of possible concessions on the part of Brazil . One suggestion was that Brazil buy the corn for its increased ethanol production from American farmers . Another was that it increase its wheat allocation from the United States . <p> Between a sudden drop in oil prices and therefore decreased attractiveness of gasohol , and intense lobbying , the deals fell through . Says Acensio , " My understanding was that they ran afoul of the objectives of Archer Daniels Midland . The minister came back crestfallen , convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dole involved ? Royal Daniel , a Washington , D.C. attorney who lobbied for the Brazilian government , believes he was . " How directly I just ca n't tell you . Dole followed very closely . ADM is one of his great benefactors , what with that Face-Off ' show and all . " <p> Furthermore , many corn farmers , in Kansas and elsewhere , are far from happy with the gasohol program . " The piggishness of ADM has caused a major political problem for the whole corn industry , " John Ford of the American Corn Growers Association told the Kansas City Star . " The corn industry , the politics of it , is controlled by one man and Bob Dole is his gofer on the Hill . " <p> Dole was the sponsor or co-sponsor of at least five bills in the crucial 1981-85 period that set or served to maintain sugar price support targets , although only two of the bills concerned sugar exclusively . Telling was Dole 's response to a request by Savannah Food and Industries in December 1985 for a presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing quotas so that U.S. sugar refiners could make high fructose syrup from the cheaper sugar . According to Alcohol Update , a publication of Information Resources , Inc. , " If a measure like this is adopted under the farm bill or through other means , Sen. Robert Dole has said that he would introduce legislation to nullify it . " <p> Ethanol , bastard of science and creation of politics , stands to gain the most from the alternative fuels section of the Clean Air Act . In negotiations the week before the House approved its version , pro-ethanol Energy and Commerce Committee members met with environmentalists from ethanol-producing states . Together they pushed through a compromise that would effectively mandate the use of MTBE or ethanol year-round in the nation 's nine ozone non-attainment areas and for the six coldest months in the forty-four carbon monoxide non-attainment areas beginning in 1992. ( n1 ) If the five most serious carbon monoxide areas do n't achieve attainment by 1994 they will effectively be required to use ethanol only , since only ethanol can reach the oxygen level required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D-N.M. ) , said the amendment would " give credibility to the growing ethanol industry , " as if a congressional edict should overrule scientific evidence . <p> Meanwhile , Sen. Tom Daschle ( D.S.D. ) has pushed through an amendment to the Senate bill that would effectively mandate MTBE or ethanol for high-ozone areas in the six coldest months , with effectively half of that share going to ethanol for high carbon monoxide areas . It seems to have mattered little to Richardson or Daschle that evidence shows that ethanol aggravates the ozone problem . Nor will this increased smog come cheaply . The Congressional Research Service estimates the extra 10-to-15-cent-per-gallon cost of the fuel in the nine non-ozone non-attainment areas alone would cost consumers in those cities $25 to $50 billion annually . Under certain circumstances , the cost could be as high as $100 billion . <p> The only other alternative fuel that has received serious lobbying is methanol . In 1988 , Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D-W.V. ) sponsored successful legislation to exempt alternative fuels from the Corporate Average Fleet Economy ( CAFE ) standards which mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , the manufacturer will be fined . The legislation serves as an incentive for the sale of alternative fuel vehicles . Rockefeller 's purpose could only have been to support the coal industry , which hopes to gain by the conversion of its product to methanol . Other lobbyists for methanol include the natural gas companies Hoerscht Celanese of West Germany and ICI Americas of the United Kingdom . <p> The final politically created fuel is reformulated gasoline , which exists primarily to allow the petroleum companies to assert that they are making progress in refining cleaner fuels and to stave off efforts to mandate the use of alternatives . It scores points with the media , which are generally critical of the petroleum industry , but has been ignored by Congress . Nevertheless , while the petroleum industry obviously has a stake in keeping as much of its market share as it can , the drawbacks of non-petroleum fuels make this political creature far more attractive than ethanol . <p> All of which brings us to another dirty little secret . According to the EPA , better engine design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the catalytic converter ) have cut emissions of volatile organic compounds from automobile tailpipes by 96 percent since 1970 . In fact , most of the volatile emissions that cause smog come from cars built before 1981 . But as a Brookings Institution study pointed out a few years ago , regulations that increase the price of owning or operating new cars only cause old-car owners to delay retiring their vehicles . Which is exactly what alternative fuels will do . <p> There are some advantages to some alternative fuels in some situations . As battery technology improves , electric cars may begin to outperform all internal combustion engine vehicles . Propane and natural gas may help reduce pollution in some areas , and have few drawbacks if used only for fleet vehicles . But for now and the near future , all the alternative fuels have serious disadvantages . Unfortunately , the House version of the 1990 Clean Air Act mandated the selling of 150,000 alternative fuel vehicles in California in the 1994 model year , and 300,000 per year for 1997 and after . Congress has not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get individual Californians to buy vehicles that cost more to purchase , will reduce driving range , may cost more to run , and would effectively curtail out-ofstate travel for fear of breakdowns where there are no mechanics trained to work on alternative fuel vehicles . <p> It might seem at first that alternative fuels could contribute significantly to lessening America 's dependence on imported oil . Indeed , the Department of Energy ( DOE ) has responded to the Iraqi crisis by calling for more ethanol production . But it 's important to understand that the U.S. is n't running out of oil . Petroleum reserves in the U.S. are estimated to be as high as 300 billion barrels , more than the known reserves of Saudi oil . What has happened is that much of the easiest oil to reach has been extracted , and the incentives for drilling consequently eliminated . Further , the 1986 tax reform severely curbed the depletion allowance and eliminated tax shelters that allowed many of the industry 's tax advantages to be passed on to investors . Like many U.S. companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work abroad . If Congress were to grant U.S. oil companies the tax breaks it gives ethanol producers  --  with the stipulation that it apply only to U.S. oil  --  domestic oil production would skyrocket and dependence on foreign oil would drop dramatically . Although the price for the subsidy would be enormous , it would be less so than pouring money into ethanol production . <p> The other reason for a lack of American drilling is the environmentalist movement 's success in getting large oil-fields declared off-limits . Environmentalists prefer to put emphasis on the development of non-hydrocarbon and non-nuclear sources of energy such as solar . Environmentalism 's success reminds us that politics is largely responsible for our dependency on imported oil , and that some of the same people agitating to reduce dependency are the ones who helped bring it about in the first place . V. OTHER ALTERNATIVES <p> One final dirty secret : cleaner fuel wo n't do as much good in cars , old or new , as a good tune-up or making owners who have intentionally disabled their pollution control systems fix them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Denver and a former Ford scientist , says that too much emphasis is being put on reducing low levels of emissions from essentially clean-running cars  --  either through alternative fuels or by further tightening up tailpipe emission standards  --  and that more emphasis should be put on cleaning up dirty cars . Gary Woodard 's Arizona study also found that " programs focusing on identifying and remedying high carbon monoxide emitters may be more cost-effective than programs that impact equally on all vehicles . " About half of all automobile pollution is emitted by only ten percent of cars ; cleaning them up would lead to rewards as great as getting the clean ones to run just a bit cleaner , an action Stedman compares to making a sharp pencil a little bit sharper . <p> Stedman and several colleagues have developed a device called FEAT ( for " Fuel Economy Automobile Test " ) which , when stationed by the side of the road , measures on-road emissions in about a second at a cost of 50 cents a reading . In combination with a videotape machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically reduce emissions at a fraction of the cost of alternative fuels or even present emissions testing programs . FEAT has been successfully tested in Colorado , California , and Illinois , and an amendment to the House Clean Air Act would mandate its use in non-attainment areas . <p> Stedman and his device show that the real hope for the future is in fresh alternative ideas . Gasoline  --  along with methanol , ethanol , propane , and natural gas  --  will eventually go the way of whale oil . And no one sees the writing on the wall better than the Arab oil nations , which invest heavily in U.S. solar energy research . Perhaps even now they 're planning for an Organization of Solar Panel Exporting Countries , or OSPEC . But the time for worry will come only after many years , when today 's events in the Persian Gulf are a distant memory . Until then , the fuels our cars use will have to be chosen according to which provides the optimum in price , performance , and pollution control . Sentimentalism and blind prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n1 ) To determine whether a city is a non attainment area , the carbon monoxide or ozone is measured hourly at stations spread strategically through the city . Eight consecutive hours are then averaged , and that average recorded . If the maximum percentage of particles is violated ( 9 per million of carbon monoxide , .12 per million of ozone ) , this is considered an " exceedence " day . It is also an exceedence day for carbon monoxide if the level of 35 parts per million is recorded in any given hour . The EPA tolerates one such day , but two or more such days put the city in non-compliance . Among other reasons , the standard is controversial because , as in the case of Denver , if only one monitor , located at the worst traffic spot , is triggered for two hours of non-compliance , the entire city can be branded as a high pollution area . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Michael Fumento <p> <p> Michael Fumento , author of The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS ( New Republic Books ) , lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
