Laurel Winter 's last story for us was " Fighting Gravity " back in September . She reports that much of her energy these days is going into her new passion , painting and that she 's working on an sf novel for kids . This new fantasy tells the story of a quiet young girl 's coming of age and of a special woman known as ... <p> THE FIRST TIME I MET SKY Eyes , I thought she was blind . Her eyes were clouded white-blue , with no black circles in the middle , no white background . I thought she was blind , and then she looked at me and saw that I was seven years old and my mother was sick with something that ate her until her arms were brown sticks and my father would n't admit it and I wanted everything to be back the way it was , but knew-even then-that it could never be that way again . I do n't know how I knew this , but I did . She also saw that I had been sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potion to cure my mother or , more likely , some soothing potion to help her die . This latter she gave me , a slender , black vial , accepting the single coin from my small , brown hand , but the knowledge in her cloudy eyes held me . She saw that we were just come to the village and not likely to move on . And she saw deeper - the strange patterns of thought in my child mind , that I had taken care to hide even from my mother . " Oh , Jamillah , the person you could be , " she said , touching my chin with a cool finger . " Are you brave enough ? Are you cold enough ? " I ran then , without words , but she did n't seem to mind . " You 'll come back , " she called . Never , I told myself , frightened in a way that made my very bones quiver beneath my flesh . How had she known my name ? I wanted to dash the vial of soothing potion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within it . I would have smashed it , too , but for the fact that I could also feel painful death whenever I touched my mother . Old knowledge , for a child of seven , that caught in my throat . Sometimes I did n't speak for days . I was the one who fed my mother the potion , a drop at a time . The neck of the vial was just large enough to admit my smallest finger , let it emerge , glistening . Her lips held what smile they could as I touched the finger to her tongue . Then her eyes would glaze slightly , as the pain left her . And a bit of her life went , too . The vial did n't last as long as she did . I could n't bear to give more than a single drop , could n't bear the sleep that so mimicked death when I gave her two drops in quick succession . She lingered and I was sent back to Sky Eyes with the empty vial . This time we had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking up the street with the black vial in my hands . People always talk as if children can not hear , or , if they do hear , can not understand . Since I had n't spoken for weeks now , and no one believed I would again , they did n't even bother to lower their voices . " That poor , strange child . " " What her parents are thinking , sending her to that witch .... " " Ah , but she 's a girl , so she should be safe . I do n't allow my son to even speak to that woman . " " What will happen to the child when the mother dies ? " By then my cold feet had taken me to the door of Sky Eyes 's hut . The black , empty vial gleamed in my hand . Before I could knock on the rough wood the door opened to me . " Come in , " she said . " No need to stand in the cold - or listen to poisonous gossip . " This last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least three of the gossipers . They walked swiftly away whispering to each other . She led me in to the flickering warmth , but my shivers did not decrease . Her eyes were clear , pale blue - winter sky blue - without the clouds that had drifted through them before . I moved my mouth to ask why , but the sounds had forgotten how to come out . No matter ; she knew my question . She gave the merest shrug . " No one knows , least of all I. Some say my mother spent too much time looking at the sky when she was carrying me inside , looking at the sky and wishing to be somewhere other than where she was . And then I was born and she was . " She paused for a bare moment and continued matter-of-factly . " My mother died when I was born . At least you 've had yours for seven years . " I stared at her . No matter how many people whispered about my mother 's impending death behind my back , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother gets better .... " Even my father , when he sent me for this soothing , killing potion , sent me with lies about medicine to make her strong , make her well . But I knew , and so did my mother , and so did Sky Eyes . I gravely held out the vial . " Poor child , " she said , taking it in a small , neat hand . " You could n't bear to end it quickly , could you ? " Pain filled me . " The best thing is usually the hard thing , " she said . She went to a stained wooden table and anchored the vial in a lump of reddish clay . She stuck a small funnel into the slender black neck . " If it 's too easy - like telling a child her mother will live instead of admitting she 'll be dust before the month is out - " She poured a thin , gleaming stream into the mouth of the funnel , a mere thread of liquid . " If it 's too easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as soon as she 'd begun , when even an inexperienced child could tell the vial was nowhere near full . She took the funnel out and placed it in a basin of water . She rinsed her hands and dried them on her gray skirt . " Can you remember that ? " she whispered , seating the stopper firmly before handing the vial back to me . " The best thing is usually the hard thing . " Traces of clay marked the black . I did n't have to nod to show her I would always remember ; she knew . She closed her eyes and was an ordinary woman , tired , but with traces of beauty that nothing could erase . " Go now , " she said . " Be quick or the cold will eat your feet . " She had n't mentioned payment , and I scurried for the door , half afraid she would demand a coin I did n't have , but she was silent . As I left though , she whispered , just loud enough for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't linger on the way home , although the tiny vial felt heavy to me , as though it contained an entire world . My father let me into our room , which had one bed , continuously occupied by my mother . When he slept , which was n't often , he crept next to the wall and made himself as thin as possible . I slept next to the fire atop a folded blanket and beneath my mother 's cloak . The room smelled sick , stale , hopeless , but somehow the cloak had retained a warm , sheep smell . Aside from the clothes we wore , our few belongings were stacked near the wall , still packed in bundles . Something about that made me uneasy , but Father could not be bothered to think about them . We had been traveling toward Shaboor when Mother 's sickness had demanded we stop ; he still maintained that we would be going on soon , soon , when she was a little stronger . He spent all his time with her , stroking her face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot when cool did no good . Nothing did any good . She just lay there dying . She was awake now , her lips drawn back in a grimace of pain , too weak even to weep . " You have the medicine , Jamillah ? " Father asked . " She gave it to you ? " I nodded . " Quickly , then . The waiting is so hard for her . " I went toward the bed , but I could n't force my feet to move quickly . The best thing is usually the hard thing . My father gave me a little shove . " She 's waiting . " I stood by the bed and looked for her smile , but it had been eaten away by the pain . The lines in her face belonged to a woman who had lived her whole life and was ready to die . The best thing ... I lifted the vial and she moved her lips . I moved my own , trying to bring words out . Goodbye . I love you . Please tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . I leaned over and kissed her wasted cheek . The hard thing ... I removed the stopper and tilted the vial , watching the thick , shining potion trickle into her mouth . Father watched me from the middle of the room . He knew what I was doing , but he just stood and watched until it was too late and then he ran to the bed with a cry and snatched the vial . " What are you doing ? You are giving her too much . " He slapped me , hard , which he had never done before . I buried myself in the wool of Mother 's cloak and let my tears lead me into sleep . SOMETIME in the night , while I slept , my mother died and my father left . I awoke to angry voices in the hall . " - gone and she 's dead and that child without a tongue in her head . What are we supposed to do with her ? " I did n't want to open my eyes , but I could n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her hands arranged across her chest . The bundles were gone . All that was left was me and the cloak I slept under . And the black , empty vial on the night table . The fire was out ; the air against my face cold . I wanted to silence my ears as well as my voice , but the argument in the hall continued to invade . " She could sweep up and scrub the pots perhaps . " " I will not have her here ! Do you know what she did ? " " She 's a mere child . " The fat man who did his wife 's bidding ; he 'd slipped me sweets before when she was n't looking . It was the wife , the innkeeper herself , who hissed now . " She killed her own mother . " Suddenly there was no warmth in the cloak , no warmth left in my body . I began to shiver violently . " Now , you ca n't know that . " " When I was up to start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she done , what has she done ? " and then this morning the woman is dead and the daughter left behind with the empty poison bottle . Maybe we could sell her to pay the bill for the burial and the room . " There was still no warmth in the world , but I stood and drew the cloak around me . It dragged on the rough floor . I walked past the bed that held my silent mother and went to the window . It opened easily , I knew , for we had frequently tried to air the room of the sick smell - never successfully - despite the winter . Our room was on the ground floor , looking into a narrow alley . I pulled myself up on the frame and swung my legs through . The cloak caught on a loose nail . When I pulled it free , a long curl of wool ripped off . Then I was gone , leaving my mother to the cold . I do n't know what the innkeepers said when they found I was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he that he was n't forced to deal with the idea of selling me , and she that she was n't forced to deal with me at all . I had never come out through the alley before . The backs of the buildings-unpainted , rough-were much different than the fronts . The wind whistled between them , diving through the gaps in my cloak . I did n't want to come out just in front of the inn , where they might see me , so I ran along the alley until it spit me onto a street . Thin ice broke under my bare feet , cut my ankles . I was crying , but silently , tears freezing on my eyelashes and cheeks . By the time I 'd stumbled around and found myself in familiar surroundings , my teeth were chattering so hard that I could n't have spoken had I been otherwise able to . By the time I reached Sky Eyes 's door , I could barely walk . I crept up the steps , and fell against the door . My feet were numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't even knock , but lay there thinking that I should . The wind burrowed down the gaping neck of the cloak . Too cold . Too penetrating . The door opened and I sprawled into warmth . Sky Eyes lifted me . " I 'm sorry that you had to do what you did , " she said , " but I 'm not sorry you did it . " She carried me to the fire , shutting out the cold with a push of one bare foot . She wore only a loosely tied robe ; her grip on me shifted it from one shoulder and I could see the swell of one breast and its brown nipple . Her eyes were golden and rose and violet , a sunset giving over to dusk . I was too deadened by cold to be embarrassed . " Who is it ? " asked a young male voice . Over her shoulder , I saw one of the village boys , wrapped in a bedsheet . His shoulders were bare and sweaty and so was the rest of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , impatient at the interruption . She set me down on the hearth stone . " Her name is Jamillah . " She was touching my feet now , although I could barely feel it . She frowned . " Her mother just died and her father has abandoned her . She 's going to live with me and be my student . " She pulled her gaping robe shut . " Put your clothes on , " she told him . " I 'm done with bed for the time being . " " But - he said , and then did as he was told . It made me angry in a way that I did n't understand at all , that he would just stop in the middle of that curious dance adults did , with hardly an argument , merely because she said so . I think even then I realized how hard it would be to defy her myself . She ignored him then , although I watched him through my half  --  frozen lashes , as he awkwardly struggled into his pants , dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my father in the mornings or evenings , getting into and out of the bed he shared with my mother before she sickened , but never a well-muscled young man , still hard with passion . It made me uneasy , but still I looked . Sky Eyes took hot water from a kettle near the fire and mixed it with cold in a large , shallow bowl , then dripped something light green and fragrant into it . " Sit with your back to the wall here , " she told me . I ended up with my feet and hands in the bowl , knees bent up to my chest and the bowl directly before me . The scent of the water and the pain of returning sensation in my hands and feet made me feel as if I were floating through a burning sea . The boy came up behind Sky Eyes as she was dampening a cloth in the water . He ran his hands down her back . " Go , " she said . " I 've no time for you now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him one steady look of her sunset eyes , which were almost entirely gone to violet now . He left without another word . She sighed . " I do like to bed that boy , " she said , " when it 's convenient . Ah , well , he 'll be back . " My pain was not enough to conceal my embarrassment and surprise . She turned the steady gaze on me . " I am not used to having children about , " she said , " although the villagers would have that I am despoiling their male children . In my mind , there is nothing evil or dirty about sex , as long as all participants are willing and reasonably grown up . There is more harm done in half the marriage beds in this village than is imagined in mine . I will not pretend that I am a celibate priestess . " She bathed my face with the cloth . " So if a lusty young man knocks at the door , let him in . " Her mischievous grin faded into total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ever touch you against your will , you have my permission to kill them . " I burst into shaking tears at that statement , and Sky Eyes held me , oblivious to the water spilled on her robe . " You did what you had to- no , not what you had to ; what you could . You did the hard thing , the best thing , and now her pain is over . " I cried harder , clinging to her with hands that burned with ice . I wanted to hear that it was n't my fault , that my mother had n't died at my hands . Sky Eyes drew back and held my shoulders . " You did it . Neither of us will pretend otherwise . If you do not accept that , I will bundle you up and carry you back to the innkeepers to be sold for debts . You choose . " My tears died within me , and the last of my childhood . I nodded . " I 'm sorry it 's so , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . I do n't know yet if your mother would have thanked you or not , and your father certainly did not , but I think that you will someday believe you did the best thing . " She wiped away my tears with the fragrant cloth , examined my hands and feet . " Well , you wo n't be running away for a day or two . Let 's get you into my bed now - since I 'm not using it at the moment . " She winked one gray-violet eye and carried me to a big bed . The four posts had lengths of black silk tied to them . She deftly unknotted them . I must have looked as curious as I felt . " Sometimes , if you wish it or your partner does - " she began , placing the cloth in a covered basket . Her voice trailed off and a faint flush came to her cheeks . " Never mind for now . " Later that day , Sky Eyes pulled boxes of dusty bottles out of a small storage room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that covered three of the walls : yellow , with slender green lizards printed on it ; solid purple ; red and blue striped . Only one wall was left to show cool , gray stone with a wooden door in the center of it . She had no other bed , so she formed a pallet of blankets and pillows on the floor . " Here , " she said , carrying me in and setting me down . " Birdy has a nest now . And I have my bed back - just in case I should need it . " There were hooks on the back of the door that had held dried herbs ; the air in the tiny room still smelled of them . On the highest hook she hung the cloak which was the only thing inherited from my mother . " I 'll be going out now , " she said , running one hand along the wool lining . " If any beautiful male creatures come by , tell them to wait a few minutes for me - or a number of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone . I had never had a room of my own before . She was gone for some hours , during which I drowsed in and out of dream and thought , not always sure which was which . The vial , held by my winter-kissed hands , approached my mother 's lips . I tried to stop , but the hands moved of their own will , tilting the vial , pouring- and then the face changed and it was Sky Eyes , her eyes as night black as the vial itself . " The best thing , " her voice a mere breath , " is the hard thing . Is it so hard to forgive yourself ? " And then my hands were holding the vial to my own lips and I was drinking a deep , endless drop . And crying . I had n't heard her return , but my cries brought her in to me . " I do n't know what to do , " she said , taking me into her arms . Her breath held the scent of wine ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Comfort is not a coin I am often called to give . " She let me rest against her shoulder for a moment and then set me back in the pillows . " I ca n't take your pain away and would n't if I could . No comfort now , but someday you will be able to use it . " My sniffling subsided , not because of her less than tender words , but because I had wom out . Too much had happened in too little time . My eyes drifted shut . Sky Eyes touched my face . " I hate them , " she said , her voice hard and vicious . " I hate them all . " The next day she slathered my hands and feet with gel and wrapped them with strips of cloth , wound round and round . " You are too big to carry far , " she said , " but I do n't think you can - or should - walk yet . Stand up for a moment . " I did , biting my lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me , fastening the throat clasp , and put on her own . Then she crouched down , facing away from me . " Climb onto my back . " It was n't easy , with my awkward , bundled limbs and two cloaks to deal with , but she finally staggered to a standing position . " It 's a good thing you 're only seven , " she said . " At twelve you may well have to carry me . " She had to let go of one of my legs to open the door , and I almost fell off . She started laughing . " This will give them something to gossip about . " She shut the door and grabbed me again , readjusting before she tottered off into the wind . When we reached the low stone building , she pushed the door open without knocking . I had had no idea of our destination , but this place , cold by design , revealed its nature by the bodies stretched or twisted or curled up on the narrow benches that hung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where the corpses of those unfortunate enough to die in winter were kept until the ground thawed . I wanted to run on my bandaged feet , but Sky Eyes carried me to the low bench where my mother lay . She let go . I tried to cling to her , but my bandaged hands gave out and I slipped to the floor beside my dead mother . A thin layer of frost covered her skin and clothes and hair , sealed her to the bench . " Look at her expression , " Sky Eyes said softly . I made myself look . Under the frost , her mouth was slack , her teeth barely showing . Not drawn into that grimace of pain . Her hands were still arranged across her chest ; my father 's work , no doubt . He had comforted the dead and left me huddled on the floor . A sudden rage flared within me . He had known she was dying , had known that the pain easer was a life drainer , had known that I would end up killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then blamed me for it . A rough howl escaped me . I ran my hands over my mother 's face , her hands , her frost-coated hair . Tears melted trails in her white frost shroud . " No , " I said , my voice thick and awkward . " I did n't mean to . " " You did , " said Sky Eyes , looking at me through pink-tinted dusk . " You made a choice , a decision , and carried it out . You acted-though it was perhaps the hardest thing you will ever do in your life . Poor child , that you were called upon to do the hardest thing so young . " I hated her , for not letting me lie even to myself , or to the dead . At the same time , her words had a curiously lightening effect . How hard could life be , if I had already done the hardest thing ? I had yet to learn that the many smaller hard things , common as dust , were more wearing than the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let me discover it myself , in the years to follow . " I 'm sorry , " I said , laying my face on my mother 's cold cheek . This time Sky Eyes did not contradict me . WHEN I HAD cried myself out and we were both shivering violently , it was time to leave the death house . I had to crawl up on the edge of my mother 's bench to get on Sky Eyes 's back , so stiff and clumsy were we both . found my gaze drawn to the other bodies : several old ones who had found this last winter of their lives too harsh ; a young woman with her dead child clasped upon her chest , both pulled into death by the birth ; a large bearded man with terribly whitened hands and an odd , peaceful expression . Sky Eyes nodded toward him . " They say that freezing to death makes one warm and sleepy , that there is no pain . I can feel that in him . Can you ? " Even as she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost against my will , my mind threaded itself into his death . Yes ; it was a comfortable death , as was the death of the old woman on the bench beneath him . I jerked away from the wrenching denial of the young woman who held her child only after her life had bled out of her . Sky Eyes stopped . She turned her head and looked back over her shoulder at me . " Do you want to feel her death ? " I held very still , afraid that the shivering within me would be interpreted as assent or denial . Would it be a terrible thing to know ? Would I regret it ? Yet I could not refuse . I nodded and let my mind touch the last minutes of my mother 's life . Release from pain . Regret that there would be no more minutes of life , but acceptance that it had to be that way to escape the consuming pain . Shock and sorrow at the knowledge in my eyes . Then nothing . Life flowing from her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her . I did n't notice that Sky Eyes had even started walking until we were out of the death house and down the street . Tears froze on my cheeks . " You 'd be better off not crying now , " she said . " Or your face will freeze and the frozen-hearted bitches of the village will be imagining that I am torturing you . " I stopped crying and let my head rest on her left shoulder . Perhaps it was torture , but it was the torture of sudden , rapid growth . I fell asleep and did n't wake until she let me slide to the step outside her door . " You are heavy , " she said , opening the door with hands that shook . " Perhaps it is different when a woman has raised a baby from the first ; the strength in her back and arms would grow along with the child . I must be an imbecile to begin this way . " Her words would have stung had she not , even as she was speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knelt beside me and stirred the embers with a stick which burst into flame . She built the fire up to a rage and leaned on one arm , looking at me with those summer blue eyes . " What a first lesson : how to speak with the dead . There 's no doubt ; I 'm an imbecile . " She affected the childish expression of one who had but a small portion of wit . My mouth twitched into a smile and she dropped the pretense . " Ah , you must have been starved for humor if my poor performance is enough for you . I suppose I will have to do , flaws and all . Shall we have soup for supper ? Or breakfast , I guess it would be . " I had never had soup for breakfast before , but then I had never listened to the dead before breakfast either . Of the two , I preferred the soup . It was not the last time I ate soup for breakfast , not the last time I listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing the proper foods to eat at the proper times . Or perhaps she did know and just refused to obey the rules that the rest of the women followed : gruel or night-soaked grain in the morning , a hearty midday meal of freshly baked bread , meat , whatever fruits or vegetables could be found ; soup and leftover bread , maybe a sweet , in the evening . We were just as likely to start baking bread near sundown and eat it outdoors when the rest of the village was abed , butter dripping from our fingers as we pointed out stars to one another . Sometimes , stars in her eyes echoed those overhead . Most frequently , we had no formal meals , with each of us foraging through the supplies whenever hunger bit . I ate a ten-day 's worth of sweeting once , but Sky Eyes said nothing . She did n't have to ; my stomach spoke more firmly than any reprimand . More than that , though , there was an odd restraining factor to such freedom . The mere thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in our pantry there was little of the luster that the forbidden holds . The luster glimmered on the knowledge she withheld for vague future times when I was " older . " That curse of children - to be forever too young for whatever is currently tempting . It did not occur to me that the opportunities she did give me - listening to the dead at seven ; being told openly about sex as a fine , natural thing long before my woman hair began to grow ; eating or sleeping as my body required it , not to the schedule of some adult - were far beyond the rights of the other village children . They despised me . Sky Eyes never suggested I go out to play with them , but neither did she discourage me the first time I thought to . It was spring of the first year with her , my hands and feet fully healed from the winter kiss . A group of children were floating chips of wood along the wagon tracks that had filled with water the night before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved to have them out of the house after a long winter underfoot that the washing up task ahead was being completely ignored . Even the cleanest were spattered and freckled with mud . I looked from the window to the table where Sky Eyes was sorting herbs . " Go if you wish , " she said . There was more she wanted to say , but she only tightened her lips and let me discover some things for myself . The taste of mud . The feel of a bony foot on the back of my neck , pressing my face into a deep rut until I could n't hold my breath any longer . The deliberate release , after I had been choking for several seconds , that would not allow me to believe it had been any sort of accident . The sudden quietness of children who are no longer playing but have moved into the work of being cruel . For some , cruelty was no difficult task . The tall girl who tripped me as I went past her to see the boats and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the worst . I was more angry , though , at those who were clearly uneasy , the ones who formed the words and thoughts in their minds - we should n't be ; let her go ; do n't - and yet said nothing . When I struggled up to my knees , sputtering and coughing , the front of my dress completely blackened , they were all standing around me in a ragged circle . " She 's a dummy , " said the tall girl . " She 's not even crying . " I touched my face . Amazingly , she was right . " She probably ca n't , " said someone else . I did n't see who . " I saw her crying . " This was a boy with black curls almost hiding his eyes . He spoke in a whisper . " I was looking out the window . She was riding on the witch 's back in the cold and crying . " " Really , Ketrin ? " He nodded , his beautiful hair dipping down . " Witches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe she 's not a witch . " " That 's stupid , " said another . " My father says there are no witches , just healers . " " She 's not crying now , is she ? " asked the tall girl , ignoring the comment about healers . She stepped closer . " She 's a witch now . The innkeeper says she killed her mother . I heard her tell my mother . " They drew back a fraction , but apparently fear was not enough to overcome curiosity . Or cruelty . I did n't move . This was not a time to be angry , not a time to leap up and claw at her with my muddy fingers . She was too big and the others were on her side - or at least not on mine . My whole body and mind were tense and alert . I made my face smooth and calm and just looked at her . She did n't expect that . I sensed her confusion ; a second later she stopped . " She 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go slide on the hill . " She turned and ran off , making sure her first step sprayed dirty water on me . The others followed her . About half of them splashed me . Most of the rest avoided my eyes . Only Ketrin hesitated , giving me an apologetic smile before he left . I hated him most . I knelt in the mud for a long time , until the mud drying on my face made me feel as if my skin would crack and fall off if my expression changed . It was n't until a cart came sploshing toward me , the driver yelling obscenities , that I moved . Sky Eyes said nothing when I came in . She pulled the mud-caked dress off over my head and helped me into the big tub , already filled with gently steaming water . She dipped up handfuls of water and poured them over my face and hair . As the mud loosened , so did something within me , and I began to sob . Then her whispers were pouring over me as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . " Tears poured from her cloud gray eyes until her face was as wet as mine . Witches did cry - if that was what she was - just not in front of people like the tall girl and the boy with the scar . People like Ketrin . I never did go to the village school . Sky Eyes did n't laugh at the school teacher when he came by to inform us that I should be educated . At the time , I was measuring out - to the drop - the various ingredients that made up a sleeping draught . The directions were written in Sky Eyes 's neat hand : one part this to three parts that , and so on . She had told me to read through the recipe , see that I had all of the components to hand , and make as much as possible , with the limiting factor being whatever there was the least of . I was nine . " Could any of your students do this ? " Sky Eyes asked . " Certainly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youngish man , very tall , who had lived in the village for only a few years . To my knowledge , he had never before been to our house , but I thought by the way Sky Eyes had greeted him , how she had held his hand for just a moment longer than necessary when he 'd offered it , that he would be hack " Without supervision at each step ? " Sky Eyes took a sip of tea and looked at the man over the rim of her cup . " And would you then drink the sleeping draught , keeping in mind that it contains bone leaf , which - in larger proportion  --  makes one sleep to the point of death ? " I continued my task , measuring and mixing , but my hands were suddenly cold . Bone leaf . Sleep to the point of death . I knew how to make the potion in the black vial now , as well as administer it . The teacher gave her a rueful grin , as if to concede the point . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " but there are other things one learns at school - " Sky Eyes set her cup down and her eyes went stormy . " Things like which hurts most , the nose bleed after a slap or the soul ache after some vicious name-calling ? Would you really have her learn that ? " The teacher dropped his face into his hands . " No , no , you 're right . I would try to protect her but it would not be enough . She would be hurt and I would be guilty . " He looked up at me . " You have a fine mind ; I can see that . I would have liked having you in my school but chances are you would not have liked it . Is your potion done yet ? " I had just begun funneling the liquid into a rack of clean , gray vials , with the rune for sleep scratched on the front of each one . I nodded , and he handed me a coin . " For when I have problems sleeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleased by this evidence of faith . He stood , and Sky Eyes did as well . " You must come back , " she said . " If you are having problems sleeping . " The look she gave him , her eyes half-lidded storms , accented her meaning . Even at age nine , I could sense his mixture of apprehension and desire . Desire won . He held out his hand again , although that was less common than doing so on greeting . Sky Eyes extended her own and their fingers met in something that was more than half caress . Yes , he would be here soon , making sounds that filtered through the stone walls of my room . THE SCHOOL MASTER did come by , always late at night , when he supposed I would not know . He did n't know just how fine my mind was , that it could pick up his thoughts and emotions as well as precisely measure out the most complicated potion . I sometimes saw him on the street when I was out on errands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyes was right , though . He could n't have protected me from the other children . They tormented me at every opportunity , flinging stones , animal droppings , names . My legs grew long and I discovered that this gave me a speed which few of them could match . For a while , the girl who had tripped me the first time could catch me , but it was n't long before she turned her attention from childhood cruelty to flirting with the older boys . Ketrin never became my defender , but he at least never participated in the viciousness . If he was alone when he saw me , he would greet me . I stopped hating him . Other than Sky Eyes and some of her men , he was the closest I had to a friend - I could n't afford to hate him . At nine , my fascination with sex was tinged with disgust . The disgust did not last . The fascination did . I kept the hinges on my bedroom door well-greased , and sometimes slipped out to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time . They were mostly - but not all - young . Occasionally , one of the older widowers or unmarried bachelors came to the door , ostensibly for some potion or other . She told me this after the widower who ran the mill had been by . I watched them from the space between the table and some crates . Through the slats in the crate , I could see them stroking each other and plunging and shuddering . " No , " she said , softly , with a catch in her voice . " Oh , no . " But it did not sound like a command to stop . His silver hair fell over her face like rain at dusk . He slid his hips from side . to side , over her , slowly , slowly . Her fingers clutched the sheet and she arched her back , and then they were moving together , explosively . My own fingers moved between my legs . I did n't know why it felt good , only that it did . Maybe I gasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I watched from . At any rate , after he had gone , with one lingering touch and an even longer kiss , she called me out from my hiding place . I was eleven . I had been there for four years , long enough to know that she would not hit me , no matter what I did . Still , my stomach quivered as I stood up . She wore the same silk robe as she had the day I came to her door half  --  frozen . " Are you satisfied ? " she asked . " Did you see what you needed to see ? " Whatever I had expected , it was n't this . Her cheeks flushed faintly . " It must seem strange to you , but it is n't . You 'll discover it soon , whenever you are ready . " My hands came up to my chest and touched the tiny breasts there . It did n't seem possible that I would ever have a woman 's figure , even though I already had the beginnings of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . I made myself speak , my voice hoarse with disuse . " Touch yourself ? " Heat rushed to my face . Sky Eyes laughed . " Oh yes . When there is no one in my bed- or there is , and he 's inept and clumsy . Not everyone you bed will know how to please you , so you 'd better know how to please yourself . Here , I have a gift for you . " She darted back to her bed and took something out of a wooden chest . A long , curled feather , orange and yellow , streaked with blue . " The tailfeather of a shennikan , " she said , handing it to me . " I like to stroke myself with one , my arms and legs and breasts . And especially my throat . " My fingers curled around the slender shaft of the feather . I must have looked surprised , because she laughed again . " Of course I touch my sex parts - but that does n't mean I ignore the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring myself pleasure just thinking of hot , young bodies and lengths of silk - " She turned bright pink . " I never imagined a conversation like this , though . " She swatted my behind . " Take your feather and your fantasies and go to bed now . " Another question , though . I hesitated . " Old ones ? " " Ah , sometimes they 're the best . The young have the energy - but the old have knowledge . They know how to touch and move to please a woman . At least the ones I invite into my bed . " She looked at me seriously . " Be careful who you invite into yours , when you are ready to do so . Search them for sickness , in body or mind . And I will not take a man who has a wife . " She slapped her forehead . " What am I saying-telling one who has n't had her blood yet not to bed married men . You poor child , to have me for .... " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a mother . I had never called her mother , which was n't unusual , as I rarely spoke . More importantly , though , I had not allowed myself to think of her as a mother . I was n't sure she would welcome that . Now that I knew she would , I was n't sure that I could . It pleased me though , to have the option . " Thank you , " I whispered . " You 're welcome . " As I was closing my door , she said , " Just be discreet . " Was she giving me permission to watch ? I did n't know and I did n't ask . There was too much going on in my head , not to mention my body . Men were not the only visitors , though . The same women that despised Sky Eyes , that gossiped about her and futilely forbade their sons to come near her , they came for abortifacients , joint easers , the silvery drink that brought one out of a dark mood , a dozen other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sneaking through the alleys and tapping the back door with shaking fingers . If we sensed the visit soon enough , one of us would race to the door and open it just as she raised her hand . Mean perhaps , but it enhanced belief . For some reason , those who sought Seeing or Knowing were always women . Did the men not know ? Not believe ? We talked about it whenever a woman left , the knowledge of the vision uneasy in her mind . Sky Eyes was of the opinion that men thought they knew and saw everything already . I thought perhaps they did n't know we could do such things . Seeing and Knowing ... the women did n't really understand either . They came with simple , specific questions : Will I have a child ? Yes or no . Once though , when the answer was yes , we both got the dreadful image of a daughter with brain enough to breathe and no more . That time , Sky Eyes shook her head sadly . " No child this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tincture to help you deal with this pain . " The brew also contained a ridding potion . There was no half-dead baby born to that young woman . When will my husband return from the high lakes ? Never , alas . But we did n't tell her that he had taken up with a mountain woman , that they laughed when they thought of her , waiting back in the foothills . Instead we let her keep the warmer image of his body floating in the clear , cold water of the lakes , fallen in returning to her . Seeing and Knowing . But not telling all . Perhaps it was good that the men did not come , and the women infrequently . Seeing and Knowing was not precise and simple and clearcut , as was the brewing of potions . We were kept busy gathering the ingredients in the fields and forests , along streambanks , past the tree line of the nearby mountains . Or trading for the more exotic substances that the traveling peddlers brought through . There was one , a small man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as black as shadows who always spent an extra day or two in the village , much of it in Sky Eyes 's bed , with scent sticks burning in a smoky circle . She smiled whenever she saw him leading his long-necked pack beast , its mane fluttering with bright ribbons . After he left , she always cried . His name was Ta , unusual in this area , and he spoke with a strange lilt to his voice , peppering his speech with words from another language . I could n't always figure out the meaning from context , but I did n't care . He called me jami-bird and measured himself against me , back to back , on every visit . At eleven , my head was already even with his , although he teased me that it was my hair that made me seem so tall . He was fascinating , and in my fantasies I most frequently imagined that Ta would be my first lover , small and dark , singing to me in his rich voice as he sang to Sky Eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I WAS FIFTEEN , or nearly that anyway . Sky Eyes had gone climbing for bone leaf , which was found only above the tree line , in the shadows of boulders where pockets of soil had collected . It was used in many of our potions , from the sleeping potions and pain-killers to the abortifacients and life-drainers . Normally we went together , but my adolescence was testing us both , and she had stalked off at daylight with an extra collecting bag , enough food for two days , and a blanket . " Do n't expect me until tomorrow , " she 'd snapped . I had stared at her sullenly , thinking fierce , uncaring thoughts , watching her struggle to open the door with too full hands . Not offering to help . She did n't say it - I 'll give her that- but her mind did play with the thought : why did 1 take her in ? Part of me wanted to fly back to that winter day and tug myself in the wrong direction , whisper words of discouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Maybe if I had been close with some of the others who were clumsily groping between being children and adults , adept at neither , I would have realized that such conflict was normal . Part of growing up . What had to happen on the way . But I did not , and neither did Sky Eyes , who had grown up without her own mother and was as isolated from the rest of the village as I was . I sat on the bench , smoldering with anger and resentment , a tall girl with slender limbs , ordinary brown eyes . When the knocker sounded , I almost did n't answer . My mind was so busy turning over my misfortunes that I had no idea who had come . Probably another woman who needed soul or belly cramps eased . Or one of the village elders , aching for some joint salve . But I knew better than to let my tiff with Sky Eyes interfere with business , so I dragged myself to the door and arranged my face in a neutral expression - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one of the young men ; I did n't know his name . He drew back when he saw me , surprise almost palpable . And desire . For him , right then , no one existed other than Sky Eyes . " Is she here ? " he asked . " I need a - a potion . " I just looked at him , his desire igniting the same within me . He was taller than I , but just by a little , with light hair and skin . The neck of a vial glinted between his fingers . I could almost feel his hand on my breast . I opened the door further and he came in , looking around for Sky Eyes , not seeing me . All I wanted to do was make him see me . Make him want me . I touched my hair , felt smooth silkiness rather than tangles . Yes , I had combed it this morning : deep brown , almost black , with more than a touch of wild curl . Would he see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would he want to stroke my brown skin ? I closed the door behind him and he looked at me . " Where is she ? And then he looked again , seeing me , remembering things he had heard . " Ah , you 're the girl who does n't talk . " I wanted to talk . I opened my lips and took a breath , but no words would come out . " Is Sky Eyes here ? " he asked again , watching for the reply this time . I reluctantly shook my head . " Oh , " he said . His disappointment cut through the stillness that inhabited my throat . " Wait , " I whispered . With a boldness that astounded me I reached out and took the vial from his hand . Plain clay brown , but the rune scratched on the front of it-the symbols for male and female intertwined - meant that it had once held aphrodisiac . I felt my cheeks heat up . The aphrodisiac was in the storeroom where I slept , behind the lizard-printed cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could I do this ? I gestured for him to follow me . In the small room , I could feel his breath on my shoulder as I lifted the cloth aside and reached for the bottle of aphrodisiac . I took off the stopper with a practiced curl of my little finger that allowed me to use both hands and not set the glass stopper down . Inside , I was shaking like pinch leaves in a breeze , but my hands were steady . Aphrodisiac was a thin , sweet potion , easy to pour . I filled the vial and handed it to him , uncorked . Then , while he was still watching me , I tilted my head back and poured some from the bottle into my mouth . His breath caught . He was seeing me , seeing the jumbled pillow bed on the floor , the open vial in his own hand . I set the bottle back on the shelf , replaced the stopper , let the cloth fall back into place . Desire burned in me , fanned into flame by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , be touched . " Should I drink it ? " he asked , his voice low . My eyes said yes . He heard . I felt light and heavy at the same time , unsure if I was about to fall down or float to the ceiling . I dropped to my knees on the bed , my skirt pooling around me . He followed . Sky Eyes had told me there might be pain the first time , and there was , but not much . The touching . His mouth on mine . The passion running inside me . When we were spent , he pulled his trousers on and covered me with a blanket the color of autumn leaves . " That was fine , " he said , his voice lingering on the last word . " I must be going now . " He shyly held the vial out for a refill on the aphrodisiac . I wrapped the blanket around myself and stood up , suddenly awkward with my bare shoulders and wild hair . Pouring was more difficult with my elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , but I managed . " Well , " he said , " I must be going . " He handed me two coins , for the two fillings of the vial , and then he was gone . I danced around , tripped on the trailing edge of the blanket and fell on my jumbled bed . I laughed and cried and touched myself to see if I felt different . Yes , there was a difference . I was n't a girl anymore . It was late the next morning when Sky Eyes returned , pale bone leaf protruding from her collecting bags , grassy blanket slung over her shoulder , shoes scuffed and dusty . Her expression was wary when she entered , but it changed almost immediately . " Who was it ? " she asked softly . I did n't know his name , I realized , but she caught his image from my mind and nodded . " Rashi . A good lover . Not terribly imaginative , but .... " I could n't look at her any more , embarrassed almost to tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed him , how he liked to run his fingers down a woman 's sides , letting the touch trail off at the hips . Her tight voice made me look up . " This is going to be more difficult than I ever imagined . " Her face was pale , with red spots on her cheeks . " I do n't think I can talk now . " She dropped the bags of bone leaf on the stone floor and walked to her bedroom , her back very straight . She was jealous , I realized with a shock that dried incipient tears . She could n't deal with a young woman who was actually going to act on the theories of sexuality she had spouted so glibly to a child . I picked up the discarded bone leaf and rinsed it in a bowl of clean water , being careful to handle it by the dry stems and not immerse my hands . It was more poisonous when swallowed , but it could cause a certain deadness in the fingers , and an air of confusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I clipped the bone leaf to a drying string . My thighs felt sore from the previous morning 's activities , which gave me a rather perverse pleasure . I carefully lifted the bowl of tainted water and carried it to the back . We had a special place where we poured such things , on a deep bed of gravel which we covered with a board to keep birds and animals  --  including the human kind - from being affected , inadvertently or otherwise . Sometimes , children would sneak into the fenced yard and snatch pebbles , which they dared each other to suck on . The board deterred them little , but Sky Eyes insisted . I had just replaced the board when I heard the door open behind me . I looked and saw Sky Eyes holding a mug . " Thank you for hanging the bone leaf , " she said . " You should drink this now . " I took the mug and sniffed . " To ensure that you will not have a child . " The liquid was sweet , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sky Eyes picked the blossom from a bird flower . Yellow pollen clung to her fingers . We used the pollen in a grainy potion for head pain , the pink  --  tipped petals in a mixture for burning that produced a calming aroma . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I did n't know I would feel this way - and I do n't know what I 'm going to do about it . I 'm not used to not knowing . " She gave a short , rueful laugh . " Maybe I could brew myself a potion . Or one for you , to turn you back into a child , and keep you one . " I tried to find a smile , failed . She looked at me again , her eyes tinted the yellow of sunrise turning to day . " No , you 're not a child and will never be again . So I will deal with you as a woman . If a man comes for me , he comes for me . Not you . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understand ? " I understood , and was sullen all over again . All the men and boys who came for Sky Eyes were not to be touched or teased or invited to my bed . Who would come for me , anyway ? Ketrin . My almost friend . His body had lengthened and strengthened , but the black curls had not changed . And neither had the smiles he gave me : apologetic smiles that I rarely returned . I got the feeling that he still saw me as a skinny , mud-blackened seven-year-old who would not cry , no matter how much she wanted to . Two days after Sky Eyes returned , he came . I opened the door , as Sky Eyes was in back , checking the darkberry stems we had set out to sun dry . Ketrin stood there , his smile more tentative than usual . " Ah , hello , " he said , beginning to extend his hand , faltering , dropping it to his side . " I 've come for a - potion . " His face reddened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You might be too busy . " I truly did n't know what I was going to do until one hand opened the door and the other gestured him in . What did he mean by a " potion . " Aphrodisiac ? He did n't have a vial with him , and he had never been one of Sky Eyes 's lovers . Had he talked to Rashi ? Without intending to , I found in his mind that he had . Perhaps the boys and men were ignorant of Seeing and Knowing , but they knew - or soon would - that the mute girl who lived with Sky Eyes shared her fondness for sex . Rashi had n't known my name either . The air thickened around me . I wanted to die . I wanted to go back three days and shut the door in Rashi 's face - or , at the very least , choke on the aphrodisiac as I poured it into my mouth . I turned away from Ketrin , again unwilling to show him tears . " Jamillah ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lover would . " Are you all right ? Should I go now ? " If I moved , I was afraid the tears would escape . At the back door , I sensed Sky Eyes , her arms full of darkberry stems . Her mind touched mine , took in the situation . She did n't come in . " Jamillah ? I did n't really need a potion . " He did n't want me to turn around any more than I wanted to . " I just wanted to talk to you . Perhaps we could go walking sometime . " Still I did n't move . " Ah , then , " he said . " Goodbye . " He opened the door . Before he could go out , before he could close it , I said , " Yes . " He hesitated . " Tomorrow , then . " Since I was n't looking at him , I could n't be sure , but it sounded as if he were smiling . Sky Eyes came in the back after he closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few wrinkled fruits fell off . " I was afraid your lover would n't leave before I was as wrinkled as these . " " Not my lover , " I hissed . Anger dried any thought of tears . " He will be , " she said . She spread a cloth on one end of the table and picked up a single stem , tapping its base firmly on the table so the dried darkberries would fall on the cloth . She tossed the stalks aside ; we used them to help start the fire . " He has beautiful hair . " My fingernails cut into my palms and she laughed . " I wo n't touch your precious Ketrin , unless he touches me first . " Something froze within me . I wanted to scream that he would never touch her , but my mind showed otherwise . A Knowing . His arms around her . His black curls tangled with her pale hair . His face reflected in winter  --  gray eyes . Her laughter died . " I 'm sorry , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , I wove a green ribbon into my hair and tied a yellow scarf around my waist . I will not let you take him , my mind said to Sky Eyes , when Ketrin smiled to see me . She just glared at me and turned away , thinking , as if I would . We went into the summer morning with a waterskin and a pouch of nuts and more dried diolla fruit than I should have taken  --  unlike darkberries , it was rare , hard to pick from steep mountain cuts , and it dried into practically nothing . Sky Eyes knew I had it , but she said nothing . It felt as if everyone watched us as we cut through the village , heading for the tallest hill this side of the mountains , almost a mountain in its own right . We had n't discussed where we were going , but it was n't hard to pick the destination out of Ketrin 's thoughts - a small cave with a curtain of vine over the mouth . He thought it was his alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been up there many times . If we were going very high in the mountains gathering , we sometimes slept in the cave to get us just that much closer . Or , late on a return trip , laden with full collecting bags , we stayed if we were too tired to make the final descent to the village . Ketrin was having a hard time deciding what to say , and I certainly did not help him . The steepness of the slope was a good excuse , and we did little but cast shy glances at each other as we climbed . I do n't know what would have happened had we drunk from the waterskin on the steep part , but our hands were too busy grasping rocks and sturdy rooted grasses to help in the ascent . It was n't until we reached the cave and collapsed side by side that Ketrin unslung the waterskin from his back and took a long pull before passing it to me . The expression on his face might have warned me , but I was so thirsty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tasted , how He reached for me as the first giddy waves of desire hit me . " Jamillah , " he said , as he laid me back into the cave , stroking my face , my throat , my breasts . My own hands were busy , running over his chest and down over his hips and the curve of his buttocks , pressing him against me . We did n't even undress . I unlaced the front of his trousers with frantic fingers and he lifted my skirt . " You are so beautiful , " he murmured into my hair , his breath warm in the hollow beneath my ear . " So beautiful . " His hands lower now . I moved under him , and then we were moving together . It was better than the time with Rashi , for there was no pain , and I knew what to expect . Too , there was something about Ketrin that had captivated me for these eight years , ever since I had seen him in that ring of silent children . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had satisfied ourselves , we lay together , my head on his chest , my face hidden in my own hair . The questions I read in his mind were echoed in my own : what had happened ? I had put plain , fresh water in the skin and-and then I had gone to fix the ribbon in my hair . Sky Eyes must have poured out some of the water and replaced it with aphrodisiac . It did n't take much , especially when attraction existed already . But he thought I had done it . " Sky Eyes , " I whispered . " Not me . " I tried to straighten my skirt , as it was bunched about my waist . It was n't a long skirt , anyway , but the shorter skirt to be worn with cloth or leather leggings , so useful when climbing or riding . Some women wore them always , but I had always enjoyed the feel of soft cloth swishing against my bare legs . Ketrin helped me straighten my skirt , and then rolled away from me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sudden , wild passion we had exhibited . Not all of it could be explained by the aphrodisiac , diluted as it was . I sat up and pushed my hair back , carefully not looking at him . The discarded waterskin lay on the ground near me , by some quirk tossed aside in such a fashion that the mouth of it leaned up against a rock . Only a little had spilled . We had drink , if we were willing to drink it . Turning just a little , I saw Ketrin also looking at the hide container , also coming to the same conclusions . He blushed and dipped his head . " Sit closer , " he said , patting the ground next to him . I scooted over and leaned against him , feeling suddenly trembly . " I 'm thirsty , " he said deliberately , reaching past me for the waterskin , his arm brushing my breast . " Are you ? " After a hot , anxious second , I nodded . The grin he gave me was not apologetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , holding the bag out as if in salute . " We might as well drink it all this time . " I opened my mouth and he gave me a long drink , took one himself . Back and forth , until the bag was empty and we were reeling with passion . This time we took our clothes off , explored every inch of sensitive skin . There was no more embarrassment , no more hesitation , only my brown body against his pale one . After two more times when we seemed to be trying to get inside each other 's skin , we dressed . There was no more aphrodisiac , no more water . We fed each other the nuts and the tiny amber globes of dried diolla fruit . " We had better go , " Ketrin said , glancing at the sun through the sparse curtain of vine . I nodded and stood , running my hands over my hair . " It 's no use , " said Ketrin . " You are well and truly mussed . Wild . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on then . " We were just as silent on the way down . I did n't let Ketrin come in with me , just pushed him gently into the lengthening shadows . I was starving and my throat was very dry . I did n't know whether to thank Sky Eyes or scream at her . In the end , I did neither . Sky Eyes was in her bed with someone ; I was n't sure who . I filled a clean skin with water and took it to my room , with a whole roast bird that she had left for me by the trickling stream in the cold box . My fingers were greasy and my stomach full when I crept out later to wash and pee . Sky Eyes was in bed still , alone now , not asleep . " Goodnight , " she called softly . " I hope you enjoyed it . " As usual , I said nothing . IF ONLY I could say that Ketrin and I were as happy as we had been that afternoon . If only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head - it had n't happened , but it would , and that poisoned me . Even when we were together in my bed , I was angry . At Sky Eyes ; at Ketrin ; at myself , for somehow letting it happen . I did n't tell him what was to happen , but every time he smiled at Sky Eyes , every time he spoke politely to her , I scowled . I stopped talking entirely , which made being with him more difficult . " Should we stay here today ? " he asked me quietly , standing on the step . I shook my head . He sighed . Insects , stickery plants , rocky ground - all those deterrents to bedding outside flew through his mind . " All right then , let 's go . " The image again , the two of them together , flew through mine . Ketrin lying back on Sky Eyes 's sheet as she bent over him . No , I did n't want to go out into the dust , either . I shook my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to stay ; you do n't want to go . I think you do n't even want to be with me . Fine , then . You do n't have to . " He turned and left , taking the steps in one angry movement . I was alone . I was alone . I was alone . The image . Over and over . I could n't leave or he would think I was following him . I could n't go in to face Sky Eyes . I walked down the steps and around the house to the back , where I picked the heads from tall feather grass with vicious snaps of my fingers . Sky Eyes came out a few minutes later . " Ketrin wants to see you . I 'll send him out . " She looked at the ground , littered with the decapitated feather grass . " When he 's gone , sort through those and preserve the ripe ones . Why could n't you have waited a week ? Over half of those are wasted now . " Ketrin was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , " he said , as soon as Sky Eyes left us alone . " I just do n't know what to do sometimes . " And you think I do ? I wanted to say . You think I understand myself - let alone you ? I just want to love you and have you love me and be able to forget about this picture in my head . I want to be just an ordinary girl . But I had never spoken so fluently in my life , and I could n't start now . I bent down and picked up a few ripe heads , rusty gold , lighter hull tips waving in the breeze . " Say something , " he said . " I know you can . " Everything I had ever wanted to say gathered at the back of my throat , a chokingball of unspoken words . The feather grass heads were light in my hands , tickling my palms . I picked up another . Tears dripped , but my back was to Ketrin , so he did n't see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Sorrow , anger , frustration - his voice was tight with all of them . If you 'd just talk to me beat in his mind . I sorted through the heads lying on the ground . To preserve them , one washed them thoroughly and packed them in clear , glass jars , then poured oil over them . After a year , they would be softened enough to eat , a delicacy . A pity I had broken them early - next year we would run short . The door closed behind Ketrin and he was gone . Sky Eyes left a few minutes later ; I heard her go , received her brief message in my mind , Gathering . I 'll be back tomorrow . There was nothing we needed desperately , but I was too upset to be more than dully grateful that she was giving me the time and space to grieve . Ta came in the night , found me sitting by the fire with salt tracks dried on my face . " Not the tears of a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firelight glinting off his smooth , perfect head . " You have gone and grown up on Ta ; have n't you , Jami-bird . " He ran dark thumbs down my cheeks , brought his hands up to his mouth and tasted . " Not child tears at all . " He did it again , a slow , deliberate stroke , and his moistened thumbs loosened the tautness of dry tears . I turned my face until one thumb brushed my lips . We both shivered . " Ta can help , " he said . " My brown one . My Jami-bird . " He kissed my mouth and my chin and my cheeks and my eyes . After a time , I was kissing him back . He tasted of strange spices . " You are not so sad now , " he said , pulling away . " Ta will let you sleep . " " No . " I caught hold of one of the loops of ribbon that decorated his vest . My voice was hoarse . " Sing . " " Ta sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , feeling shy . " Sing . " He looked at me for a long time , his eyelids hooding his eyes . " Come , then , little brown bird , my Jami-bird . " He led me to Sky Eyes 's bed , already humming under his breath , a deep droning that eased my hesitation about using her bed . " Lie down , Jami-bird , Wanissa shay . " He went back to his pack , took a handful of scent sticks from a hollow tube , and thrust the thick ends into the fire . Curls of scented smoke began to rise and drift . I was still standing by the bed . " Lie down , my slender one , my pretty one , my brown skin . " The words were a song to me . I let myself follow them as he placed the scent sticks in pitted lumps of clay that had been used for just this purpose . Windflower and siella and something that smelled of burning sandal oil , other scents too exotic for me to identify . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds that touched the ear without meaning . He knelt beside me on the bed . His hands were smaller than my own , and deft , but he did not hurry . He withdrew the laces of my dress , parted the bodice , touched my breasts as if they had never been touched . And they had n't - not the way he did it anyway . Rashi and Ketrin , my only other lovers , were boys . Ta was a man who knew women . Before he had removed my dress , his own vest and tunic and leggings , I was infused with pleasure . " You are a candy , " Ta sang , his mouth against my skin , his breath warming my woman hair . " You are sweetness . You are a fruit to be tasted . " It was a long time , hazy with scent and sensation , before he fitted his body to mine and brought us both to a gasping climax . He sang and whispered to me , and I found bits of song in my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our limbs twined together . " My hungry one , my filled one , my Jamillah . " My part was pieces of a rising and falling tune that was utterly unlike my usual harsh or whispered words . This , more than the exquisite pleasure , filled me with happiness . " Ta , " I said , after we had finished , letting it be part of a song . " Ta . " " My Jami-bird has found her voice , " he said . He gleamed darkly beside me . " My Jami-bird sings . " Sky Eyes was a Seer , an herbalist , a wise woman , but no singer . I knew no songs except those trapped inside me , only beginning to be freed . Ta sang a lullaby for me , simple in tune and meaning , and I listened and listened and finally sang along , sobbing . " Mother rocks her baby soft , Mother rocks her baby slow , Mother rocks her baby warm , and baby falls asleep . " Somewhere in the center of the singing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earliest part of morning , Ta was watching me . " So , " he said , " my Tami-bird , my night singer , do you still have song in you ? " At first , I thought he meant to share my bed again - or Sky Eyes 's bed rather - but he just wanted to hear me sing . I hummed shyly , hiding behind my hair , but the song was there ; I could feel it . " Mother rocks her baby soft .... " My voice was slight and uncertain , but clear . Ta 's smile was very white in his dark face . " Jamillah , my sweetness , you have - " An image hit me and I crumpled and cried out . Ketrin and Sky Eyes . Ta 's arms around me . Their forms against the curtain of vines . " What has happened ? Jamillah ? " Sky Eyes looking at me through the window of the Seeing , her eyes black , a sliver moon slicing through the blackness . " Jamillah ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . You ca n't do this , I cried silently . You did , she replied from the cave , her mind voice angry and hurt . Why should I not ? " Jamillah . Tell me what has happened . " The familiar muteness stilled me , but Ta would have none of it . " You can tell Ta , you can . Sing it to me , child . A bit at a time . " He held me and listened and stroked and coaxed . " I will not let you keep this silence . Tell me . " Somehow , I made the words come out , singing stubborn bits , stopping to catch my breath and weep . I told of Ketrin and killing my mother and Seeing and Knowing and loving Sky Eyes and hating her . Ta held me like a child , like a lover , like a friend . " You are all right , Jami-bird , all right . This is best , the telling . This is what you must do . " The best thing is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , wretched time when I was seven . I wept harder , shaking myself to the bone , shaking Ta , shaking the image of the lovers from my head . When I was wept out , Ta rubbed my back , sat me up , made me drink some tea . The scent sticks had burnt down to the clay hours before ; there was little residue of our sensuous night . Ta groaned and touched my face , which definitely held the residue of my weeping . " Here you are , sadder than when I came . " I laughed , dribbling tea on the sheets . " Not sadder . " " Perhaps not , " he said . He looked at me . " Jamillah , this Seeing and Knowing , can you use it at will ? Or does it just come when it comes ? " " Both , " I said . He nodded at me to explain , and , after a moment , halting over longer phrases , I did . " Sometimes , it comes . One can - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can you ? " I nodded . " Do you want to stay here ? " Ta asked , slowly and deliberately . " If you are happy - if you want to stay - I will say no more . " " Say it , " I whispered . " You could come with me , " he said . " As a peddler , I can not stay long in one place , but if you were there , Seeing and Knowing , brewing potions - we could stay a hand of days . Maybe even two hands . " I was silent . Not because I could not talk , but because I did not know what to say . I was only fifteen - not old enough to make that decision . But then , what about the decision I 'd had to make at seven ? Things must be decided when they come up , not when one is ready to decide . Sky Eyes had she hesitated to take me ? No . Had she regretted doing so ? Perhaps lately , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the things she let me learn for myself , the midnight bread we ate under the stars . Could I leave her ? Would I regret doing so ? " Yes , " I said , not sure which question I was answering . Of course I would regret it , but girls left their mothers all the time , to marry or take up a trade . In a way , this would be both , for I could read Ta 's desire , mingled with his business proposal . My eyes filled with tears again , and Ta gathered me close again . I laughed through my sniffles - after being so careful not to show tears to Ketrin .... " You will miss her , " he said , " and she you . But you will come back . It does n't take Seeing and Knowing to know that . " Sky Eyes face appeared in my mind again , and she too was crying from her night black eyes . " I 'm sorry , " I said , with my voice as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So very sorry . Ta patted my back , unaware of the exchange . " You must not be sorry . You feel what you feel . You are who you are . " I was barely aware of him . " I will come back , " I whispered . " You know I will . " " Of course you will come back , " Ta said . Come back , she said . Oh , come back , my daughter . Her image wavered and disappeared , as if our common tears had washed it away . I did n't take much in the way of glassware and tools ; Ta could trade for such things . Several bunches of dried bone leaf , wrapped in paper . I could powder it myself when we reached Shaboor , the next stop . Small amounts of other plants that I would not be able to collect as we traveled - plants that were available in the spring , those that grew only in this area . The blankets from my bed . My few dresses and leggings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dragged on the floor for two years now . In the summer heat , I put it on and buried my face in the wool of the collar , savoring the warm smell . Sky Eyes had given me back my mother through the touch of her death . But she had given me so much more as well . I slung the cloak over my arm and took the shennikan feather from its place on the wall . Not that Ta would be unable to please me , but that I could still please myself . Thank you , Sky Eyes . I unhooked the yellow cloth , still bright , with the lizards scampering across it . This I would take as well , a piece of my home , a part of my life . I folded it neatly and placed it on top of the cloak in the smallest of Ta 's packs , the one he had cleared for my use by redistributing items in other packs . Before I strapped the top down , I stroked the fabric and sent a silent message . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , from his place near the pack beast 's head . " Are you sure ? " I nodded , secured the strap . This was a hard thing , but a good thing , perhaps the best thing . " Then we 're away , " he said . The rhythm of our steps as we set out brought a new song to the back of my throat .
