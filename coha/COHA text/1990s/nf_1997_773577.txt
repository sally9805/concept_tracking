txt // the shapes of objects , it can be difficult to see the shapes of objects in them , and we often speak of reading engineering drawings . Attempts are often made to improve engineering drawings as representations , and this can be achieved in two ways . One is to use one of the parallel oblique systems such as oblique projection or isometric projection instead of orthogonal projection . Oblique projections show the front faces of objects as true shapes , and in cavalier oblique projection the side edges are shown as true ( scale ) lengths . In isometric projection ( figs. 2.16 and 2.17 ) , all the edges are shown as true ( scale ) lengths , although none of the faces is shown as a true shape . Another approach , popular in the nineteenth century but less often used today , is to add tonal modeling and/or shadows ( fig. 6.3 ) . Figs. 9.1e and f are both representations of the object in vertical oblique projection . In fig. 9.1e the angle between the projection rays and the picture plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top faces are shown foreshortened . Fig. 9.1e is more effective as a representation than the drawing in orthogonal projection shown at fig. 9.1 d , but the drawing still appears relatively flat , and it requires something of an effort of will to impose a three-dimensional interpretation . In fig. 9.1f the angle between the projection rays and the picture plane is 45 ? , and all the faces are shown as true shapes . As a result , a false attachment has been introduced in the center of the drawing , and this has the effect of flattening the image and reducing the effectiveness of the drawing as a representation . Fig. 9.1g shows the object in orthogonal projection but in a foreshortened position , so that both the top and side faces are foreshortened . Drawing g perhaps looks slightly more natural than drawing e , which is in vertical oblique projection , but it could be argued that because drawing e shows the front face of the object as a true shape , it actually corresponds more closely than drawing g to the appearance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 9.1h is in isometric projection , and like drawing f contains a false attachment , which tends to reduce the picture to a flat pattern . In addition , the drawing is symmetrical , and this also tends to reduce its effectiveness as a representation . Fig. 9.1i is difficult to interpret because lines representing all the edges of the object , including hidden edges , have been included in the drawing . Like a Necker cube drawing , in which all the edges of a cube are represented , this drawing is reversible , although alternative interpretations are more difficult to impose than they are with the Necker cube ( try to imagine the front tat c as a large square ) . // Fig. 9.1 j is similar to fig. 9.1a but is in inverted perspective rather than oblique projection . Like fig. 9.1a , it gives a strong impression of threedimensional shape , but a distorted shape rather than the shape it is intended to represent . Finally , fig. 9.1k is neither effective nor acceptable as a shape representation . It does not show a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and line junctions do not obey the rules for line drawings described in Chapter 5 . Our intuitions about these drawings seem to be very strong , and we can deduce from them a number of constraints with which a line drawing of an object having plane faces must comply if it is to provide an effective shape representation : A1 . The drawing should show a possible view ( failure to meet this constraint eliminates drawings j and k ) . A2 . This view must not be taken from too oblique an angle ( eliminates drawing c ) . A3 . The view must be taken from a general position , in order to avoid false attachments arising from accidental alignments in the scene ( eliminates drawings d , e , f , g , and h ) . A4 . The drawing should show only those faces , edges , and corners that can be seen from a single viewpoint ( eliminates drawing i ) . AS . The drawing should contain , if possible , at least one T-junction ( eliminates drawing b , which is ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal scene perception . The geometry of drawings in any of the projection systems described in Chapter 2 ( with the exception of naive perspective and inverted perspective ) will correspond to the geometry of projections of real objects in the frontal plane , provided the angle of projection is not too oblique : normally we direct our eyes toward objects , rather than viewing them obliquely . In addition , the visual system seems to work on the assumption that we view things from a general direction of view so that accidental alignments are avoided . If there is a straight line in the image , the visual system infers that the edge producing that image is also straight , and ignores the possibility that the property " being straight " in the image might be the result of a highly unlikely alignment between the direction of view and the plane of curvature of a curved edge . Finally , the presence of T - junctions which show one teatime behind ; mother provides a highly effective substi212 FUNCTIONS OF REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS tute in pictures for the absence of other sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Line Drawings of Smooth Objects Somewhat similar constraints apply to line drawings of smooth objects if they are to be effective as representations , but there are important differences of detail . Richards , Koenderink , and Hoffman ( 1987 ) examined these constraints in relation to outline drawings of smooth objects and began by examining three simple outline drawings . Two of these were similar to those shown in fig. 9.2 , which they called the " ellipse " ( drawing a ) and the " peanut " ( drawing b ) . The third drawing , which is not shown here , they called the " dumbbell . " The simplest of these outlines is the ellipse which , as Richards et al . say , we " naturally " interpret as the silhouette of an ellipsoid or egg . Alternatively , this drawing could represent the outline of a peanut viewed from above , but in this view the concave part of the outline representing the saddle-shaped surface forming the lower part of the peanut would not be visible . As a result , we would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peanut , and Richards et al . proposed that this is because we normally assume that all the undulations necessary to infer a plausible three-dimensional shape from a picture are visible in the silhouette . This , as they point out , is an extension of the " general position " restriction , defined by Huffman ( 1971 ) , which requires that the view of an object is not a special one . Richards et al . thus defined what they called a " canonical " ( p. 1169 ) ( or " prototypic , " p. 1170 ) view of a smooth object as one whose silhouette reveals all the undulations in its surface . A slight change in the viewpoint , for such a view , should not suddenly reveal any new " bumps " or " dents " ' ( p. 1169 ) in the surface that were previously hidden by occlusion. // Special views may not just be misleading as to surface undulations , however . Fig. 9.2c shows the end view of the peanut , and this view is not only misleading because it disguises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peanut , suggesting that its volumetric shape is round rather than long . A top view , in contrast , similar to the view shown in fig. 9.2a , would disguise the surface undulations but correctly represent the extendedness of the peanut . Thus , if a line drawing of a smooth object is to be effective as a representation , it should not only show a canonical view which reveals all the surface undulations , but must also show a representative view : that is , a view that reflects the extendedness of the viewed object ( Willats , 1992a , p. 488 ) . As with rectangular shapes , the presence of one or more T - junctions in a drawing of a smooth object very much enhances its effectiveness as a representation . End junctions are also valuable because they show that the drawing is intended to represent a smooth object ( Koenderink , 1990 ) . Thus drawing d is more effective as a representation of a peanut than drawing b , which might equally well represent the edges of a flat cutout or a closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid object , and provides about as effective a representation as drawing d . Although the extendedness of its silhouette does not reveal the extendedness of the peanut , the concavity of the line close to the end junction gives a vivid impression of the threedimensional ( saddle-shaped ) surface at this point , so that we can recognize drawing e as a partially foreshortened view of the peanut . Fig. 9.2f is perhaps rather less effective as a representation of a peanut , however . Not only does the extendedness of its silhouette disguise the extendedness of the peanut , but the lines representing contours almost merge at the T-junction , rather than intersecting at right angles . The representation would become even less effective if the peanut were to be turned a little further . Koenderink ( 1990 ) says : " Tangencies of contours and curves should only occur if they indicate an actual tangency of the spatial configuration . This holds equally true for ' I ' junctions . You must substitute ? almost ? orthogonality for mere transversality because otherwise it is quite likely that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , as with rectangular objects , it is possible to infer a number of constraints on line drawings of smooth objects if they are to be effective as shape representations : 111 . The drawing must show .1 possible view ( same as A 1 above ) . 11 2 . This view should normally he representatitve ( that is , it should reflect the extendedness of the viewed object ) . This constraint // eliminates drawings c and f . However , it may sometimes be possible to override this constraint by showing a view including T- and end junctions , so that the object can be shown in a foreshortened position , as in drawing e . B3 . The view shown must be canonical ( that is , it should reveal all the surface undulations ) . This eliminates drawing a . B4 . The drawing should , if possible , contain T- and end junctions ( similar to A5 ) . Silhouettes Fig. 9.3 shows silhouettes corresponding to some of the drawings in figs. 9.1 and 9.2 , and it is intuitively obvious that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to that given by most line drawings . In addition , the effectiveness of a silhouette as a shape representation depends in the case of rectangular objects on the sharpness of the outline . In figs. 9.2e to h and 1 to n , the outlines of the silhouettes have been artificially blurred to simulate the appearance of these shapes as they would appear when seen from a considerable distance or in conditions of poor visibility . In the case of drawings e to h , these blurred silhouettes are much less effective as representations of rectangular objects than the silhouettes with sharp outlines . In the case of drawings 1 to n , however , the effectiveness of the blurred silhouettes as representations is not much less than it would be in the case of the silhouettes with sharp outlines . The " general position " restriction , which was originally intended to apply to line drawings of objects having plane faces , also seems to hold true for silhouettes of objects having plane faces . Koenderink ( 1984 ) illustrates a figure taken from a book on drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangular figures such as the cube , the pyramid , and the cylinder ( a " mixed " figure which contains both plane and smooth faces ) , the strongest spatial impression is given by generic ( that is , general ) views . Figs. 9.3a to d show silhouettes of the cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner , the object shown in line in fig. 9.1a , and it is obvious that the silhouettes shown in figs. 9.3a and b , which show general views , are better as representations than the silhouette shown at d which shows a special ( front ) view . In addition , fig. 9.3a is more effective as a representation than fig. 9.3b : not , as in the corresponding drawing shown in fig. 9 . I a , because fig. 9.3a contains a T-junction , but because the concavity in the outline of this figure reveals the concavity in the volumetric shape of the object , which fig. 9.3h does not . Thus the restriction previously suggested for smooth objects by Richards et // al . ( 1987 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface undulations ( that is , that it should be canonical ) , seems also to hold good for silhouettes of rectangular objects . It also seems to hold good for the outlines of line drawings of rectangular objects , like the line drawing shown in fig. 9. la , and for the outlines of line drawings combined with silhouettes , like Greek black-figure and red-figure vase paintings . This restriction thus appears to be a particularly important one . Another restriction which also holds good for silhouettes is that the picture should not show a projection that is too oblique . Fig. 9.3c is clearly misleading as a representation , although it shows a possible projection from a general position . Perkins ( 1972 ) discusses this restriction in line drawings of similar figures in terns of the relations between the angles between lines // representing internal edges . In silhouettes these lines are not , of course , present ; nevertheless , fig. 9.3c is still not acceptable as a representation . Presumably this is because the extendedness of the silhouette does not reflect the extendedness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction also seems to apply to line drawings , and line drawings combined with silhouettes ; and again this restriction is a particularly important one . Fig. 9.3i shows an end view of the peanut shown in fig. 9.2 and is not effective as a representation because it represents neither the extendedness nor the surface undulations of the viewed object . Fig. 9.3j shows a silhouette of a profile view of the peanut and , like the outline drawing shown in fig. 9.2b , provides a reasonably good representation . The silhouette shown in fig. 9.3k corresponds to the outline of the line drawing shown in fig. 9.2d , but whereas fig. 9.2d is more effective as a representation than the outline drawing shown in fig. 9.2b because it contains both T- and end junctions , the silhouette corresponding to this slightly foreshortened view is rather less effective as a representation than the silhouette shown in fig. 9.3j . This is because fig. 9.3k contains a cusp that is , an L-shaped discontinuity in the outline which gives the misleading impression that the silhouette represents a smooth surface with a crease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouettes of smooth objects , if they are to be effective as representations , appear to be different from those that apply to line drawings : silhouettes of smooth objects are not more effective as representations if they show such objects in general positions . As a result , it is usually difficult or impossible to use silhouettes to show smooth objects in foreshortened positions : a constraint that has important implications for the patterns of development exhibited in both children 's drawings ( Chapter 13 ) and Greek vase painting ( Chapter 14 ) . Where the outlines of a silhouette of a rectangular object are sharply defined , the details of the outline are usually crucially important , because the outlines can show the shapes of features like edges and corners . Where the outlines are blurred , it is only the shapes of the regions that are informative , and these regions can show only the simplest and most basic three-dimensional shape features such as extendedness , together with some secondary shape properties such as " having a dent . " Fig. 9.3e represents the cube with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dent in it : the property " having flat faces " has virtually disappeared . Figs. f and h merely represent the object as a lump , and the " general position " restriction has become largely irrelevant . Fig. 9.3g totally misrepresents the object bemuse it ills represents its extendedness . Similarly , fig. 9.31 misrepresents the extendedness of the peanut.Figs. 9.3m and n both represent the peanut reasonably // effectively , as a long bent volume ; because the outline is blurred , the presence or absence of a cusp in the contour becomes irrelevant . It is thus possible to infer the constraints on silhouettes of objects of this kind if they are to be effective as representations : Cl . The silhouette should show a representative view ( it should reflect the extendedness of the viewed object ) . C2 . The silhouette should show a canonical view ( it should reveal all the surface undulations ) . By comparing line drawings with silhouettes , it is possible to draw some general conclusions from these pictures . To begin with , it seems immediately obvious that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the drawings shown in figs. 9.1a and 9.2d provide us with far more vivid impressions of three-dimensional shape than the corresponding drawings shown in figs. 9.3a and 9.3k . Second , it seems hardly possible to produce silhouettes showing impossible objects , like the drawing of an impossible object shown in fig. 9.1k . Any silhouette , of whatever shape , can be interpreted as a picture of a possible object . Third , foreshortening can not be shown effectively in silhouettes of smooth objects . Whereas the line drawings shown in figs. 9.2d and 9.2e provide effective representations of peanuts in foreshortened positions , fig. 9.3k does not . Notice that this is a consequence of using different denotation systems ; it hardly matters whether we think of these drawings as being in orthogonal projection or perspective . Finally , there are differences in the effectiveness of silhouettes as representations of smooth objects , and objects having plane faces . First , the most effective representation in silhouette of the cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner is fig. 9.3a , which shows a three-quarter view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.3j , which shows a profile view . Second , blurring the outline makes a very considerable difference to the silhouettes of objects having plane faces , but little difference to the silhouettes of smooth objects . Compare , for example , figs. 9.3b and f , and figs. 9.3j and m . The examples given in figs. 9.1 , 9.2 , and 9.3 depict objects with relatively simple shapes . It seems likely , however , that the constraints that they suggest can be generalized to more complex objects , and if this is so , these constraints have important consequences for artists and draftsmen . This is especially important in the case of- objects with complex smooth surfaces such as the human figure . For example , the head of the figure shown iii silhouette in Lady Taking Tea ( fig. 5.1 ) is shown in profile , and this view , like the profile view of the peanut shown in fig. ' 9.3j provides the best possible // representation of a head in silhouette because it shows the maximum number of surface undulations without cusps . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fig. 1.6 , the drawings of the wrestlers shown in fig. 5.9 , and the red-figure painting of Phoenix and Achilles shown in fig. 14.8 , the heads are shown in three-quarter views . In line drawings , three-quarter views of this kind often provide the most effective representations because they maximize the number of informative T- and end-junctions in the drawing . In silhouettes , however , such views would be ineffective . Fig. 14.8 provides an example of silhouette combined with line drawing , and the element of silhouette in this painting detracts from the effectiveness of the line drawing , so that the representation of shape seems rather weak and would seem weaker still if the vase were to be viewed from a considerable distance . I have suggested that a picture provides an effective shape representation if it is possible to see in the picture , clearly and unambiguously , the three-dimensional shape of the object that the artist or draftsman intended to depict . If the shape of the object can be seen in the picture , then the object can be recognized . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as representations than silhouettes . Under exceptional viewing conditions , such as when a picture is seen from far away , or in mist or driving rain , or under poor lighting conditions such as the interior of a dimly lit church , silhouettes may be more effective as representations : hence the use of silhouettes in banners , road signs , and icon paintings . Pictures based on optical denotation systems may provide more effective representations than silhouettes , but this will depend very much on the way the subject is lit and the size of the marks in relation to the subject . The detail of a newspaper photograph shown in fig. 1.8 , for example , provides only a rather poor representation of a figure : the representation of shape in this photograph is little better than in the rock engravings of gladiators in combat shown in fig. 1.5 or the Greek vase painting of the geometric period shown in fig. 14.1 . Line drawings with shadows may sometimes be better as representations than plain line drawings : as Waltz ( 1975 ) has shown , the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modeling and/or surface contours may be helpful in showing surface undulations itt drawings of smooth objects ? like the figures of women shown iii Raphael 's Study of the ' Ogee Gnu-es ( fig. 62 )  --  in cases where these undulations would not be revealed by the outline alone . // Thus I shall argue in this part of the book that particular representational systems are best suited to serve particular functions . In this respect , pictorial representation appears to be very different from natural language . All natural languages seem to be about equally good for the same things , and any thought can be expressed with almost equal ease in any language . Contrary to popular belief , it does not appear to be true that some languages are better than others for discussing certain topics : that the Inuit ( Eskimo ) languages have hundreds of words for snow , for example , while English has only one or two . ' Finally , the constraints on pictures if they are to provide effective shape representations are all constraints imposed by the design features of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints are conventional . In this respect also , pictures are very different from natural languages . ; HAPTER TEN Flattening the Picture Surface . s a number of writers have pointed out , pictures provide us with a view of a apparently real world but are at the same time merely blobs or dots of ai nt or pigment . Gibson ( 1978 ) refers to this property as duality : " a picture both a surface in its own right , and a display of information about something else " ( p. 231 ) . But it is not merely a display of information , like a st of words or numbers . As Wollheim says , a representation is a configuraon in which something or other can be seen , and this " seeing in " is central our experience of pictures . In the language of artificial intelligence , pictures represent scenes . Scenes : e three-dimensional and are made up of scene primitives such as corners , ages , and surfaces . Pictures , on the other hand , are two-dimensional and arc lade up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junctions . These : e the two domains with which we are mainly concerned in the analysis of ictures . In addition , it is necessary to distinguish between marks and picture primitives : actual drawings and paintings are made up of physical marks such lines of ink or areas of paint , and in real pictures marks of this kind present the picture primitives . Moreover , the depicted world is made up of objects , like people and chairs , and the scene primitives represent the abstract shape attributes of such objects . It is only in exceptional circumstances that we have the experience of being any of these domains in isolation when we look at a picture . At one extreme we may , when we look at a picture , have a mistaken belief that we -e looking at a real scene . As I pointeed out iii the previous chapter , we may : wally believe when looking at a tromp. 1'oeil painting that What we , ire . ring is a collection of old letters , ribbons , and other objects stock on a // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Corridor , we may believe that we are looking down a real corridor . This experience may not necessarily be accompanied by any very strong sensation of depth , although it sometimes may be : what we think we see is the object domain . In contrast , the impression of depth and three-dimensional shape given by some special kinds of pictures such as stereograms may be almost as strong as that obtained from a real scene , but this experience is not necessarily accompanied by an erroneous belief that we are looking at real objects . When we look at an Impressionist painting , on the other hand , we may , if we are sufficiently close , see nothing but marks : blobs of paint on a flat surface . These are exceptional cases , however . Most paintings and drawings do not provide complete illusions because , although we may see objects in them , we do not experience them as fully real . Nor do we experience the same sensation of depth and three-dimensional shape in the painting as we would in a real scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor do we normally experience a painting simply as a configuration of picture primitives , or marks on a surface . To a greater or lesser extent , we may be aware of some or all of these domains , and the strength with which they impress themselves on our awareness may vary greatly from one picture to another . Looking at Picasso 's drawing of Stravinsky ( fig. 1.6 ) , we will probably not be very aware of the pencil lines as marks on the surface , unless we choose to pay special attention to them , but we probably will be aware of the lines in the drawing as configurations of picture primitives . Looking at a Pointillist painting or an Impressionist painting , especially at close hand , we will probably be more aware of the marks on the surface ; whereas looking at Vermeer 's The Music Lesson ( fig. 2.19 ) , we may be more aware of the objects in the depicted scene . Thus , although Gibson speaks of the " duality " of pictures , up to four domains may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate pictorial devices , the artist can tilt the balance of our awareness of these different domains one way or the other . In the twentieth century , many painters have tilted the balance away from illusion toward an awareness of the picture surface : that is , toward " flatness . " In the first part of this chapter I shall describe the various pictorial devices that an artist might use in order to tilt the balance toward flatness , and in the second part I shall try to say something about the reasons why artists in different periods . and cultures might want to tilt the balance in this direction . // Techniques for Flattening the Picture Based on the Mark Systems Obtrusive Marks The surfaces of pictures intended to provide an illusion are invariably smooth , and the marks blend into each other imperceptibly : " like a puff of smoke , " as Cennino Cennini said . The eye is not tempted to linger on the surface of the picture , but looks through it to the depicted scene . If , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture surface . This is the case with mosaics , tapestries , and many Impressionist and Cubist paintings . In Roman mosaic pavements the spaces between the marble tesserae are filled in with mortar so that the surface is relatively smooth , but in Byzantine wall mosaics the interstices are left empty so that the tesserae are strongly present as individual units , and the surface as a whole appears rough and irregular . Moreover , the surfaces on which these mosaics are set are not completely flat . Both these factors draw attention to the picture as a physical surface . Very much the same factors operate in the case of tapestries . Many Impressionist paintings have rough-textured surfaces , and the Cubists sometimes added sand to their paint to make a rough texture . The Size of the Marks In normal book or newspaper photographs the dots of pigment are too small to be resolved as separate units . If these illustrations are enlarged , however , like the newspaper photograph of a hijacker shown in fig. 1.8 , the dots become too large to fuse on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Lichtenstein exploited this effect in his paintings : the mark system is an enlarged version of that used in printing cheap comics ( fig. 7.7 ) . A similar effect can be observed in Pointillist paintings such as those of Seurat ( color plate 2 ) , and large-scale marks that force themselves on the viewer 's attention are also found in most Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings : they are particularly noticeable in Van Gogh 's paintings and drawings , for example ( fig. 7.1 ) . In Matisse 's Neo-Impressionist paintings the individual marks are huge in relation to the overall size of the canvas . Uniformity of Texture ( ; ikon ( 19510 suggested that surface texture , such as the texture provided by pebbles on a beach can provide important information about the shape and // orientation of surfaces . It is not essential that all the pebbles should be the same size , but merely that the texture should be composed of elements that are more or less uniformly distributed . If the textured surface lies at an angle to the viewer , the units of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Texture gradients , as they are called ( that is , the change in the size of the units of texture with distance ) , are simply a form of linear perspective , and like linear perspective provide a cue to distance ( Marr , 1982 ) . Conversely , a uniformly distributed pattern of marks on the surface of a picture ( whether or not they are all the same size or shape ) will tend to emphasize the flatness of the picture : because there is no texture gradient in the pattern of these marks , we read the picture as a flat , vertical surface . The flattening effect of a uniformly distributed pattern of marks can be seen very clearly when fig. 6.1a is compared with fig. 6. l b . In the photograph shown in fig. 6.1a the grain of the film , though perceptible , is not very obtrusive , and consequently the foreshortening of the house relative to the plane of the picture can be seen quite clearly . In contrast , the image shown in fig. 6. l b appears completely flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the directions of the brushstrokes followed the directions of the principal curvatures of the surfaces of the depicted forms . These brushstrokes acted as surface contours and enhanced the representation of three-dimensional shape produced by the tonal modeling . During the latter half of the 1870s , however , the brushwork became more independent of the depicted form and took on a different role : " The size of brushstroke was kept relatively uniform over the entire canvas , and so it no longer aided an illusion of recession , but emphasized the physical surface of the picture . Thus , the artist forced the spectator to remember that the picture confronted was a painting , which had its own reality , and was not simply an extension of the spectator 's world " ( Anfam et al. , 1987 , p. 213 ) . This device is very evident in Cezanne 's later paintings . Facture facture is the term used by art historians to describe the manner in which a painting has been executed , especially as it testifies to the work of human hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately evident , but in other cases we may be made aware of the physical reality of the picture because of this element of facture . In the Chinese painting by Chu Ta shown in fig . I0.9 , for example , the ink has obviously been brushed , blobbed , and flooded on the surface of the paper under the operation of l4 FUNCTIONS OF REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS Human control . In tronipe 1'oeil and ultrarealistic paintings , in contrast , traces the operations of the human hand are , as far as possible , suppressed : ) thing must interfere with the illusion provided by the pictorial image . structure is , however , a tricky business , and the effort involved in eliminating e element of facture can itself draw attention to the physicality of the cture : Between 1908 and 1910 I made my first attempts to transcend inherited art forms , inherited prejudices .... All accident was excluded . No spots , tears , fibres , imprecisions , should disturb the clarity of our work . For our paper pictures we even discarded the scissors with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily betrayed the art of the hand . From this tune on we used a paper cutting machine . ( Arp , 1948 , p. 76 ) In spite of all this effort , and perhaps because of it , the paintings and collages this period are readily identifiable as the work of a particular person at a trticular time , and this in itself seems to draw attention to their physical reality . These pictorial devices may all be present together , or they may be used parately or combined in various ways . In the mosaics at Ravenna Fig. 14.10 ) , the marks ( the tesserae ) are strongly physical , roughly uniform size , and more or less uniformly distributed across the picture surface ; but ere is little or no element of facture . In Chinese painting there is often a rong element of facture , but the surface is usually relatively smooth , and the arks may be varied in both shape and distribution . Techniques for Flattening the Picture ased on the Drawing Systems The Geometry of the Different Drawing Systems One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In e perception of real scenes the image of an object projected onto the tina will be smaller as the object is further away , and the representation of is effect in pictures gives a strong impression of depth . If this cue is not esent , the picture will appear relatively flat , so , although Hagen ( 1986 ) has gued that systems like orthogonal projection and oblique projection may regarded as versions of what she called " natural perspective , ' ? pictures in ese systems do not provide the same depth cues . I showed in Chapter 9 that it a picture is to provide a good representation three-dimensional shape , it should show rectangular objects from a general position . In practice this means using either perspective or one of ' // the parallel oblique systems such as oblique projection or isometric projection or their variants . Conversely , pictures in orthogonal projection or horizontal or vertical oblique projection provide only poor representations , and pictures based on these systems look relatively flat . In addition , false attachments in the picture ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three-dimensional shape . Pictures in orthogonal projection and horizontal or vertical oblique projection thus look relatively flat compared with pictures in oblique projection or perspective , partly because they do not contain the depth cues provided by linear perspective and partly because they do not show rectangular objects from a general direction of view , and are therefore more likely to contain false attachments representing accidental alignments within the scene . However , an additional factor seems to be involved . In pictures in horizontal or vertical oblique projection , all the edges of rectangular objects are represented by horizontal or vertical lines , and the grid which this sets up on the picture surface will be aligned with the edges of the picture itself , or with the picture frame . That is , all three axes of the coordinate system of the pictorial image will be aligned with the axes of the coordinate system of the picture . In real life this would be very unlikely to happen : if we were looking at a real scene through a window , it would be very unlikely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension would coincide with the horizontal and vertical edges of the window frame . This coincidence can be regarded as a special case of false attachment ; and this tends to draw attention to the picture as a flat surface . For example , Bonnard 's Nude in a Bathtub ( fig. 10.1 ) , in which the projected edges of the bath mat and the bathtub in the third dimension are both ( nearly ) aligned with the vertical axis of the picture surface , looks relatively flat . Similarly , in Cezanne 's Still Life with a Commode ( fig. 2.7 ) , the horizontal edges of the side of the commode are aligned with the horizontal axes of the picture surface , and again this tends to flatten the picture . Pictures in oblique projection show objects from a general direction of view , and thus normally give a relatively strong impression of three-dimensional shape . There is , however , no perspective cue to depth . Moreover , the orthogonals are parallel and run obliquely across the picture surface , so that in pictures like Lady Wenji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthogonals form . t regular grid which sits comfortably with the geometry of the picture . This tends to pull the third axis oldie perceived scene hack to the picture surface . I he same argument applies , though with somewhat less force , to pictures in isometric projection or.axonometric projection . For example , the dominant geometry of the picture in Gris 's Breakfast ( color plate 6 ) is that of axonoFlattening // metric projection , so that the perceived scene looks flatter than it would be if the picture had been in perspective . In Gris 's painting , however , many other pictorial devices are used to flatten the image still further . In pictures in perspective the correspondence between the directions of the projected edges in the picture and the principal axes of the picture itself is broken , and the orthogonals running toward a central vanishing point tend to " punch a hole in the canvas . " This is most obviously true in pictures in three-point perspective in which none of the projected edges is represented by a horizontal or vertical line . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the vertical axis of the image is represented as vertical ; but as we normally experience vertical edges in the scene as vertical , the coincidence between the vertical axes of the image and the picture is not experienced as a coincidence . Presumably a similar factor operates with pictures in single-point perspective : we are so used to seeing paintings , and even photographs , in which objects are shown frontally ( Costall , 1993 ) that we do not experience this as a coincidence and hence as a special case of false attachment . In pictures in inverted perspective the diminution of size with distance represented in pictures in normal perspective is reversed , and this destroys the illusion of depth . In Rublev 's The Holy Trinity ( color plate 1 ) and in the manuscript illustrations shown in figs. 2.24 and 2.25 , the diverging orthogonals flatten the depicted scene back onto the picture surface . However , insofar as it is possible to speak of a direction of view in connection with pictures in inverted perspective , this system , like linear perspective and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , a step to one side would not change the topology of the table on which the saint is sitting in fig. 2.25 , or the altar at which Abraham is sacrificing Isaac in fig. 14.9 . As a result , pictures in inverted perspective , unlike pictures in horizontal or vertical oblique projection , give a strong local impression of three-dimensional shape . There is thus a conflict in pictures in this system between the impression of depth provided locally by the shapes of the objects and the denial of depth overall provided by the divergence of the orthogonals . Moreover , the spatial systems in pictures in inverted perspective are rarely , if ever , coherent : although the orthogonals of the chairs and footstools in Rublev 's Trinity diverge , they do not diverge from what would he , in linear perspective , a single vanishing point ; and the building in the background is represented to a much smaller scale . Finally , because the orthogonals in pictures of this kind run in a variety of directions , they do not form a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 11470 Return to China . As a result , pictures in inverted perspective do not // simply look flat , but have a restless , dynamic quality : the conflict between the three-dimensional qualities of the perceived scene and the picture as a flat surface is left unresolved . Mixed Drawing Systems One of the most characteristic features of Persian miniature painting is the use of mixtures of drawing systems . In Laila and Majnum at School ( fig.10.2 ) , the fountain at the bottom left and the little hexagonal building to the right of the raised terrace are both in vertical oblique projection ; but the terrace itself , the steps up to the terrace , and the main building at the top of the painting are all in oblique projection . Moreover , the directions of the orthogonals in the terrace and the main building are not consistent with each other . The orthogonals of the main building slope , impossibly , downwards to the right , while the orthogonals of the terrace slope upwards to the right . Thus , although individual parts of the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the space of the scene as a whole , and this destroys the illusion of a real three-dimensional scene and flattens the picture . Cutting-Off In Bonnard 's Nude in a Bathtub ( fig. 10.1 ) , parts of the figure on the left and the nude figure in the bathtub are cut off by the frame of the painting . Scharf ( 1979 ) refers to this compositional device , in which figures or objects in the foreground are truncated by the frame , as " cutting-off " This device is fairly common in Impressionist painting . Degas in particular makes considerable use of it , and he seems to have been influenced in his use of this device by its presence in both Japanese woodblock prints and photography . In the photographic views published in large numbers from about 18611 onwards , such peculiarities frequently occur , and Degas would certainly have been aware of them . In addition , according to Scharf , " the association between Degas 's compositions and those of Japanese artists was made at least as early as 1880 when Huysmans described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame , as in some Japanese prints " ' ( I ' ) 79 ) , p. 1% ) . Scharf points out that the use of this technique appears in a particularly exaggerated form in Hiroshige 's prints of ( hrr l Hundred Views of Yedo ( fig. 10,3 ) and suggests that iii thew later prints Hiroshige may also have been influenced by photography . // One might have thought that a technique so closely associated with photography would have enhanced the illusionistic qualities of a picture , but this does not seem to be the case . The images in pictures are inherently flat because motion parallax can not occur within them : object boundaries do not move relative to each other in response to a movement to one side on the part of the spectator , nor do the boundaries of depicted objects change their positions relative to the frame . This effect is not so noticeable when objects are set back in the picture and wholly in view within the frame , as they are , for example , in Hoogstraeten 's trompe l'oeil wall painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object in the real world is set close to a window frame and cut off by it , the slightest movement on the part of the spectator changes the visible boundaries of the object . The fact that this does not happen in a picture when the boundaries of depicted objects are partially cut off by the picture frame emphasizes the flatness of the picture . The Effects of False Attachment A false attachment in a painting or drawing represents an accidental alignment between two or more parts of a scene and the position of the viewer . Because a false attachment in a picture does not disappear with the movement of the viewer , as it would in a view of a real scene , instances of false attachment tend to draw attention to the flatness of the picture surface . Paul Klee 's Town with Watchtowers ( fig. 1.16 ) contains numerous instances of false attachments between the lines representing the edges and corners of the buildings , and this tends to flatten the drawing into a pattern on the picture surface . Rather surprisingly , perhaps , Monet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false attachments in his paintings . In his Rocks at Port Coton , with the Lion Rock , 1886 ( fig. 10.4 ) , the use of false attachment is very obvious : the top of the cliff is falsely attached to the horizon . The flattening effect of the false attachment is , however , contradicted by the pattern of the brush marks : the marks at the bottom of the picture are larger and rougher than those at the top , giving an effect of depth . Symmetry The use of symmetry as a device to flatten the image is fairly rare . Monet 's painting of " ! he Seine at Giverny , Morning Mist ( fig. 10.5 ) is , however , almost completely symmetrical about a central horizontal axis , and a number of his paintings of the Waterlily Pond ( Japanese Bridge are nearly symmetrical about a central vertical axis . The use of symmetry in these pictures can be thought of as yet another special case of false attachment : in this case , a false attachment between the axis of symmetry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Avoidance of Atmospheric Perspective In real scenes the tonal differences between objects are reduced with distance , colors become cooler ( that is , they tend toward the blue end of the spectrum ) , colors become less saturated , and the contours of objects become less sharp . All or any of these effects may be represented in pictures and are referred to under the general heading of atmospheric perspective . To the extent that these factors are present in pictures , they operate as depth cues . In the false mezzotint Pastoral Scene shown in fig. 6.8 , for example , the contrasts between the darkest and lightest tones are in the immediate foreground of the picture , and the lines representing the contours of objects are lighter in tone and less distinct toward the background of the scene . Pictures in which these factors are not present generally appear relatively flat : in Orthodox icon paintings and many early Italian paintings , for example , objects in the background are painted just as distinctly as objects in the foreground , the hills in the distance are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of tonal contrast with distance . Atmospheric perspective was employed in Chinese painting from an early date . Cahill ( 1985 ) says of A Buddhist Temple in the Mountains , attributed to Li Ch'eng ( tenth century , but probably painted in the eleventh century ) : " In // the stillness of a mountain gorge , bare trees stand against thin mists . Those in the foreground are dark and distinct ; further back they fade to pale silhouettes " ( p. 32 ) . Later Chinese painters , however , often seem to have avoided the use of atmospheric perspective even where the subject matter would em to demand it . Fig. 10.6 shows The Orchard Pavilion by the fourteenthcentury painter Huang Kung-wang ; Loehr ( 1980 ) quotes Osvald Siren 's comment that this is " among the noblest of all the Chinese ink-paintings ' at have been preserved . " As Loehr points out : " There are no tone values speak of , and hence no atmosphere . The trees are constructed of horizonLi and vertical strokes , lacking individuality . Yet all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flatness of this painting produced by the absence of atmospheric erspective is reinforced by three other factors : the almost uniform distribution of the marks , the predominantly horizontal and vertical emphasis of the rushstrokes used to represent the trees , and the use of horizontal oblique rojection for the houses . In addition , any suggestion of illusion is destroyed y the presence of a written inscription and a number of seals . he Reversal of Normal Atmospheric Perspective Dire modern artists have gone a step further and reversed the normal rules n atmospheric perspective . In john Nash ' s Canal Bridge , Sydneyh Gargends // Bath ( color plate 3 ) , the tonal contrasts in the foreground of the painting are relatively muted . The area of greatest tonal contrast occurs at the top of the painting between the trees in the middle ground and the sky ; and the areas of next greatest contrast lie in the sunlit building and the strip of canal beyond the bridge , and in the bridge itself . There are no strong tonal contrasts in the immediate foreground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and background areas are pulled forward into the surface of the picture . The normal rules governing the use of color in atmospheric perspective are also reversed in this painting . The warmest tones in the painting are in the background : the windows of the building at the back are painted in Indian red , and the chimneys are orange . In contrast , there are no warm tones in the foreground , except for a few strokes of orange-brown in the tree on the right . This reversal of the normal rules of atmospheric perspective as they apply to color is even more evident in some of the landscape paintings by Paul Nash ( John Nash 's better-known brother ) . In many of his later paintings , such as in Monster Field , 1939 and Landscape of the Moon 's Last Phase , 1944 , the warmest and most fully saturated colors are in the background at the top of the painting in the form of a red sky or red clumps of trees , while the colors in the foreground are cooler and more muted . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the painting is in dull greens , blues , browns , and ochers , and the strong perspective effect of a receding line of trees is countered by the warm pink of the clouds in the distance . This painting also includes a particularly subtle device for flattening the picture : the ball on the top of the pillar in the foreground and the moon in the background are exactly the same size and shape , implying that they lie at the same depth . A somewhat similar device , but in a rather less obvious form , appears in Monet 's Rocks at Port Coton ( fig. 10.4 ) . Here the silhouette of the rocks and the cliff in the background is echoed by the similar silhouette of the rocks in the foreground . Finally , in Gris 's Breakfast ( color plate 6 and fig. 12.2 ) , the normal rules governing atmospheric perspective are again reversed by placing the warmest and most fully saturated areas of color at the top of the painting . Most of the picture is in dull browns , grays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parcel and the coffeepot lid are in red , bringing the top of the picture , where one would expect to find the greatest depth , toward the spectator . In this painting the reversal of the normal rules for atmospheric perspective is combined with the use of a form of inverted linear perspective , implied by the diverging edges of the rectangular forms imposed on the underlying composition in . axonometric projection. // Techniques for Flattening the Picture Based on the Denotation Systems Silhouettes and Line Drawings Silhouettes by themselves give very little impression of three-dimensional depth , so the images in pictures based on silhouettes , like Picasso 's Rites of Spring ( fig. 3.8 ) , are already inherently flat . Line drawings and fully optical pictures can both give a strong impression of depth , but only fully optical pictures which give off rays of light with , in Brook Taylor 's words , " All the same Circumstances of Direction , Strength of Light and Shadow , and Colour , as they would do so from the corresponding Parts of the real Objects seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line drawings can never give a complete illusion of depth because the lines are always so patently on the picture surface . Thus the contrast between the apparent depth in the pictorial image , and the flatness of the picture as a configuration of picture primitives represented by marks , will normally be greater in a line drawing than it will be in a silhouette or a fully optical picture : in a silhouette the balance will always tip toward flatness , whereas in a frilly optical picture it will tip toward an illusion of depth . In a pure line drawing in which the lines are all more or less of the same thickness , and there is little or no facture , there is little distinction to be made between the picture primitives and the marks that represent these primitives . The lines that constitute these primitives form configurations on the picture surface , and the geometry of these configurations is of course identical with the geometry of the projections of the edges , contours , and other scene primitives that these lines represent . We see . these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines which represent them , and lie directly over them , belong to the picture surface . Thus these edges and contours draw the lines back into the scene , while the lines in turn draw the edges and contours forward into the picture surface , flattening the pictorial image . As I have suggested above , a variety of factors can draw attention to the marks that represent picture primitives , such as the physical nature of the marks or the quality of execution . In Chu Ta 's Magnolia ( fig. 10.9 ) , the manner of execution is very apparent : Its most captivating quality is a combination of energy and elegance in the flowers , realized iii their shapes , their spacing , and their brushwork . Contrasting with the stately forms of the flowers are the brittle flicks describing small boughs . ' 1/u ' . Magnolia is the work of . t mature artist conscious of his powers , which he is not Itt.uh to display . ( Loehr , I9KU , p.302 ) // These qualities draw our attention to the brushstrokes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geometry of these brushstrokes also coincides with the geometry of the picture primitives they represent . We can thus speak of a tension between the three-dimensional primitives of the pictorial image on one hand , and the two-dimensional picture primitives and the physicality of the marks representing these primitives on the other . Mixed Denotation Systems In Western illusionistic painting , in photographs , and in TV pictures , every point on the picture surface represents some part of the array of light from the real scene . In contrast , in Chinese paintings , Japanese woodcuts , Persian miniature paintings , Byzantine mosaics , and Cubist paintings , it is common to find text sharing the picture surface with the pictorial image . Such inscriptions draw attention to the picture surface . The surface on which they are printed or written is essentially two-dimensional and has , in relation to the characters themselves , no denotational function . But at the same time , this surface stands for part of the depicted scene : in the Orchard Pavilion ( fig. 10.6 ) , the characters share this surface with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , these parts of the image are brought forward onto the picture surface . Similarly , the Persian miniature Laila and Majnum at School ( fig. 10.2 ) contains numerous inscriptions within the frame , both on the depicted surface of the building and on the real surface of the painting . The names of Jeremiah and Moses are inscribed above the lunette showing Scenes from the Life of Abraham in the mosaics at Ravenna ( fig. 14.9 ) ; three seals appear within the frame of the Hiroshige print shown in fig. 10.3 ; and Gris 's Breakfast ( color plate 6 and fig. 12.2 ) includes part of a printed newspaper en collage . In all these cases , the inclusion of printed or written characters within the frame draws attention to the surface of the picture and flattens the pictorial image onto this surface . Laila and Majnum at School also contains a pictorial device that looks strange to Western eyes but is common in Persian miniature painting : parts of the depicted scene leak out past the frame into the surrounding surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to what it would be in a Western painting , where every part of the surface depicts some part of a view of a scene . But the surface on which that part of the tree that lies outside the frame is painted either has no denotational function or stands for surrounding space . Like the confusion of drawing systems in this painting , // the confusion of denotation systems is another device that draws attention to the picture as a surface . Ben Nicholson 's Girl in a Mirror ( fig. 10.7 ) provides a final example of a picture containing a mixture of denotation systems . In this drawing the reflection of the face in the mirror looks more real than the face itself the caption // face is drawn in silhouette , in outline only ; but the reflection is a true line drawing , with the addition of local tone . Notice , too , that the " transparency " of the drawing of the window stay , the girl 's finger against her arm , and her ring against her hand are yet other devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , rather than as parts of an apparently three-dimensional image . If a picture is to work convincingly as an illusion , the denotation system within the frame must be consistent . Any inconsistency ? the inclusion of text , allowing parts of the picture to leak out past the frame , the inclusion of real objects as in Cubist painting , or the use of inconsistent mixtures of systems ? destroys the illusion , flattens the pictorial image , and draws attention to the picture as a collection of marks on the surface rather than a glimpse of the real world . It is not difficult to see the practical , social functions of pictures that provide useful technical information , a good representation , or an illusion . We need to know the true shapes of objects in engineering drawings and X-ray photographs ; we need to be able to recognize objects in road signs at a distance or under poor weather conditions ; we need to be able to see the three-dimensional shapes of objects in pictures in order to recognize the objects in them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the illusion that we are taking part in it ourselves . But what purpose could there be in seeking to destroy the elements of three-dimensionality or illusion in a picture ? There seem to have been at least four reasons why artists might have wanted to do this , and these motives , or mixtures of them , are to be found in the art of a number of different periods and cultures . The Avoidance of Idolatry Both Christianity and Islam have prohibitions against idolatry , the sin of worshiping God 's creatures rather than God himself . In Christianity this prohibition is expressed in the second commandment . Nevertheless , many religions have felt the need to tell the stories of that religion and to teach its beliefs in the form of pictures . The way to do this , and at the same time to avoid idolatry , was to prevent the worshiper from mistaking the images of God for God himself by setting them within a spatial system that was clearly different from the everyday corporeal world . In Byzantine mosaics , this was achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uniform surface texture , inverted perspective combined with an inconsistent mixture of other drawing systems , and the inclusion of text within the frame . // Persian miniature painting characteristically contains mixtures of drawing systems and mixtures of denotation systems . The origin of these inconsistencies probably lies in the mixture of Eastern and Western influences to which Persian artists were subject : fifteenth-century Persian painting was influenced by both Chinese and Byzantine painting ( Robinson , 1967 , p. 32 ) . For example , in Laila and Majnum at School ( fig. 10.2 ) , the use of oblique projection and the way in which the foliage of the tree is set against a plain ground on the right of the painting seem typically Chinese ; but the incongruous mixture of drawing systems ( versions of oblique projection and vertical oblique projection ) , and the way in which the whole surface within the frame is used to represent features of the scene , are more typically Byzantine . These mixtures of systems also play a part in flattening the picture surface , a function that seems very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mixture of drawing and denotation systems , destroying the illusion of real space , is so characteristic of Persian miniature painting that it is tempting to wonder whether its continued use in secular illustrations may not have been influenced by the Islamic prohibition of figural representation in religious art . ' Composition Greek vase painting had its origin in the abstract painted decoration of the geometric period , but during the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. representations of figures of men and animals began to appear , originally in pure silhouette ( fig. 14.1 ) . Because the outlines of these figures are irregular , and silhouettes give , in any case , very little impression of depth , such figures can be represented without apparent distortion on a curved surface . Problems arise , however , in representing rectangular objects on a curved surface like the surface of a vase , because from most directions of view the lines representing straight edges in the scene will appear curved , and the edges of the rectangular objects they represent will therefore appear distorted . Although this problem will occur with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection , which , of all the drawing systems , gives the least illusion of depth . For example , the ground plane in pictures in orthogonal projection is represented by a horizontal line , and this can fit without much distortion onto the curved surface of a vase because it corresponds to the edge of a horizontal cross-section and will appear straight when viewed at eye level . This may explain why the Greek vase painters persisted in using orthogonal projection until a relatively late period , rather than developing // the use of systems such as oblique projection which provide better representations of rectangular objects . The compositional problems involved in representing rectangular objects on a curved surface are different from those which arise with a flat surface . In vertical oblique projection the lines representing edges in the third dimension are vertical , and these lines can sit comfortably on the surface of a flat , rectangular picture because their directions coincide with the vertical axis of the picture surface . But on a convex surface such as the surface of a vase the lines representing these edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of horizontal surfaces such as the top of a table . Perhaps this is the reason why vertical oblique projection was not used in Greek vase painting for representing rectangular objects , even when the subject matter , such as that of the famous painting by Exekias of Ajax and Odysseus playing dice ( Rawson , 1969 , p. 152 ) , would suggest that its use would be highly appropriate . In horizontal oblique projection the orthogonals are horizontal and so can fit more naturally on the belly of a vase ; and in fact there are a number of instances of the use of horizontal oblique projection in Greek vase painting from the fifth century onwards , although these are mainly confined to representations of chariots . Similar problems arise with oblique projection . Oblique projection is a perfectly appropriate system to use on the surface of a scroll painting like Lady Wenji 's Return to China ; far more appropriate , in fact , than using perspective because pictures in oblique projection can be extended indefinitely in any direction without distortion , whereas in pictures in perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear distorted once the angle of view begins to exceed about 25 ? ( Dubery and Willats , 1983 ) . However , it is difficult to imagine a painting in oblique projection like Lady Wenji 's Return to China fitting satisfactorily onto the curved surface of a Greek vase , because rectangular objects would appear distorted . Oblique projection does not appear in Greek vase painting until the late stages of development , and even then it is used only intermittently . Many of the later masterpieces of Greek vase painting such as Leave-taking ( fig. 11.3a ) still employed orthogonal projection , with some foreshortening in a horizontal direction . Philosophical and Aesthetic Balance If there is one philosophical idea that can be said to underlie Chinese art it is that of the balance between Yin and Yang qualities : // Because the Chinese perceive the universe as consisting of contrasting and complementary Yin and Yang qualities and substances , brush and black ink in their infinite line-and-surface , bone-and-flesh , thin-and-thick , and dry-and-wet relationships can represent just about everything in a monochrome world . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in their purest state , produce a lustrous black and , diluted with water , a full range of translucent grays ? have been a vital factor in determining the nature of Chinese painting . ( Fong and Hearn , 1981/1982 , p. 5 ) This balance finds its purest form in calligraphy , in the contrast between black ink characters on white paper . However , as the passage above makes clear , this balance can take many forms in Chinese painting , and among them , I suggest , is the balance between the two dimensions of the surface of the picture and the three dimensions of depicted space . The scholar-painters of China would , I suspect , have found most Western paintings unbearably vulgar in their lack of aesthetic balance and their insistence on the representation of illusionistic depth at the expense of the picture surface . By the end of the thirteenth century ? that is , by the end of the Sung period ? Chinese painters had solved all the problems involved in representing shape , and in particular the problem of creating illusionistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 ) . They did , however , solve these problems in their own way . In place of chiaroscuro , which they called " receding and protruding painting , " the Chinese painters developed a technique of thickening and thinning the line and shading it away toward the interior of the form in order to represent the curvature of the surface at right angles to the contour as the form turns away ( Rawson , 1969 , pp. 109 , 113 ) . Instead of linear perspective , they adopted oblique projection for representing individual rectangular objects such as tables and houses . In the relatively rare instances in which a coherent ground plane exists in Chinese painting , it is merely implied by the presence of rectangular objects ( fig. 1.2 ) , whereas in Western Renaissance painting the scene is built up on the ground plane as a foundation : establishing this ground plane was the whole object of Alberti 's costruzione legittiiva . For representing depth in landscape the Chinese painters used a variety of techniques , including that aspect of perspective which entails the diminution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if objects of such disparate sizes as trees , huts , and mountains are to be shown in one and the same picture . The most common technique for representing depth in Chinese painting , however , exploited the simple device of using light and dark regions to represent the alternations of figure and ground . In this technique death is represented by a series of overlapping regions , dark at the // top but gradually fading away at the bottom , rising up through the picture and suggesting a series of mountain peaks rising from misty valleys : a favorite subject in Chinese painting . In the Northern Sung landscape illustrated in fig. 10.8 , the sharp outlines of the dark areas of tone at the top of a mountain peak bring the figure forward against the lighter tone of the ground . As this tone fades away toward the bottom of the region , it provides the ground for the next , darker area of tone representing a plane that is closer to the viewer : " The mountain forms of the Metropolitan 's scroll are superimposed in overlapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no receding ground plane to link or hold the major elements : only the mist that curls through the valleys unites them " ( Fong and Hearn , 1981/1982 , p. 15 ) . An additional and quite separate device for representing depth , which had been fully mastered by the end of the Sung period , was the use of atmospheric perspective . In the landscape illustrated in fig. 10.8 , these two techniques are combined , but this was not always the case . In some late Southern Sung landscapes , atmospheric perspective is the only device used to create depth , while in some landscapes of the Yuan period ( 1279 ? 1367 ) , it is absent altogether . Painting in the Yuan period was decisively different from Sung painting . During this period , painting was no longer a matter of simply describing external reality . The scholar-painters of the Yuan period aimed at self-expression : hsin-hsueh , " the realization of what is already within oneself , " rather than li-hsueh , " the objective study of things within the universe " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result , painting during the Yuan period and the subsequent Ming ( 1368 ? 1644 ) and Ch'ing ( 1644 ? 1911 ) periods became increasingly abstract , with less emphasis on the representation of depth and more emphasis on finding pictorial equivalents for the external world , expressed within the two-dimensional space of the picture surface . Consequently , we find during these periods a considerable use of pictorial devices intended to flatten the image , rather than give it depth . I have already drawn attention to some of these devices in The Orchard Pavilion ( fig. 1(1.6) . The use of horizontal oblique projection as the drawing system for the huts emphasizes the flatness of the image . There is almost no significant use of atmospheric perspective or the technique of overlapping planes . The trees are drawn as characters rather than as representations ; and because the marks by which they are represented are all more or less the same size over the whole surface , there is little or no texture gradient , and ( what amounts to the same thing ) little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epth is represented iii this picture , but it is balanced by the devices that draw attention to the picture surface . In the Ch'ing period this emphasis on the picture surface was achieved by calligraphic abstractions , as in Chu Ta 's Magnolia ( fig. 10.9 ) . In a painting by Tao-chi ( a near contemporary of Chu Ta ) , the Ten Thousand Ugly Ink Dots , this technique is taken about as far as it can go , so that the painting becomes a statement about painting rather than a representation of a scene : In Richard Edward 's felicitous characterization , " Ugly Ink-dots is above all an artist 's statement about art . " The painting , in other words , is not a picture representing a thicket , a homestead , a cliff , and a cavern , but an assemblage of forms reminiscent of such motifs , though primarily an exposition of boisterous brushwork . The scroll exemplifies nicely how far a Chinese painter will go in abstractions : here the technique as such becomes the subject-matter . ( Loehr , 1980 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , III . uni // The Response to Photographic Realism The invention of photography in the 1840s marked the end of a long period in which depiction was based on physical optics , and the beginning of a new period in art . Artists reacted to the invention of photography in a number of ways . One was to emphasize the role of painting as a means of expression , primarily self-expression . A similar motive seems to have informed painting during the Yuan period in China , in contrast to the desire on the part of painters in the preceding Sung period to find ways of representing external reality . And of course , expression in painting does not necessarily involve creating an illusion of reality ; in fact , creating an illusion may well interfere with expression . Consequently , just as expressive painting in the Yuan period tended to become flatter , so painting after the invention of photography also became flatter . It is hard to look at the Ten Thousand Ugly Ink Dots without thinking of the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Jackson Pollock . Another motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic . Gombrich quotes the German art critic Konrad Lange , writing at the beginning of this century , who believed that aesthetic pleasure was rooted in the tension and balance between art and illusion : " Following the over-emphasis of the idea of nature for a time , we now have the stressing of the idea of art . . . . after the illusion of depth , artists now strive with equal passion to emphasize the plane " ( Gombrich , 1960/1988 , p. 238 ) . Yet another reason why paintings tended to become flatter was the abandonment of perspective as the only possible basis for painting . A number of artists and critics argued that representing what we perceive is not just a matter of replicating the array of light from a scene , but of representing our experience of the world as we move through it : an argument that led to the renunciation of perspective and the rise of Cubism . " Perspective is as accidental a thing as lighting .... The plastic image does not move : it must be complete at first sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1912 , pp. 384-406 ) . And of course , once perspective had been abandoned , illusion was no longer possible . However , there may have been an even more powerful psychological motive that led painters , after the invention of photography , to insist on paintings as symbol systems made up of pictorial devices that could be manipulated at will rather than as passive surfaces capturing the light from the scene . What modern painters wanted to be above all was creative and original , and this was clearly incompatible with carrying out a task that could be performed just as well or better by a machine . The concept of originality was much debated among artists in the nineteenth century . Traditionalists associated originality with the idea of ' // genius : a unique ability that set the individual apart from the common herd . A newer and more " democratic " definition of originality saw it as an innate characteristic of every human being ( Anfam et al . 1987 ) .2 But in either case , photography presented artists with a very direct threat . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as portraiture or the recording of events could be carried out much more quickly and cheaply by photography than they could by an artist . On a somewhat higher level , it challenged their technical skill , traditionally the artists ' main stock-in-trade : The faculty of photographs to reproduce the most minute objects in view , rendered solely by light and shade , had seldom been approached in painting or drawing . The exquisite tonal delicacy and miraculous uniformity with which natural objects were simulated elicited the highest praise , but also the most profound despair , from artists who felt themselves incapable of matching the virtuosity of the picture-making machine . ( Scharf , 1979 , pp. 12 ? 13 ) But at the highest level of all , the invention of photography threatened the artist 's status as a creative human being . Thus it became increasingly necessary for artists to insist on painting as a symbol system based on pictorial devices which were not under the control of external stimuli , but which could be manipulated at will like the symbols of language . When these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the illusion of depth disappeared and pictures became increasingly flat . CHAPTER ELEVEN Anomaly in the Service of Expression In the past , little distinction was made between pictures that merely conveyed technical information and pictures that performed some higher function ; in most past cultures the concept of " art " in the modern sense hardly existed . In more recent times , however , we have come to think of " artistic " pictures as a separate class , and there seems to be a consensus that what separates artistic pictures from pictures in general is that they are expressive . For Gowans ( 1979 ) , for example , " Art nowadays is an activity defined by , and a vehicle for , the self-expression of artists " ( p. 248 ) ? rather an empty and depressing prospect . However , expression need not always be self-expression : artists in many other cultures have used pictures in order to express beliefs and emotions that were shared by religious groups or the community as a whole . Part of the expressive quality of a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from its subject matter , but it has often been suggested that there may be a connection between the formal properties of a picture and its expressive qualities . Kandinsky , the leading German Expressionist , and the first and probably the most important of the pioneers of abstract art , began his painting career in Munich at the time when Theodore Lipps was lecturing at the University of Munich on his theory of empathy : the subjective identification of the viewer with abstract forms in painting ( Teuber , 1980 ) . More recently , Goodman ( 1968 ) has suggested that certain formal qualities are " symptomatic " of artistic pictures as compared with pictures such as engineering drawings . One of these symptoms , Goodman suggesion is " repleteness " a term he Proposed in order to separate works of // art from pictures that merely provide factual information . In an electrocardiograph reading , for example , only the shape of the graph is significant , whereas if the same shape were to be employed in a Japanese print as a representation of the outline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tone would be potentially relevant to its interpretation . " Exemplification , " another term suggested by Goodman , refers to the fact that works of art may exemplify certain ideas or feelings metaphorically , although they do not contain them literally . A painting or drawing may literally possess any number of properties such as tone and color , and a representational picture literally denotes the objects represented . " But to perceive what a painter expresses , it is necessary to go beyond the literal " ( Blank , Massey , Gardner , and Winner , 1984 , p. 127 ) . Thus a simple stick figure of a tree is unlikely to be read as expressing any mood ; but if the tree is shown devoid of leaves , and with its branches bowing close to the ground , it may be read as expressing sadness . In practice , both means of expression ? the nature of a painting 's subject matter and the use of expressive formal properties ? are usually employed together , and the way a picture is drawn or painted may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the balance between the emotional charge carried by the overt subject of a painting and the formal means by which this subject has been expressed may vary a great deal . At one extreme we might put Abstract Expressionism : the attempt to produce a painting that is expressive , but freed from the need to represent the usual subject matter of painting . Painting of this kind is often compared with music , which can be highly expressive without making use of any overt subject matter . At the other extreme , Surrealist painting , which is normally highly representational , is generally considered to be very expressive ; but there seem to be two kinds of Surrealist painters : painters like Salvador Dali who achieve their effects through the use of an emotive subject matter , and painters like Giorgio de Chirico or Rene Magritte who used unusual or incongruous structures in their paintings although their overt subject matter is often quite prosaic . The majority of Dab 's pictures are carried out in a meticulously realistic , almost photographic style , and some of them are actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the outrageous and repulsive nature of their subject matter rather than their formal qualities ( Orwell , 198(1) . Compared with Mali 's paintings the subject matter of Giorgio de Chirico 's Mystery and Melancholy of a Street ( fig. 11.1 ) is not especially remarkable , although the shadow of a hidden statue , thrown across the otherwise empty street , may perhaps convey a sense of menace . Otherwise , the picture shows only , t street scene it ) bright sunlight with buildings with FUNCTIONS OF REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS les on either side , an empty four-wheeled van , and a girl playing with a p . ' The powerful suggestion of mystery and melancholy that this paintconveys thus seems to have little to do with its overt subject matter . her , the effect seems to be produced by the incongruous mixture of ving systems on which the picture is based . The arcades to either side of caption // the picture have different vanishing points , while the van is drawn in an approximation to oblique projection , so that the spatial system of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that a defining characteristic of poetic speech , as distinct from ordinary speech , is its use of unusual or ungrammatical structures for expressive purposes : The discussion centres around two observations . The first is that ungrammatical sentences tend to occur far more frequently in poetry than in prose . . . . The second is that although , inevitably , we recognize these deviant sentences as being deviant , it is sometimes also the case that they are felt not to be deviant within the context of the poem . ( Thorne , 1972 , p. 192 ) Thorne illustrated this by analyzing John Donne 's " A Nocturnall Upon S. Lucies Day " He points out that Donne 's poem contains a number of ungrammatical constructions such as ( met ) who am their Epitaph , and I am every dead thing , I . . . am the grave of all , and Yea plants , yea stones detest and love , and suggests that " It seems likely that these linguistic facts underlie the sense of chaos and breakdown of natural order which many literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 , p. 193 ) . Similarly , Soby ( 1966 ) , describing the spatial systems in de Chirico 's Care Montparnasse ( The Melancholy of Departure ) , 1914 , painted in the same year as The Mystery and Melancholy of the Street , wrote that " geometry has been wilfully altered for purposes of poetic suggestion " ( p. 71 ) . Thus within the context of de Chirico 's work these mixtures of systems are not " mistakes , " but the means by which the artist obtained a particular expressive effect . ' The subject matter of Francis Bacon 's Three Studies of Lucian Freud ( fig. 11.2 ) is , again , not in itself remarkable , except perhaps for the inclusion of the abstract space frame and the tense , awkward pose of the seated figure . Instead , much of the sense of unease which this picture conveys comes from the tension between the rigid space frame drawn in distorted perspective and the painterly handling of the figure it encloses . These examples suggest that just as some poets have used anomalous or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used anomalous or " ungrammatical " pictorial structures to serve expressive ends . It would be a mistake , however , to suppose that when anomalies occur in artists ' pictures they are always there to serve some expressive purpose . I During periods of transition in art history , for example , mixtures of drawing systems may occur for reasons that have little to do with expression . To modern eyes , the mixture of drawing systems in Giovanni de Paolo 's Birth of Si . John the Baptist ( fig. 8.14 ) may seem expressive ; but this incongruous immixture of systems is wore likely to have arisen as a result of the artist 's // struggle with perspective . Similarly , many of the scenes in the frescoes in the upper church of San Francesco at Assisi contain incongruous mixtures of drawing systems , or incorrect versions of perspective ; but it is difficult to know if any of these anomalies were deliberately introduced to serve some expressive purpose , and how many resulted from the artist 's or artists ' inability to handle perspective . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spatial system from top to bottom in the Vision of the Thrones may have been intended to portray " a change from one reality to another , from a material to a visionary world . " This idea is a very attractive one , and to a modern spectator the use of two spatially incompatible systems within the same painting does carry with it a strong suggestion of the supernatural ; but how deliberate this choice of different systems was seems rather uncertain . Nearly all the frescoes in the upper church at Assisi contain mixtures of drawing systems of one kind or another , and by no means all of them deal with visions . On balance , it seems likely that the mixtures of systems in the " vision " frescoes , which to us look like the result of deliberate choice , may have been just happy accidents . A middle course of interpretation is also possible . It may be that these anomalies occurred because the artist was still struggling with the problems of perspective ; but that he was content to leave them unresolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at some level sensitive to their expressive effect . ' A similar problem of interpretation arises with children 's drawings . Drawings by young children often seem especially expressive to adults , and it is just this expressiveness which seems to give them a status as works of art . But much of this expressive quality comes from the anomalies they contain , and as Gardner has pointed out , these anomalies , however charming they may seem to adults , may merely be the result of the child 's inability to produce the correct form : " Even as a metaphor by the young child may be a simple overgeneralization , with a word merely carrying a broader meaning for him than it does for most adults , so , too , drawings by the young child may be uncontrolled forms which come forth simply because the youngster is unable to produce anything more faithful to the real world " ( Gardner , 1980 , p. 100 ) . Winner ( 1982 ) makes much the same point . Because of the difficulty of assessing children 's expressive intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of their expressive qualities . The three artists ' pictures which I have chosen all contain examples of pictorial anomalies used for expressive purposes . In the case of the first two examples the supposition that the use of these anomalies was in some sense deliberate  --   --  that is , that they are not merely accidental  --  can only be inferred from the aptness of these anomalies to their subject matter . With // Klee 's Naked on the Bed the evidence is more direct , because Klee has given us some account of his intentions in his diaries and notebooks . Leave-taking Fig. 11.3a shows a Greek vase painting of the middle or third quarter of the fifth century B.C. The style of this painting is known as white-ground painting : the lines are drawn in relief in black glaze on a white ground . Originally the figures in these vase paintings were covered with a thin wash of color , but in most cases these colors have since either altered or disappeared . The vases ( or " lekythoi " ) on which the painting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were either buried with the dead or thrown on the funeral pyre . Leave-taking is attributed to the Achilles painter , who also produced red-figure vase paintings : red silhouettes with black lines on a black ground . Red-figure painting , like the figure of Herakles on a vase by the Kleophrades painter ( fig. 14.5 ) , is often skillful and robust ; but Greek vase painting is at its most expressive in the white-ground lekythoi . The expressive quality of the Leave-taking is no doubt due in part to the nature of its subject matter : " In the wonderful picture of the young warrior and the seated woman the whole expression is given by the simple presence of one fair young creature with another : the picture says without words that the young man did not come home from the war " ( Pfuhl , 1955 , p. 68 ) . In other similar paintings the subject matter is also directly related to mourning and the cult of the dead . In one painting an apparition of the dead youth stands by the grave while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sleep and Death lay the young warrior in his grave , and in another a girl brings gifts to the grave while the spirit of the dead youth looks on . In yet another , a girl mourns while a servant brings wine for a libation to the dead . However , it can not be only the overt subject matter of these paintings which carries this expression because many of them simply portray scenes from domestic life . There is no obvious way in which the painting shown in fig. 11.4 , also attributed to the Achilles painter , commemorates the dead : it shows a lady handing a bundle of clothes to a young maid . And yet in its way this painting seems almost as expressive as the Leave-taking , or the scenes by the tomb . The emotional content of these paintings can perhaps be summed up as a mixture of sadness and reverence , and these qualities are expressed in part by die way in which the participants tail to meet each others ' gaze , and instead withdraw into their own thoughts . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection is represented by eye direction . To quote Pfuhl again : Thus , in a vase which is not even very fine in drawing and is therefore not reproduced here , the dead youth returns the young woman 's greeting shyly , as if the sight of life in its bloom made him hesitate . Another picture is no less touching : the girl with the basket of gifts looks at the youth muffled in his cloak , yet he does not return her gaze , but looks stilly and absently in front of him . The downward look , emphasised by the staff , and the dark muffling garment , speak death and mourning . ( Pfuhl , 1955 , p. 71 ) This same kind of feeling ? a combination of sadness , gravity , and reverence ? seems to pervade the painting illustrated in fig. 1 1.4 , although the subject of this painting is purely domestic . The lady gazes solemnly into the girl 's eyes , while the girl 's own eyes meet her gaze shyly , or even perhaps seem slightly downcast . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that both figures are thinking about the dead ? In the red-figure vases , in contrast , eye direction , where it is significant at all , seems merely to indicate what the person depicted is attending to . For example , in the vase by the Kleophrades painter to which I have already referred ( fig. 14.5 ) , Herakles is looking at the Delphic tripod , which he has stolen from Apollo . But in the funeral lekythoi , eye direction seems to signal something far more subtle , which can be characterized by saying that the persons depicted are attending to their own internal thoughts rather than to any external object . Baron-Cohen , Campbell , Karmiloff-Smith , et al . ( 1995 ) have shown that eye direction can be a powerful indicator of mental states , and they list four pieces of knowledge about eyes that even quite young children normally possess . The first is that eyes are for seeing , and that for a person to see something their eyes need to be open . Most children know this from at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of someone 's gaze indicates what they are interested in or attending to . The third is that people use their eyes to communicate what they are interested in to someone else . And finally , they found that by the age of 3 or 4 years most children know that if a person is looking up or away , this is a sign that that person is thinking . Presumably eye direction is interpreted in this way because in the absence of an external object to be looked at , the person is assumed to be attending to his or her own thoughts . Eye direction in the red-figure paintings , where it is significant at all , merely indicates what the person depicted is attending to , and corresponds to the second stage of awareness described by BaronCohen et al . In the white-ground paintings , iii contrast , the eye directions of the figures represented iii these paintings correspond to their final stage and show that these figures are absorbed in their own thoughts . // most famous passages in the Bible , Jesus speaks to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father . " The subject was a common one in the later Middle Ages and was represented in two different ways . In one , Christ turns back toward the standing Magdalene who bends forward as he walks away ; in the other , the Magdalene kneels as Christ turns back toward her ( Offner , 1981 ) . Three versions of this second type are shown here : the first by an unidentified icon painter ( fig. 11.5 ) and the second by Giotto ( fig. 11.6 ) . The third version ( color plate 4 ) is attributed to the Master of the Lehman Crucifixion , so called by Offner after a Crucifixion now in the Robert Lehman Collection in the Metropolitan Museum , New York ( Davis , 1988 ) . This painter5 was working in Florence during the second half of the fourteenth century ; Offner describes this version as " very similar " to a panel by the Master of the Fabriano Altarpiece ( reproduced in Offner , 1981 , sec. 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these paintings is a highly dramatic and emotional one . According to Barasch ( 1990 ) the essence of this drama is the contrast between carnal and spiritual love . Mary 's love is unambiguous : Her leaning to sensual love may perhaps explain her desire for physical touch , a desire emphasized in literary descriptions as well as in pictorial depictions . . . . The desire for physical touch is not usually characteristic of saints , and in no other saint , so far as we know , is it so overwhelming as in Mary Magdalen . This desire is , of course , an important feature in the background of Noli Inc tan ere . ( Barasch , 1990 , p. 176 ) Christ , however , withdraws from Mary 's attempt to touch him . In a number of examples , Barasch shows how this drama is expressed in terms of the gestures and stance of the participants . In an early example , Mary is kneeling and Christ extends his hand toward her , but the movement does not imply any rejection : it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's version ( fig. 11.6 ) , Christ 's gesture , Barasch argues , is much more ambiguous : it blesses , but it also rejects . In the predella panel by the Master of the Fabriano Altarpiece cited by Offner , Christ is moving away from the kneeling Magdalene but turns back to look at her and extends his arms toward her with outstretched fingers almost as if drawing her to him . In a later fresco in S. Trinita in Florence by the same painter , an almost similar gesture seems like one of rejection , and even perhaps horrified withdrawal . In Fra Angelico 's fresco in S. Marco the mood is much quieter : Mary spreads her hands in submission while Christ appears to be both blessing and rebuking her . In a version by an imitator of Mantegna in the National Gallery , London , Christ blesses Mary but shrinks away bona her . In a much biter version by Titian ? also in the National Gallery , a kneeling Mary supports // herself with one hand and stretches out the other , while Christ withdraws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all these paintings the emotions of the participants are reflected in their gestures , and these gestures are represented figuratively in the picture . But in the versions by Giotto and the Master of the Lehman Crucifixion illustrated in fig. 11.6 and color plate 4 the theme of touching , and the rejection of touching , are represented in formal as well as figurative terms . Barasch describes the way in which the drama of the scene is expressed by the gestures and stance of the participants in the version by Giotto , but also draws attention to a compositional element in the painting noted by Rintelen ( 1923 ) : the composition is organized round two diagonal lines like a letter X , one arm of which follows the outline of the angel 's wing and continues through the top edge of the rocks , while the other follows the line of Christ 's outstretched arm and the direction of his gaze , and runs through Mary 's body to her feet . Christ 's outstretched hand is placed at the intersection of these two diagonal lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw attention to Christ 's hand , and in particular to the way in which the tip of his thumb is just touching the outline representing the upper edge of the rock . Above and to the left of the point of intersection , two of his fingers just penetrate this outline . This touching and penetration takes place within the two-dimensional space of the picture surface ; clearly Christ 's hand is in front of the rock in the three-dimensional scene . Technically , then , there is a false attachment at the center of the composition . It is possible , of course , to argue that this may merely be an accident , and that Giotto may simply not have noticed this anomaly . But as a compositional device this false attachment seems so apt in the context of the subject of the painting that it is tempting to suppose that Giotto used it deliberately in order to express the meaning of the painting in formal terms , reinforcing and repeating the message carried by Christ 's stance and gestures : " The contrapposto of Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mary Magdalen , and the desire to withdraw and avoid her touch . The outstretched hand of Christ is typical in its ambiguity : it is rejecting , but also has features of blessing " ( Barasch , 1990 , p. 180 ) . On a formal level , the coincidences and near coincidences between Christ 's fingers and the outline of the rock which forms the boundary of Mary 's space repeat the same message . Christ 's fingertips are just penetrating Mary 's space to bless her , but at the same time they emphasize the boundary between them : " Thus far , " he seems to be saying , " but no further . " In contrast , in the icon painting reproduced here ( fig. 11.5 ) , in the version by Fra Angelico , and in the // versions by Titian and an imitator of Mantegna , both in the National Gallery , London , it is only the gestures of the participants that carry the meaning of the painting . Similar false attachments and near false attachments appear in the Noli me Tangere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) . Here the outline of the hillside , which represents the skyline in three-dimensional space , divides the picture surface into two regions . Mary inhabits the dark earthly region below the skyline : the tips of the fingers of her left hand just reach the boundary between the two regions , while those of her right hand just penetrate this boundary . The lower half of the figure of Christ also inhabits the dark , earthly region , but the upper half inhabits the golden region of the sky above . The tips of Christ 's fingers almost , but not quite , reach the boundary between the earthly and heavenly regions . In terms of a representation of a three-dimensional scene we would have to count the relations between the fingers of the participants and the outline of the hillside as examples of false attachment , near false attachment , and avoidance of false attachment . But in terms of the two-dimensional geometry of the picture surface they provide examples of touching , withdrawal , and penetration : just those physical relations that could provide a metaphor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the anomalies in Leave-taking , this metaphor is so apt that it seems unlikely that the anomalies present in these two paintings were mere coincidences . Moreover , there is some physical evidence in the version by the Master of the Lehman Crucifixion that suggests that the spatial relations between the fingers and the outline of the hillside were deliberately contrived . An examination of the picture surface ' shows that the main outlines of the composition were drawn in first , using an incised line . Then the figure of Mary was painted in , with the hands in the present position . The landscape was painted in next ; but at the point where the outline of the hill passed behind Mary 's left hand the painter extended the contour of the hillside beyond the original incised line . This incised line , which is visible below the paint surface , touches the tip of the little finger of the right hand of the Magdalene , runs just below the thumb of her right hand , through the first joint of the little finger of the left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger of the left hand , and then rejoins the existing outline . Originally , then , at the underdrawing stage , the fingers of both hands would have penetrated the golden , heavenly space . At a later stage , however , the outline of the hill was altered so that the left hand would touch the boundary between the two figures , rather than extending beyond it . // The projection of the right hand beyond this boundary seems always to have been intended , and the positions of the incised lines show that Christ 's right hand was always intended to be in its present position . These observations suggest that the painter originally planned the layout of the painting in such a way that both Mary Magdalene 's hands penetrated into Christ 's " heavenly " space . At some point during the painting process he evidently realized that the painting would be more effective if the fingers of her left hand just touched the boundary of this space instead of penetrating it ; and the line of the hillside was changed so as to bring this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It serves no representational purpose ; but it does enrich the expressive quality of the picture by adding a third element of touching to the two original elements of penetration and withdrawal . It is hard not to believe that this change was deliberately effected in order to serve an expressive purpose . Paul Klee : Naked on the Bed , 1939 Successive stages of Klee 's career are characterized by the use of a number of different pictorial devices or motifs , and Marianne Teuber has shown that many of these are derived from or can be related to the psychological literature of the period . By 1905 Klee had read Mach 's Analysis of Sensations ; in July of that year he described Mach 's first illustration and exclaimed , " The object is surely dead . The sensation of the object is of first importance . The old-master school is finished " ( Teuber , 1980 , p. 2 ) . Some years later Klee began to make use of Mach 's reversible figure of a folded card in his paintings and drawings : it appears in Untitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teuber , 1976 ) , in Fantastic Architecture with the Rider , 1918 , and The Tightrope Walker , 1923 . Teuber ( 1980 ) goes on to trace the influence of other perceptual psychologists such as Schumann , Wertheimer , and Fuchs on Klee 's work as a painter and teacher . During his first year of teaching at the Bauhaus in 1921/22 , Klee showed his students how Schumann 's checkerboard experiments demonstrated perceptual grouping , and he had already made use of Schumann 's demonstrations in his own paintings : in 1915 he transformed a field of black and white diamonds from one of Schumann 's illustrations into the watercolor In the Garden of Franz Marc . By the end of the 1920s , Gestalt psychologists had been invited to lecture at the Bauhaus , and in 1930 the Bauhaus offered an entire course in psychology , with the emphasis on Gestalt psychology , as a part of the regular curriculum . I n his later works Klee also drew on Wertheimer essay on the " ' Theory of Form " ( I ' ) 23 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and good continuation . Motifs from Wertheimer 's illustrations appear transcribed into paintings like Child in Red , 1937 , and Blue Night , 1937 . Klee was thus well acquainted with the psychological literature on perception of the period , taught it to his students , and made use of it in his own paintings and drawings . In 1935 Klee began to suffer from a serious illness , which ultimately led to his death in 1940 . During 1936 he produced few paintings and drawings ; when he resumed work in 1937 he began to paint in a new style : heavy black lines arranged in simple patterns , together with areas of brilliant color . In these paintings the patterns of lines are purely two-dimensional , and Teuber ( 1976 ) has shown how they were derived from Wertheimer 's demonstrations of Gestalt principles . Klee continued to produce paintings in this style until his death , but in the last two years of his life he also produced a large number of paintings and drawings , some semi-abstract and some representational , in which the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.10 , The Park at Abien from the Vegetable Department , shows a painting typical of this style and period . In spite of the fact that none of the forms of which this picture is composed directly represents familiar objects , the way in which they are drawn strongly suggests a group of solid , three-dimensional shapes . With the exception of the sharp corner at the top , the drawing is composed of two kinds of junctions ? T-junctions and end-junctions  --  and the configurations of lines and junctions obey Huffman 's rule for drawings of smooth objects . As a result we interpret the lines in drawings of this kind as the occluding contours of smooth shapes . Fig. 11.7a shows a drawing that Klee produced in the same year entitled Little Baroque Basket . Like The Park at Abien , the shapes represented do not correspond to those of familiar objects , but they nevertheless look convincingly three-dimensional . Again there is one sharp corner , and the small closed form at the top contains a junction which is incorrect within the language of smooth forms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main forms are either end junctions , or T - junctions correctly representing points of occlusion . However , this drawing , unlike the drawing in The Park at Abien , contains a major inconsistency . If we trace the line in the middle of the drawing along its length , from the lower T-junction on the right to the upper T-junction on the left , it is apparent that the occluded surface lies to the right at the beginning of the line , but to the left at the end of the line . Hg . I I.7h makes this anomaly explicit . The directions of the arrows follow Huflinan 's convention that the occluding surface lies to the // right going in the direction of the arrows , and these arrows must always run from right to left along the top of a T-junction because the lower arm of a T-junction represents a contour that disappears behind the contour of the occluding surface represented by the top of the T ( fig. 5.7 ) . The question mark shows that somewhere along this line the directions of the arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line has changed its reference or " meaning , " thus apparently disobeying Huffman 's fundamental rule that a line must have the same meaning along its whole length . In drawings like those shown in fig. 1.14 , disobeying this rule results in an " impossible object , " but this is not the case in Little Baroque Basket . What has happened is that two correct T-junctions have been run together ; if these two junctions are separated , as shown in fig. 11.7c , it becomes clear that the original drawing represents two overlapping forms in intimate contact . As these two forms are brought together , the two T-junctions lose their orthogonality and become more transverse , until eventually they merge . As Koenderink ( 1990 ) emphasized , accidents like this ought to be avoided " like the plague . . . except when you explicitly want to exploit their effect " ( pp. 622-623 ) . In Little Baroque Basket , Klee seems merely to have been experimenting with this device : " I have carried out many experiments with laws and taken them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when a complication arises " ( Klee , 1961 , p. 454 ) . But exactly the same device appears in Klee 's Naked on the Bed ( color plate 5a ) , and here , I believe , Klee used this " complication " as a metaphor for the sexual act ( Willats , 1980 ) . Although the shapes in the drawing are only partially representational , they clearly represent a man and a woman , and the merging of the outlines of these shapes , representing contours that would normally be represented as separate ( color plate 5b ) , provides a metaphor for the union between the two figures . The two forms overlap in the center of the painting , and Klee marked the point of contact between the man and the woman by a subtle change of hue from blue to ocher in the body of the woman . This painting thus seems to illustrate Klee 's contention that " a picture representing a naked person must not be created by the laws of human anatomy , but only by those of compositional anatomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Early in his life Klee had used sexual intercourse as a metaphor for painting : " In the beginning the motif , insertion of energy , sperm " ( Klee , I %5 , entry 943 , 1914 ) . In Naked on the Bed , one of his last paintings , Klee used a complication in the formal structure as a metaphor for the sexual act . CHAPTER TWELVE Investigating the Nature of Depiction Perhaps one of the most profound changes to take place in painting between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was that painters became increasingly aware that there was more than one way of painting a picture . This led to an increasing self-consciousness on the part of painters about the techniques of depiction and , eventually , to an investigation of these techniques within painting itself . No doubt artists , or at least some artists , have always been highly conscious of the techniques of painting and drawing and the rules governing these techniques , as witness Leonardo 's notes and his projected treatise " On Painting , " and the many books by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospectiva pingendi and Durer 's account of perspective in his Underweysung der Messung . And no doubt there is a sense in which the act of painting is , in all but the most banal cases , in itself an experiment in the techniques of painting . But what seems to have been new in the twentieth century was the choice , by so many artists , of the techniques of painting , and painting itself , as the subject matter of painting . David Hockney made a distinction between what he called " technical paintings " in which the balance of interest is toward the form , and paintings in which the balance is toward the subject matter : " I use the word technical , ' in the sense that they 're about the techniques of painting , my painting , painting going on round me , as opposed to life . They 're statements in a way about painting " ( Hockney , 1976 , p. 150 ) . The three paintings analyzed in this chapter are all " technical " paintings , in i lockmey 's sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three artists have used to deal with this subject matter is to // break certain selected rules of depiction that had previously been taken for granted as self-evidently " true " or " natural , " at least by the standards of Western realistic painting . Far and away the commonest function of painting , prior to the twentieth century , had been to represent the object domain : the domain made up of objects like people and tables , whether real or imagined . When a symbol system is used to give an account of the object domain it is known as an object language . Just as the sentence " The grass is green " tells us something about the color of grass , so a portrait or a landscape can tell us something about the shapes and colors of objects in the scene . In these examples , English and painting are employed as object languages . However , a symbol system can also be used to comment on or investigate other symbol systems , and a symbol system employed for this purpose is described as a metalanguage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metalinguistic essay : its subject matter is not objects ? although of course paintings and drawings are objects ? but painting and drawing as symbol systems . Object languages and metalanguages differ in their functions , rather than in the sets of symbols they happen to use . Very often the symbols used in object languages differ from the symbols used in metalanguages . For example , in this book I am using English as a metalanguage to comment on systems like Pointillism and perspective that are not , in themselves , parts of English ? although their names are parts of English . However , it can happen that the symbols used in a metalanguage are the same as the symbols used in the object language on which it is commenting ; and then , unless certain precautions are taken , things can get very confusing . For example , " Chicago is a populous city " is simply a sentence in an object language : it tells us something about Chicago , and there is little danger of confusion . The sentence " Das Gras ist gran is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metalanguage ? it tells us something about German as a symbol system ? but again there is not too much likelihood of confusion , partly because the words " Das , " " Gras , " " ist , " and " gran " are not words in English , and partly because I have used the normal convention of italicizing words in a foreign language . The sentences " Chicago is trisyllabic " and " The grass is green is a grammatical sentence in English " could be confusing , however , because they mix English used as a metalanguage and English used as an object language . The normal precaution taken against this confusion is to separate the two by using single quotation marks , thus : " ' Chicago ' is trisyllabic " and " ' The grass is green ' is a grammatical sentence in English . " Alternatively , I can avoid using two sets of quotation marks by saying : // 1 . " Chicago " is trisyllabic. 2 . " The grass is green " is a grammatical sentence in English . Sentence 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The grass is green , " which is a fragment of English used as an object language . I say appears to contain because it does not actually contain this sentence , but rather the name of the sentence ? which happens , in this case , to be identical in its form to the sentence to which it refers . Just as normal English sentences can not literally contain objects such as grass , so metalinguistic sentences can not literally contain parts of an object language , but only their names ( Nagel and Newman , 1964 ) . Even with the help of conventions like the use of single quotation marks , however , distinguishing between object languages and metalanguages can be difficult , and using symbol systems as metalanguages rather than as object languages can sometimes seem both obscure and perverse : " You are sad , " said the Knight in an anxious tone : " let me sing you a song to comfort you .... The name of the song is called Haddocks ' Eyes . " ' " Oh , that 's the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to feel interested . " No , you do n't understand , " the Knight said , looking a little vexed . " That 's what the name is called . The name really is The Aged Aged Man . " ' " Then I ought to have said That 's what the song is called ' ? " Alice corrected herself . " No , you ought n't : that 's quite another thing ! The song is called Ways and Means ' : but that 's only what it 's called , you know ! " " Well , what is the song then ? " said Alice , who was by this time completely bewildered . " I was coming to that , " the Knight said . " The song really is A-sitting on A Gate ' : and the tune 's my own invention . " ( Carroll , 1962 , pp. 184 , 185 ) It is easy to understand Alice 's bewilderment . But in fact , metalanguages can serve important functions , and their employment within mathematics , verbal language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . The attempt to discover , in the nineteenth century , whether ordinary Euclidean geometry was consistent , and the discovery of new geometries such as Riemannian geometry , raised crucial questions about which of these geometries , if any , best described the real world ( Nagel and Newman , 1964 ) . This led to the study of formal structures within mathematics , and then to the use of metamathematics to describe these structures : it is no coincidence that Lewis Carroll , the author of the Alice books , was a mathematician . Similarly , the investigation of archaic written languages , the rediscovery of Sanskrit , and attempts to describe and ... . l the American Indian languages before they became extinct , led at the // beginning of the twentieth century to the establishment of linguistics as an autonomous discipline : the use of language as a metalanguage , in order to study language itself . It is probably not possible to point to any one moment at which painters first began to use painting to comment on the nature of depiction . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other periods and cultures forced painters to compare pictures based on very different drawing and denotation systems . Japanese woodblock color prints , for example , became widely popular in France from the early 1860s , and their lack of tonal modeling and use of pure color offered a particularly intriguing alternative to the conventions of European painting and the use of chiaroscuro . In addition , the invention of photography in the nineteenth century confronted painters with a mode of depiction which shared some features with contemporary painting ? the use of perspective , and a tonal system derived from the play of light ? but which in other ways was very different . The impact of such alternative forms of depiction naturally raised questions in artists ' minds about Gombrich 's " riddle of style " : " Why is it that different ages and different nations have represented the visible world in such different ways ? " ( Gombrich , 1960/ 1988 , p. 3 ) . Two nineteenth-century discoveries seemed relevant to this question , but unfortunately they pointed in different directions . The first was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed at the time to guarantee its truth : what Fox Talbot called " the pencil of nature " must , it seemed , be more truthful than even the best of painting because it appeared to be free of subjective human interference . ' And of course , capturing the light from the scene directly by photography fitted in perfectly with accounts of painting and visual perception that were based exclusively on physical optics . Thus the superiority of Western art , already established on cultural grounds , seemed to be confirmed by nature itself . The paintings of other cultures were simply stages in the evolution of photographic realism . The discovery of photography was announced in 1839 ( Scharf , 1979 ) . But only a very few years later Hermann von Helmholtz , perhaps the greatest single figure in the experimental study of vision , suggested that what we actually experience in vision is not a series of single , static , photographlike retinal images . In his Physiological Optics he attempted to describe what happened beyond the retina in terms of the formation of what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories , like the discovery of-photography , also had a profound influence on painting . ' Teuber ( 1981 ) ) has argued that it was Helmholtz 's writings that promoted Cezanne'c // famous advice to " treat nature in terms of the cylinder , the cone , and the sphere . " It was Helmholtz who had shown in the third part of the Physiological Optics ( French translation , 1867 ) that we see in each illusionistic or perspective transformation of an object more than the retinal image , that we " add to it , " as his followers put it ( nous ajoutons ) the basic form or idea of the object . We see in all perspective renderings and even in the confusing shapes of nature the constant , non-illusionistic forms of cylinder , cube and sphere . Helmholtz elaborated on this in L'Optique et la Peinture which was included in the highly popular Principes Scicntifques des Beaux-Arts of 1878 ( with three more editions to follow ) . In Les Peintres Cubistes ( 1913 ) Apollinaire distinguished in a similar manner between la realite de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connaissance . And he went on : " All men have a sense of this interior reality . A man does not have to be cultivated to conceive of a round form , for instance . The geometrical aspect , which made such an impression on those who saw the first canvases of the scientific cubists , came from the fact that the essential form was rendered with great purity , while visual accident and anecdotes had been eliminated . " ( Teuber , 1980 , pp. 3 ? 4 ) So just at the moment when it at last became possible to produce pictures that appeared to provide a perfect record of the light from a scene , the validity of such a record in relation to our actual experience of the visual world was being questioned . Thus at the end of the nineteenth century painters were confronted with a number of circumstances that challenged current ideas about painting : the increasing availability of pictures from other periods and cultures , the discovery of photography , and the beginning of new theories of vision . These influences inevitably made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised profound questions about the very nature of painting . In the early twentieth century this led many painters to turn away from painting as a way of depicting objects in the scene , and instead to begin to use their paintings as metapictures , as a way of investigating the nature of depiction itself . The scientific study of picture languages , and with it the use of pictures as metapictures , began in the 1960s within artificial intelligence . Many of these studies were greatly influenced by Noam Chomsky 's account of generative grammar ( Chomsky , 1957/1972 , 1965/1972 ) , then at the height of its popularity . The main problem in analyzing pictures was seen to be the problem of finding " descriptive schemata " for pictures : explicit ways of describing the elements ? lines , dots , blobs , and so on ? of which a picture is composed , and the relationships between them : in other words , finding ways // of describing what I have called the drawing systems and denotation systems . Kirsh showed that this problem was closely analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like English and proposed that the same technical means , namely a generative grammar , be adopted to solve it . Among attempts at putative " picture grammars " some have utilised a two-dimensional format for the grammatical rules thus making the syntax of the meta language mirror that of the object language ? as it does in the traditional corpus of generative grammar . ( Clowes , 1971 , p. 81 ) This is , so far as I know , the first reference to the possibility of using pictures to serve a metalinguistic function . By analogy , I shall refer to pictures used in this way as " metapictures . " As I emphasized in Chapter 1 , one of the most important outcomes of these studies was the realization that it was necessary to make a careful distinction between words that describe picture primitives such as lines and regions , and words like edges and surfaces that describe corresponding scene primitives . In verbal language the problem of distinguishing between a word and its referent is not nearly so urgent : we are never likely to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually contains the city itself . But pictures are often so persuasive that it is all too tempting to describe them , as we often do in everyday language , as containing features like edges and surfaces , or objects like tables and people . What they actually contain , of course , is lines of ink or patches of paint . Once we forget this distinction , and begin to think that pictures actually contain objects , it becomes impossible to talk about them in any useful way . Because of this danger of confusing the picture domain with the object domain , frames serve a crucially important function in depiction : a function somewhat similar to that performed by quotation marks . In written English , quotation marks are used to separate direct speech or writing from the rest of the sentence : that is , to mark the boundary between the text and the words quoted , which come from a different domain : another written text , or the domain of the real world if we are quoting the words spoken by a real person , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , because we are not usually in any danger of confusing a written text with a real or imagined world , ' there is no need to put the whole of a novel within quotation marks . But with pictures there can be such a danger ; so many pictures , at least iii the Western tradition , are enclosed by a frame , just as in a traditional Western theater the audience is separated from the stage by a proscenium arch . ' In fart , the one crucial defining feature of Western // pictures is that they should have a frame . As Clowes put it , in the context of artificial intelligence : " Minimally a picture consists of a single region whose outer closure is a frame " ( Clowes , 1971 , p. 94 ) . Because frames play such a crucial role in marking the boundary between the picture domain and the object domain , it is possible to question the nature of depiction by employing anomalous relations between the frame and the picture : for example , by falsely attaching features of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture to leak out past the frame into the object domain , or by allowing features of the object domain to pass the frame into the picture domain , as in the typically Cubist device of using pieces of real wallpaper or newspaper as part of the picture . Moreover , pictures used as metapictures very often employ two frames , very much as sentences used for metalinguistic purposes employ two sets of quotation marks . ' Magritte 's famous painting This Is Not a Pipe ( Ceti n'est pas une pipe ) would be more or less trivial as an object painting of a pipe ; what Magritte was doing was drawing attention to the fact that this painting , in spite of its realism , is not a pipe but a picture of a pipe . In a later version , The Air and the Song ( L'air et la chanson , 1964 ) , he made the same point more explicitly . The picture itself is not merely a picture , but a picture of a picture : in this case , a picture of a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained within an elaborate frame , confirming its status as a picture ; but to confound matters , the smoke from the pipe drifts out past the frame into the domain of the picture that contains this picture as a representation . Yet another version , The Two Mysteries ( Les deux mysteres , 1966 ) ( fig. 12.1 ) depicts both a pipe and a picture of a pipes Of course , many paintings contain representations of pictures as part of the depicted scene , but here Magritte seems to be quoting his earlier painting : the frame within The Two Mysteries acts like the second set of quotation marks within a metalinguistic statement . The paintings analyzed below illustrate three different styles of metalinguistic investigation . Gris 's Breakfast , 1914 , is highly complex , and employs a number of different anomalous pictorial devices . These include the reversal of the normal rules of occlusion ; the extensive use of false attachment both within the picture and between the picture and the frame ; and the importation of both parts of the real world , and a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . All these devices , with the exception of the false attachments or near false attachments between features of the picture and the frame , were used by Picasso and Braque , and it could be argued that Gris 's Breakfast is not a metapicture at all : perhaps ( Iris was simply displaying or experimenting with different pictorial devices . In contrast , Klee 's Oh , but Oh ! ( Ach , aber ach , 1937 ) could almost come from a paper on picture // languages in the field of artificial intelligence : it consists of a concise essay on one very simple proposition , that lines can stand for many different kinds of features in the real world . Finally , Hockney 's Play within a Play , 1963 , takes the possibility of using painting as a way of making statements about painting for granted . There are no anomalies within the painting ; like Magritte 's The Two Mysteries , it contains a picture within a picture , and only the relation between the picture and the domain of the viewer is anomalous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " art and life , " as Hockney himself put it . Juan Gris , Breakfast , 1914 The structure of ( ; ris 's Breakfast ( color plate 6 ) is based on the contrast between the use of a ( fairly ) straightforward drawing system and a number of ' cotnple ? x and anomalous denotation systems ( Willats , 1983 ) . A tracing ( fir 12 231 di iwa tlut thr LINO is // variety of vertical oblique projection with the object shown in a foreshortened position ) , while the cups , the wineglass , the egg cup , part of a bottle , and the coffeepot are all drawn in vertical oblique projection . The cups and the glass look rather elongated , but analysis ( fig. 2.11 ) shows that the cups are perfectly ordinary ones , and that their elongated appearance is a result of using this particular drawing system . Thus in terms of projective geometry the picture can be regarded as showing a view of a breakfast table from above , and from a considerable distance , with the table turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way this drawing system is used here , however , is that the vertical axes of the bottle and the coffeepot are aligned with the side edges of the table , while the axes of the egg cup and part of a cup in the middle of the picture are tilted in the opposite direction . In addition , the spout of the coffeepot and part of the front edge of the table are displaced . The straightforward nature of this view is , moreover , somewhat disguised by the more or less abstract rectangular forms imposed on the picture surface ( fig. 12.2b ) . These forms fan out from the lower half of the picture rather like a hand of cards , giving an effect of inverted perspective that tends to disguise the underlying system of vertical oblique projection . The basic denotation system of this picture is that of a line drawing with shading . The shading is used for two main purposes : to show the shapes of rounded objects through the representation of tonal modeling , and to bring edges or surfaces forward relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their simplest form in the bottle at the top of the picture . The right-hand contour of the bottle is shaded on its inner side , with the tone fading away toward the interior of the form ( fig. 12.2b ) . This gives an effect of tonal modeling , and shows how the surface turns away from the spectator at the edge of the form . On the left-hand side of the bottle , however , the contour is shaded on its outer side , and this serves the purpose of bringing the bottle foward relative to the background . Similar effects can be seen along the contours of the coffeepot . The rounded forms of the table legs are shown using tonal modeling on both sides , while the flat surfaces of the table top and the frame of the table are brought forward by shading outside the contour . The shading on the cups and saucers is more closely related to the play of light : the tonal modeling is more elaborate , and there is some suggestion of highlights and cast shadow . Thus although Gris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the picture to another , it is fairly orthodox ; more so than it is in a number of his other paintings and drawings carried out at this period . Apart front some dislocation of the forms , then , Gris 's representation of ' shape in Breakfast , both in his drawing and his use of tone , is fairly conven278 FUNCTIONS OF REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS tional . His use of axonometric projection is similar to that used in contemporary architectural drawings ; and apart from the use of shading to bring objects forward relative to the background , the tonal system in Breakfast is similar to that used in the engineering drawing shown in fig. 6.3 . The main anomaly in this painting is the way in which the normal rules for the representation of occlusion are reversed . In some places those parts of the scene that would normally be hidden , such as the far edge of the table where it would be hidden by the coffeepot , are included in the painting . In fig. 12.2c this edge is identified by a zigzag line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen in the painting , such as parts of the coffeepot , the wineglass , and the lowest cup , are left out . In fig. 12.2c these are shown using dotted lines . As Koenderink ( 1990 ) said , " occlusion is by far the most powerful depth cue that you can draw on " ( p. 615 ) , and reversing the normal rules for representing occlusion flattens the picture almost completely , in spite of the presence of a number of other powerful depth cues . In addition , there are numerous instances of the use of false attachment , both within the picture and between objects depicted in the picture and the frame . Within the picture , these include false attachments between the rim of the right-hand cup and the edge of the table ; between the rim of the lowest cup , and its saucer , and the edge of the tablecloth ; and between the edge of the coffeepot , the far edge of the table , and the abstract rectangular form which occupies the middle of the painting . In fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , there appear to be false attachments or near false attachments between the right-hand corner of the table and the frame , and between the abstract rectangle at the top of the picture and the frame ; these are shown in fig. 12.2c by double asterisks . Finally , there is a false attachment or near false attachment between the frame and the spout of the coffeepot . There are three other types of anomaly in the picture . Most of the picture is in dull browns , grays , and blues , all of which are recessive colors ; but the parcel and the coffeepot lid are in red . This reverses the normal rule of atmospheric perspective , that the warmest colors should appear in the foreground ( fig. 12.2d ) . Second , some of the regions in the painting are not painted , but are made up of real woodgrain paper , real wallpaper , and part of a real newspaper , so that these surfaces represent themselves , instead of being depicted . Finally , by using a newspaper , 1. e Journial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol system verbal language ? into the domain of the picture . Even this anomaly is given an additional twist : Gris used this fragment of newspaper to sign his name  --  Jaun ( OURN ) Gris. // What was Gris 's purpose in introducing these anomalies into what would be , otherwise , a fairly straightforward picture ? According to Cooper and Tinterow ( 1983 ) , " Gris 's fundamental pictorial aim was to represent a three-dimensional experience of reality in two-dimensional terms on the surface of the canvas without recourse to illusion " ( p. 136 ) . To the extent that this aim is satisfied in a normal engineering drawing showing a pictorial view , Gris could have achieved that aim simply by combining a line drawing in axonometric projection with a conventional system of shading . The anomalies in the picture ? the reversal of the normal rules for the representation of occlusion , and so on ? destroy any possible illusion , but they do not add to the spectator 's experience of three-dimensional reality . The most obvious effect these anomalies have is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture : that is , as an artificial symbol system rather than a slice of real life . When confronted with pictures that are realistic in a photographic way , such as TV pictures , we tend to pay attention to the depicted scene rather than the picture itself we look through the picture , rather than at it . With Gris 's Breakfast the anomalies in the painting make this impossible : we have to pay attention not only to what the artist is saying , but how he is saying it . But in addition , anomaly provides a method of exploring the ways in which symbol systems work ? a method that has now become standard practice in psychology . Chomsky used this method in his explorations of linguistic structures , and the same approach was adopted by Clowes and Huffman in their investigation of pictorial structures . As Clowes said , " There are three main vehicles which Chomsky deploys to expose our intuitions : paraphrase , anomaly and ambiguity " ( 1971 , p. 80 ) . The difference is that whereas Chomsky , Clowes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was looking for a pictorial language . Gris said , " Cezanne turns a bottle into a cylinder , but I begin with a cylinder and create an individual of a special type : I made a bottle ? a particular bottle ? out of a cylinder . " Whereas Cezanne started from observation , Gris started from theory : " The mathematics of picture-making lead me to the physics of representation " ( Kahnweiler , 1969 , p. 139 ) . With hindsight it is tempting , though perhaps unjustified , to see Gris , the most intellectual and scientific of the Cubist painters , as the first painter to use painting as a metalanguage . No doubt , like the other Cubists , he used anomaly for compositional ends : destroying illusion and flattening the picture surface . But the way in which Gris deploys these anomalies itt his painting seems so deliberate and so controlled that it is difficult to avoid feeling that he is , at least in this painting , using painting as a metalanguage in order to explore the nature of painting , itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Oh ! but oh ! ) , 1937 In Gris 's Breakfast the anomalies are extremely complex . In contrast , Oh ! but oh ! ( fig. 12.3a ) is a simple , elegant essay on the uses of line . The painting deftly combines two different kinds of anomaly . In previous chapters I have described two different kinds of denotation system , both using lines as picture primitives . The first is very familiar : it forms the basis for most adult drawing from both East and West , including Japanese prints , line drawings by Western draftsmen from Mantegna to Picasso , Disneylike cartoons , and engineering drawings . This is the denotation sytem analyzed by Clowes and Huffman . In it , lines can stand for edges , contours , thin , wirelike forms , and cracks . Children , however , produce line drawings based on a quite different denotation system , one in which the one-dimensional lines stand for volumes or surfaces . In the tadpole drawing by a 5-year-old boy shown in // figs. 1.12 and 4.5 , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the legs as whole volumes , while the single line used to represent the nose appears to stand for the nose as either a volume or a ridge , that is , as a convex surface . In Klee 's Oh ! but oh ! these two kinds of denotation systems are combined . Not only does the principal line in the picture change its reference along its length , but the denotation systems to which the line belongs also change . Klee 's picture thus violates the two rules on which an adult line drawing is normally based : that lines normally stand for one-dimensional shape features such as edges and contours , and that a single line segment can not have more than one meaning at different points along its length . In the previous chapter , I showed how Klee violated the second of these two rules in Naked on the Bed in order to obtain an expressive effect , but in that painting the line stands for just one kind of shape feature : the contour of a smooth form . In Oh ! but oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture changes the nature of its reference no less than five times along its length ( fig. 12.3b ) . Beginning at the bottom right , the line starts by standing for the edge of a bow tie , with the surface of the tie to the right of the line . Then the reference of the line changes so that the surface of the other half of the tie lies to the left of the line . Continuing upwards , the line changes its reference again and becomes the contour of the head and cheek . At the top of the picture there is another change where the line stands for one of the eyebrows , an area of darker local tone on the surface of the head . Continuing down , the line now stands for the nose , either as a volume or as a ridge . Finally , between the nose and the mouth , it denotes the convex furrow in the middle of the upper lip . Thus along its length one single line is used to stand for five different kinds of shape features : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furrow . Klee does not seem to have any particular expressive intentions here . Apart from its playful title , this painting is probably about as close as one could come in painting to a scientific treatise , in the manner of Clowes and Huffinan , on line reference . David Hockney , Play within a Play , 1963 One thing that conies over very clearly from both his paintings and his autobiography ( Hockney , 1976 ) is Hockney 's preoccupation with style . Hockney 's way of dealing with the problems raised by the existence ofmany different kinds of style in painting was to take style itself ' , rather than the // world of objects , as his subject matter . From what Hockney says himself , it is clear that he was very conscious of the formal devices that he used in Play within a Play ( color plate 7 ) . Immediately after The Hypnotist I painted Still Life with Figure and Curtain , which was done in a very formal way . Soon after I began it , I went in the National Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought I knew the National Gallery and all the pictures very well , but in 1963 they 'd bought a group of paintings by the seventeenth-century artist Domenichino . I wandered in and found them in a room and they thrilled me , because they were things I could use . I suddenly saw what they were about . The moment these pictures revealed themselves , I realized my ideas were far from being new . It was n't their subject matter from Greek mythology which interested me , but the fact that they really seemed like trompe-l'oeil painting . They were paintings made to look like tapestries made from paintings , already a double level of reality . All of them had borders round and tassels hanging at the bottom and perhaps an inch of floor showing , making the illusionistic depth of the picture one inch . In one of them , Apollo Killing Cyclops fig. 12.4a1 , the tapestry was folded back a little , like the illusionistic device on a Kodak film box , and in front of this was a dwarf . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be about but the doubling back from the spectator interested me . Play within a Play is my version of Apollo Killing Cyclops . Instead of calling it " Picture within a Picture within a Picture , " I thought I 'd use the common literary version of it : Play within a Play . It uses Domenichino 's idea of a very shallow space with a picture on a tapestry that has illusion and you do n't know whether the illusion is real or not , because it has this border round it . You 're playing so many games , and they are visual . The tapestry is invented , using images from previous work . The figure is a portrait of John Kasmin fig. 12.4b . Kas had always wanted me to paint him but I 'd never got round to it as I could n't really decide how to do it . Now it seemed appropriate to trap him in this small space between art and life ( the sheet of glass is real , and where his hands or clothes touch they are painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1976 , p. 90 ) Both Gris 's Breakfast and Klee 's Oh ! but oh ! use anomaly as a way of exploring pictorial structures . Hockney 's Play within a Play exploits a major anomaly , but it also uses transcription : a technique closely related to paraphrase , one of Chomsky 's other ways of " exposing our intuitions . " Like other metalinguistic techniques , transcription originally developed quite naturally in response to straightforward needs . Before the invention of photography , many pictures were copied by artists in order to provide patrons with a version of a picture that they admired but could not buy . Copying also provided an excellent way for artists to learn technique : the act of copying forces the copyist to study , and learn Irons , the techniques of another artists . Inevitably , the style of such copies differed to a greater or // lesser extent from that of the original . In Rembrandt 's copies of Persian miniature paintings , for example , the style is much closer to Rembrandt 's normal style than it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be regarded as transcriptions rather than copies . Toward the end of the nineteenth century , many artists began to make transcriptions as a conscious way of exploring style . One great advantage of transcription , from the artist 's point of view , is that it allows him or her to explore pictorial structures without worrying too much about the subject matter . Paradoxically , this has led many modern artists to draw their themes from the past . As Steiner put it : The history of Picasso is marked by retrospection . The explicit variations on classical pastoral themes , the citations from and pastiches of Rembrandt , Goya , Velazquez , Manet , are external products of a constant revision , a " seeing again " in the light of technical and cultural shifts . Had we only Picasso 's sculptures , graphics , and paintings , we could reconstruct a fair portion of the development of the arts from the Minoan to Cezanne .... The apparent iconoclasts have turned out to be more or less anguished custodians racing through the museum of civiliza seeking order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In model instil cool , to has been the representative device . I he new , even at its most scandalous , has been set against an informing background and framework of tradition . Stravinsky , Picasso , Braque , Eliot , Joyce , Pound ? the " makers of the new " ? have been neo-classics , often as observant of canonic precedent as their seventeenth century forebears . ( Steiner , 1977 , pp. 465 ? 466 ) Hockney 's Play within a Play is a collage of transcriptions taken from at least three sources . The primary source was , as Hockney says , Domenichino 's Apollo Killing the Cyclops ( fig. 12.4a ) . What Hockney has taken from this picture , however , is not so much its composition as its formal structure . Like Magritte 's The Two Mysteries , it questions the nature of pictures as symbol systems by showing two different levels of reality : the dwarf in the foreground is on a different plane of reality than the scene from the Greek myth being enacted behind . Like the picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enclosed within a frame , which in this case is also the border of a tapestry . The second source from which Play within a Play is taken was a photograph of the artist 's dealer , John Kasmin ( fig. 12.4b ) , who is seen pressing his face and hands against a sheet of glass . Finally , a third source is one of Hockney 's own paintings , The Hypnotist , also painted in 1963 . The Hypnotist shows two figures on a stage flanked by curtains : a rather evil-looking hypnotist and a helpless boy . This picture is itself a transcription : the source was a scene in a movie called The Raven where Vincent Price and Peter Lorre are magicians trying to impress each other with their magic . The two figures in the tapestry in Play within a Play are reminiscent of the two figures in The Hypnotist . Play within a Play thus exploits two classic metalinguistic techniques : transcription and the representation of multiple levels of reality . In addition , it contains one major anomaly . Like the frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and the other formal . The glass protects the picture from damage and at the same time marks the boundary between the picture domain and the object domain . If , in a Renaissance painting , the frame represents the frame of a window , then the glass represents the window glass , separating the domain of the picture from the domain of the real world . ' Hockney makes this function explicit by allowing his figure to press his face and hands against the glass . This device can be thought of as a very special form of false attachment , like the false attachments between objects in the picture and the frame in Gris 's Breakfast . In terms of technique , subject matter , and surface composition , Magritte 's The Two Mysteries , Gris 's Breakfast , Klee 's Oh ! , but oh ! , and Hockney 's Play within a Play have almost nothing in common . What links them is that these are not object pictures , but metapictures . CHAPTER THIRTEEN Children 's Drawing Development Studies of children 's drawing development go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricci 's L'arte dei bambini ( 1887 ) is usua as the first work on children 's drawings , and it was followed a year Bernard Perez 's L'art et la poesie chez 1'enfant ( 1888 ) . James Sully 's Childhood ( 1895 ) contained a comprehensive account of children 's development , and this provided a basis for subsequent studies such of Kerschensteiner ( 1905 ) and Luquet ( 1913 , 1927 ) . The literal children 's drawing development within the field of developmental 1 ogy is now very extensive . However , because most of these studies have been carried out b opmental psychologists , most writers have been concerned with g account of the mental processes underlying children 's drawings , and these processes change as children get older . The problem with this a is that these processes can not be observed directly but can only be from the drawings that children actually produce ; and in default accurate , comprehensive formal scheme for describing the representative systems in children 's drawings , the validity of any such inferenc remain doubtful . I shall therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified in terms of the drawing and de systems I have described in previous chapters , and how their c change with increasing age , and only then turn to the question of I why these changes take place . What alternative classification schemes are currently available ? T widely known and , until recently , most generally accepted th // children 's drawing development has been Luquet 's theory of intellectual and visual realism . This theory is usually summed up by saying that young children draw what they know and older children draw what they see . The change from intellectual to visual realism is supposed to occur between the ages of about 7 to 9 years . Luquet 's account of drawing development ( Freeman , 1972 ) was actually more complex than this , but the idea that young children draw things as they are known to be , rather than as they appear from a particular point of view , goes back at least as far as Clark ( 1897 ) . A number of writers , myself among them , have suggested that Luquet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of Marr 's distinction between object-centered and viewer-centered internal descriptions . That is , children 's early drawings might be derived from internal object-centered descriptions , while drawings by older children might be derived from viewer-centered descriptions ( Cox , 1985 ; Crook , 1985 ; Freeman , 1987 ; Light , 1985 ; Nicholls and Kennedy , 1992 ; . Willats , 1981 , 1987 ) . Luquet 's account of drawing development does not in itself provide a formal scheme for classifying children 's drawings : " what children know " and " what children see " are ways of describing mental states , not ways of describing the drawings themselves . However , Luquet 's stage of intellectual realism is usually associated with certain characteristic features of children 's drawings , especially the so-called " transparencies , " the use of multiple viewpoints , and the " examplarity " of shapes , in which each detail is drawn as clearly as possible , regardless of considerations of perspective ( Freeman , 1972 ) . Thus Phillips et al . ( 1978 ) associated fold-out drawings of cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of intellectual realism , and drawings approximating to oblique projections or perspective with visual realism . Piaget endorsed Luquet 's theory of intellectual and visual realism , but grafted it onto his own account of child development , and in particular his account of the development of the child 's conception of space ( Piaget and Inhelder , 1956 ) . Piaget was influenced by Jules-Henri Poincare 's account of invariant geometry , in which different kinds of spatial relations remain invariant over transformations from one coordinate system to another . The geometries governing such transformations form a hierarchy arranged in the following order , in which each geometry is a special case of the one above it : 1 . Topology 2 . Projective geometry ( corresponding to perspective ) 3 . Affine geometry ( corresponding to oblique projection ) 4 . Euclidian-metrical geometry ( corresponding to orthogonal projection ) . // In topological transformations , only the most general spatial relations remain invariant over transformations : relations such as spatial order , connectivity , and enclosure . In projective transformations , lines remain straight , but regions do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property of " being parallel " remains invariant . Finally , in Euclidean-metrical transformations , the most special properties such as the true shapes of regions are preserved . Piaget and Inhelder suggested that this hierarchy could provide a framework for an account of the development of the child 's conception of space and , consequently , the development of drawing ability , and this led them to identify Luquet 's period of intellectual realism with the use of topological geometry . According to this account , the reason for the appearance of so-called transparencies in children 's drawings during this stage , like the transparency drawings described by Clark ( 1897 ) ' and the drawing of Father Christmas coming down the chimney shown in fig. 3.4 , is that children are representing the topological property of enclosure , rather than representing perspectival views . This suggestion is , I think , correct . However , the developmental sequence observed in children 's drawings of rectangular objects such as tables and cubes does not support the developmental sequence predicted by Piaget 's account based on invariant geometry . Piaget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sequence ought to be : perspective , oblique projection , and finally orthogonal projection . In fact , the actual sequence , observed in numerous experiments , is just the reverse of this . For example , the developmental sequence observed in the experiment ( Willats , 1977a ) in which children were asked to draw a table from a fixed viewpoint was : orthogonal projection , vertical oblique projection , oblique projection , and , finally , some form of perspective ( fig. 13.1 ) . Thus Piaget 's account represents an advance on Luquet 's in that it identifies a number of different drawing systems with different developmental stages , and is also important because it identifies the earliest stage of development with the use of transformations based on topological geometry . However , the sequence it predicts thereafter is incorrect . ' Hagen 's account of the projection systems was given exclusively in terms of primary geometry and the projection of light ( Hagen , 1985 , 1986 ) . Her scheme consists , effectively , of the same classes of transformation systems as Piaget 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection , and metric projection . However , because she based her account exclusively on primary geometry , she regarded all these systems as being of equal status , rather than as firming a hierarchy of geometries . Her account thus predicts that there is no developmental sequence in children 's drawing abilities . Again , this prediction is not supported by the evidence . ' // There are very few accounts of the development of what I have called the notation systems in the literature on children 's drawings . ' Luquet 's stage visual realism is often associated with " photographic " realism : Biihler ) 49 ) fulminated against young children 's outline drawings which he called n abortion " ( p. 114 ) and equated " the realistic picture " with " a photoiph " ( p. 119 ) . Freeman and Janikoun ( 1972 ) contrasted Luquet 's stage of : ellectual realism in which the child draws from an " internal model " with later stage of visual realism in which the child attempts to " reproduce visually available stimulus configuration " ( p. 1116 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " visually available stimulus configuration " if is is taken to mean either the light falling on the retina or the retinal image elf . Nor do children normally draw anything like photographically realispictures ( that is , they do not use an optical denotation system ) until well yond the ages of 7 to 9 when the change from intellectual realism to visual dism is supposed to take place . Although the vast majority of marks in children 's drawings are lines , I ve argued in earlier chapters that it is crucial to distinguish between marks ie actual physical traces made by the drawing instrument ) and picture mitives . Describing children 's drawings in terms of the picture primitives which they are based provides a classification scheme for the denotation items in children 's drawings consisting of three classes : 1 . Regions as picture primitives 2 . Lines as picture primitives 3 . Line junctions as picture primitives Have set the classes out in this way in order to emphasize their differences . cause children use lines as marks from the very beginning of drawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developmental sequence in their use denotation systems . I shall argue , on the contrary , that the use of different notation systems by children of different ages is at least as important , if not ) re important , than their use of different drawing systems . Thus I shall begin this chapter by describing the results of three experiments in terms of the drawing and denotation systems I have deibed in previous chapters . In previous chapters I have discussed a number drawings by children , but the analyses I have given have not been set thin a developmental context . In this chapter I want to emphasize the - relations between the formal hierarchies of classes within the drawing ini denotation systems defined in terms of secondary geometry , and the Ier of the appearance of these classes in the development of ' children 's wings . The drawing systems can 1 ) c arranged in the following order in // terms of the complexity of the rules of secondary geometry on which they are based : Drawing systems 1 . Topology and extendedness 2 . Orthogonal projection 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Perspective Denotation systems 1 . Regions as picture primitives 2 . Lines as picture primitives 3 . Line junctions as picture primitives In terms of picture production , drawing systems based on topology deal only with the simplest and most basic spatial relations , and only the simplest and most basic shape properties can be described in terms of extendedness and shape modifiers . At the other end of the scale , the rules of secondary geometry governing representations in perspective are quite complex . Similarly , denotation systems based on regions as picture primitives can only enter into the simplest topological relations , while at the other end of this scale the rules governing the ways in which line junctions may and may not be connected so as to provide possible views ( as described in Chapter 5 ) are again quite complex . In this chapter I shall show that there is a correlation between these orders of complexity and the developmental sequence . Children 's Drawings of Tables Fig. 13.1 repeats the results of the experiment to which I referred in Chapter 1 in which 108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table , with various objects on it , from a fixed viewpoint ( Willats , 1977a ) . The view which the children had of the table is shown in fig. 13.1a . The drawings of tables that the children produced were assigned to six classes , typical examples of which are shown in figs. b to g . These classes were defined in terms of five projection systems , and the results showed that there was a highly significant correlation between class membership and the mean age // of children in each class . ' These mean ages were as follows : no projection system , 7.4 years ; orthogonal projection , 9.7 years ; vertical oblique projection , 11.9 years ; oblique projection , 1 3.6 years ; naive perspective , 14.3 years ; perspective , 13.7 years . The projection systems were defined in terms of two measures : the convergence of the orthogonals and the obliquity of the orthogonals . The angles between the orthogonals and the line representing the front edge of the table were measured for each drawing , as shown in figs. e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convergence and obliquity were then calculated from these angles . The angle of convergence was defined as the derence between these two angles , and the angle of obliquity as the mean of the two angles . For example , the angle of convergence for the drawing shown in fig. e was 20 ? and the angle of obliquity was 56 ? , and the drawing was assigned to the class of oblique projections . ' The angle of convergence for the drawing shown in fig. g was 80 ? and the angle of obliquity was 80 ? , so this drawing was judged to be in perspective . Drawings with no orthogonals , like the drawing shown in fig. c , were judged to be in orthogonal projection . A few of the youngest children produced drawings in which the depictions of the objects on the table were scattered across the page , or else arranged in a way that was roughly correct in terms of their spatial order but without their being connected . These drawings were assigned to class 1 , no projection system . The drawings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of points of occlusion ( or " overlap " as this was called in my original paper ) . In fig. 13.1 these points are marked with asterisks . The drawing shown in fig. e , for example , contains three such points compared with the six points of occlusion in the drawing shown in fig. a , and the overlap score for this drawing was thus 0.5 . There was a highly significant correlation between the mean overlap score for each age group ( from 6 to 17 years ) and the mean group age . ' At the time that I reported this experiment I had not yet developed the concept of the denotation systems : thus the drawing systems were defined only in terms of the directions of the orthogonals , and the overlap scores were simply reported in terms of the child 's ability to represent " overlap , " as it was then called in the literature on children 's drawings . With hindsight , however , it is possible to see the overlap scores as a measure of the child 's developing ability to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , it is also possible to interpret the drawings by the younger children ism terms of the use of regions as picture primitives . There is no representation of occlusion ism the drawings shown in figs. b , c , // and d , and all the faces of the rectangular objects are drawn as true shapes . The only spatial relations represented in figs. c and d are touching and spatial order , while in fig. b objects are not even represented as touching . Moreover , fig. d includes a fold-out drawing of a box , which also suggests that this drawing is based on regions as picture primitives . Thus the results of this experiment show a highly significant correlation between the sequence of drawing systems defined in terms of the rules of secondary geometry and the developmental sequence defined in terms of chronological age . In addition , a consideration of the types of drawings in each class , together with the highly significant correlation between the overlap scores and the mean ages for each age group , suggests a correlation between the sequence of denotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now be quantified . Children 's Drawings of an Unfamiliar Rectangular Object It is sometimes suggested that children learn to draw by drawing " what they know " in the sense of being able to reproduce a known graphic stereotype for a familiar object . That is , when children draw a familiar object they may produce a drawing derived not from the object itself , but from an internal representation consisting of a formalized way of drawing that object . Such stereotypes might be developed from the child 's own early scribbles , in which he or she happened to see a fortuitous resemblance to a known object , as Luquet suggested in his account of what he called " fortuitous realism " ( Freeman , 1972 ) . Alternatively , a stereotype might be derived from drawings by adults or other children . Adults sometimes teach children how to draw a cube in the form of a Necker cube , for example ( Hayes , 1978 ) , and teenage children often copy drawings of figures such as Superman from comics ( Wilson and Wilson , 1977 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also shown that young children sometimes base their drawings of people on drawings by other children . Finally , Phillips et al . ( 1978 ) suggested that children might base their drawings of a familiar object such as a cube on what they called a " graphic motor schema . " It is possible that there exist motor programs for drawing which are self-contained in the sense that they do not refer to any visual representation , but which , when executed , produce a picture of something . In other words , knowing how to draw something may mean knowing what movements to make to produce a picture of it . Such a motor program we will call a graphic motor schema . ( Phillips et al. , 1978 , p. 29 ) After carrying out the experiment described above , it occurred to nee that it might he suggested that the results of this experiment could he explained by // saying that , as tables are familiar objects which children often draw , children of different ages might have different , stereotyped ways of drawing them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment ( Willats , 1981 , 1984 ) in which 170 English children aged 4 to 13 years were asked to draw an unfamiliar object consisting of a wooden cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner . It seemed unlikely that children would have a graphic stereotype for such an object , and I wanted to see whether these children could use the projection systems previously found in children 's drawings of tables in order to draw an object that they were unlikely to have seen or drawn before . It was soon clear that the children could use these drawing systems to draw an unfamiliar object . Fig. 13.2 shows typical drawings produced by these children arranged into six classes . Most ( though not all ) of the drawings in class 2 were drawings in orthogonal projection ( mean age 7.0 years ) , the drawings in class 4 were in vertical oblique projection ( mean age 10.0 years ) , while the drawings in class 6 were in oblique projection ( mean age 12.0 years ) . ( No distinction was made between drawings in oblique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small to allow this distinction to be reliable . ) Given in terms of the projection systems , the developmental sequence was thus : orthogonal projection , vertical oblique projection , and oblique projection . However , a puzzling feature of these results was the many anomalous drawings produced by the children , shown here in classes 1 , 3 , and 5 together with a few drawings of the type shown on the left in class 2 . These drawings accounted for about one-third of all the drawings produced by the children in this experiment . It was the need to account for drawings of this type that originally prompted me to develop the concept of the denotation systems . Nicholls and Kennedy ( 1992 ) found very similar types of drawings when they asked children and adults to draw cubes ( fig. 8.3 ) . Because some of the classes used by Nicholls and Kennedy to classify the children 's drawings in their experiment were somewhat different from those used here , the results of the two experiments can not be compared directly . However , the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing drawings of similar types , seem much the same in each case , suggesting that the children were applying the same kinds of drawing and denotation rules in order to draw this unfamiliar object as they would in drawing cubes . The main difference was that the children produced a higher proportion of anomalous drawings when drawing the unfamiliar object . Probably the reason for this difference was not only that the object was unfamiliar but also that its shape was more complex than that of- a cube , and it was , in // consequence , simply more difficult to draw , so that children were more likely to make mistakes . Because I was still in the process of developing the concept of denotation systems when this experiment was first carried out in 1981 , the classes to which the drawings were assigned were not so clearly defined as I would now like . However , they are quite clear enough to show the developmental sequence in the children 's employment of denotation systems . Fig. 13.3 shows an analysis of some of the drawings of this unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.3 showed two examples of types of drawings of cubes that they referred to as " enclosure " drawings : both caption // consisted of single roughly circular regions enclosed by a curved outline . Class 1 , fig. 13.2 , shows two types of drawings of the unfamiliar object , also involving curved lines , but these drawings appear to be based on two different denotation rules . The first type consists of a single region with a concavity in the outline , and it seems likely that this drawing is intended to represent the object as a round volume with a concavity : that is , the unfamiliar object was represented as " a lump with a dent in it . " The second type , shown on the right in class 1 , consisted of more than one round region , // and this suggests that in drawings of this type the regions were intended to represent individual faces of the object , rather than the volume of the object as a whole . If this is the case , these drawings may be regarded as examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in class 2 . The first of these , on the left in fig. 13.2 , also appears to represent the object as a lump with a dent , but the outline of the drawing is composed of straight lines apparently representing the shape property " having plane faces . " Drawings of this type can not be equated with views , because the individual line segments can not be related to views of edges . The second type of drawing corresponds to an orthogonal projection , and thus to a possible view , and it seems likely that the regions in this drawing represent the faces that can be seen in an orthogonal view of the object . These two interpretations are shown in fig. 13.3 , classes 2a and 2b . The drawings shown in class 3 , fig. 13.2 , correspond to Nicholls and Kennedy 's fold-out drawings of cubes ; or perhaps , in the case of the drawing on the right in class 3 , to what they call " dissection " drawings . In each case , the child has added extra rectangular regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clearly based on a denotation system in which regions are used to denote faces , and this interpretation is shown in fig. 13.3 , class 3 . Drawings of the type shown in class 4 , fig. 13.2 , correspond to vertical oblique projections , and their geometry corresponds to what Nicholls and Kennedy called two-squares drawings of cubes . Nicholls and Kennedy emphasized that they found only relatively small numbers of drawings of this type , and as solutions to the problem of drawing rectangular objects these drawings represent something of a dead end in the developmental sequence because they do not show objects from a sufficiently general direction of view , and , consequently , do not provide effective shape representations . However , drawings of this type do have the advantage that they show the shapes of individual faces as true shapes , but also provide possible views . The denotation system on which these drawings are based is shown in fig. 13.3 , class 4 . In order to produce drawings of objects in oblique projection , or one of the other oblique systems such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denotation system in which regions stand for faces , and adopt one in which lines stand not only for edges , but the edges or parts of edges that can be seen from a particular point of view . The examples of drawings shown in fig. 13.2 , class 5 , contain oblique lines , but fail to meet these constraints completely . The drawing on the left is similar to the cube drawings containing the " flat bottom error " referred to in Chapter 8 . Children who produce drawings of ' this type know that they // must use oblique lines to represent edges in the third dimension , but are still trying , as far as possible , to represent the faces as true shapes ; consequently , they include too many right angles in their drawings of individual faces . The drawing shown on the right in class 5 has been abandoned halfway through . This child was using a correct denotation rule ? use lines to denote edges ? and a correct drawing rule ? use oblique lines to represent edges in the third dimension ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planning error . Both these children were unsure about the use of lines , and these drawings can probably best be described as representing a transition stage between two denotation systems : a system in which regions denote faces , and a system in which lines denote edges . This transitional denotation system is shown marked with an asterisk in fig. 13.3 , class 5 . The drawing shown on the left in fig. 13.2 , class 6 , is based securely on a denotation system in which lines stand for edges . The drawing on the right , however , is based on a rather more complex denotation system , in which the L- , Y- , and arrow junctions denote corners , and the T-junction denotes a point of occlusion . This denotation system is shown in fig. 13.3 , class 6 . The developmental order in which the drawing systems employed by the children in this experiment appeared was thus : topological ; orthogonal projection ; fold-out ; vertical oblique projection ; near-oblique ; and oblique . The developmental order in which the denotation systems appeared was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denote edges ; and T-junctions denote points of occlusion . The Representation of Foreshortening in Children 's Drawings of Sticks and Discs In the first experiment described in this chapter the children were confronted with a drawing problem which tested their ability to represent shape ( the shape of the table ) and spatial relations ( the spatial relations between the table and the objects on it , including the representation of occlusion ) . The second experiment tested children 's ability to represent shape only ( the shape of an unfamiliar object ) . This third experiment ( Willats , 1992b ) tested children 's ability to represent the foreshortening of objects , that is , their ability to represent the orientation of objects relative to a particular viewpoint . Foreshortening can be defined as the apparent change in the extendedness of the outline of the projection of an object as its orientation changes relative to the viewer . In a classic experiment Piaget and Infielder ( 1956 ) asked children of various ages to draw " sticks " and " discs " presented to them in foreshortened // positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " stick " ( a needle or a pencil , in their experiment ) , and edge-on in the case of the " disc . " They found that the younger children ( below the ages of 7 or 8 years ) used a line or a long region to represent the stick and a round region to represent the disc , whether or not they were presented in foreshortened positions . However , the older children ( 8 or 9 years and above ) used a dot or a small round region to represent the stick presented end-on and a line or a long region to represent the disc presented edge-on . This , they concluded , demonstrated the truth of Luquet 's assertion that young children draw what they know ( that a stick is long and a disc is round , in this case ) rather than what they see ( the projected shapes of the stick and the disc when they were presented in foreshortened positions ) . Their explanation for the change from intellectual to visual realism ( to use Luquet 's terms ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older children , although their claim that the child 's conception of space changes from a system of spatial relations based on topological geometry to one based on projective geometry would seem to require this . Instead , they argued that young children draw what they know because they are not consciously aware of their own viewpoints . " In short , due to the lack of any conscious awareness or mental discrimination between different viewpoints , these children are unable to represent perspective and cling to the object in itself " ( Piaget and Inhelder , 1956 , p. 178 ) . ( It is not quite clear what Piaget and Inhelder meant by " the object in itself , " but from the context in which it appears the phrase seems intended to express something like Marr 's " object-centered description . " ) In this way , Piaget and Inhelder were able to bring the representation of foreshortening into the general framework of Luquet 's theory . In their account , the representation of foreshortening is just another aspect of perspective : older children are able to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , whereas younger children are not . The results of the following experiment , however , showed that the representation of foreshortening is not quite as simple as Piaget and Inhelder suggested . Fig. 4.3 shows a number of drawings of a stick and a disc in foreshortened positions , and it is clear from this figure that only line drawings , and pictures based on an optical denotation system in which the primitives stand for features of the array of light , are able to provide effective representations of sticks and discs in partially foreshortened positions . Drawings based on the other denotation systems illustrated in this figure do not provide effective representations . Thus it children are to produce effective representations of sticks and discs in foreshortened positions , they not only // have to learn to change the extendedness of the outlines of their drawings in response to a change in the orientation of the viewed object , but they also have to learn to use lines ? rather than regions ? as picture primitives . In this experiment 128 English children aged 4 , 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wooden figure , shown in fig. 13.6a . The figure held a plate in its arms , and both the arms and the plate were movable , so that they could be presented in both foreshortened and nonforeshortened positions . The arms of the model figure thus played the role of " sticks " in this experiment ( 3 , , , 0 volumes ) , while the plate played the role of a " disc " ( a 3 , , , , volume ) . In use , the model figure was placed on a table facing the child at a distance of 1.5 meters with the head of the figure at the child 's eye level . The experimenter was careful to present the arms and the plate in either fully foreshortened positions ( end-on for the arms and edge-on for the plate ) , or fully nonforeshortened positions ( side-on for the arms and face-on for the plate ) . Each child made two drawings of the figure , with the arms and the plate presented in both foreshortened and nonforeshortened positions . Drawings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighted in the figures . Figs. 13.4 , 13.5 , and 13.6 show typical examples of pairs of drawings produced by children in each age group . These drawings were examined to see whether or not the children changed the extendedness of the outlines of their drawings of the arms and the plate in order to take account of changes in the orientations of these features , comparing the foreshortened and // nonforeshortened conditions . The changes they made were assessed as no change of shape , a partial change of shape , or a full change of shape . For example , fig. 13.5a shows no changes in the extendedness of the shapes of the outlines representing the arms or the plate . Fig. 13.5b shows a partial change in the extendedness of the arms and a full change in the extendedness of the plate . Fig. 13.5c shows full changes in the extendedness of both the arms and the plate . In addition , the drawings of the arms and the plate in the foreshortened condition were assessed in terms of the mark systems on which they were based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the plate by a // single region . Fig. 13.5a shows both the arms and the plate represented by single regions . Fig. 13.6a shows both the arms and the plate represented by regions with interior lines . The results showed age-related changes in both the drawing systems ( the representation of extendedness ) and the mark systems ( and , by implication , the denotation systems ) used by the children in this experiment . The changes in the drawing systems used by the children were as follows . Very few of the 4-year-olds changed the extendedness of their drawings of either the arms or the plate in order to take account of foreshortening . In contrast , about two-thirds of the 7-year-olds and nearly all the 12-year-olds changed the extendedness of their drawings in one way or another from the nonforeshortened to the foreshortened conditions . This suggested that most of the 4-year-olds were basing their drawings on object-centered internal descriptions ( which , by definition , can not contain a description of the orientation of objects relative to a viewer ) , and that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal descriptions . However , there were highly significant differences in the way the 7-yearolds and 12-year-olds represented the foreshortening of the arms and the foreshortening of the plate . ' Whereas a majority of the 7- and 12-year-olds represented the foreshortening of the plate by a full change of shape , they represented the foreshortening of the arms by a partial change of shape ( figs. 13.5b and 13.6a ) . The explanation for this difference seems to be that when it came to drawing the arms many of the children , especially the 7-year-olds , were faced with the almost insuperable problem of finding an effective way of representing a foreshortened stick within the constraints of a denotation system using regions as picture primitives . The problem is that although a dot or a small round region provides a true view of a fully foreshortened stick , it does not provide an effective representation : a dot or a small round region looks more like a small lump than a foreshortened stick . In the event , most of the children ended up by adopting a partial change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-year-olds who did use small round regions to represent the arms in the foreshortened position made her understanding of the problem quite clear ( fig. 13.5c ) . This girl , after some hesitation , drew small circles for the arms and then , looking up at me and pointing to the circles , said , " Those are his arms ! " On the other hand , the problems involved in representing a foreshortened disc within the constraints of this denotation system are , as I have shown in Chapter 3 , somewhat different . There are no natural symbols for discs : a long region disguises the tact that a disc is round , and a round region disguises the fact that it is flat.Consequently , it is difficult to represent discs in silhouettes , // whatever their orientation ; the tambourines at the ends of the arms of the dancing figure in Picasso 's Rites of Spring ( fig. 3.8 ) look more like fat sticks or flattened lumps than they look like discs , and it is difficult to tell whether the gladiators in the rock drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , although neither a long region nor a round region provides a very effective shape representation of a disc , one shape is no more or less effective than the other . Consequently , in the absence of any natural symbol for a disc , children who are old enough to be able to draw views will be just as willing to use a long region to represent a disc presented edge-on as they would be to use a round region to represent a disc presented face-on . This was borne out by the results of the experiment . More than half the 7-year-olds and nearly all the 12-year-olds represented the foreshortening of the plate by a full change of shape . There were also age-related changes in the mark systems used by each age group , and these , taken in conjunction with changes in shape , can be used to infer the changes in the denotation systems used by the children . Most of the 4-year-olds used single lines to represent the arms and a round region to represent the plate , and made no changes in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably best interpreted as representing long and round regions as picture primitives denoting long volumes and flat volumes as scene primitives ( figs. 4.3e and 13.4 ) . Similarly , about one-third of the 7-year-olds used long regions to represent the arms and round regions to represent the plate , and again made no changes in their drawings in order to represent foreshortening . Both these groups of children were thus effectively using the same denotation system : long regions standing for long volumes in an object-centered description , and round regions standing for flat volumes in an object-centered description . Foreshortening can not be represented within this system . Between half and two-thirds of the 7-year-olds , and a few of the 12-yearolds , used single regions to represent both the arms and the plate , and changed their drawings in one way or another in order to represent foreshortening . This suggests that these children were using a denotation system in which regions stand for regions in the frontal plane or visual field ( figs. 4.3d and 13.5c ) . Although foreshortening can be represented within this system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a view of a foreshortened stick looks more like a small lump than a stick , and a long region as a view of a foreshortened disc looks more like a stick than a disc . Most of the 12-year-olds solved this problem by adopting a different denotation system : one in which lines stand for edges and contours . This // system provides an effective way of representing the shapes and orientations of sticks and discs in both foreshortened and nonforeshortened positions ( fig. 4.3b and 13.6a ) . To sum up , most of the 4-year-olds used lines or regions to represent the extendedness of volumetric primtives in object-centered descriptions of the arms and the plate . Foreshortening can not be represented in these systems . Most of the 7-year-olds used regions to represent the extendedness of views of the outlines of the arms and the plate . Foreshortening can be represented in this system , but it can not be represented effectively . In order to solve this problem , the 12-year-olds adopted a new denotation system : one in which lines denote edges and contours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orientations of sticks and discs in both foreshortened and nonforeshortened positions . These results show that the representation of foreshortening is primarily a drawing problem , rather than a problem in seeing or becoming consciously aware of one 's own viewpoint . There is no reason to suppose that the children in this experiment saw the arms as partially foreshortened but the plate as fully foreshortened . Neither is there any reason to suppose that 12-year-olds " see " edges and contours any more clearly than 7-year-olds . It seems more plausible to say that 12-year-olds have learned to use lines rather than regions as picture primitives , and that they do this in order to be able to represent three-dimensional shapes , and the orientations of these shapes , more effectively . Children 's Drawings of People In the experiments described above , children were asked to carry out three somewhat artificial drawing tasks . In the first experiment they were asked to draw a table from a fixed viewpoint ; in the second they were asked to draw an unfamiliar object , one that they would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked to draw sticks and a disc in foreshortened positions . To what extent can the methods of analysis I have described , and the conclusions I have drawn from these experiments , be applied to drawings produced by children under less contrived conditions ? Fig. 13.7 shows four drawings collected by Florence Goodenough in California during the first two decades of the twentieth century , in the course of what came to be known as the " I ) raw-A-Man " test ( Goodenough , 1926 ; Harris , 1963 ) . In this test the child was asked to draw a man , and was credited with points according to the number of body parts included itt the drawing . These points were then converted to a standard // score and used to give a measure of the child 's intellectual maturity relative to other children of the same age . Goodenough chose the human figure as a basis for her test because a number of studies had shown that the human figure greatly exceeded all other subjects in popularity in children 's spontaneous drawings . Although some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in assessing the child 's score , the " Draw-A-Man " test was based mainly on the number of body parts included in the drawing , rather like counting the number of words in a vocabulary test . Thus when Goodenough said of the young child " He draws what he knows , rather than what he sees , " what she meant was that what the child knows is how to draw a symbol for a particular body part . But where do these symbols come from ? Wilson and caption // Wilson ( 1981 , 1984 ) have argued that young children 's figure drawings are primarily influenced by the drawings of other children . Certainly some of the drawings in the Florence Goodenough collection give the impression that they are based on graphic stereotypes shared by groups of children , and many of the drawings in the collection , including those given here , look rather different from the drawings one might expect to obtain from children at the end of the twentieth century . For example , Wilson and Wilson ( 1981 ) brought convincing evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in which the head is drawn in profile with both eyes included , was very common in children 's figure drawings during the last decades of the nineteenth century , but had virtually disappeared by the middle of the twentieth century . Moreover , they claimed that they could just as easily have studied the rise and fall of other features , such as " ladder mouths . . . the crossed arms transparency ... the garden rake hands as shown in fig. 3.6bl ... and on and on " ( p. 31 ) . However , although children 's figure drawings may vary a good deal from one period and culture to another , and some children may well adopt solutions to drawing problems that they have observed in drawings by other children , the primary drawing problem that children have to solve is the problem of shape representation , and effective solutions to this problem are constrained by the design features of the human visual system . The drawings reproduced in fig. 13.7 ( Willats , 1995 ) show just four examples out of a huge range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are only a limited range of underlying principles , expressed in the form of drawing rules , that children can bring to bear in solving the problem of representing the shapes that make up the human figure . Fig. 13.7a shows a tadpole figure produced by a 4-year-old . The considerations that I have advanced in this and earlier chapters suggest that the large round region is intended to represent the head or head/body as a round volume or lump , and the legs as long volumes or sticks . The eyebrows are represented by lines , and the eyes are represented by round regions . Thus only two shape features are represented in this drawing : extendedness ( round or long ) and relative size ( large or small ) . In addition , the topological property of " being connected " in the scene is represented by the connections between the regions standing for the legs and the head or head/body . However , the eyes and eyebrows are shown enclosed within the region standing for the head or head/body . Thus even in this early drawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual role : in production , as I have suggested , it is probably intended to stand for the head or head/body as a volume , but iii order to put in the eyes and eyebrows the // child has to see this region in the picture as representing the surface of the face . The drawing shown in fig. 13.7b is probably based on similar drawing and denotation systems : that is , the spatial relations represented are topological rather than projective , and the round regions are intended to stand for round volumes and the lines and long regions for long volumes . In addition , the flat brim of the hat ( a disc ) is represented by a line . Notice that the drawing does not show a view of a hat , with the hat partially occluding the head ; instead , it represents the topological relation of " touching " between the head and the brim of the hat . The legs of this figure are represented by long regions that are bent at the end . In production it seems likely that these long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the addition of the shape modifier " being bent , " or " being bent at the end . " Because " being bent " is a nonaccidental shape property , however , the resulting regions provide possible views of bent volumes . In terms of picture perception , therefore , we tend to see the outlines of these regions as representing the contours of the legs . The drawing shown in fig. 13.7c includes features taken from both object-centered and viewer-centered descriptions . The regions representing the arms and the head are still probably intended to represent these features , in production , as long volumes and round volumes , and the arms are shown connected to the head , as they would be in a tadpole figure . On the other hand , the crown and brim of the hat are shown occluding the head , as they would in a view , and the complex outlines of the shoes are perhaps more plausibly interpreted as representing contours in a viewer-centered description than as the boundaries of regions denoting volumes . Finally , fig. 13.7d shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interpreted as contours , and the drawing contains two junctions that can be interpreted as T-junctions denoting points in the visual field where the lower contours of the left arm and the left leg disappear behind the contours of the body . However , this drawing still retains a number of features taken from object-centered descriptions : in particular there are no end junctions denoting the points where contours end . In this respect , it is worth comparing this drawing with Joanne 's Self-Portrait with shown in fig. 1.7 . Joanne 's drawing contains numerous examples of correct end junctions , and as a result the drawing provides excellent representations of smooth shapes . In contrast , the outlines of the body in the drawing shown in Fig. 13.7d merge into the outlines of the left arm and the left leg , instead of ' stopping short as they should if the drawing were to represent a correct view . This " merge " junction ( Smith and Fucigna , 1988 ) can be regarded as a transitional stage between the representation of the // topological property of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three younger children , and the correct projective relations between contours shown in the drawing by Joanne . Summary of Developmental Changes Most recent research has been directed toward describing age-related changes in the drawing systems , and in particular in the projection systems . As an irreducible minimum , many writers would now agree that two main stages can be identified in children 's drawings of rectangular objects like tables , houses , and cubes : the use of orthogonal projection by younger children , and some kind of system involving the use of oblique lines , such as oblique projection or perspective , by older children . Some writers , including myself , would argue for the inclusion of horizontal and vertical oblique projection as intermediate stages . The actual ages at which children use these systems depend very much on the individual child , the nature and complexity of the task , and the object to be drawn . ' ' However , these projection systems can not readily be used to describe children 's drawings of smooth objects like people . Nor can they be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : tadpole figures , transparency drawings , fold-out drawings , and flat-bottom drawings that include false T-junctions . Consequently , I have argued that drawing development , at the most fundamental level , can best be described in terms of changes in the denotation systems that children use . In the first stage , children use a system in which regions stand for whole volumes . The fundamental shape property represented at this stage is extendedness , and topological properties like touching and enclosure are used to represent the spatial relations between parts of objects . The application of rules governing such properties results in drawings like the tadpole figures , and drawings of cubes , houses , or other rectangular objects made up of curved lines . The addition of the shape modifier " having straight lines " to represent the nonaccidental property " having plane faces " may then result in drawings of rectangular objects that , fortuitously , resemble possible views in the form of orthogonal projections . In the next main stage , children use regions to denote either the faces of objects or regions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this results in drawings that may be anomalous , like the fold-out drawings , or drawings that may , fortuitously , resemble possible views , such as , again , drawings in orthogonal projection , or drawings iii horizontal or vertical oblique projection . In drawings of people or animals , regions are used to represent // individual body parts like arms and legs , but as a result of the application of shape modifiers like " being bent " or " being pointed , " the outlines of these regions begin to resemble possible contours . Finally , children change to a system in which lines are used to denote edges and contours . This frees them from the obligation to draw faces as true shapes , and ultimately enables them to produce drawings of rectangular objects in systems like oblique projection or perspective , and to produce drawings of smooth objects that contain T- and end junctions . It thus enables them to produce drawings that are highly effective in representing the shapes of objects , their spatial relations , and their orientations relative to each other and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final stage in drawings of rectangular objects is oblique projection ; the use of variants such as perspective or inverted perspective will depend on the object to be drawn and the exemplars available in the child 's pictorial environment . Children 's Drawings from Other Cultures All the evidence I have given for this account of the developmental changes in children 's drawings has been derived from drawings produced by American and English children . To what extent can this account be used to describe children 's drawings from other cultures ? This question is difficult to answer because of the paucity of evidence bearing on the subject . In an experiment similar to the table experiment described above , Court ( 1989 , 1990 , 1992 ) asked rural Kenyan school children aged 6 to 18 years to draw a table with three objects on it . Court 's experiment was carried out in a classroom situation , however , and the children did not draw from a fixed viewpoint . This experiment was a component in a larger study involving children from three groups ( Kamba , Luo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These groups have distinct traditions in the visual arts , none of which include drawing on paper . However , since 1985 these children had been required to draw as part of the school syllabus . The table drawings were assigned to classes generally similar to those used by Willats ( 1977a ) but with two additions . One was a class for drawings in which the table top was drawn as a true shape , but showing multiple viewpoints . These drawings can be regarded as versions of fold-out drawings . The other was for drawings in inverted perspective , and fig. 2.26 shows an example of a drawing in this class . Court 's results can not he compared directly with those obtained by Willats ; the experimental conditions were not the same , and the level of schooling was found to have a greater influence on performance than age . // However , Court 's study shows that , with the exception of the two classes described above , drawings by rural Kenyan children could be categorized in the same way as drawings by English children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very much the same . The main difference between these two studies was that Court found that the commonest drawing system used by the oldest group of Kenyan children was inverted perspective rather than perspective . Court suggested a number of possible explanations for this finding , but pointed out that not only is inverted perspective a popular east African convention , it is also used in formal education and is seen regularly on chalk boards in classrooms . Another relevant study is that of Jahoda ( 1981 ) , a replication of Willats ( 1977a ) carried out with schooled and unschooled adults in Ghana . In his introduction Jahoda expressed his initial skepticism of Willats ' claim , as he saw it , that " the development of at least the earlier stages of drawing development is independent of cultural influences " ( p. 133 ) . In his discussion of the results of the experiment , however , he remarked that " given the radical disparities in cultural background and age between Willats ' original and the present sample , the broad congruence of the findings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analytical scheme to the Ghanaian subjects , " and that " the whole range of drawing systems was represented " ( pp. 140 , 140 ) . Jahoda found that there was no significant difference between the patterns of drawing systems used by unschooled and schooled adults , most of whom produced drawing in classes 1 , 2 , and 3 , but that there was a significant tendency for university students to produce drawings in the higher classes ( oblique projection and perspective ) . Jahoda concluded that " the boundary between Classes 3 and 4 vertical oblique projection and oblique projection represents a critical divide ; in the absence of an environment rich in perspective drawings , it is not crossed " ( p. 142 ) . Studies of figure drawings by children having no tradition of pictorial art are also fairly scarce . One key study is that of Deregowski ( 1978 ) , who reexamined drawings collected by Fortes ( 1940 ) . In Deregowski 's study , spontaneous drawings made by African adults and children ( the Tallensi of northern Ghana ) who had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were compared with drawings made by subjects coming from the same population who had learned to draw under Western influence . Deregowski reproduced a number of drawings made by Tale children " unfamiliar with the art of drawing , " and some of these are reproduced here ( fig. 13.8 ) . Deregowski called these " ideographic " drawings and noted that figures of this type are not unique to the Tallensi : similar figures were obtained by Degallier ( 1904 ) from subjects in the Congo , by ! Minis ( 1960 ) // from Syrian Bedouin , and by Haddon ( 1904 ) from three subjects in New Guinea . These drawings are also similar to the stone age rock engravings of people and animals in Camonica Valley ( fig. 1.5 ) . A comparison between the drawings obtained by Fortes from unschooled adults and children in the 1930s with drawings obtained at the same time from schooled subjects , and drawings obtained within the same population a generation later , showed that these " ideographic " drawings were rapidly superseded by " Western style " drawings as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these children did not produce scribbles or tadpole figures as Western children do , and concluded that " it would be erroneous to suggest that a universal grammar of drawing ' can be derived by examination of drawings obtained from Western populations only " ( p. 479 ) . However , in a more recent study , Martlew and Connolly ( 1996 ) questioned the validity of Deregowski 's conclusions . It seems that some of Fortes 's children did produce scribbles , and that Fortes drew a picture himself to show the children what to do , so that some of them may have imitated his drawing . The study by Martlew and Connolly was based on an analysis of 287 human figure drawings collected from schooled and unschooled children aged 10 to 15 years living in the Jimi Valley , a remote region of Papua New Guinea . All the children attending school produced conventional Western-type drawings , but the unschooled children produced drawings corresponding to the whole range of drawing types usually associated with Western children , including scribbles , tadpole figures , Western stick figures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings of the type described by Fortes ( fig. 13.8 ) , but they did produce a relatively high proportion of a type described by Martlew and Connolly as " Jimi Contour " ( fig. 13.9c ) . It seems that these // children may have been attempting to use lines to denote true contours , but without having seen any more advanced exemplars : hence the relative crudity of these figure drawings , compared with drawings produced by Western children , such as the drawings shown in fig. 13.7d and ( in part ) fig. 13.7c , which are based on a denotation system in which lines stand for contours . These drawings may , however , be related to the early contour drawings by 4- , 5- and 6-year-olds described by Reith ( 1988 ) . Martlew and Connolly remarked that the range of drawings found in their study was strikingly similar to that found in the developmental sequence of figure drawings by Western children , and they concluded , as did Golomb ( 1992 ) , that each child finds his or her solution to a drawing problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that learning took place very rapidly among these teenagers when suitable exemplars were available . It seems reasonable to conclude that , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , the classification schemes that I have proposed can be applied to children 's drawings in all cultures , not just Western cultures . Moreover , in cultures where there is any evidence of a developmental sequence , drawings in the different classes appear in very much the same sequence . That is not to say that there are not considerable differences in drawings from different cultures , but these differences appear to be relatively superficial . The difference between perspective and inverted perspective , for example , is relatively superficial compared with the difference between both these systems and vertical oblique projection : in both these systems the orthogonals are represented by oblique lines and the shapes of the side and top faces of objects are distorted , whereas in vertical oblique projection the orthogonals are represented by vertical lines and the top face is represented as a true shape . Progression to the higher classes of systems in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently very dependent on schooling and the presence of exemplars in the pictorial environment . Mental Processes What account of the mental processes underlying the development of drawing ability can be inferred from this account of developmental changes in the representational systems ? If there is one single phrase that has been used over the past hundred years to sum up the development of drawing ability , it is that " young children draw what they know and older children draw what they see . " One problem with this phrase is that it is so ambiguous that it can he used to cover almost any theory of drawing development . // However , as I remarked above , many writers now interpret this to mean that young children derive their drawings from object-centered internal shape descriptions , and older children derive their drawings from viewer-centered descriptions . The evidence obtained from the experiment described above in which children were asked to represent foreshortening seems to support this : most of the 4-year-olds did not change their drawings in order to represent foreshortening , suggesting that they were basing their drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly all the 12-year-olds changed their drawings in response to a change of view from nonforeshortened to foreshortened , suggesting that they were basing their drawings on viewer-centered descriptions . However , these results were obtained in an experimental situation in which it was possible to compare changes in drawings in response to a change of view . It is dangerous to assume that just because a single , finished drawing provides a possible view it must therefore be derived from a viewer-centered internal description . For example , drawings of cubes in oblique projection are routinely described as representing the stage of visual realism ( Phillips et al. , 1978 ) , and Nicholls and Kennedy ( 1992 , p. 240 ) maintained that such drawings are produced by " matching directions from a vantage point . " But as I have argued , such drawings can equally well be produced by applying a rule like " Draw the front face as a true shape and represent side edges by oblique lines " to an object-centered description of a cube . Without experimental evidence of the type described above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual drawing provides a possible view , or even a general view , it must necessarily have been derived from a view Having said this , it is probably true to say that there is a general developmental change in the mental processes underlying children 's production of drawings which can be captured by saying that young children base their drawings on object-centered descriptions and older children base their drawings on viewer-centered descriptions . The main evidence for this is the characteristic anomalies that appear in children 's drawings , such as the fold-out drawings , and drawings of cubes containing the " flat bottom error , " that are very difficult to explain except in terms of their derivation from object-centered descriptions . It is important to distinguish between the mental processes underlying picture production and those underlying picture perception . The human visual system is designed to take in visual information in the form of views , and drawings that do not provide possible views do not look " right , " at least to Western , adult eyes . It is sometimes suggested , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for // example ? either because they provide information that the child regards as important , such as the true shapes of faces , or because they share common features with the child 's own drawing . A number of studies have examined the relationship between children 's drawings and their picture preferences , and most of these have found that children prefer drawings in which the representation of shape and space is more advanced than it is in the drawings they produce ( Moore , 1986b , cites : Cox , 1981 ; Freeman , 1980 ; Golomb , 1973 ; Kosslyn , Heldmeyer , and Locklear , 1977 ; Lewis , 1963 ; Piaget and Inhelder , 1956 ; and Taylor and Bacharach , 1981 ) . For example , Kosslyn et al . ( 1977 ) found that the overwhelming majority of 6- , 8- , and 11-year-olds , and three-quarters of their 4-year-olds , preferred " conventional perspective " drawings to " diagrammatic " drawings ( that is , fold-out drawings ) . Moore ( 1986b ) questioned these results , and found in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most features in common with their own productions . However , Moore 's study only compared drawings ( of a house ) in perspective with drawings in orthogonal projection , both of which showed possible views . Looking at the sequences of drawings produced by children of different ages , sequences like those exemplified by the children 's drawings of tables shown in fig. 13.1 , or the drawings of an unfamiliar object shown in figs. 13.2 and 13.3 , or the drawings of sticks and discs in foreshortened positions shown in figs. 13.4 to 13.6 , or the drawings of people shown in fig. 13.7 , it is obvious that the drawings by older children are more effective as shape representations than the drawings by younger children . Luquet suggested that what children are trying to do when they are learning to draw is produce recognizable representations , that is , drawings in which the objects they intend to portray can easily be recognized . However , if the main way in which we recognize objects is through their shapes , then if children are to produce drawings that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing effective representations of their shapes . Doing this necessarily involves learning the appropriate drawing and denotation systems . This still leaves open the question of whether the main factor involved in drawing development is the growing child 's intention to produce pictures that are more like adult pictures , or the intention to produce pictures that are more effective as representations , but this question is almost impossible to answer iii Western cultures because both factors point in the same direction . What evidence we have from other cultures suggests that the early stages of drawing development are broadly similar across cultures , and this iii turn suggests that development in these early stages is driven by innate media318 CHANGES IN REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS nisms . If we can legitimately speak of a language instinct ( Pinker , 1994 ) , it seems equally legitimate to speak of a " drawing instinct . " Beyond these early stages , however , further development takes place only when adult models are present as exemplars in the pictorial environment . When such models are introduced to cultures without a pictorial tradition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rapidly . This does not mean that children necessarily copy such models directly ; rather that they provide answers to drawing problems that children are already trying to solve . The mechanism behind the developmental sequence I have described can be seen as a series of interactions between picture production and picture perception ( Willats , 1984 ) . In the early years of drawing development , most drawings are derived from object-centered internal descriptions . As a result , drawings are produced at each intermediate stage that may be right , in the sense of being the outcome of sensible and logical solutions to drawing problems , like the problem of showing more than one face in the drawing of a rectangular object ; but such drawings do not necessarily look right . If the application of particular drawing and denotation rules results in drawings that look right , these rules will be retained ; if not , they will be changed . " For example , fold-out drawings provide a sensible way of showing all three of the visible faces of a cube , but they look " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosslyn et al . ( 1977 ) would suggest , even to the children producing them . In order to produce drawings in oblique projection that show all three faces but also look " right , " children have to abandon a denotation system in which regions denote faces , and adopt a new system in which lines denote edges . In theory , this mechanism would be sufficient to enable a talented individual child , working in isolation , to reach the stage of oblique projection or perspective . In practice , children need to see how particular drawing problems are solved by seeing the solutions in pictures by adults or other children . For example , the change from fold-out drawings to oblique projections is a difficult transition to make , and Jahoda 's results suggest that children are unlikely to make this transition unless they are brought up in a rich pictorial environment , or given some specific teaching , or both . Doubtless , children need to become aware , consciously or otherwise , that there are such things as views of objects to be drawn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless they need the necessary motor skills in order to put their intentions into effect . However , the results of the experiment described ; above in which children were confronted with the problem of representing foreshortening show quite clearly that seeing , 1 // view , and being able to reproduce its geometry correctly , is not all that is necessary in order to produce an effective representation of a foreshortened shape . Learning to draw involves learning the appropriate drawing and denotation rules , and children do this by seeking solutions to specific drawing problems . CHAPTER FOURTEEN Historical Changes In the previous chapter , I described the developmental changes that take place in children 's drawings . Children begin by basing their drawings on topological relations and the representation of extendedness , and a denotation system in which regions stand for whole volumes , and end by combining oblique projection or some form of perspective with line drawing , including the use of T- and end junctions to represent points of occlusion . I argued that these changes in the drawing and denotation systems take place because children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people can be recognized ; and the only way in which they can do this is to discover more effective ways of representing the shapes of such objects and the spatial relations between them . In this chapter I shall describe the use of representational systems , and the changes in these systems , during two periods in art history . The first period covers the development of Greek vase painting from the eighth to the fourth century B.C. The second includes Orthodox Christian art from the fifth to the fifteenth century A.D. In the earliest period of Greek vase painting the paintings are pure silhouettes : areas of paint on a lighter ground . Although there may be some indication of a ground line suggesting the use of orthogonal projection , the spatial relations are essentially topological and the denotation system is one in which regions denote either volumes or regions in the frontal plane . In the final period the drawing systems used are either orthogonal projection or oblique projection and naive perspective , while the denotation systems are either pure line drawing , including the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of line drawing with silhouette . The pattern of development in ( reek vase painting is thus in some ways quite similar to the pattern of development in children drawings , but there // are some significant differences . The first is that the use of orthogonal projection persisted throughout the whole period of development : even relatively late and sophisticated paintings , like the Leave-taking shown in fig. 11.3 , are often based on orthogonal projection rather than oblique projection or perspective . Second , there is little or no evidence of the presence of anomalous drawing systems in Greek vase painting , such as the fold-out drawings and drawings containing the flat bottom error which are quite commonly found in children 's drawings . The third difference is that the Greek vase painters began by using areas of paint as marks , and this confronted them with problems , such as the problem of representing details within the outline , which children , who use lines as marks from the very beginning , do not have to face . As a result there is one important change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek vase painting ? the change from the black-figure style to the red-figure style ? which has no counterpart in children 's drawing development . Having said this , there is still a remarkable similarity between the patterns of development in children 's drawings and Greek vase paintings . I shall argue that this similarity does not occur because children 's drawing development recapitulates art history in some biological sense , but because the Greek vase painters were trying to solve very much the same drawing problems as those that confront children : the problems that confront any artist or draftsman who is trying to produce pictures that provide effective shape representations . The pattern of development in Orthodox art is radically different : in fact the most striking characteristic of Orthodox art is its relative lack of change , compared with the huge changes that took place in Greek vase painting . That is not to say , of course , that there were no stylistic differences within Byzantine art or Greek or Russian icon painting during the period from the fifth to the fifteenth century . ' But during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denotation systems used by Orthodox artists that can be seen to form a significant pattern of development in any one direction , comparable to the changes that took place in Greek vase painting over a much shorter period . The commonest drawing systems used in Orthodox art are inverted perspective and horizontal oblique projection . Individual rectangular objects such as tables or buildings are normally depicted in horizontal oblique projection , oblique projection , or inverted perspective , and where a number of objects are shown together the orthogonals commonly diverge . Where buildings are depicted in horizontal oblique projection they are commonly set on a ground plane that is folded down , so that the geometry of the depiction is similar to that of the fold-out pictures found in children 's drawings . The denotation systems iii Orthodox art vary // a good deal . The element of silhouette is often emphasized , but the predominant system within the silhouette is either line drawing , or line drawing with the addition of tonal modeling ; cast shadows are rare or nonexistent . The way in which line drawing is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in which line drawing was used in Greek vase painting , and is normally used in Western " realistic " line drawings , like the drawing of a boy analyzed by Guzman ( fig. 4.1 ) or the Japanese woodcut of wrestlers ( fig. 5.9 ) , the line drawing in Orthodox art often contains forbidden configurations , like those shown in fig. 1.14 , and the direction of tonal contrast is often reversed , so that the line drawing is carried out using light lines on a darker ground . Thus the characteristic features of Orthodox art are a general lack of developmental change , and the use of anomalous drawing and denotation systems . I shall argue that these characteristic features are present in Orthodox art because they serve quite specific functions . It was important that the faithful should be able to recognize the figures portrayed in Byzantine mosaics and Greek and Russian icon paintings , but it was also important , in order to avoid the dangers of idolatry , that these figures should not be seen to inhabit a world that could be confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worshiper . I shall argue that this representational problem was solved by the use of anomalous drawing and denotation systems ; and I shall also argue that once this problem had been solved , as it effectively had been by the fifth century , there was no further necessity for any form of developmental change . It should be possible to apply the categorization schemes I have described to the analysis of pictures from any period in art history , although such an undertaking would of course be far beyond the scope of this book or the abilities of any one author . Faced with the problem of choosing examples of how this might be done , I have chosen to describe the representational systems in Greek vase painting and Orthodox art for the following reasons . First , explaining the existence of anomalous representational systems provides a test for the adequacy of any theory of pictures . The existence of inverted perspective in artists ' pictures , especially , is difficult to explain within purely optical theories such as those of J. J. Gibson and Margaret Hagen . Inverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese paintings , and in Orthodox art ; but Cubism was a relatively shortlived movement , and the use of inverted perspective in Oriental art is relatively uncommon , so it is possible to dismiss its appearance in these instances as the result of either incompetence , or " simple experimentation with Lwow techniques one the part of isolated artists " ( Hagen , 198() , p. 149 ) . // It is , however , much more difficult to apply this argument to the use of inverted perspective in Orthodox art , where it persisted for over a thousand years and formed the basis for such masterpieces as the Ravenna mosaics and Rublev 's The Holy Trinity . Second , the similarity between the patterns of development in children 's drawing and Greek vase painting is so marked that it cries out for an explanation . If evolutionism is dead , and it is no longer possible to claim that child art recapitulates art history , providing an alternative explanation for this similarity poses a second test for any proposed theory of pictures . Again , the explanation I propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cases because the representational systems involved are intended to serve similar functions . Together , descriptions of the drawing and denotation systems employed by artists in these two periods provide evidence for a theory of pictures that avoids the difficulties of an evolutionary theory of art history as well as the problems associated with purely optical theories of representation that predict no significant patterns of development . Different ages and different nations have represented the visible world in different ways because the representational systems used in these ages and nations have served different functions . The Development of Greek Vase Painting In his description of the spatial systems employed in Greek vase painting , White ( 1967 ) restricted his analysis to an account of the ways in which rectangular objects were represented . The reason White gave for adopting this restriction was that an analysis of this kind can be relatively objective : " the distortions of all angles and surfaces can be measured exactly , and the accuracy of construction in relation to vanishing points and the like can be assessed in detail " ( p. 21 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall , instead , begin my account of the changes in the spatial systems in Greek vase painting by describing changes in the denotation systems employed in the representations of smooth objects , especially the human figure . The human figure , rather than rectangular objects , is the main subject matter in Greek vase painting : there are relatively few representations of rectangular objects in the earlier paintings . Moreover , it is possible to be just as objective about the changes in the denotation systems as it is about changes in the drawing systems . Regions either have internal structures or they do not , and it is usually possible to be confident about whether line drawings do or do not // contain T- and end junctions . Moreover , as I have tried to show in my account of children 's drawings , a precondition for the discovery of more complex drawing systems in the representation of rectangular objects is the adoption of more developed denotation systems . An artist or draftsman who is tied ' to a denotation system in which regions in the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions ( as they are in fold-out drawings , for example ) can not use systems such as oblique projection or perspective because the shapes of the faces of rectangular objects represented in these systems have to be distorted out of their true shapes . I shall , therefore , take changes in the denotation systems rather than changes in the drawing systems as the primary indicators of developmental change . If we look at the whole course of the development of Greek vase painting from the geometric period to the fourth century B.C. , it is obvious that the paintings at the end of this period provide more effective shape representations than the paintings at the beginning . In Chapter 13 , I made very much the same observation about the development of children 's drawings . The drawings of rectangular objects by the older children shown in fig. 13.2 are better as representations than the drawings by the younger children , and the Self-Portrait with Dogs by Joanne shown in fig. 1.7 is clearly better in its representation of the shapes of smooth forms than the tadpole drawing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later Greek vase paintings , such as the painting of Woman Handing a Garment to a Girl by the Achilles painter ( fig. 11.4 ) , show far greater technical sophistication and psychological penetration than the Self-Portrait with Dogs . But on a purely formal level it would not be unreasonable to compare these two pictures . Both are , in effect , line drawings , and both contain numerous T- and end junctions correctly representing points of occlusion . On the other hand , the three figures in the vase painting from the geometric period shown in fig. 14.1 look very different from the tadpole figures shown in figs. 1.12 and 13.7a . One obvious difference is that the body proportions in this vase painting are much more realistic than they are in the children 's drawings . The other obvious difference is that marks in the early Greek vase paintings are silhouettes , whereas in most children 's early drawings the marks are lines . However , I argued in previous chapters that although most young children use lines as marks , the fundamental denotation system in children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are regions rather than lines . For example , I argued that the outline of the head or head/body in the drawing by the 5-year-old boy shown in Fig. 1.12 ought not to be understood as representing a contour . , it least in picture production . Instead , I // suggested in the analysis given in fig. 4.5 that the picture primitives in this drawing are regions : the large round region stands for the head or head/body as a round volume , and the lines representing the legs are best understood as long regions standing for the legs as long volumes . The marks employed in the early Greek vase paintings ? areas of dark paint on a lighter ground thus reveal what the lines in children 's early drawings disguise : the picture primitives in these paintings are regions , and in early paintings of this type it is the shapes of these regions that are significant , rather than the shapes of their outlines . Greek vase painting began in about 1000 B.C. with the geometric style , so-called because much of the surface of the vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style , figure subjects began to appear , painted in pure silhouette without any internal lines or other marks . In the earliest of these paintings there is no foreshortening and no representation of occlusion . A colossal amphora in the National Museum in Athens dating from the eighth century B.C. , for example ( Pfuhl , 1955 ) , shows a mourning scene with the dead person on a bier and the mourners ranged on either side with their arms raised : there is no representation of occlusion and no foreshortening . The bodies of the figures are represented by triangular regions , the heads by round regions with a protrusion for the chin , and the arms by long thin regions . The shapes of the legs are a little more complex : long regions thickened in two places to represent the thighs and calves , and with smaller regions at the end to represent the feet . It is difficult to be sure about the spatial systems in pictures of this kind , but the absence of any representation of foreshortening or occlusion suggests that the regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , as they do in children 's early drawings . The shapes of the regions in these paintings are , however , more complex than they are in most tadpole figures , suggesting that a number of shape modifiers like " having bumps " ( for the nose and chin ) and " being narrow at the bottom " ( for the upper part of the body ) have been added to the basic representation of extendedness . As in children 's early drawings , however , these individual body parts are joined to each other by the topological relation " being connected . " Fig. 14.1 shows a painting of Three Men , One Standing on His Head , from about the same period . The style of this painting is similar to that of the painting described above , but the brushwork of the upper parts of the bodies of the standing figures flows into that of the lower body and legs , so that the outline of each figure forms a more coherent whole . The arms , however , are still represented separately by long bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of occlusion , must noticeably where the . arms of the // standing figures overlap their bodies . Perhaps it would be reasonable to say that the shapes of the painted regions are beginning to resemble the shapes of regions in the frontal plane , and that although the shapes of these individual regions are still important , the shapes of the outlines of the regions are beginning to resemble contours . A painting of this kind represents the beginning of the transition from a denotation system in which regions denote volumes to a system in which regions denote regions in the frontal plane . Fig. 14.2 shows a vase painted in the late geometric style , c. 700 B.C. In the scene illustrated in this painting , one arm of the figure driving the chariot is shown overlapping the body , the chariot pole overlaps the legs of the horses , and one of the figures is shown astride a horse . The representation of occlusion in pure silhouette necessarily involves some ambiguity , although in this painting the ambiguity is kept to a minimum by ensuring that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown and that the area of overlap is as small as possible . For example , the chariot pole crosses the back legs of the horses at a point where we can see it crossing a gap in the legs . However , there is a limit to what can be done in this respect , and the relatively wide area of overlap where the rider 's body and legs overlap the horse is beginning to cause a problem . An additional problem is that details within the outlines of the regions , such as the eyes and details of clothing , can not be shown in pictures painted in pure silhouette . These problems can be solved in two ways : by introducing additional regions in different colors or tones within the outlines of the main silhouette , or by introducing interior lines . Additional regions within the silhouette seem to have been introduced first : in the vase painting shown in fig. 14.2 the eyes of the figures and the horses , and the ends of the axle-trees , are shown using separate regions ; but there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of development , the orientalizing period , both techniques were combined , enabling relatively complex arrangements of figures or parts of figures to be shown overlapping each other , and details such as the eyes and clothing to be shown within the silhouette . The background of the painting was filled with ornament . Fig. 14.3 shows a 328 . CHANGES IN REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS vase painted in the black-and-white style in which both lines and areas of white in silhouette appear within the main outlines of the figures . Most of the lines are used to represent surface details , such as the feathers of the owl , rather than shape features , and most of the white areas are used either for decorative purposes or to depict separate parts of the figure within the main silhouette . However , the regions representing the arms and legs of the centaur kneeling in front of Herakles are outlined in white ; and because one of the front legs is shown overlapping the other , a T-junction appears within the silhouette . Similarly , the regions representing Herakles ' legs are filled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black line . Although these lines still essentially represent the outlines of regions , they are beginning to play a first tentative role in the representation of occluding contours . As time went on , the ornamental backgrounds of these paintings began to disappear , and the use of interior lines began to predominate over the use of areas of different colors , leading eventually to what is called the " blackfigure " style . Fig. 14.4 shows an early example of a black-figure vase painting , together with a detail of the painting redrawn in pure silhouette . This redrawing shows that it is now the shapes of the outlines of the silhouette that are important rather than the overall shapes of the regions . // The convexities and concavities of the outline correspond to the shapes of the contours , and thus to the surface shapes , of features like the nose and mouth , as they do in the portrait silhouette of a Lady Taking Tea shown in fig. 5.1 ; they are no longer just bumps or dents added to the shapes of the regions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture primitives in paintings of this type are thus lines rather than regions , and it is obvious from the redrawing that without the addition of interior lines within the silhouette , parts of this image would be very ambiguous . Moreover , some of these interior lines clearly denote occluding contours : the underarm of the seated figure facing forward ends correctly in an endjunction denoting a point of occlusion . Although the introduction of interior lines would have allowed the effective representation of foreshortening , as it did in the 12-year-olds ' drawings of the arms and the plate shown in fig. 13.6 , no such foreshortening appears in this painting . The wheel of the chariot and the wreath are both shown in nonforeshortened positions , the heads are shown in profile , and none of the limbs of the figures is foreshortened . Some time toward the end of the sixth century B.C. a dramatic change took place in the mark system used in Greek vase painting : the invention of the red-figure style . In this technique the figures were silhouetted in red ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled in with a lustrous // black glaze . Internal lines were added within the silhouette , using either thin lines of pure black glaze in slight relief , or lines of varying thickness carried out in diluted glaze giving a tonal range from dark brown to translucent yellow ( fig. 14.5 ) . The denotation system , however , remained essentially the same as it was in the later black-figure paintings : regions with interior lines , with the lines denoting edges and occluding contours . // What was the motive behind this change ? Gombrich ( 1960/1988 ) illustrated two sides of a late-sixth-century vase showing two identical scenes of Herakles and the Cretan Bull , one side of which is painted in the black-figure style and the other in the red-figure style , and he suggested that the direction of tonal contrast ? light on dark or dark on light ? was relatively unimportant ; and it is true that the black-figure style continued to be used by some painters for another hundred years . Von Bothmer ( 1987 ) , however , suggested that the red-figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , that the picture carried better over a greater distance ; and second , that because the black of the background merges with the parts of the vase that have no figures painted on them , the outlines of the vase were less eroded by the decoration , and the integrity of the shape of the contour of the vase was preserved . It seems possible , however , that a more direct perceptual factor is involved , and that line drawings carried out in a dark tone against a light background are more effective as representations per se than similar drawings carried out in a light tone against a dark background . The evidence for this is provided by an experiment carried out by Pearson et al . ( 1990 ) . In Chapter 5 , I described the method they used to derive line drawings from gray-scale images , which involved the use of a feature detector which they called a " cartoon operator . " This operator scanned the gray-scale image in order to pick out a combination of " luminance valleys " and " luminance steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pearson et al . used a feature detector of this kind because they proposed that luminance valleys in the cross-section of the light from a scene correspond to occluding contours ; and they were able to show that this operation does in fact result in acceptable line drawings ( fig. 14.6a ) . Their earliest drawings were produced in white on a black background as shown on the left in fig. 14.6d . However , they noticed that when these drawings were inverted electronically , turning black to white and white to black , they looked more natural . For example , the drawing shown on the right in fig. 14.6a , which is carried out using black lines on a white background , looks more natural than the drawing on the left in fig. 14.6d . Why is this ? It is generally agreed that it is easier to recognize a person in a photographic positive than it is to recognize the same person in a photographic negative . Pearson et al . acknowledged that this might be due simply to our greater familiarity with photographic positives , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar argument might also apply to white-on-black line drawing ' . I lowever , they suggested that the effect // might be better explained by supposing that the early stages of the human visual system involve a feature detector , similar in its operation to their cartoon operator , which has its primary sensitivity to luminance valleys . In a drawing made up of black lines on a white ground the luminance valleys of the original image , derived from occluding contours in a view of the scene , are preserved as luminance valleys in the drawing ; as a result , the drawing looks " natural . " In a drawing carried out in white lines on a black background , however , the luminance valleys are turned to luminance ridges : bands of high light intensity with a low intensity on either side . These ridges would , if they had been derived from a real scene , represent entirely different surface shapes . By virtue of its flexibility and powers of high-level processing , however , the human visual system still interprets the drawing as a representation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind , a conflict between the representation of surface shape actually provided by the lines in the drawing , and our knowledge of the surface shapes of faces stored in long-term memory . As a result , white-on-black drawings look unnatural or anomalous compared with black-on-white drawings . To test this argument , Pearson et al . passed the four images shown on the left in fig. 14.6 through their cartoon operator , and the results of these operations are shown in the images on the right . The result of putting the photographic positive through the operator was to produce the black-onwhite line drawing shown in fig. 14.6a . When this drawing was itself used as the input for the operator , it passed through unchanged , as shown in fig. 14.6b . This suggests that a black-on-white line drawing produces a response in the early stages of the visual system that is very similar to that which would have been obtained from a full gray-scale view of a real scene . This would explain why black-on-white line drawings , like Picasso 's drawing of Stravinsky ( fig. 1.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual array of light from such a picture is quite different from that which could be obtained from a real scene . When the photographic negative and the white-on-black line drawing were put through the same operator , however , the results , shown in figs. 14.6c and 14.6d , were very different : neither operation resulted in an acceptable image . This suggests that neither photographic negatives nor white-on-black line drawings produce similar early visual responses to those that could be obtained from real scenes . This experiment thus suggests a possible physiological basis for the intuition that black-on-white line drawings are better as representations than white-on-black line drawings : the early stages of the human visual system may contain a feature detector that responds to luminance valleys but not luminance ridges . // The element of silhouette in both the red-figure and black-figure styles in Greek vase painting can correspond to reasonably natural lighting conditions ? figures lit from behind , or from in front , both of which might be encountered in views of real scenes ? and the visual system is presumably designed to accept both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silhouette in Greek vase painting is concerned , therefore , the alternative directions of tonal contrast ? light-on-dark or dark-on-light ? can seem equally natural . However , both our intuitions and the experiment described above suggest that the direction of tonal contrast in the line drawing within the silhouette in the black-figure paintings is unnatural , compared with the direction of tonal contrast in the red-figure paintings . This may be the reason why the black-figure style eventually came to be replaced by the red-figure style . In fig. 14.7 the direction of tonal contrast in the red-figure painting shown in fig. 14.5 has been reversed for comparison , and it does seem to be the case that the original red-figure painting provides a more effective shape representation than its counterpart in which the direction of tonal contrast has been reversed . In previous chapters , I drew attention to the difficulty of portraying the foreshortening of sticks and discs in pictures based on regions as primitives . Line drawing , or a combination of line drawing with silhouette , makes possible the effective representation of foreshortening in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing discs in foreshortened positions is easier than showing sticks in foreshortened positions , even within pure line drawings . As fig. 3.5 shows , both round regions and long regions provide about equally effective representations of discs , and the addition of an element of line drawing within the silhouette is sufficient to make clear the shape that the artist intends to portray . In contrast , a round or nearly round region , as a representation of a foreshortened or nearly foreshortened stick , provides only a very poor representation , and even in pure line drawing the round shape of the outline of the drawing is in conflict with the extendedness of a stick in three-dimensional space , as it is in the child 's drawing shown in fig. 13.5c . When line drawing is combined with the use of silhouette , as it is in both the black-figure and red-figure styles , the difficulty of showing the foreshortening of long shapes like arms and legs is increased , because the use of silhouette will tend to emphasize the shape of the outline , and thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interior lines ? especially , of course , if the painting is seen from some distance away . In the red-figure painting of Herakles shown in fig. 14.5 , the foreshortening of the bowl and the partial foreshortening of the side rings of the tripod arc both represented in a completely successful wary , // but the foreshortening of Herakles ' left foot seems rather awkward , perhaps because the use of silhouette reduces the shape of the outline of the foot to a shape that is about equally extended in both directions , rather than a long shape . In contrast , the representation of the foreshortening of the left foot of the warrior in Leave-taking ( fig. 11.3a ) seems completely successful , presumably because this is shown using pure line drawing rather than a combina336 CHANGES IN REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS tion of line drawing and silhouette . Perhaps for similar reasons many Greek vase painters persisted in showing heads in profile ( a technique very well suited to a representation in pure silhouette or a combination of silhouette and line drawing ) even when the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show three-quarter views . The shape of the // outline of a head painted in profile represents the head as a " lump with a bump , " thus reflecting its extendedness together with " having a bump " ( the nose ) as one of its nonaccidental shape properties . In contrast , the outlines of the silhouettes in the three-quarter views of the heads of the figures shown in fig. 14.8 represent the heads as " lumps " ; it is only the inclusion of interior lines within the silhouettes that enables us to recognize their features . White ( 1967 ) has described the development of the representation of rectangular objects in Greek vase painting , and there is no need to repeat this story in any detail . In most early Greek vase paintings , rectangular or nearly rectangular objects such as chairs and tables are shown in orthogonal projection in unforeshortened positions , and the ground plane is represented by a single line , as in the red-figure painting of Herakles Feasting shown in fig. 1.3 . According to White , foreshortened settings first appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth century B.C. : in these paintings , objects such as chairs or stools are shown in slightly foreshortened positions , so that first one and then two of the rear legs appear . In later versions it is sometimes possible to catch a glimpse of the underside of a chair or stool , suggesting the use of perspective ; but in most of these drawings the element of perspective is very slight , and they are probably better regarded as showing foreshortened views in orthogonal projection . There is no element of perspective in the relatively late and very carefully drawn chair in Leave-taking ( fig. 11.3a ) , for example . True horizontal oblique projections ( White calls them " complex frontal settings " ) , in which both the side and front faces of objects are shown as true shapes , are very rare in Greek vase painting , and I know of no examples of vertical oblique projections . Thus when drawings of rectangular objects in oblique projection began to appear , they had no obvious precursors in the form of horizontal or vertical oblique projections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drawings . Finally , by combining representations of the undersides of temple ceilings in oblique projection with representations of their bases seen at eye level , the Greek vase painters were able to evolve a simple form of perspective ( fig. 14.8 ) . All these developments in the representation of both smooth and round objects were critically dependent on changes in the denotation systems used in ( reek vase painting . In the earliest vase paintings , figures are represented in pure silhouette . There are no surface details within the silhouette , no representation of occlusion , and no foreshortening . In the early black-figure vases . the use of some internal lines nude possible the representation of occlusion and a limited : amount of foreshortening , In the later black-figure // vases , and with the invention of the red-figure style , the element of line drawing became more dominant and the foreshortening of smooth forms such as the limbs of figures was represented more freely Finally , in the fifth century B.C. , pure line drawing began to be used for the tomb lekythoi , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject matter . In these later paintings the foreshortening is completely assured , and end junctions are used freely and correctly for the points where contours end . In the earlier paintings , rectangular objects are shown in pure frontal settings in orthogonal projection . In the red-figure paintings and the tomb lekythoi , such objects are often shown in gently foreshortened positions , turned about a vertical axis . Finally , oblique projection was discovered , together with a simple form of perspective , so that rectangular objects could be shown from a completely general direction of view Comparing the later Greek vase paintings with the earlier ones , we can thus say as we can of drawings by older children , that the later paintings are more effective as shape representations : the three-dimensional shapes of objects , and their orientations , can be seen more clearly and unambiguously in the later paintings than they can in the earlier ones . Consequently it is possible to recognize objects more readily in the later paintings than in the early paintings . The actual course of development of Greek vase painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's drawings . The most important difference is that children use lines as marks in their early drawings , whereas the early Greek vase painters used areas of black paint on a red ground . No doubt this difference is due in part to the fact that children are provided with crayons , pencils , ballpoint pens , and felt pens with which to draw , all of which make lines rather than areas as marks , and in part to the fact that children are surrounded by line drawings in their pictorial environment . As a result , children use lines as marks even though , as I have argued , their earliest drawings such as the tadpole figures are based on an underlying denotation system in which regions denote volumes . Using lines as marks confers a great initial advantage on children , because it enables them to represent features such as eyes and details of clothing within the outlines of even their earliest figure drawings . In contrast , the natural instrument for the Greek vase painters was a brush , and there were no line drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase paintings exemplify in a pure form the use of a denotation system based on regions as primitives , whereas in children 's drawings the presence of this system is disguised by the instruments they use and their familiarity with the mark system used in adult line drawings . The other major difference between the development of children 's draw  --  // anomalous constructions such as the fold-out drawings so common in children 's drawings of rectangular objects . At first one is tempted to think that the Greek vase painters might have made their mistakes in trial drawings and corrected them in the finished paintings , but this does not seem very likely . The reason for the absence of anomalies of this kind is probably due to the fact that the Greek vase painters continued to use orthogonal projection throughout the whole period of development : the use of oblique projection is actually quite uncommon , even in the later paintings . Consequently , the anomalies that arise in children 's drawings as a result of their attempts to depict three or more sides at once , first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply do not arise . Why the Greek vase painters persisted in the use of orthogonal projection , even in their most sophisticated drawings such as Leave-taking , is another matter . Probably it was , as White suggested , to avoid disrupting the picture surface : the examples of oblique projection or perspective that appear in the later paintings do not seem to sit comfortably on the curved surface of the vase . Moreover , it must be remembered that the Greeks had no examples of oblique projection in their pictorial environment , whereas children are constantly presented with examples of rectangular objects shown from a general direction of view which they naturally wish to emulate . Against this background the discovery of oblique projection by the Greek vase painters was a very significant development in the history of painting : as significant in its way as the discovery of perspective , to which it is an essential precursor . The course of development of Greek vase painting thus suggests that a primary aim of the Greek vase painters was , as it is with children , to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive change , from pure silhouette , to the orientalizing style , to black-figure painting , to red-figure painting , and finally to pure line drawing in the white-ground style , was prompted by the need to solve quite specific representational problems ; and each change resulted in pictures that were more effective as representations . Thus in at least one period of art history it is possible , as it is in the acquisition of drawing ability in children , to demonstrate the existence of a systematic pattern of development which might justly be called progress . Orthodox Art In contrast , Orthodox art shows no such pattern of development . The term Orthodox at is used here to include the Christian religious at of the Byzantine Empire and the icon paintings of the Orthodox Church . The // Great founded a new capital for the Roman Empire , and ended with the sack of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 . With Constantine 's conversion to Christianity the age of martyrdom and persecution ended , and within fifty years of Constantine 's death Christianity became " not merely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire " ( Ware , 1993 , p. 18 ) . The establishment of what became the Orthodox Church resulted in the first golden age of Byzantine art , which reached its climax in the sixth century with the building of St. Sophia and the mosaics at Ravenna . During the eighth and ninth centuries the Iconoclast controversy raged between those ( the " Iconodules " ) who supported the use of representations of Christ and the saints for purposes of worship and as part of the liturgy , and the " Iconoclasts " who were opposed to representational art on the grounds that it led to idolatry . ' This controversy lasted for about 120 years and ended in 843 with the victory of those who supported the use of icons , an event often referred to as the " Triumph of Orthodoxy . " The period that followed , known as the second golden age , took place when the empire was at the height of its power , while the third golden age coincided with its political decline . However , this decline was not reflected in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Russia . After the fall of Constantinople , Russia was the only nation capable of assuming the leadership of eastern Christendom , and people came to think of Moscow as " the third Rome , " the center of Orthodoxy .
