I keep picking strawberries , my fingers red as the berries so I get mixed up thinking I 'm seeing a ripe one to grab when it 's only my own hand deep in the green leaves . Twenty quarts , twenty-one quarts . One more and I 'll quit , I keep saying : One more and I 'll quit . Sears , Roebuck swimming pool in the catalogue , deep , up over my knees , deep enough to lay down and swim . Ma says if we go over three hundred dollars this year , yes . We 'll see , Daddy says , and I count that good as yes . <p> Sheeba , Sheeba . We 're all ladies and girls , except for Mikey , who 's six , and Jack , who comes snooping around , nothing better to do , like he does sometimes so that Ma finally tells him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some work while you 're at it . <p> When the berries are ripe , Daddy says . When the garden 's ready . That 's when we got relatives , that 's when we got friends we never knew about . Daddy 's off all day putting nuts and bolts on the refrigerator parts when they come down the line while we stay home and do the garden : me and Annie and Mikey and baby Suse , Gramma and Aunt Bernesia and Flossie and today Uncle Jack , behind me , not letting up . You 're turning into a big girl , Sheeba . <p> I do n't answer that name . I do n't answer no name except Rex , the King , though I 'm not really a boy , and I do n't really live here . I got stuck here by accident , back when the flying saucer broke down and landed in Sullivan 's corn lot and they had to leave me while they went to get parts . <p> Sheeba , Sheeba , let me see your strawberries . Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody says . Poor Uncle Jack , his wife died and he had to sell his cows and half the farm . Too bad , I think . Too bad he did n't have to sell the whole farm and go live in the poorhouse where everybody says he 's gon na end up anyways . <p> When he keeps at it , I pick up the two quarts I got hid under a bushy plant and go over near Ma and set them down . <p> Them two 's mine , I tell her . She 's listening to Gramma yak away about what happened to the old priest when they found out he was drinking all the communion wine , the two of them wearing funny straw hats and their housedresses and Gramma in rubber boots so she do n't ruin her shoes and stockings . Ma straightens up and looks at me . Her face is so puffy and red it scares me . She wipes the sweat off her face with the hankie tucked in her waistband . I 'm afraid she 's gon na have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You hot ? <p> She looks down at the two quarts I got , then out at everybody picking in the field . Takes off her straw hat and fans her face . Her hair 's stringy wet around her face . <p> You want to go in and get a drink ? I say . We 'll finish up without you . <p> Gramma straightens up then , looks hard at her . Do n't you go having one of your fits now , she tells Ma . But ! can see she do n't mean it as bad as it sounds . Ma 's got heart spells and ca n't take the heat or bending over , but who can stop her ? <p> She looks at Jack across the field and makes a face like she 's not too pleased . Jack , that 's Daddy 's brother . Everybody related to Daddy is crazy , Bemesia and Flossie too . That 's what Gramma says . <p> I 'm going inside for a minute , Ma tells Gramma . Gramma just stands there and looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow . <p> I watch her sit down in the parlor chair and I go get a wet washcloth to pat her face . I 'm scared to touch her , cause we never get too close except when she 's hitting me . But she lets me pat her face like it 's something I always do . She 's all splotchy red and hot and she breathes in little puffs and looks across the room at the picture hanging over the television : Saint Joseph sawing wood in his carpenter shop while a boy my age  --  that 's Jesus  --  holds the board for him . <p> I get her a glass of ice water from the jug in the refrigerator . She holds it with both hands . <p> Cold , she says . That 's good . She puts the glass to her cheek a minute . Then she drinks a slow sip . <p> Where 's Suse ? she says , looking around like maybe she brought the baby in and maybe she did n't , only she ca n't remember . <p> Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie . Suse is out crawling in the field , with nobody giving two hoots . A big old crow could come and snatch her away for all I care . <p> It 's too hot for her , Ma says . <p> She 's in the shade , I say . More lies , but who cares ? I do n't belong to these people . <p> I 'm studying them for when I go back . I figure that 's why I got left here so long in the first place : try to figure out these crazy people so we 'll be able to take over . Though who would want to , from what I seen . <p> Suse starts wailing and Ma sits up in her seat like she 'll go after her . <p> Go tell Gramma bring her in , she tells me . <p> At first I do n't budge . I do n't want that squalling baby in the house with us . <p> She 's okay , I tell her . Gramma and Aunt Bemesia <p> Bring her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the screen door hard as I can and cup my hands to my mouth and holier out : Gramma , bring Suse in . Gramma ! Bring that baby inside . <p> Before I can say any more , Ma 's behind me with the fly swatter , whipping me with it . Get out there , she yells . Who do you think you are , screaming like a fool banshee ? What are the neighbors going to think ? <p> I jump down into the driveway , holding the back of my leg where it 's stinging . <p> We ai n't got no neighbors , I yell back . <p> All we got is Sullivan , another dumb farmer , and all his drooling cows , and they do n't count . <p> I could crown you , Ma calls after me , waving the fly swatter . <p> I already been crowned , I say ' . Me , Rex the King . But what does she know ? <p> Aunt Bernesia 's lugging the carriers , eight quarts in each hand , with Flossie trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries bouncing out of their baskets and down on the ground every time she wheels over a dirt clump or burdock root . <p> You done picking ? Bernesia asks me . <p> I was , I say . But now I got to pick up what Flossie 's dropping . If they ai n't all smashed , I say . <p> She turns behind and tells Floss , Slow down . You 're not in any race . <p> I 'm going fast as you are , Flossie says . If you want me to slow down , you slow down . Then Flossie starts crying , which is what she does . <p> Mikey and Annie sit off to the edge of the field in the shade of the crab apples , their faces smeared red , watching the show . Gramma 's down the row , tromping around in her straw hat and boots . When I see Uncle Jack moseying along the row with his hands in his pockets , looking down at the ground real happy , I know where Suse is . I start running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm coming . <p> Ma wants Suse in the house , I say , snatching her up from the ground right under his feet . <p> Well I beg your pardon , he says . <p> Suse is heavier than an eight-quart carrier and her diaper 's muddy from her peeing and sitting in the dirt . I try to hold her away from my body and run with her , and it makes her start blatting . <p> Oh Sheeba , you 're hurting me so , Jack says . <p> 2 . So we sit and wait . Aunt Bemesia 's drove fifty quarts off to Walman 's fruit store and Annie and Mikey sit out front selling what 's left at the stand . We wait to fill up the canning jar with quarters and dimes and dollar bills so maybe by next week we can send away for that swimming pool . <p> I go out back and pace off the size of the pool again and figure how much sun it 'll get over near the lilac bush . I learned swimming last summer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I already knew how . Put your legs out behind you , move your head from side to side , grab the water and go . I never sink like those skinny girls who do the crazy doggie paddle while the water goes up over their heads . <p> Water , swimming , that 's the best thing I know . We got no water near enough to walk to except Sullivan 's cow creek , all mud and manure , though I tried it once . I put my arms out in front of me and start moving them like I 'm swimming while I walk around the circle where the pool 's going . I can just feel the coo ! water on me . I look up at the sky while I go around . Swimming in water , swimming in air , it 's pretty much the same thing , ! think . When I dreamed of the spaceship , first it really was a ship , like the Santa Maria , with great big sails all different colors floating in the air . Then it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you coming back for me ? I ask the sky . <p> A dressed-up lady carrying a big white pocketbook is out front picking over the berries while Annie and Mikey watch her . Annie hands the lady a quart , but she puts it back down and keeps looking . When she finds the one she wants  --  hat I hope is full of smashed green berries and worms  --  she snatches it up and gives Annie a dollar bill . Annie counts out the change while the lady watches every nickel and dime drop into her hand . She looks relieved when the last nickel falls , and she takes her quart into the car , pats her face with a hankie , and drives off . Annie looks at me and shrugs . Mikey sticks his tongue out at the car chugging down the road . I hold up the jar and look at the money , wondering , We gon na make it ? We gon na make three hundred dollars ? <p> Then Gramma yells for me to come in . <p> Now what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm thinking . Do n't tell me to wash no dishes or do any housework . Do n't even try . <p> You stay inside and watch the baby , she tells me . While I go to fill your mother 's prescription . <p> Prescription ? I say . I look around the kitchen . Suse is crawling on the floor , over near the register , her diaper sagging . I go stand in the parlor doorway , looking . Ma lies on the couch , her ankles crossed , the back of her wrist across her eyes , the other arm on her stomach . I watch till her stomach rises up with the breathing . <p> I turn back to see Gramma snapping her pocketbook shut . She takes Daddy 's car keys off the nail by the door . <p> Her diaper needs changing , she tells me , going out the door . <p> I stand inside the screen door . Prescription for what ? I say to her fuzzy shape going down the steps . You better tell me , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The sun got to her , that 's all , she says . <p> I watch her pull the car out the driveway and listen till the engine sound fades away . I hear the flies buzzing on the porch and the whining of ones stuck in the flypaper . Then I smell the sharp medicine smell of the flycatchers , coming up from the heat . <p> I go back in the parlor doorway and watch Ma breathe . I count nine , ten , eleven , between her breaths . <p> What 's wrong with you ? I ask her . <p> She stretches open her fingers over her face , then relaxes them . <p> I had a little dizzy spell , she says . Did Gramma go ? <p> She went , I tell her . <p> She lays there still as a dead dog . <p> I get a funny feeling in my stomach , watching her . <p> We picked eighty quarts today , I tell her , and my voice makes her stomach move . That 's the most we ever got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to be talking , like the noise will make everything all right . <p> She flutters her fingers in the air , but does n't say anything . <p> What you dizzy about ? I say , real gruff , so she 'll know I think she 's just faking it . <p> How should I know ? she answers . <p> I 'm looking at her thinking , Tin cans . I got to get those two big ones I found over in Sullivan 's trash heap . Get those cans and more wire from the barn and fix up my radar station so somebody will find me . I got to get away from these people . <p> I go pick up Suse and check her diaper . She laughs and tries to pull my hair when I heft her onto the bassinet . Usually I do n't change diapers , but today I do n't like the thought of her carrying a load around . I hold my breath when I unpin the diaper . Then I clean up the mess , straining to hear over Suse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give Suse a bottle of apple juice from the refrigerator and she crawls under the kitchen table with it and curls up next to a piece of bread crust and a dirty sock . <p> I sit on the floor in the parlor doorway so I can keep an eye on the two of them . Ma 's snoring on the couch . Suse sucks on the bottle , her arm flung out and her hand opening and closing around the dirty sock . <p> When she was born I had a fit at Ma . I did n't want any more kids in this family , but if we had to have one , I wanted a boy to play with , not another no-good girl . I stare at her fat head and think , Sister ? That ai n't no sister of mine . <p> And then I think how our house is like a hotel , with Daddy 's two sisters living with us and now Gramma too and everybody in and out and hollering all the time and Uncle Jack coming around with his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ma 's heart going bad . And it was bad enough , but then she had to go and have a worthless baby on top of it . <p> I look up at the kitchen clock ; it hums . I wonder how much longer till Gramma comes home . As soon as she pulls in the driveway I 'm heading for the barn for the wire , then out to Sullivan 's trash heap . <p> I look over at Ma again , but her stomach does n't move , and I get scared . I 'm ready to jump up and go shake her when she takes a breath . <p> Goddamn you , I think to her . <p> Then a car pulls in , but it 's Aunt Bernesia and Flossie and they come in making a big to-do , Flossie carrying on about the man in the fruit store , was n't that Junior Menoni and did n't he say he was going to marry her a long time ago , and Bernesia saying , No , Flossie , that was n't Junior Menoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the lift bridge out , and Yes , Flossie I suppose he did say he was going to marry you but that was a long time ago , why you got to think about that now ? <p> And Floss saying , What 's Junior Menoni doing in the fruit store ? Do you think he 's looking for me ? <p> Shhh , I tell them real loud , pointing to the parlor door . Ma 's sick on the couch with her heart . <p> Shhh , Bernesia tells Flossie , and Flossie starts scratching her arms that are full of sores , and crying , Why you always got to tell me to shut up ? What 's Junior Menoni want with me ? <p> Why do n't you go sit outside on the swing ? Bernesia tells Flossie and Flossie goes to the sink and gets a big glass of water and makes gulping noises while she drinks it . Then she bangs out the screen door scratching her arms crying , Ma , Ma , to her mother who 's been dead since long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ? Aunt Bernesia says . Where 's your grandmother ? <p> Gramma 's in town getting a prescription , I tell her . Ma got dizzy from her heart being in the sun . <p> Bernesia lays a wad of dollar bills down on the kitchen table , next to the sugar bowl and some quarts of half-rotten strawberries that 's got little flies flying all around them . Then she marches into the parlor and stands there looking at Ma . <p> Are you feeling all right ? she says . You want me to call the doctor ? <p> Ma moves her hand over her face . All I want is some peace and quiet , she says . What 's Flossie carrying on about now ? <p> Oh that 's nothing , Bemesia says . I sent her outside . She wo n't bother you . <p> Ma sighs a big sigh , and I know what she 's thinking . I already been bothered , is what she 's thinking . <p> Well , we sold all fifty quarts , Bernesia tells her . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive twenty miles from the city just to get one quart of homegrown berries . My brother was smart when he put those berries in . <p> Blah blah blah , she goes , about the berries and my father and her father and how hard the farmers have to work nowadays and nobody appreciates their labor , all anybody ever does anymore is complain . And what about those poor dairy farmers ? she says . What about all the baloney they have to put up with ? <p> The room 's spinning , Ma says . <p> Then Annie and Mikey start hollering out front , getting louder , and we open the front door and there 's Flossie trying to take the jar of money from them . <p> Give that back to them , Bernesia yells at her . <p> I 'm bringing it in so nobody will steal it , Floss says . <p> Nobody 's stealing it , Annie cries . We 're right here watching the stand like Ma told us . <p> Flossie , Bernesia calls to her . <p> Then Suse starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and bring her into the parlor , blatting full force . <p> Now see what you done ? I tell Bernesia . <p> How dare you talk to me like that , Bernesia says . <p> Then Gramma 's car pulls in and Annie and Mikey start screeching at her to make Flossie give them the money back , so Gramma yells at Flossie and Flossie throws the jar and the money goes all over the grass and she runs away crying . <p> I 'm going to have a stroke , Ma says . <p> Sullivan 's trash heap is loaded with junk : rusted-out buckets and coil springs and rubber cow teats from his milking machine and two big tin cans , big as bongo drums . I pull them out and shake the dirt and bugs from them . <p> The grass is high since the cows do n't come out this far . Too lazy , I figure , which is fine with me . <p> What I got is a big sheet of tin bent in half like a tent . Wires go out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I take off the two smallest cans and put the big ones in their place , hook the wires back up . The station catches the sun , sends signals out . In the night it catches the moon . In a storm it 'll catch lightning . And if that spaceship is sending out signals to find me , the signals will land on the tin so they 'll know to come check out what 's here . <p> I sit down in the field and watch the sun striking off the sheet of tin . I chew a blade of grass and feel the electricity moving through the air , going out in space , going somewhere . <p> I wonder what the people out there look like , what kind of clothes they wear , what they do all day , if they got school and cars and bicycles , but I ca n't remember anything . My real ma ? I think . Who is she ? <p> Mikey 's the only one really knows about it . When I told him he said , Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I tried to tell Ma , but she do n't know nothing . <p> Uncle Jack 's just trying to be friendly , she says . What 's so terrible about that ? What 's so terrible about our home ? <p> This ai n't my home , I tell her , looking to see if she 'll let on what she knows . But she plays dumb . <p> How I figured it out was easy . I was out in the chicken coop one day after Daddy walloped me for no good reason and Ma stood there watching , crying for the hundredth time , How 'd I end up with you ? Where 'd you come from ? <p> All because Bernesia and Flossie had gone snooping through our house like they always do , looking for old photographs and pillowcases and knickknacks they said belonged to them from way back before Daddy got married and I called them nosy pea-brained old goats and told them to get out of our house and leave us alone . <p> This is n't your house , Flossie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Crying to her ma , the dead one , not mine . <p> Then my ma starts crying : I do n't have a house . This was never my house . I wish I was dead . Putting her hand to her heart crying , Oh , I do n't know how much more I can take . <p> And Bernesia coming after me with a geography book she picked up from the end table , raising it high in the air to hit me with it , saying , What did you call me ? What did you say , you little so-and-so ? <p> And Daddy going Judas Priest God Almighty while he 's taking off his belt coming at me . <p> Till I ran and ran and kicked them damn chickens out of the chicken coop and threw their no-good damn chicken eggs after them and then sat on top of the watering can smelling the heat and straw and chicken shit , thinking , God , what you done to me ? <p> And then it came to me , the dream I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and a sharp humming sound that scared me but made me feel good too . I remembered getting up to go to the window and see it . Right there in the chicken coop I realized that was n't no dream because I remember going to the window awake and seeing it , that part was n't in the dream . So it all fell together there , with the backs of my legs smarting from Daddy 's belt and the chickens clucking and squawking because I 'd kicked them out in the yard . <p> The more I thought about it , the more came back , and everything made sense  --  all them years of Daddy and Ma saying Where 'd you come from , Flossie saying This house ai n't yours . But I never could remember enough to get Annie and Mikey and Suse in the picture . So I do n't know if we come from the same place or not . Most likely not . Them telling me , You think you 're the boss of everything . You think you can tell everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me , Rex the King . <p> 3 . Gramma 's in the kitchen starting supper . She eyeballs me and scowls. ! thought I told you to watch the baby , she says . <p> I did watch her , I say . I watched her till you came home . <p> I 'd expect you 'd be old enough by now to know how to act , she says , turning to stir the pan full of green peppers . <p> Is Ma okay ? ! ask her . <p> No thanks to any of you , she says . <p> Ma 's laying down on her bed with the shades down and a glass of water and her prescription bottle next to the radio on the stand . <p> It 's me , I tell her . <p> She squints her eyes open . What ? she says . <p> Nothing , I tell her . <p> The room is still and quiet . Suse is asleep in the crib . All of a sudden I 'm sleepy too . I get up on the bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , since she 's nobody I know . <p> Stop rocking , she says . Did you find all the money ? She 's talking up to the ceiling with her eyes closed . <p> Yep , I tell her , though I ai n't seen Annie and Mikey nor been out front where Flossie threw everything . <p> We should make Flossie go picking through the grass for it , I tell her . <p> She does n't answer . I try not to jiggle the bed . <p> That Sears swimming pool is almost three feet deep , I tell her . I 'm gon na swim every day . I 'm gon na teach Mikey to swim , I say , trying to make her get the picture that we got to get that pool no matter what , heart spells or no . <p> Hmm , she says . <p> I wish we had that pool right now , I tell her . It 's hotter than pig shit outside . <p> I feel her go stiff on the bed . <p> I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do you have to be so bad all the time ? <p> I do n't know , I tell her . It 's in my blood . <p> She makes a little snorting sound . <p> I get it from Daddy , I tell her . He swears all the time . <p> Daddy 's a grown man . <p> Then he should know plenty damn better than me . <p> I roll off the bed quick , before she has time to hit me . <p> Hail Mary , she says . Hail Mary , I prayed for a daughter and this is what I got . <p> I hear Joe Edwards 's truck pull alongside the road out front and Daddy slam the door and start crunching gravel down the driveway . <p> I run out to meet him , but Annie and Mikey already beat me , holding up the money jar while Joe Edwards drives away . <p> We picked eighty quarts , I holier to Daddy . <p> Flossie tried to take the jar from us , Annie cries . She threw our money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it all , Mikey says . <p> Ca n't I come home in peace just once ? Daddy says , swinging his lunch pail past us . <p> Ma 's sick , I tell him . She had a heart spell . Gramma had to go get a prescription . <p> Judas Priest Almighty , he says . <p> 4 . Ma comes out to eat supper with us , but then gets up from the table halfway through to go lay down on her bed again . <p> Indigestion , she says , rubbing up high on her stomach . <p> Aunt Bernesia and Daddy and Gramma look at each other . Daddy shakes his head and swears . Bernesia takes Flossie outside to walk around the yard and look at the daisies and buttercups growing in the weeds near the roses , which is one of the things she does when she 's afraid Floss is going to start up . <p> Gramma holds Suse on her knee and pushes a big red strawberry into her mouth . <p> Not a day goes by , Daddy says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sears catalogue . <p> Look how they got these clips like clothespins to keep the liner on , I tell him , pointing to the swimming pool we 're going to buy . <p> See that one , Mikey says , pointing to the biggest one . That 's got a slide going into the water . <p> Someday I 'm buying that pool , I say . <p> Me too , Mikey says . <p> I want a canopy bed , Annie says , trying to turn the pages to show Daddy . <p> That 's for sissies , I tell her . <p> You 're a tomboy anyway , Annie says . What do you know ? <p> Get away from here , Daddy says . Take that damn Sears catalogue somewhere else and leave me alone . <p> Never mind the catalogue , Gramma says . The three of you can start doing the dishes . <p> That 's all I got to hear . I leave the catalogue on Daddy 's lap and make like I 'm looking for something in the parlor . Instead I sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flossie by the arm , steering her away from the poison ivy growing in the rose bushes while Uncle Jack stands there next to them trying to light his pipe . <p> Now what the blasted heck is he doing back here ? I 'm thinking . <p> There 's plenty to eat if you did n't eat supper , Bemesia tells him . <p> Hell , I 'm stuffed , he says . I already ate . What you think , I come around on purpose at suppertime looking for a handout ? <p> You always come when it 's time to eat , Flossie tells him . <p> Stop that , Flossie , Bernesia says . That 's not true . <p> When he sees me his face lights up , but I do a quick turn and start running for the chicken coop . <p> Do n't leave on my account , Jack says . <p> I scrounge through the straw , the chickens squawking and rustling and moving out of my way , till I find an empty feed sack . I shake it out to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for ammunition . <p> The crab apples are too small , so I head out to the big trees in back . I pull a few green apples off the branches , but they 're small too . I start scrounging for rocks till I got a good load of rocks and apples in the bag . <p> Let that bastard come near me , I think . <p> When I get to my radio station I lay the sack down and go check the tin can connections . I put a can to my ear and close my eyes , listening to the hollow sound of outer space , listening for what 's out there : meteors and asteroids and planets and spaceships a million miles away . <p> I go touch the big sheet of tin and feel the heat in it . Then I stretch my arms out and look up at the sky . I hold my arms out to feel the electric currents , trying to see if anybody 's radioed in and tried to reach me . <p> The sun is a hard little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky 's got streaks of pink clouds running through it . I stretch my fingers far as they 'll go , but do n't feel much . <p> Then I start turning in a circle with my arms up to the sky and my eyes closed tight so I can concentrate . <p> I send my thoughts out harder than I ever done : Come get me , I 'm here , I 'm here in Sullivan 's field . Oh Great Mother , Oh Great Father , it 's me , your son , Rex the King , shipwrecked in a cow lot , waiting for you every day to come find me and take me back home . <p> I done my duty , I tell them . I stayed with these farmers , I put up with it all . Come for me , come bring me home , I tell them out loud . <p> My hands tingle . I can feel something out there . I open my eyes up at the sky , turning , watching , humming . A bird flies overhead in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there too . <p> Oh Sheeba , let me take you home , Uncle Jack says , and I stop dead in my tracks . <p> What are you doing here ? I say , and while I 'm talking I 'm thinking two things at the same time : where 's that sack of rocks and now I have to move the whole station where he wo n't find it . <p> I did n't mean to scare you , he says . <p> You did n't scare me , I tell him , and I move over near the sheet of tin and look behind to see the feed sack where I left it on the ground . I stand there near the sack . <p> He moves closer and touches a tin can . <p> This is some getup , he says . <p> Do n't touch that , I tell him . <p> My , my , he says . <p> He looks the station over , real interested .

Did I ever hurt you ? <p> I just like to be left alone , I tell him . <p> One of those solitary sorts , he says . Well there 's nothing wrong with that . But you got to have a little fun in life too . You got to have people . No man is an island , he says . Did n't you ever hear that ? <p> Big deal , I tell him . <p> He puts his hands in his pockets and looks around . <p> So just what the hell is all this crap ? <p> I pick up the feed bag and start walking away . <p> Hey , there 's no need for that , he says . <p> In a minute I hear him following me . <p> You better leave me alone , ! tell him , and I start running . <p> Sheeba , you 're breaking my heart , he says . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cow field with the grass up to his knees , in his gray work pants and dirty white T-shirt , just like he 's ready to bring his cows in . <p> I reach in the sack for a green apple and fling it right at him , but it misses . <p> What you go and do that for ? he says . <p> I fling another , and then another . One gets him in the leg , and still he does n't move , so I let them fly , rocks and apples together . <p> I deserve this , he says . You 're right . Hit me , I deserve this . <p> I drop the bag and run into the woods . <p> Once I get a ways in I crouch behind a tree stump and listen . After a long time of hearing nothing I creep through the woods over near the edge where I can see the field . My station 's standing , just like before . Then I see Uncle Jack way down , with his hands in his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time after he 's gone . Then I go out to inspect the station . <p> Everything looks all right . I think of putting the station in the woods so he wo n't find it , but I 'm afraid it wo n't pick up any signals in there . But then I 'm thinking maybe it 's better in the woods . Do n't they tell you not to stand under a tree in lightning ? Maybe all them trees will draw the electricity in , pick up any little signal that 's out there . <p> I go over to lift a tin can to my ear to listen when I see a daisy laying on top of the can . I look around and see he 's put a daisy on top of each can . I rip them apart and throw the pieces into the weeds . <p> Then I drop down into the grass and sit there thinking . There just ai n't no letup . A big hole opens in my stomach . If I had a tent I could run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , I figure . I can take Daddy 's army blanket and run away  --  walk all night and sleep in the day so they wo n't find me  --  till I make it to the Adirondacks . Then go off up into the mountains and build a fort . Fish and pick berries and apples and things and nobody 'll ever find me . They wo n't even miss me . Except when it 's time to work : pick strawberries or change Suse 's diaper . <p> I look at the radio station turning fuzzy gray in the dusk . I try to picture what my other home looks like . I try to picture who my real mother and father are and what it 's like living with them . <p> Why 'd you leave me here ? I ask them . How could you forget that you left me here ? <p> I look up at the sky turning gray , the white moon showing pale and empty up there , and the hole in my stomach just opens bigger . <p> Far off I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the sound gets louder I stand up to listen where it 's coming from , but I ca n't tell . It sounds like it 's all around me . After a while I see flashing lights way off near the road , spinning off the treetops , and it hits me like a shot of lightning : The spaceship . They 've finally come . <p> For a minute I ca n't even move . I keep my eyes on the turning lights and the eerie siren sound that I remember now from a long time ago . <p> You came , I say , and I start moving toward the road . <p> But then I think of Suse and Annie and Mikey , leaving them , never seeing them again , and it feels so bad I ca n't stand it . And Gramma and Daddy and Ma . <p> Ma , I think , I 'll be so sad to leave you , mean as you are . <p> I slow down , keeping my eyes on the lights , afraid of going someplace I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remind myself . I 'm above all this . But I been with these people since I can remember . <p> Then I get really scared . What if they hear my thoughts and take off again without me ? <p> Ma , I call out , meaning my real ma , the one I do n't know . Wait for me . <p> I start running fast as I can for the red lights , praying I 'm not too late . <p> Ma , I cry , do n't leave without me . <p> <p> By Mary Bush <p> Mary Bush is the author of a collection of short stories , A Place of Light ( William Morrow , 1990 ) .
