Substituting for Larry King one night last week , Ross Perot gently prodded Bob Dole to proclaim his presidential candidacy on CNN . The Senate majority leader did not miss a beat : Maybe I should ask you that question . We could both announce it right here , together . ' ' That genial exchange underscored a vital issue about 1996 . A Perot campaign would revive Bill Clinton 's prospects while hurting Dole or any other Republican . Even as Perot maintains his tease , his advocacy group , United We Stand America , is seeking to form a new , center-right party . <P> Though still in gestation , the party would have the potential to produce independent candidacies for offices at all levels in many states . The new gambit is a dramatic reversal of strategy . Two years ago , Perot overruled a faction in his following that sought to develop a party . Some activists left in frustration . <P> This month , however , state directors of his U.W.S.A.  --  hired and paid by the national headquarters in Dallas  --  began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvass the group 's rank and file , as well as anyone else who cares to attend , on whether they think formation of a new party is in the national interest . In spirit , the ploy resembles Perot 's 1992 appeal for public guidance on whether to run for President . <P> A typical session , last Wednesday night in exurban Bayville , New Jersey , attracted 93 voters despite rain and fog . Norris Clark , the full-time state director , told the group , We 're talking about a major new party  --  national  --  right up there with the Republicans and Democrats . ' ' Though the G.O.P. 's Contract with America picks up several of U.W.S.A. 's causes , he pointed out , it omits others . When he asked for opinions from the floor , virtually every voice condemned the major parties as hopelessly out of touch . Agnes James , 58 , a real estate agent with five children , promised , We will provide a focus for people who are disgusted with their government and unable to express their frustration in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perot followers in New Jersey , the exercise is already real . They are running for the state assembly on the ticket of the New Jersey Conservative Party , an infant group that plans to contest all 80 seats in the lower house this year . If it captures 10% of the popular vote , the party will be entitled to its own ballot position for national and state offices in 1996 . <P> Local meetings like the one in Bayville will occur for two months , but already the sentiment is clear . Says Russell Verney , U.W.S.A. 's new executive director : There is a great deal of energy out there behind a new party . ' ' It will take all that energy and more to overcome the many legal and procedural obstacles thrown up by states , but Perot is yearning for a new crusade . <P>  --  By Laurence I.
