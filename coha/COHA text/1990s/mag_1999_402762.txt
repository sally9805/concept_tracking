Here 's a low-cost solution for anyone needing a lightweight mount with push-button guiding . By Johnny Horne // TRAVEL HAS BECOME AN INTEgral part of amateur astronomy today . Whether in search of dark skies or chasing transient events such as eclipses and occultations , amateurs are frequently on the move . This has spawned a market for small , highly portable telescopes , and manufacturers have been quick to respond . Because many of these instruments are sold without a mounting , buyers must consider options that range from simple camera tripods to sophisticated motor-driven mounts . One candidate is the lightweight , motorized German equatorial mount sold by Pocono Mountain Optics , which I reviewed in the March 1998 issue , page 55 . Another alternative that offers more standard features is the Multi-Purpose Fork Mount ( MPFM for short ) built by Apogee Inc. and sold through its dealer network . The MPFM is ideal for small telescopes , and it also provides the foundation for a compact , portable deep-sky astrophotography system . I tested an MPFM purchased from Pocono Mountain Optics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 8-pound mount has all-metal construction , with the fork and cradle made of steel and the polar-shaft housing black-anodized aluminum . A slip clutch on the main drive allows the polar shaft to be rotated while the gears are engaged . There is a slow-motion control in declination for the cradle with a slip clutch adjusted by a knob . Standard equipment includes a hardwood tripod , which has a maximum height of 47 inches . The MPFM swings in azimuth on the tripod to aid in polar alignment , and a wrench is needed to loosen and tighten the mount 's altitudeadjustment bolt . Adding rigidity to the tripod is a plastic accessory tray between the legs . It is also a convenient place to store the drive 's hand control - a small plastic box permanently wired to the mount with a 4 1/2-foot cord . While adequate for visual use with small telescopes , the tripod is too unstable for astrophotography with anything other than a lightweight 35-millimeter camera and wide-angle or normal lens . The weakness is the tripod 's moldedplastic head , which is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera or telescope . Photograph Test Report : Equatorial Mount Apogee Inc. ' s lightweight Multi-Purpose Fork Mount ( MPFM ) is well matched to many of today 's compact refractors and Maksutov-Cassegrains , which are often sold without a mount . It is shown here with the author 's Celestron C90 . Inset : The MPFM comes with a light-duty , adjustable-height , wooden tripod . The author found it useful for visual work with small telescopes or astrophotography with lightweight cameras , but it was not a stable support system when the mount carried heavy loads . // The MPFM can be attached to any camera tripod ( a heavy-duty model is ideal ) with a standard 1/4-20 threaded screw ; selecting one with a geared head would also be a great help when it comes to polar aligning the mount . Most of my tests were conducted with the MPFM attached to a Bogen geared head clamped to a permanent pier in my backyard . The MPFM drive uses a small stepper motor powered by four AA batteries in the hand box . I got the equivalent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drive rate remained stable until the batteries died , but the motor 's torque lessened and the " fast " push button ceased to work about an hour or so before the batteries were completely exhausted . There is a jack on the hand box for an external 6-volt source to power the drive . A small switch inside the box allows reversing the motor 's direction so that the mount can be used in the Southern Hemisphere . The drive 's 3-inch-diameter bronze worm gear has 96 teeth and meshes with a steel worm attached directly to the shaft on the stepper motor . The worm turns very slowly , making only about 4 revolutions per hour . Because of this slow speed , it could take as much as 30 to 45 seconds for any " slack " in the gears to work its way out after the drive was switched on or the polar shaft manually turned to a new part of the sky . Pressing the drive 's " fast " button reduced this time considerably , but I was still careful to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shutter . A knob on the hand box allows setting a wide range of tracking speeds from much slower to much faster than the sidereal rate . For astrophotography , I set the rate by following a star for a few minutes with a reticle eyepiece installed on a small telescope . This should be done at the start of each photography session . Once adjusted to the sidereal rate , the drive showed about 15 arcminutes of periodic error during each 15minute revolution of the worm . Nevertheless , it was easy to correct this error by guiding with the drive 's fast and slow buttons while viewing with a Celestron C90 at 80x . The declination slow motion is too coarse for fine guiding and is intended for visual observing or initially pointing a camera . Instructions shipped with the MPFM are minimal - only two sheets , one of which is simply a diagram of the mount showing a small telescope attached . Rough polar alignment is achieved by sighting Polaris in the 3/8-inch hole bored through the length of the polar shaft . Despite the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telescope or camera is attached to the cradle ; otherwise the view of Polaris is blocked . The phrase " telescope or camera " above is important because the mount can not easily carry both without some modifications . While the cradle is perfect for one of the popular 90-mm Maksutov telescopes equipped with a 1/4-20 socket , it does not have additional room for a 35mm camera . In fact , the cradle 's 4 7/8-inch width is too narrow for even a compact 35-mm camera body . A camera could ride piggyback on the guide telescope , but this arrangement might be difficult to balance . The most straightforward way to attach a camera alone to the MPFM is to use a conventional photographic ball head mounted on the cradle . At first I considered the inability to mount a camera and guidescope to the MPFM a serious drawback for astrophotographers . The variable-speed drive with its fast-slow buttons readily lends itself to long-exposure , guided astrophotography , not just tracked " snapshots " lasting only a minute or two . But guiding requires a camera and guidescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to the south end of the polar shaft by inserting a 4 1/2-inch-long 3/8-16 bolt through the polar-shaft bore . Having a camera attached to the ball head and a guidescope mounted in the cradle did not permit guiding the camera in declination , but these corrections are generally not required if the mount is accurately polar aligned . It also restricted the sky coverage somewhat , and I could n't always frame a shot the way I wanted . Nevertheless , I used this setup to successfully guide exposures as long as 25 minutes with a 180-mm f/2.8 lens . The best results came after spending a half hour refining the polar alignment . Taking this much time polar aligning a portable mounting is n't unusual when working with lenses of this focal length . The MPFM mount is ideally suited for eclipse chasers using video cameras . Most of today 's compact camcorders fit in the cradle perfectly with no balance problems . I 've watched many eclipse videos that contain priceless audio of the photographer whooping and hollering as the eclipsed Sun slowly drifts out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of keeping the Sun framed in the camera throughout totality , since the drive 's speed can easily be fine-tuned to the solar rate . The MPFM offers several advantages over the German mount I reviewed earlier . The polar-bore sight and push-button speed control make it more versatile for photography . Possible enhancements for future versions of the MPFM could include a wider cradle and a fine slow-motion control for declination . One of Sky &; Telescope 's contributing photographers and photo editor for the Fayetteville ( North Carolina ) Observer-Times , JOHNNY HORNE frequently reviews astronomical equipment . His critique of AstroSystems ' TeleKit appears in last June 's issue , page 51 .

It includes a knob for setting the tracking rate as well as fast-slow buttons for guiding . An internal switch ( arrowed at upper right ) reverses the stepper motor 's rotation for use in the Southern Hemisphere . The declination slowmotion control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate initial aiming of cameras , but the motion was too coarse for fine guiding during astrophotography . Photograph Left : With the camera mounted on the south end of the polar shaft , the author made this 15-minute exposure of the Sagittarius Milky Way with an 85-mm lens set to f/2.8 and Kodak Pro 400 PPF film . Although it is not possible to guide the camera in declination with this arrangement , he made successful exposures lasting nearly a half hour , after carefully polar aligning the MPFM . Below : The MPFM 's small fork assembly made it difficult to simultaneously mount a camera and guidescope . As described in the text , the author found a clever way to attach a camera to the south end of the polar shaft . This mounting is ideal for keeping one of today 's compact video cameras pointed at the Sun during a solar eclipse . // <p>
