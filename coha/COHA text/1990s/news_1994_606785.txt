<p> Iwould like to be able to report that it 's too bad it took an unprecedented massacre at the polls for what we peculiarly insist on continuing to call " the left " to see the folly of its recent ways and begin to get itself on track . But I can not so report , unfortunately , because I fear that even the drubbing that liberalism-progressivism ( the isms that are now wasms , to steal from the marvelous utterance made by the man at the British Foreign Office upon getting word of the Hitler-Stalin Pact ) endured Nov. 8 has not sunk in , at least based on random conversations l 've had around town . But let 's be clear about it : This left , whatever exactly it currently is , is finished . Murdered . The heads are piled high in the tumbrels , and the crowd is slaked and has gone home . <p> Is this just a postelection fever that I 'll get over with another week 's bed rest ? I think not . It 's not as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Great Plains twister . It was years in the making . The Nov. 8 returns were the final referendum on a liberal-left agenda that paid too much attention to its tiny narcissisms and too little attention to the needs of most Americans . <p> I interrupt this column to define what I do n't and do mean by most Americans . I do n't mean just white people . More specifically , I do n't mean straight white males , or white married Christian couples . I mean most Americans , of all colors and persuasions and orientations under the cosmos , who work ( or at least are desperate to ) and pay taxes ( or at least are willing to ) ; who are not strongly ideologically committed in one direction or the other ; many of whom raise children ; who want the trash picked up and the neighborhood patrolled ; who do want their government to address social problems , but who quite understandably are loath to turn their wallets over to politicians because they 're looking at their bank statements and realizing they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a politician and an open wallet should never be in the same room anyway ) . And who are more complicated human beings than the reactionary , racist , sexist and homophobic buffoons that the left too often paints them in caricature to be . <p> These people feel completely abandoned by the left . Or if they do n't , they should , because they were abandoned , years ago . They were cashiered in exchange for something that I can only presume the liberal elites found to make for more scintillating cocktail conversation , namely , themselves . And so we sit around debating the canon at a handful of elite universities and arguing over Fish 's or Jameson 's influence on the academy , while the vast majority of working-class young people in America ( a ) will never read the canon , however you choose to define it and whatever you wish to in- or exclude , ( b ) will think Fish and Jameson stand for a dinner of carp and Irish whiskey ( and be little the worse for thinking it , incidentally ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( d ) will be working like hell to save the money to pay their tuitions at a two-year college or perhaps a land-grant university so they can get a degree in whatever field they select and find a job that promises a reasonable wage and some semblance of security so they can own a home and do the regular things Americans ( all colors , persuasions etc. ) want to do , which are not , by the by , bad things . The canonical debate is important , to be sure , but it has nothing to do with the college experience of 97 percent of all working-class kids in this country , which , as Russell Jacoby amply demonstrates in his recent book " Dogmatic Wisdom , " is about simply trying to get a foothold . I suspect that at the end of the day , the black and Latino youth of America , who depend so strongly on poorly funded community colleges to help them move up , would be rather more thankful to the rest of us if we 'd managed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and difficultly undertaken studies than they are now that we 've managed to put Cheikh Anta Diop on a reading list most of them will never even look at . <p> It is a broad , long , harrowing indictment , one that could fill pages . But let 's cut right to the chase and take on one of the big ones . To wit , the single most interesting statistic to emerge from the elections : Proposition 187 passed in California with the support of one-quarter of the state 's Latino voters and nearly half the state 's black and Asian voters . I will not for a second defend that initiative , would have voted against it and hope it fails to survive judicial scrutiny . Certainly much of the rhetoric emanating from its more vehement supporters was racist . But ask yourself : Can we really write off a large plurality of California 's black , Asian and Latino voters as racists ? They may have been scapegoating , but they 're also frightened and worried about their own economic status . A black man working at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take about a second and a half to show him the door in favor of an illegal Mexican if Lockheed felt ( as it surely does ) the Mexican would n't make a stink about medical benefits or sick leave . One can oppose Prop 187 and still be sympathetic to the point that those minority voters made . What 's tragic is that things had to reach the point they did . <p> And they reached that point in part because an essentially reactionary left , rather than considering that the influx of illegal immigration created difficulties in the lives of working-class citizens and that something should be done to address the problem , dug in its heels and cried , " racist . " Yes , true enough ; but after you identify it then what do you do about it ? There 's no surer way to create new generations of conservatives ( of all colors , and believe me , it 's happening ) than to let the right take the lead on welfare , crime , immigration and other matters , because the right will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary boobs , but because the left is n't offering them an alternative way of doing things that makes any sense in their lives , and people can only select from what 's on the menu . <p> Now will come the arguments that the Democrats , having failed to carry the day in their lurch to the right , can succeed only by moving back to the left . I wish it were true . If nothing else , the election brought us the good news of the stain on the escutcheon of the Democratic Leadership Council . And one thing we know is that no Democrat can out conservative a Republican , because the ones who tried that lost too . But does anyone seriously believe that , in the current climate , a Democratic Party that stands for single-payer health care , deeper military cuts , less welfare reform and a corporate tax increase will be able to pull votes ? If you do , I invite you to visit Earth sometime from whatever planet it is you 've been sleeping on . It 's not happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First of all , they never get off the ground , and secondly the only third party that 's likely to arise in this country today is one born of what the political scientist Theodore Lowi calls " the radical center "  --  Perot people , basically , and others who despise the two parties , whose numbers grow daily , and who are not now , and never will be , on the left . <p> That 's the situation , and things will probably get worse , much worse , before they get any better . Maybe we 'll just have to let the people have their death penalty , their tax cut and their school prayer , and then , once they see that crime and corruption and interest rates and moral decay continue to exist , they 'll start coming back . That will take a generation , of course , or maybe longer , and God only knows how many poor people are going to be whipsawed between now and then , so buckle up . <p> The answers ? I do n't have them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more likely themselves . I do know , however , that one of the many ill winds blown in by the whole web of inanities that we call political correctness is that it validated and calcified  --  I use the past tense here , rather hopefully , I know  --  a system of political ranking by which all who did not subscribe to the newest and trendiest and most subversive ( superficially , of course ) policy positions on a laundry list of issues were immediately written off as enemies of " progressivism " and instantly deemed unworthy of consideration or support . That must end . Not in the name of reviving some old left from the ' 30s , because that 's packed away in the dustbin too , but in the name of remaking a movement that understands , first , that every new and superficially radical idea is not good , second , that every old  --  dare I say it , traditional  --  idea is not bad , and , last , that some combination of the two can constitute a real progressive vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those other things that were our ideas to begin with but that we somehow abandoned and let the right wing take up and pervert . We behold the strange fruit of our failures today . <p> The writer is a political columnist for the Village Voice .
