Perhaps late into the dank night , when the Smores have congealed to the consistency of government cheese and the sleeping bag begins to feel more like a moist Baggie , certain outdoorsmen begin to wish for the unspeakable : that the call of the wild would be answered by room service . <P> That might be one possible explanation for the explosion in sales of such wilderness products as L.L. Bean 's portable " vacation home , " a tent that sleeps five and includes a screen porch ( $499 ) ; or the Coleman Company 's " Event Center , " a 40 1/2-in. collapsible bar with a 37-qt. storage compartment roomy enough for a case of Chardonnay ( $29.99 ) ; or for the Starbucks-deprived , G.S.I. Outdoors ' Mini-Expresso maker , which weighs in at a featherlight 13 oz. ( $25.95 ) . <P> More than 40 million Americans go camping every year , and apparently many of them are redefining their idea of rugged outdoorsmanship . Nowadays campers can languish in multiroom tents , cuddle up in adjustable-temperature sleeping bags , roast game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go outdoors and get dirty and wet , " explains Tom Huggler , author of The Camper 's and Backpacker 's Bible . " They want to be safe and comfortable , and they want a smooth experience . " And they are willing to pay for it . According to the National Sporting Goods Association , a trade group , sales of camping and backpacking equipment are expected to reach $1.3 billion this year , after climbing nearly 20% last year . <P> Smooth-experience campers will soon have their own lavish shrine . On Sept. 13 , R.E.I. , a national retail cooperative that sold $448 million worth of outdoor equipment and clothing last year , will open the doors of its 80,000-sq. - ft. flagship store in Seattle . Spanning more than a two-acre city block , the store will feature a mountain-bike test trail encircling a 35-ft. man-made waterfall , and a " rain room " courtesy of Gore-Tex in which customers can try out foul-weather wear . <P> The growth of stores such as R.E.I. and other purveyors of high-tech outdoor gear arises from technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and materials . These innovations are unprecedentedly light and durable , not to mention increasingly resistant to heat and cold . Even better , especially from the seller 's standpoint , the rapid improvements can make relatively new equipment seem outmoded . Tents , once made of canvas or nylon , are now composed of fiber glass and aluminum , materials that have shaved a pound and a half from the average tent weight in the past five years . Ranging in price from $200 to $900 , today 's high-tech tents often feature near-vertical walls , gear lofts , " mud rooms " and windows for star gazing . <P> Should your outdoor adventure require watercraft , Mad River Canoe of Waitsfield , Vermont , manufactures a series of boats with aluminum-tubing frames and polyvinyl chloride skins that actually fold up into a backpack . Bon voyage , portage . <P> Certainly anyone willing to pay the $1,700 price tag for such compact transport might easily see the value of the $319 MemBrain Denali jacket . The lightweight parka , made by Marmot of Santa Rosa , California , adjusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , paddling briskly in the rain , strands of temperature-sensitive molecules expand to let vapor escape  --  then tighten up to trap body heat and prevent the chills when the canoer takes a break .
