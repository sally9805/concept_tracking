<p> In 1990 , TV 's greatest hits came from left field . It was as good a place as any in a year that had the networks singing a now-familiar dirge : <p> Where Have All the Viewers Gone ? <p> They came back , if fleetingly and unpredictably , for the unlikeliest of reasons : a mutant family of cartoon grotesques who seem oddly real . A patchwork of slapstick home movies glued together with corny narration . The specter of a murdered prom queen , wrapped in plastic . <p> And , most surprising and most heartening , a captivating 11-hour evocation of the Civil War - with eloquent words from long-forgotten souls , beautiful landscapes of haunted battlegrounds , and exquisite historical analysis . Ken Burns ' The Civil War made PBS and TV history by making epic events seem vividly personal and relevant . <p> It became the most-watched PBS series ever , arriving ironically at the very height of the commercial networks ' fall season hubbub , a time when innovation was the watch cry but apathy was the typical response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluttered electronic medium of remote controls , VCRs and high-concept cable alternatives . But when they come along , there 's no mistaking them : <p> - Most deserving hit . The Simpsons , a recklessly creative and uproariously funny sensation from upstart Fox and renegade cartoonist Matt Groening . The sardonic humor is geared to adults , but played at such a garish pitch the kids yuk along too , encouraged by Bart 's brattish behavior . At those consumer crossroads of T-shirt and record shops , only the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rival them . But the grownups can relate to The Simpsons , too . Maybe too much so . <p> - Most duh-serving hit . ABC 's America 's Funniest Home Videos makes reality unreal in a show that crosses Andy Warhol with Soupy Sales , as vidiots across the nation get their five seconds of fame , pratfalling and mugging their way to possible cash prizes . Camcorder sales went up . And ABC - shocked by its instant success and desperate to find a companion hit - cloned it with America 's Funniest People , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If headlines and best-seller lists for secret diaries mean anything , David Lynch and Mark Frost 's Twin Peaks remains TV 's most peculiar and pervasive cult phenomenon , even as the Nielsen ratings tell the obvious : It has peaked in mass popularity , for which it was not designed . <p> This serialized mood piece of brutal horror and funky hilarity exploded on the scene last spring - teasing , tickling , and frustrating those who gathered in rapt curiosity . It remains a litmus test of how far a show can go , and how far it can fall , and still be appreciated for what it is : a TV original . <p> These benchmarks of video virility aside , not all the McMillions in the world - and tarnished NBC offered plenty - can disguise that it 's tough today for any show to make an impact , and perhaps tougher to sustain it . The game ai n't over ' til the fat lady sings . <p> And that 's enough about Roseanne Barr - obnoxious , unrelenting , yet somehow less irritating than Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shut up and act , lady . <p> Other moments that linger in the year 's cathode-ray haze : <p> - Get out of here . This was the year that MTV banned a Madonna video , CBS suspended Andy Rooney for alleged racial and homophobic statements ( until ratings slipped ) and Sinead O'Connor and Nora Dunn boycotted Andrew Dice Clay on Saturday Night Live . Everyone survived , except Clay 's movie career and Dunn 's SNL contract . <p> - A.M. mourning . Jane Pauley became a media darling , propelling her banal Real Life into a soon-weekly soft-news magazine . But that left Today facing a less rosy real life : precipitous ratings loss . <p> - Most pathetic home video . Washington , D.C. mayor Marion Barry 's hotel- room " sting , " fuzzy images of political downfall captured on hidden camera . <p> - Most sinister home videos . Saddam Hussein 's tea parties of propaganda , staged hostage gatherings shown by CNN , with grim " guests " enduring a hated host 's hospitality . <p> - Shows we 're glad are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy-drama about a gaggle of eccentrics in rural Alaska . NBC 's Shannon 's Deal , with Jamey Sheridan engaging as a lawyer who never goes to trial . ABC 's Equal Justice , a grittier L.A. Law . <p> - Shows we 're glad are going away . Grand . Ferris Bueller . The Hogan Family . Bagdad Cafe . <p> - Sour notes . Cop Rock ( ending tonight ) and Hull High tried to mesh stories with songs . Viewers wanted their MTV , but not on ABC or NBC . <p> - Words to live by . " You suck ! " The opening line of Uncle Buck , which did . <p> - Honors bound . Best awards show : Disney Channel 's American Teacher Awards , an inaugural event saluting innovative educators , and produced so affectionately it did n't leave a dry eye in the house . Worst awards show : as usual , the Emmys , bloated and dull , making the best of TV look as bad as the rest . <p> - Late-nightmares . The Pat Sajak Show , as lulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Rick Dees , hipper than Sajak - which is like saying Jake and the Fatman is more compelling than Father Dowling . <p> - Dreamiest dream sequence . Loopy , screwy Newhart signed off after seven oddball years with a blissfully apt shocker : Bob had dreamed the whole darn show - the two Darryls ( who spoke ! ) , Michael and Stephanie - and woke aside his first TV wife , Suzanne Pleshette 's Emily Hartley , whom we 'd all been pining for over the years . Love that Bob , and loved that Newhart . <p> - Scariest performances . Both by women : Barbara Hershey 's deserved Emmy winner as the repressed ax-murderess in A Killing in a Small Town , and Diana Rigg 's malevolently possessive creature in Mother Love . <p> - Nights of the living dead . CBS exhumed The Bradys , the simpering sitcom clan grown into hapless , grinning goons . Alcoholism , paralysis , impotence : That was the funny stuff . <p> - Best TV clowns . Homey the Clown on the fearlessly childish In Living Color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worst : the Keating five and gang , performing daily in the C-SPAN circus . <p> - Still friendly after all these years . As we head into 1991 , there 's reason to keep faith : the continued triumph of Cheers , currently No. 1 in the ratings , and for good reason . This Boston bar is a comfy haven where classic comedy continues to go down easy . As Norm said a few weeks ago about some silly event or other , " Is this going to change the price of beer ? Then what do we care ? " <p> As long as we can count on Cheers being there on Thursday nights , what do we care ?
