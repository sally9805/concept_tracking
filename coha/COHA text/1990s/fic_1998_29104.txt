HUNGER I OFTEN DREAM ABOUT THE RESTAURANT where I met Tian . Late at night , in these blue rooms , the memory flickers up before me , dim and silent , never changing . I see the simple neon sign that reads " Vermilion Palace . " The drifting snow blows up against the scarlet double doors . I see myself walking toward those doors -- a slight , brown girl with hair like an inkbrush , tilted eyes , and a wary mouth . For my first few months in New York City , I could not stay warm . I wore a heavy coat and wound myself in woolen scarves , but the chill went deep beneath my skin , and the winter wind found every crevice as I walked to the restaurant on numb feet , past the subway stop , the university , and the music school , my gaze fixed on the icy pavement to keep myself from falling . I could not taste my food or feel the softness of my narrow bed . I had been in the city for two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one evening I heard a student practicing . Walking past a basement window , I caught the thread of a violin melody , high and sweet as a woman 's voice . The sound rose up through a crack in the window and between the safety bars ; it shimmered through me , a wave of color , blooming past the gray tenements and toward the narrow sky . I drew one cold , sweet breath of air and truly understood that I had arrived in America . A few days later , I saw Tian . He might have been to the restaurant a dozen times before , but I do not remember seeing him until after the music . I noticed him on a stormy evening near the end of winter . He arrived just at the time of day when the low , gray light changes to dusk . I was standing at the window , watching the falling snow make bright flecks in the headlamps of the taxicabs , when a man appeared in the doorway , carrying a violin case . " One person , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1967 , many new Chinese had come to live on Manhattan 's Upper West Side . Most of them turned up at the restaurant , sooner or later . But not many spoke English with such ease . He wore a brown felt hat , and his overcoat seemed cut to fit his shoulders ; most of the other men seemed content to wear whatever would make do . " Come with me , " I replied , in Mandarin . I did not want him to hear my voice in broken English words . I seated him and poured his tea , looking down at the swirl of leaves in the water . I felt the heat of the steam in my face , the warm steel handle in my hands ; I watched the tea leaves drift and slide against the blue and white cup . He thanked me in Chinese . His dark eyes followed the line of my face , my throat , down to my starched white shirt . For the first time , I felt warm . Before I left Taiwan , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beware a man whose cheekbones are too high or low . Watch out for one who smiles too much . And stay away from a man who gambles . " Her warnings implied that I had a choice ; that these things lay under my control . But when I was a child she had often talked about the Chinese myth that every man and every woman was joined at birth to their mate by an invisible , enchanted thread . With this story , she said that there could be no controlling fate . The strange man ordered beef noodle soup and drank it quickly . He had placed his violin case in the opposite chair , upright and facing him like a lover . I watched his ivory chopsticks flash , and I envied the violin case , dark and slender , curved like a woman . Then he glanced at his watch . He flung down a dollar , seized his coat and violin , and walked out the door . I looked twice to make sure it was true : he had forgotten his hat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stole Tian 's hat . Perhaps his solitude gave me strength . I looked around to make sure no one watched me . Then I slipped over to his table and picked up the hat , brought it back behind my counter . He had printed his name inside : Tian Sung . I waited through my shift . Da Dao , the manager , left to fix a leak in the kitchen , so I stood at the window , idle , as the wind blew mittens and lost bus passes past my eyes . The traffic thinned out , and a red-striped awning tumbled down the avenue . Toward the end of my shift , I caught Da Dao in the storeroom sipping from a flask . He offered to snap a week of beans in exchange for my silence , but I promised I would n't tell anyone . Late that night , when the busboys had begun to vacuum under the chairs , the man reappeared in the doorway . I still remember his bare , wet head and sodden trench coat , creased with snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might have something of mine , " he said , in Mandarin this time . " I do n't think so . " " Would you please take a look ? " I bent and looked under the counter . There was the hat , where I had hidden it , on the shelf behind some extra bud vases . I knelt and took it into my hands . Seconds passed . " Did you find a hat ? " I heard him ask . I stood up and nodded , then shook my head . " Are you all right ? " I held my hands behind the counter and did not answer . I could not give him the hat . My hands grew cold ; I could not breathe . I looked at him . The storm had streaked his hair into his eyes -- surely the blackest eyes of any man I 'd ever met , the eyelashes laid flat with melting snow . They held an expression of deep and painful privacy . And at that moment I believed I knew what would come to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the man who wore it . My senses opened ; I grew large . I believed I heard , in the howling wind , a voice of admonition , but in the end I listened to the plunge and whistle of my blood . I put the hat into his beautiful , long-fingered hands . BEHIND this painted wall , beneath this layer of new sheathing , hides the story of our lives together . I have been silent many years , and my daughters have chosen to forget , but our family story lingers here . It waits under the floor ; it has slid into the crawl space , wound around the stubborn beams and girders that were already old thirty years ago , when Tian and I first came to live in Brooklyn . At that time , the brownstones had begun to wear away . They stood in patient rows , like tablets in a soldiers ' graveyard , crumbled and soft around the edges . We considered other places : a Chinatown walk-up owned by Dao , a drafty room near the music school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect as a jewel box ; but we decided to live here . It seemed that nothing in the world could disturb us on this neglected street , in these softly falling houses . Our third-floor flat , the " servants ' quarters , " pleased me with its wide back windows , sloping floors , and odd-shaped rooms that had been planned and built according to someone 's idea of what servants might want or need . The spacious kitchen and living room invited company , togetherness , and warmth . The two small bedrooms stared from opposite ends of the flat . In the back bedroom , off the kitchen , I planned a nursery for the son I hoped to bear . I loved to stand in that room and look out of its one large window , past the iron fire stairs and over the small backyards , crisscrossed by a lattice of laundry lines . I saw rows of neat , gray rooftops , treetops , electricity lines , and , far away , depending on the weather , the gray or glittering cutout of Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world had been tucked into this space , that my children would look out at the world and know that all was well . Tian focused his desires on a different part of the house . Behind the foyer stood a spacious walk-in closet that had been refitted as a greenhouse , with a skylight and glass shelves . This would be his music room . He removed the shelves , soundproofed the walls with pressed Styrofoam , and repainted them eggshell white . He found an old upright piano at a junk shop on Coney Island Beach and convinced someone at the restaurant to help him move it up the stairs . Finally , he produced from his briefcase a metal music stand , which unfolded at the top into fragile , steel wings . " Now I can work and be near you . " He reached to touch my face . I stood perfectly still , arrested by the scent of his hand . Desire soaked through my skin -- this warmth , which had first blossomed while I poured his tea and now flowed through me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come over me even when I was alone , looking out the window , or standing behind the counter at the restaurant . My breath would stop in my throat , my skin would flush , and I would feel the warmth steeping through my blouse until I had to step out for fresh air or run to the bathroom to wash my face . We made love on the floor of the new practice room . I remember my belief -- a moment of certainty just prior to abandoning thought -- that our moans and cries and our foreign words of love would permeate the walls of the apartment and transform the place . Later , after I had gone to sleep , the telephone rang : it was my mother calling from Taiwan . I sat on the bed in the dark with the phone in my hand , looking out the window , where light from the streetlamp streamed over the cracked sidewalk like frost . " I have been thinking of you , " my mother said . " I have been thinking about you all day . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability , which had been so comforting to us both when I was young , had grown more difficult as I had gotten older , and after the death of my father it had become unbearable for both of us . For this reason , among others , we agreed I should go to the United States . My mother wrote a letter to a man who had owed my father a favor , asking him to claim me as a paper relative . " I 'm fine , " I said . " There 's nothing new . " " How is your English class ? " I had stopped attending months before . " It 's fine . " " You need to learn English , " she told me . " I know a lot of it , " I said . " You are n't studying , " my mother said . " Instead , you have met a man and married . " " That is not how or why it happened . " " Where is he now ? " " He is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lines between us . Far away , I could hear the faint thread of the violin . Had I said something wrong ? I took a breath and waited for sharp words . But she said simply , " It is yuanfen . " For as long as I remembered , she used this expression only when discussing marriage , but she never would explain . " What do you mean by yuanfen ? " She thought for a minute and replied , " It means : that apportionment of love which is destined for you in this world . " TIAN 'S connection to the music school was , in his view , tenuous . After completing a master 's degree , he had been kept on as an instructor of pre-college students , a position that gave him , and several others , an opportunity to display their teaching and performing skills in pursuit of an assistant professorship . He planned to give his junior-faculty recital in March . That winter , after we moved to Brooklyn , he shut himself in the tiny room for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a point with these recital pieces where the smallest issues were significant and demanded his private concentration . From the kitchen , I listened to his faint practicing ; the soundproofing did not completely block the music but blurred and softened it , absorbing it deep within the wall . On the morning of Tian 's recital , I woke up alone . As I lay in bed , listening to his swooping , dizzying warm-up scales , I suddenly felt our narrow room pitch up and down like a ship on a swell . I tumbled out of bed and staggered to the bathroom , where I bent down and seized the toilet , waiting there until I was sick . As I knelt against the cold floor and vomited again , I understood that Tian and I would have a child . It seemed to me that some spiritual power had focused upon me -- that I knelt before a tablet of our ancestors . I wanted to meditate , burn incense as a sign of thanks to them and as a caution against any harm that might come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moment later I found myself in the hallway , breathing hard , my hand on the knob of the door to Tian 's little room . The music stopped . Cautiously I turned the knob . But he had not heard ; he re-tuned his instrument and impatiently began his piece again . Perhaps it would not be wise to share my news , so close to his recital . After all , we had not planned for this . I tiptoed away . That evening we had a light dinner and left early . We boarded the subway , sitting side by side as if we were brother and sister . I stretched my legs in front of me to make him notice my new shoes . But he did not notice . I stared at the soft , black shoes myself as we lurched along in the empty car . The steel car roared and rushed . We held Tian 's violin case over our laps ; he clutched the canvas cover tightly . The fluorescent lights cast bruised shadows on his high , sallow cheekbones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I felt as if I were encased in a bubble of happiness and illness . I did not want to ruin his concentration . I folded my gloved , trembling hands over the violin case ; I had dressed protectively in a hat , a scarf , and a long wool coat . We arrived early , to an almost empty recital hall . Far to the left , by himself , sat an older man with a thick head of gray hair and a big mustache . This , Tian whispered , was Professor Spaeth , his former teacher and now his dean . Every now and then , someone would come up and chat with Spaeth for a minute or two , but his responses were brief , and none of the visitors stayed for long . Tian vanished into a door next to the stage . I sat alone in the third row , too shy to turn around and watch the students and colleagues who came in groups of twos or threes and scattered themselves among the seats . They spoke fluently , as carelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their English and knew that I would not be able to hold my own in any conversation . I could only make out a few words , including " teacher , " " China , " " curious . " Before I came to this country , I felt at home in the Chinese language , the way a fish feels at home in the sea . When I came to New York I vowed to practice speaking English , but it was difficult , working in the restaurant . I did not talk to customers ; I did not own a television . I took classes at a community college but made little progress with the humped and tangled grammar . Instead , I spent my spare time reading novels I bought and traded with the other waitresses , books that had seduced me with their bright , familiar covers , lined up along the shelves in the Chinatown stores . Now , as I sat alone , I was overtaken by fear . I longed to be back home in Brooklyn , curled up in Tian 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lights dimmed and Tian took the stage with John O'Neill , his accompanist and officemate . I had never met John , although Tian often spoke about him , and I was surprised by his height , his reddish beard . The audience gave a generous welcome . The clapping died down , the two men bowed , then took their places , Tian in front of the piano . His bow struck the strings . It seemed to drop from above , the way a hawk will plunge with sudden swiftness to its victim . Tian bent and swayed in the vivid light , dark and wild and foreign , altogether unfamiliar . A vein in his right jaw , which I had only briefly noticed , rippled and stood out . It was like watching a man have a seizure . He terrified me . His music shuddered through me with a violence I am not sure I can describe -- now delicate and now enormous , but always more powerful than his swaying , fragile figure on the stage . I felt as if he had achieved these sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself pulling away from him , my back pressed tight against the chair . How could I have chosen such an unforgiving man ? I knew nothing about music , but I could hear in these sounds a man who would accept no excuse from anyone or anything close to him . The violin , uncaged from the practice room , filled the recital hall with a clear intensity ; each note attacked the air , quick and piercing as a dagger . I fought an urge to run from the auditorium . Finally , he stopped . There came a prolonged and steady storm of applause . I kept my wet hands tightly folded . Tian looked straight at me and smiled , reappearing from this monstrousness . Then I did applaud . He raised the violin and began his next piece . Afterwards , we stood next to a bowl of orange punch . Tian spoke to the people who crowded us . Sometimes he made an introduction : " Min , this is Jennings . He and I share a practice locker . " I nodded and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " they assured me , so I nodded and smiled again . Sometimes I turned to Tian for a translation , but he seemed to be having problems with his English ; he stumbled over certain words and leaned toward the others as if he could n't hear what they were saying . He would n't move from my side , and he clutched his violin case in his hand . I noticed it needed a new cover and the leather straps on the handle looked worn . I frowned ; it seemed wrong that his colleagues should see him with such old things . His black wingtips were brightly polished but rounded at the soles and heels . The lapels of his jacket had frayed a little . Since our marriage , I had watched over his eating and sleeping habits , but I needed to spend more time mending his clothes and coaxing him to buy new things . I felt relieved that his overcoat hung around the corner , on the coatrack , where no one would see how shabby it was . Tian 's colleagues lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert attention , as if he had sprung up , suddenly , into the light . This puzzled me , since I had seen them before while visiting the school and they had paid Tian little notice . I remember one woman in particular , redheaded and milky-pale . This was Lydia Borgmann , whom Tian had told me about : an instructor in the same year as Tian , one of his colleagues who was vying for a professorship . She was only about my size , but she wore stacked heels that brought her closer in height to the others . She kept putting her hand on Tian 's arm -- not necessarily to flirt , I decided after watching her closely , but to give an impression of friendship . Tian felt so happy about the recital he did not even notice . He bent his head in the Chinese way and fended off their compliments . After a while , my toes in the high-heeled shoes began to lose all sense of feeling . The glass globe lamps seemed to dim and brighten . Tian looked at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese . " You look tired . " He turned to the other musicians . " We 're going , " he said . " I 've got to get Min home in time to sleep . She is not --  " he paused and struggled with his English " she 's not one of us crazy musician types . " " Do n't leave so soon ! Come and have a beer , " said John . Tian shook his head . " No , we should really be getting home . " We waited through a moment of silence . Then the redheaded woman said , " Come on , Tian . Do n't be a party-pooper . " Her green-shadowed eyes widened as she spoke . John said , his voice still cheerful , " Liddy is right . " " No , " Tian repeated . " Min is tired . " " I -- okay , " I said . It had begun to seem that we would lose face if we did n't go . Tian turned to me . " I know you , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No secret codes allowed ! What did you say to her , Tian ? " Lydia demanded . Her face loomed close : the pale bright eyes , the freckles faintly glowing under a coat of powder , the slash of lipstick , orange in the light . We all stood for a minute , and then I said , " It is okay . " My voice cracked against the words . They fixed their eyes on me . " Come on , " said Tian . He took my arm and pulled me around the corner , to the coatrack . " I 'm not that tired ; I could have gone out with them . " I relaxed as I slipped into the familiar Mandarin language , thoughts forming easily again . " Why did you want to leave so much ? " Tian put his arm around me . " We do n't need them , " he said . " Aside from John , they 're not my friends . I want to go home . " I leaned into him . I could smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shirt , and it was with some uneasiness that I realized he was happier than I had ever seen him . That was when I blurted out , " Your playing scares me . " He laughed . " It 's because of the way you are . It 's why you 're happy reading novels . You 're only comfortable with a piece of the world that you can hold in your hand . " I considered my hands , small and ordinary in black wool gloves . Tian laid his cheek against my hair . " I do n't mean to hurt your feelings , " he said . " Sometimes I 'm afraid of music , too . I think that 's the reason I married you . " We found our coats and left the hall , walked into the clear winter night , where the lights from the taller buildings surrounded us like stars . Tian took my arm . The pain in my feet vanished , and we walked toward the subway stop . " When I get promoted , " Tian said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be able to spend more time at home . " " Professor Sung . " " Professor Sung . Professors ' wives do n't take the subway . You 'll ride heated cabs everywhere . " " I 'll get into a cab whenever I 'm bored and want something to do . " " And you 'll never snap another bean , " Tian added , pointing at the Vermilion Palace , across the street . Its neon sign glowed red . " Did Spaeth say anything to you afterwards ? " I asked . " Oh , he got up and left right away . He always does that . " " He never goes out to have a drink with his students ? " " He is antisocial . " " So it is acceptable to be antisocial ? " " I never thought about it , " he said . " I suppose so . Why do you ask ? " We were at the top of the subway stairs . I reached into my coat pocket for our tokens . My gloved fingers touched an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pulled it out and held it under the streetlight . It was a tuning fork . " What ? " I stopped walking . " How did this get here ? " Tian took the fork ; it glinted in his palm . " Who knows ? " he said . " This is a nice one . " He struck the fork on his knee . " Hold still , " he said , and he set the base knob on my forehead . I stood still . I could feel it , like a current running all the way down my spine and between my legs , the powerful tiny thrumming of a perfect " A. " Tian put his gloved hands on both sides of my head , and kissed me where the tuning fork had been . I heard in his laugh a fierce recklessness . He dropped the fork into his pocket . " A gift from heaven , " he said . I heard the powerful rush of the train , like a monster rumbling deep below . He grabbed my arm and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , versatile and sly . If Tian ate a little less dinner one day , I would take care not to serve that dish again . He did not like our downstairs neighbor , Mrs. Lici , so I avoided her . One afternoon , we went for a walk in the park and I noticed him staring at a little boy . I threw a penny in the wishing-pond ; I hoped our child would be a boy . It mattered more to please him than to understand him . But as time went on , I wondered why he felt the way he did . He had strong feelings about many little things . He insisted that we keep the chopsticks in a certain drawer . The forks and spoons went in another . And he had a special idea as to the rhythms of our days . Mornings must begin with a bowl of porridge , fermented tofu , and youtiao , a fried bread that I learned to pick up regularly in Chinatown . Over these dishes he would smile and joke . Evenings were another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would sit in his small armchair , watching the patterns made from the setting sun through a wave in the window glass . This moody distance grew worse after his recital . A few nights after the performance , he stopped by the restaurant to pick me up on his way home . When he had finished at school he often came by the restaurant and waited for me , helped us finish our work by snapping beans or peapods . As I worked the register , I watched him sitting with the men at the corner table around an enormous steel bowl of beans . Da Dao made a joke and Tian responded with a remark that made them all laugh . Seeing this I felt an odd sense of relief . For a moment I believed that he could be just like the others ; he was one of the others . " Your husband is a neat and hardworking man , " said a waitress . " Nali , that 's in no way true , " I said , to be polite . If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that I lived with a stranger . As we walked out of the Vermilion Palace , into the floating night city , I could not sense the shape and location of his soul . Only when he performed ; only then had I truly seen my husband . What I saw had frightened me . But aside from that performance , I could not see any further . I tucked my hand in his arm ; we kept walking . He treated me kindly ; he did not refuse to help at home . In fact , he was fussy about it . He wanted a role in things domestic , down to the placement of the furniture . He had a plan about where each piece would go . The bed must be pushed against the wall , so we would catch the light at a certain angle . We must enter and leave the bed from the left side . This interest in our house , although it should have comforted me , left me more confused . He was so exacting , but he did not explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if it had to do with feng shui and the old superstitions ; I considered the idea that he might believe in these things , despite his statement to the contrary . Since the day of Tian 's recital , I had been waiting to tell him he would become a father . I had dreamed of this , planned for this ; he had not objected to those plans . Why was it then , I wondered , that I did not want to tell him ? I had waited until after the recital , but afterwards I had still held back . Surely , I thought , there would be a time when I could share this news with a feeling of absolute certainty , security , and happiness . Would it not be tonight ? We boarded the subway train . " How was your practice session ? " I asked . He shook his head . " Still unreal . Everything is unreal . I feel empty -- the way I imagine a woman must feel after she has had a child . " I opened my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely that must be a good feeling , then . " " I do n't imagine so , " he said . " All that waiting , hoping , building . There is bound to be an emptiness after such an experience . " He spoke casually , conversationally . At home , undressing in front of our closet , I turned to him and told him , " I am pregnant . " He was unbuttoning his shirt . He looked up , stared at me , but my statement did not stop his clever fingers . Why were my own hands suddenly clumsy ? " Congratulations , " he said . " Are you happy ? " I asked . I slid between the soft , cold sheets . He got into bed and put his arm over my shoulders . " Yes . " This ended our discussion . The next day , he came home for dinner even more silent than usual . Had I put too much soy sauce in the chicken ? Hopefully , I brought him a bottle of beer and watched him drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after dinner , I could not be silent . We sat side by side in our cloth-covered armchairs , I asked him , " Do you not want children ? Is that the problem ? " " It makes you happy . " " And you ?

" Silence . When he spoke , he said very gently , " I think we should put off having a second child until we 're sure we 're ready . " " What is wrong ? " I cried . " What 's bothering you ? " He was sunk in contemplation of the wooden floor . " There is nothing bothering me . " " Please , " I said . " You must tell me . " I felt ashamed ; it was like begging . I only wanted him to take me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair , frowning to himself , as if he were making a deal with whatever powers that held him back . " This is a story that I should n't tell , but I 'll tell you , since it 's important to you . I wo n't tell you much . Just enough so you can understand that it has nothing to do with you . " He stopped as if to rest . I did not like the words " It has nothing to do with you . " I knew they were words I would remember . " Everyone , " he began again , " has things they want to do in their lives . But sometimes there is only one thing -- one thing that a person must do . More than what he is told to do , more than what he is trained to do . Even more than what his family wants him to do . It is what he hungers for .

" To stay in China , to help the country -- these were the goals all good young men in those days had wanted . " I understand --  " " No , " he said , and the vein in his jaw stood out . " You can not understand . " There was a long silence after this . Finally he said , " On the evening I left home , my father would only say one thing . You forget about us , ' he said . If you truly want to leave us , to leave this home , to desert your country , then this family is no longer your family . I am no longer your father . You have no right ever to think of us .

" For half an hour , we sat in the dark . " Now let us never talk about this , " he said . I had grown up on Taiwan with my mother and my father , until his death . We lived quietly , far away from the worst of the war and the turmoil of what happened after . I had been too young to remember much of anything . I had feared only the mail , the letters fragile and white , as thin as tissue . Their news was never hopeful , never good . Sometimes after we received mail , I would look behind the house and see my mother crying underneath the palm tree , holding a frail , white letter . When I asked her what had happened , she explained to me that her family , some living and some buried in the earth of China , was being destroyed -- driven far and wide , or killed , our village taken over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family blood flowed only through a few women now : through my mother and aunt , and me . And I had understood that there could be nothing as precious as children and the thread of family blood . Tian did not discuss his childhood again . He never mentioned what had happened to his parents , how he had managed to flee the north and head to the coast , when he was just a teenager . I knew only what I could gather from his tastes : that his family had been educated , cultured , passionate . I assumed his parents had supported and indulged , up to a point , his love for music , but I also knew that this kind of family , this kind of faded scholars ' class , had suffered when the Communists came to power . And I knew that the Communist government would not look favorably upon a family who had let a son run off to the West .

Vigilantly , he fought against his memories of this house , but it could be called to mind by a simple trick of light , and it could not be forced away by sunshine or special food . My mother would have said the dead were whispering in his ear , and although I did not believe in such things , I felt afraid . It seemed there were two Mins -- an outer Min and an inner one . The outer Min looked plump with happy words and deeds ; she had the round cheeks of a woman who would bear a child , a woman whose husband filled her with tender love . The inner Min starved ; she woke in the middle of the night , then lay for hours wondering what was wrong . I wanted to call my mother , but decided against it on the excuse that it was too expensive . In reality , I did not want to admit to her that my marriage had come to this . I fell asleep ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood before her , small and sad , and she looked me over , as if counting my bones . She shook her head and beckoned me to sit with her and have a cup of tea . " One wish , " she said . " What would you see ? " I made my wish and looked down . There it was , glimmering on the cup 's round surface . I could see the simple courtyard house , similiar to many old Chinese dwellings . It had gray , slate tiles , wooden lattice windows lined with rice paper , and a small courtyard . Here was the spot where his parents liked to sit and watch the bees that lazed about his mother 's apiary ; here stood the table and bench where Tian had sat and learned his characters . I followed my vision through these rooms , absorbing every detail , every trick of light . I could feel a palpable sadness there , filtered through its walls . I knew that I was seeing Tian 's true home . Some part of him would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , underneath the furniture . I wanted to remember all the details of this vision , to create that house in this new world , but then I felt the vision fading , and the cup slipped from my hands . My cry struck the walls and echoed back . Tian knelt over me , holding my face in his hands . " Min , " he said . " Wake up . What is it ? " His voice sounded kind and tired , indifferent . I gasped , unable to hold it in , " You do n't like it here ! You 'll go home . I know you will ! " We sat through a moment of silence . " No , " he said . " I 'll never go home . " His arms loosened their hold on me . I laid my ear against his chest and listened , knowing that my blurted words had cut him and could never be taken back . I kissed him and began to comfort him in the best way I knew how . We were silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipped the inside of my thigh , and at this brief pain , I was filled with a sudden need to weep . I felt full to breaking , but I forced away my tears . I opened my eyes . A pale light lit the walls for a minute , a blink perhaps from the night 's dark eye . I glimpsed Tian 's face folded on itself , the vein that ran down his right jaw . I caught one glimpse before the pale light vanished and we were enveloped again in dark . I ran my hand over his throat . The feel of the vein -- thick and smooth , like a scar -- stayed in my fingers long afterward . ON the morning of Anna 's birth , Tian happened to be at school rehearsing for a chamber music concert . I took a taxi to the hospital and called him from the nurse 's desk , but the baby came faster than his subway from Manhattan could . An easy birth , they said , and a healthy child , a healthy girl . When I learned the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling frightened and alone , as if even in this modern world the birth of a girl-child left me vulnerable , precarious . Tian said he did n't care about the baby 's sex , as long as I had pulled through safe and sound . When the nurse left the room , he got into the hospital bed and held me , but despite this , despite the comfort of his words and hands , I could not shake my feeling . We gave her the Chinese name of Anyu , Tranquil Jade , and the American name Anna . She grew intelligent and sturdy -- a well-behaved first child . Perhaps the heavens took heed of my disappointment and produced a careful soul and body -- sound and solid , taking no chances . She did everything exactly when the Chinese rhymes declared she would , flipping over at three months , crawling at eight , teething at nine with barely a murmur . The Chinese also say that daughters take after their fathers , but whenever I looked at little Anyu I saw my own face . She had round bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neat as almonds . Early on she began watching me and Tian and everything we did , as if she were trying to hold us in her gaze , to memorize us in case of future loss . " Is n't she terribly serious for such a small child ? Does she seem happy to you ? " Tian asked one evening as we were sitting with the baby on the couch . " Of course , " I lied . " She laughs a lot when I take her to the playground . She loves to sit on the baby swings . " But I wondered if Anna had dropped out from my shadow . Perhaps she could feel the fears I took such care to hide from Tian . She looked up whenever he stood to walk across the room , and when he left the room , she watched the door . When she learned to crawl , she started to follow him to the practice room , and I would find her sitting outside its closed door . I tried to reassure her , " Baba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Baba loves you . " Sometimes my voice rang hollow , even to me . Tian taught a music theory class that met at nine in the morning . In the first few months he slept in the back bedroom while I stayed with Anyu in our room , waking every few hours to feed her and silence her infrequent cries . I felt grateful when she learned to sleep through the night , so he could rejoin me in our bed . As he had wanted , I had gone to be fitted for a diaphragm . I wondered if he had been ready for Anyu ; I could not tell . He treated her fondly , but in a detached way , as if she really belonged to me . Perhaps he felt absorbed by work , where soon promotions would be announced . He spent so much of his time at school that I had to keep him up to date by phone . " She said , Baba , ' " I reported . " She asked for you . " " She knows who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told him a month later , when he called unexpectedly , during a rehearsal break . " That 's fine , " he said . Then he added something I could n't quite hear . " What did you say ? " " I said I called to tell you I 'm coming home early today . " " Do n't you have another rehearsal ? " " Not tonight . " At five-thirty , I looked out the front window and saw him walking up the street as if pushing against a wind . Heavy shoes sounded on the stairs . I met him at the door . " Well , " he said , " I 'm glad you 're still here . I wanted to tell you my side of the story before you got wind of things . " Then he laughed , as if he had just made a clever joke , but his face was gray , his forehead set in rigid lines . " What do you mean ? " " I was passed over . ' " Carefully , he sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked as gently as I could . " It means I did n't get the job . " " That 's crazy , " I said . " They must be crazy . " I started to ask him exactly what they had said , but ate my words . I actually bit my tongue -- I felt its muscle crunch between my teeth . " They say they 're aware of how much I 'm contributing to the community and they hope that I do n't go somewhere else just yet . They 're offering me a few more years at this level . So I 'll have another chance the next time a position comes up . " " That 's good , " I said . " I 'm old ! I 'm already older than most of them . I was already too old to start a career as a performer . If I ca n't make it now , when can I make it ? " " You 're not old , " I said . But I wondered . Although his hair remained thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sometimes seen in men who had moved just barely past their prime : bewildered , as if they could not understand how the time had shifted under their feet . Hours later , while we were getting ready for bed , he confessed to me that Lydia Borgmann and a male cellist had both been given jobs . And he told me the story that had been circulating in the department . This concerned the matter of Lydia 's missing tuning fork . Almost two years ago , at Tian 's recital , a friend of Lydia 's had returned the tuning fork she had borrowed for an orchestra rehearsal . Lydia was wearing a skirt with no pockets . She had run into the lobby and slipped the tuning fork into her coat before rejoining the audience . When she returned to the coatrack after leaving the reception , the tuning fork was missing . Then a few weeks later , during chamber orchestra practice , she had seen Tian produce that very fork from his violin case . It was a special German brand , which she doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given the obvious condition of his finances . " This is ridiculous , " I said . " She obviously put her tuning fork into the wrong coat . She and I are about the same size , the coatrack was crowded , and we must both have been wearing black wool coats . How were we supposed to know that it was hers ? " " That must have been what happened , " Tian said . But his voice was bewildered and vague . He sat on the bed , confused , slowly buttoning his faded flannel pajamas . " Did you tell them ? " " Well I -- I could n't think of what to say . I was so upset . And I had forgotten how you found that fork . To make things worse , Liddy never spoke to me about it when she saw it . That happened months ago . John found out eventually , and he told me . " I remembered the way Tian had refused to get a beer after his reception . What was it that had made me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a part of the music settlement . " Did you give it back ? " " Of course . She was n't around , so I put it into her mailbox with a note . I was so upset . Maybe I should have waited and spoken to her . Maybe ... " He had buttoned his pajamas wrong and had to start again . " You need to go to school and act like nothing is wrong , tell them the story of my coat pocket as if it were a funny story . " " Maybe ... " I stared at his pale face , his fumbling fingers . " You 're not guilty ! " I cried . " Why do you look that way ? " " Maybe ... " I turned out the light , as if to shut off his thought , and got into bed . Surely the tuning fork was a small matter , but only in itself . It was their opinion of Tian that had been tarnished -- or had he misunderstood the story ? Certainly such a small thing would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More likely , I believed , it was only one matter in a series of small things -- a culmination of drinks refused and other misunderstandings . I began to understand this , yet I also knew that I would not be able to explain this to him , to make him understand . I remembered the night of Tian 's brilliant recital -- we had been so lighthearted , so happy , walking arm in arm through the sparkling street . We had inventoried our desires , caressing and counting them as if they were prayer beads . It must have been this admission of hope that had been our downfall . This great , forgetful happiness had led to what had happened . Why else would Tian have simply accepted the tuning fork as if it were a gift from heaven ? I heard again Tian 's reckless , almost angry laugh . He had wilfully forgotten that there was no such gift , that one should beware of any such gift . He had been greedy , careless . I thought of the tuning fork as it had lain in his palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're all so silly , " I said to calm him , although my heart had pushed against my ribs . I put my hand on the back of his neck . " Let 's forget about this , " I said . " You 're a harder worker and a more talented musician than any of them . It 's only jealousy . " I pulled him closer and ran my hand over his chest . " Wait , " he said . " What is it ? " " You have n't put in your --  " I smiled in what I hoped was a distracting way . " I 'm ready , " I said , " for our son . " " No , " he said . " No son . " There was a moment of silence . Suddenly I felt awkward , smiling at him like that . I lay back and drew the blanket over my breasts . " Why not ? " " We have Anyu . We do n't need any more children . " I folded my arms underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a shallow breath . " No more ? " " Musicians ca n't afford children , you know , " he said , and his voice held a light and bitter note that made me flatten into the bed . " Maybe you should have married a richer man . " That night I woke to the muffled strains of music . The music drove me out of bed and into the foyer , where the air took on the smell of human sweat . I squinted through a crack near the hinge of the door to the practice room . In the silvery beams from the skylight I saw him playing , swaying desperately , enclosed in the little room . His shoulders and arms encircled the violin and bow as if he were about to crush them . His strong fingers hit the gleaming strings with audible force . His right arm drew powerful , seemingly interminable long notes , then convulsed as he struck deep chords near the frog . I feared he might snap something by pushing too deeply into the strings . I feared he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow skittered off the strings . A single beam of light slipped down from the skylight , illuminating one wild eye . He knew I was there . He flung open the door . Did I seem as much of a stranger to my husband then as he did to me ? I imagine how he must have seen me : a frightened woman , a stranger in cheap cotton pajamas with her hair smashed from sleep . " Go to sleep , " he hissed . I hurried . I hurried back to our room and forced myself to drown in sleep before he returned . The next morning Tian left early ; he had a lesson to give at nine o'clock . I stood in the window and watched him leave , shoulders bent as if he were walking into wind . I dressed Anna in her warmest clothes and took her for a walk . The carriage bumped on the broken pavement . Clouds hung low and hid the view ; a sharp smell of snow filled the air . I had heard old women say that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose her husband . I did not believe in old women 's sayings , but as I walked along and smelled the coming snow I began to understand them . They had been shared by generations of women who lay awake in anger and confusion , trying to understand how to make their husbands happy again . " Mama , " Anna was saying . " Mama , Mama . " Guiltily , I stopped the carriage . Lately , she had begun to have specific fears ; she saw menace in ordinary things : pigeons , headlights , faces in photographs . I knelt down and wiped a tear from her face . " What is it ? " I asked . She examined my face with her small eyes and looked away . I walked faster . I pushed the carriage to a little playground several blocks from home . Anna liked the bucket swing . I placed her in the swing and noted with relief the way her eyes began to shine , her plump legs to wave . " Do you want more ? " I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher . The quiet air filled with her shrieks of joy . I knew she would be tired and cross before her nap , but I did not stop . I pushed until I made myself dizzy , but I could not throw off the weight of fear . She fell asleep on the way home . My arms were shaking as I lifted her from the carriage . I went to the closet and pulled out the cardboard box that I had not touched since Anna was born . My school papers , neatly filed away like fossil bones of my lost thoughts . I took out a folder and went through the papers , not stopping to read or try to remember . I was looking for a paper clip . When I found one I removed it quickly , tearing the page . I stuffed the folder back into the box and pushed the box back into the closet . Then I went into the bathroom and took out the round plastic case that held my diaphragm . I unbent the paper clip and made a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
