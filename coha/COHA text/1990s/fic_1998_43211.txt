Tanith Lee 's most recent books include Faces Under Water and a young adult novel that 's due out in England very shortly , Law of the Wolf Tower . Her last appearance in these pages was exactly two years ago , with her retake on the Cinderella fairy tale , " The Reason for Not Going to the Ball . " She returns now with a very different sort of story , a dark and dazzling vision of a world locked in winter for fifteen years ... <p> 1 ONCE THEY LEFT THE CITY , the driver started to talk . He went on talking during the two-hour journey , almost without pause . His name was Argenty , but the dialogue was all about his wife . She suffered from what had become known as Twilight Sickness . She spent all day in their flat staring at the electric bulbs . At night she walked out into the streets and he would have to go and fetch her . She had had frostbite several times . He said she had been lovely twenty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened . He made a few sympathetic sounds . It was as hopeless to try to communicate with the driver , Argenty , as to shut him up . Normally Argenty drove important men from the Bureau , to whom he would not be allowed to speak a word , probably not even Goodday . But Tchaikov was a minor bureaucrat . If Argenty had had a better education and more luck , he might have been where Tchaikov was . Argenty 's voice became like the landscape beyond the cindery cement blocks of the city , monotonous , inevitably irritating , depressing , useless , sad . It was the fifteenth year of winter . Now almost forty , Tchaikov could remember the other seasons of his childhood , even one long hot summer full of liquid colors and nowforgotten smells . By the time he was twelve years old , things were changing forever . In his twenties he saw them go , the palaces of summer , as Eynin called them in his poetry . Tchaikov had been twenty-four when he watched the last natural flower , sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him - as Argenty 's wife was dying , in another way . The Industrial Winter , so it was termed . The belching chimneys and the leaking stations with their cylinders of poison . The rotting hulks along the shore like deadly whales . " The doctor says she 'll ruin her eyes , staring at the lights all day , " Argenty droned on . " There 's a new drug , is n't there - " Tchaikov tried . But Argenty took no notice . Probably , when alone , he talked to himself . Beyond the car , the snowscape spread like heaps of bedclothes , some soiled and some clean . The gray ceiling of the sky bulged low . Argenty broke off . He said , " There 's the wolf factory . " Tchaikov turned his head . Against the grayness-whiteness , the jagged black of the deserted factory which had been taken over by wolves , was the only landmark . " They howl often , sound like the old machinery . You 'll hear them from the Dacha . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them running about there . " Tchaikov noted the black forms of the wolves , less black than the factory walls and gates , darting up and over the snow heaps , and away around the building . Although things did live out here , it was strange to see something alive . Then they came down the slope , the chained snow tires grating and punching , and Tchaikov saw the mansion across the plain . " The river came in here , " said Argenty . " Under the ice now . " A plantation of pine trees remained about the house . Possibly they were dead , carved out only in frozen snow . The Dacha had two domed towers , a balustraded verandah above a flight of stairs that gleamed like white glass . When the car drove up , he could see two statues at the foot of the steps that had also been kept clear of snow . They were of a stained brownish marble , a god and goddess , both naked and smiling through the brown stains that spread from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dacha , from top to bottom , three or four floors of them , in long , arched windows . But as the car growled to a halt , Argenty gave a grunt . " Look , " he said again , " look . Up there . " They got out and stood on the snow . The cold broke round them like sheer disbelief , but they knew it by now . They stared up . As happened only very occasionally , a lacuna had opened in the low cloud . A dim pink island of sky appeared , and over it floated a dulled lemon slice , dissolving , half transparent , the sun . Argenty and Tchaikov waited , transfixed , watching in silence . Presently the cloud folded together again and the sky , the sun , vanished . " I ca n't tell her , " said Argenty . " My wife . I ca n't tell her I saw the sun . Once it happened in the street . She began to scream . I had to take her to the hospital . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " said Tchaikov . He had said this before , but now for the first time Argenty seemed to hear him . " Thank you . " Argenty insisted on carrying Tchaikov 's bag to the top of the slippery , gleaming stair , then he pressed the buzzer . The door was of steel and wood , with a glass panel of octople glazing , almost opaque . Through it , in the bluish yellow light , a vast hall could just be made out , with a floor of black and white marble . A voice spoke through the door apparatus . " Give your name . " " Henrique Tchaikov . Number sixteen stroke Y. " " You 're late . " Tchaikov stood on the top step , explaining to a door . He was enigmatic . There was always a great deal of this . " The road from Kroy was blocked by an avalanche . It had to be cleared . " " All right . Come in . Mind the dog , she may be down there . " " Dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat for his gun . " It 's all right , " said Tchaikov . " They always keep a dog here . " " Why ? " said Argenty blankly . Tchaikov said , " A guard dog . And for company , I suppose . " Argenty glanced up , toward the domed towers . The walls were reinforced by black cement . The domes were tiled black , mortared by snow . After the glimpse of sun , there was again little color in their world . " Are they - is it up there ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps . " " Take care , " said Argenty surprisingly as the door made its unlocking noise . Argenty was not allowed to loiter . Tchaikov watched him get back into the car , undo the dash panel and take a swig of vodka . The car turned and drove slowly away , back across the plain . The previous curator did not give Tchaikov his name . He was a tall thin man with slicked , black hair . Tchaikov knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion , and the pamphlet of house rules . He only mentioned one , that the solarium must not be used for more than one hour per day ; it was expensive . He asked if Tchaikov had any questions , wanted to see anything . Tchaikov said it would be fine . They met the dog in the corridor outside the ballroom , near where Ouperin located what he called his office . She was a big dog , perhaps part Cuvahl and part Husky , muscular and well-covered , with a thick silken coat like the thick pile carpets , ebony and fawn , with white round her muzzle and on her belly and paws , and two gold eyes that merely slanted at them for a second as she galloped by . " Dog ! Here , dog ! " Ouperin called , but she ignored him , prancing on , with balletic shakes of her fringed fur , into the ballroom , where the crystal chandeliers hung down twenty feet on ropes of bronze . " She only comes when she 's hungry . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes out a lot , " said Ouperin . " Her door 's down in the kitchen . Electronic . Nothing else can get in . " They visited the cold room , which was very long , and massively shelved , behind a sort of airlock . The room was frigid , the natural weather was permitted to sustain it . The ice on high windows looked like armor . Ouperin took two bottles of vodka , and a bunch of red grapes , frozen peerless in a wedge of ice . They sat in his office , along from the ballroom . A fire blazed on the hearth . " I wo n't say I 've enjoyed it here , " said Ouperin . " But there are advantages . There are some - videos and magazines in the suite . You know what I mean . Apart from the library . If you get ... hot . " Tchaikov nodded politely . Ouperin said , " The first thing you 'll do , when I go . You 'll go up and look at them , wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , " said Ouperin , " you get bored with them . At first , they remind you of the fairy story , what is it ? The princess who sleeps . Then , you just get bored . " Tchaikov said nothing . They drank the vodka , and at seventeen hours , five o'clock , as the white world outside began to turn glowing blue , a helicopter came and landed on the plain . Ouperin took his bags and went out to the front door of the Dacha , and the stair . " Have some fun , " he said . He ran sliding down the steps and up to the helicopter . He scrambled in like a boy on holiday . It rose as it had descended in a storm of displaced snow . When its noise finally faded through the sky , Tchaikov heard the wolves from the wolf factory howling over the slopes . The sky was dark blue now , navy , without a star . If ever the moon appeared , the moon was blue . The pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's winds had scoured off the snow . They were alive . But soon the snow began to come down again , to cover them . Tchaikov returned to the cold room . He selected a chicken and two steaks and vegetables , and took them to the old stone-floored kitchen down the narrow steps . The new kitchen was very small , a little bright cubicle inside the larger one . He put the food into the thawing cabinet , and then set the program on the cooker . The dog came in as he was doing this , and stood outside the lighted box . Once they had thawed , he put the bloody steaks down for her on a dish , and touched her ruffed head as she bent to eat . She was a beautiful dog , but wholly uninterested in him . She might be there in case of trouble , but there never would be trouble . No one stayed longer than six or eight months . The curatorship at the Dacha was a privilege , and an endurance test . When his meal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and ate , with the television showing him in color the black and white scenes of the snow and the cities . The card room fire burned on its synthetic logs , the gas cylinder faintly whistling . He drank vodka and red wine . Sometimes , in spaces of sound , he heard the wolves . And once , looking from the ballroom , he saw the dog , lit by all the windows , trotting along the ice below the pines . AT MIDNIGHT , when the television stations were shut down to conserve power , and most of the lights in the cities , although not here , would be dimmed , Tchaikov got into the manually operated elevator , and went up into the second dome , to the top floor . He had put on again his greatcoat , his hat and gloves . The elevator stopped at another little airlock . Beyond , only the coldpressure lights could burn , glacial blue . Sometimes they blinked , flickered . An angled stair led to a corridor , which was wide , and shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor was an annex and the two broad high doors of glass . It was possible to look through the glass , and for a while he stood there , in the winter of the dome , staring in like a child . It had been and still was a bedroom , about ten meters by eleven . His flat in the city would fit easily inside it . The bedroom had always been white , the carpets and the silken drapes , even the tassels had been a mottled white , like milk , edged with gilt . And the bed was white . So that now , just as the snow-world outside resembled a white tumbled bed , the bed was like the tumbled snow . The long windows were black with night , but a black silvered by ice . Ice had formed too , in the room , in long spears that hung from the ceiling , where once a sky had been painted , a sky-blue sky with rosy clouds , but they had darkened and died , so now the sky was like old gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors in the room had cracked from the cold and formed strange abstract patterns that seemed to mean something . Even the glass doors had cracked , and were reinforced . From here you could not properly see the little details of the room , the meal held perfect under ice , the ruined ornaments and paintings . Nor , properly , the couple on the bed . Tchaikov drew the electronic key from his pocket and placed it in the mechanism of the doors . It took a long time to work , the cold-current not entirely reliable . The lighting blinked again , a whole second of black . Then the doors opened and the lights steadied , and Tchaikov went through . The carpet , full of ice crystals , crunched under his feet , which left faint marks that would dissipate . His breath was smoke . On a chest with painted panels , where the paint had scattered out , stood a white statue , about a meter high , that had broken from the cold , and an apple of rouged glass that had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls were done for . Here and there , a half of a face peeped out from the mossy corrosion , like the sun he had seen earlier in the cloud . Hothouse roses in a vase had turned to black coals , petrified , petals not fallen . Their meal stood on the little mosaic table . It had been a beautiful meal , and neatly served . An amber fish , set with dark jade fruits , a salad that had blackened like the roses but kept its shape of dainty leaves and fronds . A flawless cream round , with two slivers cut from it , reminding him of the quartering of an elegant clock . The champagne was all gone , but for the beads of palest gold left at the bottom of the two goblets rimmed with silver . The bottle of tablets was mostly full . They had taken enough only to sleep , then turned off the heating , leaving the cold to do the rest . The Last Supper of Love , Eynin had called it , in his poem , " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at them . The man , Xander , wore evening dress , a tuxedo , a silk shirt with a tunic collar . On the jacket were pinned two military ribbons and a Knight 's Cross . His tawny hair was sleeked back . His face was grave and very strong , a very masculine face , a very clean , calm face . His eyes , apparently , were green , but invisible behind the marble lids . She , the woman , Tamura , was exquisite , not beautiful but immaculate , and so delicate and slender . She could have danced on air , just as Eynin said , in her sequined pumps . Her long white dress clung to a slight and nearly adolescent body , with the firm full breasts of a young woman . Herbrunette hair spread on the pillows with the long stream of pearls from her neck . On the middle finger of her left hand , she wore a burnished ruby the color and size of a cherry . Like Xander , Tamura was calm , quite serene . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last meal , drinking their wine , perhaps making love . Then swallowing the pills and lying back for the sleep of winter , the long cold that encased and preserved them like perfect candy in a globe of ice . They had been here nine years. , It was not so very long . Tchaikov looked at them . After a few minutes he turned and went back across the room , and again his footmarks temporarily disturbed the carpet . He locked the doors behind him . In the curator 's suite below , he put on the ordinary dimmed yellow lamp , and read Eynin 's poem again , sipping black tea , while the synthetic fire crackled at the foot of his hard bed . We watched the summer palaces Sail from this place , Like liners to the sea Of yesterday . Tchaikov put the book aside and switched off the light and fire . The fire died quite slowly , as if real . Outside he heard the wolves howling like the old factory machinery . Behind his closed eyelids , he saw Tamura 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite florist 's shops of the city . Her eyes , apparently , were dark . Above him , as he lay on his back , the lovers slept on in their bubble of loving snow . 2 The first month was not eventful . Each day , Henrique Tchaikov made a tour of the Dacha , noting any discrepancies , a fissure in the plaster , a chipped tile , noises in the pipes of the heating system-conscious , rather , of the fissured plaster and tiles , the thumps of the radiators , in his own apartment building . He replaced fuses and valves . In the library he noted the books which would need renovation . And took a general inventory of the stores the house had accumulated . Every curator did this . Evidently , some items were overlooked . The books , for example , the cornice in the ballroom , while lavatory tissue and oil for the generator were regularly renewed . He used the hot tub , but only every three or four days . In the city , bathing was rationed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except once a week to check the thermostat and to water the extraordinary black-green plants which rose in storeys of foliage to the roof . Most of the afternoon he sat reading in the library , or listening to the music machine . He heard , for the first time , recordings of Prokofiev and Rachmaninov playing inside their own piano concertos , and Shostakovich conducting his own symphony , and Lirabez singing , in a slightly flat but swarthy baritone , a cycle of his own songs . For those who liked these things , the Dacha provided wonderful experiences . Tchaikov also watched films , and the recordings of historical events . Sometimes in the mornings he slept an hour late , letting the coffeeplate prepare a sticky brew , with thick cream from the cold room . Usually he kept in mind these treats were his only for eight months at the most , less than a year . Then he would have to go back . The dog became more sociable , though not exactly friendly . He stroked her fur , even brushed her twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beautiful . Probably this was not the right thing , as again , when he left , some other person would be the curator , who might not even like dogs . Bella , the dog , each evening lay before the fire in the card room , sometimes even in the suite . But normally she would only stay an hour or two . Then she wanted to go down through the house and out by the electronic dog-door . He began to realize that the wolf howling was often very close to the mansion . At last he saw the indigo form of a wolf on the night snow . The wolf howled on and on , until the dog went out . Then the wolf and the dog played together in the snow . The first time he saw this , Tchaikov was assailed by a heart wringing pang of hope . The house manual told him that the wolves had invaded the factory , and remained there , because they lived off the rats which still infested it . The rats in turn lived off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinely inspired cycle . Bella and the wolf must have met out upon the frozen ice of the ancient river buried below the Dacha and the pines . Although there would be females of the wolf kind for the wolf to choose from , instead he took to Bella . An individualist . Tchaikov did not see them join in the sexual act , but he accepted that they too were lovers . This seemed to symbolize the vigor still clinging in the threatened world , its basic tenacity , its magic . But he put such thoughts aside . Magic was illusion . Sex was only that , just like the " hot " magazines Ouperin , or someone , had secreted in the suite , and which Tchaikov did not bother with . For him , sensuality was connected to personality . He preferred memory to invention . Of course , occasionally he pondered Tamura and Xander , their intrinsic meaning . But never for long . And he did not go up again to look at them . IN THE FIRST DAY of the second month , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party would be arriving at midday . He shut the dog Bella in the kitchen , and put on his suit and tie . At sixteen hours , or four o'clock - they were late , another avalanche - the party drew up in two big buses with leviathan snow tires . Tchaikov understood he was unreasonably resentful at the stupid intrusion , for which the place was intended . He wanted the Dacha to himself . But he courteously welcomed the party , twenty-three people , who stared about the hall with wide , red-rimmed eyes , their noses running , because the heating in the buses was not very good . They had their own guide , who led them , following Tchaikov , up the stairs to the manually operated lift . Tchaikov and the guide took them in two groups of eleven and twelve up into the dome . They seemed frightened on the narrow stair , and in the corridor , as though extreme cold still unsettled  --  startled - them . They peered through the glass doors , exactly as Tchaikov had . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered about the bedroom . Told not to touch anything , they made tactile motions in the air over ornaments and furnishings , with their gloved hands . One woman , seeing the lovers , Tamura , Xander , on the bed , began to cry . No one took any notice . She pulled quantities of paper handkerchiefs from her pocket ; possibly she had come prepared for emotion . Downstairs in the ballroom , the guide lectured everybody on the Dacha . They stood glassy-eyed and blank . The significance of Tamura and Xander was elusive but overpowering . Tchaikov too did not listen . Instead he organized the coffee-plate in the card room , and brought the party coffee in relays , laced with vodka , before its return to the city in the two drafty buses . When they had gone , about six , Bella was whining from the kitchen . He fed her quickly , knowing she wanted to be off to her lover . He gave her that night two extra steaks , in case she should want to take them out as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly , from this , he deduced she would eventually desert the Dacha for her wolf partner . Instinctively she knew not to accustom him to extra food , and to prepare herself for future hardship . But doubtless this was fanciful . Besides , she might by now be pregnant with the wolf 's children . Bella lay before the synthetic log fire , her gold eyes burning goldenred . Her belly looked more full than it had . It was about twenty-two hours , ten o'clock . Tchaikov read aloud to her from the poem " This Place . " I dreamed once , of this place . When I was young . But then I woke When I was young . It was five nights since the bus party had visited . Once the dog had got up , shaken herself , and padded from the room , Tchaikov went upstairs and stepped into the elevator . The night was extra cold , minus several more degrees on the gauge , and the great bedroom had a silvery fog in it . He could look at the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man and a woman who had not wanted to remain inside the sinking winter world . But was it merely that ? Was their mystical suicide cowardice - or bravura ? Did they think , in dying , that they had somewhere warm to go ? The Bureau had not advanced any records on them , and probably their names were not even those they had gone by in life : Again , he asked himself what they meant . But it did not really matter . They were , that was all . In the night , about four A.M. , an unearthly noise woke him from a deep sleep , where he had been dreaming of swimming in a warm sea jeweled by fish . The sound had occurred outside , he thought , outside both the dream and the room . He got up and went to the window , and looked out through the triple glazing which was all the suite provided . The snowscape spread from the pines , along the plain , and in the distance billowed up to the higher land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars . Far away to the right , where the plain was its most level and long , a black mark had appeared in the snow .. It must stretch for nearly twenty meters , he thought , a jagged , ink-black crack in the terrain . Tchaikov stared , and saw a vapor rising out of the crack , caused by the disparity between the bitter set of the air and some different temperature below . The sound had been a crack . Like a gigantic piece of wood snapped suddenly in half - a bark of breakage . But new snow was already drifting faintly down from the stars , smoothing and obscuring the black tear in the whiteness . As Tchaikov watched , it began to vanish . Probably it was nothing . In the city apertures sometimes appeared in the top-snow of streets , where thermolated pipes still ran beneath . Somebody had told Tchaikov there had been a river here , passing below the house . The driver had mentioned it too . Perhaps the disturbance had to do with that . Tchaikov went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tensed . Then he recalled that once , in his early childhood , he had heard such a crack roar out across a frozen lake in the country . Instinctively , hearing it now , he had unconsciously remembered the springs of long-ago , the waxing of the sun , the rains , the melting of the ice . But spring was forever over . He drifted back down into sleep , numb and calm . The next morning , as he was coming from the solarium , having switched off the sprinklers , he heard the sound of a vehicle on the plain . He went into the ballroom and looked down at the snow , half noticing as he did so that the curious mark of the previous night had completely disappeared . A large black car was now parked by the Dacha 's steps , near the statues . After a moment , Tchaikov recognized the car which had brought him here . Puzzled , he waited , and saw the driver , Argenty , get out , and then a smaller figure in a long coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Argenty pausing for the smaller figure , which was that of a woman . After a minute the house door made a noise . There had been no communication from the city computer , but sometimes messages were delayed . In any case , you could not leave them standing in the cold . Tchaikov opened the door without interrogation . Argenty shot him a quick look under his hat . " It 's all right , is n't it ? " " I expect so , " said Tchaikov . He let them come in , and the door shut . Argenty took off his hat , and stood almost to attention . He said , " There are n't visitors due , are there ? " " Not that I know of . " " I thought not . There 's been another power failure . I should n't think anyone would be going anywhere today . " " Apart from you . " " Yes , " said Argenty . He turned , and looked at the woman . She too had taken off her hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a small pale slender face , without , he thought , any makeup beyond a dusting of powder . Her eyes were dark and smoky , with long lashes of a lighter darkness . Her dark hair seemed recently washed and brushed and fell in soft waves to her shoulders . Just under her right cheekbone had been applied a little diamant6 flower . She met his eyes and touched the flower with a gloved fingertip . She said quietly , " A frostbite scar . " " This is my wife , " said Argenty . " Tanya . " Then she smiled at Tchaikov , a placating smile , like a child 's when it wants to show it is undeserving of punishment . She was like a child , a girl , despite the two thin lines cut under her large eyes and at either side of her soft mouth . He remembered how Argenty had talked on and on about her , her light-deprived Twilight Sickness , her wanderings in the night and cries . She had been lovely , he said , twenty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should not be here . It could cost Argenty a serious demotion . What had happened ? The power failure ? The electricity off in their flat , gloom , and the refrigerator failing , and Argenty saying , Leave all that , I 'll take you somewhere nice . As you might , to stop a miserable and frightened child crying . Tchaikov said , " Come into the card room . There 's a fire . " They went through with him , Argenty still stiff and formal , absolutely knowing what he had risked , but she was all smiles now , reassured . In the warm room , Argenty removed his greatcoat , and helped her off with her fur . Tchaikov looked at them , slightly surprised . Argenty wore the uniform of his city service , with an honor ribbon pinned by the collar . While she - she wore a long , old evening gown of faded pastel crimson , which left her shoulders and arms and some of her white back and breast bare . On her left hand , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She indicated it again at once , laughed and said , " Frostbite . I 've been careless , you see . " Tchaikov switched on the coffee-plate . He said , " I usually have lunch in about an hour . I hope you 'll join me . " Argenty nodded politely . She began to walk about the room , inspecting the antique oil paintings and the restored damask wall covering . Argenty took out a brand of expensive cigarettes and came to Tchaikov , offering them . Argenty murmured , very low , " Thank you , for being so good . I ca n't tell you what it means to her . " " That 's all right . You may even get away with it , if the computer 's out . " Argenty shrugged . " Perhaps . What does it matter anyway ? " After the coffee , Tchaikov showed them the ballroom , then went to organize a lunch . He selected caviar and pork , the type of vegetables and little side dishes he did not , himself , bother with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would like . He took vodka and two bottles of champagne from the liquor compartment . For God 's sake , they might as well enjoy the visit . He opened up the parlor off the ballroom . It too had a chandelier dripping prisms . He turned on the fire and lit the tall white candles in the priceless candelabra . He was not supposed to do this . But against Argenty 's tremendous gamble it was a small gesture . Everything sparkled in the room . It was now only like an overcast snowy winter day in the country . Perhaps before some festival . And the lunch was like a celebration . Argenty ate doggedly , drank quite sparingly . She ate only a little , but with interest , excitement . She sparkled up like the room , her personal lights switched on . In the middle of the meal , the dog , Bella , came padding in , her coat thick with rime and water drops . Tchaikov got up , thinking Tanya would be afraid of the dog . But Tanya only laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fur , and drying her inadequately with linen napkins from the table . As Bella stood before the fire , and the slight woman made a fuss of her , Tchaikov could see the swelling shape of the dog 's belly , her extended nipples . She was definitely pregnant from the wolf . And the girl-woman bent shining over her , caressing and stroking , kissing the big animal on the savage velvet of her brow . Argenty said , " Tanya used to live on a farm . They had dogs , cats , horses , everything . " Tanya said , lightly , " I came to the city to sell stockings . Is n't that ridiculous . " When the meal was finished , they drew the large chairs to the fireside . They sat drinking coffee and brandy , and the dog lay between them , glistening gold along her back from the fire . Outside , the dusk of the afternoon seemed only seasonal through the openings of the heavy drapes . They were sleepy , muttering little anecdotes of their pasts , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asleep , her head gracefully drooping , a lock of her hair like dark tinsel on her cheek . " When she wakes up , " said Argenty , " we 'll be going . " " Why do n't you stay tonight ? " said Tchaikov . " Leave early in the morning . There 's another bedroom in the suite . Quite a good one-I think it 's for visiting VIPS . By tomorrow the power failure will be over , probably . " " That 's kind ... you 've been kind ... but we 'd better get back . " They looked at the sleeping woman , at the sleeping dog , and the fire . " Why did this happen ? " asked Argenty . His voice was gentle and unemphatic . " Could n't they have seen - why did they give up all the best things , let them go - they could have - something - surely - " Tchaikov said nothing , and Argenty fell silent . And in the silence there came a dense low rumble . For a moment Tchaikov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , and then , as it grew louder , for the noise of snow dislodged and tumbling from a roof of the mansion . But then the rumbling became very loud , running in toward them over the plain . " What is it ? " said Argenty . He had gone pale . " I do n't know . An earth tremor , perhaps . " The rumbling was now so vehement he had to raise his voice . On the table the silver and the glasses tinkled and rattled , something fell and broke , and on the walls the pictures trembled and swayed . The floor beneath their chairs was churning . The dog had woken , sat up , her coat bristling and ears laid flat , a white ring showing round each eye . Argenty and Tchaikov rose , and in her sleep the woman stretched out one hand , in its lace glove , as if to snatch hold of something . Then came a thunderclap , a sort of ejection of sound that ripped splintering from earth and sky , hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous echoing shards . The windows grated and shook . No doubt some of the external glass had ruptured . " Is it a bomb ? " cried Argenty . Tanya had started from sleep and the chair , and he caught her in his arms . She was speechless with shock and terror . The-dog was growling . " I do n't know . It 's stopped now . Not a bomb , I think . There was no light flash . " Tchaikov moved to the door . " Stay here . " Outside , he ran across the ballroom , and to the nearer window which looked out to the plain . What he saw made him hesitate mentally , stumble in his mind , at a loss . He could not decipher what he was looking at . It was a sight theoretically familiar enough . Yet knowing what it was , he stood immobile for several minutes , staring without comprehension at the enormous coal-black dragon which had crashed upward through the dead ice of the frozen river , showering off panes of the marble land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed building . In the puddle of bubbling iron water , the submarine settled now , tall , motionless , less than thirtyfive meters beyond the Dacha , while clouds of stony steam rose in a tumult on the steel sky . 3 THEY MARCHED STEADILY to the mansion , over the snow . Henrique Tchaikov watched them come , black shapes on the whiteness . Reaching the steps , they climbed them , and arrived at the door . He could see their uniforms by then , the decorations of rank and authority . They did not seem to feel the cold . They did not bother with the buzzer . He spoke through the door apparatus . " You must identify yourselves . " " You 'll let us in . " The one who spoke then gave a key word and number . And Tchaikov opened the door . The cold gushed in with them , in a special way . " You 're the current Bureau man , " said the commander to Tchaikov . He was about thirty-six , athletic , tanned by a solarium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . His teeth were winter white . " We wo n't give you much trouble . We 've come for the couple . " Tchaikov did not answer . His heart kicked , but it was a reflex . He stood very still . He had taken Tanya and Argenty down to the kitchen , with the dog , and shut them all in . The commander vocalized again . " We do n't need any red tape , do we ? My men will go straight up . It 'll only take the briefest while . The dome , " Are those the names ? Yes . The pair in the state bedroom . Here 's the cov said slowly , " You mean Tamura and Xander . " " Are accepted the disc ames ? Yes . The put it in the state bedroom . Here 's the door . confirmation affirmative lit up , the key number , and the little message : Comply with v accepted conditions . The disc and put it in the analyzer by the dook back his disc . After ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he key number , and " without our machines . " Then he little an message : Comply with all conditions . The command the four other men ran off and up took stair , like his let from a leash , toward there upper floors and we be , " he said , " without our machines . " Then he gave been order , and the four other men ran off and with the stair , like hout of the mansion . Tchaikov saw that two of from carried each a leash , toward the upper floors and the elevator . Obviously they would have been means of with the layout of the mansion . Tchaikov saw that two of them He said , " Why are you taking each a rolled ray ? Where are thermolated bag . They would have some means of opening the commander showed all his pristine , repulsive teeth . " Quite a comfortable said , " Why are you taking them away ? Where , I 'd say , yes ? Do n't worry , they wo n't recall you until your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his to go . You can just repulsive teeth . " Quite a comfortable stint here , I 'd say , yes ? Do n't would be useless to question they wo n't recall you until further . He had had his orders , which were time 's up . Messes up the files . Seven months to go . You can just relax . " Tchaikov grasped it would be useless take them into question the submarine , go away with them , somewhere . further . He had had his orders , whichaikov said , " It were to remove the way you surfrozen lovers in cold-bat river , take them into the submarine , go away with them , somewher , " it runs deep , So far down , you Tchaikov said , " It was impressive , the water still moves . We came in from the sea , thirteen kilomed . " " That have giver , " said the commander , " it runs deep . So far down , you a surprise . " know , the water still moves . We came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you a surprise . " " yes . " " There 's nothing like her , " said the commander , as though he boasted about a selected woman , or his mother . " The X 2 M 's . Ice-breakers , powerhives . Worlds in themselves . You 'd be amazed . We could stay under for a hundred years . We have everything . Clean reusable air , foolproof heating , cuisine prepared by master chefs , games rooms , weaponry . See how brown I am , " he added , dancing his narrow eyes , flirting now . " Have you ever tasted eggs ? " " No . " " I have one every day . And fresh meat . Salads . My little boat has everything I 'll ever need . " There was a wooden , flat sound , repeated on and on . The commander frowned . " It 's only the dog , " Tchaikov said . " I shut her in , below . In case she annoyed you . " " Dog ? Oh , yes . Animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tchaikov thought he heard the lift cranking up the tower , going to the dome . The commander looked about now , and laughed at the old regal house , the old country Dacha with its sleeping , white-candy dead . Then stood in silence in the hall , until the other four men ran down again , carrying , not particularly cautiously , the two thermolated bags , upright and unpliable . Filled and out of the dome , the material had misted over . Tchaikov could not see Tamura or Xander in these cocoons , although he found himself staring , thinking for a second he caught the scorch of her ruby ring . " Well done , " the commander said to him . " All over . " It was like the dentists in childhood . " You can go back to all those cozy duties . " He grinned at Tchaikov . But his use of jargon was somehow unwieldy and out of date . Did they speak another tongue on the submarine ? " A nice number . Happy days . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men out . Tchaikov watched them returning over the snow , toward their black dragon-whale . Already the ice was forming round the submarine 's casing , but that would not be much of an inconvenience . He wondered where they had been , how far out in jet black seas , where maybe fish still swam . When the vessel was gone , the ice would swiftly close , and tonight 's fresh snowfall heal the wound it had made as snow had healed the preface to the wound , last night . Tamura and Xander , preserved from the submarine 's warmth in some refrigerated cubicle . He did not know , could not imagine for what purpose . Although the nagging line from some book - was it a Bible- began to twitter in his head ... And He said : Make thee an ark Above , the dome was void . The great polar room with its stalactites of ice , the footsteps already smoothing from the carpet . He descended quickly to the kitchen . He had told Argenty where the medicine cabinet was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tchaikov was unsure what he would find . Yet when he reached the lower floor , there was only quietness . Opening the kitchen door , he found the two of them seated urbanely at the long table . The dog Bella had gone . But Tanya sat in her red dress , and looking up , she met Tchaikov only with her lambent eyes . She said to him , reciting from memory from Eynin 's poem that he too knew so well : In HelD the birds are made of fire ; If all the birds of Hell flew to this place , And settled on the snow , Still darkness would prevail , And utter cold . " She knows it by heart , " said Argenty . " So do I , most of it , " Tchaikov answered . " The dog went out , " said Argenty . " We thought we heard a wolf . " " Yes . They 've mated . " The kitchen was bathed in vague ochre heat , only the light of the new cooking area was raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were very good , to hide us away . " " It 's all right , " he said . " The military are shortsighted . They came for something else . " In a while they heard the strange , sluggish hollow suction of the submarine , its motors , diving down again below the ice . The house gave now only a little shudder , and on its shelf one ancient plate turned askew . Tanya laughed . She lifted her dark springy hair in her hands . Tchaikov saw that Argenty 's hair , under the polishing light , was a rich dull gold . He slept a deep leaden sleep , and dreamed of the submarine . It was taller than the tallest architecture of the city , the Bureau building . It clove forward , black , ice and steam **27;1366;TOOLONG from it , rending the land with a vicious hull like the blade of some enormous ice-skate . In the dark sky above , red and yellow burning birds wheeled to and fro , cawing and calling , striking sparks from the clouds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dacha , it stopped just outside the wall of the suite , which in the dream was made of glass . The wall shattered and fell down , and looking up the mile of iron , steel and night that was the tower of the submarine , Tchaikov noticed a tiny bluish porthole set abnormally in the side , and there they sat , the lovers , gazing down with cold , closed eyes . Waking , he got up and made black tea on the plate . From the other bedroom of the suite , across the inner room , came no sound . When he looked out , there was no longer a light beneath their door . If they had switched off the optional lamp , perhaps they slept . When the afternoon darkened , they had sat on with him in the kitchen , drinking a little , talking idly . There was the subtle ease of remaining ; he realized before Argenty asked , that they did after all mean to stay a night at the house . Later the dog came in again . Tchaikov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour before going out once more . During the interval , Tanya suddenly sang a strange old song in her light girl 's voice , " Oh my dog is such a clever dog - " Bella listened . Her tail wagged slowly . She came to Tanya to be caressed before padding off into the star-spiked night . They ate cold pork and bread for supper and finished the champagne . Argenty thanked Tchaikov , shaking his hand , throwing his arm around him . The girl-woman did not kiss Tchaikov as he had half expected hoped ? - she would . She only said shyly , " It 's been a wonderful day . Better than a birthday . " By the time he concluded his nocturnal check of the Dacha , they had gone up , and just the lamp showed softly under the door . But they were in full darkness now , so Tchaikov walked almost on tiptoe from the suite . He did not want to wake them if they slept . He wished her not to dream as he had , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed over again . Snow fell in gentle pitiless flakes . The elevator seemed particularly sluggish . He had to work at the lever with great firmness . Above , in the icy corridor , Tchaikov shivered , only his trousers and greatcoat on over his nightshirt . As he walked toward the glass doors , he had a sense of imminence . What was it ? Was it loss ? As formerly , he hesitated , and stood at the doors , staring in through the glacial light , the glacial glass , the cracks , the fog of ice . He experienced a moment of dislocation , pure bewilderment , just as he had with the submarine . He had previously seen the bed clothed by two forms . Now they were removed and the bed was vacant . But there were two forms on the bed . The bed was clothed . Tchaikov opened the doors with the electronic key they had so noiselessly replaced on the chest in his room , before going up again . Of course , the key , lying there , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the card room . There would have been no difficulty in deciding . The bedroom , when he entered it now , did not strike him as so frozen . The breath of the living seemed finally to have stirred it , like the fluid of the deepest coldest pool , stirred by a golden wand . Tchaikov went across to the bed . Two bottles had fallen on the thick carpet . He looked down , at the couple . They lay hand in hand , side by side . Their faces were peaceful , almost smiling , the eyes fast shut . Like the faces , the eyes , of Xander and Tamura . Yet these two lovers had needed to be brave . Despite the vodka they had swallowed and the tablets from the medicine cabinet , they had had to face the cold , had had to lie down in the cold . He in his well-brushed uniform with its single honor , and she in her pale red sleeveless gown . But there had been no struggle . They seemed to have found it very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been easy , too . Her somber hair , his gilded hair , both smoked now by the rime . And on the diamant6 flower that gemmed her cheek , a single mote of crystal like a tear . Tchaikov backed slowly and carefully away . It was possible they were not quite dead yet , still in the process of dying . He tiptoed out , not to disturb their death . By the end of the ninth month , when the Bureau at last recalled him , the dog was long gone . He had seen her at first sometimes , out on the snow , playing with the wolf and their three pups . But the wolf was a king wolf , made her queen over the wolf pack , and in the end , she went away to the factory with them . When he heard the howling in the still night , he thought of her . Once , the moon appeared incredibly for a quarter of an hour , sapphire blue , and the wolves " chanting rose to a crescendo . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male and such a well-nourished mother . His faxed report had been acknowledged , but that was all . Tchaikov never commented upon or thought about the aspects of what had occurred , he detailed and visualized the events only in memorized images . The night of the blue moon , which was two nights before his return to the city , and to his cramped flat with its thudding radiators , the tepid bath once a week , the rationing , the dark , he wrote in the back of the book of Eynin 's poetry , on the blank page which followed the poem called " The Place . " Here too he set out the facts sparely , as he had done for the Bureau . Under the facts he wrote a few further lines . " I have puzzled all this time over what is their meaning , the lovers in the ice , whoever they are , whether right or wrong in their action , and even if they change , their bodies constantly taken and replaced by others . And I think their meaning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human spirit , still blooming , always blooming , like the last flower in the winter world . "
