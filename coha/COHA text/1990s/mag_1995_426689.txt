The breakup of a family is a heart-wrenching experience , but once the decision is made , sound advice can help you survive the legal and emotional complexities . <p> " I always say a girl must get married for love , " Zsa Zsa Gabor once said , " and just keep on getting married until she finds it . " <p> Eight marriages later , we hope she finally did . <p> Zsa Zsa 's marriages provided material for two generations of comedians , including Milton Berle , who wrote : " Every woman in Beverly Hills is wondering what to get her husband for Christmas . Zsa Zsa Gabor is wondering what husband to get for Christmas . " <p> Strange as it may seem to today 's newlyweds , Zsa Zsa was an exception to the rule in generations past . For most couples , promises made at the church altar in days of old included the line " till death do you part . " Stranger still , the couples who said ' yes ' to that promise did n't have their fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of weathered , handholding couples celebrating their 50th , 60th , even 70th wedding anniversaries . <p> The long-lasting unions serve as verification that through thick and thin , rain , sleet , snow , fog , and dark of night , true love and growing respect are the things that have bound them through the decades , and that the years of love and struggles were truly worth it ! <p> Sadly , today 's statistics show that some states report as many divorces filed annually as wedding licenses applied for . The numbers , of course , do not include the couples who play at marriage without bothering to apply for a license  --  an arrangement that spares the trauma and expense of a divorce when he forgets to come home , or he remembers to come home , only to find a " Dear John " note propped against the cappuccino machine . <p> While divorce may make careers for comedians , in reality divorce is often a painful and lonely situation for all involved , famous or not , rich or poor . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of my marriages , " billionaire J. Paul Getty once said . " I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success . " <p> Unfortunately , there are some relationships that can not be salvaged for whatever reasons . The difficult decision to end the relationship has been made . Now the formal and complicated process of divorce begins . Should I Get a Lawyer ? <p> Absolutely . One of the famous lies in our trade is , " You wo n't need a lawyer ; mine will take care of both of us . " That goes right along with " do n't worry about anything , dear ; you can trust me . I 'll take care of you . " The fact that you get a lawyer does not mean that you still can not work everything out . A good divorce lawyer will know the best marriage counselors who can help in reconciliation where children are involved . <p> But if divorce is inevitable , there are many little quirks in today 's laws , from the federal benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no question that you should have someone point these out to you . <p> Some writers advise always getting an estimate of a lawyer 's fee before retaining him , but in divorce this is nearly impossible . The fee will depend on how many times you will be in court , how many depositions are needed , and whether there are interviews of witnesses in custody or evaluation matters . The best way to protect yourself is to get a written contract , with set hourly rates and a list of probable additional expenses , such as photocopy costs , long-distance calls , depositions , and outside appraisers and experts ' fees . Insist on a monthly bill , broken down by the hour and itemized . In this way , after a month or two with copies of the various pieces of correspondence and pleadings , you will be able to tell whether your lawyer is working , and you will have an excellent handle on costs . <p> Do some lawyers cheat on their time records ? You bet . I know one lawyer who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were added up . <p> In one case where I represented the husband , the wife failed to follow the outline I 've set out above . It was months before she got a bill from her lawyer , and when she did , it was a shocker . When she called to ask my advice , I refused to talk to her at first , even though the divorce was over . However , she persisted . When I finally took her call , I told her that , ethically , I could n't discuss the fee matter with her . She said I had to because it involved ethics , and she felt that she was being swindled . All she wanted me to tell her was whether her lawyer 's representations about telephone calls and conferences with me were accurate . I agreed to go that far , taking out my detailed bill and comparing what her lawyer 's bill showed by way of contrast . The comparison was astounding , and it led directly to the wife filing a grievance with the Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records reflected no conference and no telephone call , his records reported more than an hour involved with me in discussing the case . <p> If you do n't have a lawyer ( preferably one obtained by recommendations of his or her former clients ) , you may fall for some tricks of the trade . For example , in many states , it is not necessary for a party to disclose all of his or her assets . To determine them , you must either file interrogatories , take a deposition , or get the party under oath in some way as to his or her assets and liabilities . If you do n't , you stand in eminent peril of missing anything from a stock account to a pension . <p> One common divorce trick is to hide assets from a spouse . Once when I suspected one of my clients of doing this , I queried him about it . " Do you know where Cambridge City is ? " he asked . After my negative response , he said , " Neither does my wife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 miles away . <p> Another trick , which a lawyer might well catch for you , is the pattern of payment of business debts . The parties often enter into " divorce planning . " When doing this , they realize , as one of my clients quickly observed , " if my business is the tail that wags the dog in this marital pot , and I am going to get the business , I had better reduce some of my business debt . I 'll just take those municipal bonds that ! have , which the court would award to my wife , to offset the value of the business , and I 'll reduce business debt . Then , I 'll have to pay my wife over a period of time because there wo n't be enough cash in the pot to make an equal division . " He was right ; she got the house , stock account , the motor home , jewelry , and furniture , and he got his exotic car and his business . He owed her money , but had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , she got hers over time , much to her chagrin . Watch Those Assets and Liabilities <p> The lines on a balance sheet in a marital estate can be very misleading . Ten thousand dollars in cash , in stocks , or in pension dollars may appear to be the same in the client 's eye , but be careful ; they probably are not . First , the pension dollars are untaxed . Depending on your age , the withdrawal of those dollars , to use them or invest them in another way , can occasion not only tax , but penalty . You will never get those pension dollars out without paying a tax . So if one spouse says , " I 'll take the cash and you can have the pension , since you do n't have one , " be careful . A dollar is not always a dollar . <p> " Surely I am safe taking stocks , " one lady said , when seeking my advice . " They are just the same as cash . " I told her not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real problems not only with the practical matter of the cost of reducing stocks to cash ( as well as the time involved ) with broker 's commissions , but we also had a problem of basis . Basis is your cost in the stock . If we were dealing with the estate , on the death of the husband , it would be the matter of a valuation date or an alternate valuation date starting with the date of the husband 's death . However , in a divorce situation , the spouse taking the stock in a dissolution takes the basis of the purchaser , thus possibly occasioning a capital gains tax at the time of sale . Generally , there is no tax on the transfer of these assets between spouses , but there certainly would be in the case of one spouse getting the stock with the lower basis and selling it at the higher price . <p> Even though most divorces occur before retirement at 65 , pension dollars can be transferred from spouse to spouse through a qualified domestic relations order ( QDRO ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan administrator of certain qualified plans . Remember , a pension can be divided or awarded as an asset on a balance sheet , or it can be divided in kind at the time the employee or spouse is eligible . It varies from pension to pension and from state to state , and it even varies with certain federal pensions . <p> A business value shown on a balance sheet can be quickly identified as book value or , with certain appraisals , adjusted book value , determined by the value of the business ' stock and other tangible assets . However , that is not always the full story . Businesses can have another value , one called goodwill , defined as the intangible , salable asset of a business as determined by its reputation and its relations with customers . In many states , any business , from the giant manufacturing corporation right down to the humble hot-dog stand operator , can build up a certain amount of goodwill . In many cases , accountants , appraisers , or investment bankers can determine goodwill of a particular business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleas of the doctor who says , " You know it is of no value if I am not there to work . " Wrong ! To accept the value of any business at book value may be allowing yourself to be cheated . Therefore , you need professional advice . <p> Other divorce tactics to watch for include : Child custody . Some parties who are not seeking custody will ask for it , or ask for joint or shared custody to intimidate a loving parent into a lower property settlement . Setting a trial date . Do n't let the other side rush you into a trial date , very early , when you are not prepared . I do n't mean to infer that every case need be or should be tried . They can be mediated ; there can be arbitration ; or you can just have an old-fashioned settlement . However , none of those things could or should occur until the parties each know the full value of the marital estate . Getting a continuance . It is a tactic that has had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the week of trail and the other spouse can not get a continuance , so he or she fires his or her lawyer on the eve of the trial to get one . Using financial leverage . When one spouse does n't have money and the other does , I have seen cases where the wealthy partner tries to break the other side financially by not agreeing to pay fees and forcing the other to run up huge bills for litigation support . Unethical experts . An older and wiser lawyer once told me , " All the whores in town are n't down on Mulberry Street . " What he was referring to are appraisers and experts who can be bought . They are the " what number do you want " group . Be very wary of your spouse 's experts and appraisers . If you have any question about a value , get it appraised yourself . Getting appraisals . A tip to the spouses who would be getting the household goods and jewelry : these items are customarily appraised in dissolution matters at " fair market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on insurance riders . It behooves you to get them appraised . They will be a real bargain . That thousand-dollar ring will probably come in at $400 . Undermining faith in your lawyer . One of the favorite tactics of litigants in a divorce is to try to undermine their estranged mate 's confidence in their counsel . It happens all the time . If you are beyond the settlement mode and getting ready for trial , remember the other party is your enemy , and your faith should be placed in your legal representative . <p> Divorce , if it happens to you , will be one of the most emotional times in your life , especially at the beginning . You may be confused , vulnerable , and prone to making many mistakes early . It is usually wise to take a trusted friend or family member with you to the first meeting with the lawyer so he or she can help you remember everything that is said and get you on the path to efficient settlement . <p> Sure , a few of those horror stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not . In thousands of divorces , I have been " fixed , " to my knowledge , twice . One of those judges is now in the federal penitentiary . For the most part , judges are honest , hardworking , underpaid people dedicated to seeing that each spouse gets a fair trial . Although the last survey I saw rated public confidence in lawyers as somewhere in the general proximity of used-car salesmen , I think this is one area where a lawyer ( one for each spouse ) can provide truly needed protection . <p> By James Buck <p> Illustrated by Don Trawin <p> <p> James Buck is a member of the Bar Association of Indiana , as well as the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers . <p> BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO <p> " Ben tells me he misses Dad when he 's with me , and he misses me when he 's with Dad . There 's never a time when he does n't miss the love of one of us . There 's never a time when he can have the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " . . . a good marriage is a wonderful thing , one of life 's greatest joys , and I 've pursued that quest again and again . "  --  Melvin Belli , divorce lawyer <p> <p> " What starts love is looking through rose-colored glasses . You idealize your future with this other person ; you put your best foot forward . Then real living sets in . Romance takes a back seat to bills , job aggravations , family problems . You focus on those things instead of cultivating your relationship . When you plant a tree and do n't water it , it dies . So does love .
