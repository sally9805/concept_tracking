At first glance , the legislation under discussion in the Diet last week seemed innocuous enough . The bill before the house called for the creation of a " United Nations Peace Cooperation Corps " that could be sent overseas in response to resolutions by the world organization . That notion appeared unexceptionable , since Japan has long been a strong advocate of the U.N. ; yet the bill generated a furious debate . The reason : the proposed law would allow the Prime Minister to dispatch units of the armed forces to foreign soil for the first time since 1945 . <P> No issues in Japan are as controversial , or as emotional , as those affecting the military . The country 's " peace constitution " specifically renounces not only warfare but also the " use of force as a means of settling international disputes . " Opinion polls show that there is enduring support for this constitutional proscription . Thus any attempt to tamper with so broad a consensus was bound to cause trouble . <P> In response , Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's concern . Ignoring catcalls and jeers from the opposition benches , Kaifu explained that the bill was merely a device by which Japan could " cooperate with the peace-promotion activities sanctioned by a U.N . resolution . " The corps , he said , would " not use force or the threat of force , " and he denied that he was trying to circumvent the constitution . <P> The opposition was far from convinced . Takako Doi , leader of the Japan Socialist Party , the largest opposition group , called the legislation the " greatest threat to the constitution since the war . " Student organizations staged peace demonstrations . Even some members of Kaifu 's own party suggested that if the legislation failed , the Prime Minister and his Cabinet should resign and an election should be called as a referendum on the issue . Said Yozo Yokota , a law professor at International Christian University : " This is a historic turning point in Japanese politics and diplomacy . " <P> Kaifu was forced into the imbroglio by the crisis in the Persian Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government belatedly offered $4 billion in cash to support the frontline states and the multinational forces arrayed against Iraq . Yet many Japanese realized that simply handing out money was an insufficient gesture at a time when other nations were sending soldiers to risk their lives in the Saudi desert . In a newspaper interview , former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone , showing his occasional affinity for tasteless similes , declared , " If we were to try to settle everything with money , we would be viewed like the Merchant of Venice . " <P> Kaifu , himself a dove on the issue , was influenced not only by those who felt Japan should take a firmer position in support of U.S. foreign policy but also by those who believe the country 's armed forces should be strengthened for the national good . At a time when university graduates can expect multiple job offers , recruiting for the military is a serious problem . Last March , 59 cadets  --  a record number  --  in the 424-member graduating class of the National Defense Academy refused to enter the services after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
