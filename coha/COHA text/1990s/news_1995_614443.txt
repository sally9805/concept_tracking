<p> Felix Hoffman , an Atlanta retiree and film buff , complains that his cable system has " all these channels for buying stuff , " but not the channel he wants : Turner Classic Movies , which features the top shelf of Turner 's movie library - like classic MGM musicals . <p> The History Channel intrigues Tim Crimmins , chairman of Georgia State University 's history department . He knows it 's out there somewhere in other cities , but he 's never seen it . <p> An entire first-grade class at Riverdale 's E.W. Oliver Elementary School has seen videos from the Cartoon Network - 7-year-old Joseph Dursun 's mom , Carolyn , works for the Atlanta-based animation channel . But they ca n't get it on their home sets . <p> " I want my MTV " was the marketing slogan cum rallying cry of cable 's infancy in the early ' 80s . <p> Now MTV is everywhere , but there 's a chorus of voices wanting new cable offer ings that are tantalizingly beyond reach . Not only the Turner- owned Cartoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the TV Food Network , the Home &; Garden Network , Nostalgia , Bravo , the Game Show Channel , and on and on . <p> Hampered in part by changing government regulations and the high cost of the new technology needed to add channels , cable companies have been slow to respond , but now a new wave of cable channels is about to crest in homes in Atlanta and nationwide . <p> In a $ 300 million project to expand their long-static cable lineups , Georgia Cable Television and Wometco plan to add roughly 20 new cable channels , with about 10 percent of lucky Atlantans getting their first taste by December . GCTV/Wometco covers the city of Atlanta , all of Clayton and Douglas counties , and most of Fulton , DeKalb , Cobb and Fayette counties . <p> Most suburban systems also are working on adding channels soon . <p> " We have to have improved customer service , " says Steve Andrews , president of Southern Multimedia Communications , a subsidiary of U.S. West , which owns both GCTV and Wometco . ( The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought by U.S. West last year . They 'll be relaunched as one entity with a new name in September . ) <p> And if all goes according to plan , customer service should be greatly improved . New technology - fiber-optic cable and more powerful amplifiers to send out cable signals - should give cable subscribers a clearer picture and fewer cable outages . <p> But it 's the addition of about 20 new channels that puts Atlanta cable near the leading edge nationally . There are already systems with more channels , says Rich D'Amato , senior director for public affairs of the National Cable Television Association , but he adds : " You guys are at the high end . " <p> GCTV/Wometco has been polling its subscribers , and found that the most-requested channels ( not in order ) were Cartoon Network , Turner Classic Movies , CNN International , The History Channel , the Sc-Fi Channel and the Golf Channel . Although it 's not a lock they 'll be added , GCTV marketing director Anne Landers says : " We 're trying to add what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else might be coming , because they have to negotiate a fee with each network . But Andrews said Court TV did not do as well as expected in the survey . <p> What GCTV/Wometco officials still do n't know is how they will price the new channels . Basic cable service - and its price - will stay the same for those who do n't want their bill to increase , promises Andrews . The new channels will be packaged into " tiers " - groupings of several channels - and each tier will be sold separately . <p> " It 's not an easy thing to package and price these things , " says Andrews . A possible scenario - not from GCTV/Wometco but from knowledgeable cable insiders - would be four tiers of five new channels each at $ 2-$ 3 a tier , or about 50 cents per new channel . <p> " There will be a price decrease per volume of product , " Andrews says , meaning that if you sign up for everything , you 'll be paying less per channel than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> " The pricing is so complicated , " says Andrews . <p> Also complicated - and potentially just as controversial - is who will get the new channels first , perhaps in December , and last , probably around the end of 1997 . GCTV/Wometco hopes it will have about 50,000 subscribers - 10 percent of its total - for the first rollout in December . <p> " It 's a sensitive issue , " says Andrews . " Everybody wants to be first . We 'll be trying to spread out and cover lots of areas . You do n't just say ' I 'm gon na make more money in Buckhead , so I 'll spend all my money in Buckhead . ' " <p> What makes it so sensitive is that GCTV/Wometco has to deal with 56 separate franchise contracts - the deals between the cable company and every local government body in the metro area , no matter how small . These franchises come up for renewal on a rotating basis , and the municipalities pressure the cable company for more concessions - in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another complicating factor is Olympic construction and the Games themselves . GCTV/Wometco 's work will take it into 2,400 neighborhoods , where it will install " nodes " - new cable distribution boxes about the size of a refrigerator lying on its side . Each node will serve about 300 customers , and the first nodes done serve the first customers to get the new channels . <p> Andrews says the company will concentrate on trying to build the nodes in and around Olympic venue sites before the Olympics start . <p> The channel expansion is really an intermediate step toward the coming digital revolution , when cable TV will provide interactive video games , home shopping , telephone service , high-speed computer data transmission and a multitude of new channels . It 's been called " 500 channels , " although it wo n't really look like today 's lineup times 10 . <p> What it will look like is the big mystery . There are two major stumbling blocks : <p> There are not yet any cost-effective digital set-top converter boxes . This essential piece of equipment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how that will be structured , and cable operators are afraid of getting stuck with the equivalent of a Betamax system in a VHS world . <p> No one knows how much people will be willing to spend . All the amazing technological advances imaginable will mean nothing if consumers are n't willing to pay for new services . Early research has been confusing , and companies are torn between not wanting to be left behind and investing millions , sometimes hundreds of millions , of dollars for new systems that wo n't be self-supporting finanically . <p> Despite these problems , work continues to bring Atlanta into the digital future , as more cable companies replace the copper coaxial cable now being used with miles of fiber-optic cable that can carry vastly more signals and information . By 2000 , it 's likely that large parts of Atlanta will have full digital cable capability . <p> At that point , we will look back on our current cable system - with its occasional outages and 50 channels - the way we now look back on the days of black-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atop the set . And some of us will , inevitably , complain that there 's still nothing on .
