Buried within Gail Godwin 's ninth novel , The Good Husband ( Ballantine ; 468 pages ; $22.95 ) , is a wry and potentially wicked marital and academic farce . Imagine two imperious egotists  --  one , Magda Danvers , a scholar of " visionary " literature , and the other , Hugo Henry , a successful novelist  --  cooped up together at a small , liberally endowed college in the Catskills . Give them both passive spouses . Magda has Francis , 12 years her junior , whom she calls " dummy " and other affectionate epithets . Hugo has Alice , who was once his editor and is now nurse to his formidable self-regard . Surely these worms will eventually turn ? <P> One of them at long last does , but comedy has nothing to do with it . Godwin , a best-selling and deservedly admired author , plays her story straight . She not only likes Magda and Hugo , she thinks they are every bit as profound and talented as they do . <P> This authorial cheerleading causes some problems . Magda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her charismatic brilliance  --  insisted upon by the worshippers who gather at her bedside  --  remains elusive . One of her mots , about marriage , is deemed deep enough to serve as an epigraph to the novel : " Mates are not always matches , and matches are not always mates . " Food for thought , perhaps , but only to the very hungry . As for Hugo , he gives lectures , largely left to the imagination , that provoke women and men to hug him afterward . And a rather vapid remark he makes comparing a mother and a wife arouses " uproarious laughter . " <P> Maybe you had to be there . But that is what good fiction is supposed to do : convince readers that they are there . For all of Godwin 's generosity and narrative skill , The Good Husband is not a very good novel .
