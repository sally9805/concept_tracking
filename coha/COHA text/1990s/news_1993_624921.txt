<p> SAN ANTONIO  --  The tiny Carroll Bell Elementary School stands out in its south San Antonio neighborhood . <p> With its clean masonry walls and freshly painted playground equipment , it is a stark contrast to other nearby buildings . Many of those are rundown or coated in graffiti  --  the telltale sign of neighborhood gangs . <p> It 's by no accident that Carroll Bell is free of such conditions . <p> Each day , before the sun rises , Harlandale Independent School District sends a team of workers to scrub the walls of each of its 24 campuses . When children come to school , those signs of their neighborhood are erased . <p> It 's one of the extraordinary steps that districts in and around San Antonio must take to deal with the effects of poverty and violence on their schools . <p> Last week , almost 70 Bexar County schools were put on the state 's low performance list . Other urban districts  --  those in Dallas , El Paso , Harris and Tarrant counties  --  also had large numbers of individual schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But 36 percent of the 115 schools in the San Antonio Independent School District were listed as low performers compared to 22 percent in Houston 's ISD and 23 percent in Dallas . <p> Like other urban areas on the list , schools in Bexar County face difficult challenges . They must educate a large of number of so-called disadvantaged children . Many of their students are poor and enter school speaking limited English . <p> Administrators and teachers know these children must meet the same challenges in school as other children because they must compete in the same world when they graduate . Yet the task of teaching these children is not the same as teaching in more middle-class settings . <p> " " They come to school wanting to learn . They are smart children . But they do have to overcome things . We need to do whatever we have to do to get to them , " said Judy Murray , a second-grade math and science teacher at Adams Elementary School in Harlandale ISD  --  another school on the list of low performers . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't have a problem with TEA ( Texas Education Agency ) coming here to help us improve . <p> If they have suggestions on how I can be a better teacher for these kids , then I 'll do it . " Texas lawmakers this year changed the way in which Texas school districts are accredited . As part of the school finance bill , the Legislature called for school district ratings that range from " " exemplary " to " " accredited-warned . " <p> This year , for the first time , individual schools within districts were also rated from exemplary to low-performing . <p> Accreditation validates a district 's education program so a student 's diploma will be accepted by any university . If a district is at risk of losing accreditation for two years and shows no signs of improvement , it can be annexed to another . The same applies to individual campuses that are considered " " low-performing " for two years without improvement . <p> This year , schools were rated according to how fourth- , seventh- and 10th-graders performed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 20 percent of the students in a school or a district passed the test , then that school or district was put on the list . <p> Statewide , 10 school districts are on the accredited-warned list and 363 individual schools in 89 other districts are rated low-performing . <p> The majority of students in those schools  --  80 percent , according to an Austin-American Statesman computer analysis , are poor . Ninety percent are black or Hispanic ; and 23 percent speak limited English . <p> On the other end of the spectrum  --  those schools classified as high or average performing  --  only about 44 percent were disadvantaged , most were Anglo and spoke English . <p> The 13 Harlandale ISD schools listed as low-performing are no exception to the statewide statistics . The district is 100 years old , one of the oldest in the state . The late Gov . John Connally once attended its schools when the area was largely rural . <p> Superintendent Raymond Vick said that now 98 percent of the students are Hispanic . Between 16,000 and 17,000 of his 19,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roughly 80 percent of the students in his early grades speak limited English . <p> " " Many of the youngsters are first generation immigrants . <p> They come from homes where parents do n't speak English . For many , the only health care they receive is at the school , " said Vick . <p> A test like the TAAS likely does not accurately measure the successes of these students  --  particularly in early grades , he said . <p> The district , he said , also must make do on scant resources while dealing with special problems . The district 's tax rate is $ 1.74  --  about half of it to pay off bonds for buildings . <p> Like Houston ISD and other urban schools , Harlandale employs a full-time police force . It also has a team of social workers to visit homes to work with families with discipline or other problems . <p> Schools have implemented programs to help educate parents who might not have finished school themselves or need help learning English . <p> Harlandale this year set up year-round school at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elementary . <p> Principal Dixie Yarbrough said the advantages to year-round schooling and other special programs her school has put into place could n't be measured on the test this year . Regardless , she said , she was shocked when Adams was named low-performing . Last year , the school received a districtwide " " Smart Schools " award for improving the performance of its students . <p> She said she believes year-round school actually hurt the test performance of her fourth-graders . Because students go to school nine weeks and then take two- to three-week breaks , the year-round students were actually tested with about six weeks less of school time than other students . <p> " " I think that six weeks makes a difference , " she said . <p> " " We 've got to learn to do better , and we 've got to figure out how we can better teach children to take these tests . " Yarbrough 's school is located in one of the lower income areas of south San Antonio . <p> " " It 's a poor , poor area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever see , " she said . <p> The school has an education program for parents . Teachers also stay late so working parents can regularly meet with them to discuss their children 's progress in schools . <p> In addition , the school and the San Antonio Parks Department has an after-school program where the children  --  ages kindergarten through 5  --  can learn skills such as cooking , folk dancing , computers and karate or join reading and science clubs . <p> " " We do n't want to make excuses . We are not happy with our test scores . But there are a lot of different ways to teach kids , so that they are ready for the 21st century , " she said . <p> June Ramos , a second-grade language arts teacher , said she is concerned that the designation will discourage the community . " " I do n't know what they will think of this , " she said . <p> Yarbrough said many of the children that begin school at Adams in kindergarten do not speak English . As a result they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held back a year are at high risk of failing . <p> Adams now has a program that allows these students to complete two years of class work in one so that they can enter middle school with their contemporaries . Many of those students , she said , flunked the TAAS . <p> " " These kids may never be Rhodes Scholars , but we hope they will be high school graduates and good citizens , " she said . <p> At Carroll Bell Elementary School , Principal Bonnie Marlow said she was surprised by the test results . Last year third-graders were tested , and well over 20 percent passed . This year , as fourth-graders the results were closer to 6 percent . <p> " " I 'm really confused , " she said . <p> Marlow said she does n't want to make excuses , but she said the state does n't understand all that is involved with her school . <p> " " With many of our kids , we start at square one , " she said . <p> " " Other kids might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We teach some of our kids how to speak English and then how to read . <p> " " Gang influence is very apparent here and it affects the kids . " <p> Vice Principal Ken Rothrock said he and Marlow frequently must chase gang members from the school grounds . The children , Marlow said , often know gang leaders by their first name . <p> Marlow also said her school and others in the district have little money . The school did not have a library until 1985 because it could n't afford one . <p> Recently , schoolchildren and the community sold candy and held other fund-raisers so the school could buy a marquee with the school 's name for the building . <p> Rothrock said the school is working with IBM to put computers in all the classrooms . <p> Marlow and Yarbrough seem confident their schools will quickly be deleted from the low-performing list . But in the meantime , they are n't making excuses . <p> " " Our kids and our staff can do it , " Marlow said . <p> The state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop programs for their special needs . <p> " " We want our kids to be successful and they will be , " said Marlow . " " We want to receive TEA 's help . " <p> TEA spokeswoman Della Moore said there are many steps local schools and the state can take to improve performance . <p> " " We have high expectations that we 're not going to have to exercise that ( closing ) option . We feel that people will direct financial as well as human resources to improving student performance , " she said .
