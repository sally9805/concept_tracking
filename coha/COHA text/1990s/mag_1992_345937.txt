It was bad luck to be a gangster in New York City last week . As the jury forewoman chanted the verdict  --  guilty of murder , guilty of racketeering , 13 counts in all  --  godfather John Gotti could only sit with his thin-lipped smile frozen while the underworld came crashing down around him . In guarded talks , the Gambino family 's second string scrambled to regroup , shuddering with the knowledge that turncoats were singing , the feds were listening and more indictments were on the way . <P> It was a very good week , on the other hand , to be one of the U.S. Attorneys or FBI agents who for six years had tried and tried again to scratch the Teflon Don . Each time the elusive leader of the nation 's most powerful crime family persuaded the jury he was nothing more than a misunderstood plumbing salesman . But this time the government 's case looked perfect . The witnesses did not lose their memories on the stand . The tapes were clear . The underboss spilled the grim details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Velcro , " said the assistant director of the FBI 's New York office , James Fox , " and every charge stuck . " <P> Throughout the 10-week trial Gotti gave every indication that he still &lt; believed in his own invincibility . He wore the trademark suits and helmet of hair like armor , as though his natty legend would protect him once again . Overflow crowds craned for a glimpse of him ; the tabloids kept up a colorful commentary , not only on the testimony about loan-sharking , extortion and murder but also on his choice of neckwear and the fluff of his pocket handkerchief . In court he made mocking gestures , blew a kiss at lead prosecutor John Gleeson and growled loudly at U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney . At one point Judge I. Leo Glasser threatened to throw Gotti out of the courtroom . <P> It was the judge 's conduct of the trial that may give the defense its excuse for appeal . First , Glasser barred Gotti 's longtime lawyer Bruce Cutler from defending him . Then , in light of charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ordered that the jurors remain anonymous , identified only by number , and sequestered for the duration of the trial . <P> The ever indignant lawyers instantly called the trial " a glorified frame- up " and vowed to appeal . But whatever the outcome , John Gotti is now an unmade man . Many lower-rung mobsters did not like his high-profile strutting for the media ; they were especially outraged that it was his right-hand man , Salvatore " Sammy Bull " Gravano , who delivered up his old mentor , as well as underboss Frank Locascio . " The safest place for John Gotti is in jail , " observes Michael Cherkasky , head of investigations for the Manhattan district attorney . Gotti may hope to run the Gambino operation from prison , as Colombo boss Carmine Persico , serving 100 years , is trying to do with his family , but dissension is too strong among the Gambinos . <P> For one thing , their empire is under siege from all sides . The nation 's 24 Mafia families , which make at least $60 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian and Hispanic gangs that are moving in on their territory . The government has more big cases in the pipeline . In New York , where the Mob is most virulent , four of five bosses are in prison or under indictment , and two more leaders of the Colombo mob were arrested last week for murder . " Our cup runneth over , " exulted Maloney.
