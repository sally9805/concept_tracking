PENTATHLON : A NOT-SO-TRIVIAL PURSUIT <P> Quick ! can you name the five sports constituting the modern pentathlon ? That 's O.K. Even die-hard sports fans probably do n't know that shooting , fencing , swimming , horseback riding and running make up this unique event  --  which , like just about everything else in Atlanta , is a sellout . French nobleman Pierre de Coubertin , who revived the Olympics in 1896 , designed the pentathlon as a Napoleonic , soldierly evocation of the ancient game ( which included discus , javelin or spear throw , jumping , running and wrestling ) . <P> Despite its illustrious history , the modern pentathlon faces an uncertain future . Unlike new Olympic sports such as beach volleyball and the triathlon ( which will debut in four years ) , the modern pentathlon has little popular and corporate appeal , especially in the U.S. " This sport is the celebration of an ideal , " says top U.S. pentathlete Michael Gostigian , 33 . " But we have to package it better . " One small step was compressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher profile , the U.S. team named actor Dolph Lundgren ( Rocky IV ) to the administrative post of team leader . A few years ago , Lundgren made a movie called Pentathlon , and members of the U.S. team helped him train . <P> The best marketing tool would be a medal for Gostigian . In 1994 he was ranked as high as No. 3 in the world . But this past January , his friend and mentor , Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz , was killed . And the man accused of killing Schultz , John du Pont , an heir to the chemical fortune , helped start and finance Gostigian 's career . In the wake of the tragedy , Gostigian slipped in the rankings . " It 's been tough , " he says . " But in Atlanta , I just want to put together a great performance in honor of Dave .

Smothering defense helped turn a 58-32 halftime lead into a rout over a team that should be a medal contender in Atlanta . Lisa Leslie , the 6-ft. 5-in. center , led the Americans with 17 points . She said the team is paying no attention to its winning streak . " It means nothing to us , " she said . " When we go to the Olympics , it 's going to be zero-zero .
