txt British Agent the Baltic States and neighbouring territories . It was a long and often heartbreaking job to find the right types and put them to work . As in most professions , espionage involves a great deal of planning and much careful preparation . The glamour attributed to it chiefly exists in works of fiction . Contrary to popular belief , agents are not usually met in cafes , bars or night clubs but are in most cases contacted in private flats . They are not even contacted direct , but sometimes through as many as three cut-outs so that nobody knows anything about anyone else . A necessary routine precaution is to ensure that these premises have not been wired or miked by an enemy service . There are dozens of flats in modern blocks and the older mansions which are used for meeting purposes only . As an alternative to meeting an agent indoors , it is sometimes arranged to rendezvous outside and take a drive in a car . Different nations have different methods . The Russians used to specialise in leaving reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always left his messages stuck under a church pew with chewing gum . It was then easy for his comrades to enter the church on the pretext of praying and collect the envelope . But such a method is always liable to accidental discovery and was a standing joke in the British Service . One would ask a colleague by telephone where one could pick up some innocuous document and would be told in a sinister whisper to look for it under the fifth flower-pot on the left as you enter the south gate of St. James 's Park ' . Perhaps the Russian agents only deposited messages which they wanted discovered . No agent in his senses would use newspaper kiosks or bars as postboxes or accommodation addresses . It is a natural assumption that kiosk-owners , barmen and the like arc always in the pay of the police and will pass on every bit of 6o Riga as a Base information that they can get . If they do n't , then the police make it very uncomfortable for them . In my opinion , the best and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aunt or sister of an agent , or anyone living a secluded retired life and known to the agent , to receive one or two letters or packets a month in return for which she or he gets an occasional present ' .

However , to return to Riga and the problems of forming an effective network . My best agent was known as Alex ' , though Alex was not a single person and I never knew the majority of the persons of whom Alex consisted . One of Alex 's mainstays however ? I had better call him Alex No. ' - was a German . He had worked at one stage in the vast Krupp organisation but had been sacked for political reasons . I never knew the ins and outs of it , but he became a first-class British agent . I first made his acquaintance through a member of the local British community who told me that he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , he was not at all anti-German , but he was a confirmed opponent of Hitler 's expansionist plans . I subsequently met him on several occasions at the Englishman 's flat , but it was not until I felt that I really knew him that I put the question to him of working as an undercover agent for me . Alex was a man of many parts , he eventually brought in several of his business friends , mostly Latvians , who travelled to Germany on legitimate grounds and also had commercial reasons for visiting satellite countries . Alex No. 1 had a very sharp brain and under instruction he developed a remarkable flair for intelligence work . Unfortunately , the whole Alex set-up was not always blessed with great good luck and they had several narrow escapes . 61 British Agent Much of the work was routine , ensuring the passage of money and information along the channel of informers and couriers . Often bad luck , accidents or downright stupidity caused embarrassing , funny or awkward situations . On one occasion Alex sent a German courier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could not carry the large amount of money necessary for the task and it was arranged for him to call at a well-known commercial office and collect a package which would contain the cash and had been sent by some other means . Arriving at the bureau , an office boy handed him a large brown-paper parcel . With infuriating German thoroughness the agent opened it , and , in full view of an awestruck office boy , several amazed clerks and some giggling girl typists , proceeded to count the notes one by one to make sure that the total was correct . Luckily no one reported this strange occurrence except our own contact in the office , in spite of the fact that the parcel had been clearly labelled in large letters : Book Post ? Printed Paper Rate . ' Another awkward situation arose when an Alex agent was sent on a sea voyage to Finland where he was going to pay some of our agents . Overnight he left his wallet on the table by the bunk , under an open porthole . He woke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained badly stained by sea water . Money marked in this way is all too easily traceable and as a result agents would have been reluctant to take it . He had the devil of a job trying to change the soiled notes for clean ones and had to rack his brains to produce plausible reasons for what appeared to be an unnecessary fussiness . I suspect that my own efforts did not go entirely un noticed . At one particularly cheerful cocktail party I made the acquaintance of the Chief of the Latvian Political Police , a 62 Riga as a Base sinister personality who was reputed to use a human skull as an ashtray . His name was Artur Schmidkoff , a short , heavy man , cleanshaven with closely cropped hair . His massive face was wrinkled and jowelled with rolls of fat , and his dark eyes were hooded deeply . He wore a permanent scowl on his face which was no doubt to impress those around him and he had a habit of emphasising his points by banging his great hairy hands together and stubbing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings and ended in filthy nails . With a wicked gleam in his eye , he told me : " I am the most feared man in Latvia . Why do n't you come and see me some time in my lion 's den ? As an Englishman you might find it interesting .... " I could not quite make out what Schmidkoff was after and I took up his invitation ; I went along one morning to his office in a grim stone building in a side street . The basement was taken up with cells , bordering a cobbled courtyard with guards at the gate , and Schmidkoff 's office was on the first floor . The first thing I saw on entering was the human skull on his desk ? so that was true , anyway . He told me a number of stories and made the hair on the back of my neck quiver . One of the lighter tales he related concerned the British Legation . A few months before , the Legation had asked him to keep a look out for any undesirable characters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble at the wedding of Princess Marina to the Duke of Kent . " Strangely enough , " Schmidkoff confided , " I happened to have downstairs in one of the cells the chauffeur who drove the assassins of the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia in Marseilles . He had no papers and I could n't get rid of him . I promised the Legation that just to please the King of England I would keep him inside for another six months ! 63 British Agent He rocked with laughter and wrinkled up his ugly face at the joke . I never quite made up my mind why Schmidkoff invited me to his lair . He may have suspected something and hoped to trick me into some revelation . However , he certainly did not get anything out of our meeting and I never suffered anything at his hands . In fact our relationship was always of the most friendly . Schmidkoff was fond of boasting of his coups in political and criminal affairs of Eastern Europe . His most sensational claim was that he had discovered the man who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the main causes of the fall of the first British Labour Government . Zinoviev was President of the Third International and in October 1924 a letter was published by the London Daily Mail , allegedly from him , addressed to the British Com-munist Party , urging the workers to rise and overthrow by force the British Government and Armed Forces . This was only a few days before the General Election and it came as a bombshell to the Labour Party which had only recently signed an unpopular trade pact with Russia . It provided the Tories with much ammunition and they launched a vicious attack on the Socialists , the lackeys of Moscow ' . There were immediate cries of Forgery ' from the U.S.S.R. , the Labour Party and the British Communist Party , but in spite of several official investigations on all sides nothing convincing enough to prove forgery was ever revealed . The original letter was never produced and it was not even disclosed in what language it had been written . Over the years the row had simmered and boiled up when new clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denials , the matter remained unsolved . At one time it was said that it had been written by an espionage network operating in Berlin who specialised in 64 Riga as a Base forgeries of official documents , but nothing was proven at a Leipzig trial . Later again , Mr. Arthur Ponsonby , an Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office , reported a rumour that the letter had come from Riga and had been written by a White Russian . This was the allegation made by Schmidkoff . He said that with a squad of men he had raided the flat of a known ex-British agent and had discovered carbon copies of what he described as the original Zinoviev letter ' . These carbon copies had certainly been produced on the agent 's typewriter which was found in the flat . Although I tried to question Schmidkoff further , he refused to be drawn . All he would tell me was that he personally was convinced that the man was indeed the originator of the letter and he implied that it had been fabricated and passed to a British organisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter had certainly been forged and then , knowingly or unknowingly , been used for political purposes . I sent the story back to London but never received any acknowledgment . I did hear some years later the usual sort of rumour that an ex-agent connected with the affair had been paid off handsomely and was living like a lord in the South of France , but it was an uncheckable story and anyway none of my business . I was inclined to believe Schmidkoff myself ; after all , there was no real point in his making the whole story up , particu larly as his version did not reflect any particular credit on Schmidkoff 's prowess . One of the crazier citizens of Riga was a gentleman called Volodya , the owner of an old-established firm of wine merchants with whom I became friendly and whose wine set many unwise tongues a-wagging . I nearly always picked up useful tips from his parties . He was a confirmed bachelor , believing that one could live , love and laugh , but particularly love , without the ties of matrimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain in his own flat . The showpiece of his establishment was an outsize bed made especially to his order which was ten feet by fifteen with enormous polished Karelian birchwood ends . Once a year a wealthy young Pole would come to Riga to collect the rent from various properties that he owned in Latvia . He always stayed with Volodia and as , owing to the currency restrictions , he could not take the money back to Poland , he invariably blew the whole lot during his stay . These two were always searching for new sensations and the end of two weeks ' debauchery found them ghosts of their former selves . I recall one particular party which ended at a nightclub where the whole retinue of dance hostesses , previously heavily bribed , were stripped naked , anointed with butter and then , much to the amazement of house-holders awakened by the nocturnal disturbance , baptised by total immersion in a nearby public fountain . The Gulf of Riga in the summer was dotted with the yachts and launches of prosperous citizens and I spent many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outings remains imprinted on my memory . Together with several other English people I was week-ending on a magnificent launch owned by a generous and wealthy member of the Schwartzhaeupter . As the craft sailed down the River Dvina we drank copious draughts of vodka ; by the time we reached the rolling Baltic most of the passengers were rolling as well . All through the cruise a good-looking young man , Niki Balinski , sat on the cabin roof and played to us gay , wild and abandoned songs on the balaleika . He had a club-foot and wore a heavy iron attachment , but with his instrument and his melodious voice he was always the life and soul of the party . One of those sudden squalls for which the Baltic is well known struck the boat , causing it to heel violently over and Niki , in the middle of a gypsy lovesong , was thrown 66 Riga as a Base from the cabin roof into the sea , his heavy iron boot dragging him immediately beneath the white-crested waves . He never surfaced and was not seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling accident , searched for several hours , but in vain ; it was a much subdued party that returned to shore to report the incident to the police . The tragedy made a tremendous difference to Niki 's father , who was universally known as Papa Balinski . He had been a lawyer in Imperial Russia and wore a small pointed beard which he brushed daily with black boot polish to prevent people from guessing his real age . He must have been seventy . He had an unrivalled reputation with the ladies which was something of a Balinski family tradition . The wife of a senior British official once told me how she had eat next to him at dinner on one occasion and , leaning over her confidentially with his hand resting nonchalantly on her thigh , he had whispered : " Ah Madame , je suis gastronome , gastronome de l'amour . " But with Niki 's death the spark within him died too . He allowed his beard to grow its natural colour , his interest in the ladies waned ; overnight he had become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of businessmen was very pleasant . Perhaps the climate had a lot to do with it , but the English , even the Corps Diplomatique , were not nearly as fussy as they are in most other parts of the world . There was a British Club and a Scottish kirk , built on tons of soil specially imported by the shipload from Aberdeen in the eighteenth century . Every Thursday it was the custom for members to dine at the Club . The meal was laid out on the centre table with numerous vodka carafes and it was unnecessary to book a seat beforehand . Formal dinners were held on the King 's Birthday and other official celebrations . These began formally enough but often degenerated into high-spirited affairs more suited to late-night officers ' 67 British Agent mess parties . In fact , a number of service officers came to Riga ; they were sent there to learn Russian , and their temporary freedom from irksome regimental duty led them into some queer dances . Vodka , to which they were unaccustomed , encouraged them in their pranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman stood to propose the Loyal Toast and , having uttered the introductory words , fell backwards over his chair , leaving the guests standing there with raised glasses looking somewhat absurd . Not much harm was done by these roisterings and generally it was a very happy station . I had to join in the frantic social round , because not to have done so would have attracted unwelcome attention . Later , when I had set up a wireless transmitter in one of the more secluded seaside datchas on the Gulf , boating parties and boat-repairs provided an ideal excuse , and first-class cover , for my brief visits on duty ' . // Shadows of Munich J was sometimes surprised at the seemingly inconsistent way in which London evaluated reports . Often a report compiled from accurate information slowly and painfully acquired , of which we felt rather proud , would receive scant recognition ? probably , we guessed , because they had already obtained the information elsewhere . Other reports which we ourselves had rated lower might be more generously rewarded . If , indeed , London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comprehend . Occasionally one of my agents would hit a small jackpot . Later on , in 1940 , a short typewritten paragraph which gave the combined weekly output of German shipyards , fetched an immediate reward of L50 . The figure for the output for submarines , which was 2.7 per week , still sticks in my mind . Very occasionally an agent was harshly treated and this happened with the Alex set-up . We were at that time concentrating on German re-armament . As Hitler 's plan for the re-militarisation of the Reich gained momentum it became a matter of first importance to discover details of the potential of the German war machine . Of particular interest was news of any new arms factories opening up . I forwarded a report from Alex ? it must have been getting on towards 1938 ? saying that a firm in East Prussia which had hitherto been making bicycles or some British Agent such product , had recently switched over to the production of machine-guns and light automatics . We were able to give them full details . London did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very surprised when they informed us that they had sent a special agent to East Prussia to investigate and that he had reported that no such factory existed ; there was no firm of the name given in that town . The message finished by saying that this particular agent was to be dismissed at once . I was not unnaturally very annoyed and I got in touch with Alex No. i without delay . He was amazed at what I told him . " Are you sure the agent 's information is accurate ? " I asked Alex No. i . " I have complete confidence in his ability , " he replied . " Very well , " I told Alex No. z . " Send him back to East Prussia at once , tell him to go to a public telephone box and tear out the page from the directory with the firm 's name on it and bring it back here . " Alex wasted no time in carrying out these instructions and came to see me within a week . With a look of satisfaction on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page torn from a telephone directory . There , marked in blue pencil , was the entry : Waffenfabrik ( Arms Factory ) Wolff u . Ebermann G.m.bH . Here was proof indeed , not only that a firm of that name existed but that it definitely produced armaments . I sent this document off to London with a short covering note , though I resisted the temptation to remark that their travelling agent must have gone on a bit of a joyride . If I expected an apology , I was to be disappointed . After a few more weeks a letter arrived which said briefly that , since my agent had been dismissed , the matter was closed . I knew it was hopeless to try to get a decision of that sort reversed and although I wrote again , I received no answer 70 Shadows of Munich to my letter of protest . On the reverse side of the medal , one had constantly to guard against fabricated or planted information . Europe abounded with unscrupulous people with fertile imaginations always on the lookout for a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in touch with one of these types , but fortunately we caught him out at an early stage . It happened in this way . One of Alex 's talent-spotters ' had discovered that a business acquaintance in Prague had a brother serving as an N.G.O . in the German Army . What was of particular interest intelligence-wise was the fact that this man was working as a clerk in a headquarters in Saxony . The spotter had followed up this opening on his own initiative and told Alex that the N.C.O. was willing to supply military information in return for cash . I reported this to London and was told to go ahead and obtain some samples . The first sample proved to be the blueprint of a new , fast , cross-country vehicle which the German Army authorities were testing and which was at that time quite an innovation . After examining this at home the authorities were impressed and told me to send the N.C.O. a sum of money and to ask for more . The next and subsequent samples turned out to be identifications of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form : narrow strips of paper bearing the printed names and stations of units were stuck onto sheets of paper . When I asked the reason for this , the talent-spotter explained that the N.C.O. had removed copies of documents giving the locations of units from files in his headquarters . He was afraid of being caught with these in his possession and so he cut out strips bearing the unit numbers and locations which he concealed in the lining of his coat . During week-ends he then crossed into Czechoslovakia and posted the paper slips to his brother in Prague who sorted them out and gummed them onto sheets of paper . 71 British Agent London seemed quite satisfied with the information and we made an arrangement by which the sheets reached us regularly once a week . I was told to pay the talent-spotter a weekly sum for transmission to the N.C.O. In spite of London 's favourable impression I had growing doubts about these odd snippets of paper . The explanation sounded to me a bit specious and I had a hunch that some-thing was wrong . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle for the German Army based on false information was an extremely uncomfortable one . Finally , I discovered the truth . I had naturally scrutinised each sheet of paper very care-fully when it arrived and , suddenly , one week I happened to notice that the snippets were a great deal thicker than usual . All my doubts now welled up again and I decided that I must look into this more carefully . I sent for Alex No. r and pointed out the strange phenomenon . Alex scratched his head but could offer no comment . " Well , the only thing to do is to see if there 's anything on the reverse side of the snippets , " I said . We put on a kettle to boil on the gas ring , and I held the suspect sheet of paper in the steam . As a snippet fell off onto a sheet of paper held ready to receive it I quickly turned it over . The reverse side was blank . I then held the snippet itself in the jet of steam with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pulled off no less than four separate tiny layers of paper until finally I reached the top strip . There was some print on the reverse side of this . I held it up to the light and Alex and I eagerly read the two words which appeared there : Rimsky Korsakoff . On the top side of the snippet were the words : A.R.6 . Munich ( Artillery Regiment 6 ) . To say we were staggered would be putting it mildly , but then suddenly I had an idea . 72 Shadows of Munich " Stay here , " I said to Alex , and I dashed out , heading for the newspaper kiosk where I bought a copy of the German Radio Times . Back in the office we scanned each page until we found what I had suspected . Sure enough , on one page appeared a list showing where German Military bands would be playing during the week ; the print and paper were identical with those of the snippets . It was a crestfallen Alex who left my office , and I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair . Their reaction was prompt and stern . Both Alex No. z and the Prague talent-spotter were to be sacked immediately . It took some time to convince London that Alex No . I could not be held responsible and I pointed out that , with his departure , we should lose a valuable network whose reports had been completely reliable . In the end Alex No . I was reprieved and , with him , the rest of the Alex network . When I first went to Riga the British Minister to the Baltic States was Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen who later as wartime ambassador to Turkey became involved in the famous Cicero spy case . Whilst I was in Riga the Legation appeared to be the target for a similar operation . In the course of my work I received a tip that a Bait footman working in the Legation was possibly in the pay of the Germans . I passed on the information and a brief investigation was carried out , but as far as I know nothing was done about it . In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it closed in 1940 . Perhaps they had their suspicions , though . Sir Edmund Monson , who succeeded Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen , told me that he did not trust any of the household staff and kept a firm grasp of his keys at all times , and even took them to the bathroom ! The footman 's name was Toni and he was as queer as a coot . He reeked of scent and minced around in an astonish-73 British Agent ing variety of tightly-cut suits , being obsequious to the male staff and bitchy to the girls . He had a knack of moving around silently and swiftly and would turn up here , there and everywhere with a disconcerting lack of forewarning . My flat overlooked the chancery and the Legation build-ing ; one evening , when I was entertaining friends there , a girl standing at the window cried out : " My goodness , just have a look who 's going into the Legation ! " I rushed to her side and I saw , poncing up the steps with a snow-white poodle , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see who would answer the door , the betting being heavily on Toni . Sure enough , it was . After an effusive greeting the door closed behind them . It occurred to me that , as it was a Saturday , the Chancery would be empty of British staff and that someone equipped with duplicate keys would have had an easy opportunity to go through official papers at leisure . Our suspicions of the footman were later confirmed by a gentleman from German Military Intelligence ; when Toni was dismissed in 1940 he had rejoined the Gestapo . I always wonder if he managed to pass any useful information to Berlin . During the pre-war years , and particularly in 1938 and 1939 , German influence and intrigue in the Baltic States steadily increased , much to the annoyance of everyone , particularly the Russians who regarded the area as their own special sphere of influence . I lost one good contact when the Latvian Director of Military Intelligence was sacked . He was replaced , after a good deal of intrigue , on the orders of the Chief-of-Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential German girl , soon realised on which side his bread was buttered . The colony of Germans in-creased and the country was over-run by tourists and the Shadows of Munich inquisitive wandervoegel who went everywhere , complete with cameras and notebooks . As a businessman ' I was invited to receptions given by many different Legations and quite often found myself at German parties where the hospitality was lavish and the atmosphere varied from the heavy humour of the older career ' diplomats to the veiled hostility of young Party members who found it difficult to conceal their dislike of the English . I was reminded of the social gatherings when , after the War , I was going through a mass of captured enemy Intelligence files dealing with the Baltic area . Struggling through a great pile of documents full of unimportant detail , I was suddenly confronted with a photograph of myself . It was quite a shock . It was a snapshot and had evidently been taken with a buttonhole camera or some such apparatus . I was wearing a dinner jacket and for some obscure reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn in the R.A.F. The accompanying notes were lengthy and strangely inaccurate . With typical Teutonic thoroughness there was a mass of detail , but the most unimportant points were all jumbled up with the more noteworthy information . I was pleased to observe , however , that although German Intelligence had had its suspicions about me they had never found any definite proof . One passage read : Whitwell very depressed after fall of France because communications with England have been severed . This was utter rubbish and it would have been amazing if senior German officials had not realised this . I was , through an intermediary , handing in ciphered telegrams to the Riga G.P.O. daily for transmission to London right up to the day I left . If they meant road and rail travel , then the fall of France made very little difference , as we could not pass 75 British Agent through Germany after the outbreak of war and had for some time been using alternative routes . My depression , if in fact I had suffered from that complaint , was certainly not due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , clearly got results , in spite of its obvious defects : the time wasted by following false trails and dupli-cation . By a stroke of good luck , in 1938 a copy of the Black List compiled by the Nazis of all the local anti-Germans came into my possession . Some of the omissions were almost as interesting as the entries . A lot of purely social bias was evident and I noted with amusement that one old lady with a very sharp tongue , whose active days were long over , was described rather misleadingly as an agitator ' . The poor old thing was past being any danger to Germany 's warlike ambitions . Through the non-inclusion of certain names I was able to pinpoint a number of Germans and Balts who , al-though in public they appeared anti-Nazi , were in fact pro-Hitler . We were also able to warn some of our good friends to leave the country before the Russians arrived . The atmosphere of watching and waiting grew steadily worse . The crosscurrents of danger which one felt so posi-tively were not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became unwittingly the cause of getting a young Bait girl into serious trouble with the Gestapo . Her name was Elizabet and she worked as a secretary in the Legation of an Axis Power . She was a most attractive girl and because of her beauty and vivacity she was never short of an invitation to a party . One night at the end of a dinner , we both bid farewell to our hosts and then left together . At my suggestion we went along for a nightcap to a club , where we spent probably no more than an hour or two chatting and dancing before going our separate ways . I thought no more of the occasion until I received a letter from her after the war . She 76 Shadows of Munich got in touch with me through an army officer in Germany . Our nocturnal visit to the nightclub had reached the ears of the Gestapo and after she had been repatriated to Germany in 1940 she had been arrested and repeatedly grilled about her relations with the English and particularly with me . She only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant dread of re-arrest . Fortunately she bore no malice and was then quite happy , as with her knowledge of several languages she had managed to get a job with the British Occupation Forces . I had a shrewd idea as to who had pointed the finger at Elizabet . Living in Riga was a German trader named Kreutzer , known to me as the head agent of the Intelligence organisation run by the Nazi Party . I first met him at a party when he was introduced to me by a Balt ; I only clicked as to who he was when I heard his name . Later that evening he was among some acquaintances whom I invited back to my flat for final drinks . He kept away from me and would only exchange a few words , but his attractive blonde wife sat next to me and chattered quite gaily . She gave no sign that she was aware of my undercover activities , although she must have known about them . Her husband , on the other hand , seemed embarrassed by my presence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining a known and dangerous enemy agent under my own roof . Kreutzer sent voluminous reports back to Koenigsberg , a few of which I managed to intercept through an agent working for both sides . One of these was a cable telling his headquarters to arrest a certain Latvian on board a ship passing through the Kiel Canal as he was in possession of secret details about German mobilisation plans . I received this information several days before the ship was due to dock at Kiel but I was impotent to take any action as the ship had 77 British Agent no other port of call . I did signal London , and we all thought the game for our man was up and prepared for a large part of my organisation to be blown . As soon as the ship docked , our man was arrested in his cabin . He was not even allowed to dress before the Gestapo hurried him off the boat to a local headquarters . The cabin was completely wrecked in the ensuing search , his clothes and luggage ripped to bits . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pin anything on him as his undercover story stood up to all their questions . We breathed a sigh of relief when we learned of his narrow escape and for many weeks afterwards played the game with more than usual caution . With the general and obvious drift to world war the late summer of 1938 was very busy and I had to make a trip to London to receive instructions for the approaching emer-gency . I could combine this with my annual leave . I travelled through Germany by train , and one did not have to be a trained agent to see that the country was obviously preparing for hostilities . Most of the trains had anti-aircraft guns mounted on the roofs and so had some of the taller buildings . Passing through the Siegfried Line I saw the white pillboxes , conical tank traps , ditches and masses of barbed wire . In the wintry sunshine it all looked fairly harmless , with cows and horses wandering about the forti-fications , but I pondered if British troops would ever have to fight a way through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found indications that many people did not share the same hopes and were making active preparations for the future conflict . Shelters were already being dug in parks and base-ments strengthened and the whole machinery of civil de-fence was gradually building up . These were the overt signs , but behind the scenes I found my own organisation and the service ministries were all frantically planning for all possiShadows of Munich bilities . This was not easy as they were getting very little guidance from the Top Men . It was the same old story of British unpreparedness and the ostrich mentality which exists between wars . At the end of my trip I called at the office and was sitting in the waiting-room with the door ajar when I saw the Director walk past followed by the office handyman . The latter was saying : " I 'll just fetch my coat , sir , " to which the Director replied : " You wo n't need a coat . " They walked out of the front door together with the handyman still in his shirtsleeves . I wondered what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening paper . The headlines read : Cabinet shut out from No. ro and underneath was a photograph of several Cabinet Ministers waiting outside the door of No. i o whilst the police held back a crowd in Downing Street . And article explained that a Cabinet meeting had been hastily summoned to consider the latest crisis . One of the Ministers had arrived armed with his latchkey for the door of No. z o and it had got broken off in the lock . Somebody had evidently telephoned our Director to come to the rescue . A locksmith was hastily summoned who quickly removed the broken-off key , " the paragraph ended . They 'll be calling us in to crack safes soon , I thought . Once I had finished my business in London , I decided rather optimistically to get on with my holiday and I took a train to the French Riviera . My luck was out . After only four days ' freedom I had a telegram ordering me to return to London . The crisis had come to a head and Mr. Neville Chamberlain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove an abortive attempt to prevent war . It was a Monday and I was very short of money . The French banks were all shut and I had no means of raising 79 British Agent the money for my ticket . In desperation I went to the British Consul . By spinning a hard-luck story I managed to squeeze out of him a small number of francs , sufficient to get me to Paris where I could contact one of our own people who provided the fare for the remainder of the journey . When I got to London I was ordered back to Riga immediately , but , owing to the situation , it was considered unwise for me to travel via Germany and a passage was booked by plane via Stockholm . I was given a bulky package of money as , in the event of war , it would be very difficult to get funds for paying my agents . It was with considerable trepidation that I faced a landing at Hamburg after our plane had been diverted owing to bad weather . Luckily there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small isolated hut where we remained until our aircraft was ready to take off . I noticed numerous S.S. guards policing the airfields who eagerly grabbed the foreign newspapers to scan the headlines . Eventually we reached Stockholm where we were told that all our luggage must remain on board and we were directed to the transit lounge whilst the plane was refuelled . I did not like the idea of leaving this vast sum of money unguarded but the officials were adamant in refusing to allow any baggage to be off-loaded . We were supplied with snacks and coffee and I was idly gazing at the bustling airport when I saw the plane in which we had arrived start up its engines and move to the end of the runway . Horrified , I rushed to the nearest official and pointing to the aircraft asked : " Where 's that plane going ? " " It 's en route for Moscow , " the official replied . " But I 'm supposed to be a passenger on it ! " " I 'm sorry , sir . Did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and all my luggage is on board . Stop it , for heaven 's sake ! " 8o Shadows of Munich " I 'm sorry , sir . " " Well , do something , man , do n't just stand there ! " 1 shouted . " But what can I do , sir ? The plane 's gone . " I had awful visions of how I must compose a letter to London explaining the loss of several thousand pounds through having left it unattended . Happily , the official was talking out of his peaked hat . The plane had merely gone to another part of the airfield for some minor mechanical repair . Half-an-hour later I was once more on board , clutching my package , determined never to let it out of my sight again . Soon after I had returned to Riga I tuned in to the B.B.C. and heard the Prime Minister make his ' Peace in our time ' speech . Tension relaxed , but there were few of us in the Baltic States who were prepared to take any bets as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER SIX Communications To outward appearances at least , that last winter before the war was as gay and relaxed as ever . There were gala opera performances with the Diplomatic Corps in full evening dress , balls and military parades . The latter were held on the National Day , invariably with heavy snow on the ground , and we all sat in official stands muffled to the eyes with thick furs . As one watched the units marching past , one could not but help feeling sorry for the Latvians . Their forces were pitifully weak and would obviously be helpless against any of the major Powers . I overheard Sir Edmund Monson , the British Minister , remark , pointing his finger at a huge moustachioed sergeant : " I 'm sure that 's the fourth time that man 's been past . I hope he 's getting overtime . " And , indeed , the idea did n't seem very unlikely . In 1938 when it had become obvious that Europe was drifting inevitably into war and that it could not be long postponed , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would still be able to get information from the Baltic back to London . Clearly it might become impossible to use normal civilian cable systems and it would be dangerous and extremely difficult to keep a regular flow of couriers running between the two countries . A powerful radio transmitter was the obvious answer , but how to get one and how to set it up was not a simple matter . British Agent I discussed the problem at length with another important member of the Alex group , Alex No. 2 . Alex No. 1 continued to work for me until he died in 1940 . Alex No. 2 had joined me as an extra spokesman of the expanding Alex ' organization and was my communications expert ; he spent many months scouring the junkshops and warehouses round the harbour area . Eventually he telephoned very excitedly to say that he had found a ship 's transmitting and receiving set . We went to see it at the breakers ' yard . In the middle of a fantastic jumble of ship 's furniture , anchors , portholes , shackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of a butcher 's refrigerator . " My God , " I said to Alex , " where the devil are we going to hide that ? " " It is quite a size , " Alex agreed , " but nothing smaller would have the range to reach London . " We decided that we had better have it , but then the owner raised an unexpected objection . " You ca n't have all this as a going concern , " he said . " By law you have got to have a licence to run a transmitting station and I dare n't sell it to you unless you 've got one . " Here was a snag that we had not bargained for . I certainly did not want to apply for a licence in the normal way . However , we persuaded him to sell it to me bit by bit , invoicing the separate pieces as spare parts . Alex took the pieces to his flat and there he re-assembled the set . Although I had warned him of the danger of having such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust anyone else with it . Then came a memorable day when we switched the machine on . There was a gentle background hum as the valves warmed up and then we were thrilled to receive London , loud and clear . At the end of the incoming call Alex proudly put the switches over to transmit and tapped 84 Communications out on the key a short message of greeting . We switched back to Receive , and waited for London to acknowledge our signal . Nothing happened . After a pause , the operator in London tapped out : Please acknowledge my last message . After several more abortive attempts we realised that our transmitter would not transmit . Alex fiddled with the dials but still nothing happened . During the next few days he took the set to pieces again and then found to his chagrin that he had wrongly calibrated it . Instead of setting it to broadcast on a wavelength of 6o metres it had been sending out on the 600 metres band . Alex soon righted the error and , within a couple of days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of our troubles . Alex asked me to meet him again ; such a summons usually spelt trouble , and so it was this time . He revealed that a neighbour had complained of fluctuating lights during the night at a time coinciding with Alex 's broadcasting . Alex had been concentrating so hard that he had not noticed that every time he depressed and released the key of the morse tapper , the electric light bulbs throughout the block of flats flickered on and off ? the set was an extremely powerful one . The only remedy was to remove it , and this was painfully accomplished over a period of two weeks to a fairly secluded datcha which one of our agents rented on the Gulf . The house stood by itself and had no near neighbours . It was built of wood , as were most of the datchas and there was nothing unusual in the odd visit from the owner ' or maintenance men ' . I was careful not to send all my material home this way . I restricted the use of the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables via the Riga post office . In the spring of 1939 a telegram arrived from Warsaw 85 British Agent announcing the arrival of a senior colleague on tour from London , whom I had not met and whose name was un-familiar to me . I was asked to meet his train the following day and the telegram ended : Will be wearing Old Etonian tie . How typically English , I thought . I felt sorely tempted to cable back : Regret unfamiliar with O.E. colours , but I thought better of it . The Warsaw train was packed and the Old Etonian finally emerged , surrounded by a crowd of chattering peasants , duly wearing his black and light blue tie . He was a tall man and so unmistakably English that even without his distinctive haberdashery I should have had no difficulty in singling him out from the other passengers . He was apparently going round checking up on communi-cations ; my masters were leaving nothing to chance . I managed to fix him up with a flat that belonged to a friend of mine and we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave me one bad moment . We had been talking till quite late one evening at the borrowed fiat when he seized on the wireless set . Muttering something about " hoping I did n't mind " he whipped off the back , fiddled with a few wires , connected up a morse tapper and started rattling off a code message to London . I was rather shaken by such expertise and I had an awful vision of it doing irreparable damage to Anglo-Latvian relations ? and my friend 's wireless set . In May I took advantage of a quiet period to go on my annual leave ? I did not want to leave it any later as I feared I might miss it altogether . I set off for London via The Hague , as I had been asked to call on a German businessman , who , through a Jewish refugee , had intimated that as an anti-Nazi he was prepared to help Britain with any means in his 86 Communications power . He was a typically good-looking blonde German and his claim to Jewish blood rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have managed to remain on excellent terms with the German authorities . Owing to his business , the import and export of electrical appliances , he was able to travel back and forth from the Reich and also to get across to England without trouble . I called on him at his office in The Hague which seemed to be on a modest scale ; it only contained a small quantity of merchandise , including a parcel of gas masks , which looked strangely out of place . I introduced myself as an acquaintance of his Jewish refugee friend and there followed some verbal skirmishings during which we sized each other up . Eventually he stated that he was anxious to do useful work for Britain and was voluble in his dislike of the Nazis , regaling me with stories of atrocities which he claimed that he had seen committed inside Germany . He pointed out the advantages of his position and he claimed to have relatives and contacts in important official posts from whom he intimated he could get information . He talked about a recent visit to Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at the War Ministry . On calling at his home , his aunt had informed him that her husband had not been home for four nights and was in the habit of sleeping at his office . Subsequently he had learned from his uncle that owing to the international situation very few of their staff left their offices and the General was personally working late every night on transportation plans . My new acquaintance also claimed to be on friendly terms with the daughter of the German Ambassador in Paris . I promised to pass on these messages to the right quarter in London and settled down for a few days in Holland , a country through which I had often passed but in which I had never stayed . The German proved an excellent host with a taste for good food and wine 87 British Agent and he gave up a lot of his time to escort me on sightseeing tours . One afternoon we drove to Scheveningen where Dutch troops were erecting sandbag defences along the quayside . Whether this was a precaution against a possible German sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort to remark jokingly : " Well , the British Army could land in Holland without firing a ' shot . What 's the point of all this ? " Back in London I handed in my report together with the note that he had asked me to deliver . My job was to give a complete and accurate report of every word that had passed between us , not an easy thing to do , and I did not reach any strong conclusions of my own . Apart from what he had told me I knew nothing whatever about him . He turned up in London a few weeks later and I gave him a drink at my Club . He stayed several days in London and I did vaguely wonder how , as the owner of what appeared to be only a small agency , he could afford to stay at the Berkeley . Apart from this I had no feelings either way . In the end his services were not accepted and , after the war , we discovered that this decision was correct . He turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business done and with orders for future action all memorised , I set off once again to France , hoping to enjoy a short holiday . I was out of luck again . Within a few days , I was ordered back to Riga . I set off by train and stopped over night in Paris where the French were full of gloom ? they were expecting bombs to start falling any minute . From there I went on to Berlin and stayed with some German friends . The first thing that struck me was the shortage of the small luxuries of life . An army officer standing next to me in a department store on the Kurfuerstendamm was told that he could only have one pair of silk stockings . At the 88 Communications roof restaurant of the Eden Hotel I was refused a second cup of coffee in spite of my insistence , and was offered a whisky and soda instead by the manager . I did get some coffee later ? though in a most unwelcome manner . A waiter slipped on a rug and fell headlong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee pot all over a brand-new light grey suit that I was wearing . Apologies were profuse and the manager hurried up and said that it would be cleaned at the hotel 's expense . He also asked , " Is there anything else I can do for you ? " " Yes , " I replied , " I would like some coffee , but in a pot and with a cup to drink it from . " He saw the joke and laughing , ordered the drink for me . On the night before I left for Riga I was invited to a dinner party at the house of a wealthy German industrialist . He had a pleasant villa close by the Tempelhof airfield . It was a hot , sticky night . Cocktails were served in the garden and the dining-table was laid out on the patio . It was all very plushy . Liveried footmen served the food and drinks and it was interesting to hear that even with all this money , my hosts were not able to lay hands on certain types of food which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the war . Although most of the German guests expressed their dislike of a conflict , not one of them seemed apprehensive . They were completely confident of a German victory . Indeed , my neighbour at table did his best to convince me of the Reich 's invincibility . As the evening wore on , tongues became looser under the influence of hock and some excellent brandy . With some surprise I heard several crude anti-Hitler jokes . An air of caution only descended when our hostess warned that a police patrol passed the end of the garden . I left Berlin wondering if I should ever see it again and , up till now , I have not done so . 89 British Agent As the train clattered towards the frontier , I noticed some cavalrymen trotting up a country lane . They were dressed in cherry-coloured breeches , very similar to those worn by the Eleventh Hussars but which I had never seen in the German Army . I asked an attendant about them and he obligingly explained that they were Hungarian guests . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At many of the stations there were crowds of Army and Luftwaffe reservists bidding goodbye to their families . Town bands in full uniform had turned out to play martial farewells as the hausfraus and frauleins wept copiously . This was July . Now it was only a question of how long and where ? Back at my post I found that work had piled up awaiting my attention . Alex and the other agents had worked round the clock sending in material . With so much tension it was a terrible job sorting out fact from fantasy . In the last days of July , there were insistent rumours coming in from all sorts of sources that a German attack on Poland was imminent . My chief German agent said that it was all rubbish but I sent a report through to London . They asked me to check it again . I did so , and quite a number of agents still insisted that they were right . As it turned out , the flap was premature but I have since often wondered if a date in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then cancelled , but according to the Memoirs of Field Marshal Keital the earliest planned date was 26th August . // On the Brink of War D LURING the summer of i 939 we had been out after big game , a German major on the General Staff . An agent called Maximilian had reported one day that he was in touch with a local Baltic baron who was married to a Reichs-German . The wife 's brother , then a German Army captain , was just completing a course at the General Staff College which would be followed by his promotion to major and he would afterwards come to spend a fortnight 's leave with his sister and brother-in-law on their estate in the Baltic States . I had had some hope that the imminent outbreak of war would have some effect on the more intelligent and informed Germans but the most common reaction , particularly in the Armed Forces , was one of pleasurable anticipation . In Latvia , I came across very few German soldiers who were not completely assured that the war would be quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this would be of inestimable benefit to the world as a whole . I suppose that from members of the military this was not entirely surprising , but it was a little disappointing . Maximilian 's baron was a thorough-going old roue . He kept a flat in Riga and gave parties there which were notorious . He was not above engaging in shady financial deals to cover some of his lavish expenditure and only British Agent recently he had narrowly escaped serious trouble on this account . The baroness , his wife , like so many German women , was completely dominated by her husband and obeyed him implicitly . " The baron is in serious financial difficulties , " Maximilian told me , " and I think he could be persuaded to sound his brother-in-law about supplying information , or else he could get his wife to do so . He 's in such a mess that I think he would jump at any opportunity to make some ready money . " The opportunity seemed exceptional . The German major would feel less inhibited in a foreign atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to harm his own sister by reporting the approach to the German authorities . Our information was that he was on excellent terms with his sister . Clearly large sums of money would have to be offered in order to tempt the baron and , even more so , his brother-in-law . I reported the facts to London and they reacted by sending a long telegram containing a list of items of information which were urgently needed , together with the prices they were prepared to pay for them . These were high enough to tempt even a rich man and the sum offered for a German War Office cipher would have made a saint 's mouth water . At my request London had checked up on the particulars of the major with the German Army List and other sources and were satisfied that the build-up was genuine . At my end , I was perfectly satisfied with my dossier on the baron and his wife . Maximilian in the meantime had wangled an invitation to the next Saturday-night party to be held at the baron 's flat and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his host if and when he was in a suitably receptive frame of mind . The account which Maximilian gave me afterwards of this 92 On the Brink of War party was stimulating . The baron 's flat was enormous , rambling all over the place , with more than twenty reception rooms , and it had been decorated all the way through with elaborate flower arrangements for the occasion . There were gipsies with balaleikas and four distinguished Russian dancers from the opera , who had all been laid on to entertain the guests . A vast repast had been set out and there were carafes of vodka and brandy with champagne bottles cooling in vast ice buckets in every corner . The guests gradually drifted in and by midnight the party began to warm up . Maximilian decided not to delay his talk with the baron unduly and so , under some pretext or other , he took him aside and gently guided him into a quiet room where they sank into armchairs . With glasses of brandy at the ready , the two of them got down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously impressed by the chance of earning a small fortune and remarked that , anyway , he detested Hitler 's Germany . Thus encouraged , Maximilian developed his plan and it was finally agreed that the baroness would prepare the way with her brother and leave the baron himself to make a detailed offer later , if the brother responded at all favourably to the baroness 's overtures . Satisfied with the results of his talk , Maximilian left the party early . Already several of the merrymakers had collapsed on the floor in a drunken stupor and he felt that it was only wise to leave at once . The exact date on which the major would arrive was not yet known but the baron promised to notify Maximilian as soon as he knew . We heard nothing for another week and then the baron got in touch with Maximilian and told him what had happened . During the first two days of the major 's leave the baroness had got her brother into a favourable state of mind with 93 British Agent hints and suggestions . After this she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serious talking in the privacy of his study . The major had listened attentively to the baron 's proposals which he said he would like to think over . He was unable to stay as long as he had hoped , as he had been posted after leaving the Staff College to a new job and had to inspect the anti-aircraft defences on the German frontier . He promised , however , to return after he had settled down in his new appointment . After his departure we could only compose ourselves to await developments . The war was not far off and I reflected what a great asset it would be for us to have an agent with such facilities for working inside Germany . Communication would present no great difficulties ; even with the outbreak of war , Germany 's frontiers with Lithuania would almost certainly remain open and a suitable courier , possibly a relative , would be able to visit the baroness without a great deal of difficulty . It would after all be perfectly normal for a brother and sister to correspond , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to come . My impatience grew daily and I began to wonder if the major would be granted leave at all as the situation gradually worsened . Finally , in August , Maximilian brought me news that the major had secured two days ' leave to visit his sister to make family arrangements against the outbreak of war . After this we heard no more for another ten days . Then the baron had to report failure . In spite of the combined efforts of the baron and his wife , the major had turned down their proposals , though his motives in doing so were a little obscure . On the one hand he had been supremely confident that Germany would gain a quick victory and had forecast that 94 On the Brink of War the war in Europe would be over in a matter of weeks . With modern techniques and weapons , so he said , the blitzkrieg would be a bloodless affair compared with the 1914 ? 18 war . He may therefore have decided that it would be a bad risk to become entangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being compromised later . On the other hand his parting remark to his sister may supply the clue to the real reason for his refusal . " Hans seems to have become a bit of a Bolshevik , " he remarked as he kissed her goodbye . Hans was the baron . This perhaps implied that he feared that the Russians were behind the offer . In any event , all I could do was to send off a telegram to London reporting the negative result . We had done our best to exploit a promising opening , but reverses like this are part of the Intelligence game . On the day the Russo-German non-aggression pact was signed , August z 1st , 1939 , I received an immediate cable from London which , once decoded , read : Ribbentrop believed talking Hitler 9 p m tomorrow night telephone from old Austrian embassy , Moscow stop Arrange tap land line and record conversation stop Top priority Ends This was quite a problem . I summoned my experts and for some time we pored over possible plans and methods for solving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines so we had no idea where to start . There were only a few precious hours in which to make arrangements . At last Alex No. 2 got hold of a telephone engineer who had helped him on jobs before . I was immensely relieved to hear that we need waste no more time . The lines from Moscow to Berlin did not go through Latvian territory , but passed straight through Poland . It had never occurred to me that London would send the cable without first checking the route . I despatched an acidly worded cable to London but received no reply . I never learned 95 British Agent whether they did manage to break in on this vital conversa-tion . I suspect that London 's interest in the conversation did not arise from the Pact itself which was a quite straightfor-ward deal and ensured that Germany could , anyway for the time being , write off the danger of a war on two fronts , a danger which had always haunted the German High Com-mand . For Russia it meant that she could concentrate on home ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Germany . Again , she could not count on the permanency of the agreement , but the pact gave both countries a vital breathing-space which need not have ended as early as 1941 . What almost cer-tainly interested the British Government was the secret agreement which , it was a safe bet , had accompanied the main pact . This last document has now been published and reads in part : 1 . In the event of a territorial and political re-arrangement in the areas belonging to the Baltic States , the northern boundary of Lithuania shall represent the boundary of the spheres of in-fluence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. In this connection the interest of Lithuania in the Vilna area is recognised by each party ... . The phrase spheres of influence ' is a particularly happy one . In fact , the German and Russian Governments had come to an amicable understanding by which Russia would annex all the Baltic states , with the exception of a part of Lithuania which would leave an uncomfortable bulge in Germany 's new front line . The Lithuanian bulge was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vilna and that bit of Poland by way of compensation . Exactly how this exchange was to be achieved caused a flurry of telegrams from Russia to Germany and vice versa. 96 On the Brink of War Russia announced that she would hand over Vilna to Lithuania and advise Lithuania that she must cede the bulge ' to Germany . This was to be achieved by two formal treaties , one between Russia and Lithuania and the other between Lithuania and Germany . Germany , on the other hand , wanted Russia to exchange Vilna and district for the bulge and then hand over the bulge to Germany . The German Ambassador to Russia cabled back to the German Foreign Office : Molotov 's suggestion seems to me harmful , and in the eyes of the world it would make us appear as robbers of Lithuanian territory , while the Soviet Government figures as the donor . . . . I would ask you to consider whether it might not be advisable for us , by a separate secret German-Soviet protocol , to forgo the cession of the Lithuanian strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea on which , I believe , the arrangements concerning Lithuania was originally based . It was eventually suggested that , when Russia grabbed Lithuania , she would merely not occupy the bulge , enabling Germany to muscle quickly in . In the event , the Soviet Government did not give their full approval to this idea and they settled the question of the bulge for hard cash . They paid Germany a large sum in cash in consideration of her not pressing her claim on the bulge . My last big task before the war broke out started with another cable from London : Vital we have full information on German Naval units and invasion craft in Hamburg and Baltic ports particularly Kiel Canal area . Easy to ask , I thought , but a damn sight more difficult to come by . The whole of the area around Kiel and the Baltic coast was closed and , without passes , impossible to enter . British Agent I soon had my eyes on a likely starter , however , a girl called Ludmila . I wanted a woman for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a man to get into the prohibited area . Ludmila was married to a cabaret entertainer but she was separated from him and he had refused to give her a divorce . The point was that the husband was touring the German naval ports and it was because of this that Ludmila could not get in direct contact with him ; he would not reply to any of her letters . I realised that here was a golden opportunity to get the details so badly needed by London . I knew that she was not well-off and she was continually complaining to friends that if only she had the money to go to her husband she was quite sure that the affair could be arranged . I managed to arrange things so that we both went to a party at the Italian Legation . I danced with Ludmila and expressed sympathy over the troubles she was having . She was about thirty-five with a beautiful fine skin ? but a fine skin wrinkles at an early age and already her beauty was fading ; she was obviously desperate to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . We remained together for the rest of the party and she agreed to have supper with me , although she added , rather flirtatiously , that she was fed-up with men and I could expect no more .... Over the meal I eased the conversation back to her estranged husband . " What 's he got to do with it ? " she asked . " I 'd just begun to enjoy myself . " " But , " I insisted , " I might be able to help you meet your husband and speed up your divorce . " She looked at me and asked : " How ? " " Well , I badly need something you can give me . . . . " " Oh Lord , " she scolded , " I 've already said I 'm not going to bed with you . You 're wasting your time . " 98 On the Brink of War " That 's not quite what I meant . I think you are madly attractive , but what I want is some information ? and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep it strictly between ourselves . Do you mind what you do if it helps you get a divorce ? " " I 'd do anything to get rid of him , " she said simply . " All right , let 's finish supper . Then we can go to my flat and I 'll tell you what I 've got in mind . " I was fairly sure about her reliability . When she said that she would do anything for a divorce I felt she was speaking the literal truth . In any case , she was certainly my best bet and I could n't afford to be too choosey . I launched straightaway into my plan : I was prepared to finance her trip to Germany . She had worked with her husband as a singer and would have no difficulty in tracing him through her connections in show-business ; she also had a cast-iron excuse for wanting to get in touch with him . She was convinced that she could persuade him to give her a divorce if she could speak to him herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurred in the divorce proceedings . What I offered her was her only chance of a divorce , and she knew it . In return she would supply me with details of German shipping in the various ports , and she would be in an ideal position to do this without incurring suspicion . Then we got down to some work . From a copy of Jane 's Fighting Ships I showed her the silhouettes of all the major German ships of war , telling her that she must memorise their outlines as she would not be able to carry notes or pictures with her . She was an apt pupil who , after a few evenings spent in my flat , was able to identify the ships without error . By this time she believed herself to be a second Mata Hari and I was forced to warn her not to imitate that lady too closely . 99 British Agent The prospect of getting to grips with her husband excited her and as we said goodbye in the hall of the flat she stroked my cheek , adding : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you " ? with such a wealth of meaning that I made a mental note to avoid seeing her alone when she got back if I possibly could . My masters in London were urgently demanding the information so I gave to Ludmila a supply of paper impregnated with invisible ink , after instructing her in the use of this simple means of deception . The sheets had to be placed in a glass containing a small quantity of water and in a few moments the chemicals in them dissolved producing the required fluid . I asked her to write at regular intervals through an intermediary , making the correspondence chatty and gossipy to avoid arousing any suspicions in the German censors . She was to write her special news , if there was any , across the paper in the opposite direction . In this manner I collected three letters with information sufficient for me to cable London with details of the dispositions of most of the units of the Baltic fleet , together with identifications of Army units stationed in the ports . Three weeks later , very late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling from the station . She did n't tell me much but said that she was coming round . I had no choice but to receive her at my flat . Hurriedly dressing , I made some coffee and put out a tray of drinks . I had hardly finished when the bell rang . She swept in saying , " Pay the taxi-driver , I have n't any change . " Rather impatiently I did as I was bid . I went to the street door and handed the waiting cabby his fare , collecting her baggage which she had left by the door . When I got back to my flat I found her sitting in an armchair , having poured herself a large glass of brandy , trying to look nonchalant and self-composed. too On the Brink of War " Mission successful , " she said . " I have got the grounds for divorce . " " But what about the rest ? " I asked . " Do n't be so impatient . I 've done that as well . " She could n't keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rushed towards me , arms outstretched , and twined them round my neck . Planting a warm kiss on my cheek , she shouted : " You darling , it 's all due to you ! I ca n't thank you enough . " I disentangled myself as gently as possible , muttering : " Well , it was a business deal . Have a drink and let 's sit down and talk about it . " She described how she had met her husband at Kiel and he , very much to her surprise , had been delighted to see her , but only because his female singer had become pregnant by a German sailor and he had had to sack her . Ludmila , who had given up crooning on her marriage , stepped into the vacant role and naturally went wherever her husband had an engagement . They visited a number of naval ports and Ludmila was able to collect a good deal of information from observations and by cleverly questioning Naval and Army officers and N.C.O.s whom she met . We worked all night , collating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had finished , dawn was breaking . She had had a lot to drink and was beginning to feel amorous , but I managed to convince her that the most important thing for her was a rest . To my relief , she accepted a bed in the spare room and went immediately off to sleep . I returned to the living-room where I encoded the message which I sent as quickly as possible to my courier . I later received a terse letter of acknowledgment and thanks from London . On the 31st of August 1939 , the massed Panzer division of Hitler 's Wehrmacht struck across the frontiers of Poland and IOI British Agent the vast aerial armadas of Luftwaffe bombers violated its territory , dropping death and destruction on military and civilians alike . I tuned my powerful receiving set to Radio Warsaw and I heard the urgent tones of an announcement crying , " Uwaga ! Uwaga ! " ? the air-raid warning . I listened to news broadcasts while in the interval came unceasingly the defiant stirring notes of Chopin 's Etude Revolutionnaire ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gallant nation . In Riga , those of us who wished , or were forced , to remain , made ourselves as comfortable as possible . Most of the British community had already left . On the morning of Sunday , the 3rd September , 1939 , I invited a few friends to my fiat to listen to the expected announcement by the Prime Minister . We were a rather doleful bunch and conversation was spasmodic . At 11.15 a.m. we heard the smooth tones of Alvar Liddell : " This is the B.B.C. in London . Ladies and gentlemen , the Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain . " There followed a short pause and then the quiet voice of a broken man , a man who had been deceived and led into disillusion . " I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at No. 10 Downing Street . This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final Note stating that , unless we heard from them by eleven o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received , and that consequently this country is at war with Germany .... " " Poor old Chamberlain . He did his best , " said one of my guests . We all nodded and looked at each other . The Prime Minister 's voice droned on in the background as we mused over past mistakes and the nebulous future . I thought of my friends in the Army , many of whom I would probably never IO2 On the Brink of War see again . I felt then that I would rather be back with my regiment to share some of the hardships and the danger instead of being cooped up in Latvia in the guise of a phoney businessman . " We have a clear conscience . We have done all that any country could do to establish peace .... Now may God bless you all , may He defend the right . It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against ? brute force , bad faith , injustice , oppression and persecution ? and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // War Stations IFE in a wartime neutral capital is by no means dull and , in fact , proved full of surprises . The first unusual event came within five minutes of the end of Mr. Chamberlain 's speech . There was a knock at the door and a boy handed in an envelope addressed to me . The writing was unfamiliar and the letter started : No doubt you will be surprised to hear . . . It went on to say that the writer , a British agent on an independent mission , had been instructed to contact me immediately after the outbreak of war . He had certainly wasted no time . We had been in that state for only half an hour . A glance at the signature revealed my correspondent as a middle-aged Englishman whom I had met . He had arrived in Riga with his wife some months before , declaring that he was an author and engaged on writing a book about Baltic politics . He was out and about , seen everywhere , and attended all the parties , hobnobbing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinctly dubious character . His name was Daniel . He himself was a colourful character and given to dramatising situations . He had lived in the United States for some years and had acquired some of the American vernacular ; he would ' stick a cigar between his teeth and hiss out American gangster slang . Daniel never discussed his job with me , although he would British Agent talk about anything else under the sun , and in return I kept my own mouth tightly closed . Although I passed messages for him , they were in his own special code and I never knew their contents . At first I was rather worried about the company he kept . Most mornings he would wander down to the cafe near the Stock Exchange and would drink coffee with all the dubious professional agents who sat about there every morning . I knew that he was in touch with at least two agents whom I suspected of being agents provocateurs , his excuse being that he was working on background material for his book . Very few of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that he was probably a spy , adding rather mysteriously , " but for whom does he work ? " The refugees of various nationalities who had made Latvia their home were naturally alarmed as to what would happen to them . It was obvious that Latvia could not do much to protect her neutrality . Yet even this tragedy of human life had its lighter side . One morning I was sitting in my office attending to business when a vast and enormously plump gentleman was announced . He was obviously of Jewish origin . He seemed vaguely familiar and I suddenly remembered that I had met him at a party , though I was very puzzled as to why he should call on me . He came into my office , shook my hand , and could hardly wait to sit down before breathlessly telling me the reason for his visit . " Ah , Mr. Whitwell , I will immediately come to the point . I want you to adopt me as your son so that I can obtain a British passport and go to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be putting it mildly . The thought of having this great fat six-footer as a son was too funny for words . To begin with , he was three times my size and he certainly was no younger than myself , if indeed Io6 War Stations at all . I gently explained , trying not to smile , that he was over age to be adopted under British law and , unfortunately , there was nothing I could do to help him . He was very downcast and I believe he did manage to get out of the country within a few weeks ; whether Russia or Germany pounced first was of little interest to him ? his future with either country was likely to be limited . I still wonder what the reaction would have been if I had taken him to England , and perhaps to my Club , and introduced him as my adopted son . Britain 's declaration of war was not all that enthusiastically received in Latvia , mainly because of our known weakness in arms . This was well illustrated one evening at a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riga via Berlin described how she had been awakened there by an air-raid warning . She had rung for the hotel chambermaid to enquire whether she should go down to a shelter . The girl had replied that there was no need . " It is the Royal Air Force , " she explained , " and they will only drop leaflets . " " Typical ! " snorted a Latvian friend . " I can not understand why England declared war when she has n't the strength to beat Germany quickly . " " We shall win the war in the long run , " I replied mildly . " No doubt , but not until our cities have been knocked flat and we 're all dead . " I had to listen to some heavy sarcasm in the first few months of the war when most of the locals became convinced that Germany was invincible . " Oh , the English ? asleep again ! " exclaimed one attractive Jewess after our hurried evacuation from Norway . Our efforts to get information were not always successful and sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from captured documents that we had once un-107 British Agent wittingly employed a German agent provocateur for over a year who fed us with selected information provided by the German Armed Forces Intelligence Department . I have to admit that we were completely deceived by this man , largely owing to the German practice of leaking a proportion of genuine information to the enemy which was considered harmless to the German cause . Contact with this man was established by yet another Alex ' . Alex No. 3 had not been working for me very long but he was an extraordinarily able operator . I never met him as we communicated exclusively through cut-outs , but he was clearly a persuasive talker . All I did know about him was that he was a Latvian . On this occasion Alex No. 3 was watching a German vessel discharging cargo in Riga harbour . A young German came ashore and asked Alex where he could get a decent meal . Alex offered to show him the way to a nearby cafe and a lively conversation developed during the walk there . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Hans , became quite communicative and told Alex that he was the third mate in the ship which made regular trips through the Kiel Canal and thence to Holland . Like most young Germans of his generation , Hans had been in the Hitler Jugend and consequently brought up in a Party atmosphere , although his father had been a Social Democrat . Hans proved surprisingly ignorant of world opinion about Nazi Germany and of events inside his own country which were not reported in Dr. Goebbels ' newspapers . A reference by Alex to concentration camps astonished him and he refused to believe that any existed . However , he jumped at Alex 's offer to lend him a copy of the Brown Book ' published in Switzerland containing eye-witness accounts of atrocities committed in these camps . Alex handed over the book before the ship sailed and Hans promised to read it Io8 War Stations during the voyage and return it to Alex on his next visit to Riga . This he did , and during his subsequent visits Alex gradually worked on him until he anyway appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , Hans announced his engagement to a girl in Kid but confided that he saw no way of raising the necessary money to buy furniture and set up house . This was the opening for which Alex had been waiting and he hinted that he could probably help Hans to solve his problem . The rest was a question of time , and in due course Hans agreed to supply naval and other information and accepted an advance payment on account . During the following months Hans handed over items of Intelligence interest which were checked at home and pronounced to be accurate . Only once did a report clash with information received from another source . This happened some months after the outbreak of war when Daniel , London 's independent operator , told me by chance that an agent of his was travelling that week to Stettin in Hans ' ship . I asked Daniel to instruct his agent to report on his return what German warships were lying in Stettin harbour . Alex gave identical instructions to Hans . The result was interesting . Hans ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent reported the presence of two cruisers , an aircraft carrier , three destroyers and several mine-layers . I must confess that I felt little doubt at the time as to which man was lying . Dan 's agent was a highly disreputable and suspect type . Dan knew very well that he was an old German Intelligence informant but he trusted him in spite of this . " He would never deceive me , " Dan declared optimistically . " He 's a loud-mouthed type and goes down well with German servicemen . He 's able to get me some interesting pointers . " On this occasion , however , even Dan 's confidence in his 109 British Agent man was visibly shaken and he seemed in little doubt as to which agent was the culprit . His reaction was typical . " If that son-of-a-bitch is double-crossing me I 'll shoot him ! " he finally brought out . Further than that we could not get . Even later , with the use of captured documents , we could not tell at what stage Hans had reported his contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so after his meeting with Alex , or later when England seemed to have lost the war after Dunkirk ? This remained one of those questions which in Intelligence work may never be cleared up . A curious facet of life in wartime Riga was the difficulty of distinguishing pro-Germans from anti-Germans . It was usually safe to assume that a Lett would be anti-German but with the Baits , who formed the German minority , it was a great deal more difficult . I had mingled freely with Letts , Balts and White Russians in peacetime and I could not avoid doing so on social occasions after the outbreak of war , although I was naturally very much on my guard . The gay life continued until the Russian Occupation which had threatened for so long became a reality . A favoured meeting place for the evening 's entertainment was Otto Schwarz 's bar and restaurant ; the food and wine in the restaurant were first-class and a dance band played in the large bar . One Saturday evening in the first year of the war I was relaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined by a party of Baits . A pretty blonde girl sat down beside me and during the lively conversation that ensued I gathered that she held some official position in a local German organisation . Anxious to discover more I asked her to dance and after a moment 's hesitation she agreed . " I should n't have danced with you really , " she murmured on the dance floor . 1 Io War Stations " Why ever not ? " I replied , hoping to draw her out . " Well , you 're English and there 's a war on . " " But only my friends here know I 'm English , no one else will notice . " " Nonsense , you 're as conspicuous as a dog in a bright coat ( wie ein bunter Hund ) , " she said firmly . " All right then , let 's return to the doghouse , " I returned , guiding her back to our seats . Our party moved on to the Alhambra night club where I looked round the other guests and wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned later that the Russian Fifth Column came largely from a slum suburb where I had once been taken to a small but well-known restaurant . From this suburb dozens of scruffy youths on bicycles , many of them Jewish , had entered the town when the Russian invading forces moved in and had dispersed to carry out their allotted tasks . After Hitler 's might had overwhelmed Poland , several thousand Polish servicemen crossed the Latvian frontier to be interned by the authorities . Many were pilots whose services were badly needed by the Royal Air Force . With the co-operation of the Latvians , a number were smuggled out of the country and later played an important part in the Battle of Britain . A Latvian official also told me that there were some twenty-five thousand Polish soldiers who came annually to help gather the harvest and they had been stranded when war was declared . He told me , in confidence , that the Government would be only too glad to get rid of them and would turn a blind eye to any plan for evacuating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation and adding a postscript : They have no money and can not pay the fare . I never received a reply . The reason for the postscript was that I had heard , before the escape trail for Polish pilots was opened , that some dimwit at home had III British Agent suggested that the best way was for them to buy normal boat tickets . Even in wartime some of the bright backroom boys in England still tried to run things on a peacetime footing . While the Polish campaign was being fought , a British agent arrived in Riga en route for Warsaw . He needed a special permit to cross into Poland and I was lucky to obtain , through a Polish contact , a place for him on the last train . Much to my astonishment he turned up again some months later , having escaped via Roumania , just before the Germans arrived in Warsaw . He had lost all his belongings , apart from the clothes which he stood up in . In London , after much persuasion , he had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and luggage and other necessities . As he was leaving the office the chief accountant had shouted after him , " And do n't you forget , that 's public money ! " With the division of Poland between Russia and Germany , many foreign Intelligence centres moved into Riga . The Japanese , who had maintained a large anti-Russian organisation in Warsaw , were amongst them and the Japs became very active in the Baltic States . A member of the Japanese Legation occupied a flat under mine . One day my maid dropped the window-cleaning cloth into the yard below . Whether she did it deliberately or not I never discovered , but a Japanese gentleman returned the cloth and there followed a friendship which soon blossomed into an affair . I had no objection to my maid sleeping with a Japanese or anyone else , but I was a little worried in case I was being observed by means of this intrigue . After a close watch , however , I was reassured that the Jap had more interest in sex than in secrets . The flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked hard checking , discarding and rechecking the details . II2 War Stations Alex No. 2 was always a mine of information and travelled all over the country at considerable risk , often getting back tired and hungry and always handing in his report before attending to his personal needs . The incoming reports were so numerous that we were only forwarding some forty per cent of them . In those first few months of the war , we had two strokes of luck . First in obtaining the complete code used by German agents in the Baltic area for wireless transmission and then getting hold of a sample of their secret ink . The code came to us by an astonishing piece of good fortune . Alex No. 3 got a tip-off from an agent of the Abwehr that the Germans were using an illustrated weekly magazine to pass the key of their Intelligence code to their agents ; each week there was a crossword puzzle on the cover of the magazine and this set the code for the following week . It was an ideal system and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of organization . The system was too complicated for us to break so I sent a set of the magazines and papers to London . Later we received a report that the experts had succeeded in breaking the code and were keeping a close watch on it . They asked us to continue sending the magazines . In fact , I learned that it was a German agent transmitting news of Russian troop move ments which proved a valuable missing link in our informa tion from north-eastern Europe . The secret ink was discovered on the body of a dead Bait by another of Alex 's couriers when crossing the Polish frontier . It was an incredible piece of stupidity for an agent to be carrying it and we could only presume that he had been changing his lodgings or trying to make a quick getaway . I sent the container to the analytical department in London where chemists determined which reactor would develop it . An interesting item which we acquired from a down-and-113 British Agent out Czech technician was the blueprint of a device which picked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone , even when the handpiece was hung up . In other words , the telephone cable remained alive when the receiver was at rest . I believe it was based on a simple re-arrangement of the internal circuit of the instrument , plus a microphone . The only protection against it was to have a plug-in lead which could be removed during confidential conversations . A tea-cosy placed over the telephone merely amplified the voices . This particular device was manufactured by the Skoda works at Pilsen and was later operated by spies of all countries . I believe it was used in the United States by the F.B.I . when they were investigating racketeers in the unions . I never learnt if my plans were the first to get into the hands of the Allies . One bitter disappointment was our failure to let the Royal Navy know the number and types of ships taking part in the German operation against Norway . Alex had fixed up a first-class agent in the Naval dockyard of Kiel who sent a regular reliable flow of all German sea moves which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but luckily for the Germans , all outgoing mail from the Reich was stopped for three days during the assault on Norway and only after the attack had been launched did we get the full battle order . By then it was too late . A number of Polish refugees were put in touch with Alex . Most of them were keen to fight for the Allies in various ways , but very few were suitable for espionage work . They were mostly fighting men and temperamentally unsuited to intelligence work . A lot of them were smuggled out by a pro-British organisation and shipped back to England . One day Alex reported contact with a Pole , a blonde Jew , who had been employed as an interpreter with the German Army and had a very good knowledge of military plans . A ll 4 War Stations gutsy character , he had marched , during the roughest time of the year , some hundreds of miles in blinding snow , through drifts , constantly harried by patrols and border guards . The journey took three weeks and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being a Jew , he naturally went straight to the local rabbi and asked for help , which was refused . Other members of the Jewish community were also reluctant to assist , which must have sickened him , as although the penalties for harbouring illegal refugees were severe , he had felt that he could count on someone to take care of him . He was forced to roam the streets and sleep for odd hours in a railway waiting-room , but he was constantly being moved on by the staff . He fed at soup kitchens and lived in permanent fear of arrest or deportation by the police . Alex No. 2 asked me if I could find the Pole accommodation and I was in the process of doing so when Alex rang again to say that the man had solved the problem by moving in with a prostitute . He had apparently , after a final warning by the stationmaster , been accosted by a street-walker who offered him shelter and food . Strangely enough , she fed him , warmed him , washed his clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed together . She gave him a shake-down on the floor and for several days they lived in this manner . She was the Good Samaritan for whom he had been waiting , after having been rejected by others of his own race . During her business hours he walked the streets , doing the shopping , and returned when she shut up shop , usually about midnight . In the meantime I had sent a cable to London suggesting that the Pole might work for us if he could be persuaded to go back to his own country . The War Office agreed , and so did he . We equipped him with ski boots , warm underclothes , II5 British Agent and windcheaters . Into a rucksack we packed enough food for several days and I also managed to get him some Polish zlotys . He deliberately waited for bad weather and in the middle of a snowstorm set off across the frontier . A few days later I was surprised to hear once again from Alex No. 2 and I suspected that there was a crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only narrowly escaped capture . During the struggle he had lost three teeth and was badly bruised about the face and body , but he had managed to return to the street-walker 's flat . Alex had gone to see him and was faced by a very angry woman who called him a swine for getting her friend into such a mess , and threatened physical violence . Alex was worried that she might report him to the authorities , but realised that if she did , her friend would be picked up too . She gave Alex a rough time and did n't stop a flow of invective until the Pole woke from a deep sleep and told her in plain terms to shut up . He immediately added that he would be fit in a few days and would have another try . The girl threw herself on the bed , pleading with him not to do so , but he was adamant . She then turned to Alex crying : " I swear that if he does n't come back I 'll fix you for good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alex left . I received word a few days later that the Pole had departed . He was never seen or heard of again . // Between Molotov and Ribbentrop ITH the fall of France , German prestige in the Baltic countries grew enormously and their Legation started a campaign for the suppression of local French organisations which they claimed were merely cover for anti-German activities . The Reich Minister particularly pressed the Latvian Government for the closing of the French Institute , on the grounds that its cultural work was merely a facade for espionage . The Nazis pulled off a clumsy but successful bomb hoax which persuaded the Latvians that the French were guilty of political intrigue . One of the French Service attaches was at the time having an affair with a pretty secretary of a neutral legation but , unknown to him , she was also the mistress of a German official ; there was no doubt that she had been planted , for I heard from my man that she was reporting the most trivial conversations . It was through this liaison , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Institute had badly wanted to send a parcel of food and books to a Jewish friend in Germany . At this time , thousands of Baltic Germans were being repatriated by sea and undoubtedly a number of foreign Intelligence Services tried to profit by this unique opportunity for introducing their own agents into Germany . The Germans were well aware of this and kept their eyes and ears wide open . The girlfriend tipped British Agent them off about the parcel and a few days later , a Bait who worked on the staff of the Institute , said he would be prepared to take it with him when he was evacuated . This man , in the pay of the Germans , persuaded the Director to hand over a signed note to accompany the package . A few days later it was announced over the radio that one of the evacuee transports was returning to Riga after a bomb explosion . The Latvian police conducted a thorough investigation and were handed the remains of the parcel with the signed letter , curiously enough , intact . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive explosive , but the Germans maintained that here was conclusive proof of the Frenchman 's complicity in a sabotage plot . Under great pressure the Latvians reluctantly agreed to the closing of the Institute . Early in 1940 we had all realised that our days in Riga were numbered and most of us came to some sort of decision as to how we would leave when the day came . The British Minister , Mr. William Orde , had been appointed to one of the South American Republics . He decided to travel through Siberia just for the experience , but he thought he had better send his wife home by air via Stockholm . It was still midwinter and flying conditions were appalling . Twice the entire Diplomatic Corps , less only the Germans , and a whole lot of other friends assembled at the airport armed with flowers and so on , only to learn that Mrs. Orde 's flight had been cancelled . On the third occasion when we had all been waiting around shivering for an hour , the plane was cancelled yet again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we would ever see Mrs. Orde 's plane take off . The day was saved by my old friend , Uncle Sebastian . He had been observing the proceedings with some interest I18 Between Molotov and Ribbentrop from a waiting-room and when he heard what it was all about he came over to speak to me . He told me that , in spite of the weather , he was leaving for Stockholm shortly in his own private plane . He would be delighted to take Mrs. Orde with him if she wished to go . I passed on his offer and I introduced him to the Ordes . Much to the relief of the farewell party , Uncle Sebastian 's invitation was accepted . The difficulty lay in one peculiar circumstance : although Uncle Sebastian was by birth a Bait , he was a holder of a Reichs-German passport and so technically was at war with us . His gesture would certainly not endear him to the local Germans but was typical of the strange atmosphere in which we all lived . What was in a way even funnier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchukuo and his passport had to be sent to Berlin for stamping . I met Lady Orde , as she then was , much later in the war in London and I recalled the flight . She admitted that she had had some qualms at one stage when she thought the aircraft was heading for Germany . However , Uncle Sebastian had faithfully carried out his undertaking and they had arrived safely in Stockholm . A few days later , on returning to the flat , my housemaid announced that a large crate had been delivered during the morning and she wanted to know if it should be opened . I said that I would do it myself and I was agreeably surprised to find that it contained two dozen bottles of champagne which I had ordered over a year before and had never expected to be delivered . There was a note inside from the French wineshippers regretting the delay , they had sent off a consignment in 1939 which had been torpedoed . They added that they hoped this lot would arrive safely as they were sending it via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stocks of wines and foreign spirits were already running very low . zig
