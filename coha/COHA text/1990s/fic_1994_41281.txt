BLUE JEANS <p> Nearly a yard across , about equally long , staked on the wall above the cash register like a proud blue banner , hung the blue jeans . Pat was dragging herself to the diet club ( held in the Beauty Shop Consultation Room ) , dawdling en route through Sportswear , toying with socks and neon sweatshirts . As soon as she saw the jeans , she knew they belonged to her . The jeans made her put down the men 's extra-large sweatpants that she could n't afford and could n't get into , and stand , feet respectfully together , hands clasped , gazing up . She saluted in her mind . <p> The Sportswear salesperson stood with his back turned to the jeans , oblivious to their charm . Smiling , he leaned on the counter , with his arms clasped in one skinny line from elbow to pinkie , his teal jacket hanging in sharp , straight folds , his hair glossy and perfect . He could have fit his head and shoulders into one of the denim legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was Pat 's opposite : thin , cheery , blond . She found it hard to believe that they were of the same species . Why had the store managers chosen him to market these proletariat American clothes , heralded by the Levi-Strauss banner ? Wendel belonged in the Boutique , being a personal shopper or misting people with cologne . Yet here he stood , between Pat and her jeans . <p> " Excuse me , " she said . <p> He did n't look up . Unwilling to bellow her need across the floor , Pat threaded around racks and tables to his counter . " I wanted to ask about those . " She pointed up . <p> Wendel swiveled and looked , smile still on but fading . Then he twinkled at her . " Oh yes , are n't they wild ? They 're special made for us . " He leaned forward , confiding . " We want to get a little baby pair to put next to them , you know , those little Levis they make for toddlers ? Would n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined finding a metallic belt and strangling him . " But my situation is , I 'd like to buy them . " <p> " Ha ! " Wendel breathed a pretty , drawn-out laugh . " You 're a riot . " He covered his lips with a finger , appraising her up and down , and then angled his way past her to a table layered with chiffon scarves . " You know , I have been looking for someone who could carry this off . Now I 'm not trying to sell you anything , but I just wanted you to appreciate this . " He plucked a pink-rosetted number from the pile and draped it around Pat 's neck . " Looks almost like silk ... " <p> Pat whipped off the scarf and attempted to hurl it back into the pile . But , even balled up , the material was light and limp ; it unfolded and floated to the carpet . " I 'm on my way to a meeting , " she snapped . " Can we get the jeans down , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off before answering . " Okay . " His tone was flat and unamused . " We can try , but if we get caught you are going to be in big trouble . " <p> Pat hurried behind the counter and began fighting with the fastenings at the bottom of one denim leg . She wished she had long nails or long arms to help her reach up and dig out the heavy staples . <p> Wendel flapped her out of the way and fussed with the material . " On the other hand , you know what I think ? I think we better call upstairs . Display would probably get upset about this . " <p> Pat did n't feel at all open to his suggestion . She dragged up a chair and stood on it , preparing to climb onto the high counter . Once there , she planned to grab the waist of the jeans and pull . <p> " If you 'll wait just a second , I 'm sure we can get this straightened out . " Picking up the phone , Wendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Hello , Elizabeth ? Listen , is it possible for a customer to purchase the items on display ? ... Well , you know those gigantic jeans ? There 's a  --  somebody down here wants to buy them . What for ? I think she wants to wear them . " He covered the phone for a minute , addressing Pat . " You were planning on wearing these ? " <p> " I do n't even know if they 'll fit . " She teetered on the plastic seat , one knee nearly reaching the glass-top counter . Her legs were strong but short ; even a tall person would have had trouble . Her overalls strained uncomfortably , reminding her how much she needed new pants . " If they fit , of course I 'll wear them . Why else would I want them ? " <p> Wendel was back on the phone . " I see . Thanks , Elizabeth . " He hung up . " I 'm sorry , our display manager said we ca n't sell you those . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something like that , you could try our Queen Size Collection . " He waited for Pat to get off the chair , and then made a show of dusting it off . He pulled it away and set it firmly against the wall , dismissing her over his shoulder . " Queen Size is on the third floor . " <p> Pat stuck out her tongue at his back . The Queen Size Collection , indeed . Everything there was twice as expensive as in any other department , and ugly . She 'd gone there once looking for clothes to interview in , and they 'd suggested a pin-striped business muumuu . <p> Pat got to the diet club late , 10 past 2 on the big clock over the door . Tammi had finished weighing everyone . She greeted Pat with a tense facsimile of a smile and flipped open the notebook again to record payment of Pat 's dues . She tucked the four crumpled dollars into the book , which was already fluttering with checks and bills . <p> Next she balanced the scale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pat had lost 1 3/4 pounds . " Of fat ! " Tammi exclaimed , and then slapped her ledger shut and scurried up to the podium . Her black skirt bunched over her goal-weight bottom , but she discreetly tugged it down as she turned to the audience , smiling . Everyone except Pat beamed back . " Hi , everybody . I 'm glad you 're here . " <p> Pat slumped into a seat at the rear of the room . She was not glad to be there . She hated the ritual welcomes , the recital of names , and infinitesimal amounts sweated or vomited away . When Tammi read out Pat 's loss , sticking her notebook under one elbow to clap , Pat felt her teeth mash together . All weight changes were flukes ; her menstrual cycle always canceled out any downward trend . Pat refused to stand up , just raised her hand limply . <p> " Go for it , honey ! " Tammi cheered automatically while looking down , consulting her notes for the next thing to say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have chosen this inane waste of Wednesday afternoons . Crocheting or bike riding or even going to work  --  she was a teacher 's aide at Oakland 's only cooperative kindergarten  --  anything appealed to her more than this prescribed masochism . She brooded over how to tell her therapist that she wanted to quit the diet club . <p> " I want everyone 's eyes , " Tammi chirped . " I 've brought in a show and tell . " From her handbag she raised a sausage-shaped , cellophane-wrapped mass . It lay across her palms like a dead snake . " I got this from my butcher ! " She plopped the package on the table and began tearing off the cellophane with the tips of her fingers , standing several feet back . Tammi always wore pumps  --  shiny , hard , high-heeled pumps  --  and , leaning forward on her toes , she looked like an undernourished figurehead . The plastic wrapping made little squeaks as she unveiled the sticky brown blob inside . " Fat ! " she said . " Ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " <p> Obscene , Pat thought , who had n't eaten meat in years . They cut up the rich flesh of an animal to eat , and then tear off what they ca n't force down and display it to be despised . Big cattle meant more red meat for Tammi and her ilk to consume , and more leather for those pumps . <p> Pat looked down at her stomach , which rounded over the tops of her thighs , and she wondered , did she beneath her skin look so greasy and dark ? She had always thought of her abdomen and hips as white , marbled mounds inside , like the firm pieces of fat circling steaks , or the layers of creamed gelatin in complex desserts . <p> The next Wednesday , Pat was getting worse than usual cramps . It meant that she would get her period soon , after twelve or twenty-four hours of pain . To comfort herself , she would have liked to drink a glass of wine in a bubble bath , and then take a hot-water bottle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she struggled onto her bike , heading toward the diet club meeting , rebellion and resentment swelling . <p> Rain had left the piles of rotting leaves on Colby Street shiny and slippery . Pat had to skirt their coastlines and swerve around , dodging traffic . It hurt to ride : the fist in her back tightened when she leaned over , and the hard , small seat dug in where she already felt bruised . Also , she would not have lost any weight  --  in fact , she might have gained , premenstrual water retention damming her up , saturating her cells . She felt slow and heavy . <p> Another bicyclist , in flapping black rain gear , struggled along in the opposite lane , and Pat was sending sympathetic eye contact when an approaching car veered , coming at Pat head on . She braked and tugged the handlebars upwards , trying to lurch the bike over the curb . She fell sideways , hitting her ankle hard . Her leg was caught under her bike , and the front wheel spun madly . Slush was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excited voices came from across the street and a man trotted toward her . " Are you all right ? " He wore a green Boy Scout uniform , and had children following : young boys , also uniformed . <p> " No . " Pat kicked and the bike shook , but she could n't free her foot . The pain made her angry , and she slapped the wet grass and glared at the Scoutmaster . " You know , you could kill someone that way . " <p> Several boys hauled up the bicycle , and one conscientiously set down the kickstand . " Could this be my good deed for the day ? " <p> The man extended his hand . " I 'm sure sorry , Miss , I just could n't see in the fog and we were singing and  --  " <p> Pat pulled her aching ankle up on the opposite thigh . Leaning forward , she untied the shoelace and peeled down the sock . Disappointingly , the skin underneath was n't even scraped , and she could move the joint easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb , put her feet on the leaves , and pushed herself up . She muttered thanks to the boy who 'd set up her bike , swung herself on it , and rode away , rather wobbly . <p> One of the Scouts piped up behind her , " Look at that on a bike . " And another , " What a fat butt . " Pat tightened her grip and hurried , willing her feet to outpace the boys ' remarks , to get her out of hearing distance of the man shushing them , saying , " Do n't make fun of her . She ca n't help  --  " <p> But even after she could no longer sense them gaping at her , even after she 'd gotten inside the department store and taken off her wet poncho , she heard the insults , over and over . " Look at that ... " The children were even crueler than Tammi . Why should n't she ride a bicycle ? Why should n't she wear blue jeans ? <p> Dripping into the corrugated metal lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor . At the meeting she stood last in line for weigh-in , her hair sending damp rills down her back . Great , she thought , more water weight . <p> Tammi played with the balance on the scale , trying to edge it down to last week 's place . " Uh-oh , " she said , writing down the new numbers next to Pat 's name . " Were you good this week ? " <p> " I tried . I 'm getting my period . " <p> " Hmmm . " Tammi pushed her lips together , and then wiped at the edge of her lipstick with a careful finger . <p> " I got knocked off my bicycle  --  " Pat stopped . Tammi was shutting the book , turning away . " Hey ! Did you hear me ? " <p> Tammi glanced back , arched her eyebrows  --  plucked to a line  --  and waited . <p> " You were n't even listening ! " Pat 's elbow throbbed , and trickles of rainwater made her shiver . <p> " Honey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her eyes traveled to the clock . <p> Pat stamped ; her shoe squished . Someone tittered , and she thought of how she must look : fat and furious . But she felt big and powerful and real . She saw her chair in the back , vacant , but refused to take her place . <p> " You fake ! " She bore down on Tammi , menacing her without knowing exactly how she would carry out the threat . She reached out , but instead of Tammi 's neck she grabbed the only thing Tammi had  --  her ledger . " You know what you can do with this ? " Pat tore the incriminating page out of the book . " So I was n't good , huh ? " She took a few steps backwards , ripping out another page , crumpling it and flinging it to the ground . She backed toward the door . " What are you going to do about this ? " <p> Tammi came toward her , panic filling her eyes , arms outstretched . Behind her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third page and held it in her teeth for a minute , and then shoved it in her mouth . Her words came out garbled . " I cah eat id ! I cah eat iss shid ! " She chewed viciously , the sharp paper edges hurting the inside of her mouth , and then spat it out . Still facing Tammi , Pat fumbled with the door behind her , and then opened it and backed out . <p> When she was out the door with the book , Pat noticed the attached checks and money . Good , she thought  --  she 'd get back some of what she 'd had to give them . She began stuffing bills into the front pocket of her overalls . They could pay for therapy . <p> " You come back ! " Tammi was following Pat . " I  --  you are disrupting this meeting ! You 're stealing ! " <p> Pat stopped , amazed . She 'd never heard Tammi sound so lifelike . She glanced back . Tammi was scolding , shaking her raised hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces shining as they peered over Tammi 's shoulder . Pat ran . <p> She had n't run hard in some time , and clutching the big record book did n't make it any easier . But she tucked her head down and moved her feet fast , and she kept ahead of the crowd all the way down the corridor . Maybe , she thought , their high heels slowed them down , or maybe they did n't really want to catch her . People stared as she tore through Shoes . She guessed shoppers did n't often get to see a running , panting , fat woman , trailed by a diet queen and a posse of plump housewives . <p> But by the time they reached Sportswear , Pat was winded . She slowed and turned on Tammi , hurling the ledger away . <p> " Look ! " She lunged behind Tammi , and the gang backed away . Pat took hold of Tammi 's hairdo , and aimed Tammi 's head toward the wall over the cash register . " That 's what I want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lousy recipe books and three fruits a day . See ? " <p> She tugged Tammi toward the jeans . " Let go ! " Tammi shrieked , clawing at Pat 's hands . <p> The chair was by the cash register , and Pat stepped on it . " Help me , " she said . " I just need a leg up . " Wendel appeared from around a rack of jackets . <p> " Ladies  --  " he said . " Is this part of your meeting ? " <p> Tammi screamed as Pat pushed off from her shoulder and achieved the counter . Wendel came toward her , reaching up , trying to stop her , but she kicked at his hands and leaned over him , reaching for the jeans . <p> They tore off with a sound of gunshots , staples flying and yards of material falling into her arms . She embraced them . She yanked until the last leg swung free . <p> " These are mine ! " she announced to the crowd below . Wendel seemed to e in shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown back silent . <p> Pat held the jeans between her knees and undid the straps of her overalls . The bib and back collapsed like lowered sails . Dollar bills flew like leaves . Pat grabbed the material at her hips , shoved the pants down to her ankles , and then stepped out . She stood above the gathering in her sweatshirt and underwear , Buddha-stomach smooth and round , her feet planted . Breathing released , she felt like a goddess . She bent to step into the jeans . <p> They fit . They more than fit  --  they made her beautiful . The jeans let her breathe and move , they gently hugged her hips and nuzzled her knees . She bent her legs , distributed her weight evenly , kept her back straight , and felt grounded . She took a long , exulting breath , inhaling the smell of new cotton . Energy flowed up the vee of her legs , up her spine ; when she moved , she would fly . <p> Before she let her breath out , store detectives had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard , an angular girl with red hair . Pat stood firm . <p> Wendel yelled in the bearded man 's face . " I told you ! " he said . " I told you we needed more security . I was just in the dressing rooms getting some clothes when she came running in here . I did n't even see her till I go back ! " <p> The man flashed a badge up at Pat . " Ma'am , " he said . " We 're going to have to ask you to step down . We do n't want to have to come up after you ... " <p> He seemed ridiculously small , and his voice was high and puny . Pat ignored him , watching the crowd below . People riding up the escalator turned toward her even before they stepped off . Store janitors and managers jogged down the aisles . Elevator doors chimed and sprang open , and people poured out : two uniformed security guards , and dozens of shoppers , trailing bags and kids , their tired faces turning alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd below Pat , suddenly turned from the detective and looked up . He threw up his hands , walked to the side of the counter , and leaned on it . " I give up , " he said . " This is too much ... " <p> The crowd grew . The dieters clustered together , some still clutching the day 's pamphlets . Tammi was adjusting her hairdo , whining at the detective , " What are you going to do to her ? " <p> Indeed , Pat thought , what could he do ? The detective put one hand tentatively on her ankle . She kicked it off . " Try it again and I 'll stomp you . " <p> Wendel laughed . Then he was winding through the crowd , calling to Pat , " Miss , oh , yoo-hoo , look , " holding something up to her  --  a metallic gold scarf , huge , almost a shawl . " Put this on , " he said . " It 'll make the outfit . You look great . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering . She draped the scarf around her front , covering the sweatshirt , and tossed the ends behind her . It glittered in the fluorescent lights . It shone . " Thank you , " she said . <p> Wendel waved to her , still laughing , and then clapped his hands . " You look fantastic ! Just fluff up your hair a little . " The diet club members stared , first at him , and then doubtfully at one another , and then at Pat . She ran her hands through her hair , which was dry now , and felt it bouncing and springing into an aureole of curls . One of the dieters giggled , and then a few began to clap , at first cautiously , and then , as the applause was taken up by the crowd , the dieters clapped as they had never clapped for a weight loss meeting . They slapped their hands together , they stamped their feet and high-fived one another , they let cheers come out and few unladylike whistles . <p> " Go Pat ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go , Pat . Go , Pat ! GO , PAT ! " Pat began to move to the rhythm , a wild African beat of clapping like drums , and as she danced more and more people crowded in , packing the aisles all the way past Sportswear , and the escalators were bringing more and more people , cheering though they could barely see , new arrivals jamming the escalator as they tried to find room to step off . <p> " Wait ! " <p> The voice was loud and rang with authority . Startled , Pat stopped dancing and found the voice  --  a woman in a chic blue suit , the store 's badge on her chest , cutting through the crowds . " I 'm the Promotions manager . Let me through , I work here . Let me through . " She made room for herself , and the people she pushed past fell silent , but the crowd beyond was still clapping and cheering . <p> As the woman moved forward , someone began snapping photographs , blinding flashes of electric white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excited . Flash  --  she was reaching to take Pat 's hand . Flash , she was up on the counter , standing next to Pat . Flash , flash , the woman was waving to the camera and yelling in Pat 's ear , " You 're wonderful ! This is great ! I called the television stations ! They 'll be right over , can you keep the crowd here ? Do you want to make a speech ? Are you under contract to anyone ? " <p> And Pat , stunned , kept smiling , kept waving , and kept dancing , sometimes running her hands down the denim legs in a show of sensuous self-approval , until the camera crews arrived . And then she had something to say . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p>
