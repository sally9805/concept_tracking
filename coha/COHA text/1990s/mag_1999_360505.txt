This may be one of the most frustrating alcoholism memoirs ever written . We hear plenty about the author 's fabulous family and friends : Brooke Hayward and Peter Duchin , Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne . The author gushes forth details of her spiked morning coffees , the countless martinis and cases of champagne , and the out-of-control life all the drinking engendered . We even hear about her father 's A.A. meetings ( Dad is John , for those who have somehow missed all previous Cheeverabilia ) . But she slides right over what it feels like to give up drinking . Did she have the help of a rehab clinic or A.A. ? How has life changed now that she 's sober ? Still , this oddly gripping account is always good for a few more tidbits about growing up Cheever . <P>  --  By Elizabeth Gleick
