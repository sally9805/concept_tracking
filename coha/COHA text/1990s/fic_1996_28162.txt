Prologue The Games Begin SAM HARRISON swung his agile body out of the silver blue Ford Aerostar , which he had parked on Q Street in the Georgetown section of Washington . Horror stories and games are popular for a good reason , he was thinking as he locked the vehicle and set its alarm . Not the comfortable sit-around-the-campfire horror tales and games we used to cherish as kids , but the real-life horror stories that are around us everywhere these days . Now I 'm living one myself . I 'm about to become part of the horror . How easy it is . How terribly , terribly easy to move past the edge and into the darkness . He had stalked and shadowed Daniel Fitzpatrick for two long weeks . He 'd done his job in New York City , London , Boston , and finally , here in Washington , D.C. Tonight he was going to murder the United States senator . In cold blood , execution-style . No one would be able to figure out why . No one would have a clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most important rule of the game called Jack and Jill . In many ways this was a textbook celebrity-stalker pattern . He knew it to be true as he took up his post across from 211 Q Street . And yet , if anyone bothered to look more closely , it was like no other stalking pattern before . What he was going to do now was more provocative than secretly observing Senator Fitzpatrick down obscene numbers of Glenlivet cocktails at The Monocle , his favorite bar in Washington . This was the truest form of madness , Sam Harrison knew . It was pure madness . He did n't believe he was mad . He believed only in the validity of the game of chance . And then , less than thirty yards across the shiny-wet street there was Daniel Fitzpatrick himself . Right on schedule . At least , close enough . He watched the senator stiffly climb out of a gleaming , navy blue Jaguar coupe , a 1996 model . He wore a gray topcoat with a paisley silk scarf . A sleek , slender woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat was casually thrown over her arm . She was laughing at something Fitzpatrick had said . She threw her head back like a beautiful , spirited horse . A wisp of her warm breath met the cool of the night . The woman was at least twenty years the senator 's junior . She was n't his wife , Sam knew . Dannyboy Fitzpatrick rarely if ever slept with his wife . The blond woman walked with a slight limp , which made the two of them even more intriguing . Memorable , actually . Sam Harrison concentrated fiercely . Measure twice , measure five times , if necessary . He took stock of all the details one final time . He had arrived in Georgetown at eleven- fifteen . He looked as if he belonged in the chic , attractive , fashionable neighborhood around Q Street . He looked exactly right for the part he was going to play . A very big part in a very big story , one of the biggest in America 's history . Or some would say American theater . A leading-man role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses for the part . He never wore glasses . Did n't need them . His hair was light blond . His hair was n't really blond . He called himself Sam Harrison . His name was n't really Sam . Or Harrison . For that night 's special occasion , he 'd carefully selected a soft black cashmere turtleneck , charcoal gray trousers , which were pleated and cuffed , and light-brown walking boots . He was n't really such a dapper , self-absorbed dresser . His thick hair was cut short , vaguely reminiscent of the actor Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard , one of his least-favorite movies . He carried a small black duffel bag , swinging it like a baton as he now walked briskly toward 211 . A camcorder was tucked inside the bag . He planned to capture as much of this as possible on film . This was history in the making . It really was history : America at the end of its century , America at the end of an era , America at the end . At quarter to twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly of ammonia and of dust and decay . He walked up to the fourth floor , where the senator had his flat , his study , his love nest in the capital . He reached Daniel Fitzpatrick 's door , 4J , at ten minutes to twelve . He was still pretty much on time . So far , so good . Everything was going exactly as planned . The highly polished mahogany door opened right in his face . He stared at an ash-blond woman who was slender and trim and well kept . She was actually somewhat plainer looking than she had appeared from a distance . It was the same woman who had gotten out of the blue Jag with Fitzpatrick . The woman with the limp . Except for a gold barrette in her hair , a lioness from a trip to the Museum of Modern Art in New York , and a gold choker , she was gloriously naked . " Jack , " she whispered . " Jill , " he said , and smiled .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
