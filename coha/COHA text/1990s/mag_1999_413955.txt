<p> " I Lost 100 Pounds-and Got into My Little Black Dress . " Dinah Burnette blamed her medication as she grew to a size 24 . But once she took responsibility , the pounds disappeared <p> For 27 years , I was one of those people everybody hates because I could eat anything . Fast foods and chocolate chip cookies were my staples . I never thought about my weight because it never changed . At 144 pounds , I was a size 10 . <p> Then , in 1989 , on my way to pick up my daughter at day care , I was struck by an awful fear that seemed to come out of nowhere . My heart raced ; I thought I was going to have a heart attack . Terrified to go on , I drove back to work , where my co-workers tried to calm me down . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dinah dropped the excuses-and her weight went down with them . <p> The attack eventually subsided , but others followed . By the time I went to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three a day . She explained that my panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance that could be treated with medication . A Big , Fat Excuse <p> My doctor warned me that the medicine might cause weight gain , but I did n't care : I was so relieved to find a solution . Besides , I 'd never had trouble with my weight . But over the next few years , I gained almost 70 pounds . " It 's a side effect of the medicine , " I 'd tell myself , as I reached for another cookie . <p> My doctor , worried about my weight , suggested I cut back to a smaller dose . I did n't follow her advice : The extra pounds scared me far less than the prospect of another panic attack . <p> Two years later , I started nursing school and spent all my time sitting , studying-and snacking . The scale went up another 30 pounds , and still I blamed my medicine . Not until 1996-when I saw my graduation snapshots-did I realize how serious my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all I saw when I looked at the photos was 245 pounds stuffed into a size 24 dress . That 's when I realized my medicine was n't making me fat . I was . The Turnaround <p> It was time to take control of my weight . Fortunately , nursing school had taught me a lot about nutrition . To start , I drank a gallon of water , ate a Lean Cuisine for lunch , and ended the day with a salad and fruit : Very few calories for someone used to an afternoon snack of two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with chocolate milk ! <p> I also walked the longest half-mile of my life . Each hill felt like a mountain . By the time I finished , my legs , feet , and back ached . The next day I did it again . I did n't enjoy walking . It hurt . I did n't enjoy eating right either . I missed my favorite cookies . But I kept plugging away . To get through the hard times , I turned to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Although that size 10 would n't begin to fit over my hips then , I knew that someday I 'd wear it again . <p> After two or three weeks , I was walking a mile-and even bought a treadmill for when the weather in my hometown of Lewisville , NC , was nasty . In the spring , I added a daily 20-minute jog in the backyard pool . This let me boost my exercise level because it was so easy on my back and legs . <p> I also improved my diet so I was n't starving myself . I learned how breakfast kick-starts the metabolism , so I began each day with a slice of whole grain bread , a box of raisins , and a glass of skim milk flavored with a little instant breakfast mix . Throughout the day , I 'd snack on fruit , low-fat yogurt , cereal , or raw veggies . Dinner was the real challenge because I was cooking for my husband and four kids too . I could usually substitute chicken and vegetarian pasta dishes for fatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids insisted on an off-the-scale favorite like sloppy joes , I 'd fix something lighter for myself . <p> Through it all , my husband , Dwayne , was wonderful . He 'd walk with me and help measure my progress . " Another two inches " or " Another inch and a half , you 're getting there , " he 'd report as I tried to button that black dress . Wearing Her Reward <p> Within six months , I 'd lost 50 pounds and was down to a size 16 . My shoes and rings were too big and my double chin was disappearing . My hairdresser , who teaches aerobics , encouraged me to start lifting weights to tone my muscles , so I joined the YMCA . Every day I used the weight machines , treadmill , and stairclimber or attended an aerobics class . It was fun because it was all new to me , and I liked the feeling of taking control of my body . Most of all , though , I loved the way I felt outside of the gym . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much easier ! I rediscovered energy I had n't had in years . <p> Exactly one year later , I had hit my goal : 144 pounds . Today , good nutrition and exercise are central to my life . I 've even converted our backyard poolhouse into a minigym . Every day I run/walk 3 miles and do abdominal exercises . I lift weights every other day and ride my bike 5 miles , three times a week . With all that variety , I never get bored . Great nutrition is n't monotonous either , since I 've learned to make my favorite recipes healthier . <p> I 'm still on the medicine , but at just half the dose . And the black dress ? It 's just a smidgen too big . <p> As told to Shelly Reese Vitalstatistics <p> Name : Dinah Burnette <p> Age : 36 <p> Accomplishment : Lost 100 pounds <p> Successful strategies : Low-fat diet , lots of water , walking , and strength training <p> Other benefits : More energy , improved self-respect Four Great Snacks with Less than 3 Grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chocolate Mousse Nonfat Frozen Yogurt Bar Quaker Chewy Low-Fat Chocolate Chunk Granola Bar Nonfat , reduced-calorie hot chocolate made with evaporated skim milk <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dinah Burnette <p> Edited by Linda Mooney <p>
