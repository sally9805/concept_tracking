 | face ; bruiselike shadows appeared under his eyes . Macguire sucked in his cheeks and his ungainly shoulders went slack . For a moment I thought he was going to faint . Go , go quickly , I told them . When they had reluctantly obeyed , the operator had me go through the whole thing again . Who was I ? Why was I there ? Did I have any idea how this could have happened ? I knew he had to keep me on the phone as long as possible , that was his job . But it was agony . Julian and Macguire returned , Macguire slack-jawed with shock , Julian even paler . About Keith . . . Julian closed his eyes , then shook his head . I told the operator : No pulse . Keep everybody away from the body , he ordered . Teams from the fire department and the Furman County Sheriff 's Department were on their way . They should be at the school in twenty minutes . " I 'll meet them . Oh , and please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw with shock and confusion , " call Investigator Tom Schulz and ask him to come ? " Tom Schulz was a close friend . He was also a homicide investigator at the Sheriff 's Department , as Julian and I knew only too well . The operator promised he would try Schulz 's page , then disconnected . I began to tremble . I heard Macguire ask if I had a coat somewhere , could he get it for me ? I squinted up at him , unable to formulate an answer to his question . Was I okay ? Julian asked . I struggled to focus on his faraway voice , on his anguished eyes , his pallid face , and bleached , wet hair stuck up in conical spikes . Julian rubbed his hands on his rumpled white shirt and tried to straighten his plaid bow tie , which had gone askew . " Goldy , are you okay ? " he repeated . " I need to call Arch and tell him we 're all right , that we 'll he late . " The area between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it ? I can use the phone in the kitchen . " " Sure . Please . I do n't trust myself to talk to hint just now . If he hears my voice , it 'll worry him . "  | Julian darted toward the kitchen with Macguire Perkins striding uneasily after him , like a gargantuan shadow . I was shivering uncontrollably . Belatedly , I realized I should have told Macguire my jacket was in the van . Moving like an automaton toward the front hallway closet to look for a blanket , shawl , jacket , something , I could hear Julian 's voice on one of the phone extensions . I pulled a huge raccoon coat off a protruding hanger . I had an absurdly incongruous thought : Wear this thing on the streets of Denver and you 'd get spray painted by anti fur activists . As I was putting the heavy coat on , one of my coffeepots tumbled out of the dark recesses of the closet , spilling cold brown liquid and wet grounds on the stone floor . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was shaking . Get a grip . I kicked at the hanging coats to make sure no other surprises lurked in the closet corners . Then I walked down the hall , looking into each of the large , irregularly shaped rooms with their heavy gold and green brocade draperies , dark wood furniture , and lush Oriental rugs , to see if there was anybody else around . The voices of Julian , Macguire , and the headmaster warbled uncertainly out of the kitchen . Then the headmaster cried , " Keith Andrews ? Dead ? Are you sure ? Oh , no ! " I heard footsteps moving rapidly up the kitchen staircase . I stood . staring into the living room , where the recent exodus of guests had left the tables and chairs helter-skelter . " What are you doing in here ? Jeez , Goldy . " Julian leaned in toward my face . " You look even worse than you did five minutes ego . " There was a buzzing in my ears . " Did you get through to Arch ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's fine . . . . There was a problem with the security system a little while ago . " " Excuse me ? " " Somebody threw a rock through one of the upstairs win-  | dows . It hit one of the sensor wires , I guess . The system went off . Once Arch found the rock , he interrupted the automatic dial . " I tried to breathe . There was stinging behind my eyes . I had to get home . I said , " Can you find something to put on ? We need to go outside . . . to be there when they arrive . " He withdrew without a word . I went into the bathroom and stared at my face in the tiny mirror . I was not a stranger to death . The previous spring I had seen a friend die in a car accident that had been no accident . I began to wash my hands vigorously . Nor was I a stranger to violence . I tested my thumb , the one my ex-husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we were divorced . Trying to bend it , I winced . The warm water stung my hands like nee-dles . In the mirror , my skin looked gray , my lips pale as dust . A problem with the security system . I shook droplets off my hands . My right shoulder ached suddenly . In the middle of an argument , John Richard had pushed me onto the open lower shelf of the dishwasher . A butcher knife had cut deeply into the area behind that shoulder , and I had paid for my protest over his extramarital flings with twenty stitches , weeks of pain , and a permanent scar . Now death , violence , brought it all close again . I looked down at my trembling hands . They had touched the cold , stiff cord wrapped around Keith Andrews ' body . The water ran and splashed over my fingers , but it could not wash out the slimy feel of the wire . I thought of Keith Andrews ' angelic expression . Saint Andrews . I had stared into his lifeless face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pale and vulnerable . . . . What had Keith said ? I 'm learning to focus on the process rather than the outcome . Not anymore . There was a knock at the door : Julian . Was I okay ? I said yes , then splashed water on my eyes , picked up an embroidered guest towel , and rubbed the flimsy thing against my hands and cheeks until they shone red . When I came out , Macguire called down that he and his  | father would be outside in a minute . I wrapped the raccoon monstrosity around my body . Together Julian and I trudged back through the deep snow to wait in silence next to one of the outdoor carriage lanterns , a respectful ten feet away from the corpse of Keith Andrews . Tom Schulz was the first to arrive from the Furman County Sheriff 's Department . When his dark Chrysler chopped through the snowy parking lot , his headlights sent a wave of light bouncing through the cluster of pines next to the old house . There was another car directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . The Chrysler 's door creaked open and Tom Schulz heaved his large body out . Coatless , he slammed the door and crunched across the frozen yard . Finally . Two men got out of the second car ; one joined Schulz . The other man came over to Julian and me . He introduced himself as part of the investigative team . " We need to know about footprints , " he said . He looked down at my shoes . " Were you the only one to go out to the victim ? " I told him two other people had been out there . He shook his head grimly and asked which way we had gone through the snow . I showed him . He turned and pointed out a large arc around our path for the other men to take . Schulz and the man I assumed was a paramedic approached the body . They bent over it , murmured back and forth , then Schulz walked raggedly back and reached for the cellular phone . His voice crackled through the cold air , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other men stationed themselves near the corpse , sentrylike , ignoring us . Julian and I stood , mute and miserable , our arms clasping our bodies against the deep cold . Schulz walked over . He stopped and pulled me in for a mountain-man hug . Ile murmured , " You all right ? " When I  | nodded into his shoulder , he said , " You want to tell me what happened ? " I pulled back to look at him , the man who had invaded my life a year earlier and stubbornly would not leave . Golden lantern light illuminated the large , unpretentiously handsome face that was now somber and grim . His serious mouth , his narrowed eyes with their tentlike bushy brown eyebrows  --  these showed willed control in the midst of chaos . His faded jeans , white frayed-collar shirt , and sweater the color of cornflowers indicated he 'd been relaxing at something before the call came in . Now Schulz pulled himself up , his stance of command . " What happened here , Goldy ? " he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know , " I said . " I saw the sled when I was loading the van , and then I saw the coat , so I went over . . . " Schulz 's sigh sent a cloud of steam between us . Behind us , three more police and fire vehicles drove up . He reached out and pulled the fur collar snugly around my throat . " Let 's go in . That 's quite a getup . The two of you . I swear . Come on , big J. , " Schulz said to Julian as he put one arm around him . Behind us , strobe flashes went off like lightning . " Be lucky if pneumonia does n't take you both . Honestly . " Another deputy silently joined us . Schulz and the other policeman walked with Julian up the narrow path that skirted the pines and led to the big stone house . I followed , clumsily trying to step in their footsteps . The headmaster was tripping down the carpeted front stairs when we pushed through to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins ' black trench coat framed his horrified eyes behind round hornrimmed glasses . Above his high forehead , the cottony mass of white hair was wildly askew . His boot buckles clickety-clacked as he marched across the foyer toward us . When Schulz identified himself , the headmaster demanded : " Is there any way we can keep this out of the papers ? " Schulz raised both eyebrows and ignored the question . Instead , he said , " I need some information about next of kin so we  | can get back to the coroner . Can you help me out ? " The headmaster gave the names of Keith 's parents , who were apparently in Europe . The deputy wrote the names on a pad , then disappeared . Schulz started his characteristic swagger down the hallway , poking his head through each doorway . When he found a room he liked , he beckoned with a thumb to Perkins . " Headmaster , sir , " he said with a deference that fooled nobody , " would you wait in here until I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded numbly , Schulz added , " And do n't talk to anyone , please , sir . Press or otherwise . " The headmaster clomped to his assigned spot . Schulz closed the heavy door behind him , then turned and asked who else was around . Julian called to Macguire , who trundled in and was assigned to another room . Perkins ' son looked deeply stunned . In a kinder tone Schulz asked Julian to sit in the living room until he 'd finished talking to me . " And try not to disturb anything , " he added . " But get yourself a blanket to warm up . " Julian 's face had a lost look that tugged at my heart . He obeyed Schulz in silence . But as we headed down to the kitchen , I ! card him choke on exhaled breath . I said , " Let me ? " " No , not yet . I 'll take you back in just a couple of minutes . We need to talk before the investigative team is all over this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the old fashioned wooden stools . I obeyed . After looking around the kitchen , he sat on another stool and pulled out a notebook . He tapped his mouth with a mechanical pencil . " Start with when you had Inc paged and work backward . " I did . Keith 's body . Before that , the cleanup , the after-dinner allks , the dinner itself . The blackout . Schulz raised one thick eyebrow . " You 're sure it was a fuse ? " I %aid I 'd just assumed so . " Who fixed it , do you know ? " I shook my head . " Oh , and one of my coffeepots was in the front hall closet . I did n't put it there . "  | Schulz made a note . " You have a guest list ? " " The headmaster would . Thirty seniors , plus most of the parents . About eighty people altogether . " " You see anybody you know was n't invited , seemed out of place , whatever ? " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one seemed out of place , I told him , but the senioryear anxiety had been palpable . " Anything else palpable ? " he wanted to know . I stared at him . He was all business . Anything else you could touch ? He gave me just the slightest flicker of a smile . John Richard Korman always said I expected him to read my mind ; Tom Schulz actually could . I wished for the two of us to be somewhere else , doing anything but this . Reading my thoughts again , Schulz said , " We 're almost done . " Then he tilted his head back and drummed the fingers of one hand on his chin . " Okay , " he went on , " anybody who was not here who should have been ? " I did n't know that either , and said so . He looked me straight in the eye . " Tell me why somebody would kill this boy . " Blood jack-hammered in my ears . " I do n't know . He seemed innocuous enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Silence fell around us in the old kitchen . Schulz said , " Julian fit into this scenario at all ? Or the head-master 's son ? Or the headmaster ? " Miserably , I looked at the big old aluminum canisters in the kitchen , the wooden cabinets painted a buttery yellow , before replying . " I do n't know much about what was going on in the senior class , or in the school as a whole , for that matter . Julian and Macguire went back out to check for a pulse when I was on the phone with the 911 operator . I do n't know if Julian , Macguire , Keith , anybody , were friends . " " Know if they were enemies ? " " Well . " I involuntarily thought of Julian 's recitation of the class rank . I le had n't talked about airy nastiness to the  | competition . I refused to speculate . " I do n't know , " I said firmly . The deputy stalked into the kitchen . Snow clung to his boots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We got drag marks to the gatehouse , where whoever it was got the sled . They have n't finished with the photos , but it 's going to be a couple hours . You got a kid having a hard time down the hall . " Schulz nodded just perceptibly and the deputy withdrew . " Goldy , " Schulz said , " I want to talk to Julian with you there . Then I 'll deal with Macguire Perkins . Tell me if this headmaster is as much of a moron as he looks . " " More so . " " Great . " Julian was sitting in the front room . His eyes were closed , his head bent back against the sofa cushions . With his Adam 's apple pointed at the ceiling , he had a look of extraordinary vulnerability . When we entered , he coughed and rubbed his eyes . His face was still gray ; his spiky blond hair gave him an unearthly look . I lc had found a knit throw that he had pulled tightly around his compact body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I moved quietly to a chair beside the couch , then reached out to pat Julian 's arm . He turned and gave me a morose look . " Tell me what happened , " Schulz began without preamble . Wearily , Julian recounted how the dinner had ended . Everyone had been putting on their coats and talking . He had stayed afterward to see if a girl he knew , who sort of interested him , he said with lowered eyes , would like a ride home . She had airily replied that she was going home with Keith . " I said , ' ( ) h , moving up in the world , are we ? ' but she was n't listening . " Julian 's nose wrinkled . " Ever since I told her I 'd rather Iv a chef than a neurosurgeon , she 's acted like I 'm a leper. "  | Schulz asked mildly , " Keith was going to be a neurosur-geon ? " " Oh , no , " said Julian . " Did I say that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited while Julian coughed and shook his head quickly , like a dog shaking off water . " Do you want to do this later , Julian ? " asked Schulz . " Although it 'd be helpful if you could reconstruct the events for me now . " No , that 's okay . " Julian 's voice was so low , I had to lean forward to hear it . Schulz pulled out his notebook . " Let 's go back . Before the girl . We have a dinner party for eighty people and a kid ends up dead . Goldy said the party was about college or something . How 's that ? " Julian shrugged . " I think it 's supposed to help people feel okay about going to college . " " In what way ? " " Oh , you know , like everybody 's going through the same process . Have to figure out what you want , have to look around for the right place , have to get all your papers and stuff together . Pressure , pressure , pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He groaned . " SATs are Saturday . We had ' em last year , but this is the big one . These are the scores the colleges look at . The teachers always say it does n't matter , it does n't matter , which makes you know that it matters . It matters , man . " There was a savagery in his voice I had never heard before . " Was Keith Andrews nervous about all this ? First big step to becoming a neurosurgeon ? " Julian shook his head . " Nah . " He paused . " At least he did n't seem to be . We called him Saint Andrews . " " Saint Andrews ? Why ? " A hint of frown wrinkled Julian 's check . " Well . Keith did n't really want to be a doctor . I lc wanted to grow up and he Bob  | Woodward . He wanted to be such a famous investigative reporter that whenever there was a scandal , they 'd say , Better give Andrews a call . ' Like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Schulz pursed his lips . " Know anybody he was investigating ? Anybody he offended ? " Julian shrugged , avoiding Schulz 's eyes . " I heard some stuff . But it was just gossip . " " Care to share that ? It might help . " " Nah . It was just . . . stuff . " " Big J. We 're talking about a death here . " Julian sighed bleakly . " I think he was having his share of problems . Like everybody . " " His share of problems with whom ? " " I do n't know . Everybody , nobody . " Schulz made another note . " I need some specifics on that . You tell me , I wo n't tell anybody . Sometimes gossip can help a lot . You 'd be surprised . " He waited a beat , then clicked the pencil and tucked it in his pocket . " So the lights came back on , the girl said no to you . Then what ? " " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who ? " " Well , jeez , I do n't remember ? " " Keith ? " Julian reflected , then said , " I do n't remember seeing Keith around . You know , everyone was talking about the lights , and saying , see you Monday , and stuff like that . Then I came out to check if Goldy needed help . " " Time , Miss G. ? " 1 looked at my watch : eleven o'clock . Schulz cocked his thumb over his shoulder . When had Julian come out to the kitchen ? I said , " I do n't know . Nine-thirtyish. " " 1 ) id anyone go into the kitchen looking for Keith ? This girl you mentioned , for example ? "  | We both said no . " Okay , now , Julian , " Schulz said impassively , " tell me who Keith 's enemies were . " " God , I told you , I do n't know ! You know , he was kind of holier-than-thou . Smarter-than-thou too . You know . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the film 's over for like two seconds and Keith 's talking about the internal structure . I mean , huh ? The rest of us are going , okay , but what was it about ? " He grimaced . " That kind of smart attitude can lose you some friends . " " Who , specifically ? " " I do n't know , you know , people just get pissed off . They talk . " " What about the National Merit Scholarship ? " I said before I remembered I was n't supposed to talk . " What about it ? " Julian turned a puzzled face to me . " It 's not like they 're going to give it to somebody else now . . . . Keith was number one in our class , president of the French Club . He did after-school work for the Mountain Journal . People can hate you just for that . " Schulz said , " Why ? " " Because it makes them feel bad that they 're not doing it too . " Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool would reach the same conclusion . Schulz sighed , then rose . " Okay , go home , the two of you . I 'll be talking to the rest of the guests over the weekend , then I might get back to you depending on ? " " Schulz ! " boomed an excited voice from down the hall . " Hey ! " It was the deputy . We found him looking at the coffeepot that had fallen out of ' the front hall closet . " Oh , that 's my ? " I began . I stopped . " Your what ? " demanded the deputy . " Coffeepot , " I answered inanely.  | The deputy regarded me with deepening skepticism . " Y'had a couple of extension cords on it ? " " Yes , three , actually . You see , they have a problem with fuses ? " But the deputy was holding up the machine 's naked plug . Belatedly , I realized where the extension cords had ended up .  | We both said no . " Okay , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me who Keith 's enemies were . " " God , I told you , I do n't know ! You know , he was kind of holier-than-thou . Smarter-than-thou too . You know .

You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the deputy was holding up the machine 's naked plug . Belatedly , I realized where the extension cords had ended up .  | Julian led the way out of the parking lot in his four-wheel-drive , a white Range Rover inherited from wealthy former employers . I could see him checking his rearview mirror for me . My van crawled and skidded down the prep school 's precarious driveway . Overhead , cloud edges glinted like knives . The moon slipped out and silvered the snowy mountains . As I thought about the events of the past few hours , my stomach knotted . At some point in the evening the tortuous road between Elk Park and Aspen Meadow had been plowed . Still , we skirted the banked curves with great care . My mind wandered back to that upturned sled in the snow . To the look of horror on Keith Andrews ' young face . I shook my head and focused on the driving . Gripping the  | steering wheel hard , I accelerated up a slight incline . I hoped Arch was okay . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloween was coming up , and pranksters had to be expected . I should have told Schulz about the rock , though . I 'd forgotten . Schulz was going to call us . He would tell us what had happened to Keith , would n't he ? I had plodded through the headmaster 's snowy yard , found the lifeless form , touched the icy extension cord . It was like a personal affront . I had to know what had happened . Like it or not , I was involved . Resolutely , I veered off this thought pattern and reflected on Schulz . Somehow , his behavior this evening indicated a sea change in our relationship , from a growing intimacy back to the distance of business . I turned the steering wheel slowly while negotiating a switchback . For one breathtaking moment on this curve , all that was visible out the window was air . Tom Schulz . We had been dating off and on , mostly off , for the past year . Recently , however , we had been more frequently and more seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French word for getting back together that Arch now dropped into conversation the way he sprinkled sugar on his Rice Krispies . Schulz and I had not really become a couple . But he and I , along with Julian and Arch , had become a unit : the four of us hiked , we fished , we cooked out , we took turns choosing movies . Schulz 's light caseload lately had consisted mostly of investigating trail thefts and forgeries , giving him time to spend with us . Insulated by the presence of the two boys , my post-divorce ambivalence toward relationships had begun to melt . I had found myself thinking of reasons to call Tom Schulz , inventing occasions to get together , looking forward to talking and laughing about all the daily details of life . And then there had been the issue of the name change . What had started out as a small problem had developed into a symbolic issue between Schulz and me . Over the summer I 'd learned of the existencc of a catering outfit in Denver with the unfortunate name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit over trademark infringement . In one of our jovial moments , Tom had suddenly asked if I would like to change my last name to Schulz . With all that that implied , I had immediately demurred . But you know what they say about parties : It was awfully nice to be asked . Only now we had a catastrophe out at Elk Park Prep . Involving me , involving Julian , involving homicide . Something told me the future of my relationship with Tom Schulz was once again a question mark . The brake lights of the Range Rover sparked like rectangular rubies as Julian and I continued the steep descent into town . We rounded the flat black surface of Aspen Meadow Lake , where one patch of shining ripples reflected elusive moonlight . Part of me wanted Schulz to say , Come back to my place . But another , saner , inner voice said this desire came from knowing it was impossible . A homicide investigation was when Schulz was the busiest . Mortality and the need for relationship loomed large since I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My tires crunched down Aspen Meadow 's Main Street . The only cars were those parked at wide angles along the curb by the Grizzly Saloon , where music and flashing lights announced it was still Saturday night . Witnessing partygoing after what I 'd just seen at Elk Park Prep brought light-headedness . I rolled down the window ; my eyes watered from the gush of freezing air . Moments later , Julian and I pulled up across the street from my house . White shutters gleamed against the brown shingles . The front porch with its single-story white pillars and porch swing seemed to smile . The old place had become very dear to me in the five years since my divorce from Dr. John Richard Korman . Arriving home at night , I was always happy that the Jerk , as his other ex-wife and I called him , was gone for good , and that my brand-new security system could make sure he stayed that way . I hopped out of the van and landed in three inches of new snow . It was less than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet above Aspen Meadow 's eight thousand  | above sea level . A sudden slash of wind made me draw my coat close . A curse rose in my throat . I had unwittingly gone off wearing the stupid raccoon thing . I put my hand in the pocket and felt tissues and something flat and hard . The thought of a trip back to the school to return the coat brought a shudder . I pressed the security buttons and came in out of the cold with Julian close behind . Arch , who of course had not gone to bed after Julian 's call , clomped down the stairs in untied hightop sneakers . He was wearing a gray sweatsuit and carrying a large flashlight  --  defense against power outages . His knotted , woodcolored hair stuck out at various angles . I was so happy to see him , I clasped him in a hug that was mostly raccoon coat . He pulled hack and straightened the glasses on his small , freckled nose . Magnified brown eyes regarded Julian and me with intense interest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weird thing ? What 's going on ? All you said was that there was a problem at the headmaster 's house . Does that mean we do n't have school on Monday ? " This prospect seemed to please him . " No , no , " I said . Weariness washed over me . We were home , finally , and all I wanted was for everyone to go to bed . I said , " Someone was hurt after the dinner . " " Who ? " Arch pulled his thin shoulders up to his ears and made a face . " Was there an accident ? " " Not quite . Keith Andrews , a senior , died . " I did not say that it looked as if he 'd been murdered . This was a mistake . " Keith Andrews ? The president of the French Club ? " Arch looked at Julian , full of fear . " The guy you had that fight with ? Man ! You 're kidding ! " Julian closed his eyes and shrugged . A fight had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows at Julian ; his facial expression stayed flat . I said , " I 'm sorry , Arch . Tom Schulz and the police are over at the school now ? " " ' Foul Schulz ! " cried Arch . " So they  | " Arch , buddy , " said Julian . " Chill . Nobody knows what happened . Really . " Arch 's eyes traveled from Julian back to me . He said , " A lot of people at school did n't like Keith . I liked him , though . He did n't drive around in a Porsche or BMW , like he was so cool . You know , the way some of the older kids do . He was nice . " Arch 's words hung in the air of my front hall . How easily he had put the boy 's life in past tense . Finally I said , " Well , hon , I 'd rather not talk about it now , if that 's okay . So . you had a problem with a broken window ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the rock out . So much for fingerprints . But the rock was tennis-ball-size and jagged . It probably would n't have held a print anybet it was some kids from my old school . Trick or treat . " Arch sighed . When did this happen ? " " Oh , late . Right before Julian called . " took the rock from him . Did I have any clients who were angry ; None that I could think of . In any event , I was too tired to think about it . " Church tomorrow , " I said to Arch as I pocketed the stone and started toward the kitchen . But it 's been snowing ! " " Arch , I ca n't take any more in one night . " " Hey , guy , " said Julian , " if you come up with me now , I 'll let you show me that model you made from the Narnia book . " " you mean the wardrobe with the fake back ? " " Whatever . " And before I could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . Arch let out a howl trying to heat Julian to the room they now shared . I looked around the hall and thought hut the boxes of dishes waiting in my van to he washed . It was past midnight . They would keep . I shrugged off the coat and looked at the thing in the pocket. ,  | It was a Neiman-Marcus credit card . The name on it was K. Andrews . I swept up the glass shards underneath Arch 's broken window , taped a piece of cardboard over the hole , slumped into my room , and fell into bed . Fitful sleep came interspersed with nightmares . I awoke with a dull headache and the realization that the previous evening had not been a bad dream . There was no way Schulz could have left Elk Park Prep before midnight . Rather than wake him at home , I put in a call about the credit card to his voice mail at the Sheriff 's Department . Neiman-Marcus for an eighteen-year-old ? But Arch had said Keith did not show off , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so cool . On my braided rug , Scout the cat turned his chin in the air and dramatically flopped over on his back . I obediently scratched the long white fur of his stomach , light brown hair of his back , dark brown hair of his face . While Julian had inherited his Range Rover from the rich folks the two of us had worked for , my inheritance had been the feline . I felt content with my part of the unexpected beneficence . Scout was always full of affection when it was eating time . Perfect cat for a caterer . Speaking of which , I had work to do . For me , cats were safer than credit cards . I had never even been inside Denver 's new Neiman-Marcus store , I reflected as I began to stretch through twenty minutes of yoga . In general , Dr. John Richard Korman 's child-support payments were late , incorrect , or nonexistent . My calendar shrieked with assignments for this busiest season for caterers , the stretch between Halloween and Christmas . During November and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was my most profitable time of year . No matter what was going on out at Elk Park Prep , I had to earn enough money for our household to scrape through the first six months of the new year .  | Upscale department stores were definitely no longer a part of my lifestyle . In the kitchen , Scout twined through my legs and I fed him before consulting the calendar . Unfortunately , my first job of the day was not even income-producing , although it was a tax writeoff . In a moment of weakness I had agreed to prepare the refreshments to follow that morning 's ten o'clock service at the Episcopal church . This would be followed by a more profitable half-time meal of choucroute garnie for twelve Bronco fans at the Dawsons ' house . Trick of caterers : Always use the French name for food . People will not pay large sums for a menu of sausage and sauer-kraut . No rest for the weary , especially the catering weary , I thought as I hauled in yesterday 's crates of pans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was done , I washed my hands and began to plan . I had to call Audrey Coopersmith and remind her that for the half-time meal she needed to wear a Bronco-orange T-shirt . Despite the fact that she had worked late with me the night before , I knew Audrey would be up early this Sunday morning . With the depression brought on by her divorce trauma , Audrey rarely slept past dawn . I knew , because I was one of the people she started phoning around six . In fact , in the past few months I had become something of a reluctant expert on the life of Audrey Coopersmith . For the mother of a high school senior , Audrey was young : thirty-eight . Her house was full of books . Despite marrying and dropping out of college at twenty , she was self-educated and extraordinarily well read . Rather than take direct care of herself , she took in strays : extra kittens other people could n't give away , guinea pigs , hamsters and rabbits left over at the end of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She also exercised fanatically at both the athletic club and the local recreation center . But the shelves of books , the cadre of pets , the soft body that  | refused to become fit , had been no help , she had sadly announced at a meeting of Amour Anonymous , our support group for women who felt they were addicted to relationships . After two years of denial , Audrey Coopersmith had finally begun divorce proceedings against her husband of eighteen years . With a deviousness that had fooled no one but Audrey , Carl Coopersmith had been supporting another woman in Denver for the past fifteen years . This other woman had children by a previous marriage , but Carl had been hanging around for so long that the other woman 's kids called him Dad and the other woman 's neighbors all thought " Dad " was the other woman 's husband . Which , when it came to financial support , made for a very confusing situation for everyone but the lawyers . With delays , requests for documents , filing motions and countermotions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line was , Carl " Dad " Coopersmith had cancelled Audrey 's cash card , credit cards , and provided a copious supply of lies about his salary and other accounts . The court order on permanent support for Audrey and their daughter , Heather , was supposed to come down any moment . But as was typical , it had been delayed three times . Two months ago Audrey had asked me for part-time work . She could n't earn too much , she told me , for that would undermine what she was asking from Carl . But she was having trouble making ends meet . She balanced the work she had from me with a part-time job at the Tattered Cover , Denver 's largest bookstore , a place she claimed to love . But as you might expect , Audrey was always exhausted , always broke , always un-happy . The one bright spot in her life was super-achieving Heather , an eighteen-year-old science whiz who ranked third in the senior class at Elk Park Prep . To my utter dismay , there were only two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIT , and for Carl to come to his senses , leave the other woman , her kids , and her neighbors , and return to their home in Aspen Meadow Country Club .  | Now , this was a woman who was addicted to a relationship . Not to mention that she did n't have too firm a grasp on reality . Audrey desperately wanted to return to the status quo . In Amour Anonymous , we had all tried to enlighten her , to no avail . Sometimes people just have to go through things . The phone had not even rung one full time when she answered . Once she realized I was n't Carl , her voice went from lively to remote . Yes , she remembered that she was supposed to help me with the football party . But then she remembered that she was supposed to make a stir-fry for a small staff meeting after she filled in at the bookstore that afternoon . I said , " Filled in ? " She gave a short laugh . " Best department . " " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-improvement . " So I asked if she could help with the church refreshments instead , and I 'd see if I could get someone else for the Dawsons ' party in the afternoon . She agreed and added that she had to get off the phone because for some reason the police were at her door . For some reason . I hung up . So Headmaster Perkins had already given the police Audrey 's name . But that surely would not be the end of it . I looked out my kitchen window at lodgepole pine branches heavy with snow . A number of Elk Park Prep parents were Episcopalians . By the time of the service , the investigative team already would have visited some of them . The official interrogations , not to mention Keith 's bizarre death , would be guaranteed topics of conversation during the church coffee hour . Cook , I ordered myself , you 'll feel better . I folded shiny slivers of orange zest into a pillowy spongecake batter to make Bronco-fan cupcakes for the Dawsons ' brunch . When the cupcakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple plums for a Happy Endings Plum Cake , a prototype for Caroline Dawson , who had promised to taste it at church . If she and I lank liked the cake , they 'd said I could sell them at their restaurant , the : Aspen Meadow .  | For the rest of the church refreshments , I sliced two dozen risp Granny Smith apples into bird-shaped centerpieces that would be surrounded by concentric circles of Gouda and cheddar wedges . I did n't even want to think about the price of the cheeses in this little spread . I reminded myself that this was an advertising opportunity , even if it was church . To complete the cheese tray , I cut several loaves of fragrant homemade oatmeal bread into triangles and threw in a wheel of Jarlsberg for good measure . Advertising could get expensive . Arch dressed with minimal complaining , since he did n't want to wake up Julian , who was snoring deeply . The wind bit through our clothing as we climbed into the van . The sky was luminescent , like the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the going slow . By the time we arrived at the ig stone church with its great diamond-shaped windows , the parking lot was already half filled with Cadillacs , Rivieras , and Chrysler New Yorkers , with the occasional Mercedes , Lexus , and Infiniti . I scanned the parking lot for my ex-husband 's Jeep with its N license plate , but he was not making one of his rare church appearances . The personalized tags indicated who had already rrived . The Dawsons ' matching vans advertised the presence of parents and offspring . Greer Dawson was known to her volleyball teammates as G.D. , the Hammer , hence the tag GD HMR . Her parents ' more sedate tag read AMCAFE , for the Aspen Meadow Cafe . There was MR E , from a local mystery writer , and R4GVN , from who else ? The priest . I pulled in next to the gold Jaguar belonging to Marla Korman , my best friend , who also happened to he Dr. John Richard Korman 's other ex-wife . Her license tag said simply , AVLBL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our hitters , Marla shrieked a greeting and rushed across the foyer sward us . Large in body and spirit , Marla always dressed according to the season . This morning , an early appearance of winter demanded a silver suede suit sprinkled with an abundance of  | Happy Endings Plum Cake 1 cup ( 2 sticks ) unsalted butter 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 ' /2 cups all-purpose flour ( high altitude : add 2 tablespoons ) 2 teaspoons baking powder ( high altitude : subtract ' /2 teaspoon ) 1 teaspoon baking soda ' /2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 16-ounce can purple plums packed in syrup , well drained , the syrup reserved and the plums chopped confectioners ' sugar Preheat the oven to 400 ? . In a large mixing bowl , beat the butter until creamy and light , then gradually add the sugars , beating until creamy and smooth . Beat in the eggs , then the vanilla . Sift the flour , baking powder , baking  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry ingredients into the butter mixture , alternating with ' /z cup reserved syrup , beginning and ending with dry ingredients . Stir in the plums . Pour the batter into a buttered 9- by 13-inch pan . Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean . Turn the cake out onto a rack and allow it to cool , then dust with confectioners ' sugar . Makes 12 to 16 servings.  | pewter buttons across a jacket and skirt . Sparkly silver barrettes , my gift for her fortieth birthday , held back her eternally frizzed brown hair . She folded me in a hug that was all bangle bracelets and soft leather . " What in the hell happened out at that school last night ? " she hissed in my ear . " How did you find out about it ? " " What , are you kidding ? My phone started ringing at sixthirty this morning ! " The organist sounded the opening notes of a Bach fugue . I whispered back , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Help me in the kitchen afterward and I 'll tell you what I know . " Marla told me she had visitors she had promised to sit with during the service , but that she could help later with the food . Then she whispered , " I heard this kid stole credit cards . " " He did not , " said Arch in a very loud voice behind us . " He was nice . " At this , heads in the pews swiveled to stare at us . The Bach was in full swing . Marla lifted her double chin in an imperial gesture . I pretended not to know either of them and hustled the first bird-apple centerpiece out to the church kitchen . We mumbled along through the service until the passing of the peace , when you wish the priest God 's peace and then turn to your neighbors and wish them the same . But in this parish the peace was a signal to pass along news , commentary on weather , parish illnesses and absences , and so on , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the peacediscussion this day was devoted to the events out at Elk Park Prep . When Arch and I had politely shaken the hands of all those around us , Marla surprised us by squeezing into our pew . She said accusingly , " You did n't tell me you found him ! After the dinner ! Did you know the police have already been around to question some of the parents ? I hear they suspect that kid living with you . You know , Julian . " " What ? Who told you that ? "  | " I just heard it , " she replied with a shrug of silver suede . " I ca n't remember who told me . Oh , look , Father Olson 's giving us the sanctimonious eye . Ca n't talk now . " During the final hymn I noticed that Audrey Coopersmith had slipped in sometime during the service . She stood , statuelike , in the last pew with her arms clamped across her chest . Her face was fatigued , but carefully made up , and she wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her separation , Audrey had been inclined to wear oversize chamois shirts and gray pants that looked as if they 'd been issued for postal service employees . She carried a purse only rarely , favoring instead a wallet in her back pocket and a chunk of keys dangling from a belt loop . Now , although everyone around her was singing , she was not . Her dark eyes were half closed . I wondered if she was praying for Carl 's return or for self-improvement . On the other hand , maybe these were mutually exclusive . While the acolytes snuffed the altar candles , I signaled to Audrey and we quickly set up a table at the back of the church . Then I tried to spot Caroline Dawson in the bustle . The last thing I needed was for the plum cake to be decimated before she even got to sample it . Audrey trundled up to one of the . counters , her mouth turned down in a deep-set scowl . Above the cheerful din from the foyer , she said , " Greer Dawson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said I did n't know anything about it . She said , Well , you just better go check , then . ' " Audrey fluttered her free hand against her chest . " Why does n't she ask Greer ? She could n't even manage to help us last night , why ca n't she pitch itt this morning ? Or is actual catering too difficult for the Ham-mer ? " " Audrey , " I said in a placating tone , " Greer was listening to the program last night , just like Heather , just like Julian . Let me deal with Caroline Dawson . " Audrey grunted . Of course , she had a point . Greer D. , the Hammer , was  | interested in working for me only as a way to appear wellrounded to admissions folks . I did n't see why Greer could n't round herself out working at the family cafe , but perhaps the Ivy League frowns on nepotism . Anyway , Audrey was correct in saying Greer hardly ever managed to fit working for me into her busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents before I had wowed them with my baking . I handed an unsmiling Audrey a cheese tray . The enticing smell of cinnamon wafted up from the moist slices of plum cake . As I picked up the cake platter and headed for the Dawsons , I decided that the last thing I 'd want to put on my college application was that working in food service had made inc well rounded . " Ooo , 000 , 000 , " crooned Marla when I breezed out into the foyer . She cast a greedy eye on the cake . " I still want to hear about last night . And let me tell you , Father Olson is in love with the spread . He already asked me if I thought you 'd cater a highpowered clergy meeting . " " As long as he pays for it , I 'm his . " " This is the church , honey . " Marla pinched a piece of cake and popped it into her mouth . " He 's not going to pay for any-thing . " She chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here come Hank and Caroline Dawson , " she said under her breath , " the king and queen of the short people . They 'll eat anything in sight . " " Hey ! " I protested . " I 'm short ! And I resent ? " " Behold your monarchs , then , " Marla said with a lift of her chin . " They 're right behind you . " The Dawson parents swept up to me . Hank 's look was knowing . He said , " Big game today . You nervous ? " I eyed him . Hank Dawson was a square-set man  --  square , leathery face with a sharply angled jaw , square shoulders , square Brooks Brothers gray suit . I lis short salt-and-pepper hair , reced-  | ing hairline , and quickly appraising Delft-blue eyes all said : Nononsense Republican here . When we could avoid the topic of how brilliant Greer was , Hank and I chatted knowingly after church about the upcoming Bronco games . We were hard-core fans who kept a separate orange outfit for Sunday afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own commentary , and had a standing prescription for stomach medication when the playoff season began . Talking shop with Hank after the Episcopal church service was like finding your kinsman who speaks Zulu in the middle of North Dakota . " Nah , " I replied . " The Vikings are sunk . " " You 're right . The Vikings are sunk without Bud Grant . " " The Vikings have been sunk since Fran Tarkenton het i red . " " Still , " persisted Hank , " you have to worry about any team hat can sustain a two-minute offense for a whole quarter . " " Hank . That was years ago . " " Yeah . " He looked reassured . " That was Bud Grant 's last year . " Then we said our refrain in unison , " And we have Elway . " " Excuse me ! " shrilled Caroline Dawson . You see , they always get upset when you speak Zulu . I suddenly wished I were trying to sell the Bronco-orange cupcakes to the cafe , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly saccharine smile to Caroline . The queen of the short people touched the buttons of her scarlet Chanel-style suit , which was only a shade darker than the burgundy silk of the night before . Marla had once pointed out to me that this particular hue was favored by women in their late fifties . She had dubbed it menopause red . Standing , Caroline resembled a squat , heavy column abandoned by the Greeks . The two I ) awsons reminded me of Arch 's old square and round blocks that had to he hammered through the right holes . " Does n't that look lovely , " Caroline murmured as she  | reached for a large slice . " I do hope it tastes as good as it looks . " She gobbled it down and shoved another into her mouth . Hank picked the bars up and ate them two at a time . Mouth full , Caroline finally commented , " That was quite a dinner last night . Of course , Greer does n't really need their college counseling . She has her pick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well . I 'm glad you enjoyed the dinner . Actually , it was very successful until the end . " They both looked astonished . Was it possible someone had not heard ? Quickly , I explained about finding Keith Andrews . I prayed silently that the police did not arrive to ask their questions during the Bronco game today . " My God , " exclaimed Hank Dawson . I think he had just swallowed his eighth slice . He turned to his wife . " Remember what Greer said after the state volleyball championships ? " Caroline took another bite . Then she smiled primly . " I think I was too excited to notice . " Eagerly , Hank turned back to me to explain . " Of course you know our daughter is responsible for the Elk Park Prep volleyball team being state champions . " " My heartfelt congratulations . " Hank narrowed one eye skeptically . " Anyway , after the final game , Greer did mention to us this rumor that Keith Andrews was having trouble with drugs . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost my grip on the plum cake platter just as Caroline reached for the last slice , approximately her tenth . " Drugs ? Keith Andrews did n't seem like the type . " Hank shrugged , world-wise . " The kind that seems the type rarely is . You know , Goldy , that 's been true for the team too . " We shook our heads together over the unspoken name of a firmer Bronco tight end . He had tested positive for cocaine three times in the last year , and had been banned from pro football . An All-Pro player too . At the time , I lank and I had agreed that the state flag  | should have been flown at half mast . " Take the headmaster 's son , Macguire , " Hank said after our moment of silence . " He looks innocent as can be , but I understand that kid 's had quite a history with substance abuse . " " Substance abuse ? " Marla sidled up to us with a tray . " What a nice shade of red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you where I got it if you 'd like , Marla . " Caroline and Hank reached simultaneously for cupcakes from Marla 's tray . " Oh , " trilled Marla , " I do n't think I need shopping ad-vlrc " Mrs. Dawson , " I interjected briskly , " do you like this cake enough to sell it in your cafe ? " Caroline puckered her lips and closed her eyes . For an intam , she looked like one of those little Chinese demons who rings you nothing but rotten luck . " Not really , " she murmured . Sorry , Goldy . We do appreciate what you 're doing for Greer , though . We 'll see you in a couple of hours . " And off she and her square husband plodded , licking the last cupcake crumbs off their ngcrs as they departed . " Was that a rejection ? " I asked Marla . " No , no , my dear , the royal short people have cleaned the trays . Now they need to talk to some other Episcopalians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not remember the overdressed couple the Dawsons were now chatting with as being particularly religious . Marla said , " You know , Goldy . England . " Under her breath , she added , " My question is , if she did n't like it , why 'd she have so many pieces ? " I certainly did not know . I checked on the serving table , where Audrey had deftly kept the platters refilled . Across the room , Arch caught my eye . He was standing with the tall , skinny Marenskys , who were avoiding either me or the food or both . Stan and Rhoda Marensky were the kind of people caterers dislike most : They pick at their food , do n't finish it , and then complain about how expensive it is . At that moment Stan was  | interrogating Arch , who shot me an imploring look that meant : Can we go ? I held up my hand : Five minutes . Then I motioned him over . The Marenskys turned their backs . " Has the headmaster 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by my side . Arch pushed his glasses up on his nose . A bit of cheese hung on the corner of his mouth . I pinched a paper napkin and wiped it off . " Do you mind ? " Arch leaned away from my ministrations . " Tell me about Macguire , the headmaster 's son . And his trouble . " Arch shrugged noncommitally . " Well , he 's kind of a goofoff . I mean , with a dad like that , can you blame him if he 's weird ? I do n't think he 's allowed to drive anymore . Listen , Mom , people are n't saying very nice things about Keith today . Like he deserved to die or something . " " Who 's saying that , the Marenskys ? " " Oh , I guess . Them and other people . " Another shrug . Arch , like Julian , would n't tattle if his life depended on it . " I 'm telling you , Keith was a great guy . Even though he was a senior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Arch reached for another cupcake . " I know , I know , " I said , and felt a mother 's pang over the way kids treated small-built , nonathletic Arch . Marla sashayed up grandly . She had a piece of torte in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other . She gestured grandly with her coffee cup . " Van Gogh must have had to listen to people argue about the Ivy League . That 's why he came home and cut off his ear . " I shook my head . " Just go have a listen-in on the conversation between the Dawsons and Audrey Coopersmith . Caroline was going on about grade point average being less important than extracurricular activities . Audrey replied that besides volleyball , the only outside interest Greer Dawson has ever shown was in clothes . So Caroline  | said , now that you mention it , maybe dear daughter Greer could give Audrey 's daughter , Heather , a few pointers in that department . For that matter  --  Caroline threw in , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey herself could use a little advice in the fashion department . " I groaned . " Poor Audrey . As if she did n't have enough to deal with . " " Do n't worry , " said Marla . " I told Father Olson we needed a referee for a coffee hour argument . He said , Oh , theology or ethics ? And I said , academics . He nodded . Said he learned all about it in seminary . " " Really ? " But before Marla could elaborate , the head of the Altar Guild came up and asked me to start clearing the serving table , as there was going to be a meeting in the parish hall after church . Arch sidled off . To my relief , the cheese was almost gone , the plum cake was crumbs , and the bird centerpieces had been reduced to a few slices of apple-feather . " Oh , Goldy ! " Father Olson 's face glowed with pleasure . " ' Phis was marvelous ! And it gave rise to such a lively coffee hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luncheonministry for the Board of Theological Examiners ? I 'm sorry to say at we ca n't really afford to ? " " No thanks ! " I called back gaily , scooping up the last of the Gouda . " I 'm all booked for the next three months . " This was not entirely true . But clients have to be willing to pay for their bread . I had a child to support . " . . . just do n't understand why you think your daughter is the only one qualified . . . " Hank Dawson was gesticulating with a wedge of Gouda . As he chided Audrey Coopersmith , his tone was judgmental . " We have looked into this extensively ? " Caroline Dawson was nodding as she stuffed the last of a cupcake into her mouth . The lapels of her red suit quivered in indignation . She swallowed and continued her husband 's thought .  | " Why , just the other day I was speaking with the director of admissions at ? " " And you think that makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed with ferocity . " You do n't know the first thing about the value of an education . " She paused , and I felt myself chilled by the intensity of the dark-eyed glare she directed at the bewildered Caroline Dawson . Audrey 's words erupted like a spray of bullets . " You think Ben Jonson is a Canadian runner . You , you " ? she paused , grasping for another insult ? " you think Heidegger is a box you carry to detect radiation ! " So saying , Audrey whacked her tray down on the table and stomped out the wooden door of the church . Her chain of keys made a loud chinking sound when the edge of the door caught them . She did n't stop to tell me good-bye . She did n't even take off her apron .  | k other Olson tugged on his beard . " I do wish she had n't made of of Heidegger . . . " Oh , " I said sympathetically . " She 's going through a bad Father Olson moved off to smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know whether Audrey needed understanding , self-improvement , or a brand-new outlook on life . tit she sure needed something . Pain seeped out of her like water nn a leaking dam . I resolved to say a few carefully chosen olds of ' support the next time we worked together . Carefully chosen , because Arch always said that what I thought of as supportt was giving somebody the Heimlich maneuver when all they 'd done was hiccup .  | Hank Dawson nodded at Father Olson and maneuvered his way back to me . " Is n't Ben Jonson a Canadian runner ? " His brow furrowed . " Yes , of course . Named after a sixteenth-century playwright , perhaps . " " Who does that woman think she is ? " " Well , she was upset . .. " Hank Dawson poured himself another cup of coffee and blew on it . He looked down his broad nose at me . " Audrey Coopersmith has distressed my wife . " This from the fellow who the night before had given me that classic henpecked look : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe the more distress Audrey created for Caroline Dawson , the more there was for Mr. Caroline Dawson . " Well , Hank . . . " " Listen . Audrey 's just jealous because of how gifted our Greer is . Heather is good in math and science , period . Greer , mind you , has been making up stories since she was eight . She excels in languages and is an athlete , to boot . She 's well-rounded , and that 's what they 're all looking for , you know that . Heather and Greer in a contest ? That 's not a game , it 's a rout . " " Of course , " I said soothingly . " But you know we all feel so protective of our children . Especially after what happened last night . " Hank swirled the coffee around and regarded me with his stern ice-blue eyes . " Oh , tell roe ! Nine thousand bucks a year , and then you tell me you find a dead body after a dinner at the headmaster 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is within earshot , " I murmured . Hank lifted a jaw that was so sharp it would have cut an Italian salami . He spat out his words . " Of all times for that school to get caught up in a s candal , this is the worst . These kids have their senior years , college applications , all that coming up . And what business does Attelrey Cooper-smith " - the blue eyes blazed as his voice rose - " who has never done a thing with her life , have  | judging our daughter ? Greer placed fifth in the state in the National French Contest . She 's written poems . . . she went to a writers ' conference and studied with the writer-in-residence at Harvard . " " Greer 's wonderful , wonderful , " I lied . " Everybody thinks so . The king of the short people grunted , turned on his heel , and walked off . The strange part about Audrey 's outburst was that within ten minutes Caroline Dawson had a change of heart  --  not toward Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward my plum cake . Wanted to show she was n't all snob , I guess . Before the stragglers had left the church coffee hour , when I was cleaning up the last bird-built-of-apple slices , she bustled over and announced she 'd changed her mind . What could she possibly have been thinking ? Of course they 'd love to have me sell plum cakes at the cafe . They were absolutely delicious , and would go over wonderfully with their clientele . Should we start with six a week ? Oh , definitely , I 'd replied meekly . The cake go-ahead wrapped me in a small cloud of good feeling , so I rashly informed Father Olson I 'd do his clergy meeting if the church could pay for my labor and supplies . His right hand combed his beard in Moses-like fashion . He murmured that heel check with the diocesan office . The clergy meeting was this coining Friday , and as the church bulletin announced , they were going to discuss faith and penance . So could I think of something appropriate ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ? Then I assured him a penitential meal was no problem . I even had a recipe for something called Sorry Cake . When Arch and I got home , Julian sat in the kitchen sipping his version of cafe au lait , a cup of hot milk flavored with a tablespoon of espresso . He said he 'd called for a window-repair person to come out tomorrow , and he was n't in the mood to do his homework , so could he help with the choucroute for the Bronco lunch ? He also said I 'd had six calls : two hang-ups and  | four with messages . The messages were from the headmaster , Tom Schulz , Audrey Coopersmith , and my ex-husband , who sure sounded pissed off about something . Nothing new there . But two hang-ups ? " Did these anonymous callers say anything at all ? " Julian tilted back in one of the kitchen chairs . " Nope . I just said , Hello ? Hello ? This is Goldilocks ' Catering , who 're you ? ' And all I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me turned suddenly chill . Could it be the same prankster who had smashed our window last night ? What if Arch had taken those calls ? Was someone casing my house ? Best to tell Schulz about this . But I had someone else to call first . I reached for the phone ; my ex-husband picked up after four rings . The Jerk 's uninflected voice , the one he used to try to show he was above feeling , said only that he 'd been trying to get me all morning . I asked if he 'd been around our house last night , maybe with a rock ? He said , " What do you think I am , crazy ? " Well , I was n't going to answer that one . I asked what he wanted . Only this : Because of the early snow , he wanted to go skiing this coming weekend , his time to take Arch . He wanted to pick him up at Elk Park Prep early on Halloween , this Friday , to beat the rush . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my cheek . Since our weekend visitation arrangement did not include Friday , John Richard had to check with me about Arch 's leaving school early . Of course , this checking actually meant announcing his plans and then waiting to see if I would get upset . Who , me ? But I was concerned Arch might have other plans for Halloween . If Arch agreed , John Richard would no doubt take him to his condo in Keystone . His dad had had the locks changed , Arch had reported to me , to make sure I never used the place on the sly . Why should I be upset ? Fine , I told John Richard , just let me check with Arch . I did n't even say what went through my mind , that some people had to work on Hallowcen . Or at least , like the Board of Theological  | Examiners , be penitent . But John Richard fit into neither of those categories , so I hung up . I phoned Headmaster Perkins next , but got his son . Macguire acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hi . That was pretty heavy last night . You okay ? " When I replied in the affirmative , he said , " Dad said to tell you he 'd like to see you . Tomorrow . Just come into the office anytime , and , uh , bring some coat . " He thought for a minute . " Tell him you just dropped in , you know , like a . . . meteorite . " I told him to expect a hit about ten the next morning , and hung up . Before I could dial Schulz , the phone rang . " Goldilocks ' Catering , " I chirped , " where everything is just right ! " Breathing . " Hey ! " I yelled . " Who is this ? " A dial tone , then nothing . I pressed Schulz 's number . " How 's my favorite caterer ? " he said with a chuckle when I had greeted him . " You mean your only caterer . " " Oops . She 's in a bad mood . Must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and someone heaved a rock through one of our winows last night . Plus I just had an anonymous call , third one of r morning . He snorted . " The ex up to his old tricks ? " " He says no . The security alarm went off when the rock tunic through , and Arch handled it . The calls worry me . " " You going to let the phone company know ? " " Yes , yes , of course . But what scares me is that these things happened right after the Keith Andrews thing . Maybe there 's a connection . I wish I 'd never found him . I wish I 'd never gotten involved . But I did and I am , in case you do n't recall . " " I do , I ( 1o , Miss G. Take it easy , that 's why I called you . There was a message on my voice mail from you , remember ? You did n't want to wake me up , but you 'd found something . "  | I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raccoon coat . He asked for the number . I fished around for the card , then repeated the numerals . He said , " Do n't return the card with the coat . Can you bring it over tomorrow ? Stay for dinner ? " " Love to . " I felt guilty for speaking sharply to him . Softening , I said , " Why do n't you come here ? I 'll probably have a ton of leftover bratwurst . Then if we get an anonymous call , you can bawl the person out yourself . " " How about this . . . give the sausage to the boys and come out to my place around six . I need to talk to you alone . " His tone made me smile . " Sounds interesting . " " It would be if it were about us , " Schulz replied reluctantly . " But this is about Julian . " Great . I said I 'd be there and hung up . Packing up the choucroute , I remembered Audrey Coopersmith . Doggone it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers for the bookstore , where I asked for the self-improvement department . Part of psychology , I was told . Hmm . " Oh , God , Goldy , " Audrey said breathily when we were connected . " I 'm so glad you called . I 'm a wreck . First the police and then those damn Dawsons at the church , plus I got this terrible letter yesterday from Carl 's lawyer ? " " Please , " I interrupted , but nicely , " you know I 've got this Bronco thing at the Dawsons ? " " Oh , well , I 've got a huge problem . We 're having a seminar , Getting Control of Your Life , tonight and I promised to do a little stir-fry for the staff after the store closes at five and before we reopen at seven , and what with the police asking all those questions , I forgot all about the stir-fry , and they have plates and stuff ' here , but I do n't have any food and I was just wondering if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stretched the phone cord , opened the door to my walk-in refrigerator , and perused the contents . " 1 low many people ? " " Fight .  | " Any vegetarians ? " " None , I already checked . And we 've taken up a collection , live dollars per person . I 'll give you all the money and buy you any cookbook you want , plus do the serving and cleanup myself . . . . " Relief and glee filled her voice , and I had n't even said yes . " Okay , but it 'll be simple , " I warned . " Simple is what they want , it 's part of getting control of your life . " I made an unintelligible sound and said I 'd be down after the Bronco game . After some thought I got out two pounds of steak , then swished together a wonderfully pungent marinade of pressed garlic , sherry , and soy sauce . Once the beef had defrosted slightly under cold running water , I cut it into thin slices , sloshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choucroute and trimmings . I could n't shake the feeling , however , that it was going to be a long half-time luncheon . At the Dawsons ' enormous wood-and-glass home , there was much discussion of the artificial turf inside Minneapolis ' domed stadium . My appearance caused only a momentary pause in the downing of margaritas and whiskey sours and the assessment of Viking strategy . Caroline Dawson , still wearing her red suit , waddled in front of Arch , Julian , and me out to the kitchen . It was the cleanest , most impeccably kept culinary space I had ever inhabited . When I complimented her on how immaculate everything was , she gave me a startled look . " Is n't your kitchen clean ? " Without waiting for an answer , she peeked underneath the plastic wrap of one of my trays . I thought it was to check how clean it was until her chubby fingers emerged with a crust of potato-caraway bread . She popped the bread into her mouth , chewed , and said , " Hank and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dust- and dirt-free  | environment . You know we asked you to cater this meal because , well , we 're busy with the guests , and you do have a good reputa-tion ? " Then she scuttled out , but not without filching another slice of bread . Julian , Arch , and I began to prepare the meal in earnest . But if I thought we would be uninterrupted , I was wrong . Rhoda Marensky , as thin and leggy as an unwatered rhododendron , sauntered out first . It was well known in town that statuesque Rhoda , now fifty , had been a model for Marensky Furs before Stan Marensky married her . For the Bronco get-together , she wore a chartreuse knit sweater and skirt trimmed with fur in dots and dashes , as if the minks had been begging for help in Morse code . She stood in an exaggerated slouch to appraise Julian . " Well , my boy , " she said with undisguised wickedness , " you must have finished your SAT review early , if you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped spooning out sauerkraut , pressed his lips together , and gulped . Arch looked from Julian to me . " Unlike some people , " I replied evenly , " Julian does n't need to review . " Rhoda snorted loudly and writhed in Julian 's direction , a female Uriah Heep . She put her hand on the sauerkraut spoon handle so that he was forced to look at her . " Salutatorian ! And our Brad tells me you 've never even been in a gifted program . Where was it you 're from , somewhere in Utah ? " " Tell me , " I wondered aloud , " what kind of name is Marensky anyway ? Where is it from , Eastern Europe ? " Bitchy , I know , but sometimes you have to fight fire with a blowtorch . Besides , skinny people seldom appreciate caterers . " The Marenskys were a branch of the Russian royal family , " Rhoda retorted . " Wow ! Cool ! " interjected my impressionable son . I glanced at the butcher knife on the counter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or is that technically a vein ? "  | That did it . Rhoda slithered out . A moment later her husband strode into the kitchen . Stan Marensky almost tripped over Arch , who scooted out of his path and grimaced . I tried not to groan . Stan 's long , deeply lined face , oversize mouth , and lanky frame always reminded me of a racehorse . He was as slender as his wife , but much more nervous . Must have been all that Russian blood that would n't clot . " What did you say to my wife about blood ? " he demanded . " Blood ? Nothing . She must have been thinking of the football game . " And out went Stan . Arch giggled . Julian stared at me incred-ulously . " Man , Goldy , chill ! You 've always told me you have to be so nice , especially to rich people , so you can get more bookings . . . and here you are just dumping on the Marenskys ? " Caroline Dawson interrupted his rebuke by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short people put her hands on her wide hips ; her crimson body shook with rage . " What is taking so long ? If I had known you three were going to be out here having a gab fest , I would have had Greer help you , or , or . . . I would have brought in help from the cafe ? " " Not to worry ! " I interrupted her merrily and hoisted a tray with platters of steaming sausages . " We 're holding our own . Let 's go see how our team 's doing , " I ordered the boys . Julian mutely lifted his tray with the sauerkraut and potatocaraway bread . Arch carefully took hold of the first serving dish of ' warmed applesauce . We served the food graciously and received a smattering of compliments . The Marenskys regarded us haughtily as they picked at their food , but ventured no more critical comments . On the big-screen television , brilliant close-up shots made the football playing surface look like tiny blades . Happily , Denver won by two touchdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faked field goal attempt . I predicted both plays in addition to serving the food .  | Hank Dawson , flushed and effusive , reminded me I was booked again for next week 's game . He brandished a wad of bills that amounted to our pay plus a twenty-five percent tip . I was profusely thankful and divided the gratuity with Arch and Julian . Unfortunately , I knew that next week the Broncos were playing the Redskins in Washington . Maybe I could split the tip over two weeks . We arrived home just before five . Early darkness pressed down from the sky , a reminder , like the recent snow and cold , of win-ter 's rapid approach . Julian stared out the kitchen window and said maybe he should stay home and do SAT review instead of doing stir-fry at the Tattered Cover . Inwardly , I cursed Rhoda Marensky . Arch said he wanted to come along when I told him we 'd be cooking on the fourth floor , usually closed to the public . " Cool ! Do they , like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff like that ? " " None of the above , " I assured him as I packed up the ingredients . " Probably just a lot of desks and boxes of books . And a little kitchen . " " Maybe I should take my wardrobe with the fake back for the C. S. Lewis display . Oh , Julian , please come with me so you can help me carry it . I know they have a secret closet there , did you ? Do you think they 'll use my display ? I mean , if Julian helps me set it up ? " He looked with great hope first at Julian , then me . I was afraid , as mothers always are , that the voice of expedience ? " They probably have all the displays they need " ? would be interpreted as rejection . I said reflectively , " Why do n't we ask them when we get there ? " He seemed satisfied . Julian decided his homework and the SAT review could wait . He helped Arch load the plywood ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients . ( ) n the way to Denver , I decided to broach the topic of Arch 's week  | end . Despite his basically nonathletic nature , he had learned to ski at an early age and enjoyed the sport quite a bit . For Halloween , I asked , did he want to ski early with his father , go out for trick-ortreat , what ? " I do n't have any friends from Elk Park Prep to go trick-ortreating with , " he replied matter-of-factly . " Besides , if Dad wants to ski  --  wait ! I could go around in his condo building ! " " And dress up as . . . ? " Julian asked . " Galileo , what else ? " I grinned as we pulled into the bookstore 's parking garage . Audrey was waiting for us in her silver van by the third-floor store entrance . She hopped out and swiped her security card through the machine next to the door . Arch , a security nut , had her repeat the process , which he studied with furrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping us haul in the electric wok and bags of ingredients , Audrey said the store was empty for the two-and-a-half-hour break between closing and reopening for the seminar . The other seven staff members present were doing some last-minute preparation . . . dinner was planned for six-forty , and she 'd already started cooking some rice she 'd found in a cupboard . . . was that okay ? " Is now a good time to ask her about the wardrobe ? " Arch whispered to me in the elevator to the fourth floor . We had fifteen minutes before cooking had to begin . I nodded ; Arch made his request . " A wardrobe with a false back ! " Audrey cried . " You 're so creative ! Just like Heather . . . why , I remember when she was nine , she loved C. S. Lewis too . How old are you ? " Arch reddened and said he was twelve . Audrey shrugged and plowed ahead . " When Heather was nine , she wanted a planetary voyager liar Christmas , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , one sumnmer she built a time-travel machine with little electric gizmos right in our backyard . . . . " Arch rolled his eyes at me ; Julian cleared his throat and Iooked away . I think Audrey caught the look , because she stopped  | abruptly and gnawed her lip . " Well , Arch , I 'm sorry , but we probably ca n't , " she said plaintively . " I mean , I ca n't authorize you putting up a false-back display , somebody might get hurt . . . . " Arch looked disappointed , but then piped up , " Can I see the secret closet , then ? I know you have one , a kid at school told me . " " Uh , I suppose , " Audrey said , hesitating , " but it is n't exactly The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . Are you sure ? " Arch replied with an enthusiastic affirmative . Arch , Julian , Audrey , and I unloaded the supplies and rode down to the first floor . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf . In back was a small closet . Arch insisted on being closed into it . His muffled voice said , " Yeah , it 's cool all right ! Now let me out . " This we did . Satisfied , he returned to the fourth floor with us and minutes later was stringing snow peas to go in the stir-fry under Julian 's direction . As I heated oil in the electric wok , Arch said , " Did you do stuff like that during the summer when you were nine , Mom ? Make a time-travel machine ? " Julian snorted . I replied , " The only thing I did during the summer when I was nine was swim in the ocean and eat something called fire-balls . " Arch pushed his glasses up on his nose and nodded , considering . Finally he said , " Okay . I guess I 'm not too dumb . " I gave him an exasperated look , which he returned . The oil was beginning to pop , so I eased in the marinated beef . The luscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , thank you , " gushed Audrey . " I do n't know what I would have done without you , I 've just been so stressed lately ? " " No problem . " I tossed the sizzling beef against the sides of the wok until the red faded to pink . When the beef slices were  | just tender , I eased them onto a platter and heated more oil for the broccoli , carrots , baby corn , and snow peas , an inviting palette of emerald , orange , and pale yellow . When the vegetables were hot and crisp , I poured on the oyster-sauce mixture , then added the beef and a sprinkling of chopped scallions . I served the whole hot steaming mass with the rice to Arch , Audrey , and her staff , who exclaimed over the fresh veggies ' crunchiness , the tenderness and rich garlic flavor of the steak . " I love to feed people , " I replied with a smile , and then wielded chopsticks into the goodies myself . On the way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced himself exhausted , and lay down in the back seat . He was snoring within seconds . Arch rambled in a conspiratorial tone about the upcoming weekend , skiing , the amount of loot he 'd collect trick-or-treating at his father 's condo , being able to see more constellations in Keystone because it was farther from the lights of Denver . He wanted to know , if I had n't read C. S. Lewis when I was his age , had I at least liked to look at stars ? Did I wait until it was dark to see Polaris , and could you see a lot of stars , living near the Jersey shore ? Like in the summertime , maybe ? I told him the only thing I looked forward to on summer evenings when I was his age was getting a popsicle from the Good I Humor man . " Oh , Mom ! Fireballs and popsicles ! All you ever think about is food ! " I took this as a compliment , and laughed . I wanted to ask him how school was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going in general , but experience had taught me he would interpret it as prying . Besides , he spared me the trouble as we chugged up the last portion of Interstate 70 that led to our exit . " Speaking of food , I 'm glad we had meat tonight , " my son whispered . " Sometimes I think eating that brown rice and tofu stuff is what makes Julian so unhappy .

I stretched through my yoga routine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket of clouds threatened the Front Range with  --  dreaded words  --  a chance of snow . The reason Coloradans do not use the eastern word autumn is that October offers either late summer or early winter , with precious little in between . I dressed and made espresso . Arch and Julian shuffled sleepily out of their room and joined me . I flipped thick , egg-rich slices of hot French toast for them and poured amber lakes of maple syrup all around . This perked them both up . After the boys left for school , I worked on my accounts , sent out some bills and paid some , ordered supplies for the upcoming week , and then took off for Elk Park Prep with the raccoon coat rolled into a furry ball on the front seat of my van . The winding driveway to the prep school had been paved and straightened out somewhat at the end of the summer . But the approach to the magnificent old hotel was still breathtaking . Several of the driveway 's curves even afforded glimpses of snowcapped peaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced the roadside hillocks of planted wildflowers to rustcolored stalks topped with wrinkled flowers in faded hues of blue and purple . As I rounded the last curve and rolled over speed bump number three , I noticed that the school had finished tearing down the chain-link fence around the pool construction site . In its place was a decorous stone wall surrounded by hemlock bushes . Looked like the administration did n't want kids thinking about swim ming with winter coming on . Over the summer Arch had nearly drowned in that damn pool . I did n't want to think about swim ming , either . I parked , grabbed the fur coat , and leaped out onto the iced driveway . Over by the headmaster 's house I could sec two police-  | men methodically sweeping the ground with metal detectors . I turned away . Someone had taped photocopied pictures of Keith Andrews onto the front doors of the school . Black crepe paper hung around each . The angelic , uncannily Arch-like face stared out from both flat photos . I closed my eyes and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in mid-game were perched on tables with their chairs left at hurriedly pulled-out angles . Piles of books and papers spilled off benches . Through this clutter threaded Egon Schlichtmaier , my muscular faculty assistant from the college dinner . Today he was conspicuously spiffy in a very un-Faustian sheepskin jacket . Next to him clomped the much less sartorial Macguire Perkins in a faded denim coat . Macguire 's acne-covered face had a dour expression ; Egon Schlichtmaier 's baby face was grim . They had just come in from outside , and they were in a hurry . " You heff made us late , " Egon was scolding . " So ? " retorted Macguire . " Ah , there you are , " trilled Headmaster Perkins at me . He approached in the tweed-of-the-day , a somber herringbone . With Mrs. Marensky 's coat . Wo n't she be happy . " Yes , wo n't she . Mr. Perkins escorted me into his office , a high-ceilinged affair that had been painted mauve to match one of the hues in the hand-cut Chinese rug that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intercom distracted him . I sat carefully on one of the burgundy leather sofas profuse with brass buttons . It let out a sigh . " You and me both , " I said under my breath . " Well ! " said the headmaster with a suddenness that startled inc . " Saturday night was indeed tragic . " From behind his hornrimmed glasses , Perkins ' eyes locked mine ; we had the abrupt intimacy of strangers thrown together by disaster . There was the mutual , if unwanted , need to come to terms with what had happened . His usually forced joviality had disappeared ; his anxiety  | was barely masked . " Awful , just awful , " he murmured . He jumped up restlessly and paced back and forth in front of the windows . Sunlight shone off his thick mass of prematurely white hair . " It was like a . . . a . . . " But for once the complicated similes would n't come . " As you can imagine , " he floundered , " our phones have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The press . . . " He gestured with his hands and lifted his pale eyebrows expressively . " We had an emergency faculty meeting this morning . I had to tell them you were the one who found the body . " I groaned . " Does this mean people are going to be calling me to find out what happened ? " Headmaster Perkins brushed a finger over one of the brass wall sconces before moving toward his Queen Anne  --  style desk chair , where he ceremoniously sat . " Not if you can tell me exactly what you saw , Mrs. Korman . That way , I can deal with those who want all the details . " Hmm . In a small town , people always wanted all the details , because everyone wanted to be the first one with the complete story . How many stitches did George need when he fell while rock-climbing ? Did Edward lose his house when he filed for bankruptcy ? Did they take out Tanya 's lymph nodes was n't the first time I 'd had some involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk as little as possible in these situations . Remembered details were for the police , not the gossip network . " Sorry , " I said with a slight smile , " you know as much as I do . But let me ask you a question . Who would have had the keys to your house to get in before I did that night ? " " Oh . " Perkins did n't bother to conceal his distaste . " We leave it open . This is an environment of trust . " Well , you could have fooled me . The receptionist buzzed once more . While Mr. Perkins was again deep in similes , I glanced around his office . The mauve walls held wood-framed  | degrees and pictures . The Hill School . B.A. from Columbia . M.A. , Yale . There was a large crackled-surface oil painting of a fix hunt , with riders in full Pink regalia hurtling over a fence . Another painting was of Big Ben . As if the life of Merrie Olde Englande were available in the Colorado high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prospective students and , more important , to their parents . Want these accoutreents and all they imply ? Go to this school . The headmaster finished up on the phone and laced his finrs behind his silvery-white hair . " I have a few more things to talk to you about , Mrs. Korman . We need to move the next colge advisory meeting off the school grounds . Too much anxiety would be aroused if we held it at my residence again , I fear . Can you stay flexible ? " " As a rubber band , " I said with a straight face . " And you do remember that the SATs are this coming Satrday morning ? You 're making a healthful treat , something hole grain ? " I nodded . How could I forget ? I would be bringing the Elk ; irk Prep seniors , as well as the visiting seniors from the local public high school , a buffet of breakfast-type treats , to be served fore the test . Better than skiing at Keystone any day , I thought urly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headmaster reflected , " although I do n't suppose that will make a difference . But t may spook them , " he added with a grin . Getting back to his old self . I waited . Perkins pulled off his ; Masses and polished them carefully . I said , " Well , if that 's all ? " " It is n't . " I squirmed on the sofa . He put on his glasses , narrowed his eyes , and puckered his lips in thought . Perkins said : " Your son Arch is having some problems . " Ringing assaulted my cars . Keeping my voice even , I said , " What kind of problems ? "  | " Academic as well as social , I 'm told . " To his credit , a shade of gentleness crept into Perkins ' tone . " Arch is failing social studies . Missing most of the assigned work , is my understanding . He seems quite unhappy . . . not swimming with the currents of scholastic life . Reading books outside of the curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course ? Social studies ? " The mother is always the last to know . " We wanted you to be aware of this before midterm grades come out next week . Parent conferences are scheduled in two weeks . When you come , you can ask Arch 's instructors yourself . " " Can I talk to his teachers now ? Do they know why this is happening ? " He shrugged . His gesture clearly said , This is not my responsibility . " The instructors can see you if it 's convenient . Remember , grades are only an indication of what young Arch is learning . Like the weather forecasts , this may mean a storm , but it may only be dark clouds . . . a wee disturbance in the stratosphere . " This last was accompanied by a wee , patronizing smile . " The instructors can see me if it 's convenient ? " I repeated . In public school , if you wanted to see a teacher , you got a conference , period . " Grades are like the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what this school is like ? Like . . . like . . . bottled water ! You pay more for it than the free stuff out of the tap , but there 's a lot less regulation ! And the product is awfully unpredictable ! " Perkins drew back . How dare I invade his field of metaphorical expertise ? I stood up and bowed slightly , my way of excusing myself without speaking . There was only one comfort in the whole infuriating experience : For the meteorological analysis of Arch 's academic progress it was John Richard , and not I , who was forking over nine grand a year .  | When I left the headmaster 's office , I noticed that ultra-thin , ultra-chic couple , Stan and Rhoda Marensky , hovering around the receptionist . This day , Rhoda 's fashionably short red hair stood in contrast to a blond-streaked fur jacket , the kind that looked as if the animals had their hair frosted . She stopped reading a framed article on the wall and turned a blank , prim face to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her raccoon coat or she was still stewing about my hemophilia comment . Stan , less like a clotheshorse than a horse who happened to k wearing clothes ( in this case a rumpled green suit ) , paced nervously . His lined face quivered ; his bloodshot eyes flicked nervously about the room . Ile looked at me , then away . Clearly , I was n't worth greeting .  | " I brought back your coat , " I announced loudly , not one to endure snubs lightly . " Hnh , " snorted Rhoda . She tilted her head back so she could look down her long nose at me , literally . " I suspected somebody had taken it . Compound grand theft with murder , why not ? " I could feel rage bubbling up for the second time in ten minutes . Now I really could n't wait to tell Schulz whose coat had someone else 's credit card tucked in its pocket . A dead somebody else , no less . We 'd see about insinuations . To the Marenskys , I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond directly to hostility . Instead , I purred , " How 's the fur store do-ing ? " Neither answered . The receptionist even stopped tapping on her computer keys for a moment to see if she had missed something . Was it possible that Marensky Furs , a family business that had been a Denver landmark for over thirty years , was n't doing so well ? The newspapers are always full of doom-and-gloom analyses for the Colorado economy . But Marla , who was a regular Marensky customer , would have told me if the trade in silver fox had taken a hit . Perhaps I should have asked how NeimanMarcus was doing . The bell clanged , signaling the end of the second academic period . I wanted to catch Arch between classes but was determined that if anyone was going to back down , it was going to he the Marenskys . Stan stopped pacing and shoved his hands deep into his pockets . He rocked back on the heels of his unpolished Italian loafers and regarded me . " Did n't I coach your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Little guy , right ? Kind of timid ? What 's he doing now , anything ? " " Building props from C. S. Lewis novels . " Stan Marensky continued to look at me as if I baffled him , or in some way presented an enigma . A wave of noisy students  | swelled down the hall . Stan Marensky said , " I understand Julian ' Idler lives with you now , does n't he ? " What was this , interrogation time ? If he could n't even tell me the status of the fur trade , what was I doing recounting the doings of our household ? I said merely , " Mmm . " We were saved from open warfare by the sudden appearance of Headmaster Perkins at his doorway . 1 le looked expectantly at the Marenskys , who turned in unison and made for the headmaster 's office . Odd . Two people did n't need to come in to pick up an old coat . Something else was going on . But as the door to the office closed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be privy to any confidences . The second bell rang . I asked the receptionist how to get to seventh-grade social studies and then walked pensively down one oI the long halls . Pictures of the old hotel before it had become a school hung between the bulletin boards and rows of metal lockers . In the first photograph you could see the lobby in its former glory . Once this had been an expanse of pink Colorado marble with replicas of classical statuary placed tastefully here and there . Now it was covered with dark industrial-grade carpet . Other pictures showed the wide halls to the guest suites ; still others , the suites themselves , lushly decorated with floral-patterned rugs , matching wallpaper , and egg-and-dart molding . The faded photos exuded an air of quiet luxury that was distinctly at odds with the bulletin boards stuffed with announcements , the battered lockers papered with pictures of rock stars , the throb of young voices pulsing from classrooms . Through the rectangle of glass in the door to his classroom , Arch was visible in the back row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pull-down screen . A shot of the Acropolis flickered on the screen , accompanied by some loud droning from the announcer , then a shot of the Colosseum . I could see the chalked words on the blackboard : Early Cities : Athens , Rome . Arch , turned away from the teacher , his legs splayed out in front of him , paid  | no heed . His glasses had ridden down on his nose as he hunched with a book held to the light from the projector . I did n't nee d t see the title : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , his current favorite . I fought a powerful instinct to slip in and lift the volume right out of his hands . He was flunking this class , for goodness ' sake . But I held back . I even managed not to rap on the door window and embarrass him . But then a sudden touch on my shoulder made me shriek . So much for my Mother of the Year Award : I lost my balance ; my forehead bonked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hastily , I drew back , but not= before I saw Arch put his head in his hands in embarrassments . " What is it ? " I demanded brusquely of Audrey Coopersmith , dressed this day in a periwinkle gabardine shirt and baggy pants complemented with hightop sneakers . She winced . The perfect curls shook slightly . " Sorry , " I said , and meant it . Support , I reminded myself . " What 're you doing here ? " " Delivering books . I 've just been to the headmaster 's office , but the secretary said you were here . " Her tone was tentative ; maybe she feared I would growl at her again . " Listen , that was a great stir-fry that you did . Thanks again . Anyway , after the so colt nar , one of the staff people said the bookstore was having .1 , . i . . . reading this Friday night . I thought I 'd talk to Perkins a-heat it this morning , but he 's in a meeting . The secretary let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notice was short ? " " Notice was short for what ? " I had a vision of stir-fry Ito. a hundred people . The last thing I needed was another job it n u already busy week . " The headmaster wants to use the reading as a college advisory thing . You and I would do the treats . After the reading , of course . " " Do n't tell me . Halloween ? Clive Barker . Stephen King . " " Nooooo , " Audrey said . She shifted her weight back and forth on her hightops ; the keys on her belt hook jingled . " It 's for r Mar-.  | shall Smathers . " To my look of confusion , she explained , " He wrote that best seller , Climbing the Ivy League . It gives tips for the admission process . " True horror . I asked , " Will the bookstore pay for the treats ? " " No , the school will . The seniors and juniors from Elk Park Prep are all supposed to go . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The headmaster 's office is going to call around and tell the parents . Perkins said the school would pick up the tab if you put out a little sign that says refreshments compliments of Elk Park Preparatory School . I suggested that part to him , " she said with a slight snort . " Audrey , you 're an advertising whiz . " She said bleakly , " I 'm a whiz , all right . " I did n't know whether the irritation I felt was from Audrey 's cynical tone or just my increasing impatience with her chronic unhappiness . " Okay , okay , " I said . " Tell Perkins I 'll do it and that I 'll call him . " At that moment , I would have preferred to be a pelt in a Marensky coat than face another metaphor . She said she 'd leave Perkins a message because she had another meeting to go to . Then she turned and traipsed off . I went in search of Miss Ferrell . She did not teach Arch , but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe she could give me some perspective on his problems . After about ten minutes of pointless wandering through mazelike halls , I located Miss Ferrell 's room . Actually , it was n't that difficult : It was the only door with a poster of a giant croissant on it . Above , a hand-lettered sign was posted : SENIORS : DISCUSS APPLICATION ESSAY AND ROLE-PLAY COLLEGE INTERVIEWS TODAY THIIRD PERIOD . From inside the room came the sound of voices . I opened the door and slipped in , heeded only by five or six of the thirty seniors within . Audrey appeared to have just come in also ; to my surprise , she was sitting in the back . The Marenskys , apparently finished with their powwow with the headmaster , plus the Dawsons and several other sets of- parents , were seated over to the  | side . A couple raised eyebrows at my entrance . I shrugged . Just me , the caterer . I noticed that a number of the seniors were mourning their valedictorian with black armbands . A short , round fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I shook my head , he reluctantly turned his attention back to the front of the room . Miss Ferrell 's toast-colored hair was swept up into a large topknot held on the crown of her head by a trailing red scarf that matched the red of her tent dress . The dress itself was one of those bifurcated triangles , half bright red , half raspberry pink . She looked like a pyramid of sherbet . I took the one empty chair at the back of the room . Julian gave me a high-five sign and I smiled . Guess I had shown up at the right time . " Okay now , " said Miss Ferrell , " it seems to me that too many of you are becoming obsessively worried about what colleges want ? " A hand shot up . " Yes , Ted ? " " I heard that for the most selective schools , if you are n't in the top ten percent of your class , you are dead . " There was a collective sharp intake of breath at Ted 's infelicitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a response . " Well , the ranking may have some effect , but it also helps to have good grades showing your effort . . . " " But what about a composite SAT score between 1550 and 1600 ? " prompted another student fiercely . " Do n't you have to have that too ? " " I heard you had to play varsity soccer , basketball , and la-crosse , " catcalled another , " and get the good sportsmanship award too . " There were whispers and shaken heads . Miss Ferrell gave her audience an unsmiling look that brought a hush . " Look , people ! I could tell you that the ideal applicant walks a minimum of six miles each way to school ! That lie 's a volunteer  | vigilante on the subway ! Is that going to make you feel better or worse about this process ? " " There 's no subway in the mountains ! Good or bad ? " Audrey Coopersmith decorously raised her hand . " I heard that the ideal applicant comes from a low-income single-parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her voice . " And I also heard that if the applicant 's after-school job helps support the family financially , it shows character , and that 's what top colleges are looking for . " Cries of " what ? " and " huh ! " brought another stern look fmm Miss Ferrell . Did Heather Coopersmith have an after-school job ? I could n't remember . " That is one possible profile . " Miss Ferrell drew her mouth into a rosebud of tiny wrinkles . Hank Dawson raised his hand . " I heard that the top applicants had to do volunteer work . I do n't think it 's safe for Greer to hang around some soup kitchen with a bunch of welfare types . " " Nobody has to do anything , " replied Miss Ferrell crisply . " We 're looking for a fit between a student and a school . . . . " Rhoda Marensky raised her hand . Her rings flashed . She 'd draped her fur over her lap . " Is it appropriate for the applicant to discuss minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Slavic surnames . " Hank Dawson bellowed : " What a crock ! " Greer Dawson cried , " Daddy ! " Caroline Dawson gave her husband and daughter a be-quiet look which made both droop obediently . Macguire Perkins swiveled his long neck and smirked at his classmates . " I flunk . I quit . Guess I 'll be at Elk Park forever . You can all come visit me here . There 's no way any school 's going to let me in . " " You 've already demonstrated how not to get in , " said Miss Ferrell quietly . There were snickers from the listeners , but I missed the joke . Miss Ferrell demanded of Macguire , " Did you  | write to Indiana ? I asked you to have it ready by today , remem-ber ? " " Yeah , yeah , " he said under his breath . " I would like you to share it with us , please . " " Oh , shit . " " Macguire , let 's go . " Macguire grumbled and slapped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up here , please , " commanded Miss Ferrell . " Now , everyone , quiet , please . As I 've said numerous times , honesty and creativity are what we value in these essays . Parents " ? she nodded meaningfully at the tense adults in the back of the room ? " would do well to remember that . " Macguire groaned again . Then he unfolded his long body from his desk and slouched to the front of the class , where he towered over the diminutive Miss Ferrell . The holes in his tight jeans showed muscled flesh . His oversize shirttails hung from beneath his sweatshirt . He gave a self-deprecating grin and blushed beneath his acne . It was painful . Miss Ferrell warned , " If there is any disturbance during Macguire 's presentation , the offender will be excused . " Macguire gave a beseeching look to the class . Then , reluctantly , he lifted several crumpled pages and started reading . " I want to go to Indiana University because their basketball team needs me . I have always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me yelling at the TV during the NCAA finals , " Hoosier mother ? Hoosier father ? " ' " Someone snickered . Macguire cleared his throat and contin-ued . " I 'm using my essay to apologize for the way I acted when I came for my campus visit . And also to set the record straight . " It started off because some of my basketball teammates from last year 's senior class are at I.U. , and they all pledged SA F. And also , I did n't get along with my campus host . I mean , in the  | real world we would n't have been friends , so why pretend ? I 'm just trying to explain how everything went so wrong , for which I m sincerely sorry . " After my campus host and I parted company  --  I did not ditch him , as he claimed  --  I went over to SAE to see the guys . They were having a keg party and invited me to join in . I did n't want to be rude and I did sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , this time I would be polite . ' " The laughter grew louder . Macguire looked up . To Miss Ferrell , he said in a low voice , " I know you just said one page for the essay , but this is a long story . I had to add extra sheets . " " Just read , " ordered Miss Ferrell . She gave the giggling mass of students a furious look . They fell silent . " So anyway , ' " Macguire resumed with a twitch of his lanky body , " there we were , and I was being polite and a good guest . Yes , I know I am underage , but as I said , I was trying to be polite . Now , after I was polite for all those hours , of course I could n't find my way back to the dorm , because you 've built all those buildings out of Indiana limestone , and to be perfectly honest , they all look alike . While I was lost I was real sorry I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the dorm , and I am truly sorry for the guy on the first floor whose window I had to knock on so he could let me in . He was mad at me , but it was n't that cold out , I mean I 'd just been lost out there for over an hour , and I was n't cold . So why should he have minded so much to come outside in his underwear ? And why would you lock up the dorms on a Friday night , anyway ? You must know people are going to stay out late partying . ' " I looked around . All the senior parents looked somewhat shellshocked . Macguire plunged on . " I do n't want to be , like , too graphic , but my college counselor is always telling us to write an honest essay . So to be perfectly honest , after I passed out for a couple of hours I woke up and had to puke . It was an overwhelm-  | ing urge brought on by all that time I was being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that I did n't ruin all that nice Indiana limestone outside my window but instead hauled ass down to the bathroom . " After I hurled I felt better . I wanted to go right back to sleep so I could be on time for my interview the next morning and tell you how I helped bring Elk Park Prep to the state finals in basketball with my three-point shots , and not have to listen to you ask me a bunch of questions about Soviet foreign policy . Okay , I told you in my letter that I did a paper on it my junior year , but who cares now ? I mean , the world has changed . " Anyway , at three A.M. I was in the bathroom ready to go back to bed . Here 's an honest question : Why do you put the exit to go back outside right next to the bathroom door ? So there I was again , outside , and not smelling too good this time , knocking again on that guy 's window to be let in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , now that I look back on it , he did n't have to get that ticked off . It was Friday night ! He did n't have classes the next day ! But as I told you . . . ' " Macguire looked hopefully at Miss Ferrell . " You see , I 'm not one of those guys who use bad grammar and say , Like I told you . That ought to count for something . " " Macguire ! Read ! " Macguire cleared his throat and found his place . " I am sorry , ' " he read . " I 'm sorry to the guy in the underwear , I 'm sorry for drinking when I was a minor , I 'm sorry that when you asked me about Soviet foreign policy I said , Who gives a shit ? and I 'm sorry to my campus host , ca n't remember his name . You can tell him that if he wants to come out to Colorado , I 'll show him a good time . Promise . ' " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parents sat in stunned silence . Macguire , flushed with pleasure , gave the class a broad smile . I began to clap too , until I saw Miss Ferrell 's frown . My hands froze in mid-clap . She rapped  | on her desk until she had quiet . " Can I go back to my desk ? " implored Macguire . " You may not . I will talk to you later about that . . . essay . Meanwhile , I want you and Greer Dawson to sit down and roleplay an interview . Greer will be the director of admissions at . . . hmm . . . Vassar . Macguire , you will be the applicant . " Macguire slumped unhappily into a chair while Greer Dawson walked primly to the front of the room . Today she was dressed like an L.L. Bean ad : impeccable white turtleneck , navy cardigan , Weejuns , and a tartan skirt . Being paired with Macguire Perkins obviously annoyed her . Miss Ferrell directed her to the desk at the front , then crossed her arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and exhaled deeply . It seemed to me that Macguire would be better off auditioning with Barnum and Bailey than trying to go to I.U. , but I was not in the college advisement business . Thank God . " Gee , " said Macguire in a deep voice . He tilted his head and eyed Greer lovingly . " I 'd really like to go to Vassar now that it 's coed . I want to watch the Knicks play in New York and I ca n't get into Columbia . " Laughter erupted from the gallery . " Miss Ferrell ! " protested Greer with a shake of her straight , perfectly cut blond hair . " He 's not taking this seriously ! " " I am too ! " said Macguire . " I really , really want to go to your school , Hammer , uh " ? he opened his eyes wide at Greer and she tsked ? " Miss Dawson . " Miss Ferrell gestured to Greer to continue . Greer 's sigh was worthy of any martyr . " I understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have a year-abroad program , as you know . Does that interest you ? " " Not that much , " drawled Macguire , his mouth sloped downward . " I really hate Spanish , and German is too hard . What interests me is your coed dorms . I did my senior thesis on sexual liberation . "  | " Macguire , please ! " cried Miss Ferrell over the squeals of amusement . " I told you not to talk about sex , religion , or poli-tics ! " " Oh , God , fuck , I 'm sorry , Miss Ferrell . . . well , I do n't care about politics anyway . " " Macguire ! " " Well , I do n't want to go to Vassar anyway , " he whined . " I ca n't get into Stanford or Duke . I just want to go to Indiana . " " Yes , and we 've all seen just how likely that 's going to be , " snapped Miss Ferrell . " Let 's get two more people up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Heather Coopersmith . What school interview do you want to role-play , Julian ? " Julian shuffled between the desks . He flopped into the chair formerly occupied by Macguire , ran his hand nervously through his mowed hair , and said , " Cornell , for food science . " " All right , " said Miss Ferrell . " Heather , " she said to Au-drey 's daughter , a dark-haired girl with her mother 's face , pinktinted glasses , and thin , pale lips , " let him ask the questions . " " This is not fair . " Greer Dawson was miffed . " I did n't really get a chance . " " That 's true , she did n't , " piped up her father . " You will , you will , " said Miss Ferrell dismissively . " This is a learning experience for everybody ? " " But the period 's almost over ! " Greer cried . Miss Ferrell opened her eyes wide . The sherbet-colored dress trembled . " Sit down , Greer . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Cornell ? " From the gallery came the cry , " Ask her about home ec ! Can I learn to be a smart caterer here ? " Julian flushed a painful shade . My heart turned over . Julian touched his tongue to his top lip . " I do n't want to do this now . " The exasperated Miss Ferrell surrendered . " All right , go hack to your desks , everybody . " During the ensuing chairscraping and body-squishing , she said , " people , do you think this  | is some kind of joke ? " She put her hands on her sherbet-clad hips . " I 'm trying to help you . " She panned the classroom . She looked like a Parisian model who had been told to do peeved . And the class was taking her about that seriously . To my great relief , the bell rang . Miss Ferrell called out , " Okay , drafts of personal essays before you leave , people ! " I fled to a corner to avoid the press of jostling teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrell was slapping papers around on her desk , looking thoroughly disgusted . " Quel dommage , " I said , approaching her . What a pity . " Oh ! I did n't see you here . " She riffled papers on top of her roll book . " It 's always like this until a few days before the deadlines . What can I help you with ? Did you come to see me ? There 's no French Club today . " " No , I was here to see the headmaster . Forgive me , I just wanted to drop in because , actually , Arch loves French Club . But he 's having trouble with his schoolwork ? " She looked up quickly . " Did you hear about this morning ? " She drew back , her tiny body framed by a rumpled poster of the Eiffel Tower on one side and a framed picture of the Arc de Triomphe on the other . When I shook my head , she walked with a tick-tock of little heels over to the door and closed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " I said . " Mr. Perkins told me about Arch . About his academic and . . . social problems . " Come to think of it , he 'd only mentioned the schoolwork mess . " Did he tell you about this morning ? " " No , " I said carefully , " just that Arch was flunking a class . " Just .. " This is worse than that . " " Worse ? " Miss Ferrell eyed me . She seemed to be trying to judge whether I could take whatever it was she had to say . I asked , " What happened to Arch this morning ? " " We had an assembly . The student body needed to know  | about Keith . " Her abrupt tone betrayed no feeling . " When it was over , I 'm sorry to say Arch had a rather strenuous disagreement with someone . " I closed my eyes . For being basically a kind and mature kid , Arch seemed to be getting into quite a few disagreements lately . I wondered what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you know ? We 've just had someone throw a rock through one of our windows , and maybe . . . " " Later Arch came and told me he 'd gotten into a fight with a seventh-grader , a boy who is frequently in trouble . The other boy apparently said Keith was a tattler . Puzzling . . . most seventhgraders do n't even know seniors . " " Is that all ? " " No . When Arch arrived at his locker , he found a nasty surprise . I went to check and . . . there was something there . . . . " " What ? " " You 'd better let me show you . I put my own lock on the locker , so it should be undisturbed . " She peeked out into the hallway . The students had settled into the new class period , so we were able to make it down to the row of seventh-grade lockers without being seen . Miss Ferrell minced along just in front of me . Her bright red scarf fluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clasp on Arch 's locker . " I told him to leave it alone and the janitor would clean it out . But I do n't know what to do about the paint . " What I saw first was the writing above Arch 's locker . Blo k letters in bright pink pronounced : HE WHO WANTS TO ; 1 TATTLER , NEXT TIME WILL FACE A LIVE . . . Miss Ferrell opened the locker door . Strung up and hanging on the hook was a dead rattlesnake.  | It was all I could do to keep from screaming . " What happened when Arch saw this ? " When Miss Ferrell did not answer immediately , I whacked the locker next to Arch 's . The snake 's two-foot-long body swayed sickeningly . It had been strung up just under its head , and hung on the hook where Arch 's jacket should have gone . I could n't bear to look at the expanse of white snake-belly , at the ugly , crimped mouth , at those rattles at the end of the tail . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby , he told me . " I kit dizzy . I leaned against the cold gray metal of the adjacent locker . More quietly , I said , " Was he okay ? Did he get up-set ? "  | She shook her head . I recognized generic teacherly sympathy . " Of course he was a bit shaken up . I told the head-master . " " Yes , right . " Tears burned at the back of my eyes . I was furious at the crack in my voice . Hold it in , hold it in , I warned myself . " What did Perkins do ? Why did n't he tell me about it this morning ? What happens now ? " Suzanne Ferrell drew her mouth into a slight moue . Her topknot with its bright scarf bobbed forward . " Alfred . . . Mr. Perkins said that it was probably just one of those seventh-grade pranks . That we should ignore it . " Beg to differ , I said silently as I whirled away from Miss Ferrell and headed back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I demanded of the receptionist . " On the phone . If you 'll just take a se ? " I stalked past her . " Excuse me , sir ! " I barked as heartily as any marine . " I need to talk to you . " Perkins was staring at the oil painting of Big Ben , droning into his receiver . " Yes , Nell , we 'll see you then . Okay , yes , great for everybody . We 'll be like . . . underground bookworms who have come up to feast on ? " At that moment he registered my presence . Just for a fraction of a second he raised the bushy white eyebrows at me , and I knew Nell had hung up . No worm feast for her . Perkins finished lamely , " . . . feast . . . on volumes . Ta-ta . " He replaced the receiver carefully , then laced his short fingers and studied me . There was a shadow of weariness in his pale eyes . " Yes ? Here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or about the muffins and whatnot before the SATs ? Or is it something else ? " " When you told me how my son was doing academically , you oddly neglected to mention that someone had left a threat , along with a dead rattlesnake , in his locker . And you say he 's  | having a little trouble socially ? You 're not only the master of metaphor , Perkins , you 're the emperor of euphemism . " His expression did n't change . He unthreaded his hands and opened his palms , a mannered gesture of helplessness . " If we had any idea ? " " Have you tried to find out ? Or are you sticking with the environment-of-trust idea ? " " Mrs. Korman , in seventh grade ? " " First of all , Mrs. Korman is not my name . Second , you 've just had a murder here , at your school , as a matter of fact in your home . Third , somebody threw a rock through our window the night of that murder . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a safe place ! " " Ah . " He adjusted his glasses and pursed his lips . Portrait of pensive . The wild white hair gleamed like a clown 's . " Goldy , is n't it ? I do believe we have a safe environment here . Whatever happened to unfortunate Keith was . . . out of the ordinary . " I swallowed . Headmaster Perkins drummed his fingers on the antique mahogany desk . " The kids , " he mused aloud , " engage in this . . . alternative behavior . . . all the time . I refer to the reptile , of course . If we become authoritarian , they 'll rebel with . . . more antisocial behavior , or with drugs . Look around you . " His delicate hands indicated his elegantly appointed office . " Do you we any graffiti here ? No one is rebelling . And that 's because we make this school an environment where our students do n't need to rebel . " " Thank you , Mr. Freud . Threats are worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids rebel in ways you do n't know . A murder , Mr. Headmaster . Rattlesnakes . Now , let 's get back to it being your job to at least try to find out who ? " The headmaster waved this away . " No , no , no . That simply is not possible , Mrs. K  --  Goldy . We do not have a regimen of conduct , and we do not go after offenders . We encourage responsibility . This . . . reptile incident should be viewed as a challenge  | for your son , a social challenge . It is young Arch 's responsibility to learn to cope with hostility . What I am trying to say to you , what I have to say to so many parents , is that we simply can not legislate morality . " Perkins gave me his patronizing grin . " And Mr. Freud is not my name , sorry to say . " Oh , cute . A social challenge . Ca n't legislate morality . I stood . At the door , I stopped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spend so much time and effort raising money for this school ? And worrying about its precious reputation ? " " Because money is the " ? he pondered for a moment , then spread his hands again ? " money is the . . . yeast that . . . leavens this institution 's ability to provide the best possible education . Our reputation is like our halo ? " " Is that right ? Well . You can have a huge doughball of responsibility , Mr. Headmaster , sir , but without morality it 's going to fall flat . Halos are elusive . Or , put another way , even a reptile knows when he 's in the dirt . Ta-ta . " At home I forced my mind off the school and set it onto the penitential luncheon four days away , the bookstore reception that same Friday evening , and the SAT spread for Saturday morning . Thank God I was going to Schulz 's for dinner . But not until I set some menus , ordered food , and had a heart-to-heart with Arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toasted sourdough spread with pesto , followed by Sole Florentine with fruit salad . The original recipe for Sorry Cake called for a rich batter developed to offer penance , my cookbook told me . The offender , a thirteenth-century French baker , had confessed to overcharging for bread . The local priest had ordered that the baker give away sweet cakes to all the villagers on Shrove ' hues day . Let the punishment ht the crime , I always say .  | For the bookstore affair , there were soft ripened cheeses ? Gorgonzola and Brie and Camembert  --  to order for the Volvo set and Chocolate-Dipped Biscotti to make for the young crowd . Better than trick-or-treat any day . Which reminded me . Since I had to be at the school for the SATs very early in the morning after the bookstore reading , I 'd have the pleasure of baking fresh corn , blueberry , and oat bran muffins at four A.M. Saturday . That ought to make me real sharp for dealing with lots of hungry , nervous seniors . Arch traipsed in and groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arch had fallen under Julian 's spell . In the clothes arena this had meant eschewing sweatsuits and working to coordinate school outfits , holding pants up to the light to see if the color matched a shirt , trying on leather bomber jackets and baggy pants in our local used-clothing store until he resembled Julian as closely as possible . But the three shirts that Arch had carefully layered in hues of blue and gray this morning now hung in uneven tails over his gray cotton pants . His face was unnaturally pale ; his eyes behind the glasses , bloodshot . I said , " I saw the snake . " He slung his heavy bookbag across the kitchen floor . The bookbag , another new accoutrement , had replaced his elementaryschool backpack . Not that the new books seemed to be getting a lot of use . Arch dropped heavily into one of the kitchen chairs . He ( lid not look at me , and he was fighting the tremble in his bottom lip . " Arch , do you have any idea who ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so worried ! And that painted message ! Tattle about what ? What do you know that you could possibly tattle . Tout ? " " Mom ! Quit babying me ! " This would get us nowhere . I asked , " Where 's Julian ?

Lay the slices on their cut sides and toast them at 375 ? for an additional 15 minutes or until lightly browned . Cool . Dip biscotti in chocolate the day they are to be served . In the top of a double boiler , melt the chocolate chips with the shortening , stirring frequently . Remove from the heat and stir until a candy thermometer reads 85 ? . Holding each cookie by its bottom , gently dip the tops into chocolate . Turn immediately and allow to dry , uncoated side down , on wax paper .

Just let me worry about my grades ! " " Are you worried about your grades ? Are the other kids doing this poorly ? " I changed my tone . Try soft , I ordered myself . " Do you think we need to go back into therapy together ? " " Great ! This is just great ! " My son 's thin face was pale and furious . " I come home after a horrible day and you 're just going to make it more horrible ! " " I am not ! " I hollered . " I want to help you ! " " Sure ! " he screamed before he banged out . " It really sounds like it ! " So much for adolescent psychiatry . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . I slapped bratwurst on a platter , cooked spinach and previously frozen homemade noodles for the boys ' evening meal , wrote them a note on how to heat it all up , and wondered vaguely about the suicide statistics for parents of teenagers . But self-preservation as a single mother meant not dwelling on such notions . If things got worse , I promised myself , we would take the therapy route again . Arch had not , after all , thrown his own rock or strung up his own snake . Being in a temper made me think I 'd better keep busy . I cut butter into flour and swirled in buttermilk , caraway seeds , raisins , and eggs to make a thick speckled batter for Irish Soda Bread . This I poured into a round pan and set to bake while I nipped of f to soak in a steaming bubble bath . Great-tasting bread and a great-smelling caterer . What else could Tom Schulz want ? Better not think about that , either .  | When the bread was done , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earmuffs . After a two-day respite , thick , smokecolored clouds had poured over the mountains . During the afternoon , the mercury had dropped fifteen degrees . The red sunrise was proving its warning . Flakes drifted down as I emerged from my front door . The icy wind made me hug the warm , fragrant round of Irish bread to my chest . I was thankful to see Julian chug tip our street . Without telling him where I was going , I begged him for the four-wheel-drive Range Rover . I could just imagine myself facing a sudden blizzard and then saying to Schulz , " Oops , guess I 'll have to spend the night . " Right . Turning the Rover around sounded and felt like an advanced tank maneuver . But once I had managed it , I headed toward Main Street through the thickening snow and began to reflect on my relationship with the homicide investigator . Being with Schulz was like . . .

During the emotional stages of my divorce , numbness had been followed by hatred and then resentment . During that time I 'd had neither the energy nor the desire for relationships . I had forsworn marriage , for ever and ever and ever . And since I was a good and faithful Sunday school teacher , swearing off marriage did n't leave many options in the fulfilling physical relationship department . Which was okay with me . I thought . A strange thing happened , though , after the cocoon of animosity had worn off and John Richard had become merely an annoyance to deal with on a weekly basis . Not so strange , Marla had insisted at our frequent meetings where we , his two ex-wives , discussed addiction to unhealthy relationships . Anyway , I began to have unexpected waves of Sexual Something . I 'd met Schulz , but kept my distance . I 'd had a short-lived , nonphysical ( but disastrous nonetheless ) crush on a local psychologist . Then when Arch gave up his swimming lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soda Bread 21/2 cups all-purpose flour ' /z cup sugar 1 ' /2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt ' /2 teaspoon baking soda ' /2 cup ( 1 stick ) unsalted butter 1 cup raisins 1 tablespoon caraway seeds 1 large egg 11/4 cups buttermilk ' /4 cup sour cream Preheat the oven to 350 ? .

Beat the egg , buttermilk , and sour cream together until blended . Stir the egg mixture into the dry mixture just until blended . Transfer the batter to the pan and bake for about 50 to 55 minutes , until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean . Makes 1 round loaf .  | to realize how much I would miss his coach 's easy smile . And there had been Arch 's art teacher at the elementary school , whom I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trim backside as he walked slowly from student to student , correcting their drawings . Shame ! Marla had teased me . Of course , she suffered from no such compunctions . Marla insisted that after the Jerk , she was not only giving up on marriage forever , she was going to have a great time doing so . And she had , while I felt guilty thinking about the swimming coach and the art teacher . And then I met Schulz . Schulz , who had a commanding presence and green eyes the color of seawater . As the fat flakes of snow swirled , I eased the Rover into fourth and remembered a time during the summer when I had driven out of town alone to Tom Schulz 's cabin . " Cabin " was much too diminutive a word for Schulz 's stunning two-story home built of perfectly notched logs . He had bought it at an IRS auction after a locally famous sculptor had been caught for back taxes . Now , while the sculptor was carving license plates in a federal penitentiary , Schulz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retreat to his remote haven with its rocks and aspens and pines , its panoramic view of the Continental Divide . On that night four months before , Schulz had fixed me an absolutely spectacular dinner that had helped get my mind off the arises of the moment , which included that ill-fated trademarkinfringement lawsuit instigated by Three Bears Catering in Denver . Having the last name Bear had never been more trying . The same evening , our conversation had turned serious when Schulz had told me about his one and only fiancee . Twenty years earlier , she had served as a nurse in Vietnam . She 'd been killed during an Artillery shelling . Arch made an unexpected appearance after hulz revealed this aspect of his past , and personal conversation had ended abruptly when our dinner for two became a cookout for three . It was not long after this that the homicide investigator had  | asked me if I 'd like to get rid of a whole bunch of problems by changing my last name to Schulz . He 'd taken my negative answer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schulz , the memory of the emotional black hole within my marriage to John Richard still remained . Many of my single women friends complained of loneliness , now that they were divorced . But my worst experience of loneliness , of lovelessness , of complete abandonment , had come when I was married . For that I blamed the institution , and not the man . Intellectually , I knew this was wrong . Still , emotionally , I never wanted to get into another situation where it was even possible to feel that low . I put the Range Rover back into third and chugged my way through deep slush on the dirt road . I thought back , involuntarily , to John Richard and his showers of blows , to the punch to my ear that had sent me reeling across the kitchen , to the way I screamed and beat my hands against the floor . I started to tremble . Pulling the Rover to the side of the road , I rolled down the window . Take it easy , girl . The snow made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , feeling the chilled air and the occasional icy flake on my face , chased away the ugly memories . I looked out at the whitened landscape , breathing deeply . And then my eye caught something on the road , half covered with snow . It was a dead deer . I turned away immediately . It was an unbearable sight , and yet something you saw all the time here , deer and elk smashed by cars going too fast to swerve away , Sometimes the cracked and bloodied carcasses lay by the side o the road for days , their open , huge brown eyes causing pain to any who cared to be caught in that sightless gaze . Oh , God , why had I been the one to find Keith Andrews Had he , too , had that experience of thinking he was loved an admired ? The black hole of hatred had come over him so sud denly , so prematurely , and now his parents were en route bar from Europe to bury him . . . . Involuntarily , I thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard . It was an organ torn in half , a rent , ripped , and useless thing . My heart would never be healed , I had become convinced ; it would just lie forever like an animal by the side of the road , smashed and dead . Oh , get a grip ! I revved the engine and recklessly gunned the Rover off the shoulder and onto the road . An evening with Schulz did n't need to cause such emotive eruption . You 're just going there or dinner , Goldy . You can handle it .  | When I pulled into his dirt driveway , Schulz was kneeling on the ground . Despite the weblike layer of new snow , he was spading soil energetically by the irregular flagstone walk that led to his front door . " Hi there . " I climbed carefully out of the Rover with the loaf of Irish bread . The image of the fallen deer still haunted mc : 1 did n't trust myself to say anything else . He turned and stood . Clods of wet soil clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm sorry , please finish what you 're ( king . 1 just ? " alp voice wobbled . Damn . The words were tumbling out ; I was shak ing my head , appalled at how shaken I was . " I just saw a deal  | animal by the side of the road and it reminded me . . . no , no , please , " I said as he started to move toward me . " Please finish what you were doing . " He regarded me with one eye crinkled in appraisal . After a moment he crouched down again . " It never will leave you , " he said without looking at me . " Seeing a real dead body is nothing like the movies . " His large , capable fingers reached for a handful of bulbs and carefully pressed them at intervals into the newly spaded trough . Gently he refilled the area with potting soil from a hag . The gesture reminded me of putting a blanket around a sleeping child . I breathed lungfuls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wore a down coat , it felt as if my blood had stopped circulating . " Cold ? " Schulz asked . " Need to go in ? " I shook my head . " I 'm sorry you were the one who had to find him , " he said gruffly . He finished patting down the soil , rose easily , and put an arm around my shoulders . " Come on , I made you some nachos . Then I need you to look at something . " We came through his sculpted-wood door and entered the large open space that was his living room . I stopped to admire the moss-rock fireplace that reached up two stories between roughhewn mortared logs . A carefully set pile of aspen and pine logs lay in the grate . On one Shaker-style table was a pot Arch had made at the end of sixth grade . On a wall was an Arch-made woodcut print of a .45 , the kind Schulz carried . A pickled-oak hutch held a display of Staffordshire plates and Bavarian glass . The sparse grouping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairs upholstered in nubby brown wool gave the place a homey feel . When I had complimented Schulz on his good taste during my last visit , he had replied without missing a beat : " Of course . Why d' you think I 'm courting you ? " I moved away from that thought and arrived in the kitchen dust as he was pulling an an gratin casserole out of the oven . The platter was heaped with sizzling corn chips , refried beans , and  | Machos Schulz 1 15-ounce can chili beans in chili gravy 9 tablespoons picante sauce 1 15-ounce bag corn tortilla chips 4 cups grated cheddar cheese 1 avocado 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 11/2 cups sour cream 1 tablespoon grated onion 4 scallions , both white and green parts , chopped 1 cup pitted black olives , chopped 1 tomato , chopped Preheat the oven to 400 ? .

Bake for about 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the beans are bubbling .  | Meanwhile , peel , pit , and mash the avocado , then mix it with the lemon juice , ' h cup of the sour cream , the grated onion , and 1 tablespoon picante sauce . Garnish the nachos with the guacamole , the remaining 1 cup sour cream , scallions , tomato , and olives . Makes 6 to 8 serv-ings.  | melted cheddar . A complicated smell of Mexican spices filled the air . " Agony , " I said when he had placed the platter in front of me and relieved me of the Irish bread . But I smiled . " Wait , wait . " He rummaged around in the refrigerator , then brought out tiny bowls and sprinkled chopped scallions , tomatoes , and black olives on top of the melted cheese . With a directorial flourish , he brandished  --  yes ! ? an ice cream scoop that he used to ladle perfect mounds of sour cream and guacamole on top of the platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a proud grin . " For this , we use the special china . " He brought out a beautiful pair of translucent Limoges plates painted with tiny , stylized roses . " These must have set you back a bit , " I said with admiration . " You do n't expect to find a china collector in the Sheriff 's Depart-ment . " " What do I have to spend money on ? Besides , the Sheriff 's Department is an equal-opportunity employer . You can have any hobby that helps get your mind off your job . " " Beans , cheese , tomatoes , and avocado are all aphrodisiac foods . " " Is that right ? Well , Goldy , we both know you 're impervious to all that . " We laughed . It was good to be with him ; I felt my anxiety recede . Digging into the Mexican mountain , Schuli retrieved a loaded chip stringy with hot cheese . " Open up , ma am . I held a plate under my chin and let him pop the nacho into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made appropriate moans of pleasure . " Speaking of aphrodisiacs , " he said when we were halfway through the platter , " I need to ask you something about a hook . Belonged to Keith Andrews . " " Oh , that reminds me . . . " I handed him the rock that had broken our upstairs window , then the Neiman-Marcus credit card . I had put the rock in a plastic hag ; Schulz eyed it , turned it  | over in his big hands , then laid it carefully aside . Between bites he studied the credit card , ran his fingers over the letters and numbers , then pocketed it without indicating what he was thinking . He put a last chip into his mouth and slid off his barstool all in one motion . When I hesitated , he gestured for me to fol-low . Like many of the more rustic homes in the mountains , Schulz 's did not have a garage . I put on my coat and followed him outside to his car , where he opened the trunk and carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look but do n't touch , " he warned . Not knowing what this was about or why I was doing it , I peered in and saw a jumble of papers , pens , and half-eaten pencils ; Stanford , Columbia , and Princeton catalogues and pamphlets ; a few books  --  a German-English dictionary , Faust , as well as the Cliff 's Notes for same ; Professor Romeo and Aceing the ACT ; several old copies of the Mountain Journal , and some frayed articles held together with staples . " What 's all this ? " " Stuff from the trunk of Keith Andrews ' car . You probably did n't notice his old Scirocco over in the corner of the parking lot at the school . I 've got custody of this stuff until tomorrow . His locker had more textbooks and some papers , but given that he was a supposed computer whiz , it 's odd we ca n't find any disks . The department 's checking the locker contents out . No credit cards or bills , though , we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the trunk lid and looked up at the dark clouds . After a moment he shook his head . " I do n't understand that school . I talk and talk to people and nothing comes up . The kid was smart , but not well liked . He worked hard on extracurricular activities , but nobody admired him for it . He brought back postcards from Paris for the whole French Club , and according to Arch , nobody thanked him . His windshield got broken , but by whom ? Somebody hated him enough to kill him by hashing in his  | head . It does n't sound like the supportive school community the headmaster is trying to convince me it is . " " His windshield got broken ? When ? What do you mean , according to Arch ? " " I talked to Arch this morning . He called me about some snake in his locker . " I shook my head . Unbelievable . Why not just label myself obsolete ? " Anyway , " Schulz was saying , " Arch told me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , that Julian and Keith Andrews had had some kind of argument a few weeks ago . I guess things got kind of out of hand . Keith 's windshield ended up getting shattered , but not at the time of the argument . " " When , then ? " Why did n't Julian ever tell me things like this ? " Before one of the bigwig college reps showed up at the school , is what I was told . " He paused . " Do you think Julian 's ashamed of being raised without money , his parents down in Utah , him having to work for and live with you his senior year , anything like that ? Something Keith Andrews could have made fun of ? " " Not that I know of , " I said firmly . Julian 's financial situation caused him pain , but he had never mentioned students ' ridiculing him for it . " I do think they had a girlfriend dispute , " I said lamely . " Remember , Julian told us about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the Mountain Journal offices . Arch was in the Rover , did n't hear the whole thing , said that it had something to do with schools . Seems Julian was worried that Keith was going to wri something negative about Elk Park Prep , when everyone w uptight enough already about the college application process . A they can say over at the paper was that Keith was doing sot kind of expose . They were going to read it before they decide whether or not to print it . "  | " Expose about what ? " " About Elk Park Prep , I think . " He gestured at the stuff in the trunk . " About test scores . About using Cliff 's Notes . About a professor who thinks he 's a Romeo . About taxes , for God 's sake . " Before I could ask him what he meant by that , he picked up a typed letter that had been done on perforated computer-printer ! riper . The letter looked like a draft . Words had been crossed out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd be more than happy to pay you your two hundred dollars if you 'd call the director of admissions at Columbia for me . Or maybe you 'd prefer I call the IRS ? IRS had a line through it , and Internal Revenue Service had been neatly written above it . " I do n't get it . " Schulz shrugged . " Stan Marensky had Keith do some yardwork for him . Marensky gave Keith a check for six hundred dollars for a four-hundred-dollar job with the agreement that Keith would refund him two hundred in cash . That way , Marensky could claim a six-hundred-dollar expense on his taxes . Petty thievery , not all that uncommon , and Marensky owned up to it pretty quick . " " So much for Saint Andrews . This is a pretty dark side . Maybe it explains why he was n't universally liked . I mean , an expose ? Blackmailing a powerful parent ? " Schulz 's hand grasped the trunk lid , making it creak . " Well , Marensky thought the blackmail was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , and did n't have any influence there . Ile says . Claims he never got his two hundred dollars back . I sulked the headmaster about Marensky , and he said he was like a , a , now , let 's see , what did he say . . . " I punched Schulz lightly on the shoulder . " Do n't . " Looking down at the jumble of papers in the trunk , I shivered . " I ca n't look at this stuff anymore . Let 's go have some of your shrimp enchiladas . " " You peeked. "  | " Hey ! This is a caterer you 're talking to ! Every meal someone else slaves over is a spy mission . " " Just tell me if you know whether Julian and Keith had any real animosity . Before I question Julian again myself . You think he 'd break somebody 's windshield ? " " He 's got some hostility , but I doubt he 'd do that . " " Do you know whether any of the teaching staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! I do n't ! Gosh , what is the matter with that school ? I wish I could find out what 's going on . " " Well , you 're doing those dinners for them . You hear stuff . I want to know about anything that sounds strange , out of place . " " Look , this murder happened at a dinner I was catering ! It 's my window that was broken and my son 's locker that was vandalized ! For crying out loud , Tom , the Andrews boy even looked like Arch . You think I want my kid in a school with a murderer on the loose ? I have a stake in finding out what 's going on out there . Believe me , I 'll keep you informed . " He tilted his head and regarded me beneath the tentlike brows . " Just do n't go off half cocked , Miss G. " " Oh , jeez , give me a break , will you ? What do you think I am , some kind of petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the house . " Who , you ? The light of my life ? The fearless breaker-andenterer ? You ? Never ! " " You are so awful . " I traipsed after him , unsure how I felt t be called the light of anyone 's life . Schulz settled me at his cherrywood dining room table , and then began to ferry out dishes . He had outdone himself . Pltiinp , succulent shrimp nestled inside blue corn tortillas smothered with a green chile and cream cheese sauce . Next to these he served bacon-sprinkled refried black beans , a perfectly puffed Mexican corn pudding , and my fragrant Irish bread . A basket of raw vege tables and pot of picante treacle with fresh papaya graced the table between the candles . 1 savored it all . When was the last time I 'd  | enjoyed an entire dinner that I had not exhausted myself preparing ? I could n't remember . " Save room for chocolate , " Schulz warned when the room had grown dark except for the candlelight flickering across his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was curled up on his couch . Schulz lit the enormous pile of logs . Soon the snap and roar of burning wood filled the air . Schulz retreated to the kitchen and returned with cups of espresso and a miniature chocolate cake . I groaned . " It 's a good thing I 'm not prone to jealousy . I 'd say you were a better cook than I am . " " Not much chance of that . " He had turned on his outside light and was peering into the night . " Darn . It 's stopped snow-ing . " So we had had the same thought . Once again I veered away from this emotional territory , the way you leap onto a makeshift sidewalk when the sign says HARD HATS ONLY ! Schulz wordlessly cut the cake and handed me a generous slice of what was actually two thin layers of fudge cake separated by a fat wedge of raspberry sherbet . Unlike my ex-husband , who had always had a vague notion that I liked licorice ( I detest it ) , Schulz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cake was exquisite . When it was reduced to crumbs , I licked my fingers , sighed , and asked , " Does Keith Andrews ' family have money ? " He shrugged and leaned over to turn off the light . " Yes and nu . " He picked up my hand and ran his fingers over it lightly . The same gesture he had used with the credit card , I remembered . " Thought any more about my name-change offer ? " " Yes and no . " He let out an exasperated chuckle . " Wrong answer . " The firelight flickered over his sturdy body , over his hopeful , inviting face , and into eyes ( lark with a caring I was n't quite willing to face .  | " Goldy , " he said . He smiled . " I care . Believe it ? " " Yeah . Sure . But . . . are n't you . . . do n't you . . think about all that 's happened ? You know , your nurse ? " " Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . " He took both of my hands in his , lifted them , and kissed them . " I do not live in the past . " My protest sounded weak . " And I have the psychotherapy bills to prove it . " He leaned in to kiss me . He caught about half of my mouth , which made us both laugh . The only sounds in the room were fire crackle and slow breaths . For a change , I was at a loss for words . Without unlocking his eyes from mine , Schulz slipped one hand to the small of my back and inscribed gentle circles there . How I wanted to be loved again . I said , " Oh , I do n't know . . . " " You do care about me , do n't you ? " " Yes . " And I did , too . I loved having this beautiful meal , this hissing fire , this lovely man whose touch now made me shiver after all the years of self-righteous celibacy . The wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dripped , and spiraled . I took Schulz 's hands . They were rough , big hands , hands that every day , in ways I could only imagine , probed questions about life and death and feeling morally grounded in your actions . I smiled , lifted my hands to his face , and corrected the angle of his head so that when I brought his lips to mine , this time they would tit exactly . We made love on his couch , our clothes mostly on , in a great shuddering hurry . Then , tenderly , he put his hands around my waist and said we should go upstairs . On the staircase , with my loosened clothes more or less falling around me , one of his hands caught me by the hip and pressed me into the wall . And this time he did not miss when his warm mouth found mine . His log-paneled bedroom with its high-pitched ceiling had the inviting scent of aftershave and pinewood . Schulz handed me  | a thick , soft terry-cloth robe . He lit a kerosene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and the bed , leaving the far reaches of the room deep in shadow . Beneath my bare feet the wood floor felt creamy-cold . I slipped between cool cotton sheets , keeping the robe on . He bent toward me . " You all right ? " " I am very all right . " Schulz 's body depressed the mattress next to me when he slid between the sheets and I involuntarily slid toward him . The sensation was odd after five years of sleeping alone . He pulled the down comforter around my shoulders and whispered , " I love you now and forever and ever . " I could n't help it . Tears slid out of my eyes . My breath raked across the back of my throat . He hugged me tightly and I mumbled into his warm shoulder , " Thank you . Thank you , " as his fingers tenderly worked their way under the robe . This time the caresses were slow and lingering , so that the great heaving release took us by surprise . Just as I was drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind 's eye , take my ripped carcass of a heart and gently , gently begin sewing . I woke up with a start sometime in the middle of the night . I thought : I have to get home , God , this is incredible . Schulz and I had rolled apart . I turned to look at his face and the shape of his body the moonlight streaming through the uncurtained window . His cheeks were slack , like a child 's ; his mouth was slightly open . I kissed his eyelids . They were like the velvety skin of new peaches . His eyes opened . He propped himself up on an elbow . " You okay ? Need to go ? Need some help ? " " Yes , I need to go , but no thanks , I do n't need help . " And I was fine . For a change . I dressed quickly , gave Schulz a long , wordless hug , and hightailed it toward home in the Rover . It was just past midnight .  | The snow had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and bright in the sky , a pure white crescent . The clean , cold air gushing through the car windows was incomparably sweet . I felt wonderful , light-headed , lighthearted , giddy . I steered the Rover with one hand and laughed . An enormous weight had lifted from me ; I was floating . Unfortunately , my hope of sneaking quietly to bed was not to be realized . When I pulled up curbside , it was my house , and mine alone on the snow-covered street , that shone like a beacon . Lights blazed from every window . " Where have you been ? " Julian accused when I came through the security system . The house reeked of cigarette smoke . Julian had beer on his breath . He looked horrid . His face was gray , his eyes bloodshot . His unwashed mohawk haircut stood up in tiny tepees . " Do n't tell me you had more trouble with someone throw-ing ? " I began , stunned out of my idyll . When he shook his head , I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here ? You do n't smoke . You 're a swimmer , for God 's sake ! And what 's with the beer breath , Mr. Underage ? " " I have been so worried ! " Julian hollered as he slammed into the kitchen ahead of me . So much for my great mood . What in heaven 's name was going on ? How had Julian gotten himself into such a state ? I came home late all the time , although now I recalled belatedly that Julian and Arch usually checked the calendar to see wlwre my catering assignment was on any given evening . Maybe Julian just was n't used to not knowing where I was . On the other hand , maybe he was worried about something else . Stay calm , I resolved . I followed him into the kitchen . " Where is Arch ? " I said in low voice . " In bed , " Julian tossed over his shoulder , and opened m walk-in refrigerator . Next to the sink were three glass beer  | ties , empty , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in jail for allowing him to drink in my home . Chinese stars were scattered over the financial aid books stacked on the gingham tablecloth . Chinese stars are sharp-edged metal stars about the size of an adult 's palm , which is where you can hide them , I had once been told . I had learned about the weapons unexpectedly , when a boy at Arch 's elementary school had been caught with them . The principal had sent the students home with a mimeographed note about the weapons . Used in Tae Kwon Do , Chinese stars were banned at the school because when thrown , the letter explained , they could inflict great damage . The fellow who had brought them to Furman Elementary School had been summarily suspended . Looking straight at Julian , I scooped them all up and placed them in a pile on the counter . " What is going on ? " Julian emerged from the refrigerator . He held a platter of cookies . In times of stress , eat sweets . He said , " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he popped two cookies into his mouth and chewed voraciously . " Really . If you have cookies on top of beer , you 'll throw up . " He slammed the platter down . " Do n't you even care ? Do you realize he 's not safe at that school ? " " Well , excuse me , Mr. Mom . Yes , I realize it . Mr. Perkins seems to think it 's a joke , however . A seventh-grade joke . " I took a cookie . " Arch called Schulz , though , and told him all about the snake . " Julian slapped his compact body down on a chair ; he ran a hand through the sparse crop of hair . " Do you think we could hire a bodyguard for Arch ? How much would that cost ? " I swallowed . " Julian . You are very protective and sweet . However . You are overreacting . A bodyguard is not the answer to Arch 's problems . " " You do n't know these people ! They 're vicious ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Keith ! "  | " What people ? " He squeezed his eyes shut . " You just do n't get it . You 're just . . . indifferent . The Elk Park Prep people , that 's what people . Perkins is always talking about trust and responsibility . Two coats , a cassette , and forty dollars were stolen out of my locker last year . Trust ? It 's a crock . " " Okay . Look . Julian , please . I 'm not indifferent . I agree with you that there 's a problem . I just do n't know what to do . But I can tell you a bodyguard is out of the question . " His eyes opened ; he scowled . " I went to the newspaper because I know there 's a snake lady in Aspen Meadow . You know , she comes into the schools and does demonstrations with live snakes . Maybe we can find out who got the rattler by contacting her , I know she sells them ? " " Julian ! For heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake here ? He 's not safe ! None of us is safe ! " With a second cookie halfway to my mouth , I gaped at him . " Could n't you please cool off ? The way to react to this is not to smoke , drink , pull out your weapons , and put the screws on the snake lady , okay ? " I put the cookie back on the platter and tool : a deep breath . " Wo n't you please go up and get some sleep ? You 're going to need your energy , with that midterm tomorrow and the college boards right around the corner . I need to go to bed too , " I added as an afterthought . " Do you promise me you 'll follow through with Schulz ? " " I 'm way ahead of you , Julian . " He thought about that for a minute , then shot an accusing look at me . " You never told me where you were . " " Not that I need to answer to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glanced at the ceramic clock that hangs over my sink . One o'clock . " Kinda late for dinner , would n't you say ? " " Julian , go to bed . "  | My phone rang at seven o'clock . I groped for it . " Goldilocks ' Catering , Where Everything ? " " Ah , Goldy the caterer ? " said Father Olson . " Oh , Lord ! " I gargled into the mouthpiece . " Who told you ? ? " Er ? " " I mean , how could you have found out ? It was just last night ! " " What ? " I pressed my face into my pillow and knew better than to speak . An awkward silence ensued while I involuntarily recalled the Sunday school teaching on sexual activity between single adults ? " . . . either single and celibate or married and faithful . "  | Oh well . The silence lengthened . Father Olson cleared his throat . I sat up gingerly , wondering if priests were frequently greeted with early morning guilt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father Olson resumed a normal tone . " I 'm sorry to call so early , Goldy . Ahh . . . but I have an all-day clergy meeting in Denver , and I wanted to give you the final count on Friday 's luncheon board meeting . There 'll be twelve of us . " I swallowed hard . " Twelve . How biblical . " " Can you tell me the menu ? Because of our theological dis-cussion . " Fish , " I said succinctly . When I did n't elaborate , he mumbled something that was not a blessing , and disconnected . The phone immediately rang again . I flopped back down on the mattress . Why me ? " Come to Aspen Meadow , " intoned Marla 's husky voice , " the promiscuity capital of the western United States . " I rolled over and peered blearily at the early morning grayness . Clouds shrouded the distant mountains like a woolen blan-ket . " I do n't know why George Orwell bothered to write 198.1 . He obviously never had to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . " " So you 're not going to deny it ? " Marla demanded . " I 'm not saying anything . Tell me why you 're calling so early . " " In case you 're wondering how I suspected that something was up , so to speak , my dear , I called your fellow I like so mu ( that teen housemate-helper ? " " His name is Julian . " " Yes , well , I called you numerous times last night and gut young Julian , who , as I say , is somewhat more forthright than his employer . He said your calendar did n't show any catering assign-ments . " She stopped to take a noisy bite of something . " When he still knew nothing at eleven , but was obviously quite besiege  | with worry , I thought , This is our early-to-bed , early-to-work much-beloved town caterer ? " She took time out to chew , then added , " Besides , if you 'd been in an accident , I would have heard before now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of cooking ahead , and so ? " " Tut-tut , not so fast , tell me what 's going on in your love life . I do n't want to hear about it from anyone else . " Well , you 're not going to hear about it from me , either . I laughed lightly and replied , " Everything you suspect is true . And flare . " From the wounded warrior , Miss Cut and Chaste ? I do n't think so . " " Look . I had dinner with Schulz . Let me reflect a little bit before I have to analyze the relationship to death , okay ? " That seemed to satisfy her . " All right . Go cook . But when you take a break , I have some real news for you concerning the Elk Park preppies . Unless you want it now , of course . " This was so typical of her . " Make it fast and simple , " I said . " I have n't had any caffeine yet . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you could be trying to figure out what 's going ' on out at Colorado 's premier prep school . All right  --  that German pseudo-academic guy out there ? The one who wrote the Faust dissertation ? " " Egon Schlichtmaier . What about him ? " " He helped you with that dinner , right ? " " He did . I do n't know much about him . " " Well , I do , because he 's single and has therefore been the subject of the usual background investigation from the women in step aerobics . " I shook my head . How women at the Aspen Meadow Athletic Club could manage to step up , down , and sideways at dizzying speeds while trading voluminous amounts of news and gossip was one of the wonders of ' modern physiology . Yet it was done , regularly and enthusiastically .  | I ordered , " Go ahead . " " Egon Schlichtmaier is twenty-seven years old , " Marla rattled on , " but he and his family immigrated to this country when there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems learning English , Herr Schlichtmaier got a good education , including a Ph.D . in literature from dear old C.U . in Boulder . But poor Egon was unable to get a college teaching job . " " So what else is new ? I heard the ratio of humanities doctor-ates to available jobs is about ten to one . " " Let me finish . Egon Schlichtmaier is also extremely goodlooking . He works out with weights and has a body to die for . " I conjured up a mental picture of the history teacher . He was short , which meant I could look right into his olive-toned baby face with its big brown eyes . He had curly black hair and long black eyelashes , and whenever I had seen him he had been wearing khaki pants , an oxford-cloth shirt in some pastel shade , and a fashionable jacket . Ganymede meets Ralph Lauren . " What else ? " The lack of coffee was beginning to get to me . Besides , and I was astonished that I even had this thought , Schulz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's the scoop . . . he was a teaching assistant at C.U. , and he was caught having affairs with no less than three female undergraduates . At the same time . Which is his business , I guess , except that the word got around at the Modern Language Association convention . The universities , when they got wind of it , would n't offer him a job scrubbing floors . Seems they thought the last thing they needed was a prof who would cause trouble among tuition-paying undergraduates . " Since I was no longer what we would call pristine in the lust department , I avoided judgment . But three at a time ? Consecutively or simultaneously ? I said , " Did all the academics from coast to coast know these details ? " " The way I heard it , only the hiring schools knew . " She chewed some more of whatever it was . " ' The headmaster at EIk Park Prep owed the head of the C.V . comparative literature de*  | partment a favor from some kid the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egon Schlichtmaier as a kind of interim thing to teach U.S. history . Mind you , this was after he had fired another American history teacher , a Miss Pamela Samuelson , over some unknown scandal last year . This year Egon was supposed to keep looking for a college teaching job . " " Miss Samuelson ? Miss Pamela Samuelson ? Why is that mime familiar ? " " Pamela Samuelson was in your aerobics class before you quit the club , dummy . " " Oh , yes , " I said , still unable to conjure up a face . " What about Egon Schlichtmaier 's history with the female undergraduates ? How could Perkins justify having that kind of guy around ? " Marla sighed gustily . " Come on , Goldy . First of all , as you and I both know , if nobody squeals about how awful a guy is , then his reputation remains intact . " " So the undergraduates were n't talking . And the news did n't outlive the MLA convention ? " " Apparently not . And if anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking for was that this was youthful excess that people would soon forget if the issue were left alone . The word is , Perkins warned Egon not to get involved with the preppie females , or he 'd be teaching French to the longhorn steers down at the stock show . And there 's no evidence Egon went after anyone who was n't close to his own age . More on that later . Here 's the problem . How willing do you think a college would be to hire Schlichtmaier if his background were exposed in a series of articles for the Mountain Journal by an ambitious student-reporter aiming to spice up his application to the Columbia School of journalism ? " " No , no , not Keith Andrews . . . " " The same . And guess who was trying to get Keith not to publish the articles ? Your dear Julian ! " " ( ) h , God . Are you sure ? " " So I hear . And guess who was sleeping with Schlichtniaier  | until she supposedly heard the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith Andrews ? " " I ca n't imagine , but I know you 're going to tell me . " " Mademoiselle Suzanne Ferrell . I do n't know whether they have broken up irreparably , but I 'm supposed to find out at the nine o'clock step class . " " Tell me about this unknown scandal with Miss . . . who was Schlichtmaier 's predecessor ? " " Pamela Samuelson , I told you . " " Could you check on it ? I 'd like to get together with her . " " She 's moved to another aerobics class , so it 'll be tough . " " Okay , let me tell Schulz all this . " Marla giggled suggestively . " Really , I just told this story so you 'd have an excuse to call him this morning . " She rang off with the promise that she would do all this snooping if I paid her in cookies . I promised her ChocolateDipped Biscotti , and she swooned . I did my yoga , then reflected on the communications network in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a mountain resort to a place where people lived year-round , the first social institution had been the fire department . In a climate so dry a fire could consume acres of forest in less than a blink , the need for mutual protection had drawn even rugged loners into social contact . With the weather and roads unpredictable in winter , now it was the telephone that people used to tell everything : about everybody . That is , if you did n't have the benefit of step aerobic ' , But sometimes I would hear so much news about somebody that .. the next time I saw the person in question , he would look as he 'd aged . Egon Schlichtmaier could easily sprout gray hairs the next week , and I would never notice . By the time I got downstairs , the sky had turned the color  | charcoal and was beginning to spit flakes of snow onto the pine trees around my house . But the enveloping grayness brought no ( lark mood . In fact , I realized suddenly , I felt fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coziness . I did n't want to admit  --  to Marla , Schulz , Arch , even to myself  --  what this new state was , but it felt a lot like falling in you-know-what . Seeing Arch and Julian in the kitchen , however , gave me a jolt of alarm . Julian 's skin was as ashen as the sky outside , and the pouches under his eyes were deep smudges . When we lived and worked at a client 's house over the summer , he went to bed early , was up at six to swim his laps , shower , and dress carefully before setting off for Elk Park Prep . I could n't remember when he 'd taken the time to swim in the week since Keith 's murder . This morning he looked as if he had had no sleep at all , and he was wearing the same rumpled clothes from the night before . I was beginning to wonder if living with us was the best thing for him . But I did n't want to get him upset by asking more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in three layers of green shirts complemented by dark green jeans , a cheery smile . Arch smiled hack gleefully . " Julian 's heating his special chocolate croissants ! " he announced . " He says we do n't have time for anything else ! " To my look of dismay , Arch added , " Come on , Mom . Have one with your espresso . While a chocolate croissant would hardly be Headmaster Perkins ' idea of a nutritious breakfast , I quickly surrendered . Julian was not just a good cook , he was an artist . He had the touch with food and the love of culinary creation that are truly rare , and he 'd had early and excellent experience as an assisting pastry chef at his father 's bakery in Bluff , Utah . Given his preference for healthful food , his experimentation with puff pastry was a deIighful aberration . In helping with my business , Julian had turned out to be worth his weight in Beluga caviar . Or radicchio , which he would prefer . But I knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want him to be bustling around making breakfast in addition to everything else . " Julian , let me do this , " I said gently . " Just let me finish ! " he said gruffly . He pulled a cookie sheet from the oven . The golden-brown pastry cylinders oozed melted chocolate . I was saved from having to deal with Julian 's hostility by the phone . " Goldilocks ' Catering ? " " Feeling good ? " " Yes , yes . " " How about this , then , " Tom Schulz said . " Are you feeling great ? " I could hear his grin . Unfortunately , I could also feel myself blush . " Of course , what do you expect ? " Something about my tone caused both Arch and Julian to turn inquiring faces in my direction . I turned away from them , coloring furiously . " Where are you ? " At work , drinking probably the worst coffee known to the human species . When can I see you again ? " I wanted that to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , but I was n't going to say so in front of Julian . " Lunch ? Can you come up here ? Aspen Meadow Cafe ? " " If you call the entrees that they serve at that place lunch , then sure . Noon . " And with that summary judgment of nouvelle cuisine , he rang off . " Arch , " I said when we were all munching the marvelous croissants , " you did n't tell me you called Tom Schulz about the snake . " Arch put down his croissant . " Mom , " he said with his earnest voice and look . " What , do you really think I 'm going w rely on Mr. Perkins to do anything for me ? Come on . " " Boy , you got that right , " Julian mumbled . " Still , " I insisted as gently as possible , " I want you to he careful to lay . Promise ? "  | He chirped , " Maybe I should just stay home from school . " " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even use your locker . " Julian lowered his eyebrows , and his mouth tightened stub-bornly . " Hey , I did n't put the snake in his locker , " I said defensively . " I despise vipers , rodents , and spiders . Detest them . Ask Arch . " " She does , " said Arch without being asked . " I ca n't have hamsters or gerbils . I ca n't even have an ant farm . " He swallowed the last bite of his croissant , wiped his mouth , and got up from the table . " You should add insects to that list . " Arch clomped upstairs to finish getting ready for school . As soon as he was gone , Julian leaned toward me conspiratorially . 1 1is haggard face made my heart ache . " I 'm going to help him with his classes . You know , set up a study schedule , encourage him , like that . We 're going to work in the dining room each night , if that 's okay with you . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have time to ? " My phone rang again . It was going to be one of those days . " Let me get it . " Julian jumped up and grabbed the receiver , but instead of giving my business greeting , ' he said , " Yeah ? " I certainly hoped it was not an Aspen Meadow Country Club client . Julian mouthed , " Greer Dawson , " and I shook my head . Julian said , " What ? You 're kidding . " Silence . " Oh , well , I 'm busy anyway . " Then he handed me the phone and said " Bitch " under his breath . I said , " Yes , Greer , what can I do for you ? " Her voice was high , stiff , formal . " I 've developed a new raspberry preserve I 'd like you to try , Goldy . It 's . . . exquisite . We want you to use it in a Linzertorte that you could make for the cafe . " " ( ) h , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me think about it , Greer. "  | " Well , how long will that take ? I need to know before the end of the school day so I can put it on my application that I have to get in the mail . " " Put what on your application ? " " That I developed a commercially successful recipe for raspberry preserve . " I detest ultimatums , especially those delivered before eight o'clock in the morning . " Tell your mother I 'll stop into the cak kitchen just before noon to try it out and talk to her about it . " Without waiting for an answer , I hung up . My croissant was cold . I turned to Julian . " What are you mad at her about ? " " We were supposed to be partners in quizzing each other before the SATs . I did n't do as well as I wanted to last year , toy nervous , I guess , so I really wanted to , you know , review . Miss Ferrell " ? he pronounced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says we should n't need this kind of cramming , but she encouraged us to go over a few things anyway . I quizzed Greer yesterday . But instead of quizzing me , Greer has to rush down to Denver for her last session of private SAT review . " His shoulders slumped . " Oh , well . It 'll give me more time to get started with Arch . We can use the school library . " " Why do n't you go to the SAT review with Greer ? " I asked innocently . He pushed his chair back from the table . " Where am I supposed to get a thousand bucks ? " It was a rhetorical question , and we both knew it . But before I could say that I would be more than happy to quiz him myself , Julian slammed out of the kitchen .  | ' Niter the boys left , I fixed a cup of espresso and took it out on the deck off the kitchen . Only a few pillows of white now floated across the sky . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch of snow . I brushed melting snow and ice off a redwood bench with one towel and sat on another . It was really t(u) cold to be outside , but the air felt invigorating . In the deep blue of the sky , the sun shone . The snow heaped on each tree branch glittered like mounds of sugar . It was the kind of moment where you wanted every clock and watch in the galaxy to stop . Yes , someone had horribly murdered Keith Andrews . And someone was threatening us ; Arch was having trouble in school ; loads of bookkeeping , cooking , and  | cleaning awaited me . I had people to call , food to order , schedules to set . But for the moment , that could all wait . I inhaled snowchilled air . The espresso tasted marvelously strong and rich . One thing I had learned in the past few years was that when the great moments came , you should stop and enjoy them , because they were n't going to last . And then the flowers began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papery white , yellow , and purple blossoms filled my hall and kitchen with their delicate sweet scent . Then came daisies with heather and an enormous basket of gladiolus , astromeria , and snapdragons . Finally , the florist handed me a box of longstemmed scarlet roses . He did n't know the occasion and looked to me for signals about whether to act sad or happy . I did n't give ally clues , so the fellow remained stony-faced . They must teach you to be emotionally removed in florist school . I arranged the roses in a tall ceramic vase Arch had made in the same sixth-grade art class that had produced the woodcut at Schulz 's . My kitchen smelled like a florist 's refrigerator . The phone rang . Apparently Schulz could n't wait to sec if the greenhouse had begun to arrive . I trilled , " Goldilocks ' Florist ? " " Huh ? Goldy ? You okay ? " Audrey Coopersmith . " No , " I said without missing a beat , " I need you to come help me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone nuts . " There was a pause . Tentatively , Audrey began , " Want me to call back in a little bit ? " Depressed people , especially those going through divorce , have a hard time with jokes . They need humor , but it 's like a bank account that has been suddenly frozen . Still , I would be the last one to explain . " Well , uh , " Audrey continued , floundering , " we 've goat a bit of a problem . Headmaster Perkins just called . He was wondering  | if we could bring out some cookies around lunchtime . They 're having an unofficial visit from the Stanford rep . " " Sorry to say , " I replied happily , " I 'm busy for lunch . " " But Goldy " ? and there was a distinct whine in her voice ? " I can help you . And I think it would be such a great experience for Heather to meet the Stanford representative . You see , Carl does n't care at all about where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with the responsibility . . . ca n't you just help me with this ? I 'm really going through a bad time now . . . it 's not that big a deal for you , probably , but . . . " Heather ? What did Heather have to do with the cookies ? I had to bake in order to pave the way for Heather Coopersmith to interview for the college of her dreams  --  correction , her mother 's dreams ? " Look , Audrey , I 'm in a good mood and I 'm trying to stay that way . Why did n't Perkins call me himself ? I could give the school some ideas about snacks for the Stanford rep . " " He said he tried to call you earlier but your line was busy . I 'm telling you , Goldy , he 's willing to pay for at least six dozen , and I can help by taking them over to the school , with Heather , of course , and the rep ? " She hesitated . " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elk Park Prep . They figure they do n't need to ? " " So give the guy some frozen yogurt ! Tell him to pretend he 's in northern California ! " Audrey sighed bleakly and said nothing . I guess I was n't acting like a caterer who wanted business , was I ? I made a few rapid calculations . Okay , there was the Rocky Mountain Stanford Club , maybe they 'd need a big catered luncheon sometime . And Stanford played the University of Colorado in football , so perhaps I could rustle up a tailgate affair in Boulder this fall or next . Impressing the rep might not be such a bad idea . " All right , " I said . " How about some granola ? " Audrey 's silence remained disapproving . " Just kidding . Look , I 'll come up  | with something . But Perkins needs to make very clear to this guy the name of the caterer making the cookies . And you can also tell Perkins this is going to cost him . Six dozen cookies arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure he wo n't object . He even asked if you could make a red and white cookie . You know , Stanford colors . He was thinking " ? and here she cleared her throat ? " of something like , like . . . barber-pole cookies or . . . dough candy canes or ? " " One of these days , that guy is going to choke and they 'll do CPR on his tongue . " Audrey said , " Is that a joke ? " " Also , " I added firmly , " I ca n't bring the cookies out to the school because of this lunch engagement . " " But that 's what I told you . Where are you going to be today ? I can pick them up . The logistics are getting a bit complicated anyway ? " " What logistics ? " She took another deep breath and I prepared for a lengthy explanation . " Oh , well , the Marenskys heard from Perkins th ; it the Stanford rep was coming , and they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't put Stanford on Brad Marensky 's college list , not that he would ever have a chance of getting in there , he 's fifth in the class , you know . . . let 's see . . . " Stir trailed off . " Logistics , " I said gently , to get her back on track . " Oh , yes , well . So Perkins told me he called the Marenskys ? no doubt because they 're such big donors to the school , although Perkins did n't mention that  --  and said Brad should b sure to see the Stanford rep today , and Rhoda Marensky demanded that they get a private audience with the guy ? " The pope from Palo Alto . I could just imagine this young fellow , entirely unaware of the intense power plays that his unannounced visit was engendering , or of the awesome authority currently being conferred on his head . so the Marenskys arc picking up the rep at the I-70 exit  | and driving him to the school , or at least they were until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they insisted that Greer get to meet with the fellow before the reception ever began ? " If in fact it ever did begin , I mentally amended . " And then Miss Ferrell thought she 'd better be present to arbitrate , so she gave her fourth period a study hall , which is when Heather has French , so of course I wanted her to meet the rep , since she did all that extra engineering work over the summer , and if they did n't have such a high percentage of minorities at that school , I think it 's forty-seven percent , then she would be a top contender ? " " What is the bottom line here , Audrey ? " " What are you so upset about ? " she asked , bewildered . " Where 's your lunch get-together ? I 'll pick up the cookies , and bring Heather to meet the Stanford rep , and Miss Ferrell can be there at the same time ? " " I 'll be at Aspen Meadow Cafe to taste jam at 11:45 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home ? " " Well you may ask , my dear Audrey , but it 's the Dawsons ' idea . No doubt they 'll also want you to taste some . I 'm sure they will want Julia Child , Paul Bocuse , and the Stanford rep to taste it too . " She sniffed . " Well , that does n't really make much sense , but I 'll see . Oh , something else . The Tattered Cover folks think it might be a good idea for you to come down to the store early , maybe an hour before the signing Halloween night ? I could show you where the third-floor kitchenette is , how they usually set up for a buffet , that kind of thing . " At last we were off the subject of the Stanford rep . Yes , I said , we should definitely case the third floor of the bookstore ahead of time . We decided Audrey would come over to my place after the penitential luncheon Friday so we could head down to Denver together . Then Audrey asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florist ? Are you thinking of expanding your business ? "  | " Sorry , I thought you were somebody else . " " . . . Not meaning to be disrespectful , Goldy , but maybe you need a vacation . " That made two of us . I was still laughing when Tom Schulz called . " Does n't the caterer sound merry . " " She is , she is . First she had a great time with this cop last night . " He mm-hmmed . I went on . " This morning , though , she flunked out of surrogate-parenting . But to her rescue came this same cop , who quickly turned her house into the Denver Botanic Garden . Now for the rest of the day she has to make cookies , kowtow to some guy from California , taste jam , and have lunch with the cop . " " Uh-huh . Sounds normal to me . Glad you like the flowers . " " Love them . You are too generous . But listen , I need to tell you some stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egon Schlichtmaier 's allegedly shabby history and current alleged affair , along with the possibility that these items were going to get some journalistic exposure at the hands of the ambitious Keith An drews . " Okay , look , " he said when I 'd finished , " I may be a bit late for lunch . I 'm going down to check on a murder in Lakewood . Ordinarily , it would n't involve me . But the victim 's name was Andrews . " I was instantly sober . " Any relation to the late valedicto-rian ? " " Not that we can figure out . The victim 's name was Kathy . They found her body in a field two weeks ago . Her head had been bashed in . Suspect is her ex-boyfriend , who owed her a couple thousand , but the investigators down there ca n't find hint . Anyway , one of the things they 're looking at is that Kathy Andrews ' mail was stolen . And get this  --  she had an account at Neiman-Marcus . K Andrews ' on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . Was it a robbery/murder ? " " " That 's the strange thing . Kathy Andrews was single , had  | lot of money that she liked to spend . Looks like a lot of her mail might have been stolen , from the way she was complaining to the local post office . Maybe somebody was in the act of stealing letters and she caught them . That 's what the Lakewood guys are trying to reconstruct . " " Why would someone steal her mail ? " " Same reason they take your purse , Miss G. For cash or checks , is what we usually see . Or vandalism . They 're going through all Kathy Andrews ' stuff , trying to check back with what she might have been expecting . But when something that was mailed  --  in this case a credit card  --  does n't show up , you wonder . According to their records , Neiman-Marcus mailed it sometime in the last month . " I touched the phone wire , then quickly let go of it . I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . Kathy Andrews . " Did you talk to the Marenskys about their raccoon coat ? " " They claim it was stolen at some party . " " Well , I 'm confused . " " You 're not alone , Miss G. See you around noon . " Something red and white . Not a barber pole , not a candy cane , not an embarrassed zebra . Something worthy of a visit from the school that had produced Nobel Prize winners , Pulitzer Prize winners , Jim Plunkett , and John Elway . Since I thought a football-shaped cookie would be a bit too difficult to manage on such short notice , I decided on a rich white cookie with a red center . I beat butter with cream cheese and let my mind wander back to Julian . His abrupt departure that morning left me troubled . Julian , in his fourth year at Elk Park Prep , was bright and extremely competent . He had stunned me with the creativity of his project on I ) NA research . But his classmates were smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  | Red ' n ' Whites 1 cup ( 2 sticks ) unsalted butter , softened 1 3-ounce package cream cheese , softened 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 36 small ripe strawberries , hulled and halved Preheat the oven to 350 ? . In a mixing bowl , beat the butter with the cream cheese until well blended . Beat in the sugar and vanilla , then stir in the flour until well mixed . Using a ' /z-tablespoon measure , shape the mixture into small balls and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets . Make a small indentation in the top of each cookie with your thumb . Carefully place a strawberry half , cut side down , in each indentation . Bake for 12 to 18 minutes or until very lightly browned . Cool on racks . Makes 5 dozen .  | in all their academic pursuits . I creamed in sugar and then swirled in dark , exotic-smelling Mexican vanilla , which I sniffed heartily . Julian cared about his school , not with a rah-rah cheerleader spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to risk a fight with Keith Andrews to keep a scandal out of the newspapers . I sifted flour in to make a stiff batter . Julian was passionate about people and cooking . The latter trait , I had long ago decided , was another way of being passionate about people . For all those therapy bills , I 'd figured out a few things . As my spatula scraped the golden batter off the sides of the howl , I recalled the shy and happy look that had begun to creep over Julian 's usually hostile face during the past summer , whenever Schulz or Arch or I had begged him to make his tortellini della panna , spinach pie in filo , or fudge with sun-dried cherries . Julian cared about me and about Schulz , and he was wild about Arch . The events of the past week had caused him great strain . Poor overwrought eighteen-year-old , I thought , what can I do to help you care less about us and more about your future ? I stared at the creamy concoction . My supplier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to cut them up and use them to top each cookie , for the red and white effect . The things a caterer is called upon , to do . I rolled dainty half-tablespoonfuls of dough into spheres , thumb-printed the lot , and then put a half of a strawberry , seed-side up , in the little indentations . I slapped the cookie sheets into the oven , set the timer , then fixed another espresso . Fifteen minutes later I was munching on the luscious results . They were like tiny cheesecakes , something you would have at an English tea . I decided to dub them something catchy . Red ' n ' Whites , maybe . And speaking of something catchy , I decided then and there to beg Julian to let me help him with the SAT drillquestions , if he was still interested . How hard could it be ? I already knew the opposite of tranquil : today 's lunch .  | Two hours later , toting three doily-covered trays and a wrapped package of six dozen Red ' n ' Whites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cafe . The Dawsons had tried hard to make their restaurant appear as continental as possible . There was no question that the cafe 's sleek , glassed exterior was a far cry from the more casual health food and Western barbecue spots that peppered Aspen Meadow , places where tourists or construction workers or psychic massage practitioners could grab a noontime bite . No , the folks who frequented this cafe were , for the most part , not the kind who had to go out and work for a living , at least not full-time . Or they belonged to a growing group of professionals who could put on cowboy hats and wander out for a two-hour lunch . I eased the van between a Mercedes ( license plate : LOIR ; I guess ATURNIE was already taken ) and Buick Riviera ( URSIK ; now , how was that to inspire confidence in an M.D. ? ) . The cafe was sandwiched in the dark-paneled , turquoise-trimmed shopping center known as Aspen Meadow North . There was Aspen Meadow Florist , whose blossoms Schulz had recently decimated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window display . Tasteful Halloween decorations adorned the windows of upscale boutiques . Next to the cafe was the in decorated window of Aspen Meadow Weight Control Center . Alt , irony ! I entered the cafe and passed the baskets of braided breads and puffed brioches , passed the cheese case with its Stiltons , Camemberts , and buffalo mozzarellas , and came up to the glass case of desserts . Luscious-looking apricot cream tortes , multi layered chocolate mousse cakes , and all manner of truffles called out for attention . I closed my eyes , trying to imagine the exclamations of delight that would greet my Happy Endings Plum Cake when it held a prominent place in front of the displayed concoc-tions . Audrey had already arrived with I leather , whose polity ex-  | pression and slumped posture next to the Stiltons did not indicate happy-camper status . Audrey , utterly oblivious to her daughter 's funk , sidled up to me and warned , " I made the mistake of asking the Dawsons if Greer had anything to impress the Stanford rep with . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom and changed into a red and white outfit . Now they 're all awaiting your presence in the kitchen for the big taste test . Oh . " She lifted one eyebrow in her wide , humorless face . " The jam 's putrid . Better say you 'll make the Linzertorte they want at home . " Too much . I said , " Any sign of the Marenskys ? Or Miss Ferrell ? " She pressed her lips together . " Ferrell 's in the kitchen . I do n't know about the Marenskys . " I said wishfully , " Is the jam just tart ? Would it be better with some sugar mixed in ? " The smile she gave me oozed smugness . " Believe me , Goldy , you could take the sugar made by every beet farmer in eastern Colorado and put it in that jam , and it would still taste like solidified vinegar . " " Thanks , Audrey , " I said dryly . " I trust you did n't let your opinion show . " " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Great , " I said as the Dawsons approached . They were like a human phalanx . " Hey , Hank ! Great game Sunday . " His face turned even more grim at my greeting . " They were lucky , you know that , Goldy . Washington 's going to be tough . About as tough as this Stanford guy . We 've just been talking about how to play him . " " I do n't know why the Marenskys are even bothering to bring Brad , " said Caroline primly . " Everyone knows Stanford is as demanding as the Ivy League schools . They never take anyone below the top ten percent . "  | I murmured , " But in a school as small as Elk Park Prep ? " " Never ! " she interrupted me , her small dark eyes glowing . " Did n't you hear me ? " I was saved assuring her that my hearing was fine by the cheerful jingle of the bell hung over the cafe door . Stan Marensky came through , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets in a full-length fur coat , not the raccoon thing . She was followed by a diminutive fellow , presumably the Stanford rep . He wore blue jeans , a bow tie , and no coat . Bringing up the rear was Brad Marensky , a broad-shouldered boy who wore shorts and an Elk Park Prep varsity tennis T-shirt , despite the fact that it was about thirty-eight degrees outside . The diminutive fellow glanced around the cafe . He did not look so very powerful to me . Yet beside me , Audrey Coopersmith was visibly trembling . " Audrey , " I said in as comforting a tone as I could muster , " please relax . This is simply not as important as you make it out to be . " Her look was chill . " You just do n't get it , Goldy . " The Marenskys were chatting in loud , possessive tones to the Stanford rep . They seemed extraordinarily pleased with them - selves , and acted as if some very important business had been resolved in the ten-minute car ride from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marenskys , who were both as thin as models , ignored me , the short , rotund Dawsons were always curious about my every word or thought . Hank Dawson leaned in close . " They sure seem smug . I wonder what they could have told him about Brad ? That kid 's only number five in the class , he 'll never make it . I need to get that guy away from them . Punt or go for it ? " " Go for it , " I said without hesitation . " Welcome to our little restaurant . " Caroline Dawson 's lilting voice pronounced restaurant with a French accent . I cringed . The Marenskys turned into two skinny ice sculptures as they watched  | Caroline Dawson waddle forward in one of her trademark crimson suits . " We 'd like to take you into the kitchen , " Caroline Dawson declared . She grasped the young man 's arm firmly . Once she had him in tow , she indicated with a move of her head that she wanted me to follow her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is third in her class , is by the Hobart , " she said with great sweetness . " I 'm so glad you came out on an early ski trip , " she added as if she and the unfortunate rep were old chums . " Should I kneel and kiss his ring ? " I asked Audrey Coopersmith , who had timidly followed me in while tugging Heather 's sleeve to bring her along . The Marenskys , trying to appear cool and unruffled , marched out into the kitchen to see what the Dawsons were up to with the rep . While we were all assembling in the kitchen , Caroline engaged the Stanford rep in lively , empty conversation . Miss Ferrell , drinking coffee and leaning against a sink , had a pained look on her face . Well , that ought to teach the college counselor not to host unexpected reps . She click-clacked her way over to me on her tiny heels . " I have a teachers ' meeting in Denver the next couple of days , Ms. Bear , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you about Julian as soon as I get back . Can you free up some time ? He came to see me this morning , and of course he 's very upset about what happened to Arch . . . but he also has a number of questions about Keith . Oh , this all has become so ( lark ? " She jerked back abruptly , suddenly aware that Audrey , I lank Dawson , and the Marenskys were all keen to hear what she had to say . " What questions about Keith ? " I asked . " He was having some problems ? " she began in a low voice . She looked around . The Marenskys began to whisper to rich other . Hank reached for a cabinet door while Audrey pretended to he intensely perusing a menu she had found on the  | counter . " Some problems with this college thing , " Miss Ferrell whispered . " How about chatting Saturday morning before the tests ? " I whispered back . I sneaked a sidelong glance at Audrey , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . It was hard to tell whether she was listening . " I 'll be setting up that breakfast out at the school . " Miss Ferrell nodded and turned on her heels and clickclacked back to the Stanford rep . Greer Dawson had made her appearance from the back end of the kitchen . As Audrey had predicted , the teenager was wearing a red and white striped shirt . The skirt matched . Her golden hair curled angelically around her diminutive heart-shaped face . I was reminded of the Breck girl . Daintily , Greer reached for a utensil and spooned a mouthful of the raspberry jam into the rep 's reluctantly open mouth . Apparently , Greer did n't want me to preempt the rep in the tasting . With startling suddenness the rep 's face took on the look of a two-week-old kiwi fruit . He said in a high , uncertain voice over the expectant hush iii the room , " What ? No sweetener ? " Everyone immediately began bustling around , trying to make up for this faux pas . Everyone , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear and jeered , " Nanny-nanny-nana . " " Ah , well . " Hank Dawson hustled forward . " This jam is still in development , I mean , this is a new batch , and Greer 's just a rookie chef , after all , you can hardly judge ? " " We 'll let Goldy decide , " Caroline Dawson announced periously . " After all , she 's the one Greer 's been studying with . " Oh , blame it on the caterer ! Well , excuse me , but the only thing Greer had studied while she was with me was whether you served pie with a spoon or a fork . Up until now , the girl haul never shown even the slightest inkling of interest in food preparation . Of course , I knew what this setup was all about . If I pretended to love the jam , I 'd get a Iinrertortc job in addition to the plum cake assignment , and I 'd show up Miss Derrell and you r  | Audrey . Not to mention the Stanford guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could forget about a Stanford tailgate picnic , and I could go elsewhere to peddle my plum cake . I also had the discomforting premonition that Schulz might walk in at any moment on this ridiculous scenario . The things a caterer has to do for business . I stalled . " Fresh spoon ? " " In there . " Audrey motioned to a wooden drawer . I pulled the drawer open . It held one of those plastic fourpart silverware trays . Each section bulged with utensils . I reached toward the spoon section , desperately attempting to imagine sweet jam . " I 'll get a big one , " I said loudly . But I was n't going to taste jam that day . I should have looked more closely at the small object in the spoon section , the shiny black round form , the red hourglass on the bottom of its dark belly . But by the time I had the sense to draw back my hand , I had already been bitten by the black widow .  | " Omigod ! " I screeched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey , all pressed forward with urgent queries : What happened ? Are you all right ? A spider ? Are you sure ? Where ? I backed up , my left hand clutching my right wrist . The stinging crept up my finger and into my palm . Furiously , I thought , Why did it have to be my right hand ? I backed hard into Stan Marensky . When I whirled around , he appeared stunned . Involuntary tears filled my eyes . Hank Dawson ran to the phone , Caroline Dawson began comforting a screaming Greer , the Marenskys demanded of one another and of a gaping Brad what the hell was going on , Miss  | Ferrell splashed cold water over a paper towel . Audrey was on her knees , looking for the spider , which she was convinced I had shaken out onto the floor . The poor Stanford guy was standing stock-still , his mouth gaping . You could see his mind working : This place is weird . " Uh-uh , " I said to the familiar person lumbering fast into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he demanded . He reached out for my forearm and examined the spot I was pointing to on my right index finger . It was swelling up and reddening . And it burned . I mean , my hand was on fire . From the floor , Audrey hollered up at him : " Do something , take her to the hospital , she 's been bitten by a poisonous spider , do something . . . " Tom Schulz gripped my shoulders . " Goldy , " he said , demanding my gaze . " Was it small and brown ? " I said , " Uh . . . uh . . . " " Would you know a brown recluse ? " " It was n't . . . that was n't . . . " He seemed relieved , then raised his eyebrows . He said , " Black widow ? " and I nodded . To each of his questions ? " Are you allergic ? Do you know ? " ? I shook my head and gave a helpless gesture . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often does one get bitten by a poisonous arachnid ? Hank Dawson trundled rapidly back into the kitchen . His voice cracked when he announced , " Oh , God , all the ambulances in the entire mountain area are tied up ! Is she going to be all right ? Should one of us take her to a hospital ? Is she gon na die ? What ? " Schulz hustled me out of there . Amid the siren , lights , squeal of tires , and Schulz 's inability to get his cellular phone to work , we hightailed it out of Aspen Meadow North and got onto Interstate 70 . As the dun-brown hills whizzed by , I held my hand by the wrist like a tourniquet . I tried to think of the spider venom as  | a toxic black ink that I was willing to stay in my palm and not travel through my veins into the bloodstream . Once we were on I-70 , Schulz 's cellular phone kicked in and he announced to Dispatch where he was going . Then he called the poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Denver General Hospital . It had the closest source of antivenin , they told Schulz . My hand burned . Cursing the welling tears and my shaking voice , I asked , " Is n't this supposed to go away or something ? It 's not really poisonous , is it ? " He kept his eyes on the road as we whipped past a truck . " Depends . Brown recluse would 've been worse . " I cleared my throat . " I have to be able to take care of Arch . . . . " I was beginning to perspire heavily . Each time I took a breath , the bite throbbed . It was like being in labor . Schulz said , " Feel nauseated ? " I told him no . After a minute he said , " You 're not going to die . I do n't know why you go into that damn cafe , though . Last summer somebody pushed you into a glass case there . I 'm telling you , Goldy , that place and you do n't mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp . I stared at my swollen finger , now overcome with a dull , numbing pain . Strangely , I also felt a hardening pain developing between my shoulders . I took a breath . Agony . " I 'm beginning to hurt all over . How 'm I going to cook ? Why did it have to be my right hand ? " He flicked me a look . " Why did it have to be you at all ? " Headache squeezed my temples mercilessly . I whispered , " Good thing you came along when you did . " " The posse , " he said impassively . In the emergency room a bleached-blond nurse asked in a clipped voice about allergies and insurance . A dark-coomplected doctor asked about how long ago this had happened and what I had been doing to make the spider bite me . Some people . While the doctor examined the bite , I closed my eyes and did Lamaze breathing . The childbirth experience , like the divorce experience ,  | can give you a reservoir of behaviors to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor finally decreed that invenomation had not been severe . I did not , he said , need to be hospitalized . He checked my vital signs , then told me to take hot baths this afternoon and tonight , to relieve the muscular pain in my back . When I asked about working , he said I might be cooking again by tomorrow , that I should see how I felt . Before he breezed out he said tonight was for rest . " Oh , gosh , " I exclaimed , suddenly remembering , " the red and white cookies for the school ! I do n't know if Audrey remembered them ! " " Goldy , please , " said Schulz , " why not let somebody else ? " " I ca n't , I worked all morning on those things , " I said stubbornly , and scooted off the examination table . Dizziness rocked me as soon as my feet hit the ground . Shaking his head , Schulz held my arm as we walked down the hall to a pay phone . He punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the barrage of frantic queries from Hank Dawson . Finally , sighing , Schulz handed me the phone . Hank 's inquiries about whether I was okay were immediately followed by a volley of questions designed to ascertain whether I was going to sue him . No , I would n't contemplate legal action , I promised , if he would retrieve the platters of cookies from my van and get them over to the prep school . Hank said Audrey had left in her " usual high-strung state " and had forgotten them , but that he would make sure they were delivered . Somewhat ruefully , he added that the Stanford rep had worried aloud about hygiene conditions at the cafe . To add insult to injury , I Link informed me , the rep had n't even stayed for a free lunch . Greer 's future at Stanford did n't look so hot . After what seemed like an interminable wait  --  I could n't decide if the doctor was waiting for me to die , get better , or just disappear  --  the blond nurse reappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me home . I felt embarrassed to have taken so much of his time , and said so . He chuckled . " Are you kidding ? Most exciting lunch I 've had all week . " Audrey Coopersmith 's white pickup truck sat in front of my house . Audrey got out , and with her shoulders rolled inward , marched with her long duck-walk stride up to my front porch : the first official greeter . Bless her , she had brought a cellophanewrapped bouquet of carnations . As Schulz and I came slowly up the walk , she stood , feet apart , hands clasping the flowers behind her back . Her face seemed frozen in anxiety . Schulz still held me gently by the right elbow , but he lifted his chin and squinted his eyes , appraising Audrey . Under his breath he said , " Have you introduced me to this Mouseketeer ? " " Do n't . " When we got to the front door , Audrey wordlessly thrust the flowers at me . Then , seeing my bandaged hand , she awkwardly drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks and reluctantly asked her to come in . It took me a minute to remember my security code . Put it down to spider toxin fuzzing the brain . After some fumbling we all stood in my kitchen . Audrey 's eyes widened at the vases and baskets of roses , daisies , freesias , astromeria . The kitchen smelled like a flower show . " Gosh . Guess you did n't need carnations after all . " " Of course I did , now , meet my friend , " I said , and introduced her to Schulz , who was already ferreting through the freezer to dig out ice cubes for my finger . Schulz wiped his hands and courteously addressed her . I added that Audrey was a temporary helper for the catering business along with her work at the Tattered Cover . Schulz cocked his head and said he remembered that Audrey was one of the people who had helped me out the night of the Keith Andrews fatality . She pressed her lips together . Her nostrils flared . " Well , Al-  | fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisory evenings . " " Yes , " said Schulz with his Santa Claus grin , " going down to the bookstore , right ? Terrific place . Will you be helping Goldy on Friday too ? " Mr. Charm . Audrey visibly relaxed and said yes to both questions . The edges of her mouth may have been starting to turn up in one of her rare grins . Then again , maybe it was my imagination . We were saved from more banter by the telephone . Schulz gestured toward it and raised his eyebrows at me , as in , Should I get it ? I nodded . It was my mother , calling from New Jersey because she had just heard that there had been a big snowstorm in Colorado . I try to tell my parents , This time of year , there is always lots of snow falling somewhere in the Rockies . Why this meteorological condition is so profoundly newsworthy for the national networks is beyond me . We take the precipitation in stride ; the dire announcements just worry Coloradans ' relatives who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I could keep the ice cubes on my right hand . " Goldy ! Is that the policeman you 've been seeing ? Why is he at your house in the middle of the day ? " So much for the snow crisis . But if I told my mother what had just happened , there would be another flood of worried questions . I had never even told her Schulz was a homicide investigator . If she learned that , all hell would break loose . " He 's just helping me out , " I told her . " I 've , uh , had a bit of sickness . " My mother 's high voice grew panicked . " Not morning sickness . . ? " Mother . Please . It 's past lunch here , thus well after morning . Not only that , but we 've had only a tiny amount of snow , and Arch is due home any second ? " " Tell me again , " she pressed , " is Zorn Schulz somebody you knew from ( ; . U. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a college graduate . If she could n't have a doctor for a son-inlaw , Mom would at least go for well educated . I said , " No , not from C.U . " I wanted to say , Last night I had my emotional life changed by this guy . . . today he drove me down to the hospital and back in a life-threatening situation , you 're not going to believe this , Mother , I 've finally found somebody who really cares about me . . . . The phone slipped out of my left hand and bounced off the floor . Her more distant voice persisted . " But he 's not just . . . somebody you met , is he ? This is n't going to be someone you just . . . picked up at a policeman 's picnic or ? ? " I picked up the phone . " Mother . No . This is someone " ? I looked at Schulz and smiled ? " very special , very smart . He is unique . He knows all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job with an equal-opportunity employer . " " Oh , God , he 's colored ? " " Mother ! " I promised to call over the weekend , and hastily said good-bye . Schulz eyed me askance . " Did n't quite measure up , did I ? " " I heard her , " Audrey said , and mimicked my mother 's voice , " Someone you picked up ? ' Sorry , Goldy . Why do women of our mothers ' generation worry so much about what kind of man we 're seeing or married to ? Why do n't they worry about how we 're doing ? That 's what I tell Heather , I 'm worried about you , honey , not some boy you might be dating and what his background is . ' " Audrey moved to the sink and poured herself a glass of water . She finished with , " You should have told her Schulz went to Harvard . " " Oh , Lord , do n't remind me , " groaned Schulz . He turned and gave me a half-grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a few things cleared up , and the headmaster asked me where I went to school . " He shrugged . " I did n't know what he meant , so I said , Well , first there was North Peak Elementary ? ' and old Perkins waved his hand and said , Stop right there . ' "  | I was shocked . This hurt as much as the spider bite . How dare Perkins insult Schulz , who was in every way his superior ? I felt the slight as keenly as if Perkins had criticized Arch . " That imbecile ! " I blurted out . Schulz turned his unruffled , seawater-green gaze at me . I felt my face redden and a flip-flop tighten my abdomen . " Not to worry , Miss G. I know the difference between a person who 's educated enough to handle life 's challenges and a person who just needs to brag all the time . " Audrey 's mouth sagged open . She said , " Make that the difference between a woman who can handle life 's challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Schulz said , " Hmm . " I did n't know where this was going and I did n't care . But Schulz was interested . To Audrey , he said , " Er , tell me what you mean . Audrey 's tone was defiant . " That 's what I 'm trying to teach Heather . I say , Get ahead now , honey , while you 're young , you do n't want to get stuck taking care of some man 's socks and ego . ' " She took a shuddering breath . " You see , if you do n't get ahead when you 're young , if you just let things go along , if you trust people . . . A cloud of bitterness soured her features . " Oh , never mind . All I want is for Heather to have things I never had . She is phenomenally talented , " she said , animated again . " She ran the virtual reality simulator this summer for exploring Mars . " She glared at us fiercely . " Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair and gave Audrey and me a benevolent , questioning grin . " Success , huh ? " When we had no response , he got up out of his chair and cocked his head at us . " You feeling okay , Goldy ? " When I said I thought so , he added , " I 'm going to make some tea . " We were silent while Schulz rummaged for cups , saucers ,  | and a pot , and then drew water . Finally Audrey said glumly , " Success is what I 'm not . " She ticked off on her fingers . " No meaningful work or career , no relationship , no money . . . " Well , I was not going to interrupt my part-time assistant and say , catering is meaningful work for some of us , if not for you . Catering pays the bills . That 's my definition of meaning-ful . Schulz said , " I grew up in eastern Colorado and paid for my own college education until I was drafted . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Criminalistics , University of Colorado at Denver . " He frowned . " I 've killed people and thought it was wrong , killed them and thought it was right . Some criminals I catch and some I do n't . I make a good salary and I 'm unmarried , no kids . " He rubbed his chin , watching Audrey . " But I think of myself as a success . In fact " ? here he gave me a wink ? " I 'm getting more successful all the time . " " Huh , " said Audrey . The teakettle whistled . Schulz moved efficiently around the kitchen , first ladling in China black tea leaves , then pouring a steaming stream of water into the pot . He ducked into the refrigerator and came out with a dish of leftover Red ' n ' Whites . I glanced at my watch : 3:00 . Arch and Julian would be home within the hour , and we had nothing for dinner . Maybe Julian would want to cook . This time he 'd get no argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her teacup and saucer . The cup made a chittering sound as Schulz slowly filled it . Audrey did not look at me when she went on . " . . . I did n't go to a school where I could make something out of myself . If only I had studied math , instead of . . . " The pain in my hand was getting worse . I was having trouble focusing on Audrey 's voice , whine whine , Caltech , whine whine Mount Holyoke , Heather 's always been so gifted . Sudden exhaustion swept over me . I dreaded telling Arch and Julian about the spider bite . I longed to take my first doctor-prescribed hot bath . But now Audrey was complaining about how the best possible  | thing for Heather would be a big science-oriented school in California or the Northeast , since they had the best reputations and would assure her of landing a great job once she graduated . Maybe it was the bite , maybe it was my mood , maybe I had just had it with this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not going to make a person . You make it sound like it 's sex or something ! " Schulz turned down the edges of his mouth in an effort not to laugh . He cleared his throat with a great rumbly sound and said , " Oh , yeah ? Like sex ? This ought to be interesting . Goldy ? You have n't touched your tea . " I slouched back and obligingly sipped . " Let me tell you , my college counselor promised me the moon and I believed her . " Audrey said , " Really ? Where did you go ? " I told her ; she was impressed . She said , " Gosh ! A camel's-hair coat in every closet ! " " Spare me . " I remembered undergraduate nights shivering in freezing rain mixed with snow . I did n't recall ever seeing a camel's-hair coat . I sighed . " Where do these reputations come from ? People think , If you go to this or that college , you 're in . Go to this or that school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great job and be a successful person . What a joke . " " She 's getting cynical in her old age , " Schulz told Audrey out of the side of his mouth . Then to me , brightly , " Would you pass the sugar ? " " I mean , just look at the catalogue . " I slid Schulz the sugar howl with my good hand . " Look at the close-up shots of Gothic spires . . . they do it that way so you wo n't see the smog . Look at the good-looking well-dressed preppy white Anglo-Saxon Protestant females striding together across the lush green campus . They and their friends vacated the campus over the weekend , while the less attractive girls stayed alone in the dorms , their minuscule numbers at meals an indictment of their own unpopularity . " I put down my teacup and held my hands open as if perusing an imaginary brochure . " Wow ! Look at the picture of that ener-  | getic lecturer and those students eagerly taking notes  --  that must be a fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The class is required for your major , but it took you three and a half years to get into it ! Complain to your parents , as I did , and they say , For this we 're paying thousands a year ? ' " I sipped tea and gave them a wide grin . " Man , I just loved going to a big-name school . " Schulz explained placidly to Audrey , " Goldy has an excitable temperament . " " Nah , " I said , surprised by the passion in my little diatribe . " What the heck , I even give the school money . " The phone rang . Schulz raised his eyebrows at me again , and again I nodded . This time it was Julian . He had heard about the spider incident when Hank Dawson fulfilled his promise and delivered the cookies . Julian was frantic . Schulz tried to lighten it up by saying , " I 've warned her not to try to cook with spiders , " but Julian was having none of it . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me talk to him . " When Schulz resignedly handed me the phone , I said , " Julian , I 'm fine , I want you to quit worrying about me ? " " Who put that spider in the drawer ? " he yelled . " Miss Ferrell ? Trying to take attention away from her other problems ? " " Whoa , Julian . Of course Miss Ferrell did n't put it in the drawer . Come on . Everybody knows black widows live all over Colorado . I hardly think Miss Ferrell , or anybody else for that matter , would deliberately try something nasty like that . " " Want to bet ? She just told me she does n't know anything about food science ! I 'll bet she does n't think it 's worthy . She 's not going to give me a good recommendation , I know it . She 's a class A bitch from the word go . " " I 'll talk to her , " I volunteered . " Lot of good that 'll do , " he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , pained , resigned sigh . " What else is going on ? " I asked , concerned . " You sound terrible . "  | " We 're all staying until about six . There 's a vocabulary-review thing going on in Ferrell 's room . Arch is in the library , do n't worry . We 'll just be home late . " " How was the Stanford rep ? Did you have some cookies ? " " Oh , the room was packed . I did n't go . " He paused . " Sheila Morgenstern told me she mailed in her early decision application to Cornell . She 's sixth in our class , but she got 1550 combined on her SATs last year . I 'm happy for her , I guess , but it 's bad for me . Cornell will never take two kids from the same school . Especially if one of them is n't going to get a good recommendation from the college counselor . " " Oh , come on , sure they will , Julian . You 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silence . " Goldy , " Julian said evenly , " I know you mean well . Really , I do . But honestly , you do n't know a thing . " " Oh , " I mumbled , staring at my swollen finger . Maybe he was right . My life did seem to be a mess at the moment . " I did n't mean to ? " " Aah , forget about it . To make things worse , I flunked a French quiz this morning . And I flunked a history quiz too . Not my day , I guess . " " Flunked . . . ? " " Oh , I was tired , and then Ferrell asked five questions about the subjunctive . Schlichtmaier asked about Lafayette , and I guess I missed that part when he talked about him . " He mocked , " well , we do n't know for shoor . . " " Do n't , " I said . " Yeah , yeah , I know , do n't be prejudiced . Forgot to mention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in there . " There was a silence . " And hey , I 'm not the one making fun of Schlichtmaier . I stick up for him every chance I get . " " I 'm sure you do . " But Julian 's tone had again grown savage . " You want to know the truth , the guy who used to make fun of him is dead . "  | Now , that 's a happy note . " I hung up the phone , somehow managing not to bang my injured finger . " Julian says I am totally ' ignorant . And worse , he 's afraid Miss Ferrell is n't going to write him a good recommendation for Cornell . " " He 's sunk , " proclaimed Audrey . " He wo n't get in now if he invents a solar-powered car . " " Oh , give me a break . " " Come on , " Schulz interjected . " That 's just the kind of car we need down at the Sheriff 's Department . " Audrey smiled shyly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeked under the bandage and saw that the redness had resolved itself into an enormous , ugly blister . I pondered it  | glumly . Schulz poured more tea . He was n't going anywhere , and I did n't know whether this sudden lack of purpose stemmed from concern for me or curiosity about Audrey . I suspected the latter . Audrey got to her feet . She left the bouquet of carnations on the table beside her empty teacup . " Well , I suppose I ought to be moving on . Think you 're going to be okay to cook Friday ? It 's just a few days away . " I held out my hands helplessly , as in , Do I have a choice ? I told her she could come by at six . " And thanks for the flowers . They 're a great addition to the shop here . " " I 'll walk you out , " Schulz volunteered with unnecessary enthusiasm . I looked puzzled . He ignored me . Outside , he stood talking with Audrey for a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments he came hack , slowly sat in one of my kitchen chairs , then gently lifted my right hand and examined it . " I have to ask you the obvious , you know . Do you think that spider was intended for you ? Or for somebody else ? " " I do not believe it was intended for me , or anyone else for that matter , " I replied firmly . " There was a lot of confusion in the kitchen , a big crowd , a lot of chitchat about tasting jam . " I saw my hand , as if in slow motion , go into the silverware drawer . " It just happened . " He mused about this for a while . For the first time I noticed the care he had used to dress for our lunch : pinstripe shirt , rep tie , knitted vest , corduroy pants . While I was looking him over , he winked and said , " Audrey did n't mention going to college her-self . " " She went , all right , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said her bike ran over fish on her way to classes . And I guess the classes themselves were awful . Dates were nonexistent . And everyone at her high school had told her it was going to be this wonderful experience . She got some therapy there at the  | school clinic . She hated that too . She finally concluded that what was making her unhappy was the school itself . So she left and got married . And now the marriage is breaking up . " Schulz gave me his impassive face . " How long 's she had that pickup truck , do you know ? " The question was so unexpected that I laughed . " Gosh , Officer , I do n't know . For as long as I 've known her . Maybe it 's part of her financial settlement . My theory is that she drives it because it 's part of her image . " Schulz squinted at me . " Think she 's capable of killing some-body ? " My skin went cold . I said , choosing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you suspect ? " " Remember K. Andrews down in Lakewood ? " When I nodded , he continued . " I went down , questioned all the neighbors , even though the Lakewood guys had already done it . Hardly anyone 's around during the day , and nobody saw anything unusually suspicious . A blue Mercedes , a silver limousine , an old white pickup , maybe a new ice cream truck . No identifying features . One young mother glanced out her window and saw somebody stopped at Kathy Andrews ' mailbox one day . She 'd already reported it . Something unusual , ' she says , something out of place . That 's all I can remember . ' " " Something out of place ? " I said , puzzled . " A moving van ? A flying saucer ? Is that all you could get out of her ? " " Hey ! Do n't think I did n't try . I say , Not a car from the neighborhood ? Not Fed Ex or UPS ? ' She shakes her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , no , ' she says , it was something it was too late for , just one instant , there and then gone . ' That 's all that registered with her . I say , Too late for what ? The mail ? ' And she says , I just do n't know . ' " " So you checked with all the delivery people , limousine people , and nobody was late for anything . " " Correct . Nadu . Same as the Lakewood guys found . " llc sipped his cold tea . " Then I see Ms. Audrey Coopersmith 's pickup  | truck parked out front of your house , and I think , an old white pickup , ' the way one of the other neighbors said . Kathy Andrews ' old boyfriend drove a pickup , I found out . Would you say Audrey Coopersmith 's truck looks old ? " " Old ? I guess it 's not new and shiny . . . but why would Audrey steal some woman 's credit card in Lakewood and then beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most frequent kind of credit-card fraud we have is a woman  --  excuse me , Miss G. ? anyway , getting her friends ' cards and signing their names to her purchases . Audrey works in Denver at the bookstore , and maybe she goes across the street to Neiman-Marcus on her break , sees some gal make a purchase , and the saleslady says , Thank you , Miss Andrews , ' and Miss Andrews says , You can call me Kathy . ' So maybe Audrey , who is having all these money problems , thinks of Keith Andrews , a convenient place to dump the card if things got hot . Then again , maybe all this investigating he was doing for the paper got him on her path . " " Pretty farfetched , I 'd say . I mean , you can see for yourself that we 're not exactly talking a designer wardrobe . ' ? ' He smiled grimly . " But she was at that college advisory dinner , she has some unresolved feelings about her own past and present , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Keith , Andrews . " Again the raised eyebrows . " And she was at the cafe today when you were there with the Dawsons and Miss Ferrell . Maybe she put the spider in the drawer and it was intended for someone else , like the college counselor . Was she at the school the day Arch found the rattler in his locker ? " With a sickening feeling I remembered Audrey standing in the hall , telling me the headmaster wanted to see me . My finger ached dully . " Yes , " I said , " she was . " Schulz asked to use my phone . When he had finished telling someone to check on Audrey Coopersmith 's vehicle and background , he turned back toward me . " Actually , I do know a cure for black widow spider bites . "  | " Now you tell me . " " You got ta stand up first . " " Tom ? " " You want to get better or not ? " I stood , and as soon as I had , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you doing ? " I exclaimed when he was halfway down my front hall . He started up the staircase . " Guess . I got the afternoon off , in case you have n't noticed . " In my bedroom he set me down on the bed , then kissed my finger all the way around the bite . " Better yet ? " His smile was mischievous . " Why , I do believe I 'm feeling some improvement , Officer . " He kissed my wrist , my forearm , my elbow . A tickle of desire began at the back of my throat . It was all I could do to keep from laughing as we undressed each other , especially when my bandaged right hand made me fumble . I reached for the fleshy expanse of Schulz 's back . Only the night before , I had begun to discover hidden curves and niches there . Schulz 's warm body snuggled in next to mine . His hands lingered on my skin . Toni Schulz was the opposite of John Richard 's knobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , I wanted him to stay in my bed and never leave . " This is so great , " I murmured into his shoulder . " So you are feeling better . " " It 's a miracle . No more spider bite pain . You see , Officer , I planted the black widow ? " We went off into a fit of giggles . Then we fell silent . Schulz tucked the sheets and blanket around my neck and shoulders until not a square centimeter of cold , foreign air could penetrate the warm pouch within . Knowing that the boys were ( Inc home late , I allowed myself to drift off to sleep . My mother was probably right to be suspicious . It was nice , in fact it was deliciouc n he  | so successfully up to something with this man in my house in the middle of the day . The sun had already begun its blazing retreat behind the mountains when I woke to see Schulz standing beside my bed . My alarm clock said 5:30 . I said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You stay put . I 'm fixing dinner . " I got up anyway and took the doctor-ordered bath . As I was putting on clean clothes , trying in vain not to use my right hand , my phone rang . I dove for it , in case it was my mother . The last thing she needed was to hear Schulz 's voice again . " Goldy , you degenerate . " " Now what ? " " Oh , tell me that policeman 's car has been outside your house for three hours so he can teach you about security . " " Give me a break , Marla . I got bitten by a black widow . " " Old news . And I 'm sorry . That 's why I dfove by , four times . I was worried about you . Of course , I did n't want to interrupt anything exciting . . . . " " Okay , okay . Give me a little sympathy here . You would n't believe this bite I 've got . " " Giving you sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a whole lot more , sweetie pie . I am going to give you help tomorrow with whatever kind of catering things you 've got going . " " But you do n't even cook ! " Marla snorted . " After tomorrow , you 'll know why . " In the kitchen Schulz was playing country music on the radio and using a wok to steam vegetables . He had made a pasta dough that was resting , wrapped , on one of my counters , and he had grated two kinds of cheese and measured out cream and white wine . " Fettuccine Schulz , " he informed me as he jiggled the wok 's  | steamer tray . " How hard is it to make pasta in this machine ? That dough 's ready . " I put a pasta plate on my large mixer and Schulz rolled the dough into walnut-sized pieces . Just as the machine began producing golden ribbons of fettuccine , we heard the bays trudging up the porch steps . I felt a pang of sudden nervousness . " What 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out handfuls of pasta to dry . " You got bitten and I 'm helping out . They 're not going to say , Well , did you guys make love all afternoon ? If they do , I 'll say " ? he put his big hands around my waist and swung me around ? " yes , yes , yes , I 'm trying to force this woman to marry me by making mad passionate love to her at least once a day . " The door opened and I squealed at him in panic . He put me down lightly , looking unrepentant . I glanced around hastily for something to do . Julian and Arch rushed into the room , then stopped , gazing in silent awe at the masses of flowers . " Gosh , " murmured Julian , " bad news sure travels fast in this town . All this for a spider bite ? " I did n't answer . Arch was giving me half a hug with one arm while keeping his other hand free to hold up my bandaged area and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his tortoiseshell-framed glasses . " Are you okay ? " " Of course . " He closed one eye in appraisal . " But something 's going oil . Sure it was n't anything worse than a spider bite , Mom ? I mean , all these flowers . Are you sick ? " " Arch ! For heaven 's sake , I 'm fine . Go wash your hands and get ready for dinner . " Saved by the chore . To my surprise , they both sprinted out , calling back and forth about the work they were going to do together that night . Julian had volunteered to help Arch constru ( a model of the Dawn Treader . Then they were going to go over Arch 's social studies homework . After the moon set , they were going to look fin- the Milky Way . Amazing .  | When they came downstairs we all delved into the pasta . The velvety fettuccine was bathed in a rich cheese sauce studded with carrots , onions , broccoli , and luscious sun-dried tomatoes . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leftover Red ' n ' Whites , that Arch dropped his bombshell . " Oh , " he said without preliminaries . " I finally thought of something that someone warned me not to tattle about . " We all stopped talking , and held cookies in mid-bite . Arch looked at each of us with a rueful smile . He was a great one for dramatic effect . " Well , you know Mr. Schlichtmaier is kind of short and stocky ? He works out . I mean with weights . I 've seen him over at the rec center . " " Yes , " I said , impatient . " So ? " " Well , one day I asked him if he used steroids to pump himself up . " " Arch ! " I was shocked . " Why in the world would you do something like that ? " Schulz and Julian could n't help it ; they dropped their cookies and started laughing . " Well , I was thinking about starting to work out myself ! " Arch protested . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about guys dying because they use those hormones . And now you have to be checked before races and games ? " " Arch , " I said . It was not the first time I longed to throw a brick through the television . " What were you saying about tat-tling ? " " So Schlichtmaier goes , Steroids ? Ach ! Swear you wo n't tell ? ' " Arch 's mouth twisted . " He laughed , though . I thought , weird , man . Anyway , that was a couple of days ago . Then the next day he says , You wo n't tattle on me ? ' I say , No problem , Mr. Schlichtmaier , you want to die of cancer , that 's up to you . ' He says , You promise ? ' Boring , man . I say , Yeah , yeah , yeah . ' And then the snake thing happened and I forgot all about it . " Great . I looked at Schulz , who shrugged . Better to let go of it for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arch got  | up to clear the table . Julian offered to do the dishwashing . I walked out in the cool October night with Schulz . " Sounds like a joke , Miss G. , " he said , once again reading my mind . " Way to get a twelve-year-old kid to relax , have a relationship . Make a joke about artificial hormones . " " But you 're willing to suspect Audrey Coopersmith of murder based on the age of her truck . " He said , " You know we 're already checking on Schlichtmaier because of what you told us about the other gossip . If anything turns up , I 'll let you know . " When we arrived at the doors of his squad car , we did not kiss or hug . We did not act as if we were anything other than police officer and solid citizen . You never knew who might be looking . I felt happiness and sadness ; I felt the tug of a growing intimacy drawing me as ineluctably as the receding tide takes the unwary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and thanked him aloud for his help . He saluted me , then pulled slowly away from the curb . I ran back inside and picked up the phone with the thumb and little finger of my right hand , then dialed with my left . In the dining room I could hear the cheerful voices of the boys as they constructed their ship . " Aspen Meadow Recreation Center , " came the answer on the other end after six rings . " What time does the weight room open in the morning ? " I whispered . " Six . Why , you have n't been here before ? " " I 've been there , just not to the weight room . " " Y'have to have an instructor the first time , " said the voice , suddenly bored . " Okay , okay , put me down for an instructor , " I said quickly , then gave my name . A Hash of inspiration struck . " Does , uh , Egon Schlichtmaier teach over there , by any chance ? I know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nah , Egon does n't teach . Sometimes  | he 's here in the morning , brings a teenager . I asked if he knew Arnold Schwarzenegger , and he goes , He 's from Austria , ' like I was so dumb . " There was a pause . I could hear papers rustling . " I 'll put you down for Chuck Blaster . Twelve bucks . Wear sweats . " A dial tone . Oh , God . What had I done ? Chuck Blaster ? That could n't possibly be his professional name , could it ? But I replaced the receiver and crept up to bed . He who wants to be a tattler . . . I was not convinced it was a joke .  | The throbbing in my finger woke me up Wednesday morning just as the sunrise began to brighten the horizon . I was lying there , feeling exceedingly sorry for myself when the radio alarm blasted me six inches off the mattress . Blasted , yes . Not unlike Blaster , now part of my ruse for a confrontation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights with one hand virtually out of commission was not my idea of fun . It seemed the mattress was begging for my return . I ignored its siren call and slipped carefully into a gray sweatsuit , stretched through the yoga salute to the sun and five more asanas , and tried not to think about lifting anything . In the kitchen I wrote the boys a note . Gone to rec center wieght room . This would engender surprised looks , no doubt . My  | double espresso spurted merrily into a new Elk Park Prep carryalong mug , a heavy plastic container that the seventh-grade parents had been requested ( read " strong-armed " ) to purchase at the beginning of the school year as a fund-raiser for the kids ' trip to a self-esteem workshop in Denver . Afterward Arch informed me he was n't going to think positive unless he absolutely had to . And nobody can make me , he added . That 's what I should have said when it was mug-buying time . The grass underfoot was slick with frost , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . The van engine turned over with a purposeful roar . I ordered myself to think strong and muscular . Maybe I needed a positive . thinking workshop . The van chugged obediently over streets whitened by a thin sheet of ice . Aspen Meadow Lake appeared around a bend  --  a brilliant , perfectly still mirror of early light . The evergreens ringing the shore reflected inverted pines that looked like downwardpointing arrows trapped in glass . Early snows had stripped the nearby aspens and cottonwoods of their leaves . Skeletons of branches revealed the previous summer 's birds ' nests , now abandoned . Without the trees ' masking cloak of foliage , these deep , thick havens of twigs looked surprisingly , vulnerable . Like Keith Andrews . And so did our household seem vulnerable now too , with accidents or pranks that were becoming increasingly serious . Julian appeared to be coming apart at the seams . And I had been nastily injured trying to deal with the Stanford rep 's one and only visit to Elk Park Prep . As the caffeine fired up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Why was someone targeting Arch ? If indeed the spider in the drawer was intended for someone , was I that someone ? Without meaning to , I wrenched the wheel to the left and winced when pain shot up my finger . I 'd have to watch the bite area with the weights . Either that or risk passing out . The Mountain Journal 's too cute headline would read : CATERER A DUMBBELL ?  | An image of the dreaded simile-speaking headmaster invaded my thoughts . Perkins certainly had not been overeager to find the snake-hanger who plagued Arch . But in the minds of most , which was what Perkins was after all concerned with , he might be considered successful . In his decade at the school , Alfred Perkins had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for a muchpublicized classroom expansion and renovation . He had masterminded a building program that included an outdoor pool and gymnasium . During parent orientation , some of the friendlier parents  --  of which I had to admit there were some  --  informed me that Perkins had superbly weathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fired , and students being expelled . Still , it seemed to me that Alfred Perkins hid behind his great wall of similes without letting too many folks know what was truly transpiring in his silvery-haired noggin . Perhaps that was how he and Elk Park Preparatory School had survived together unscarred , if not unruffled , for ten years . Still , Perkins must view the past month as being unusually fraught with crises . First there was the splashy story in the Denver Post about the students ' slumping SAT scores . Then , if you believed Marla 's version of town gossip , there had been the threat of local newspaper coverage  --  by ambitious , clever Keith Andrews ? of a sex scandal . Or some kind of scandal . After the coverage the Post had given the SAT scores , what they would do with a **28;0;TOOLONG firebomb at the same school was barely imaginable . And then the most recent crisis , a whole order of magnitude more severe : the valedictorian had been killed -- murdered on school property . Whether Headmaster Alfred Perkins could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability and not-so-pristine reputation remained to be seen . I low heavily he was involved in , or even worried about , these setbacks was a question mark too . The word from Julian was that Perkins ' tall , center-forward son , Macguire , despite his poor third-quarter standing in the senior class , had a good chance at a basketball school North Caro-  | lina State , Indiana , UNLV . The acne-covered Perkins ' dull voice and drooping eyelids had been eerily impassive even in the face of the chaos surrounding his classmate 's brutal death . Macguire must be quite a disappointment to his status-seeking father , if not to himself . On the other hand , like many comics who acted the dunce , Macguire may have built up his own wall against caring . I swerved too late to avoid a muddy puddle , then began the ascent to the rec center parking lot . Built in the seventies , the Aspen Meadow Recreation Center was a long , low redbrick building on the hill behind the town 's public high school . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predated the athletic club and catered to a different local clientele  --  working-class folks . Anyone who had to labor for a living did n't have a prayer of an early morning workout at the infinitely tonier Aspen Meadow Athletic Club , which did n't even open its doors until ten . I pulled the van between the faded yellow lines of a space . To my astonishment , quite a few hardy souls were already parked in the rec center lot . Somehow , I had imagined I would be doing this body-building work in solitude . I devoutly hoped these fitness freaks were swimming laps . The thought that someone I knew might see me in sweats was more than I could bear . My shoes gritted over gravel sprinkled , with rock salt to melt the snow on the rec steps . Supported by an area-wide tax imposed by the residents themselves ( since Aspen Meadow was fiercely proud of its unincorporated status ) , the rec was a no-nonsense sort of place with an indoor pool ( shared with the public high school ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three racquetball courts . Here there were no steam rooms , no saunas , no massages , no tanning booths , no carpeted aerobics room , no outdoor pool . I did n't even know where the rec 's weight room was until the woman at the desk , who at the age of forty had decided she needed braces , told me . She took my twelve dollars and then , through a mouth crisscrossed with vicious-looking metal , announced that they 'd recently converted one of the racquetball courts .  | " Folks just want to lift weights , " she said with what I thought was too lingering a look at my lower-body bulges . I felt my heart sink with each step up to where people actually lifted heavy things because they thought it was good for them . I mean , these people wanted to be big , they wanted to gain bulk , and they did n't want to do it by eating fettuccine Alfredo and sour cream cheesecake ! They used powdered diet supplements ! What were they , nuts ? With some trepidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just smell bad , it smelled horrific . It was as if the walls had been painted with perma-sweat , guaranteed to stay wet . Sort of an unwashed rain-forest-in-the-gym concept . When I was about to pass out from the stench , a big guy ? I mean a really big guy  --  with lots of knots and bulges and popping-out muscles on his arms and chest and massive legs , sauntered up to me . He growled , " You Goldy ? " I swallowed and said , " Aah ? " His eyes , tiny sapphires set in an expanse of facial flesh , flicked over me contemptuously . " Do n't work out much , do you ? " Not a good start . I looked around at the different instruments of torture , things you pushed up on , things you pushed down on , things you watched your shoulders dislocate on in the bank of  --  yes ! ? mirrors . Men of all ages , and one woman who I at first thought was a man , were grunting and groaning and pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I improvised desperately , " I 'm just looking for somebody . . . . " " You 're looking for me , " said Big Guy . " Come on over here . I 'm Blaster . " Not one to argue with one so massive , I followed dutifully behind . I had a terrible blinding thought : What if I saw my exhusband here ? John Richard Korman would laugh himself silly . I cast a quick glance around . No Jerk . He preferred the more chichi athletic club . Thank ( god for tiny favors.  | " First we stretch , " announced Blaster . Well now , stretching was something I knew about . I said hopefully , " I do yoga . " Blaster did a prune face of disdain and thrust a long metal rod at me . He said , " Do what I do , " and then he threaded his huge arms around an identical metal rod . As he twisted his sculpted torso from side to side , I struggled to follow suit . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skewered on a shish kebab , so I stopped . Unfortunately I also let go . The , rod Blaster had given me clattered to the floor with an unhappy thunkety-thunk . " Hey ! " he bellowed . " Oh , do n't be too hard on her , " Hank Dawson said . " She had a really rough day yesterday . And she 's a big Bronco fan . " Unlike the young jocks in their scoopneck sleeveless shirts and tight black pants , Hank wore orange sweats emblazoned with the words DENVER BRONCOS  --  AFC CHAMPIONS ! " Finger okay ? " he inquired as he extricated himself from the thing he was pushing his elbows together in and walked slowly up to my tormentor and me . One thing I had noticed about how the men moved in the weight room : They swaggered around bowlegged , as if at any minute they were going to face off against , Gary Cooper . Tromp , tromp , tromp , do n't be too hard on her tromp tromp a rough day tromp , draw on three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning pained eyes up to Blaster , " I did suffer from a terrible spider bite yesterday . . . . " But Blaster had already clomped off to what looked like a stretcher lying on an angle . Hank Dawson gave me a grim apologetic look . " Are you sure you 're well enough to do this , Goldy ? I ) id you hear Elway pulled his shoulder in practice yesterday ? I 'm surprised you 're here . " I said feebly , " So am I. " He grinned . " You know they hate food people here . " " I 'm beginning to think this whole idea was a mistake . " I meant it .  | Blaster roared , " Hey , you , Goldy ! Get on this thing head down ! " Several men turned to see if I would do as commanded . I scurried over to Blaster . " You do n't seem to understand , I 've changed my mind . . . " He pointed at the stretcher . It was a long-fingered commanding point , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sistine ceiling . " Decline sit-ups , " he boomed . " You see , " I ventured tremulously , " there was this black widow . . . " The remorseless finger did n't waver . " Best thing for it . Get on . A man of few words . And so I started . First , sit-ups with my head lower than my feet on the stretcher , which seemed unfair . Why not at least be level ? Then incline leg raises and crunches ( sit-ups on a level surface  --  why bother when I 'd just defied gravity the other way ? ) , then more torso twists with the skewer rod , then leg presses , leg extensions , leg curls , bench presses , and front lat pulls . I 'm dying , I thought . No , wait  --  I 've died and I 'm in hell . In the mirror , my face was an unhealthy shade of puce . My finger throbbed . Rivulets of sweat ran down my forehead and turned into a veritable torrent inside my sweatshirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do better next time . Hey , Blaster ! There ai n't gon na be a next time . Finally , finally , Egon Schlichtmaier walked in with none other than Macguire Perkins . Why I had not made an appointment just to see Schlichtmaier at the school was beyond me . I was going to need a heating pad for a week . No , not a heating pad ? an electric sleeping bag and months of physical therapy . " I need to talk to you , " I panted when the two of them sauntered , John Wayne-like , over to where I was slumped on the floor , collapsed and terminally winded . Before they could greet me , however , Blaster loomed suddenly overhead . I was looking straight at his calves . Each resembled an oven-roasted turkey .  | Blaster 's beady blue eyes had a bone-chilling **32;30;TOOLONG look . " You 're not done . " His voice echoed off the dripping walls . " Oh , yes , I am , " I said as I scrambled to my feet , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a toothpick . I 'm as done as I 'll ever be . " But he was waving me over to the Stairmaster , unheeding . Egon Schlichtmaier said , " It 's not so easy the first time , " only it came out , " Id 's not zo easy ze furst time . " He gave me his big cow-eyed look . " Like sex , you know . " The muscles in his back and arms flexed and rolled as he escorted me over to the aerobics area . I hated him . I hated Egon Schlichtmaier for his muscles , I hated him for sleeping with those undergraduates , and I hated him for comparing what we were doing in this chamber of horrors to making love , which I had just begun to enjoy lately , thank you very much . Blaster was punching numbers into the Stairmaster 's digital readout with that meaty finger I had come to dread . He looked at me impassively . " Get on . Ten minutes . Then you 're through . " And joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scowled . " Better do what Blaster says , " came the unnaturally low voice of Macguire Perkins . " Guy has eyes in the back of his head . We 'll get on the treadmills and keep you company . " With such sympathetic exudings , the two of them mounted the treadmills and effortlessly began to walk . I wanted Macguire to go away , because what I was about to say concerned only Arch , Schlichtmaier , and me . Perhaps Macguire sensed my disapproval . le pulled out a headset while he was walking , tucked on earphones , and obligingly blissed out . I stepped off the Stairmaster . Let Blaster come over and bawl me out . I dared him . I crossed my arms in front of Egon Schlichtmaicr 's treadmill as Macguire Perkins began to screech along with his tape : " Roxanne ! "  | To Egon Schlichtmaier I said , " I understand you 've had some difficulty with my son . " Surprise flickered in his eyes . " I do not teach your son . " " Roxanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't want him to tattle about ? " I replied evenly . " He said you were teasing him about something he said . He said you teased him day after day , and it was about tattling on you for using steroids . I simply will not stand to have my son harassed , by you or anyone else . " I narrowed my eyes at him . And then I had a horrible thought : Maybe Arch was n't the only one Egon Schlichtmaier did n't want to have tattle on him . A chill of fear scuttled down my back . Damn . I should have left this whole thing to Schulz , as he was always telling me . Egon Schlichtmaier quietly turned off his treadmill and stepped off . He flexed his solid wall of muscles and I felt my heart freeze . Here I was among a bunch of bodybuilders , facing a possible multiple murderer . " Roxanne ! " screeched Macguire . His tall body rocked and heaved along the treadmill . His muscular chest shimmied to the beat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Yes , I did tease your son . But that was all it was . Your son has had a hard time fitting in socially at the school , as you may or may not be aware . " He crossed his arms : a standoff . " When he accused me of using steroids , which is no small accusation , as you know ? " Especially with all the other accusations you 're facing , I thought but did not say . " ? I tried to joke him out of it . I mean , I work out , but I 'm no Schwarzenegger , although we sound alike , no ? I think your son has been watching too much TV . " I really hate it when people criticize Arch . Egon Schlichtmaier put his hands on his hips . He was muscled , this was true , and superbly proportioned . Just because I did n't like him did n't mean lie could n't have an athlete 's body . But I had learned  | a few things about steroid use from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steroids cause mood swings . Egon Schlichtmaier may have been subject to these , who knew ? His reputed sex life certainly pointed to an abundance of testosterone . But he had none of the acne , no sign of the female-type breasts that chronic steroid-users frequently develop . Drug abuse . What was it that Hank Dawson had said to me at church the day after Keith 's murder ? I understand that kid 's had quite a history with substance abuse . The kid was the headmaster 's son . At the time , I had just ignored it ; no one else had seemed to think the rumor was worth looking into . And if the police suspected marijuana or cocaine deals were going down at the school , Schulz would have at least mentioned it . " Roxanne ! " bellowed Macguire Perkins joyously as he jounced along the treadmill . My eyes were drawn to him . Not just his face , but his entire body , was covered with acne . And he looked as if he could use at least a Maidenform 36C.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . " His license has been suspended for a year . Drunk driving . " Egon Schlichtmaier screwed his face into paternalistic incredulity . " I try to help these kids . I do not threaten them . " " Just trying to help , eh ? " I did n't mention the dalliances at C.U . Sometimes teachers did n't know their own power . One thing I did know about steroids was that a large percentage of students who took them got them from coaches and teachers . " Does Macguire have problems with other drugs ? I mean , that you know of . " " Sorry ? " Egon said as if he had not understood mc . " Like steroids , for instance ? "  | His shoulder muscles rippled in a shrug . " Have n't the foggi-est . " I peered hard at the darkly good-looking face of Egon Schlichtmaier . He was an oily sort of fellow  --  evasive , glib , hard to know . I said , " Because of Keith 's death , I 've been extremely concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this . . . threat to Arch . Do you know anyone who would want to hurt my son ? " " No one . " And then he added fiercely , " Including me . " " Okay . " I stalled . Perhaps I was overreacting . " I guess I misunderstood the tattling banter the two of you had . " Egon Schlichtmaier shrugged again . He closed his eyes and sighed as in , I 'll let it go this time . I tried to adopt a cheerful tone . " Think you 'll be staying at Elk Park Prep ? I mean , past this year ? " He pondered the question . " What makes you think I would not ? " I raised my eyebrows in ignorance . He seemed to accept that and shrugged again . " I have not decided . " At that moment a horrific shriek and reverberating metallic crash cut the air . On the other side of the room , a crowd gathered to see what had happened . A short , stocky fellow had dropped one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were involved , and if the barbell had landed on his toe . So much for clean and jerk . Blaster started yelling at the poor guy who 'd dropped the weight . Even Macguire pulled off his earphones . The Richterscale vibration had come through the treadmill . With an air of exasperated defeat , Egon Schlichtmaier hunched toward the melee . But it seemed to me the teacher was only too glad to leave me standing there ; we had n't exactly been having a pleasant conversation . Macguire slouched off after Egon . I noticed with delight that the preoccupied Blaster had his back turned to me . Time to boogie .  | I showered quickly and drove home . By the time I eased the van in behind the Range Rover it was almost eight A.M. The Range Rover ? Julian and Arch usually left for school around 7:30 . Panic welled up . Were they all right ? Had they overslept ? I bounded inside and up the stairs to check , and immediately regretted the move . My thighs screamed with pain from the workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their door , " Arch ! " There were groans and the sounds of shuffling sheets . The air in the room was close , and it smelled of boy . As an only child , Arch took rooming with Julian as a great adventure . It had begun with a bunk bed . Of course , I had n't been able to afford a new one , and we would n't be needing it after Julian went off to college . But a classified ad in the Mountain Journal had provided a secondhand two-tiered bed for fifty bucks . Unfortunately , it had cost another fifty for a carpenter to reinforce the upper bunk for Arch 's weight . " Guys ! " I said more loudly . I glanced around the room . Their school clothes lay in piles on a chair . A gel-filled ice pack was on the floor next to Arch 's slippers . " Is this a school holiday that I do n't know about ? " Julian lifted his head and barely opened puffy eyes . His unshaven , exhausted face was a mottled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gh ? Hnh ? " and then , " Oh , it 's you , " and flopped back on his pillow . " Hello ? " I tried again . " Arch ? " But Arch only pulled himself under his covers , a typical maneuver . I bent down to pick up his slippers . They were wet . " Julian , " I said with frustration , " could you wake up enough to tell me what is going on ? " With great effort Julian propped himself up on one elbow . He announced thickly , " Arch and I saw your note . Arch went outside to get the paper and slipped on the top porch step . I le landed on his ankle and really hurt himself . " Ile yawned . " I took  | a look , and since it had already begun to swell , I put some ice packs on it and told him to go back to bed until you could decide what to do . " Another , longer , yawn . " I did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He let out a deep , guttural groan , as if even putting this much thought into discourse were an effort . " Uh , Doctor Teller ? " I said . " After you diagnosed and treated the ankle , and sent the patient back to bed , what ? " He opened an eye . " Well , " he said with just a shade of a grin cracking the expanse of youthful brown beard , " since I knew you would n't want Arch to be here alone , I mean after the rock and the snake and all , I decided to stay home with him . I can afford to miss a day . " He flopped over . " You 'll have to be the one who calls the school , though . " Oh , what was the use ? " All right , okay , " I said . Respecting kids ' assessment of a situation is a finely tuned parenting skill . Not a skill I was sure I had yet , but never mind . " Arch ? May I please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assent and thrust the offending foot from underneath his covers . Julian 's makeshift ice pack had already begun to unwrap , but there were still two frozen gel-filled packs inside a gently knotted terry-cloth towel . The ankle was swollen all right . The skin around the ankle was a. pale blue . " From the steps ? " I was confused . " That 's awful . " Arch was not usually clumsy . In fact , his lack of athletic ability was in direct contrast to what I thought of as his physical grace , which of course you could see when he skied . Admittedly , as his mother I was somewhat prejudiced . " Can you stand on it ? " " I can stand on it and it is not broken , " said Arch . " One more thing , " muttered Julian , his head on the pillow , his eyes closed . " I do n't know if I 'm getting paranoid or something . Did you spill water out front ? " When I said that I had not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if someone had poured water over the steps . So anyone going out the front would fall and break his ass . " Hmm . In any event , medical attention was not warranted , at  | least for now . I backed out of the room , but not before I heard Arch 's muffled and indignant voice say : " I did not break my ass ! " I went down to the kitchen . When other people 's lives get chaotic , they smoke , they drink , they exercise , they shop . I cook . At the moment it seemed we all needed the comfort of homemade bread . I made a yeast starter and phoned Marla . " You said you were coming over to help me today , remember ? Please come now , " I begged to her husky greeting . " Goldy , it 's the middle of the night , for crying out loud . Or the middle of winter . I had a late date last night and I 'm hibernating . Call me when spring arrives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and it wo n't he winter for another seven weeks . Come on over and I 'll make something special . Julian and Arch are both home . Arch fell and Julian 's . . . tired . Besides , I want , you to tell me more about the lost teacher , Pamela Samuelson , and this Schlichtmaier fellow . " " The former has been hard to find , and the latter is too young for you . Is Arch okay ? " " Just bedridden . " She groaned . " Lucky him . I 'm so glad I 'm the one you call when the kids are incapacitated and you do n't have anything better to do . But if you 're making something special . . . . " " Doughnuts , " I promised . Marla was wild for them . She made a cooing noise and hung up . Within moments I realized I did n't have enough oil to fill even a quarter of a deep fryer . Well , necessity was the mother of all new recipes . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet but nutritious for the SAT breakfast that would follow Headmaster Perkins ' directive of including grains in everything possible . Why not oat bran in a doughnut ? I 'm sore kids would  | prefer that to an oat bran muffin any day , especially when those kind of muffins usually tasted as if they 'd come right out of a cement mixer . I moved the college financial aid books that Julian had left askew on the counter , then sanctimoniously sifted soy flour with the all-purpose stuff and , ever virtuous , poured judicious measures of oat bran and wheat germ on top . After the yeast starter was warm and bubbly , I swirled in sugar , eggs , vanilla , and the flour mixture . I massaged it into a rich , soft pillow of dough that snuggled easily into a buttered bowl . After I 'd put the whole thing into my proofing oven to rise , I put in a call to Schulz 's voice mail . I said I wanted to talk to him about Egon Schlichtmaier , who taught out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , and Audrey 's background ? As I hung up , Julian shambled in . He wore a T-shirt with the faded logo of some ancient rock concert , frayed jeans , and loafers with the backs crumpled down . " Sorry I was so tired , " he mumbled . He looked around the kitchen hopefully . " What 're you putting together ? You going to make some coffee ? " " Doughnuts in about an hour and a half , " I countered as I measured out Medaglia d'Oro and filled a pitcher with half-andhalf . " Cappuccino in a couple of moments . " He stood in front of my calendar of upcoming events and read what was coming : " Clergy lunch . . . Tattered Cover dessert . . . SAT breakfast . . . Bronco brunch . How do you figure out what to charge for these meals ? " Even when he was out of sorts , Julian had great enthusiasm for catering . He wanted to know everything . It provided a context for our relationship , for his goal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catering or restaurant business . Vegetarian , of course . While steaming the hot half-and-half for his cappuccino , I told him that the basic rule in catering was that you tripled the cost of your raw ingredients to include cooking , serving , and overhead . If clients wanted wine or any liquor , that was computed  | Galaxy Doughnuts 5 teaspoons ( 2 ' /4-ounce envelopes ) active dry yeast ' /3 cup warm water 21/4 cups plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/3 cup solid vegetable shortening , melted 1 ' /2 cups milk , scalded and cooled to lukewarm 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1/4 cup wheat germ 1/4 cup soy flour ' /4 cup oat bran 41/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 cup ( 2 sticks ) unsalted butter , melted In a large mixing bowl , sprinkle the yeast over the warm water . Allow the yeast to soften for 5 minutes , then stir the yeast into the water along with the ' /z teaspoon sugar . Set the mixture aside to proof for 10 minutes ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm milk , then add the liquid to the yeast mixture along with ' /4 cup of the remaining sugar , the salt , vanilla , eggs , wheat germ , soy flour , oat bran , and 11/2 cups of the flour . Beat vigorously until very well blended . Stir in the remaining flour and beat until smooth . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm , draft-free place until the dough is doubled in bulk , about 1 hour . Punch the dough down , turn it out on a wellfloured board , and pat it out so that the dough is about 1/2 inch thick . Using a star cookie cutter , cut out the dough and place the doughnuts 2 inches apart on buttered cookie sheets . Allow the doughnuts to rise uncovered for another 20 to 30 minutes or until they are doubled . Preheat the oven to 400 ? . Mix the remaining 2 cups sugar with the cinnamon . Bake the doughnuts for about 10 to 15 minutes or just until they are golden brown . Dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cinnamon sugar . Makes about 3 dozen .  | into the cost per person of the meal . I had sheets I gave to clients with the details of menus that were six to fifty dollars per person . " What if clients giving a party disagree on what they should get and how much things should cost ? " I laughed . " Do n't get me started on weddings this early in the morning . " " So tell me what you 're planning , " he asked as he sipped the cappuccino . We reviewed the menus and costs for the four upcoming events . He nodded and asked a question here and there . Then I asked how he was feeling about the college-application process . " Okay . " He stood to fix himself another , weaker cup of cappuccino . " I guess . " He obviously did not want to chat about the applications , though , so I let it drop . He reached for the sugar bowl , then plopped back down at the kitchen table . I managed not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second cup . Ah , well , perhaps I should be glad that it was n't drugs . Speaking of which . " Tell me about the headmaster 's son , " I began conversation-ally . " What 's there to tell ? " he asked between tiny slurps . " Is he taking steroids ? " Julian choked on the coffee . Sputtering and coughing , Ile wiped his chin with a napkin I handed him and gave me a dark look . " Gee , Goldy , let 's not mince any words . " " Well ? " Julian chewed the inside of his cheek . " You ca n't tell any-body , " he began quietly . " As if it were n't obvious . " Julian turned . " Macguire is under a lot of pressure . " " From whom ? " " Gosh , Goldy , from whom do you think ? I ) o I have to spell it out for you , like , like , uh " ? he cast his eyes heavenward in imitation of the headmaster ? " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son , I mean , is n't an academic type . He can hardly be expected to follow in his father 's footsteps . " Julian got up and carefully covered his cappuccino with waxed paper before placing it in the microwave . When the timer beeped , he took it out . Then he shook his head . " You 're not getting it . " " Okay , okay . Macguire excels in athletics . But that does n't mean he needs to do a dangerous drug , does it ? What happens if he gets caught ? " " He is n't going to get caught . Besides , he 's not selling anything , so what 's the penalty ? Everybody feels sorry for him . " He carefully sipped the heated cappuccino . Then he added darkly , " Almost everybody . " Wait a minute . " Was this what Keith Andrews was going to expose in the Mountain Journal ? " Julian , exasperated , snapped , " When are you going to believe that none of us knew what Keith was writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand through the blond mohawk . " That was the whole problem . I tried to get Keith to tell me what he was working on , and he said it would all come out . He made such a big deal about his secrecy , tapping away in the computer lab when no one was there . The CIA , man . " The front doorbell rang . I told Julian it was probably Marla , then cursed the fact that I 'd forgotten to sand the front steps . He said , " Oh , that reminds me , I forgot , you got a call ? " " Hold that thought . " Marla had safely navigated the steps and now stood in our doorway in her usual seasonal colors . This morning , three days before Halloween , the outfit consisted of an extra-large orange and black suede patchwork skirt and matching jacket . She held a brown grocery sack . You did n't have to bring anything , " I said . " Do n't presume , " she announced haughtily as her plump body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue gun , Styrofoam cone ,  | and bag of baby Three Musketeers for Arch . Even sick people can do a craft project with candy . Especially sick people . And by the way , your front porch steps are covered with ice . Absolutely treacherous . Better put some salt on them . " So saying , she dropped the bag at the bottom of the stairs , then yodeled a greeting to Julian , whom she passed on her way into the kitchen . " You see , about this call ? " Julian attempted . " Just a sec . " I turned back to slam the front door against the cold . Before I could close it , though , a small foreign car arrived on the street directly in front of my house . A young woman whom I vaguely recognized as being from the Mountain Journal delicately stepped out and peered up at me . Julian came up beside me . " This is it , I 'm sorry I forgot to tell you . This woman called from the newspaper around 6:45 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interview you this morning . I thought you 'd want it for free publicity . For the business . It was n't until I was about to hang up that she said it was about that night out at the headmaster 's house . " He added lamely , " I 'm really sorry . " " Just take care of Marla , will you ? " I said under my breath . " And check the doughnut dough . " Then I shouted gaily to the intruder , " Come on in ! " as if I were accustomed to having open house at nine o'clock every morning . " Just avoid the ice on the steps . " After lifting weights , the last thing I needed was to lug a bag of road salt up from the basement to make my steps safe fir the world of journalism . The reporter tiptoed gingerly up the far side of my front steps . Frances Markasian was in her early twenties , wore no makeup , and had straggly black hair that fell limply to the shoulders of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right arm and banged against the knees of her tight jeans . " You do n't have a camera in there , ( 10 you ? " I asked once she was safely inside . I could n't hear the thought of photographs .  | " I wo n't use it if you do n't want me to . " Her voice was pure Chicago . " Well , I 'd really rather you would n't , " I said sweetly , leading her out to the kitchen . Marla was already sipping cappuccino that Julian had made for her . Frances Markasian was introduced all around , and I asked her if it was okay if my friends stayed while she talked to me . She shrugged , which I took as consent . I offered her some coffee . " No thanks . " She dipped into her bag , brought out a diet Pepsi , popped the top , and then dropped two Vivarin through the opening . Marla watched her , open-mouthed . When Frances Markasian took a long swig from the can , Marla said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . " Frances ignored her and pulled a pen and pad out of the voluminous bag . " I understand you were the caterer the night of the Andrews murder ? " " Well , er , yes . " I had a sinking feeling she was not going to be asking about the menu . Julian must have felt the reporter 's eyes on him , because he got up , punched down the risen dough , and began to roll it out to cut doughnuts with a star cookie cutter . " You want to tell me what happened ? " she said . " Well . . . " I began , then gave her the briefest possible account of the evening 's events . Her pen made scritching noises as she took notes . " They 've been having some other problems out at that school , " she said when I had finished and was checking on the doughnuts , which had almost finished their brief rising . " Really ? " I inquired innocently . " Like what ? " I was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain Journal had been negative . They 'd hired a food critic , who had viciously trashed me . The critic had been conducting a private vendetta in print . By the time I got the mess exposed , the  | unapologetic Mountain Journal had moved on to reports of elk herds moving through mountain neighborhoods . " Problems like snakes in lockers , " Frances said . I waved my hand dismissively . " Seventh grade . " " Problems like a headmaster who might be having trouble raising money if bad news got out about the school , " Frances continued matter-of-factly . " Take this dropping-SAT-score thing ? " " Oh , Ms. Markasian , sweetheart , " Marla interrupted , " that news is so old , it has mold on it . Besides , if you were worried about your academic reputation , you would n't kill your top student , now , would you ? " Marla rolled her eyes at me . " Those goodies ready ? " I turned to Julian , who wordlessly slid the risen doughnuts into the heated oven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about that headmaster ? " Frances persisted . She tapped her pen on the pad . " I know as much as you do , " I told her . " Why do n't you tell us about the story Keith Andrews was working on for your pa-per ? " " We did n't know what it was , " she protested , " although he had been working on it for some time , and he 'd promised something big . " She tilted her Pepsi can back to drain the last few drops . " We were going to read it when he was done and then decide whether to run it or not . If it was a timely story . You know , truthful . " " You have such a good reputation for fact-checking , " I said with a lying smile . Without a shred of self-consciousness she tossed her can across the room into one of the two trash bags resting against my back door . Arch was supposed to take them out , but he was incapacitated . " Three points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I retrieved the can and dropped it into the aluminum bin in the pantry . I hoped  | she would take the hint and decide it was time to wrap things up . But no . " How about the headmaster 's son ? Macguire Perkins ? He drove his father 's car through a guard rail on Highway 203 over the summer . Blood alcohol level 2.0 . " I shrugged . " You know as much as I do . " Frances Markasian looked around my kitchen , her shallow black eyes impassive . The smell of the baking doughnuts was excruciating . I had n't realized how hungry I was . " I understand some of the Elk Park Prep students and parents are pretty competitive . Would do anything to get into the right college . " I crossed my arms . " Yeah ? Like what ? " She tapped her mouth with her pen but gave no answer . " Keith Andrews was the valedictorian . Who was next in line ? " Before I could answer , Arch came limping into the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join him out in the living room to make a sculpture out of the Three Musketeers . " Wow , " said Arch . " At nine-fifteen in the morning ? " " We 're going to build a fire too . Is that all right ? It is kind of cold . " When I gave him the go-ahead , he said , " Can you handle getting the doughnuts out of the oven ? " " She 's an old pro at removing cookie sheets , " said Marla . " Besides , I think Ms. Markasian is almost done , is n't she ? " Frances Markasian closed her eyes and said , " Huh . " She rounded her back and stretched her arms out in front of her . Journalistic meditation . The buzzer went off and I took the doughnuts out . Julian had prepared a pan of melted butter and a mountain of cinnamon sugar , so I quickly dipped and rolled , ( lipped and rolled . I brought the first plate of plump , warm doughnuts over to the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkled on the veil of melted butter . Marla delicately lifted one onto a plate and then took a huge bite . " Please have one , " I said to the reporter .  | She shook her head . Frances Markasian seemed to be unable to decide whether to share something with me . After a moment she put her pen and pad away in her enormous purse . " I 'll tell you like what parents will do . Last week we got a call at the paper saying we should run a story on how Stan and Rhoda Marensky had sent a full-length mink coat to the director of admissions at Williams . " I could n't help it . My mouth fell open . " Listen , " said Marla in her one-upsmanship voice . She reached for her second doughnut . " I would n't spend a winter in Massachusetts if I had a mink house . " At that moment , yells erupted from the living room . Julian banged through the kitchen door . A cloud of smoke billowed in behind him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flue 's open but the smoke wo n't go up ! I 'll help Arch out the front . You all need to get out ! " His face was white with fear . " Out the front , hurry ! " I yelled at Marla and Frances . We bolted . Julian and Arch were already halfway down the front walk by the time we three adults came hustling through the front door . Julian had Arch 's arm draped around his shoulder and the two were half skipping toward the street . Frances Markasian reached the sidewalk first . With frighteningly effortless ease she spun around and scooped her camera out of her big black bag . Then she hoisted it and took a picture of Marla , midair , grasping a freshly baked oat bran doughnut , as she slipped on the iced steps and broke her leg .  | With sirens blaring and lights flashing , the fluorescent chartreuse AMFD trucks arrived in a matter of moments , proving the local adage that the fastest thing about our town was the fire department . One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian had hastily opened , and she 'd put in the call . Over the incessant buzz of the smoke alarm , I screamed to Julian to stay out in the street with Arch . A wad of fur hit my calves and was gone  --  Scout the cat making a streaking escape . Flames were consuming my home . But I refused to leave Marla 's side at the bottom of the front steps . Firemen clumped by us into the house . Marla clenched my hand and sobbed copiously . My schooling in Met ! Wives 10I adjudged it to he a broken right tibia . I shrieked for somebody to call an ambulance .  | The firefighters rapidly assessed the situation and put a ladder up to the roof . Minutes later , clad in schoolbus-yellow protective gear , the first fellow descended the ladder , holding a blackened piece of plywood and shaking his head . With a screaming siren , the ambulance arrived and carted Marla off to a Denver hospital . I hugged her carefully and promised to visit just as soon as the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that everyone could know what had happened . Marla 's idea of hell is enduring pain alone . " What was that board ? " I demanded of the one volunteer firefighter I recognized , a gray-haired real estate agent who had originally sold the house to John Richard and me . " You had something on top of your chimney . " " Well , yes , but . . . how did it get there ? " " You have some gutter or roof work done ? This your first use of the fireplace this season ? " " It is not my first use of the fireplace this season , and the only work I 've had done on the hour- recently was a security system I had put in this summer . " The blackened board lay propped against one of the tires of the AMFD truck . Two firemen stood in front of it , deep in conversation . " Look , Goldy , it could have been a lot worse . We had this same thing happen to a summerhouse over by the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much paper on the logs , the chimney needs to be swept , or some birds have built a nest . Anyway , our guys went up . First one took off a nest , sure enough . Then he looked down the chimney and fainted . Second guy looked down the chimney and fainted . I had smoke , flames , and two guys out cold on the roof . Had to call an ambulance 6 ) r the firefighters . Turns out this burglar had tried to enter the house through the chimney , got stuck , died of asphyxiation . 1 n t he . spring some birds built a nest . Then the owners came hack and built a fire . Once our guys pulled out that nest , they looked down at a perfectly preserved skeleton . "  | I clenched my head with both hands . " Is this story supposed to reassure me ? " He shrugged one shoulder and moved off to help his men reload their equipment . The emergency , as far as they were concerned , was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on . I asked if anyone had seen a person or persons on my roof recently . All negative . Then I crossed over to the house of a young mother , the only person on our street who had a good view of my place . Her forehead furrowed as she fixed the shoelace of one child and then gave antibiotic to another . She was raising four children under the age of six , and whenever anyone stupidly asked if she worked , she threw a dirty diaper at them . She told me she 'd been preoccupied ferrying her kids to the pediatrician  --  three times in the last week  --  and no , she had n't seen anyone . Julian announced that he and Arch had decided they might as well go to school , was I going to be all right ? I told them to go ahead . Frances Markasian stood on the sidewalk , snapping photos , as if the fire were the biggest news event to hit Aspen Meadow this century . The crash of the Hindenburg had less photo coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her . " I thought you promised not to do that . " My life was beginning to feel out of control . " Before , you were n't news , " she said impassively . " Now you 're news . Any idea how this could have happened ? " " Zero , " I mumbled . " Did you see that plywood board they took off the chimney ? " She nodded . " Maybe some workmen left it over the summer . I wish you would n't publish those pictures . People will think I burned something in my kitchen . " " If something more exciting happens before Monday , no problem . " She shoved the camera into her bag and drew out a cigarette . No breakfast , diet cola with caffeine tabs , and now a smoke . I would give this woman ten years . She inhaled hungrily . " Listen , you were pretty discreet in there about the competition situation out at F.Ik Park Prep . So was I. But you 're wrong . "  | " Oh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well . " Fran blew a set of perfect smoke rings . " Parents seem to think we have an endless amount of newspaper space to run articles about their kids . First we did an article about Keith Andrews in September , at his request . " She tapped the cigarette , scattering ashes on her denim jacket . " Maybe you saw it : Firstplace Andrews blends academics with activism . ' I mean , Keith helped us a lot during the summer covering the Mountain Rendezvous and the arts festival , so we figured we owed him the article when he asked . Anyway . We ran the piece and Stan Marensky called us , shrieking his head off . Said Keith Andrews had never marched in front of his store the way he claimed . Said the kid did n't know a mink from an otter and could n't care less about the anti-fur movement . So we went back and asked Keith about it , and he confessed that he had used a wee bit of exaggeration , but that the profile was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another batch of white 0 's . " If only you all would check facts before you print things , " I murmured . She flicked ashes . " Hey , what do you think we are , The New York Times ? This was supposed to be a human interest thing . Then Hank Dawson shows up on our doorstep , waving a copy of the newspaper . He figures we should run a full-page profile on his daughter for our Who 's Who ' section . When we say his daughter is n't anybody special , Dawson yells he 's going to withdraw all of his cafe advertising . We say , well , he can buy a page of advertising for his daughter , and he stomps out . Then he cancels both his advertising and his subscription . " The " Who 's Who " page usually ran stories of veterinarians saving elk calves and national celebrities showing up at local Fourth of July celebrations . If we were n't talking the Times , we were n't exactly talking People , either . " Perhaps you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't read the Mountain Journal " ? she crushed the cigarette savagely beneath her toe ? " because we did . In Mountain Arts and Crafts ' there was an article on little Greer Dawson and the Bronco jewelry she was making to peddle at her parents ' cafe . Earrings dangling with miniature plastic orange footballs . Necklaces made of rows of teensy-weensy football hel-mets . " Frances groped in the bulging bag and brought out a packet of candy corn . Dessert . She offered me some ; I declined . " Now , how many women do you think actually buy jewelry like that ? That article proved every stupid stereotype people have of rural journalism . We got the cafe 's advertising back , but it was still a mistake because who comes in the next week ? Audrey Coopersmith , whining that we should run an article on Heather and how her scientific know-how saved the ice cream social at the Mountain Rendezvous ? " " How do you save an ice cream social ? " She finished the candy corn and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , they have such a small power source in the homestead next to the park where the Rendezvous is held . " I did n't , but I nodded anyway . " The freezer holding the HaagenDazs blew the fuses , and Heather Coopersmith saved the day by rewiring the whole thing . . . we are talking way boring . We did n't run an article for Audrey Coopersmith , and she cancelled her subscription . So what . I have to go . Sorry about your chim-ney . " And with that she climbed into her car and discarded the candy corn bag out the window . She lit up another cigarette , revved the engine , and chugged away . I picked up the bag from the street and went back into the house . The smoke alarm had stopped its ear-splitting buzz . I opened all the windows . After the commotion , the place felt absurdly quiet ; it smelled like a camping site . I jumped when the phone rang  --  Tom Schulz . I told him what had happened , ending with poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney ? " he wanted to know .  | " That was my question . Think I should get the security people to come back out here ? " " I think you should move out of your house for a while . Go to Marla 's , maybe ? " His voice was slow and serious . " No can do , sorry to say . Her cabinets would never pass the county health inspector . Anyway , whoever is doing this seems to know I have a security system , so I 'm safe except for pranks . " He asked where the boys were , and I told him . " Listen , Goldy , I do n't care about your system . I do n't want you in that place alone , especially at night . " I ignored this . " Thanks for the worry . Now , I 've got a question for you . What was the story on the fuses at the headmaster 's house ? I mean , when the fuses blew that night , that was the moment that Keith Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There was a timer attached to one set of wires that had been stripped and coiled together . It was planned , sure , but you knew that , did n't you ? " I told him about the Rendezvous and Heather Coopersmith 's expert knowledge of wiring . " It 's a long shot , " he said , " but I 'll go question her again . What 's your take on that kid and her mother , anyway ? " " Oh , I do n't know . " My head ached , my finger throbbed , and I did n't want to go into the details of Audrey 's bitterness , or how long it seemed to be lasting . " Audrey 's unhappy , you saw that . Did the headmaster 's place turn up anything else ? I saw your guys out there sweeping the place after the snow melted . " " It did , as a matter of fact . Makes your discovery of the credit card in Rhoda Marensky 's coat somewhat more interesting . Out by the sled there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , my God . " " Problem is , Stan Marensky says the pen could have cone from anywhere , and Rhoda Marensky swears she did n't leave her coat out at the headmaster 's house . "  | " Liar , liar , raccoon on fire . Mr. Perkins specifically told me she 'd be so happy to get it back . " " Headmaster Perkins said the coat just appeared in his closet the day of the dinner and he called Rhoda , who then forgot to take it with her after the lights went out . But she had been missing it for a couple of weeks . She says . " " If that is true , then whoever is doing all this is a phenomenally elaborate planner . " I thought for a minute , and remembered only a glimpse of a fur-clad Stan Marensky whisking Rhoda out the headmaster 's front door after the lights had come back on and order had been restored . " Look , I do n't know what 's going on with the Marenskys , their store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand is why me ? Why a rock through my window , why ice on my steps , why a board over my chimney ? I do n't know anything . I never even met Keith Andrews . " " I swear , I wish you 'd come to my place for a while , Miss G. Or more than a while , if you 're still of a mind . . . " " Thank you , but I 'm staying put . " " You 're in danger . I 'm going to talk to the team here about setting up some surveillance ? " I let out a deep breath . He said , " I 'll get back to you . " As usual , cooking cleared the head and calmed the nerves . I needed both . First I froze the doughnuts , which , miraculously , were n't smoke-damaged . Then I set about planning cooking times for the priests ' luncheon on Friday , the Tattered Cover affair on Halloween night , and the SAT breakfast on Saturday morning . I called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus fresh fruit . The rest of that day and the next passed placidly enough . I picked Marla up from the hospital Thursday morning and took  | her back to her house . She did n't want me to baby her . With all her money , Marla could pick anyone she wanted to take care of her ; she had opted for a private nurse , arranged while she was still in the hospital . Arch 's ankle healed nicely and gave him the much-desired excuse from gym class . He announced brightly that he was resting so he 'd be completely better for skiing over the weekend . Julian sprinkled road salt on the iced front steps before the supplier arrived with her crates of boxes . I tried to believe that the board-over-the-chimney person had not also been responsible for the ice hazard . But that was sure to be wishful thinking . Miss Ferrell called on Thursday afternoon and said she wanted to go over Julian 's list for colleges with me after the SATs on Saturday , instead of our planned chat beforehand . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she wanted to give me her full attention . I was n't one of his parents , but she wanted to feel that some responsible adult was involved . " Julian can come too , if you like , " she added . But I said I would feel better if she and I could just have a little time together alone . After all , I was new at this . Friday morning brought gloomy clouds spitting snowflakes . Because his father was picking him up at three to go directly to Keystone , Arch busied himself packing up his ski gear before school . I washed crisp spinach leaves and poached sole fillets in white wine and broth . Then I chopped mountains of cranberries and pecans for the Sorry Cake . When I was putting the cake pans into the oven , Julian said he 'd had an invitation to spend the night at a friend 's house ; they would go to the bookstore talk and the SAT testing together . But he was concerned  --  would I be all right alone ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him if ' I could survive all those years with John Richard Korman , I could survive anything . Besides , with both boys gone , I knew just what guest to call . I gave the boys pumpkin muffins for breakfast and helped Arch lug his skis , hoots , and poles out to the Range Rover . Saying  | good-bye to him before he went off with his father was always difficult ; before a holiday , even Halloween , it was excruciating . At the last minute , Arch dashed upstairs to get his highpowered binoculars . " Almost forgot ! I might be able to see the Andromeda galaxy once they turn out the night-skiing lights . You can see Andromeda in the winter , but never in the summer ! " he hollered over his shoulder . When the boys were finally ready , I sent them off over their halfhearted protests with homemade popcorn balls and packets of candy corn to share with their friends . They took off in a mood of high good cheer . Halloween was not a school holiday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Arch 's cone sculpture of Three Musketeers bars made the two boys laugh giddily after a week that had been grueling for us all . Despite his upbeat mood as he drove off , Julian 's taut face and bitten nails told another story . During the past two weeks , he had spent hours at the kitchen table , studying financial aid forms and making lists of numbers . When he was n't doing homework , he pored over tomes on test-taking and SAT review . Along with the rest of his class , Julian had taken the PSATs his sophomore year and the SATs his junior year . But this third time was it , he told me , the big one , make or break , do or die . These were the scores the colleges looked at to make their decisions . I had tried to drill him a little bit Thursday night , using the SAT review , but it had not been a pleasant task . I mean , who made up these tests ? For example , one analogy asked , handsome is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ugly , attractive , or dead ? Well , did n't that depend on whether or not you thought corpulence is an attractive trait ? I happened to think that it was , and argued to that effect . And when , I demanded , were you going to use the word epigrammatic in day-to-day conversation ? Now , I am all for reading and vocabulary-building , but as our generation used to say , let 's get relevant . I told Julian he did n't need to know that one . He sighed . What did me in , though , was My friend is
