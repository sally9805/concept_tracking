Section : INTERNATIONAL Fake pharmaceuticals look like the real thing  --  but they can be lethal <p> In Nigeria last month , authorities learned that 109 children had died of kidney failure after ingesting an industrial solvent ; hospitals mixed it into syrup in the belief it was a pharmaceutical chemical made in the Netherlands . In Mexico , officials confiscated 15,000 counterfeit burn remedies ; many contained sawdust , coffee or dirt and caused raging infections . In Burma , scores of villagers may have perished after taking worthless copies of a drug meant to combat malarial fever . In Europe , hospitals and pharmacies handed out millions of pirate doses of a cardiac medicine , some at only half the purported strength . ( There were no known casualties . ) In the United States , the emergence of a $100 million black market in anabolic steroids has spurred drug counterfeiting despite a congressional crackdown in 1988 . <p> Over the last decade , the profits to be made in the $150 billion pharmaceutical market have inspired a new form of forgery : drugs that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They include Zantac , the world 's best-selling ulcer drug ; Selokeen , a hospital-administered cardiac beta-blocker ; Adriamicin , for leukemia victims ; Fansidar , used against malaria . The counterfeits look like the real thing , right down to the labels , manufacturers ' pamphlets and purity seals . <p> In Africa , fakery is epidemic : Nigerian pharmacists estimate that more than a quarter of the roughly 4,000 different medicines on the market are phony . One lot , sold as an antibiotic , was " nothing but talcum powder  --  perfume and all , " says Nigerian Health Minister Olikoye Ransome Kuti . The estimated cost to legitimate manufacturers : $1.9 billion a year in theft of the " intellectual property " of U.S. firms worldwide ; $16.2 million in America alone from counterfeiting . The human cost is incalculable . " Hundreds if not thousands of people have died , " says Susan Foster , a health economist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine . " This is a really nasty business . " <p> Who are the counterfeiters ? They range from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Argentina and Greece . The chemicals they need are freely available on the open market ( chart ) . Often the point of origin is a nation that does not recognize international drug patents  --  India , for example , or Thailand . From there a finished drug or its basic chemical components may be shipped anywhere through a series of cut-rate brokers who function as middlemen . " The trail for a drug found in Britain may be Brazil , Chile , Argentina , Spain , Italy , " said Paul Carratu , whose London investigative firm currently has 60 counterfeiting cases . " The brokers have never checked the goods . Let 's say they do n't want to know . " <p> The problem is one the multinational drug companies are reluctant to acknowledge . It 's " like asking someone how his wife is in bed , " says an attorney for a big U.S. drug firm . The companies spend millions fighting the counterfeiters . But nearly all the big manufacturers deny that it 's even an issue . " We would not dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy our product , " says Jeffrey Foote , an attorney who recently retired from Britain 's Wellcome Foundation , a leading drug manufacturer . <p> Drug piracy has hit the poorest nations like a plague . " If the counterfeiters would confine themselves to fake diarrhea pills or cough syrup , that would be one thing , " says Foster . " But it 's fake antibiotics , antivirals , insulin  --  and these are drugs the lack of which can mean life or death , especially for young children . " In the case of the 109 deaths in Nigeria , a wholesale pharmacist simply bought an unmarked drum supposedly containing the preservative propylene glycol , a chemical used in paracetamal syrup . In fact it held diethylene glycol  --  used in antifreeze . The pharmacist bottled the poison , affixed a phony label and sold it to unwitting hospitals . <p> Contaminated water : Most developing countries are ill equipped to fight back . " These governments have a hard enough time monitoring the legitimate laboratories , so how are they going to keep an eye on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican Association for Consumer Defense . Fake antibiotics seem to be nearly as prevalent as the bootleg burn remedies confiscated in 1988 , Lomeli says . Authorities discovered one lab in Hidalgo state , north of the capital , that was diluting a bootleg drug with contaminated water , packaging it and selling it as Lincocin , an antibiotic marketed by Upjohn of Mexico . <p> Huge potential profits have made Europe and the United States targets , too . Patent protection allows drug manufacturers to set their own prices , which necessarily reflect big development costs . Add marketing expenses , a sizable profit , and the result can be a gap of almost 2,000 percent between the cost of counterfeiting a pill and the legitimate drug 's price at the pharmacy . <p> Counterfeiting has been uncovered throughout Europe . In the Netherlands , officials recently discovered counterfeits of Selokeen , Adriamicin and Zantac . In the Dutch Zantac case , the Amsterdam distributor Pharmacis bought the bogus pills through a Swiss drug-brokerage firm called Rodion , which said it bought the Zantac from a reputable Greek wholesaler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had bought the raw materials from Turkey or Singapore . Chemically , the fakes were almost perfect . The counterfeit Selokeen followed a similar route , according to the Swedish manufacturer , Astra . It discovered the fake when the company surveyed its products in the Dutch market and an Astra chemist noticed that the trademark imprint on some tablets looked odd . Some of the pills , it turned out , were only half strength . Again , Pharmacis bought the pills from Rodion , which got them from a factory near Milan . Dutch authorities are investigating the deal . " We have been drawn into bad situations beyond our control . " Rodion director Mikail Segui told NEWSWEEK . <p> In France , a judge is investigating allegations that a French firm counterfeited the leukemia drug Adriamicin and marketed it in France , Belgium and the Netherlands . A U.S. importer spotted the fake . Germany reported finding counterfeit Euglucon , an antidiabetic pill . A consignment of Ventolin , an anti-asthma inhaler , was intercepted at London 's Heathrow Airport last year . Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has discovered four counterfeits of its products in the last 18 months . " In all honesty , I just can not tell you if the next time we pick up a packet of Zantac from the pharmacy down the road , it will contain nothing , something potentially very serious to someone with a recurring ulcer , or if it will contain arsenic , " said Glaxo managing director Michael Bailey . <p> Records sealed : Italy may be the world headquarters of pill piracy . Carratu said 80 percent of the fake drugs his company has investigated came from Italy , which before 1978 did not honor international drug patents . In 1987 , a reporter from the Sunday Times of London posed as a pharmaceutical dealer to investigate an Italian firm which he said specialized in " producing copies of well-known drugs for Third World countries . " The Times tested one drug and found it contained only half the stated amount of the active ingredient . But Italian officials say they found nothing to prosecute . The tablets were being exported in bulk and packaged abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mislabeled , says Romano Capasso of the Italian Ministry of Health 's pharmaceutical division . Prosecution has proven difficult . For one thing , many drug companies settle cases against counterfeiters out of court  --  then get the court records sealed  --  in order to avoid publicity . And among Italian officials , " there just does n't seem to be any drive to prosecute people with fraud , " said Eric Ellen , head of the International Chamber of Commerce . <p> What to do ? British manufacturers want mandatory batch testing of imports and strict licensing requirements for dealers . Carratu once surveyed 100 drug-brokerage houses to see how many would sell to a firm with an impressive letterhead but no license ; 20 agreed . But importers say testing is too expensive . Glaxo 's Dutch and British subsidiaries have begun selling Zantac with a harder-to-copy hologram on the packet . Hoffmann-LaRoche brings out new pills in unusual shapes  --  oblongs or V 's  --  to discourage counterfeiters . <p> In the Third World , prospects are bleak . The World Health Organization is strengthening its reporting requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drug being exported is a legitimate , licensed firm . But the certificates are often faked . WHO has warned governments about the problem and issued dockside testing manuals for customs officials that can help them tell whether a drug contains any active ingredients . Governments are concerned that " the counterfeit situation is getting completely out of hand , " says John Dunne , WHO 's director of drug management . Recognizing the problem is at least a first step . <p> MAP:The Tale of the Trail <p> A recently discovered batch of counterfeit Zantac , the world 's best-selling ulcer drug , followed a typical trail : ( 1 ) The raw ingredients probably came from either Turkey or Singapore , according to Zantac 's manufacturer . ( 2 ) In Greece , a counterfeit pressed the tablets , packed them with fake labels and through a wholesaler ( 3 ) sold them to a Swiss pharmaceuticals brokerage. ( 4 ) The Swiss firm then sold the fake Zantac to an Amsterdam distributor called Pharmasis . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ill equipped : Open market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad medicine : Counterfeit drugs seized by U.S. lawmen <p> BY TOM MASLAND AND RUTH MARSHALL <p> Additional reporting by JEFFREY BARTHOLET in Lagos , RON MOREAU in Bangkok and TIM PADCETT in Mexico City <p> CONFESSIONS OF A COUNTERFEITER <p> Javid Naghdi has traded his business suits for an orange prison jumpsuit and blue sneakers . But he retains the con man 's pitch that brought him notoriety in the U.S. Justice Department as " the most dangerous prescription-drug counterfeiter known to the FDA . " He admits that he used his pharmacy training to put fake arthritis pills on the U.S. market . His excuse ? Others do it , he said last week in the U.S. Penitentiary at Atlanta , where he is serving a 14-year sentence that began in May . " Half the drugs in this country are counterfeit , " he said , a claim experts reject as nonsense . <p> Pharmacists are used to trading illegally in manufacturers ' samples , said Naghdi , 30 . The California wholesalers who bought fake Naprosyn that he passed off as overstock in 1987 " knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering evidence . He complained about drug firms ' profits . " Do you know how much it costs to make a bottle of the ulcer drug Tagamet ? " he demanded . " Less than a dollar , and they sell it for over $50 . " Absurd , says the manufacturer . <p> Naghdi 's 1,201 bottles of fake Naprosyn brought $192,680 on expenses of $21,185 for readily available pill-pressing equipment , bulk supplies and printing . They contained mainly aspirin . They could have killed patients with ulcers or allergies who unwittingly took them . They looked perfect  --  right down to the bar code that pharmacists scan electronically to verify a drug 's authenticity . They reached dealers and drugstores from Carrolton , Texas , to Seattle . A California pharmacist sounded the alarm ; the pills smelled wrong . <p> After he was caught , Naghdi jumped bail and set-up in London . The U.S. Customs Service trapped him in an elaborate sting operation when he offered brokers 9 million bottles of three best-selling drugs : Tagamet , Naprosyn and the antibiotic Anspor . Naghdi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. counterfeiting case , when more than a million spurious birth-control pills were smuggled in through Panama between 1981 and 1984 . Counterfeiting is " a growing problem that people do n't recognize , " said Phillip Halpern , the U.S. prosecutor in San Diego who convicted Naghdi . " The ease with which Naghdi was able to obtain his raw materials is frightening . " Are more Naghdis still at large ? " Certainly there are , " he said . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cautionary tale : Naghdi <p> By TOM MASLAND with VERN E. SMITH in Atlanta JOHN TALIAFERRO in San Diego <p>
