H. Wayne Huizenga is not too proud to admit he comes from trash . The chairman of Blockbuster Entertainment , which operates the world 's largest chain of home-video stores , got started in business as a private hauler , collecting garbage from 2 a.m. until noon in Pompano Beach , Florida . After showering and changing clothes , he spent the rest of the day hunting up new customers . The eventual result : Waste Management , now called WMX Technologies , the world 's largest garbage company . Using the same grit and gumption , Huizenga parlayed 19 Blockbuster stores into a 3,200-store empire . " Huizenga is one of the world 's great salesmen , " says Roy Akers , who follows the entertainment industry for the investment firm Advest Inc. in Boca Raton . " He makes Ross Perot look like he 's backing up . " <P> So who better than Huizenga ( pronounced High-zenga ) to charge into the brawl between Viacom Inc. and the QVC shopping network for control of Paramount Communications ? With the aim of accelerating Blockbuster 's expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest $600 million in Viacom last week and thereby strengthen the MTV owner 's $7.6-billion bid for Paramount . The move gave Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone critical support in his battle with QVC chairman Barry Diller for Paramount , though Redstone will need even more help to get closer to QVC 's nearly $10 billion offer . " This opens up new dimensions for us , " Huizenga says . " It clearly puts us in a better position to be more involved in entertainment than ever before . " <P> That will be true even if Viacom fails to win Paramount . Under terms of the agreement , Blockbuster can withdraw half its investment and still retain its seat on the Viacom board if Viacom does not acquire Paramount by Aug. 31 , 1994 . <P> Huizenga , whose personal fortune is worth some $600 million , is bent on transforming Blockbuster into a 21st century entertainment juggernaut . While he claims the coming of interactive TV that will allow people to call up movies on demand will not hurt his video business  --  as industry analysts frequently charge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he once bought garbage trucks . By the year 2000 , Huizenga plans to turn his stores into one-stop family centers that offer videos and recorded music discs as well as virtual-reality parlors and playgrounds for tots . At the same time , he is investing in film and TV studios and even raises the possibility of a Blockbuster cable-TV channel . " We 're going to be your neighborhood entertainment experience , your neighborhood Disney , " he says . <P> Though Huizenga lives near Blockbuster headquarters in Fort Lauderdale , his video stores have already made him a leading player in Hollywood . With revenues of more than $1.2 billion , Blockbuster accounts for fully 15% of all video rentals and can make or break movies , depending on how many it orders . The company can even help mend ailing careers : it turned actor Louis Gossett Jr . into a more viable star after his Rocky-like 1992 film Diggstown recovered from a box-office knockout to become a video champ . ( Blockbuster refuses to carry titles rated NC-17 and other so-called adult films. )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
