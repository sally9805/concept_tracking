<p> Earth 's ongoing biological drama  --  probably the longest-running and most highly acclaimed performance in our solar system  --  began in a potent brew of chemicals , some of which eventually arranged themselves into the first rough drafts of life . <p> That 's about as definite as the opening scenes of biological evolution get , constrained as they are by the limitations of current scientific knowledge . The story becomes less sketchy once the biochemistry of ancient organisms starts looking more like it does today . That turn point occurred between 3 billion and 4 billion years ago , when evolutionary caprice apparently remodeled the chemical foundations of the earliest life forms by instituting a DNA-based genetic system . Since then , every thing that has walked , flown , budded , swam , slithered or slunk on Earth has had DNA at its biological core . ( A few arguable exceptions exist in the world of viruses . ) With a molecular architecture that seems miraculous in its merging of simplicity and power , DNA  --  the stuff of genes  --  continues to assemble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For billions of years , this chain-like molecule has had but four molecular " letters " with which to spell out the genes for such traits as long tails , brown eyes , striped fur and orange beaks . Now , scientists in Switzerland have made new letters that link up into DNA and the closely related RNA almost as if they were part of the original alphabet . Though this feat is a significant accomplishment in itself , the researchers say they hope the added symbols will someday find practical use in medicine , research and industry , carrying new chemical messages that code for a world of new catalysts and other molecular tools . <p> Living cells  --  and now scientists themselves  --  assemble DNA and RNA molecules as if threading beads on a string , linking chemical components called nucleotides into linear arrangements with varying nucleotide sequences ( see side-bar ) . All the DNA and RNA molecules that have formed over the last several billion years , and therefore all the genes that have ever served as blueprints for cells , have been strung from a spartan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its chemical core , or base . In DNA , those bases are guanine , adenine , cytosine and thymine . In RNA , uracil replaces the thymine . <p> Just why DNA and RNA use only four bases remains one of the grand mysteries of biology . It was this question , coupled with the tantalizing biotechnological possibilities of making DNA and RNA from a larger set of ingredients , that sparked researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) in Zurich to design additional bases . The enzymes that naturally assemble DNA and RNA treat the new bases virtually the same as bona fide members of the traditional nucleotide club , the group reports in the Jan. 4 NATURE . <p> " We have expanded the genetic alphabet from four to six letters , " asserts molecular biologist Steven A. Benner , who leads the research team . This laboratory achievement demonstrates that if the evolutionary drama had unfolded differently , it theoretically could have included more than four building blocks for DNA and RNA . Still , the fact that four bases have sufficed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fundamental chemical constraints prohibited additional bases from joining the molecular chains of life . " If seems we need a more subtle explanation for the four-letter code , " Benner says . <p> Why , then , would anyone bother to try to expand the genetic alphabet ? Just as adding letters to any alphabet multiplies the number of words the alphabet can form , an expanded genetic alphabet should enable researchers to build a more diverse population of DNA and RNA molecules , Benner says . Some of these RNA molecules may possess useful catalytic powers . One goal of Benner 's group and a few other research teams around the world is to make a molecule that copies itself without assistance from other molecules ( SN : 6/17/89 , p.372 ) . Benner says he suspects this would prove easier if scientists had a larger pool of letters to draw upon . <p> Gerald Joyce of the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla , Calif. , notes that pharmaceutical companies want to develop RNA and DNA impostors , or analogs , that would counter the often-deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the AIDS-causing HIV . <p> And with a far more speculative tone , the ETH researchers suggest in their report that " the extra letters in the genetic alphabet might eventually be used to expand the genetic code . " In principle , this could enable biotechnologists to design an enormously enlarged repertoire of proteins from the expanded set of amino acids that the new alphabet could potentially encode . Researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , already have developed laboratory methods for incorporating artificial amino acids into proteins . And since nature 's own staggeringly diverse universe of proteins  --  which function as both structural molecules and enzymes  --  springs from only 20 types of amino acids , additional amino acid ingredients could expand that universe into unfathomable dimensions . <p> But first things first . Benner readily admits that creating a new universe of proteins from an expanded genetic code remains wishful thinking for the moment . So far , he and his colleagues have gotten RNA and DNA polymerases  --  cell-derived enzymes that link nucleotides into RNA or DNA chains  --  to reliably install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA and RNA . While a number of researchers have achieved somewhat similar feats in the lab using clever chemical techniques that do not involve enzymes , the new work marks the first time scientists have coaxed cellular enzymes into threading nonstandard nucleotides along the same string as the traditional ones . <p> When DNA in a cell nucleus becomes active , it either replicates ( during periods of growth or reproduction ) or serves as a template for making complementary RNA molecules ( during normal cell metabolism ) . This RNA then carries the genetic code out of the nucleus to other cellular sites , where ribosomes read the so-called messenger RNA liked data tape to guide the assembly of proteins . The fidelity of DNA replication or its transcription into messenger RNA results from the exclusive molecular relationships between certain pairs of bases on the genetic beads . <p> The bases fall into two complementary chemical categories : purines , which have two fused rings of atoms ; and pyrimidines , which have a single ring structure . In DNA , the purine base adenine always pairs with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pyrimidine cytosine . These two combinations are known as the Watson-Crick base pairs . Other combinations of the bases do not last long because they lack the patterns of stabilizing hydrogen bonds that strongly favor the formation of the Watson-Crick base pairs . <p> Benner and co-workers Joseph A. Piccirilli , Tilman Krauch and Simon E. Moroney set out to design a third Watson-Crick base pair . The synthetic couple would have to be so similar to the traditional base pairs in shape , size and chemistry that the RNA and DNA polymerases would recognize them as eligible genetic beads . Yet any new Watson-Crick base pair would also require its own exclusive pattern on hydrogen bonding to prevent unwanted pairing between a new base and a standard base . ( Earlier Watson-Crick-pair candidates allowed too many mispairings to be useful . ) Without this inviolable one-to-one pairing , DNA replication or transcription into messenger RNA would lack the precision needed for reliable reproduction , growth or protein manufacturing . In short , life in its present form would be impossible . <p> In their NATURE article , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that almost meets these criteria . The new pyrimidine , which they named kappa , differs from the traditional pyrimidines ( cytosine , uracil and thymine ) in the orientation of its nitrogen atoms . As a result , the pattern of hydrogen bonds it can form with its new purine  --  designated pi and designed for exclusive complementary-pairing with kappa  --  is unique . <p> When the scientists chemically synthesized pairs of complementary strands of DNA , including the new kappa-pi Watson-crick pair , they were pleased to find that the strands bonded to each other with nearly as much stability as normal strands lacking the " funny bases , " as Benner calls them . <p> " These results indicated that enzymatic incorporation of a new base selectively opposite its complement in a DNA template would be possible , " the team concludes . <p> But pi 's molecular structure has a small chemical side group that the natural purines lack . Although the researchers found this difference unimportant when they used strictly chemical means for linking nucleotides , they feared it would prove too exotic for recognition by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzymatic studies , they chose to use xanthosine , a naturally occurring purine with a structure very similar to pi . Xanthosine retains the exclusive hydrogen-bonding pattern of the kappa-pi pair but lacks pi 's foreign-looking chemical group . <p> The kappa-xanthosine pair performed as the researchers had hoped . When they made short DNA template strands that included a kappa bead , the RNA and DNA polymerases assembled complementary strands with the xanthosine bases always opposite the kappa . Errors were nearly as rare as in control experiments using traditional base pairs , the researchers note in their report . And in the time since the paper was written , ETH 's Christopher Y. Switzer has shown that installing xanthosine in the template directs the polymerases to faithfully incorporate kappa into the appropriate spots on product strands , Benner told SCIENCE NEWS . <p> " The real goal here is to have an RNA molecule that 's able to replicate itself , " says Benner . That would be a first step toward such visionary goals as creating lifelike chemical systems in a test tube . Finding self-making molecules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized enzymes like polymerases , is the golden ring for a small community of origin-of-life researchers . <p> There may be some bugs with the new letters , cautions Leslie Orgel of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego , in a commentary accompanying the research report . For one , he notes , the xanthosine base carries an extra bit negative charge that could prevent the forming of double helices or other molecular arrangements important for biological activity . <p> Says Benner : " With one funny base in a backbone of normal bases , we do n't see any problem . " But he concedes that no one knows how longer chains with more funny bases will behave . " We have taken a step in a rather long series of steps that is necessary for getting something that is self-replicating . " <p> Orgel questions the need to add letters to the genetic alphabet for the goal of building new catalytic RNA molecules . " Maybe four are enough to work with , " he suggests . In addition , he says , chemists are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder-to-handle enzymes could soon become more trouble that it 's worth . <p> But Benner suspects otherwise . By adding bases with different chemical features to the pool of ingredients for making RNA molecules , he says , researchers will have more to work with in designing catalysts for performing specific chemical transformations . Even with the Berkeley group 's advances in making proteins with synthetic amino acids , deliberate engineering of catalytic RNA to perform specific molecular jobs may still emerge as an easier task , Benner asserts , Protein designers still do not understand how linear sequences of amino acids fold into the three-dimensional arrangements they must assume to function properly . " In RNA , we actually understand how this works . " Benner says . <p> Combining this understanding of structure with a larger variety of nucleotide-building blocks will better enable researchers to understand and control RNA molecular structure and therefore , to design RNA-based catalysts , he predicts . <p> Manipulating bases is n't the only way in which scientists have tweaked the structures of RNA and DNA . " People have tried to change everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , he notes , another ETH scientist has replaced the nucleotides ' five-membered ribose sugar component with the six-member glucose . " Basically any sugar has been tried , " says Joyce . <p> Stanley Miller of the University of California , San Diego , experiments with bases that have more open structures , lacking the rings characteristic of the bases in normal DNA and RNA . Others have tried changing the type of chemical bond that links the nucleotides . Benner , for instance , is building DNA- and RNA-style structures with sulfur-containing chemical bridges instead of the normal **28;58;TOOLONG link . Orgel has tried using an amide linkage , the same type of chemical bond that links amino acids into proteins . <p> Driving many of these experiments is the scientific enigma of how life began . After scrutinizing the molecular biology of living organisms , many origin-of-life researchers have come to suspect that a so-called RNA world preceded the DNA-based life forms that have presided for more than 3 billion years ( SN : 10/7/89 , p.229 ) . They argue that the ancient RNA , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also served for a time as the sole carrier of genetic information . <p> But RNA itself may have evolved from an even earlier information carrier . When scientists reconstruct what they envision as the most likely conditions of the equally plausible molecular structures . Rather , they speculate that something else  --  something that could copy itself and also evolve into the present forms of RNA  --  embodied the very beginnings of life . Experiments like those of Benner , Orgel and Miller help constrain such theories . Virtually all scientists in this field hope that one day they may find life in their test-tube versions of the primordial womb . <p> " This is different from usual science , " Miller remarks . " You 're trying to reconstruct an historical event  --  the origin of life . " And good things happen along the way . " As one tries to go through the steps of constructing these self-replicating systems , you encounter all sorts of chemistry that you would not encounter otherwise , " Benner says . " It 's a problem not many people look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understanding anything about living systems . " <p> DIAGRAM : Benner and his co-workers designed two new bases whose pattern of hydrogen bonds differs from the standard ones , thereby enforcing a new pattern of exclusive pairing between them . Together they represent a third Watson-Crick base pair . The new bases , kappa ( ? ) and pi ( p ) , also differ from the standard bases in that they bond to sugar component of their respective nucleotides through a carbon atom rather than through a nitrogen atom . Also shown is the naturally occurring base xanthosine ( X ) , which shares the kappa-pi hydrogen bond pattern but lacks a biochemically " foreign " feature that might prevent polymerases from working with pi . The researchers showed that polymerases install xanthosine-containing nucleotides opposite the kappa nucleotides , and vice versa . <p> By Ivan Amato , New symbols added to genetic molecules form unknown messages <p> Nucleic acids : The threads of life <p> Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) are composed of nucleotides , which themselves are built of three chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> phosphoric acid groups , which link one nucleotide to another like vertebrae in a spine <p> sugars ( ribose in RNA , deoxyribose in DNA ) , which couple each base to a phosphate group . <p> The bases fit into two chemically complementary categories-the purines and pyrimidines . The term purine denotes a molecular framework marked by a five-sided ring of atoms fused to a six-sided ring . Adenine and guanine serve as the purines in both RNA and DNA . In DNA , cytosine and thymine are the pyrimidines , characterized by their single six-sided ring . In RNA , uracil replaced the thymine . <p> DNA and RNA chains form when enzymes called polymerases sequentially link adjacent nucleotides . In RNA and in single-stranded DNA molecules , purines and pyrimidines can link in virtually any sequence of virtually any length . But double-stranded DNA can form only when the sequences of bases form only when the sequences of bases on the two strands are complementary . And this occurs only when the adenines of one strand line up with cytosines . The adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine pairings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds in each of the two pairs enforces exclusive pairings . <p> With the help of polymerases , double-stranded DNA can make multiple copies of itself because each of its two strands serves as a chemical " negative " for the other . When the strands separate , one acts as a template upon which a DNA polymearase can assemble a new , complementary strand . The result : a pair of identical , double-stranded DNA molecules . <p> To transcribe DNA into complementary RNA , an RNA polymerase uses one strand of the DNA duplex as a template for assembling a complementary sequence containing uracils wherever the DNA sequence had an adenine base .
