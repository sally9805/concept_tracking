THERE WERE ENOUGH consequences in life without looking for them . But some people made a fair living by it , and who was he to tell them they were wrong . Em sat across the desk from the court-appointed counselor , a heavyset woman with dewlaps and a pushed-in face , who favored the right side of the room to the left so that he was kept firmly in view , less so Judith , his wife of over ten years who sat composed on the sofa . He 'd chosen the chair for logistical reasons . Easier to get back out of than the sofa Judith had fallen into so gracefully . The counselor looked up at them after a brief perusal of their files . <p> She smiled at Em . It was disconcerting in the way it is to see a bulldog smile . " You 're Emmett deSnoo ? " <p> Em winced . She 'd pronounced it " snoo " instead of " snow " ; she 'd called him Emmett instead of Em . Judith corrected her , as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and set the record straight . <p> " When did you lose your arm , Emmett ? " <p> He waved his hand , realized it was the one that was n't there anymore . He had n't done that in a while now . It brought home how nervous he was about this whole child-custody business . " Four years ago this past August , " he said . <p> She got right down to business . " Has it affected your relationship with your child ? " <p> He 'd met better-dressed stupidity before . " It would have to , would n't it ? " <p> Her eyebrow rose . " I mean , " he went on , " I carry him in one arm . I cook and serve him breakfast with one hand . " <p> " You hold it against him , " Judith cut in . <p> " So you believe . " He winced at the bitterness in his own voice , knew how it sounded in the confinement of the office , how it must sound to the woman behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve into his pants . Judith accused him of doing that every time he was in trouble  --  a way of calling attention to the fact that he was crippled . A way of shaming others . And perhaps she 'd had something there , early on , in the first months ; he did n't know . Now it was just something he found himself doing , like checking his fly , like listening for his boy Brad in the next room or out in the yard . <p> He had to be careful here . The counselor was watching them both closely though she made no apparent effort at it , sitting snug behind her desk , her elbows , pouched with skin , resting on the mahogany desktop as if for a comfortable conversation with friends . She had the look of someone who had seen it all and had long since ceased to wear her concerns on the skin . That she was smart he had no doubt . That she was practiced with people ( as Em had never been outside of his job ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Judith , her history of their early marriage  --  the rapid-fire courtship and the resulting no-trim ceremony . He listened to Judith 's recounting , her speech economical and precise , and he marveled , as he always did , at how she could be so comfortable in such different situations . She could mix with the mill hands at the bar or meet with a group of lawyers . She was a woman for each occasion , her manner and voice ranging from the clipped speech of reporting to the easy manner of a chat over a fence . He thought about how liquid her voice had been the time he was driving and she climbed from the frontseat into the back of his car to tease sweet obscenities into his ear until he became distracted enough to stop and join her  --  two years married then and laughing at the awkwardness of elbows and knees . Judith chronicled her rise from a clerk at the mill to a legal clerk at a two-man law office to legal secretary and researcher for a team of four . She touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , their surprise when they conceived Bradley right after they 'd given up hope . <p> " How do you account for that , Judith ? " the counselor asked . <p> " Resignation . " Judith released a deep breath . <p> " And you , Emmett ? " <p> He shrugged , not about to subject himself to that raised brow again . He 'd trashed the self-help books , pitched the thermometers and spread her across the kitchen table still set with the breakfast dishes . He was n't about to tell her the coffee cups rattled in the saucers , or that the table walked a good two feet across the floor and the bacon was ground into her thighs , but damn it had been good . " Luck , " he said . <p> " And so you were happy ? " <p> " Yes , " Judith said . " The baby filled our lives . " <p> Behind the counselor was the only window in the room , looking out over the Bitterroot Range , Blue Mountain in the foreground . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahogany table with carnations pooled in the reflected surface , wainscoted walls  --  good craftsmanship , mahogany again , expensive , impressive but dark  --  where certificates ranged . He sat quietly in his seat , trying not to appear outlandish in the neat office , fearing the common ground forming between these two professionals . They were women . They shared good taste . They were smart . He felt doomed . <p> What Judith did n't mention was that those first years the baby filled her life . He did n't begrudge it , too much . She 'd given nine months , borne incredible pain ; it was her investment . That was part of the consequences  --  you give that much , you reap the benefits . Anyway , he 'd enjoyed watching her drop her gown to nurse the baby  --  her white breasts , nipples like new moons the baby latched onto with greed and satisfaction . But what did that leave him to offer the child ? A finger to hold onto ? <p> " I quit work to stay home with Brad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mention what a sacrifice that had been . How she 'd enjoyed her work and was good at it . But it was there between the women , Em knew , as obvious as if spoken out loud . " I was so clumsy at first with him , " she admitted . Her legs crossed and uncrossed . " I dropped him once . He was seven months old , and I was leaning over with him in my arms . " One of her arms cupped to her side as if she were holding the baby again . " And reached to pick something up with my other hand and he kicked . " <p> The counselor nodded reassuringly . <p> " Out of my arm . It was n't that far , but he fell . Right to the ground . God . I watched him for hours . I did n't sleep that whole night . I swore I would never lose him again . Do you understand ? " Her knees were clamped together and she was speaking to Em . <p> He admired Judith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated move . For her it was an honest one . Yes . She was a good mother . But that left it up to him to bring home the money , in a job at the mill where layoffs were the practice and hires the exception . Promotion was a thing you scrabbled for , twelve- and fourteen-hour days , six-day weeks . He 'd moved from the yard to the floor and saws . Which made the whole business even crazier . He 'd come home tired , choke back some food , and crash . He did n't remember Bradley as a baby . He remembered Corky , the walleyed kid who , after one year , fled to college short two of the fingers he came on duty with . There was the sour smell of the mill , and nights when the stacks spewed smoke in columns tamping out the stars , leveling the sky to a few hundred feet overhead , and the mill pond burned with reflected fire so that he thought the whole world was being consumed as the men sat in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they always did , just to keep it interesting . No , he did n't remember Bradley as a baby . If he had n't been a good father back then , just maybe it came of her being a good mother . That was the trouble with studying consequences  --  it was endless . It led to blame . <p> " And was it that way for you , Emmett ? " <p> Em foundered . " We got lost for awhile , I think , " he said . <p> " And how was that ? " <p> Counselors were like shrinks . They did n't have a damned answer you did n't provide them with . But they had their fill of questions . He had to give them that . " I was busy . At work . Judith had the baby . " <p> " So , you were n't happy ? " <p> " It was different . " He could see Judith looked hurt by his answer , still wanting to believe that , up until the accident , life had been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . " But it was okay , you know , just different . " <p> Em glanced away , wishing he could stand up , move around . He studied a large picture on the wall as if he could move into it . <p> The counselor turned to see what he was looking at . She pushed off on the chair , casters rolling easily over the carpeting . Under the picture , she stood up . She was taller than Em had expected , all her height in her legs . She looked over her shoulder and asked , " Do you hunt , Emmett ? " <p> " Used to , " Emmett answered . <p> " And you , Judith ? " <p> Judith nodded her head toward Emmett . " He 'd hunt , I 'd gut . Em was never much good with blood . " <p> It was an oil of a wooded scene at dusk . In the foreground stood a tree , oak maybe , Em thought , though he 'd seen few enough of those . This was ponderosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut  --  the big dollar tree  --  sweet-smelling , with a grain so close and tight the wood came burnished off the saws . <p> She nosed close to the picture . " There 's a deer in here , a sizable buck . " She pointed to a darker area in the picture and Em thought he could make out the shape of a rack among the branches . The counselor stood back a few feet . " My husband 's work . One of his best . " She dropped into the chair , whisked back behind her desk . " It 's what Hank paints  --  pheasant , duck , elk , like a puzzle  --  find the animal in the picture . It 's the mathematician in him , I think . " <p> " He from the Midwest ? " Em asked . <p> She looked up at him in interest . " Because he 's a math teacher ? " <p> Em smiled . " Because it 's a third-generation forest . " He was sure of it now . " Oaks . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearest detail is the remembered detail . He 's right , you know . Does n't matter if it 's true as long as it 's accurate . " She smiled over at Em , then glanced down again at the closed file . " How long have you been divorced ? " <p> " One year , " Judith said . <p> " And two months , " Em added . He watched the brow rise again . Judith nodded from her seat on the sofa . <p> " And you were married almost eleven years . Your son is seven now ? " They both nodded . " And four months , " Judith threw in , looking pleased , always having enjoyed a good game of one-upmanship . <p> But this was no game , and all this easy conversation did was lead you to believe it was play . And what came of it , anyway , trying to fit into a place you were never made for and pretending you could tell your story in an hour , letting yourself believe the story you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now , more than any time in the last two years , he wanted his arm back . He wanted both hands . Still believing that if he had them , he could set her up on the counselor 's desk like he had on the breakfast table , on the hood of the car , on the edge of their bed and make her believe in him again , in front of the puzzled deer , the counselor , God and the snow-capped mountains just beyond the window . And if that was n't the whole answer to their problems , it would have been a good start . But none of that was going to happen . He was going to sit there , with his arm a hole on his side , his wife good as gone and taking his boy with her . <p> " What happened , Emmett ? You said marriage was different with Bradley there , but in your own words it was still ' okay . ' " <p> The room smelled of beeswax , like the interior of a hollowed trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , and he knew what that was like . The counselor pushed because it was her job . Because it was her nature . " What happened ? " she asked again . <p> Em stretched his legs out , trying for a calmness he did n't feel . " Ask her , " he said . " It was her idea to end it . " <p> " Blame . You 're good at that . " Judith leaned toward the counselor , her own anger slipping out . " He blamed his son , a three-year-old baby , for the accident , and now he wants custody . " <p> " Bullshit . " Em tried to rise from the chair , hefted himself clear and then stood there , feeling clumsy and foolish . " Bullshit , " he repeated softly . " I never blamed him . " <p> " Why would you ? " the counselor went on , as if she had n't heard Em speak , as if she 'd already chosen sides . He sank back into the chair . The counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to hear Emmett tell me . " <p> He knew what she wanted . Judith looked smaller than she had before , her hands clasped together in her lap . She was worried . She was concerned about how much pity might be aroused by his story . He was embarrassed that Judith thought him capable of that . " About what ? " Em asked . <p> " Would you like to tell me about the accident , Emmett ? " <p> No . He did n't want to tell her . Out the window , over the counselor 's head , on the far side of the valley and beyond the city 's limits , Blue Mountain had grown larger overnight with the last evening 's early snowfall . Snow did that  --  scratched every jag and peak clear against the blue sky , the breadth and distance revealed . But that was only illusion . Once you got up into the mountains , snow compressed the world , squeezed it into a tight space overhead and underfoot , swallowed everything  --  sound to your own hard breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of your fingertips slowly going numb . <p> " Up near Deer Creek , I was getting some wood left over from a logging operation . One of the perks . Brad was with me . " The boy was dressed in a pair of rolled-cuff denim jeans , a quilted red flannel jacket and brimmed cap . Em had taken pleasure in lacing up the child-sized hiking boots , the only ones Brad would wear when going to the mountains . One of those clean days , ponderosas like pitch in the air and the road rising evenly beneath the truck as the earth fell away at the side . " We were up a ways when I saw a car stopped by some deadfall across the road . " He patted the boy 's knees . A wet line from the corner of his mouth formed a moist patch on the jacket front . Em used his thumb to wipe away the drool . The boy 's eyelids flickered briefly and remained closed . For the time it took Em to inhale he sat watching his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamt , but what young boys dream . The truth was , he did n't know his son well enough to hazard a guess . <p> " They needed some help and Brad was asleep , so I put the truck in park " ( the automatic being a concession to Judith , though he 'd never laid that blame on her ) , " put on the parking brake . It was on . They checked . " He left the door open , not wanting to awaken Brad just yet . Two men and himself , they 'd have the tree , a fair-sized spruce eroded off the left bank , clear of the road in no time . The incline was n't too steep , but he cranked the wheel , just in case . <p> On his own , he probably could have rolled over it with the fourwheel drive , but others had stopped , and it offended his sense of decency to leave a fallen tree across a road . A road was a clean thing you drove your family over , and he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the spruce , when he heard the noise of gravel grating beneath tires , the startled grunt from one of the men . At first he 'd thought another vehicle was coming up the road . He turned to wave them back . " The truck was rolling . There was this drop-off  --  about a thirty-foot drop into ponderosas and scree  --  and the truck was rolling . . . " So slowly that he did n't believe it at first , thinking it a trick of hearing ' or like when he 'd be stopped in a parking lot and the car next to him would start pulling away and he 'd think it was his car , only now he thought it was the road maybe , that the truck was still parked and stationary , and the road and the mountainside itself had shifted strangely . It took him a moment to understand , to release the tree from his hands , nearly pausing to wipe them on his jeans and then he was running , trying to catch up with the truck and every second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others behind him , felt a tug at his shirt as one of them tried to stop him . The windshield was a glaze of sunlight . As he ran he thought of other possibilities  --  he 'd roused Bradley out of the truck and settled him safely on the roadside , Bradley had awakened , had gotten himself out of the truck , he had never brought Bradley along . As he came even with the door , he could see Brad fey 's head drooped sideways onto his shoulder , his lips open and the drool mark , crimson and growing on the jacket . <p> " I caught up to the truck just as it was hitting the shoulder of the road . And as the truck rolled down the ravine "  --  this was the part he never let himself remember except in dreams , and then it would come up out of nowhere and jerk him awake  --  " the door took my arm off . " At the time , he only knew his sleeve had been pulled free like some Hitchcock movie where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm slips out whole and safe . But it had n't . <p> " And Bradley ? " the counselor asked , her fingers quietly drumming the desktop . <p> " About ten feet down the truck hit an old ponderosa and stopped dead . Bradley had a bruised shoulder from the seat belt . One of the men put a tourniquet on me , laid me in the backseat , Bradley up front , threw the arm in the trunk and hauled ass to the hospital . End of story . " Which of course it was n't . There had been the long rid e d own the mountainside , his head in the lap of a stranger who worked the tourniquet while another drove the car singing to Bradley to keep the child calm . Singing the only song he claimed he knew all the words to , " One hundred bottles of beer on the wall , one hundred bottles of beer . " <p> The counselor rocked back in her chair , her eyes shut . " If Bradley had n't been there , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the chair upholstery with both hands , the one that was there and the one that was n't . He enjoyed the temporary sensation of believing what he knew was not so , as though he could lean on that phantom and it would sustain him , which was stupidity because you could n't let yourself believe in that . She was waiting for an answer , watching him now , maintaining eye contact , in what he was sure she believed to be a forthright and disarming manner , no pun intended . She wanted him to feel free to tell her anything . She wanted to know if it had been a conscious decision on his part . She was offering him an out . " Lady , I ai n't stupid , " he said . " It 's just a truck . " Judith sighed , in relief he supposed . He stepped in again : " But it was my decision . " And that should put an end to it , but he knew it would n't . <p> The counselor seemed satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They talked comfortably . In another circumstance they would be friends , he thought . They were discussing present custodial arrangements  --  joint custody , one week with him , one with her , alternating weekends and holidays . Judith and Em lived within blocks of each other and Brad 's school , where he had started second grade just two weeks ago . Em bought a small house with the settlement from the truck manufacturer , lived on disability and studied accounting at nights . What he lacked in natural aptitude for mathematics he believed would be overridden by determination and the physical realities . Not that he 'd let his handicap rule him entirely . He 'd also taken up horseback riding , which would give Judith no end of amusement , if she knew about it  --  which was why he had n't told her . <p> Before they 'd married , when they were in the early days of courting and both working at the mill , Judith had been a barrel racer . Hardly what you 'd call a rodeo star , but consistently good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like much out of saddle or under but knew how to cut an unnerving pin around the barrels and not give them so much as a breeze to tremble on . He would sit up in the stands , flick gnats out of his flat beer and count down the events : bareback broncs , calf roping , bulldogging , team roping , saddle broncs . The afternoon would turn drowsy , Stetsons shoved back on heads , sweat stains riding down from armpits and up from crotches , elbows kinked on the bleacher backs while the announcer reeled off a half-doze " bad jokes and the rodeo clown played the crowd . Finally , the moon would wobble up over the Sapphire Range and the fairground lights would come on overhead , moths crowding up against the glass shades sending shadows big as bats chasing over the ladies ' laps , and the announcer would call out women 's barrel racing as the next-to-last event , and the men would rise , half-emptying the stands to go for beer , take a stretch or a piss before the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind the arena he could see the women riders , holding those crazy-in-the-head animals to a jitterbugging canter , warming up muscles , stretching out tendons . But he would walk down to the cyclone fence , his fingers linked to the wire , leaning close to see Judith , wearing the only fringed western shirt she owned , smoking a cigarette and walking out her mare while the other young girls churned around her , their horses slathered with sweat from excitement . " Nothing crazier than a barrel horse , " Judith once said . " Got all the usual cues ass-backwards . Relax the reins they run full-out , tighten up they only run half-full-out . " <p> " How do you get them to walk ? " he 'd asked . <p> " You get off their damn backs , " she 'd answered . They 'd laughed about that over drinks on their first date , as if he 'd known anything about horses at the time . <p> She gave it up when they married . Sold her horse to a twelve-year old 4-H kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath her . Judith had packed away the trophies , ribbons , and photos and never said another word about it . None of those lawyers she worked for knew about that . He would bet on it . For all those men knew about her everyday worklife , only he knew she had run barrels . He could believe it because Judith had excised that part as cleanly and neatly as the truck had his arm . He wondered , sitting there in the failing light of the counselor 's office , if at times she still felt the horse under her , the dizzy momentum of the hairpin turns around the barrels , and then stretching low , snatched tight over the horse 's neck , hands pushing the reins free , cueing the horse to run hell-bent the last fifty yards out of the arena while the crowds cheered and screamed , everybody , after all , loving a horse race , even if it 's a woman 's . Did it come to her at odd moments that she was missing something ? He felt comforted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're to be married soon ? " The counselor was speaking to Judith , who looked embarrassed , as if caught in a small act of vandalism . " Yes , " she answered , avoiding Em 's eyes . " This spring . Ted 's been offered a position in the South . Louisiana . " <p> " Louisiana  --  shit , " Em exhaled . He shifted in his seat . " Red dirt and water moccasins . " <p> That was the real reason behind her bid for sole custody and his counter-quit . Joint custody was no longer convenient . She was leaving . She would take Brad with her . " He can have Brad for two holidays each year and every summer , " she said . " We 'll take care of transportation . It 'll be easier on him with his arm and all . " <p> " That 's my Jude , always thinking of me first , " Em said . <p> " Are you being facetious , Mr. deSnoo ? " <p> Em paused for a moment  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes you had to give the devil his due . He studied the counselor . He 'd noticed her reverting to the form of Mr. as a rebuke . He wondered how he could tell her this without alienating her further . " Well , let me give you an example . After the accident , it took a long time to get my balance back . I guess that 's just the way it is . You feel lopsided , like you could tip at the oddest moments . Like when you 're making love  --  " <p> " Oh Christ , Em . " <p> He waved Judith back . She slumped further into the sofa , her left hand neatly concealing the side of her face . He might have taken some pleasure in Judith 's distress , but he was watching the counselor instead . She was stolid behind the desk , her eyes flicking back and forth in interest . <p> " In those last months , in bed , Jude got on top of me . " He paused for effect . " She used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselor leaned into her chair , tipped it back , and then stopped short and swayed forward again until her elbows were braced on the table , hands steepled under her chins . She smiled at Em like she 'd read his mind . He went on with it . " Jude used to half-joke that once you 'd had a thousand pounds of steaming horseflesh under you it just was n't the same with a 170-pound man . " He could see a smile curling under Judith 's hand . At the time he 'd answered that maybe she just had n't had the right 170-pound man under her , but once she 'd straddled him with those hard-muscled thighs , buttocks clenched and fingers gripping his chest till it hurt , he knew there was little he could do to surprise her in this position . He 'd flipped her over and kept her on her back most of their married life . She 'd loved it , and he was n't a slave to diversity . It had worked out well . " And she meant it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy . " <p> She became careful with him in the act of love , mindful of his balance without being told , as if she knew from those old days of riding when timing and movement were essential . in those last months , she took charge , laid him on the mattress beneath her . When she rode him it was with thighs still firm , both hands braced on either side of his chest , and though she never intended to make him feel so , he felt diminished . <p> " And so Judith rode you , " the counselor said , her voice level and thoughtful . <p> " Yes , " he said , and found that his throat ached . He could have given her other examples , he supposed . Judith hauling him up out of one depression after another . Judith outfitting everything in the house with velcro , from shoes to baby diapers . Judith going back to work to support them . But would n't he have done the same for her ? Had n't he ? <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continued . " And more than that , " he admitted . " She tried hard . We both did . But the fact is that now she 's leaving and wants to take Bradley with her , and the fact also is that for these last four years I 've been the one who 's raised him . That should stand for something too . " <p> " Is that true , Judith ? Has he been the primary care-giver for Brad these last four years ? " <p> Judith spread her hands out before her , as if the counselor should divine the past from her palms . " After the accident , I had to go back to work . Brad was still only three years old . We could n't afford day care ; hell , we could barely afford rent and groceries . So , you see , I had to go back to work . " She ran a hand through her short hair , unconscious of the cowlick it raised . " And , Christ , it was n't as if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd given up everything but self-pity . " <p> Em nodded his head . " But that changed , did n't it Jude ? " <p> " Yes , " she agreed . " After about six months , he seemed to be coming back to his old self , only . . . " <p> " Only what ? " the counselor asked . <p> " Only different . " <p> Em waited . He waited for the counselor to push . He held his breath , willing her to ask Judith as she 'd asked him , " How was it different ? " The counselor sat there with her stubby fingers interlocked on the desk , staring between them , maybe to the door sealed behind them , or a wall clock nearing the end of their appointed hour , the first of three counselor appointments . Come on , he urged . Ask her . <p> But Judith picked it up herself . " Absorbed . Obsessed . Everything focused around Bradley . We could n't talk anymore but about how he 'd potty-trained Brad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Em unscrewed the lids . Christ , I might as well not have been there . It was like he lost his arm and . . . " <p> " Found his son ? " the counselor asked quietly . <p> There was a hush in the room , as if something was about to befall them . He braced himself against hope even as his mind ran with the possibilities . Judith 's head reared back . She lifted from her place on the sofa , walked over to the desk and placed her fists on it knuckle down . " That 's unfair , " she said . And damn but he admired her . <p> " Is it ? " the counselor asked evenly . <p> " Yes . It was n't like that . It was like he lost his arm and Bradley had to pay the price . " She turned toward Em . <p> Em shifted in his seat , confounded by the direction the conversation had taken . How did she mean " pay the price " ? She 'd become jealous . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , but had n't she excluded him those first years ? And had n't he conceded her her rights at the time ? She was his mother . She 'd given Brad her body , borne the pain . It was the natural order of parenthood , that first bond between mother and child , with the father moving about on the periphery trusting that the years would close the gap . But circumstances had changed all that . The tables had turned , he 'd given part of himself , borne the pain , he 'd earned his fair share of the boy . <p> " Sex , " Judith said , her face moving close to Em 's . " You want to talk about sex  --  I 'll tell you about sex . Sure he was clumsier , but it was n't that . He was inattentive . Always listening because maybe Bradley would wake up , maybe he should go check up on Bradley . I thought it would get better , but it did n't . I could n't hold my own son anymore because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding Em now , leaning into the side where his arm should have been . " He knew what Brad needed . He needed Brad , and I did n't . Brad 's his new reason for living . That 's the big payoff , and what the hell child needs to be saddled with that ? " She was out of breath . She straightened up , smoothed down her hair , and walked calmly back to her seat on the sofa . <p> There was a knock at the window and Em looked up , startled to see a bird slip down the glass and tumble from the sill . Where it had hit there was a spattering of color , like duff from a moth 's wing , browns , rust , and a bright splurge of yellow . Was that how it really was ? he wondered . Could it all be reduced to a debt made payable ? Had it been ? <p> The counselor turned her head to the window . " Ah , that happens often , " she said . " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it anymore . " <p> Em stared out the window , over the counselor 's shoulder . He could still feel Judith 's breath on his cheek like a kiss . Judith called him obsessed ; he preferred passionate . The morning Judith had gone out to inquire about work at her old law firm , he was left at home with Brad , stalling through the day as he had for the five months since the accident . The absent arm was still a continual ache back then , a prickling down the phantom elbow and into the hand , so that he was prone to reach for it like an arm gone dead in the middle of the night  --  just enough of a presence to remind him it was n't there . Brad was restless , shy around him . By midday Em had had enough . He dressed Brad in his coat , muffler , and mittens , strapped on the new velcro-laced shoes , and took him for a walk . They went to the mill , where he knew the first shift would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter men would hunch outside to get a breath of air , blow sawdust out of their noses , clap their pants and spread a cloud of yellow around their feet like pollen . <p> Lymon had been the first to notice Em standing at the fence with Brad tugging to run free from his remaining hand . They came over in a tidy group . They were not strangers to maiming and so as a group gave him a good look , nodded , and put it into words . <p> " On your feet and looking good , " Lymon had started out . <p> Tom squinted . " Lost some weight , huh ? " <p> That was Em 's cue to handle it as he would . " Mostly on the left side , " he answered easily . It was the good answer . He could tell by the way they reformed to a looser grouping . <p> " They going to give you one of those fake arms ? " Cyril asked . <p> " A prosthesis , dummy , " Tom said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He better , " Lymon threw in . " They just put him on the saw this week . " <p> " If it 's any consolation , Cyril , " Em said , " I never missed a day because of job-related injuries . " The men laughed and Em leaned up against the fence , enjoying the feeling that he could still fit in . " Any work here for a one-armed bandit ? " Bradley latched onto the fence , tried hauling himself up onto it . The chain links rattled under his snub-toed boots . <p> " Might check up at the office . " Lymon looked tired . " But if I was you I 'd look at a different line of work . Less lumber , more cutbacks . Same old shit . " He was fifty , old by lumber-industry standards , made older with the fear they 'd lay him off before his early retirement date . " That your boy ? " <p> Em nodded . <p> " Quite an armful , " Lymon said as Bradley monkeyed up the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip . Em swayed slightly , then felt Brad latch on to his waist with his small legs . He rode there comfortably , and for the first time in months Em felt as though he 'd found more than he 'd lost . There was a quiet in the men 's faces . They ducked their heads to say goodbye and went back to work . Em stood there awhile watching the yellow haze from the smokestacks slant across the sky and settle into the hollows of the valley , homes and streets slipping into a fog . A truck rolled into the yard , logs stacked evenly , snow still packed in the bark and a few green limbs trailing over the rear wheels . He could smell the sap and the cut . <p> " Emmett ? " the counselor was asking . " Do you want to add something to that ? " <p> He felt tired , the act of sitting upright a matter of will . Em looked at the counselor then over at Judith who sat poised on the edge of the sofa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffed . She 'd always had beautiful hands . She used to tease him about his short square hands  --  a working man 's hands , and then she 'd slap them and say " Get to work , man . " It was a joke he 'd almost forgotten . " She 's right , " he said . " I needed Brad . But it was n't like that . He was learning everything ; I was learning everything over again . " And yet that was n't all of it either . Unasked for , Brad had given him trust . Brad would not remember his father as Em had used to be with two arms . He had , for all means and purposes , just become a father . For Brad and Em this was how it was , how it is . But how did you explain something like that ? How do you explain what you gain and what you lose ? They 'd taken it all too far , and it seemed again to Em that consequences were a tangle you could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's making Brad pay me back  --  the cost of my arm . " <p> God damn but there were things on things unseen in every action . Even as he had been running for the truck , unaware that the last things he was to feel with that hand were the sap from a tree , the drool from his child 's lips , he had been full of all kinds of other awarenesses . He 'd had the time to take measure of the situation , his own distance and speed , the incline of the road , the acceleration of the truck . He knew the truck would take him along . He knew he would get hurt , maybe die . But that too was acceptable because it was known . What he could not risk in the end was the unknown . <p> And now Jude had turned it on him somehow , the decision not really his to be made anymore , but bearing entitlements and debts payable like some accounting system he had yet to learn how to juggle . In what column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love for his son ? And in the final tallying , what if Judith was right after all ? They were both waiting for his answer , and he had only one . " I do know this , I 've given as good as I got . You tell me , is that bad ? " And for once he hoped to God the counselor would n't come up with another question , but would have the answer . <p> " I do n't know , " she said . It was the only honest thing she could have said , and he respected that . She kept her eyes on his until he nodded and let her go . <p> The room was quiet , so that Em could almost believe the sound of his heart was louder than the clock that picked at the minutes overhead . Then there was a small cough from Judith and she spoke . " You 're a good man , Em . You 're a good father to Brad , just as I 'm a good mother . " She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good family . " She looked to the counselor for help . <p> Em sat eager in the pause , his head feeling strangely light , his body turned buoyant . He would ask for a second chance . Brad would hold them together where Em had failed . And then he remembered the feel of Brad on his hip , that sweet counterbalance , but it was like the hurt of his arm all over again . He looked over at Judith . She was waiting for him , and he found he had to do this one last thing for her . " But we are n't , " he admitted , his voice soft , and she ducked her head . <p> After a moment the counselor said , " Our time is nearly up . I 'll see you both next week ? " <p> Judith nodded , looking shaken . <p> " And if one of us does n't come ? " Em asked . <p> She looked at him , her eyes surprisingly soft over her stern mouth . " I am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deSnoo . " <p> The window was the only light in the dark room , and the mountains grew larger as the light failed . He sat there in his chair , considering the minutes they had left , knowing they would not be enough . He could feel the lassitude in his blood , his heart winding to its own conclusions . Consider the consequences of an hour 's meeting . Consider the consequences in the seasons changing , the slope of a hill and a slow-rolling truck . Or her being a woman and him a man and all the natural ordering of parenthood . Consider the consequences of love . <p> <p> By CLAIRE DAVIS <p>
