On the last day of our vacation in Paris , I was thinking that it 's better to be content at Our Lady of Perpetual Aluminum Siding than to feel disappointment at Notre-Dame Cathedral . John , sitting beside me during the Spanish-language service , held my hand and stared down at the floor . He looked morose because the day had already failed to contribute the poignancy he demanded of our travels . I wondered if some people are naturally drawn to beauty , others to necessity . My sister has a son who pointed his baby hand , declaring objects beautiful as soon as he could speak . My aesthetic ledger contains many blank pages and is opened only under special circumstances . Its entries are for what I imagine beauty might be at a distance . On my bedroom wall as a child I had a travel poster of Portofino . My mother had placed it there because the glistening water and sandy winding path blended with my drapes . Her decorating concept was my touchstone for beauty . Finding myself in Portofino twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my Achilles tendon and the tingle of my skin as the sun pierced the back of my polo shirt . As hymns were sung and the collection plate passed , I reduced my philosophy to a slogan : it 's better to have seen Baudelaire 's drainpipe than to have mimed the house altogether . <p> Besides , some aesthetic notions can be dangerous . I read in the paper back home that a neighborhood teenager wanted to change his image by giving himself a mohawk . He asked his grandmother for an electric razor . When she was unable to find it , he stalked her around the house with a baseball bat , a Raskolnikov of New Wave style . The story was printed in the local crime blotter , but it seems more a cautionary tale about ardor . Until I read that story , I had n't thought much about a line in a poem that said , " Too much beauty / could detonate us . " Looking at John moping next to me , I wondered if too little beauty could produce the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house being around the corner from our yet inaccessible . He stormed around the bird market banging into cages , swearing under his breath . I suggested we visit Notre-Dame again , hoping its grimacing angels might offer commiseration . As we walked there , he thought of all the places we had n't seen in our travels . It was a list of startling variety with nuances of hope , resolve , and despair . It contained a Buddhist temple we were unable to locate on a remote mountain in Japan ; the shrine at Delos , unapproachable by boat in rough water ; London 's Highgate Cemetery , padlocked to visitors ; Freud 's house in Vienna , closed for remodeling . Later at a cafe he actually wrote out the list after ordering another espresso . Before I could remind him that we had been successful on other occasions , a goat had climbed a ladder set up on the sidewalk and his trainer was extending a red metal coin box in our direction . The goat wore a green Alpine hat and made me recall an out-of-context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago on Crete . <p> I reminded John that we 'd seen many sights . My list ranged from Apollinaire 's grave to locks of Keats 's hair to the birth of our own daughter . I thought I might jostle him into better cheer by adding that final intimate detail , but John was unwilling to be consoled . His list continued . It included the Pope at Yankee Stadium and Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park . When I told him that he did n't even like Simon and Garfunkel , he said that was beside the point . I looked at his troubled eyes and wondered why he took these disappointments personally . Someday , I worried , he might read a news story about trash dumped in space , say , " Look what they 've done to my galaxy ! " and jump out a window . <p> Now the street performer tied the goat to the ladder and took a little dog dressed like a clown out of a carrying case . The man was dressed in black tights that made his legs seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aged Chihuahua , categorically uninterested in the commands that the man delivered in increasingly loud , vehement French . I suggested to John that right now we were witnessing something memorable , fiance 's most inept dog trainer . Usually he would have laughed at that , but instead he described Baudelaire 's drainpipe in detail as if he were fixing it in his mind . <p> " Bronze , " he said . " A fish whose bead points downward and whose tail is soldered to the drainpipe itself . " <p> " I 'm not sure , " I answered , " that the fish is fumed upside down . Maybe the fish 's mouth is open , and the drainpipe emerges from it . I think I remember the tail curled in one direction or another at the bottom . " <p> He turned his face away from me and watched the man throw small embroidery troops over the dog 's neck . Then the men picked up the dog end tossed him onto the goat 's back . The dogs hind legs shook with tension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again , " John said and started off in the direction of Baudelaire 's corner . I followed him silently down the narrow lanes of l'Ile Saint-Louis . When we approached the entrance to our hotel , I told him I was going to take a nap . He looked at me wearily and said he 'd take a picture of the drainpipe since I was n't interested enough to join him . <p> I must have slept for a long time . I woke up in darkness and thought about a museum in Montreal where we'd. seen an exhibit of Rodchenko 's Futurist furniture , an aesthetic based on perceptual miscues . Chairs that resembled greyhounds seemed too fragile to sit on . I remembered a museum for children with a room that distorted perspective and how happily my nephew , the one who loved beauty , had sashayed up and down the slanting floor . <p> When John finally resumed , he did n't say a word . He 'd brought a sack filled with dinner items that he noisily unwrapped . He placed a tin of sardines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pentagon-shaped slab of bread . Next to it he placed two orange-yellow pears , a bottle of Bordeaux with a swan on the label , and some chocolates with hazelnuts from Italy . Someone should have painted it all before I bit into a slightly unripe pear . <p> " Did you see Baudelaire 's drainpipe ? " I asked him . <p> " Remember that bus ride in the Philippines ? " he asked . That called me back to our days in the Peace Corps before Glenna was born . I was n't sure which bus ride he had in mind , though most were of the same character and duration : stifling , acrid , and endless . <p> " Which exact ; one ? " I asked , tearing a corner of crusty bread from the loaf . <p> " The one with the chickens and pigs and the man who bumped his head on the roof of the bus when we went over a rut in the road . " <p> " Not really , " I said . <p> " The man 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . You were irate . You do n't remember that ? " <p> " It all sounds familiar , but I ca n't say that I actually remember . " <p> " Then my afternoon 's been a waste , " he said , shrugging his shoulders . He speared a sardine with surprising ferocity . " Why do I need to take photos when I can tell you anything , and you 'll believe me ? " <p> When we got back to New York a week later , the photos we 'd taken in Paris were developed . There was Pere LaChaise with Apollinaire 's flower-strewn grave . There I was our tour guide , whose radiant copper-colored eyes shone like new pennies . There I was , smiling in the bird market on that ill-fated Sunday . Among the photos I saw no evidence of Baudelaire 's drainpipe , but I decided not to reopen the case . <p> A few weeks later we were dining with Glenna and Ramon . It 's hard to believe that my daughter 's a married woman with a baby of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fingers when Glenna asked him how we 'd liked Paris . John said I 'd been satisfied enough , having lower standards than he does . Glenna wondered whether the hotel was n't up to par . <p> Preparing to respond , he handed back the baby , and I said , " Dad means Baudelaire 's home . We missed the weekly tour by fifteen minutes . We did see his drainpipe , though , and it was lovely . " <p> John snorted with disdain . I wondered how I could love this man . <p> To make matters worse , Glenna started laughing . " Remember Melville 's toolshed and Emily Dickinson 's parking meter ? Did n't we drive two hundred miles to see them ? " <p> " Quiet , you 'll wake the baby , " John told Glenna . <p> " The baby 's awake , " Glenna said , coaxing Aaron 's head under her blouse to nurse him . <p> John aimed his body away from Glenna and me , adjusted his glasses and spoke . " Women do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a confidential whisper . <p> " Who was Baudelaire ? " Ramon asked . <p> I was just brushing my teeth before bed when John flashed a photo in front of my eyes . He moved it into and out of my field of vision so quickly that I was n't sure what I 'd seen . " What was that ? " I asked him . <p> " Baudelaire 's drainpipe , " he answered , voice registering triumph . <p> " Then you were right about the fish ? " I asked him . <p> " Nope , " he said smugly , " but at least I cared enough to do the necessary research . " <p> The next morning John told me that he was sick of traveling . He thought it would be better for us to stay home in the future . He pointed at an island-shaped place on the kitchen ceiling where the plaster needed repair . He gestured outside to our crumbling staircase veined with weeds and fledgling trees . <p> I looked up from the garden catalogue I 'd been reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Green tulips . Do n't they remind you of something ? " John looked over my shoulder and said no . I was thinking of the color of old bronze , the color the drainpipe fish had become over a century of weather and change . <p> <p> By Maxine Chernoff <p>
