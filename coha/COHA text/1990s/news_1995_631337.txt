<p> From a scheming standpoint , the Bears ' defense has been the Sybil of NFL defenses this year , always showing a new face , forever reflecting a different mood . It has been by design , as coaches have struggled and scrapped to show a different look every week that might help overcome personnel deficiencies . <p> It is time for the schizophrenia to stop . The defense we saw Sunday in a 16-10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals is the defense we should see more of . <p> It hardly resembled the defense that opposing offenses have come to know and love this season . And though its impact was n't great enough to win the game , the impact of a new defense could have implications for the rest of the season . <p> The difference in the defense was an aggressive front . The Bears played line games on virtually every down . They probably stunted more in this game than they had in all of their previous games combined . <p> Most of their stunts were two-man games , with a lineman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the loop goes around two teammates , are riskier . <p> The stunts kept the Bengals guessing and thinking . <p> Before Sunday , the Bears were more concerned with gap control than wreaking havoc . Previous opponents knew where the Bears would line up and how they would rush the passer . That way was n't working . <p> " We had been pretty much stuck in one spot for weeks , " defensive end Alonzo Spellman said . " If a team knows where you line up play after play , they know how to attack you and what plays to run . <p> " If you 're moving and stunt , one time here , one time there , they never can get a key on what you 're out to do . The opportunity to move was a great decision by the coaches . It paid off . " <p> The movement did n't manifest itself in sacks ( the Bears ' only sack came out of a three-man pass rush ) , mostly because Bengals quarterback Jeff Blake got rid of the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the stunts and games resulted in a lot of pressure and backfield penetration that queered quite a few Bengals runs . <p> " It confused them a little bit , " defensive tackle Jim Flanigan said . " It caused them to bounce around inside . " <p> There were two reasons Bears defensive coaches decided to get more aggressive against the Bengals . <p> One was that the Bengals ' running game is pathetic . Even when the stunting resulted in gaps wide enough for mobile homes to fit through , the Bengals could n't capitalize . <p> " Certain teams allow you to stunt , some do n't , " Bears defensive coordinator Bob Slowik said . " Against Barry Sanders , you ca n't do it . He 'll find the open gap . If a guy does n't turn around on a twist , he 's through the gap . " <p> The other reason was that the Bears matched up well with the Bengals . Cincinnati 's starting offensive line averages 6-6 and 300 pounds ; the Bears ' starting defensive linemen are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Additionally , the Bears ' defensive line is quick and athletic ; the Bengals ' offensive line is lumbering and plodding . Playing head-up against such a line is a prescription for defeat . <p> Nowhere was the matchup more pronounced than at right defensive tackle and left offensive guard , where 6-1 , 280-pound Chris Zorich lined up over 6-8 , 320-pound Scott Brumfield . The size difference worked to Zorich 's advantage for the most part because he was able to use his quickness and leverage to get around Brumfield . <p> " I have problems with people closer to my size , like ( Vikings guard ) Randall McDaniel , " Zorich said . " But if we can use stunts and work with our quickness , we can have people come up with big plays . " <p> One way the Bengals dealt with the Bears ' gaming was by throwing screen passes . They threw eight , more than the Bears have seen in any game this year . Because the Lions and Packers also had some success with screens against the Bears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the season , even though the Bears dropped the Bengals for losses on three screens . <p> " We were getting a little pass rush , so they figured the screens would slow us down , " Slowik said . <p> Getting a little pass rush is better than getting none at all.PRPKOL11P$ PAPER:CHICAGO SUN-TIMES <p> The hype already has begun . <p> Imari Sawyer , a 13-year-old eighth-grader at Bethel Christian School on Chicago 's West Side , is being touted as " the next Isiah Thomas " and " another Kiwane Garris " and " the best young prospect since Ronnie Fields " by veteran basketball observers . <p> The next Isiah Thomas ? Was n't William Gates of " Hoop Dreams " fame supposed to fill that role ? <p> Sawyer , a 5-11 point guard , is the latest grade-school phenom to surface in the city . He follows such wunderkinds as Rashard Griffith , Antoine Walker , Prentis Baker , Garris and Fields , all of whom developed in high school and proved they could handle the pressure of going from puberty to prodigy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . Thomas ' brother says Imari is better than <p> Isiah was at the same age . At Sawyer 's season opener , 16 high school coaches were in the bleachers . After seeing him perform in a national tournament in Florida last summer , Louisville coach Denny Crum called . <p> Imari has a key advantage . His father also is his coach . Terry Sawyer , a teacher at Bethel , was an all-city guard at Lindblom in 1978 . He played against Mark Aguirre and Terry Cummings . He knows what it takes to be a big-time basketball player . And he knows his son has enormous potential . <p> " I am baffled by what people are saying , but I am not afraid of it , " Terry Sawyer said . " It overwhelms me that he is as good as he is . He can step on the court and he does n't have to score a point and you know he is on the floor . He is a great ballhandler and a great passer . He has great court sense . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and AAU coaches and talent scouts who have seen Imari agree with his father 's evaluation . In an AAU game , he loosened a teammate 's braces with a Quinn Buckner-like pass the youngster did n't anticipate . <p> Although Imari plays at a private school that numbers only 75 students between the fifth and eighth grades , he has been exposed to good competition . He was all-tournament at the 1993 state Lutheran tournament and MVP in 1994 . He was all-tournament at the national Lutheran tournament in 1993 and 1994 . Last season , he led his Waukegan team to the Youth Basketball Association title . <p> " I know I have to prove myself every time I step on the court , " Imari said . " I know if I do n't play well , people will say something different . So I do n't pay attention ( to the hype ) . All I say is thank you . <p> " I try to block out the coaches who are at my games because I do n't want to try to do things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year our goals are to win the state and national titles . My personal goal ? To average a triple double and be MVP at the national tournament . " <p> At the moment , the Sawyers are " investigating " high school pro <p> grams in the city and suburbs , public and private , looking for the perfect fit where Imari will be comfortable , obtain a good education and be well prepared for college . <p> " We have seen almost every major program at a time when they did n't know we were there , " Terry Sawyer said . " We sit behind the coach and listen to what he says and how he handles himself with his players and listen to his strategy . " <p> On Jan. 13 , Imari will be tested for admission to Catholic schools . He might choose De La Salle . Meteor coach Tom White was Terry Sawyer 's backcourt mate at <p> Lewis University . Imari also will attend an upcoming open house at St. Joseph in Westchester . Whitney Young and Simeon are public school options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but worries about academics . <p> " I want to play for a coach like my father , " Imari said . " My dad is a screamer . He takes time with players to get his point across . He screams to get our attention , not to embarrass . He teaches me about passing and keeping everybody involved and keeping my head in the game . And he still beats me one-on-one . " <p> Maybe Denny Crum can use a 35-year-old guard , too . @x After a 34-year career as a public elementary school teacher , my mother will hang up her erasers at the end of the academic year in June . By handing the superintendent a simple , one-page , typed note , Jean Brandon effectively made her most important retirement decision : when to retire . I asked her why she decided to retire this year , when 401(k) balances -- including hers -- are falling through the floor . Why not last year or next year ? " The whole time you were growing up , I always had to bring work home and give attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be able to do the things I have n't been able to do because I was so busy working . " It 's a common reason to retire . Less common is that my mother is fortunate enough to get a pension and retiree health insurance until Medicare kicks in when she 's 65 . Workers without these two valuable benefits often need to work until they qualify for Social Security and Medicare . And given that the stock market fell 56 percent between Sept. 30 , 2007 , and March 6 , 2009 ( causing a $3.4 trillion drop in retirement account balances ) , baby boomers are facing increased pressure to work longer . That 's especially true for those who have only a 401(k) or an IRA retirement plan . Even before the recession began , Americans should have been considering the possibility that they might have to work past the average retirement age of 63 . Longer life expectancies mean you will need more dough for retirement . And now , it will take the typical 55-year-old employee two extra years in the workforce simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting firm Hewitt Associates . Other studies have come up with similar numbers . The Employee Benefit Research Institute calculated that employees with between 20 and 29 years on the job will have to work an extra year and 10 months to neutralize retirement account losses . If workers panic and pull their remaining cash out of the market , it will take even longer for them to recover : two years and four months , according to EBRI . Continued employment allows seniors to save more and reduce the number of years over which their savings must be spread . There are also valuable increases in Social Security check amounts for each year a worker delays claiming Social Security between ages 62 and 70 . Social Security is calculated based on your 35 highest earning years in the workforce . Each year you work in your 60s replaces a lower earnings year from your 20s in the calculation , assuming you make more money now than you did in your 20s . Benefit payouts further increase by approximately 7 to 8 percent for each year you delay claiming between ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also increase the dollar amount of your annual cost-of-living increases . Health watch . It 's also often worth it to try to provided retiree health benefits in 2008 , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey , and only 4 percent of small firms offer them . The average cost of premiums for retirees under age 65 with employer-provided coverage is $13,308 a year , according to a Towers Perrin survey . Those without employer-subsidized plans will generally pay even more , especially if they have health problems . That 's if they can even get coverage . But not everyone gets to choose his or her retirement date . Retirement is also something that can happen while you 're making other plans . Far too many Americans find themselves unexpectedly retired because of job loss , health problems , or the need to care for frail relatives . These forced retirees often struggle to find new employment that pays somewhere near their former salary . The unemployment rate for adults age 65 and older was 6.8 percent in February 2009 , the highest level ever recorded . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on finding a new job . Retirement offers the possibility of waking up to days that can be filled however you wish , but it also means you 'll be permanently separated from the income that has sustained you since you struck out on your own . Although working during the traditional retirement years does n't sound like much fun , an income stream provides a valuable sense of security that can be lost when you leave the workforce . Even a pension and health insurance have not freed my mother of her money worries . " I have moments of thinking , ' What the hell have I done ? ' " she says . " I have n't been able to sleep at night because I am afraid that I wo n't have enough money to live and because I have n't paid off my mortgage . " So she will teach summer school and substitute teach for a few years -- in other words , the fun stuff without the paperwork . See , work in the retirement years does n't have to feel like work .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
