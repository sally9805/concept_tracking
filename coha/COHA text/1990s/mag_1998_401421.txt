COMMON SENSE SAYS never volunteer to be camp cook . Few responsibilities carry graver consequences . Yet not many jobs are actually simpler or win you higher praise-if you keep a poker face and follow these directions . 1 . Volunteer . Nobody else will . So you 'll relieve them of an onerous task and win popularity points . But do n't stop there ; casually double the stakes . Offer , reluctantly , to do the provisioning and the cooking . Your companions will look at you like you 're crazy . Now you have them just where you want them . You 've just snagged the softest berth in camp . As cook , you 're better fed than anybody else and get the choicest morsels first . You also get full ownership of the warmest , driest place in camp , out of the wind and closest to the fire . And no one , as generations of lumberjacks and cowboys will attest , messes with the camp cook . 2 . Do the provisioning dance . You will , of course , loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Provisioning a party of three for three days , when every ounce must be carried , seems an almost certain recipe for culinary disaster . In truth , it takes about half an hour to pluck everything you need off the shelves of your local grocery store . Forget Vienna sausages , white bread , porkand-beans : these will reveal you 're not really a cook at all . Pluck wisely . 3 . Remember the critical four S 's . Beyond light weight and easy preparation , four things are crucial to making your reputation as a great camp cook : sight , sound , smell , and surprise . They will do most of the hard work . 4 . Start with appetizers . Not that you need them , but that 's the whole point . It 's the surprise that counts . Slip them into your pack . Tell no one . Produce them casualty , almost apologetically , as something to hold everyone over while you attend to larger matters . For this , you need not do more than open a can or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Typical backwoods fare like sardines and kippers will show a lack of imagination . Three unexpected , but equally easy-to-find appetizers , work to perfection : Smoked trout . In tins like sardines , but much better . Presentation is everything , so arrange on a bed of balsam , golden oak leaves , hydrilla , or whatever suits your fancy . Two tins will be enough to stimulate three appetites . Photograph // Smoked oysters . The giantsized ones . Admittedly an acquired taste , but like caviar ( which you might also consider ) , well worth the price . Take two tins . Pistachios . Inexplicably , some people will squeamishly refuse to partake of trout or oysters . Beware of them on future trips . They are almost certainly devotees of Vienna sausages and should be avoided . But an 8-ounce bag of pistachios will quiet them . 5 . Slosh ' em with soup . Besides rehydrating outdoorsmen , hot soup raises the body 's core temperature , boosts spirits , and holds appetites at bay until dinner 's ready . Instant chicken noodle soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but fret not . Nothing equals it for quickness and simplicity of preparation . Plus , it keeps everyone busy stirring and seasoning their own portion ( again , liberating the cook ) . It does n't dirty any pots and provides a liberal foundation of boiling water for dinner . For a party of three , take 12 packets . They weigh almost nothing , so pack varieties . 6 . Impress with entrees . Main courses are the crucible of the refrigerator-less camp cook 's problem . Supper 's all they 're really waiting for . The following courses are guaranteed to satisfy : Dirty Rice . It 's simple , spicy , and plentiful . Break up one pound of sausage in a frying pan : whole hog or precooked links will keep a day , perhaps two if sunk in a stream . Let it spit ( sight ) , sizzle ( sound ) , and exude a wonderful aroma ( smell ) . Do this more slowly than necessary . It 'll convince everyone that you 're actually cooking ( which , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . Top off the boiling water from the soup . You wo n't have to fetch it yourself ; somebody else will . Toss in an 8-ounce packet of long-grain yellow rice : it comes already seasoned ( for which you can take credit ) and its color ( sight again ) will likely be a surprise . Drain rice and stir in sausage , grease and all . Pepper liberally . Let each add Tabasco to taste . Serves four and dirties only two pots which , as cook , you wo n't be obligated to clean . Second Night Carbonara . The second night 's dinner is a test . Everybody will be twice as hungry and twice as observant as the night before . Finely chop up half of a hardcased salami ( the other half furnished sandwiches for lunch ) . Remember : it 's the little , unexpected things that win over your diners in the woods . Dig deep in your supermarket or butcher shop and pack along an aromatic Italian Oldani or woodsy-tasting Cacciatorini : It 'll make all the difference . Dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of cloves of your secret weapongarlic-and rub it in the skillet . Saute the onions and garlic in margarine until they 're brown , add the salami , and heat gently . The pungent scent of garlic alone will rivet your companions and alert them that some real cooking 's going on . Stir in two 1-ounce tins of tomato paste and a half cup of water . Shake in a pouch of dry spaghetti seasoning . Simmer . Shave in some aged parmesan ( which also helped furnish lunch ) . Call for some more wood or water at this point . You do n't need it , but it adds to the anticipation . In a pot , again containing the remaining hot water from the soup , boil 1 pound of vermicelli or angel hair pasta , the thinnest pasta you can find . It must not , under any condition , be spaghetti or the whole presentation 's ruined . Make a big deal out of salting and peppering the water . Drain , serve , and ladle the carbonara and sauce on top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plates . Again : only two pans have been used . Preparation , cooking time , and clean-up is minimal ; and everyone 's eaten heartily . Nantahala Stew . Preparing the third night 's meal is tantamount to the camp cook 's bar exam . By then everything fresh is likely gone . The attractions of occupying a freezing tree stand or climbing a mountain for two hours has dimmed . Fortunately , you 're prepared . The one thing you did do in advance of the trip was to make a mess of beef jerky . Not that miserable , storebought variety , but real jerky : a flank steak or London broil you partially froze ( say for an hour ) , sliced 1/4-inch thick and marinated in Worcestershire sauce ( for another 3 hours or overnight ) , then slowbaked ( on warm , say 140 degrees ) for 6 or 7 hours in the oven . This , and two large potatoes you 've held in reserve , are your ingredients . Boil a pot of water and dice in the potatoes . Add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , more for color than anything else . Add a packet of freeze-dried corn , a packet of instant brown gravy mix , and another packet of instant pepper sauce mix . Shred the jerky and toss it in . The stew should be ready when it 's thick and rich enough for a spoon to stand in . Serve hot with English muffins , which keep longer than bread , to sop up the gravy . Serves four , usually with ample leftovers . In the afterglow , around the campfire , you will not reveal any of your ingredients . You will merely say it 's an old , old recipe that takes a lot of time and trouble . The next time out , you 'll add some dried chilies to it , substitute turkey gravy for brown gravy mix , and present it as Brazilian Campfire Stew <p>                     @x APRIL 1865 <p> They came out of the darkness , riding lean , hungry horses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shotgun in the cab , but then relaxed . The riders were Reb cavalry , not goddamned bluecoats . He could tell by their slouch hats , the mishmash of uniforms and weapons , and those big CS belt buckles gleaming in the engine 's headlight . The officer who appeared to be in charge rode right up to the locomotive . The others slowed to a walk and spread out in a fan around the train 's guard detail , who were lounging in the grass beside the tracks while the engine took on water . The riders were greeting the men with soft drawls and questions about what was going on up there in Richmond city . <p> The officer wore the insignia of a major , and he tipped his hat to the engineer with his left hand while holding the reins close down to the saddle with his right . He was wearing a dirty white duster that concealed the lower half of his body . <p> " Major Prentice Lambert , at your service , suh , " he declared . He had a hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This the documents train ? " <p> The engineer said yes , a little surprised that the major knew . There were only four cars behind the engine and its tender , three of them passenger cars stuffed to the windows with boxes of official records from the various government departments up in Richmond . The twenty-man guard detail rode in the fourth car , but they were all disembarked for a smoke break and calls of nature . The guards , who were an odd mixture of old men , teenagers , and even some walking wounded from the trenches at Petersburg , seemed relieved to see Confederate cavalry . <p> The major nodded , as if the engineer 's answer were hugely significant . The engine puffed a shot of steam from the driver cylinder , spooking the major 's horse sideways , but his rider held him firmly . <p> " Any more trains behind you ? " the major asked , shifting his reins to his left hand as the horse danced around . <p> The engineer shook his head . " We heard ol ' Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't nothin ' comin ' down thisaway that I know of . Jig 's ' bout up in Richmond . " <p> " All right , then , " the major said . He raised the big Colt Dragoon he 'd been holding down beside his saddle horn , pointed it at the engineer 's belly , and fired . <p> The engineer sat down hard on the steel grate of the engine cab , the wind knocked clean out of him and this awful , ripping feeling in his guts . He grasped his midsection with both hands and felt the blood streaming . He was dimly aware of more shooting now , as that arc of cavalrymen also opened fire , shooting down the stunned soldiers where they sat in the grass or leaned against trees , all their weapons still back on the train . He bent over to look down at his middle , lost his balance , tumbled off the engine steps onto the cinder bed , and then rolled into the grass . His knees stung where he 'd hit the track bed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of that long , cool grass against his cheek . His middle was going cold now , and his legs were buzzing with pins and needles . <p> He looked back up at the train , his vision shrinking into a redhazed tunnel . He saw a single white face at the nearest window in the front car , a young face , no more than a kid , maybe fifteen , sixteen . One of the guards ? He tasted salt in the back of his throat , and it was becoming really hard to get a breath of air . <p> Why had n't that kid gotten off the train ? What was he doing in there among all those boxes , while his comrades outside were being slaughtered like beeves ? <p> One of the horsemen saw the kid 's face and surged his horse forward , his black cap-and-ball pistol pointing at the window . The engineer heard the major 's voice call out , " No . Not him . Leave that one be . " <p> The horseman reined up . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right here when it was supposed to be , were n't it ? " <p> " Yeah , but you said , now . No goddamned witnesses . " <p> " There wo n't be , " the major said , getting down off his horse , " but I need to know one more thing . " <p> Then the engineer heard the other horseman swear . He realized he 'd been spotted , eavesdropping on their conversation . He tried to crawl up the bank , trying to get under the locomotive , but his limbs had turned to rubber . He thought he heard the major say , " Oh , goddammit , " and then a bolt of lightning exploded in his head and he was gone to see the Baby Jesus . <p> Excerpted from NIGHTWALKERS by P. T.
