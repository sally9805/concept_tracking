<p> Skagway , Alaska-Every Monday night , Alaskans gather around their televisions to watch " Northern Exposure " and debate the delicate question it begs : Are we that weird ? <p> After all , the network TV program set in Alaska depicts a village of eccentrics who inhabit a spiritual bush country somewhere between Mayberry and Twin Peaks . The fictional town of Cicely is the kind of place where the disc jockey quotes Sartre , the men streak naked down Main Street and frozen corpses are always popping up . The 49th state could n't be that bizarre , could it ? <p> " Sit down . I 've got a frozen corpse story for you . " <p> Scott Logan pulls his whiskered smirk a little closer . Perched at the window table of the Red Onion Saloon , the ferry mechanic means to illustrate that truth - at least in the Alaskan panhandle town of Skagway - is stranger than television . <p> " A few years back , " he says , " our city manager died at his desk . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a morgue , so we had to improvise . We threw him in the pickup , took him to the supermarket and put him in the freezer . When we came back with the casket , he would n't fit . . . " <p> He pauses and sips . <p> " His arm had flopped out to the side and frozen . It took several men to crack it back in place . " <p> It 's easy to see why Mr. Logan loves " Northern Exposure " ; Cicely seems normal to him . But his opinion is far from unanimous here . <p> Alaskans have deeply mixed emotions about the top-ranked , Emmy- winning show that is doing so much to form their state 's image . Some protest that it makes the place out to be a freezer full of human snowflakes . One newspaper letter writer fretted that the show is doing for Alaska what " Dukes of Hazzard " did for the South , and that ai n't pretty . <p> " People get very defensive about it , " says Mary Pignalberi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting into a spirited discussion about " Northern Exposure " at the finish line of the Iditarod dog-sled race . " This woman was saying that the show makes America think we 're odd , and as she was talking , a dog sled came across the bay carrying a man in an easy chair . " <p> Even odder , this scene did n't end the discussion . <p> Show drew Alaskans ' ire <p> " Northern Exposure " tripped the provincial nerve with its first episode two years ago . The premise is strictly lox-out-of-water . Joel Fleischman , a whiny New Yorker , arrives in Alaska to fulfill his obligation under a state program that had paid his tuition . He expects to be assigned to Anchorage or Fairbanks . The state sticks him in Cicely , a town so isolated that the local storekeeper does n't know what he means when he asks for a bagel . <p> Never mind that many Alaskans are bagel-deprived . ( " I remember when our store got them , " says Bob Ward of Skagway . " I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many in the state reared up like threatened grizzlies to defend their sophistication . The Anchorage Daily News called the program " not interesting , not funny and not at all real . " Tom Bodett , the Alaska humorist who does those folksy Motel 6 radio commercials , advised people to flip off their sets . <p> Fat chance . " Northern Exposure " has become one of the state 's top- ranked programs . In Fairbanks last winter , it was grabbing more than 60 percent of viewership . <p> Sometimes , it seems , people are tuning in just to wag their fingers . Fact-checking " Northern Exposure " has become one of Alaska 's favorite pastimes . During a blooper-spotting contest sponsored by an Anchorage TV station , more than 2,000 viewers responded with enough nitpicking about flora and fauna to fill an issue of National Geographic . <p> The prize was a trip to the set - in Roslyn , Wash. , 70 miles east of Seattle . That explains a lot about whatever PR problem " Northern Exposure " has . In a state where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are miffed that the producers chose to set up shop hundreds of miles away in an impostor town . As a popular T-shirt puts it , " Where the ? @ ! # ! @ ! is Cicely , Alaska ? " <p> Just a state of mind <p> Before the series began , producer Matthew Nodella did drive around Alaska scouting locations . He cautioned that the shortage of skilled technicians made it unlikely that the program would be shot in the state . Besides , geographical precision did n't really matter , he explained . " It has always been our idea to portray Alaska as a state of mind . " <p> And there 's no better place to find that consciousness than Skagway , the old Klondike Gold Rush port that some people ( most of them in Skagway ) say inspired Cicely . Mr. Nodella spent an afternoon here scribbling notes and snapping photos of the saloons and shops that make Broadway , the main drag , resemble the set of a Wild West movie . <p> Skagway is really two towns . During the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlaws and prospectors who flocked to the place around the turn of the century . During the winter , the population dwindles to a hardy 700 and cabin fever descends over them as surely as gray skies . The psychic toll is apparent in the way villagers celebrate spring thaw ; they throw an annual " Windfest " ( as in gale- force ) , the featured event being a competition to see who can toss a chain saw the farthest . <p> " You have to be a little odd to live here , " says Oscar Selmer , who should kno w . The retiree spent months last year measuring by yardstick the valley that shelters Skagway . It was the same distance as the last time he measured it 50 years ago . He was relieved to know that the mountains were n't closing in . <p> " Northern Exposure " has many fans in Skagway . It might have more , but like so many everyday things in Alaska , finding the program is a more complicated task than it is in the Lower 48 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 p.m. on a feed from Detroit . Everyone else has to wait until Friday to view it four days after the rest of the nation on the Rural Alaska Television Network ( RATNET ) . <p> Skagway , Cicely similarities <p> However they see it , Skagway residents discern certain parallels between their town and Cicely : <p> Skagway has a disc jockey almost as spacey as K-Bear 's Chris in the Morning . People all over town can recite his sign-on : " This is still Don Corwin , broadcasting live from Skagway , Alaska , directly over the center of the Earth . " <p> Skagway has a bar where everyone crosses paths like they do at The Brick . At the Red Onion , the macho clientele sometimes plays a game called Slap . Two people stand toe to toe and take turns slapping each other until someone falls . Buckwheat Donahue , 250 pounds of beard and brawn , is man enough to admit that he once lost to a woman . <p> Skagway even has a moose like the one that strolls through Cicely during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moose is dead . When his carcass washed up in the harbor , someone towed it into town and deposited it on a woman 's car with a forklift . It was her birthday . The antlered head now occupies an honored place on a wall overlooking the pool table in the Red Onion . Bloatwinkle , they call him . <p> But there 's one thing Cicely has that Skagway lacks : Dr. Fleischman . A circuit doctor makes regular visits , but the rest of the time , people who need non-emergency medical care have to take the ferry to Juneau , 90 miles south , or drive to Whitehorse , 100 miles north across the snowy peaks of the White Pass . <p> Clearly , Skagway needs Dr. Fleischman . Just as clearly , Skagway does n't want him . When townspeople tune in the season premiere today , you can bet that the loudest back talk will be reserved for the fussy little physician who once complained that he was marooned among psychotic rednecks . <p> " That 's the most unrealistic thing about ' Northern Exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
