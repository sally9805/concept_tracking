Down where it is dry and wild , across the border where the bad guys went when the sheriff was after them , there is a hilltop . On it live a man and a woman , both expatriates , who drink , give orders to Mexicans , pretend to work . Although they have a blue swimming pool and get all their clothes washed and ironed for them , they complain that they are poor and that they miss the culture up north . They ca n't go back , though . They are runaways . Escapees . <p> Ed and Grace have a story about themselves , the way every prison inmate does : how something unfair put them there . They think they are romantic , tragic figures , exiled as on Elba . They picture themselves as enlightened barons bringing civilization , opportunity , and kindness to the brown-skinned . <p> It would be more accurate , however , to say that Ed and Grace are outlaws , thoroughly bad and incorrigible . Of course they do n't look it ; with their soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless and benign , there among the flowers , hiding out . But the posse will unmask them . The posse is coming down after them from the States . It consists of Senta and her brother , Benny . <p> This is n't a strong alliance . They entered upon it with trepidation and considerable mistrust , for Benny and Senta have n't gotten along for years , maybe never . They avoid each other on holidays , phone rarely , are acid and careless of feelings <p> when they speak . But the last time they saw Ed was ten years ago ; he and Grace came north for tests on his liver . He bought them both a steak in the hotel dining room ; then they had one lunch apiece alone with him . Now they are afraid their father will die unvisited , and in their mutual need for one last try to get him to come clean about what he and Grace did , they have agreed to call for plane tickets and send a telegram to that phoneless , guileless mountaintop to announce their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarcastic ; it said : " Esteemed father , could you tolerate a brief encounter with your children ; send yes or regrets , Senta and Benny . " We gave the dates , too . The telegram back said : " By all means ; bring serpents ' teeth , switchblades , Ed and Grace . " Our family adored this sort of nasty literate banter . For example : When I saw Benny at the airport , waiting by the ticket counter in a heavy tweed suit he would boil in once we arrived in Mexico City , I was tempted to attack , something Thoreau-like : Beware of new clothing . I restrained myself . But I was aware of a rising anger at the length and thinness of his neck , his tallness in general , inherited from Ed . I hugged him briefly , all rough nap and spine , and I moved away to check in . <p> " All ready for the big reunion ? " he said , slumping against the counter . Benny has always had terrible posture . <p> " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 've been rereading Lear , " he said . " I think Ed casts us as the Goneril and Regan of his declining years . " <p> " In that case we 'll get our revenge , he 'll go mad and wander on the mesa or something , " I said . " Let 's go have junk food . " <p> We sat dolefully at a sticky plastic table , not speaking much , until our flight was called . On the plane , Benny had to fold into the narrow seat and he stuck out like a wire hanger , all angles , his elbow catching people as they passed . I pretended we were n't together . <p> " Did you talk to Mom ? " I asked after a while , checking up on him . Of course , I had been the one to break it to our mother that we were flying south . Benny has zero contact with her . But I 'd insisted that he at least call her . <p> " Uh-huh . For a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant . " So ? " I said . <p> " She said only completely perfect things , like she understands and it 's important and we 're still his children after all . " <p> In actuality , we both knew , our mother would rather see us in hell than in Mexico visiting Ed and Grace . Especially Grace . <p> Grace deserves a mention here , or maybe deserves is the wrong word . Although she is grandmotherly age now , twenty years ago <p> she was a youthful and seductive fiftyish woman who professed to be the best friend our family ever had . She taught Benny and me to speak Spanish , baked for birthdays , came on Christmas , lent clothes to our mother from her large and extensive wardrobe . She had a husband , but he was a lesser light . I would say that for five years or so , Grace dominated our lives . She was n't simply Ed 's sidekick . She was his evil genius . <p> The consequences of her badness became clear only after they absconded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before , she had been going on with her grieving , but was steady for us nonetheless ; she had been reading in bed when I went in to kiss her . She had taken a bath and smelled of gardenia . In the morning , Benny went in with some coffee and could n't wake her . He kept me out of the bedroom but I could see him through the door : skinny in his striped bathrobe , phoning the ambulance . I glimpsed a bit of his pajama top and noticed that at sixteen he had hair on his chest , stubble on his chin , he looked like a man . <p> A clinical depression was diagnosed and Mom was incarcerated in a hospital supposedly too threatening for a twelve-year-old to visit . But bars and straitjackets could not be worse , I thought , as I passed the next years in the bookless apartment of Aunt Martha , Mom 's sister , who put plastic on her furniture to protect the upholstery and did n't understand irony . Benny was away at boarding school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every time he seemed taller , too tall , ugly , in fact , and more emphatically a stranger . <p> I grew , meanwhile , into a sad , competent woman , destined to teach English to tenth graders , terrorizing them with Poe and Dickens . ( Parents complain I am cruel and demanding . ) Benny was , annoyingly , literary as well . After graduation he began to affect string ties and cowboy boots and made an instant success writing potboilers with a Civil War background . <p> Since all his many research trips , including this one , were surely tax-deductible , he could have gotten an upgrade to a seat with more room in it . Beside me now he was wedged in , hanging out in the aisle , snoring loudly . I sat neatly , disdaining him , and soon I slept , too . <p> At Mexico City airport , Benny took off his suit jacket and we drank beer , the only safe thing , while we waited for our flight farther south . I do n't even like beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny had three , but given his height the effect was probably the same . The effect was grand . We started inventing bad black jokes about Ed and Grace and speculating about their sex life at this stage of the game . Even the sight of the plane , not exactly a Piper Cub but small enough , did n't faze us . We laughed at it , persuaded that anything carrying us to our predestined and fateful meeting with Ed and Grace could n't possibly crash ; would the gods deprive themselves of such a rich entertainment ? <p> The flight was what they like to call turbulent . All they served was more beer . At one point we held hands in terror , hoping , I guess , to be close at the last . I prayed . Any soothing announcements by the pilot were in such rapid Spanish and so fraught with static that we could n't understand them . All we could see was worry on the Mexican faces around us , and an older American couple in madras and spectacles asked us if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he looks awkward , so they assume naively that he will be kind . <p> To tell you the truth , I think it was n't the turbulence or the beer that made us sick , but the prospect of seeing Ed and Grace again after so long . We gazed at each other greenly as we landed and staggered out down the ladder into roaring heat , looking I 'm sure like a pair of orphans ripe for a cool drink and , later , adoption . <p> Ed , but not Grace , met us . He looked so much like Benny , is what struck me first  --  then I realized it should be the other way around . I hugged him ; there was a whole history to the way I put my arms around his chest , his bent head . He and Benny kind of clasped and patted the way most men do , trying not to touch . <p> He wore a tucked and embroidered shirt over old seersucker pants from a suit I remembered . Espadrilles and a watch you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . " Grace is managing dinner , " he said by way of explaining her absence . I imagined her commanding a battalion of Mexican maids , all chopping , and as we waited for the bags he told us what we were going to eat : shrimps with remoulade sauce , chicken with chocolate , poached pears . His letters were always full of such details and when he and Grace traveled , they kept excellent records of their meals . <p> We got into the jeep and he started driving in a reckless fashion , glancing at me on his right and over his shoulder at Benny in the back seat . The talk was inconsequential , pointing out the new road that was supposed to be built but had n't been yet , a neighbor 's lavish garden , the shantytown with corrugated iron roofs , scratching chickens , thin goats and dogs and somber people watching the car sweep by . There were no tense silences , for Ed spoke fluently and noticeably without sarcasm . I thought he was afraid to be unkind , afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We wound up the hilltop to this hum , like a tune you 've heard over and over in the deep past . Benny and I were glad to let it be . It was fine to listen , sway , sleep . To sit in the arms of our <p> father 's voice was fine . <p> BENNY Ed looked old . Upsetting . Did n't help that we were besotted by beer in airport , stormy flight . Must have dozed off driving to the <p> house . <p> I knew they had staff , but this was imperial . Like a goddamned plantation , servants running around , taking our bags . Thought they 'd offer to unpack for us . But no . <p> Ed offered more alcohol . Declined . Went for nap . Senta had a drink with him . She 's no drinker . What 's she up to ? <p> Grace looked good . Youthful . She 's older than Ed , chronologically . Always was a fantastic cook . I think : Why have we hated her all these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . He and Senta were red and stupid at dinner . Grace and I exchanged looks . Because I am tall like Ed , everyone assumes we are alike . This is bullshit . Senta is the one . <p> She 's short but weak . Seizing her chances . She was flirting with him , for God 's sake . Grace looked miserable . <p> Next day was better . Senta told me sorry : It was the beer , then screwdrivers , then wine . Breakfast on terrace . Senta cool to Ed 's questions about toast , our plans for the day . Grace stony . Nice to me , though , plied me with strong tea . <p> Too hot to run . Went to pool for swim . Senta and I will go to Monte Alban , a ruin , later on when sun is weaker . Valley is something . Reminded us of valley our house overlooked when we were children , before the divorce . What a memory . Senta and I rolling down the hill . Tucked into our tree house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings , riding the dog . <p> " We were so free , " Senta said to the valley , not looking at me . " We were stupid , " I said . " We did n't see . " <p> " See what ? " <p> " The bad guys , " I said . " What was coming . " <p> I was the boy . So I had this knight idea . Spy the enemy . Protect Senta , protect Laura . Senta still calls her " Mom . " I have n't since that day . You find your mother half-dead , pills and vomit on the sheets , you 're on a first-name basis forever . <p> Senta got the worst of it , though . She had to stay , visit Laura , return letters unopened to Ed . I could get the hell out back to school . I decided to pretend I had no family . Other people 's parents got fond of me during holidays . I worked summers on a boat . There was no reason to go back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a kid and her tongue even then was by no means sweet . I had a sofa bed at Aunt Martha 's . <p> The point is , Ed and Grace did all that . It 's like a war . There 's some unlucky incident . An insult , an assassination . And it goes from there . No one can remember why . It just goes . <p> We borrowed the car ; Senta drove . The relief of not being with Ed and Grace made us giddy . We ridiculed Grace 's culinary obsessions , which included large pepper mills and orange juice squeezed from scratch by maids . Stopped in Oaxaca for drink , beer , of course . Main square is huge . Heavy trees . Lacy iron chairs . Children begging . Cathedral , which I skipped . Senta went in . She 's got religious lately . Reading Merton , C. S. Lewis . As I said , she takes her opportunities . <p> Road was hot and dusty . I hate heights . Did n't trust Senta on the curves . Held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesa . Flattened mountain , ruins on top . Great stone things , steep steps . Better than cathedral . A lot of climbing . Senta got footsore . Had to stop frequently . Could n't say , " Wear sneakers next time . " Could n't say , " Stop being so nice to Ed . " Conversation flagged . <p> On way back , got dark . Perilous descent on mountain road . Senta could n't figure out where lights turned on . Had to use turn signal . This confused other cars . Senta tense . As on plane , thought we might die . Said , " Do you forgive Ed ? " <p> She looked over at me , then back at road . " Of course not . Shut up . I 'm concentrating . " <p> I do n't forgive him . Even if he were expiring . He seems in rude health . No sign of an early demise . Why did we come ? <p> " That 's the turn , " I said to Senta . She pulled the car up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , reproachful . " Hell , we ca n't call if you have no phone , " I said . Senta shot me a look . Beer in Ed 's hand . Moon like cheese , creamy , rising over mountain . Grace offered crackers , soup , salts for Senta 's feet . <p> Our rooms adjoined . Through the wall I could hear the bed creak as she got into it . She sighed . Clink , the water glass , her reading glasses . I was in bed , covers up to chin . Snug as a bug in a rug . Hey , Senta , remember summer nights in the bunk beds on the porch laughing and laughing . Ed coming to admonish us . Remember . <p> Woke up at six . Purple dark . Smelled woodsmoke . Heard roosters . Senta was snoring and the mountaintops were covered with cloud . Got up and went out on terrace . Bare feet , cold stones . A neighbor 's yellow dog trotted up , stretched , snout searching me for food . No dawn yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing up ? " she said . <p> " I do n't know , " I told her . It 's true . <p> She yawned and put her fists in her eyes , rubbing . " We should go to town and call Mom today , " she said . <p> " Why ? " I said . I hate how she 's always making the piles equal : so much for Ed , so much for Laura . God forbid one of them should get more . <p> Senta did n't bother to answer . She got down on her knees to embrace the dog . Dogs are dearer to her than people . She says they are truer . I think she just wants to be adored . When she stood up , I saw that the dog 's tongue had left a wet streak on her nightgown . " Okay . We 'll call , " I said . She went back inside . The sky turned pink . I thought about Senta 's body . My shrink says all boys dream of sisters . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearned toward the house . It wanted Senta . <p> SENTA I swore I would n't compete with Benny . I mean , what 's the prize ? Life with Ed ? <p> But when I looked up at Ed and wanted to press my face against his shirt , something sent me back . Benny became the monster child , the enormous brother , and I was , comparatively , fair of face , full of grace full of shit . <p> This got especially intense the day after Benny and I went off on our own to Monte Alban . Neither of us slept . At breakfast he looked at me reproachfully and yet wolfishly , as if I was supposed to apologize or deliver an emotion he wanted . It made me uneasy . I veered away as if from a scar or a missing limb . I could n't look at him . Ed , of course , noticed nothing . Grace probably did , I saw her small , bright eyes taking in the aversion and not minding . The last <p> thing she wanted was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life on her doorstep and leaving her out . <p> " Ed , please get some lettuce for lunch , and more beer , " Grace said when our late breakfast was concluded and one of the maids , bad teeth and a crown of braids , was clearing the table . <p> He looked from Benny to me and back . He wanted a helper . I felt the thick and urgent desire to be first , and I said , " I 'll come . " <p> Benny shifted in his seat and growled , sort of . <p> " Unless , of course " I said , glancing at Benny , knowing I was safe . Ed was beaming . <p> " Do n't worry , " Benny said , tight . " I 'll read . " <p> Ed and I went off with a clutch of bright plastic carryalls . He handed me a long , sharp knife , and I bent to slice the ripe green heads of bibb close to the root . I cut three of them , heavy with dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and loaded the bags further with the brown bottles of cerveza Ed drank from eleven in the morning until bedtime . Grace drank only wine , and two large glasses of sherry every night before dinner . <p> I expected Benny to be sitting there waiting for us , looking petulant . Instead he was speaking to Dolores , the maid with the braids , as she washed breakfast dishes ; he knew a little Spanish from a book he once wrote , before his Civil War successes , about the Alamo . It was in diary form and represented the common soldier 's point of view , Mexican and Texan . <p> Ed joined in . God knows what they were babbling about . Ed 's own Spanish , even after all the years here , sounded like something produced by an earnest tourist : It would serve , it was diligently expressed , but the Midwestern cadence was unchanged , and so words came out flat and patient , almost unrecognizable . Grace , on the other hand , sounded as if she had been born to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny and I were regularly distressed , when we were little , by how much he stuck out , tall and slow , at brisk New England school events . <p> When we went into town later , I let Benny do the talking . Before , he had claimed to have forgotten all his Spanish and I had too easily believed him . It changed things , having him in charge . Then we had a fight in the Larga Distancia . This is an obscure and shabby storefront on a side street with four standup phone stations inside and an operator who will dial a number for you and charge the proper amount when the call is over . Benny did all the preliminary negotiations , but then he would n't speak to <p> Mom . I told her he was coming on and held the receiver out and he backed off , loitering outside until it was time to pay . It cost twenty dollars . <p> I raised my voice and the operator stared at the sound of unintelligible shouting . Benny slumped and shrugged and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he kept saying as we left . " Tough ! " I said , the teacher . " Too bad , that 's life , doing stuff you 'd rather not do . That 's adult . That 's reality . " <p> I was really cooking . I was enjoying myself . If I 'd had a lash , I could n't have been happier . <p> Benny never fought back , he froze up and hulked along . This was a pattern of long standing . Now he was walking a little ahead of me , head down , a bird searching for crumbs . He was signifying his hurt . This was my cue to make some conciliatory comment . I did n't . Instead , I pointed out that we had n't bought a present for Mom . " You made me forget , " I said to Benny as we went back to the car . " Because you do n't think of her . You do n't care . " <p> He did n't deny it but sat in the car like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window . <p> For some reason I ca n't explain , I did n't make the turn for Ed and Grace 's house but continued along the narrow , hot road toward more hills , unknown territory , and I saw Benny getting nervous , I saw him stiffen and sit up as he saw the unfamiliar landscape . " Stop , " he said . " Where are we going ? " <p> " What are you afraid of ? " I asked . " Bandits ? Cactus ? " <p> He shook his head . " We do n't know the way . " <p> " So ? " The road was getting more rutted , less cared-for , and the houses were poorer , the dogs skinnier . " It 's still light . We can get back . " I gunned the dusty old car and it racketed down a hill , past a burro bearing a load of corn husks five feet high . <p> Benny looked desperate . Then I remembered a gnarled sort of fairy tale from our childhood : He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only trees close together , nothing to be frightened of , and I always seemed to know where I was among them , even after dark . But Benny had been older when we moved to Massachusetts . What he was used to were wheatland vistas where nothing could hide . To him , the damp and tangle of the forest was a mystery he did not love , and he rarely went there alone . He had done it this time in despair because Mom had said or implied that he was a bean pole or a weakling or a milquetoast . He was ten maybe , eleven . <p> I rescued him , even though I was tiny . I was sturdy , Mom loved my self-reliance and my able little legs and rough , brown curly hair . When at six o'clock it became clear that Benny was missing , I went out calling for him and soon pushed my way into the woods where the deep green evergreens made everything that much darker . I had a flashlight . I heard Mom and Ed shouting and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged on with a kind of radar , my beam going straight to where Benny was , sitting on a stump , tears dried on his face and now hungry but too stubborn to go home . I do n't know if I hugged him . I was so much smaller and younger than he was ; he always got gruff in front of me and would n't admit his misery . But he came with me . His red plaid shirt and his wary eyes got trapped in the larger beam of Ed 's flash when we met our parents on the path . <p> Remembering , I stopped the car . Immediately the terror left Benny 's face . He slumped in the seat . " Why do you let me torture you ? " I said and got out and slammed the door . I looked at the harsh country . Nothing was moving . I was standing close to a cactus , I could see its spines and texture like the pores on a beloved ugly face , and I hit out at it , getting spikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got back in the car and sucked my hand . " You can have Ed , " I said . " Take him ! You deserve to get at least one parent . " <p> " Do n't be ridiculous , " he said , but he grinned . <p> " What a gift , huh ? " I said , laughing , too , and I turned the car around like a race driver and we bounced back down the road to Ed and Grace 's , released for a moment in euphoric truce . <p> BENNY Damn . Damn it . Big fight with Ed . Politics , of course . He 's so fucking naive . Workers of the world uniting . What irony . Grand house , servants , he 's practically a manor lord and he talks revolution . <p> I did n't say exactly that . I did point out that he was an expatriate Stalinist . Dangerously ignorant . Possibly senile . Ed did n't attack back . Just looked wounded . <p> When I was a kid , he swaddled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The paper smelled sour and they were usually about child heroes of the Resistance . ) Always making rabid speeches at me . He came in and sat on my bed but instead of singing me to sleep or telling a story , he would give me the business about the Bomb or the Cold War . Never did that with Senta . No compliment to her , probably . Only a girl , et cetera . <p> Ed and I raged on . Senta and Grace went silent . Highly uncharacteristic . Hausfrau behavior . They busied themselves with coffee . Chatted softly about recipes . Cast reproving looks our <p> way . It got late . The fire sank . Grace yawned and went to bed . Senta stuck there , fading . Whatever she 'd said on the road , she was n't willing to leave Ed to me . <p> There we were , the three of us . Seemed auspicious . Ripe for truth . No one spoke for a while . Then Ed said , " Well , you could be right . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the old orthodox Ed . <p> He shrugged and smiled . Weak . Sweet . " What do I know ? I read a lot . I try to be decent . Let 's go to bed . " <p> " But , wait , " I said . This was nothing to bite on . " I was mad . I 'm sorry . " <p> " Forget it . " <p> How could I forget it ? The next day was our last day . Nothing had been done . Nothing had been said . Ed and Grace and Senta were pretending that everything was swell and normal . Whitewash . Cover-up . Take down those wanted-man posters . Come home , Billy the Kid , all is forgiven . War 's over . Lost your life , but hey , someone has to make sacrifices . <p> Also : Senta could n't stop groaning about the present for Laura she had n't bought . Even to Grace . Jesus .

( Who , incidentally , stood by looking fierce . This was not her idea but Ed 's . ) <p> Senta bouncy about it . Went around fingering things . Asking questions . No valley of the shadow , or shadow of the valley . She took a wooden dog with yellow eyes , black spots , and a sprouting tail . Ed laughed . Wrapped it in tissue paper . They waited for me . <p> I took a big black pot . The famous black pottery of Oaxaca . It was funereal . Everyone frowned . " Hard to carry , " Ed said .

Gets a letter months after . By the time he is home on leave , his mother 's mourning year is almost over . She is sick of black bombazine and wants to dine out . But he feels newly bereaved . He stares at the headstone for hours as if it would force the ground to yield up his father . Back to battle he goes , wearing boots that were the dead man 's . They do n't protect him . <p> The book did n't sell well . Too sad . I guess I wrote it to exorcise Ed . Did n't work . He 's alive , after all : kicking .

Old eyes . <p> After she left , I laid my cheek against the shirt . I needed the touch . <p> SENTA I called the dog Jack . Ed had always been an admirer of Jack London , and not only The Call of the Wild ; besides , the animal had a raffish , awkward look : No pretentious name from history or mythology would do . <p> I hate not being able to have a real dog .

Benny sat in back with the giant pot on his lap . He winced whenever we went over a bump , and since Ed had already consumed several beers , his driving was not as smooth as in the morning . I hoped he knew the road blind by this time . Grace sitting there calmly reassured me . She was a practical woman with a strong instinct for survival . If she doubted Ed 's sobriety , she could ask me to take over . She did n't drive anymore herself .

" <p> " Well , " he said , " when have they ? " At the gate where we were lined up , he was the center of attention , so tall and with the pot clasped in his arms like a holy child . <p> This was what we did best together , Benny and I : suffered deprivation . We agreed to expect nothing in the way of love , and showed each other our scarred and hardened hearts .

It 's a perpetual present with a few cards and letters and phone calls traveling between me and Benny and Grace and Ed , each one launched with a little glow of enterprise , like a venturing ship , then fading as it receives no proper response . Benny and I , for example , do n't have any momentum at all . The only time we get fired up is when we jeer at Ed and Grace . The rest is demand , defense , embarrassment , silence ; we ca n't even make a plan to have dinner . As for Ed and Grace , I write less and do n't care to go again .

Then he said , " Ashes to ashes . " I was startled . For a second I thought Ed was dead and Benny knew and I did n't . Then he said , " The fireplace . I put it by the fireplace . " <p> That was the best conversation we 've had . <p> When bad guys get old , people forget that they ever were bad . Age grants clemency . They become retired desperadoes with soft chins and swollen knuckles , robbed of their flash and devilry . No one wants to hang them by the neck anymore . <p> Well , maybe some do .

They are not planning to pursue Ed and Grace across the mountains ; to duel them by moonlight , cruel as the Aztecs , high up at Monte Alban . This is because they are tired .

She has five children , and chickens . She is thirty . This is the best it will get . <p> Grace and Ed , meanwhile , hide from the heat in their bedroom . They lie on ironed sheets , waiting for sundown  --  beer and brandy and kinder light . Grace is afraid Ed will die first , and he is afraid that she will . They watch each other sleep . <p> <p> By KATHERINE WEISSMAN <p>
