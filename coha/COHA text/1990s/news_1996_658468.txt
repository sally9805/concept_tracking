<p> Do n't try to adjust your dial . If the faces on your TV screen look familiar , it 's because this fall , the networks have gone back in time - circa the 1980s . They 've drawn from a stable of television and movie stars that includes everyone from former " brat packer " Molly Ringwald to Bill Cosby . <p> Even Michael J. Fox is facing studio audiences again . <p> But while this season 's comedies boast enough star power to light Los Angeles , it may not be enough to entice people to turn on the tube . <p> In the same way that few of the " Friends " knockoffs survived last season , familiarity - once again - may not breed hits . Only nine out of last season 's 42 new shows are returning for a second year . And based on the fall pilots , only a handful of this year 's is likely to weather the ratings war . <p> The comedy voted " most likely to succeed " by critics is Spin City ( ABC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is master of comic double takes and Machiavellian moves that would do Alex P. Keaton proud . Fox is a natural in this role - which is n't a stretch after his performance as a political sidekick in the 1995 movie " The American President . " Carla Gugino holds her own as Flaherty 's reporter girlfriend , and Richard Kind is noteworthy as the press secretary . <p> But the concept of a smart political whip cleaning up after his bumbling boss is hardly original ( anyone remember " Benson " ? ) , and the otherwise smartly written series is racy and relies on crudity to fill slow moments - a trend all too prevalent this season . <p> Fox 's former " Family Ties " sibling Justine Bateman appears in NBC 's Men Behaving Badly - a name that serves more as a warning label than a title . Starring Ron Eldard ( " ER " ) and Rob Schneider ( " Saturday Night Live " ) and based on a British TV show , this vulgar version is not likely to appeal to anyone on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trend among this year 's comedies , the show deals in a juvenile way with sex and is downright unappealing . Too bad for Bateman , who , with the right vehicle , might have had more of a comeback chance . <p> Brooke Shields is suddenly popular again with the launch of NBC 's Suddenly Susan . Her rise is yet another indication that a guest appearance on " Friends " can be a Midas touch for actors . ( Look at what it 's done for Tom Selleck . ) Critics are gushing , but it seems a bit premature to crown Shields the new queen of comedy . She plays a sheltered woman who has just left her husband-to-be at the altar and wants to live life on her own . To get a job writing a magazine column , she must prove to boss Judd Nelson that she 's an " interesting person . " Apparently that means getting drunk and smoking cigars in a bar with a co-worker . Still , with its cushy time slot just after " Seinfeld , " " Suddenly Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratings . <p> Molly Ringwald , another ' 80s teen star , is the only bright spot in Townies ( ABC ) . The forgettable comedy about life in a small New England fishing town borrows heavily from " Mystic Pizza . " ( It even features Conchata Ferrell from the movie . ) Bathroom humor and excessive stereotyping of small-town life abound . <p> Bill Cosby is also back for another try . Cosby ( CBS ) borrows from the British hit " One Foot in the Grave . " The show is less upbeat than fans of " The Cosby Show " are used to , but it still packs plenty of comedic punch . The Cos stars as Hilton Lucas , a downsized airport worker with too much time on his hands and too many home-improvement ideas for his wife 's liking . Phylicia Rashad again serves as a wifely foil to Cosby 's banter . And Madeline Kahn adds delightful lunacy as their friend . <p> Besides " Cosby , " viewers wo n't see many minority faces in comedies on the major networks . Smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately , their offerings are far from satisfying . <p> Take , for example , Malcolm &; Eddie . Cosby 's former TV son , Malcolm-Jamal Warner , stars with comedian Eddie Griffin in this African-American " Odd Couple . " It is the best of UPN 's new Monday-night lineup , but it still has a long way to go . <p> Following " Malcolm &; Eddie , " Sherman Hemsley , of " The Jeffersons " fame , stars in Goode Behavior ( UPN ) . Hemsley 's broad comedic shoulders are n't enough to save this comedy - about a convict who moves in with his estranged son - from mediocrity . <p> The third Monday-night newcomer on UPN is Sparks . If only there were some . This dull legal comedy features James Avery , the father from " Fresh Prince of Bel Air , " and " Head of the Class " alum Robin Givens . <p> Also in the " not worth rushing home to watch " category is Lush Life ( FOX ) , which stars Karyn Parsons from " Fresh Prince of Bel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tank Girl , " as unlikely buddies . Better titled " Women Behaving Badly , " this silly show got our vote as the season 's worst offering - just nudging out its male counterpart on NBC . <p> Still needing some work but clearly on the right track is NBC 's Something So Right . It is a charming take on two divorcees ( avec kids ) starting a new life together . " Brady Bunch " comparisons are inevitable , but stars Mel Harris ( " thirtysomething " ) and Jere Burns ( " Dear John " ) sweetly skewer family stereotypes in a half hour that manages to be both funny and sincere . Some unneeded sexual innuendo will hopefully fall by the wayside as the show finds its feet . <p> Of the four comedies featuring teachers this fall , two have some known star power . Pearl ( CBS ) stars " Cheers " barmaid Rhea Perlman as a middle-aged widow returning to college . Perlman 's character is likable , and Malcolm McDowell is convincing as her sardonic humanities teacher . But based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its script to make this potentially clever show stick . <p> Despite its faults , " Pearl " outclasses Mr. Rhodes ( NBC ) , a comedy about a hip teacher ( Tom Rhodes ) at a boarding school that draws its supporting actors from shows like " Barney Miller " and " Wings . " As with some of the other classroom comedies , little teaching occurs and hipness outweighs humor . <p> Finally Ink , a show CBS is banking on to boost last season 's lackluster ratings , wo n't debut until Oct. 21 . ( " Murphy Brown " creator Diane English was brought in to give it a major overhaul . ) The comedy stars real-life husband-and-wife Ted Danson ( " Cheers " ) and Mary Steenburgen as a divorced couple working for the same newspaper . <p> The verdict : Fall is full of fine actors crying out for an equally fine showcase . The main culprit : a dearth of good writing . So , what 's a viewer to do ? Aim the remote at " Cosby , " " Spin City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold out hope for " Pearl " and " Ink .
