What a mess in Washington too . From the outset , Bill Clinton 's Bosnia policy has been equal parts wishful thinking , domestic politics and bluff ; now it has virtually disintegrated under the pressure of the Bosnian Serbs and quarreling presidential advisers . The Serb triumph at Bihac has brought home the extent of Washington 's failure and opened a bitter debate about what to do next . " Our policy is in complete disarray , " admits a senior official . The debacle on the battlefield left the White House , senior Administration officials and a leading legislator separately enunciating contradictory positions . <P> Even before Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveled to Brussels to reiterate U.S. commitment to the Contact Group plan  --  which would give 51% of Bosnia 's territory to a federation of Bosnia 's Croats and Muslims and 49% to the Bosnian Serbs  --  the Pentagon was urging Clinton to cut his losses and compromise with the Serbs . Aides to Secretary of Defense William Perry warned him that NATO was being torn apart over Bosnia , and the Administration 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rift . The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised that no military threats from NATO would bring the Serbs to a political settlement . According to a position paper classified secret , prepared for Perry and obtained by TIME , " we should recognize that nothing about Bosnia is worth a serious split with our NATO allies . . . We are at the point where we risk losing not only Bosnia but ( ( also ) ) NATO . " An Administration official who read an intelligence report based on electronic eavesdropping said the document had advised that Paris might be purposely inflaming tensions over Bosnia to drive a wedge between Britain and the U.S. France , according to the intelligence analysis , would like to see NATO broken up and replaced by a European security alliance . <P> All this led Perry to arrive at the White House Monday with a position paper advocating an " illusion-free Bosnia policy " that would " stop advancing proposals we know the allies will . . . reject . " Among its directives : tell the Bosnian government " that they will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Contact Group ; drop any thought of lifting the arms embargo ; and accept a confederation of the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs and Belgrade . The Defense Secretary publicly floated the confederation idea the next morning , as newspapers trumpeted a major reversal in U.S. policy . <P> That provoked an uproar at the State Department and the National Security Council , both of which thought Perry had agreed to something quite different at the White House meeting . " Perry stepped in a cesspool with that confederation idea , " fumed a top official . " That 's a code word for annexation . Our policy is to uphold certain basic principles , " including Bosnia 's sovereignty . Christopher called in reporters to deny any change in U.S. policy . National Security Adviser Anthony Lake delivered a speech in Princeton , New Jersey , siding with State and repudiating any notion of Serb confederation , though he admitted it was " up to the parties to agree on future constitutional arrangements . " In Brussels , Christopher proposed a big international conference to work out a settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months . " It 's fair to say this policy has limited prospects of success , " admits a senior official .
