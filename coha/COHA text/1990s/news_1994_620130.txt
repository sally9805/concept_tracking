<p> In 1970 , Oakland became one of the first major U.S. cities to receive cable television , with operators promising to fully wire the city within four years . <p> Today , some residents are still plaintively singing the " I want my MTV " line from a hit Dire Straits song . <p> Cable television never arrived in areas that were regarded as too commercial or industrial to support the cost of extending underground cable lines . That means most of downtown , Jack London Square , portions of West Oakland and many commercial strips are without cable . <p> A 1983 franchise agreement with the city allowed Cable Oakland to skip those areas . <p> But plenty has changed in the past decade . <p> Many of those once-commercial zones have blossomed into thriving enclaves of newly arrived immigrants , low-income tenants , artists and first-time home owners . The city has aggressively promoted redevelopment in Old Oakland and Jack London Square  --  two neighborhoods blacked out from cable . <p> Also , cable coverage has been spotty in some of the city 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable TV in the 1970s but lost it because of concerns about technician security . However , only in the past year has cable reached the 750-unit Acorn housing complex in West Oakland . <p> " I want cable , " said 31-year-old Yvonne Ross , a resident of Acorn , where half of the apartments are still without service . " If you go knock on everybody 's door , they 'll tell you the same thing . " <p> FEW AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVES <p> Some businesses , such as Mac 's Sports Bar &; Grill at Jack London Square , have bought satellite dishes to provide their customers with a broad menu of sporting events . But that option is simply not affordable to most residents , such as Corazon Banks of the Acorn complex . <p> " We do n't have any choices here . . . . My television set gets poor reception , and the quality of the pictures is n't very good , so you get about two or three channels , " she said . <p> For most of her 11 years at Acorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been trying to get people at the cable company not to be discriminatory at our developments for five years , " said Lily Toney of the Oakland Housing Authority , which oversees hundreds of housing developments . " We 'll soon know if we have been successful . We think it 's going to work . " <p> Cable Oakland General Manager Clay Owens said the Acorn complex will have cable by the end of March . He attributes the delay in wiring some areas to the difficulty and expense associated with underground wiring . <p> But council member Natalie Bayton says that she is perplexed that consumers have had to wait so long for a service which , among other things , has become an invaluable source of civic information . <p> " I 'm not in the opinion that everything is OK , " Bayton said . " Cable is a major vehicle for both city and federal government to get information to the public . A significant group of people is really being closed out of the process . Non- English-speaking people can not get ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20,000 of her constituents can not get cable . <p> " I do n't think it was any accident that this section of town got left out , " Bayton said . <p> Deputy City Manager Ezra Rapport acknowledges that it has taken a long time , perhaps too long , to fully wire the city . <p> " This was one of the first cable systems in America . No one knew what the costs or parameters would be , " Rapport said . " So it was difficult to play hard line . " <p> IT BEGAN IN THE ' 60S <p> In the late 1960s , five companies bid for a franchise agreement with the city to build a cable system . <p> In December 1970 , the low bid was submitted by Focus Cable of Oakland and Teleprompter Cable of New York , which were awarded a 15-year , nonexclusive franchise agreement with the city . In exchange for using the public rights- of-way , the company promised to bring an array of channels and services through cable , even a burglar alarm system . <p> Completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by February 1972 , it became apparent that the job would not be done in time . So the city agreed to contract amendments that gave the company more time to finish the system . Changes in federal guidelines also allowed Oakland 's cable operator to charge more for basic service and pay less in city franchise fees  --  giving the company more money to grow . <p> By 1981 , 613 miles of cable had been laid , and the total number of subscribers stood at 25,000 , according to city records . Nearly $ 40 million had been invested in the system . <p> But the job of wiring Oakland 's residential areas was still far from completed . <p> In 1981 , Westinghouse Corporation bought the Oakland cable system . But because Federal Communications Commission rules prohibited a company from owning both a commercial TV station and a cable system within the same area , Westinghouse eventually was forced to sell several cable systems including the one in Oakland so it could keep its San Francisco-based TV station , KPIX . <p> During the sale negotiations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays , stepped up its oversight of cable TV . The city hammered out a long list of demands for the new owner . <p> The overriding objective , Rapport said , was to get the entire city wired for cable . <p> " There were many areas not wired because it was based on demographics like lack of income , and number of thefts were extremely high in certain areas of the city , " Rapport said . " There were major areas of West and East Oakland that were excluded . So the city insisted that many of these areas be wired . " <p> But federal rules and court rulings severely limited the city 's ability to regulate cable . <p> " During renewal , you ca n't ask for the stars ; you have to build on the prior agreement and be reasonable to avoid antitrust litigation , " Rapport said . <p> An agreement was reached in 1983 with Oakland 's new cable owner , the Philadelphia-based Lenfest Group , and the system was renamed Cable Oakland . Now , Cable Oakland provides service to 75,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1983 , only 18,000 homes were being served . <p> But patches of Oakland are still left out of the cable quilt work . Trying For Updates <p> " There were areas that were very expensive because they would have to be wired underground , and there would be very few residential users , " Rapport said . So most of the downtown , the waterfront and other mainly commercial areas were excluded because of a lack of consumers . <p> It has been more than 10 years since that agreement , and many people think it is time to re-evaluate the old contract and perhaps to add the areas left out of the system . <p> Owens could not agree more . <p> In fact , the company plans to update the system and hopes to make cable available to anyone who wants it  --  once Heritage Cablevision of Delaware Inc. , a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc. , take ownership from the Lenfest group after the agreement has been approved by city officials . <p> The new ownership should bring big changes , Owens said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable , " Owens said . " We want to provide cable to as many people as we can . We will be on the cutting edge . " <p> Meanwhile , West Oakland resident Bessie Gibson says she will keep waiting for basic cable . <p> " I keep hoping to see the cable installer outside my door , " Gibson said . " With all those music , childrens ' and gospel programs , my three kids would be inside watching cable and I would n't have to worry about them . So I just keep asking and waiting . "
