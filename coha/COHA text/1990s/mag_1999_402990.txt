It 's tough settling in a new country where stallion chops are on the menu and you ca n't recall the word for " rare " // A FRENCH neighbor told me he 'd recently attended a party where the drunken guests pooled their money and offered it as a reward to the first person who could defecate on a chicken . According to Laurent , catching the chicken had been the hardest part of the exercise . This led me to believe that he had been the winner , and the chicken the obvious loser . While it 's clearly not the brightest creature on the block , surely something must cross a chicken 's mind as it 's being shat upon . It might ask itself , " Why me ? " or wonder whether this is an isolated event or the beginning of a new and decidedly unpleasant way of life . My neighbor forged on to other subjects , and I nodded blankly , hearing nothing , as my mind was stalled beside the henhousewhere it remained , fully occupied , until the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the next fifteen months , or maybe longer , depending on how things go . While here , we 'll divide our time between Paris and Normandy , where Hugh has a house located in a village no larger than a football field . As there are no shops or diversions , the town 's two lone teenagers are so bored that they 've taken to lying on their backs in the middle of the road , reading fashion magazines and listening to Walkmans cranked so loud that they can be heard from a distance of twenty-five meters . Best friends with the same hairstyle , first name , and shoe size , they 've had it with agricultural fairs and harvest festivals at which they are forced to don cumbersome bonnets and stand upon a makeshift stage , churning butter until their palms are callused . I can understand how village life might seem unrewarding to a young person , but seeing as I am older and have never been forced into a pair of wooden shoes , I find that I really like it here . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staying two weeks every spring and a month and a half each summer . The first time I came , I was struck by what seems to be an overabundance of mental illness . At times , this small community resembles the grounds of an archaic state hospital , with our three retarded citizens wandering freely from house to house , dressed in their pajamas and clutching yanks of hair joyfully tugged from the backs of unsuspecting farm animals . It 's not unusual to be sitting on the toilet and have the bathroom door swung wide open by twenty-seven-yearold Maurice , who 's rushed over to tell me that he once saw a baby turtle . The first time this happened , I found it unsettling and mentioned the incident to Madame Duval , who lives across the street with her husband and her fifty-six-yearold sister-in-law , a small , bearded mongoloid who used to spend her days casting dice upon a small scrap of carpet but now prefers to stand stock-still in the garden , obsessively spitting on the hydrangeas . " Maurice caught you on the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and threw up her hands , saying , " Oh , that 's just his way . " It was n't the reaction I 'd been hoping for , but it heartened me to know that in at least one area of France , certain things are automatically forgiven on the basis of character . I later came to realize that in Normandy , while some people have their " way , " others do not . An example : Given that there 's not much else to do , my neighbors can really talk . The big news this summer concerns the village postman , who , I 've been told , was twice hospitalized for depression . Coming from the United States , I found this to be perfectly normal . " Only twice ? " I asked . " That 's all ? " Shortly after we arrived in August , I saw the postman parked outside our house . He beckoned me to his car and called my attention to a cheap cardboard calendar depicting three kittens frolicking in a basket full of yarn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the calendar at a distance and regarded it with great pride , as if he were somehow responsible for its clarity . " You wo n't find pictures like this back where you come from . " Photograph // I thought of the countless birthday cards sent by my aunt and my grandmother and lied , saying that Americans lacked both the skill and the imagination it undoubtedly took to execute such a precise and dramatic work of art . In my mind , this is what I said . What actually came out of my mouth was , " You are correct . The kittens of my country are lazy and uncooperative . " He stroked the calendar 's glossy surface and , with a pronounced tone of sacrifice , told me that I could have it . " Oh , " I said . " How kind of you . " He handed it to me and drummed his fingers against the steering wheel , repeatedly clearing his throat as if the transaction was not quite finished and some small but important formality had yet to be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , where I set the calendar upon the pile of papers we use to light fires . " Tell me you did n't ! " The neighbors got a big kick out of this , as I 'd apparently been expected to pay for the calendar before burning it . " You just took it without giving him any money ? Well , good for you . " The villagers had been down on this postman ever since he addressed a local woman by her first name . This is the equivalent of a bear hug and is grounds for legitimate hatred . The injured party , Madame Leduc , is the wife of a retired gas-station attendant . She rides into town wearing bedroom slippers and often scouts the nearby fields , collecting edible mushrooms in a patent-leather evening bag . It 's not as if the postman had addressed the wife of a prime minister as " Hey you , bitch , " but still , certain formalities must be observed . The retarded neighbors may , understandably , wander in and out of my house at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-name basis with someone he has known for ten years . I must kiss both cheeks of the pharmacist , a personal friend , but I can not shake hands with the butcher unless I encounter him on the street or at a social function . When passing the group of elderly , thickankled women hobbling to church , I should not say , " Hello , " but rather , " Hello , ladies , " indicating , I suppose , that I have not been deceived by their mustaches . When in the grocery store , I must not place my money into the owner 's hand ; rather , I should set it , gently and with precision , upon the cushioned mat positioned just so upon the counter . But mainly , I need to stop asking everyone from the mayor to the baker if , like me , they 're afraid of the living dead . " TU N'AS PAS PEUR des morts vivants ? " This is my new conversational icebreaker , and I use it every chance I get . Along with " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's all go to the slaughterhouse , " the zombie question is one of the few phrases I can rattle off with relatively few traces of a telltale American accent . I seem to know a great many nouns and adjectives , but I shy away from complex verbs and proper sentence structure . As a result , I can not say , " It was a pleasure to make your acquaintance , " but only , " You are certainly not a scarecrow , " a phrase that fails miserably in regard to conveying the joy of meeting someone . I 've enrolled in language school , and we 've decided to take an apartment in Paris , which is a magnificent city except for its public phone system . Out in the country , we 're limited to pay phones , meaning that any in-depth telecommunication requires pocketfuls of heavy , carefully saved change . In Paris , you pay with a collectible plastic card purchased at any of the four tobacco shops located on the nearest corner . The phone booths here are roomy and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's common to watch someone settle in with a twenty-dollar phone card and a thick address book . And it 's never , " I 'll meet you beside the fountain at dusk . " It 's never the phrases you learn in your language textbooks . Rather , you hear , " I 'm just thinking that maybe we should date other people " or " How long have you wanted to be a periodontal surgeon ? " Cell phones are used for making plans . Pay phones are used for slowly forming and terminating relationships . The newspaper rental listings came out on Wednesday , but by the time we got a shot at the phone booth , the available apartments had not only been rented but moved into and completely redecorated to the tenants ' specifications . Single women had coupled and given birth by the time we finally had a chance to place our calls . The first eight apartments we called were taken , so we tried the ninth , a two-bedroom with a balcony and splendid views of a reputable garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice before taking our call and asking what we did for a living . ( I say " we , " but Hugh did all the talking . Having lived here for six years during the eighties , his French is effortless and exact . ) He told the woman , very formally , that he was a painter , and she cut him off , saying , " I have a bird , so , you see , there are no painters allowed . " She said this as though there were some reasonable correlation between painting landscapes and the wellbeing of caged birds . I tried to put the two things together but drew a blank . " I need security , " the woman said . " I crave reassurance , and you offer me nothing . " Apparently it 's a French rule that you ca n't evict a tenant between the months of October and March . Even if someone refuses to pay his rent , you ca n't kick him out into the cold , as that would be considered savage and inhumane . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start looking for a warm place to spend the winter , the landlords are taking no chances-especially , it seems , those landlords who own birds . I find the human-decency laws to be charming but ca n't help wishing they extended to the use of pay phones . With all the advertised apartments spoken for , we sought out a real estate agent , a thoughtful , sleepy-looking man with twin moles placed like commas on either side of his mouth . He offered us a seat and , when told of our troubles with the bird owner , remarked that not so long ago it was nearly impossible for a bearded man to find an apartment . Neither Hugh nor I has a beard , so his comment threw us . I wanted to ask if it was equally difficult for warlocks , dwarfs , and mummies , mainly because I knew the words . " Explain , please , the situation with space aliens . Is it difficult for them as well ? " The man offered to show us a twobedroom half a block from the rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on , as , centered on the Sorbonne , the neighborhood is crazy with small shops devoted to the theme of medical need and curiosity . Here , it is possible to run out first thing in the morning and purchase a spanking-new cranial saw or an ancient wax model of a human vagina , complete with actual pubic hair . I bought my first two-headed-calf skull on this street , as well as a fine glass box carefully lined with deformed molars . Hugh likes the neighborhood because it 's a short walk to Notre Dame , the Pantheon , and the Luxembourg Gardens . I 'm excited by the strange row of outdoor pet shops lining a short stretch of bank across the river where , anytime you like , you can be reminded of why you really do n't want to own a monkey . Best of all , the apartment is just around the corner from one of the many butcher shops specializing in horsemeat . Memories of Satan and Whirlwind II cause Hugh to resist on sentimental grounds , but seeing as I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm longing to try a nice pony chop or a palomino cutlet . IN ORDER TO RENT this place , I needed to secure a guarantee from the bank , which is difficult if you do n't have a regular job with a weekly salary and a pillowcase full of payment stubs . The reviews of my last plays meant nothing to the bank president , who sat behind his desk , worrying what appeared to be a cluster of wolverine bites on his forearm . Maybe he 'd had an accident with the garbage disposal or stood too close to the propellers of a hydroplane . I was enchanted and missed the brunt of his recital , nodding with pleasure when told that , in order to secure a guarantee , I 'd need to place an entire year 's rent into an escrow account earning a paltry 4 percent interest . And that money could n't be used to pay the rent ; it would just need to sit there , doing nothing , during the entire time I occupied the apartment . " Really ? Great . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed contract , asking , " Tell me , though , person to person : Are n't you afraid of the living dead ? " Before signing a lease , you also have to buy renter 's insurance covering you for any possible fire or accident . The insurance agent had recently returned from a monthlong vacation and , like the bank president , had hands that were scabbed and etched with scratches . I asked if he owned a bobcat , and he explained that , no , he 'd fallen into a thicket of blackberry bushes while biking through a forest . Figures and percentages were mentioned , and my mind drifted off , returning only when I was instructed to sign a thick stack of unintelligible documents . Someday I 'll read them over , but in the meantime I think I am covered against both theft and curdled sauces . The lease-signing ceremony was equally draining . It is standard to pay three months up front , on top of the entire year 's rent that just sits in the bank doing nothing . Still , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fireplaces and beamed ceilings so high I 'll have to call the fire department in order to change a lightbulb . I was told that the building is more than four hundred years old and that the original tenants emptied their chamber pots out the window , carried swords , and wrote thank-you letters with quills . The landlord boasted that the apartment was cable-ready , but we found the cords depressing and cut them off at the base . Hopefully , by the time he says , " You did what ? " I will have learned to defend myself without mentioning the undead . HAVING FOUND an apartment , Hugh and I returned to Normandy to collect our belongings . Our neighbors greeted us with the ubiquitous " Ca va ? " This translates as " It goes ? " and , unless you 've got some major complaint , you respond by eliminating the question mark and saying , " Qa va . " Me , though , I just do n't like the sound of it and usually answer by saying either " Who knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return trip to Paris , the train was crowded . Hugh and I were separated , and I found myself obsessed with my seat mate . Though small , he was neither a dwarf nor a midget . His clothing led me to believe he might be a boy , yet his face was lined and worried . He carried a child 's satchel , but when the conductor came for our tickets , he pulled out an adult wallet packed with receipts and credit cards . One moment he was chewing gum and reading a comic book , and the next time I looked he was leafing through a manual on how to install your own septic tank . It was as if he held dual citizenship in two distinct ages and could skip back and forth between being ten and being thirty-five . We never spoke at length but shared a little moment when the train stopped outside of Paris and a man stepped on , accompanied by a German shepherd with a wooden leg . All evidence suggested that the owner had fashioned the limb himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most dogs , when forced to adapt , seem to get along fine with three legs , and this handmade prosthesis seemed more of a burden than a help . As the German shepherd clomped down the aisle and into the next car , my seat mate turned to me and whispered , " It goes . " And I agreed , saying that yes , indeed , it certainly does go . <p>
