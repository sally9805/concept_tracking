<p> Some decorator show houses are full of innovative ideas , monumental furniture and pricey fabrics . The American Hospital of Paris French Designer Showhouse , which opened here last week , is a variation on that theme . Full of emotional intensity and soulfully personal spaces , it offers allusions to the poetry of design more than trend alerts . <p> What is French style ? In this 1997 effort , " le style francaise " can be complex or simple . Consider the row of 36 tiny bags filled with lavender hanging in a crisp white dressing room . A 20-panel 1740 map of Paris , under Plexiglas , as a floor covering . A duo of cardboard Brillo boxes placed on a mantel , or a basket of bright yellow sunflowers entwined with stalks of fragrant rosemary on a terrace table . Each evokes a mood and suggests a deeper story . <p> French interiors often combine history , luxury , style , simplicity and eccentricity with confidence , edge and a bit of imagination . This show house offers a bit of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about stepping into a bathroom disguised as a Mondrian painting ? It 's the work of R. Scott Lalley , Raymond J. Cuminale and Corian . Or consider the very special velvet fabric in Nancy Corzine 's Sitting Room . Woven on French looms , it was made to look as if it had been eaten by generations of Gallic moths . Only $ 125 a yard . <p> Every two years , the organizers of this show house find a suitable mansion and gather French designers as well as French-Americans and others who like to decorate in the French style . This year 's theme for the 30 or so participants , according to Charles Patteson , who has produced five of the events , was design of the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s . And this five-floor town house on 67th Street between Park and Madison avenues ( currently on the market for about $ 5 million ) boasts sufficiently luxurious amenities : three terraces , a refrigerated wine cellar and a 50-foot indoor swimming pool . <p> Look up while you 're walking down the narrow stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjoining co-op building . There 's an arresting , almost life-size , faux-mosaic panel of a swimmer breaking the water 's surface , created by Groupe L'Artisan . <p> According to Lynda Gould , executive vice president of the American Hospital of Paris Foundation that is the beneficiary , the show houses have raised more than $ 1 million for the hospital . The French show houses have made such an impact because they encourage designers to spin out backdrops that capture a mood . <p> Creating a wordly salon with a sense of place is something French designer Jacques Grange has done for high-voltage clients such as Yves Saint Laurent , Stavros Niarchos and Princess Caroline . Grange says the uptown living room framed by burgundy and moss green unlined taffeta curtains that he staged here could be his own Manhattan hangout . Furnished with his first signature furniture collection for John Widdicomb Co. , Grange 's salon is chic yet understated . There 's his own oversized Louis XV-style chaise in burgundy velvet and an X-shaped sculptural bench done in the style of Ernest Boiceau , a 20th-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white photography , sharkskin boxes and a 1950s spidery metal lamp by Serge Mouille . <p> " I love doing something that 's not so glamorous , that 's more homey , " says Grange , who lives in the Paris apartment of writer Colette . <p> Do n't miss the wall covering . Grange says it 's actually a woven straw originally used by milliners in Paris for making hats . He 's used it in Princess Caroline 's dining room in Monaco . The silk on the pillows is Venetian . " Just by using a touch of fabric like this , I evoke the feeling of somewhere else . " On the coffee table , Grange has placed a copy of Proust 's evocative " Remembrance of Things Past . " <p> What possibly could be happening in Roger de Cabrol 's arresting fourth-floor roost painted in swaths of watermelon and cantaloupe inspired by a 1985 Kenny Scharf painting ? Cabrol , who titled his room " The Big Sleep , " was born in France and now lives in New York . He has worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly influenced by both ; the room reflects a bit of surrealism as well as classical French design . <p> " It 's a fantasy , " says Cabrol . Above the mantel is a carved wooden mirror from the 1940s shaped like a shield and painted white . Funky high-heeled upholstered chairs by the Canadian firm Design Emphasis face the fireplace . <p> When searching for an offbeat prop in the cleaning section of the supermarket , Cabrol passed up Mr. Clean and Tide for Brillo , whose box happened to be in the right colors . For reading material , instead of the tired stacks of dusty design magazines that designers tote from show house to show house as props , he offers Charles Bukowski 's " Pulp . " <p> The sentiment in the master bedroom is less edgy , yet still hip . Jeanne-Aelia Desparmet-Hart of JADH Interior Design , formerly of France and now of Larchmont , N.Y. , designed this room for a sophisticated couple who live in a funky yet chic neighborhood of Paris ( namely rue de L'Universite , Paris le 7eme S'Endort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously tuned into clean-lined design of the 1940s , have a smart room done in shades of ochers , blues , rusts and olives . Desparmet-Hart used an Arne Jacobsen " Egg " chair from the 1950s in its original tweed , and a set of sleek 1950s wooden nesting tables from noted American designer Terence Harold Robsjohn-Gibbings . The simple tailored bed with its Lucite legs is her own design . Sure , she says , people are tuned into more modern design . " But what has n't changed is the security of good antiques as a base . " <p> Odile de Schietere 's dining room down the hall was created for a much different imaginary couple . These more aristocratic types have inherited a cache of fine 19th-century Russian dining room chairs , but they 're also into 20th-century style . There is a 1950s Fornasetti mirror above the mantel , and a Daum horse in green designed by Dali . The table setting includes new china and crystal designs by French fashion designer Christian Lacroix for Christofle . But just to add that unexpected French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-painted fabric with gold squares on a velvet background , the work of Paris-based Sabina Fay Braxton , who is known for the luxe fabrics she creates for French fashion designers . <p> French-born New York designer Robert Couturier took a more ethereal view of his room . " Show houses are not permanent . They are transient , " he says . So he created a room for someone in transition  --  " a divorced lady in between marriages , " as he puts it , with a lot of style . He first tented the room in 80 yards of black and white cotton fabric boldly printed with an exotic design of salamanders , pineapples and birds by Timorous Beasties of Scotland . On the floor is a 10-by-14-foot area rug with elan : engravings of an 18th-century map of Paris . The unusual assortment of furniture includes a pair of chairs by Jean Royere , a French designer of the 1940s , made of gilded iron with red and white striped fabric seats , tables topped in Bakelite and a 19th-century German-made silver boat model . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Couturier . " Now it 's more about style and comfort . Up to a decade ago , the French style was all about 18th century , which always remains the beacon of the French psyche , sadly . " <p> The French can get spiritual about both traditional and contemporary design . Designers Lalley and Cuminale wanted visitors to feel " like they were stepping into a 20th-century modern painting . " French , of course . They chose the color blocks of Mondrian and commissioned DuPont 's Corian deftly cut into what look like puzzle pieces that fit snugly together on the walls and floors of their bathroom . <p> Perhaps the most passionate statement of this show house was made by French designer Paul Mathieu , a frequent French show house contributor . Mathieu 's " Man 's Dressing Room " is an evocative room done in honor of his late partner Michael Ray , who is believed to have committed suicide last July at age 36 . Everything in the small , spare white room has a deep symbolism and represents things that Mathieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was n't going to do this show house , but I realized that it could be a closure for me . I wanted it to be a peaceful place , " says Mathieu . " A dressing room is symbolic . It 's the first thing you face in the morning , and it 's your commitment for the day . " <p> The tiny room is full of references and allusions . A birch log is used as a simple table surface , fall leaves arranged in a frame represent nature . The dozen pressed white shirts from custom tailor Dormeuil represent Ray 's favorite clothing ; 36 sachets of Provencal lavender Mathieu picked near their home there each signify one year of Ray 's life . The quotes from the ancient Roman poet Virgil were painted around the room by Mathieu . The words refer to the life cycle of trees and " what earth takes and what art gives . " <p> " As a designer , I need to make a dressing room that is simple and it makes you feel good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . It is about the circle of life .
