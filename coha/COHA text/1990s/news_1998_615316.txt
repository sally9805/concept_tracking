<p> Julie Nadybal loved ballet . When she was in the eighth grade  --  blond , blue-eyed , her prospects as bright as her smile  --  she wrote a poem for English composition called " The Dancer I Should Have Been . " <p> " The dancer I should have been missed out on life , " the last stanza goes . " She was passionate about dancing alone . Unfortunately she did not remove her blinders to see what life has to offer . " <p> They read the poem at her funeral . One Wednesday afternoon in May , Julie , just 15 , came home from Cobb County 's Walton High School and hanged herself with a belt in her bedroom . Looking at the poem now , her mother , Marian Nadybal , shakes her head slowly and says , " She was insightful about her feelings , was n't she ? " <p> Traditionally , suicide has been thought of as an old man 's last resort . The most common victim , statistically , has been a white male older than 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly drinking , perhaps suffering from chronic illness . Ask experts for an example of the typical American suicide , and they usually point to the author Ernest Hemingway , who fit most of those descriptions in 1961 when he killed himself with a shotgun one month shy of his 62nd birthday . <p> But as tragic as it is , that is n't the sort of suicide that draws most of the concern these days . The most disturbing suicide trend of recent decades has been the soaring rate among young people . Since the late 1950s , the incidence of suicide among males ages 15-24 has more than tripled . ( It has risen among females as well , though not as dramatically . ) And the demographics of self-destruction keep getting younger ; the rate for children ages 10-14 has quadrupled . <p> Until the 1980s , this increase remained largely a white phenomenon . No more . In the past 15 years , young black males have been killing themselves at a growing pace that now approaches that of whites . <p> Youth suicide is the suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suicide say that the great majority of people who attend their sessions are grief-stricken parents seeking comfort and answers . It seems so inexplicable , so fundamentally wrong , for a life that has barely begun to end by its own hand . Speaking at a suicide memorial vigil in Washington last spring , Surgeon General David Satcher admitted that even though he had been around death his entire medical career , he was haunted by cases such as one he had just read about in the news . Kenny White , a 15-year-old in Pierre , S.D. , wrote a will disposing of his BB gun and baseball card collection , then , for no apparent reason , shot himself with his father 's pistol . <p> " I have not been able to get his story out of my mind , " Satcher said . <p> Deaths like that cling to the soul . Ron Maris , director of the University of South Carolina 's Center for the Study of Suicide , suggests why . " Teen suicide haunts us because our immortality is in our children . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-destruction <p> No one can say exactly why young people started killing themselves at greater rates during the ' 60s . Researchers believe it had to do with the increased use of drugs and alcohol , the growing availability of firearms , the younger onset of depression and other mental illness  --  perhaps even with the dissolution of family stability and the sheer jostling size of the baby boom generation . New research indicates that anguish over sexuality also plays a role , that gay and bisexual teens have a higher risk of ending their lives . <p> What experts can say with certainty is that suicide is different among the young . When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started studying suicide in the ' 80s , it discovered that teenagers who try to kill themselves do n't fit the reigning stereotype of older people attempting to extinguish their pain . " Many of them were n't even depressed , " says Mark Rosenberg , director of the CDC 's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control . " They were angry , in trouble , feeling hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caught us by surprise . " <p> Rosenberg did n't have to look far for an example of this new category of impulsive suicide . A teenage girl in his DeKalb County neighborhood , upset over a breakup with her boyfriend , shot herself in the head with a gun he kept next to his bed . She lived , but had almost perished in a flash of passion . <p> The incident demonstrates the deadly combination of impulse and means that experts believe lies at the heart of youth suicide . Studies show that many suicidal teenagers , unlike older people , are not as determined to kill themselves . The urge may well within them for five minutes and then subside , as if it were a childish threat to run away from home . That can be five minutes too long if a gun is within reach . Almost all the increase in youth suicide , Rosenberg notes , has been committed with firearms . <p> " No one is saying get rid of all the guns , " says Alan Berman , director of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them safely , we could prevent a lot of suicides . " <p> The danger is compounded by teenage perceptions . Given the way young people can feel invulnerable , and the way violence is portrayed so casually in today 's media , some teenagers do n't fully appreciate the permanence of suicide . <p> " They do n't realize that dead is dead , " says Iris Bolton , who has dealt with the consequences of suicide for 20 years as director of the Link Counseling Center in Sandy Springs . " We had a case where a 13-year-old girl committed suicide . She said people were being mean to her , so she 'd just kill herself , and when she came back in three weeks , they 'd all be nice to her . " <p> Tracy Dean , Bolton 's lieutenant at the Link , knows all about the fatal emotions of youth . In 1986 , when she was in high school in Atlanta , she had a fight with her boyfriend . He came to her house late one night in tears and threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , but he did n't show up at school the next morning . He had gone home , drained a bottle of liquor and shot himself . <p> " I was the last person to see him alive , " Dean says . " Guilt is n't just for parents . " Julie 's little book of secrets <p> Though more boys commit suicide , studies have found that girls try it at least as often . The discrepancy has to do with methods  --  males are more likely to use guns than pills  --  and perhaps with something else . Suicidologists believe that many young women want to be found out , that their attempts are a cry for help . <p> Marian Nadybal , for one , does n't believe her daughter truly intended to kill herself that afternoon in May . As she talks about her , sitting in the den of their upscale home in east Cobb County , the 43-year-old mother occasionally glances at a bookshelf where a portrait shows Julie at her confirmation , a string of pearls around her neck , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , a ghost the next . <p> Julie was the oldest of Marian and Jonathan Nadybal 's three children . She seemed a model daughter : honor student , member of the flag team , popular with her classmates . She liked to draw and dance and write . But there was an indefinable pain within her . Filling out a questionnaire for an honor 's English class , she was asked if there was anything she would like to change about herself . " To numb my extreme sensitivity and emotions , " she answered . <p> When she entered her teens , Julie developed eating disorders . A year and a half ago , she tried to take an overdose of painkillers . " You 'd be surprised how many kids think about suicide , " she told her mother . <p> The doctors suspected that Julie suffered from some chemical imbalance . She saw 10 medical and psychiatric professionals and went on and off medication . " We kept a list of their diagnoses and joked about it , " Marian says . " I remember coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's one we forgot about . ' " <p> It was n't until after the funeral that Marian understood how much her daughter was hiding . She found her journal  --  " My Little Book of Secrets , " it said on the cover  --  and followed the dark spiral of Julie 's moods . Until then , Marian had n't known that she had attempted suicide a second time last spring . Her third attempt was successful . Her little brother found her with the belt around her neck ; he had been writing a letter and walked into her room to ask her how to spell " consequences . " <p> " We knew she was sick , but we did n't know she was suicidal again , " Marian says . " She got up every morning at 6 and came out looking like Miss America . She was a very good actress . " <p> Marian does n't know what triggered it . Ultimately , it does n't matter . At the Link , where she and her husband went for counseling , they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup ; people usually attempt suicide not so much because of a single event as an accumulation of events and attitudes and frustrations that fill their psychic cup to overflowing . <p> " People always want to find something or someone to blame , " Marian says . " That 's immaterial to me . All that matters is that Julie was alone with her pain , and her cup ran over . " <p> At least the Nadybals had time to try to find help , a knowledge that brings them a measure of peace . Some parents never get that chance . James : a young man 's worries " If there is anything we have learned in the past 15 years , " the CDC 's Rosenberg says , " it 's that suicide is a much broader problem than we had thought . It does n't just occur to people who are mentally ill . It can be a problem for people who are socially isolated , for people who have trouble controlling their impulses , for kids who have trouble talking about their feelings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think he kept a lot of stuff locked up , " says Meg Avery , 41 , whose teenage son committed suicide last year for reasons she still can not fathom . She found him after work in the family 's ranch home in the north Gwinnett County community of Sugar Hill . " There was no depression , no fights , no trouble at home . It was a total shock . " <p> At 14 , James was a bookish kid with big glasses who loved to read and dreamed of becoming an oceanographer . He slept under a bedspread decorated with patterns of fish and seashells . He loved camping with his Scoutmaster father , Jim , and loved playing soccer . <p> A few years ago , one of his teammates committed suicide . " We all cried and talked about it , " Meg remembers . " We talked about it so much that James asked us not to talk about it anymore . So I never brought it up again . " <p> The Averys were aware that James was a sensitive boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't sleep on the nights before tests and became so sick that they took him to a doctor to get stomach medication . He had new worries last fall . He had started at North Gwinnett High School and was having trouble with a couple of courses . Characteristically , he did n't say much about it . <p> On the fourth Monday in September , Meg returned home from her job as a teacher 's assistant and found a note on the back door that James had printed out from his computer . " Now I wo n't have to finish high school , " it said . She had talked to him over the phone half an hour earlier ; now she found him hanging from the deck . <p> The remarkable thing is what the Averys did next . A meeting of their son 's Scout troop was scheduled that evening . Barely two hours after the ambulance took James ' body away  --  two hours of numb , sobbing shock  --  they went to the meeting and Jim told the Scouts what his son had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . If they ever feel tempted to do anything like that , they had to talk to someone . <p> Jim acknowledges it might look callous to have talked about his son like that so soon . " But he was gone , " he says . " I had a responsibility to those boys . They were going to hear about it anyway . " <p> In the same spirit , Meg has been pressing schools to do more to educate teachers and students about suicide . One school agreed and allowed the Link 's Tracy Dean to lead a session for teachers . Another school declined ; the principal thought it would give his students ideas . <p> Even as she has tried to find purpose in her son 's death , Meg has a hard time understanding it . Because there was something else in that suicide note , something that has caused her inconsolable hurt . Whether he meant it or not , James said that his life had been miserable . <p> " Well , who did he spend it with more than anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so angry with him ; I was cleaning his bedroom after it happened , and I just started ripping down his sports posters . He ended his pain that day , but mine started , and I do n't see an end to it . I 'll always wonder what I should have done , whether there was anything I could have done , but I 'll never have an answer . Never . " <p> It has been a year . She has had counseling , she goes to support groups , she tells the story and talks about her feelings . While her anger has cooled , the chill in her heart remains . <p> " I still have trouble saying that my son committed suicide , " she says . " Suicide is a very cold word .
