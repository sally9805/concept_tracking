Three men stand in an abandoned airfield alive with memories . Here , at Moton Field in Tuskegee , Alabama , their futures began over 50 years ago . They were called the Tuskegee Airmen-and in their hearts these many years later , they are still the Tuskegee Airmen . As an elite group of flyers , the Airmen soared in the name of freedom over the warriddled skies of North Africa , Sicily , Anzio , and Berlin . But the journey to liftoff in those days of World War II was not easy . These three-Lt . Col. Herbert E. Carter , Capt . Louis R. Purnell , and Lt. Col. Woodrow W. Crockett-have returned this day to tell the story . In the late 1930s , the quiet college town of Tuskegee had no hint it would be propelled into aviation history . Neither did Carter , an Amory , Mississippi , native . He first arrived in Tuskegee to attend prep school in the ninth grade . " If you finished there , you could attend college . I was going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver hair framing his animated face , " but they did n't offer a vet degree . " What they did offer was a flying school , a civilian program to develop a pool of pilots . " But the War Department had no intentions of calling up black pilots , " Carter says . " It was determined that blacks did n't have the aptness , dexterity , or other qualities to operate aircraft . " Carter opted for the program anyway , knowing the slim chances of getting into the Army Air Corps ( which later became the Air Force ) . He obtained his private pilot 's license and received further training for a commercial license . Then he waited . Nothing happened until 1941 when a student at Howard University in Washington , D.C. , filed suit to gain admittance into flight training . Soon afterward , President Roosevelt opened the application process to " colored " pilots . The response was overwhelming . Thousands of young black men , long denied the chance of playing an active part in the military , volunteered . The flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1942 , my class finished , " recalls Carter . " We thought we 'd be in the war by Thanksgiving , but Christmas found us still in Alabama . " Finally in April 1943 , Tuskegee 's 99th Fighter Squadron left for North Africa . " Our mission , " says Carter , " was to find and destroy targets such as ammo dumps , railways , anything to stop enemy supplies . " Photograph ( From left ) Lt. Col. Herbert E. Carter , Capt . Louis R. Purnell , and Lt. Col. Woodrow W Crockett are three of the 900 renowned Tuskegee Airmen who broke the color barrier in the skies during World War II . // But it was n't until the invasion at Anzio that the 99th began flying P40s in air combat operations against a large number of enemy aircraft . After other assignments , the group was transferred to the 15th Strategic Air Force in June 1944 to provide long-range escort of heavy bombers ( B-24s and B-17s ) , flying P-47s for one month , then the " dream airplane " - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squadron joined the 332nd Fighter Group ( composed of three other black squadrons ) , making the 332nd the only four-squadron group in the Mediterranean theater . " In over 200 missions we never lost a bomber to enemy air action , " reports Carter . " We took great pride in our record and our unit , and wanted our bomber pilots , as well as the Germans , to know who we were . The 332nd 's P-51s had their tails painted red-that 's how we became known as the Redtails . " Captain Purnell , striding across Moton Field , builds on his friend 's reminiscences . Intense eyes behind rimless glasses study the one remaining hangar from the Tuskegee primary aviation cadet training days . ' " You know , " he says , " there 's an old theory about the bumblebee-because of its wingspan-toweight ratio , it should not be able to fly . But the bee , unaware of this , flies anyhow . The same was true of us . " On much the same timetable as his colleagues , Purnell , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of ' 41 to take the nonmilitary advanced course for pilots . " I finished in September , " he remembers , " but my color prevented me from going any further . " Frustrated , he considered filing suit , but then the Corps accepted black pilots . " Two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor , I reported to Tuskegee Army Air Field as an aviation cadet , " he says . After earning his wings in 1942 , Purnell became part of the 99th Fighter Squadron-and waiting . " We were undoubtedly the most highly trained squadron in the U.S. , but the Air Corps brass could n't decide what to do with us . We flew and flew for nearly a whole year simply to maintain our proficiency . It looked as though the black squadron was in danger of becoming a white elephant . " When the squadron was finally dispatched to North Africa , Purnell became a specialist in dive-bombing and strafing . " By the time we moved to northern Sicily , I had completed my tour-50 missions , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like combat to draw people together , " says Purnell . " After a while the whites requested our presence to escort their bombers . We overcame the misconceptions about blacks in the military and accomplished what was believed impossible . " Quietly absorbing the conversation , Crockett , the third Airman strolling the old field , squints up at a bright Alabama sun and remembers his own reasons for flying . " It was purely economical , " smiles the Texarkana , Arkansas , native . " I had to leave school in 1940 because I was unable to afford the $6a-month tuition , so I decided to join the Army . My plan was to save my money for three years and come back to finish my education . " Photograph ( Left ) In the office at Moton Field , you can see photographs from days gone by-men preparing for the mission of fighting for their country , as well as fighting just to fly .

" The Air Corps had put a sign in our orderly room at Fort Sill , Oklahoma , where he served in the artillery that said , Be a pilot , bombardier , or navigator and earn $245 per month , ' " recalls Crockett . " As a private , then , you drew $21 a month . So I held out for the Air Corps . " Staff Sergeant Crockett arrived at Tuskegee as an aviation cadet in August 1942 . After graduation in March 1943 , he trained with the 332nd Fighter Group at Selfridge Field , Michigan , before transferring to Naples , Italy , in January 1944 . " I flew 107 missions within a four-month period , when 50 missions were the usual tour of duty , " Crockett reports . " There were not enough black replacement pilots , so we kept flying . We knew this was an experiment , and the pilots and support personnel were determined not to let it fail . In all I flew 149 combat missions . " Crockett does not want the Tuskegee Airmen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight school , " he says . We should be remembered for completing 1,578 missions and over 15,000 sorties . I want us to take our proper place in the history books , " he says . The three men walk through the now-deserted 1941 hangar and reminisce . Time has been kind to them . Carter returned to Tuskegee to head its ROTC program in 1965 . He retired from the Air Force in 1969 . " Mildred his wife of 53 years and I thought it was a great opportunity for our children to gain exposure to their cultural background , so we stayed in Tuskegee after retiring , " he says . Purnell and his wife , JoAnn , live in Washington , D.C. , where he worked as curator at the National Air and Space Museum after leaving military service as a captain . And Crockett , after retiring from the Air Force in 1970 , worked for the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon for 6 years .

Together the pilots stroll through the small office adjacent to the field and peruse the photos of dashing young men in flying gear . Among them are a boyish Herbert Carter , an Eddie Murphy lookalike in flyer 's goggles , and a dapper Woody Crockett smiling from the front page of the New York Times . Lou Purnell gazes at a picture of himself , noting , I was 22 , innocent and pure . " The other two laugh heartily . They were all pure and innocent back then . As the men prepare to leave the memories , a young man with blond , close-cropped hair approaches . " Did I hear you say you were Tuskegee Airmen ? " asks John Green , a helicopter pilot in training at nearby Fort Rucker . " I wanted to come and see Tuskegee , " he says . " Most any aviator has heard of you guys . It 's really a thrill to meet you .
