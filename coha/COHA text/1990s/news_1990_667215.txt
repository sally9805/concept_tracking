<p> At least 60 people are at their beck and call , like servants before five kings . <p> A " toy truck " filled with motorcycles and skateboards often accompanies them on tour . <p> One way The New Kids on the Block like to have fun : taking over fast-food places - jumping behind the counter and crooning into microphones . <p> " Boys will be boys , " says Donnie Wahlberg , 21 , the most outspoken and impish of the pop quintet . <p> But lately , The New Kids have become the bad boys . <p> Several incidents in the past five months have dirtied the squeaky-clean image that has helped build them into a multi-million-dollar money-making machine . <p> - During a September plane ride , Donnie scuffled with a college student , poking him in the eyes . <p> - Their creator and co-manager , Maurice Starr , has been linked to the mob . ( " Never ! " says co-manager Dick Scott . ) Starr has denied reports he gave a reputed organized crime figure a share in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits - including a pending case alleging Jordan Knight and Danny Wood cribbed too much of I 'll Be Your Everything from Percy Sledge 's 1974 song of the same name . Another claimed USA TODAY and other publications infringed The New Kids trademark in 900-number reader surveys . It was dismissed , but the group is appealing . <p> " All in all , we 're five , nice , positive guys , " says Jordan , 20 , touted as the one with the best shot at a solo career . " It 's just that we 're sick of people trying to step on us . If you do nothing ( but be ) squeaky clean , people jump all over you . " <p> " We 're human , " says the oldest and quietest Kid , Jonathan Knight , 21 , exasperated . " We doo-doo in the toilets and do everything people do . " <p> " People see us as squeaky clean and All-American , " adds the youngest and most angelic-looking New Kid , Joe McIntyre , 17 . " That 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a lot more . We are slick . We are well-packaged ... ( but ) I 'm not talentless . Onstage ... that 's where our talent comes out . " But offstage is where the trouble has come out . <p> As for the airplane story , Donnie says he was provoked into poking a passenger in the eye during a dispute over a seat on a night flight . " I wo n't sit here and talk about the whole fight , " he says , slouching on a couch in his tour manager 's hotel suite . " But I did not go back there and wake a kid up . I think we 're the easiest scapegoat . ... I 'm not gon na come out and say that we 're angels . I 've never asked to be clean-cut , goody two- shoes . " <p> Says their road manager , Cathy McLaughlin : " When people say Donnie has this bad image , I 'd like to tell them about a little girl in a wheelchair who Donnie visited . She was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a wheelchair ! Let 's go do wheelies . ' He went and got New Kids bumper stickers and put them all over her chair . That was one happy little kid . " <p> Charles Dundee , 33 , drove for the group for three months last spring : " Donnie 's a good-hearted person , but Donnie 's a hothead . I almost got into a fist fight with him once . " <p> Dick Scott shrugs off Donnie 's antics as " bravura and posturing . " <p> The kind of posturing learned in group members ' streetwise upbringing in the Dorchester section of Boston . Jordan and Joe also were recently involved in fracases . Joe recalls being in a club , and " This guy came up and said , ' I do n't like you guys , but my girlfriend wants an autograph . ' " Words were exchanged ; Joe says he was pushed . <p> About the song-cribbing lawsuit , Jordan says , " I ca n't talk about it , but it happens to everybody . It 's such a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs with that same structure . " <p> And the incidents happening so closely together ? " A coincidence , " says Joe . <p> But it has n't looked good for young men who make a living off their seal of parental approval , their G-rated gyrations that send girls swooning . At stake : a yearly income estimated at $ 55 million from record , ticket and merchandise sales . <p> Margareth Stoll , 44 , of Dearborn Heights , Mich. , says she remains a loyal fan . She and her 16-year-old daughter , Jennifer , have seen 17 Kids concerts , logging 9,000 miles . <p> " They 're human beings and I think they 're going to do things and I would expect them to . We happen to believe they 're honest people . " " They 're sweet , nice guys , " says Meghann Buckley , 12 , of Granger , Ind . " They 're such good role models and if they go and do something bad that makes me mad . But self-defense , I say that 's fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thinking about the negative press . " My house got shot at ! We found a bullet ! That 's attempted murder ! " <p> Taunts , jeers , criticism . <p> Critics see analogies to discredited rockers Milli Vanilli , saying the Kids do n't play instruments , that they 're a choreographed , stylized pop product . That they 're controlled by their managers . <p> The Kids resent that . First of all , they do n't lip-sync , they say . Though they did on their first tour . <p> Says Donnie : " Never have we fully , totally , used total tracks . People say Donnie ca n't reach the notes no more , and it 's true . I have n't been rehearsing . I 'm getting old . " <p> And they say they could fire their managers tomorrow if they wanted . " People do n't think we 're the bosses , but we are , " says Jordan . <p> Co-manager Dick Scott , 57 , who has worked with recording artists for 30 years , knows how to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can do whatever you want to do , just understand who you are and that everything you do will be blown out of proportion . The world is waiting for you to fail . " <p> Scott says the Kids are n't just getting older , they 're getting better . " They 've grown 1000% . " <p> And their image is far better than that of the stereotypical rock group . <p> Drinking ? No , each one shakes his head . <p> Drugs ? No way . " I say ' Drugs suck ' ( in the show ) because that 's my opinion of them , " says Donnie . <p> They all saw enough of that growing up : Donnie admits to fooling around with marijuana and booze when he was younger , and learned his lesson . <p> And girls ? No denials here . " These are virile , young , hot-blooded boys , " says Scott , chuckling . His advice to them ? <p> " Be careful . " <p> Jonathan , linked with Tiffany , will admit to a girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name is " Mary . Mary Jones . " <p> Joe realizes a girlfriend would damage his image as an eligible heartthrob , so he 'll hold off " a couple of years . " <p> " All of them are pretty level-headed , considering ... " says Scott . " It 's very difficult . They have no life of their own . " <p> Despite those who say the New Kids ca n't last , Scott says , " I will not rest until the world knows who they are . I tell them : ' Guys , nobody knows who the heck you are yet . ' I do n't want them to think they 've made it . " <p> You 'd almost think they had n't , watching their excitement as they walk into their road manager 's hotel suite and spy five big Christmas stockings , spilling over with packages for them . They 're gifts made by a fan or fan 's mom . " Wow ! " Danny says , eyes bright as he rips into the paper . <p> On tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday Thompson Boling Arena Birmingham , Ala . ...
