Adnan sat in the sand with some of his Palestinian neighbors just a few yards away from an open sewer in the Gaza Strip 's Shati Camp and promised the destruction of Israel . " Yasser Arafat means nothing to me , " he said . " I want all of Palestine back . " Adnan , who gave only his first name for fear of arrest by military authorities , lost his job in Israel last March when the government sealed off the violence-riddled Gaza Strip . " My parents were thrown out of their town in 1948 , " says Adnan , 25 . " Any Russian Jew can live there now , but I have never seen it . We are ready to fight and die as martyrs rather than accept this . " <P> The " we " Adnan refers to are his fellow supporters of Hamas . Of all the organizations eager to kill the rapprochement between Israel and the Arabs , the militant Muslim fundamentalist group is probably the greatest threat . An acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement that literally means " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jewish state , followed by the establishment of an Islamic Palestine as a precursor to a greater pan-Arab union . The organization was born in the misery and despair of the teeming refugee camps of the Gaza Strip five years ago , two months after the beginning of the intifadeh . Within three years the fundamentalists that the Israelis had once allowed to exist as a counterbalance to the P.L.O . were outlawed as the most serious security problem in the occupied territories . Hamas ' appeal is both social and political . With money from Iran and private Arab benefactors in the gulf , the organization runs clinics and kindergartens  --  and candidates for chamber of commerce elections . Preaching radical solutions from the mosques , Hamas has rapidly won converts disenchanted with the foibles and failures of the P.L.O . It now claims support from a majority of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and at least 40% of West Bank Arabs . <P> The group 's aggressive violence has made Israel 's occupation of the Gaza Strip moredangerous than ever . Israeli soldiers are constantly stoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets . When three factory workers were partly disemboweled in Jaffa three years ago , the Israeli government arrested hundreds of Hamas activists and deported four of their leaders . Hamas proceeded to increase its attacks , using guns and knives and an occasional roadside explosive charge . Israel retaliated against the escalating violence last December by deporting 415 leaders and supporters of Islamic movements , particularly Hamas , to wintry southern Lebanon . But their banishment brought them attention from all over the world and made them heroes at home . <P> The Israeli Defense Forces see the militant group as a double security threat once the territories are granted autonomy . They fear Hamas will go after Israeli settlers and the new Palestinian authorities in the Gaza Strip and Jericho , provoking reprisals that could easily turn into a bloodbath . They are also worried about how much easier it will be to stage large-scale terrorist operations into Israel . The Israelis will still command the bridge connecting Jordan and Jericho , but they will no longer control Gaza port . Today the Palestinians have no missiles that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crude Katyusha rocket smuggled in by sea could hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon , only eight miles away .
