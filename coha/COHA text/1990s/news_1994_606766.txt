<p> The ceremony to crown Miss Alcorn State University was almost over when a family heard that Steve McNair , the school 's quarterback , was standing in the hallway outside . <p> Grandparents , grandchildren , aunts , uncles , nieces , nephews , cousins , husbands and wives came down out of the gymnasium stands and wheeled around the corner and suddenly McNair looked as if he were in the middle of a family reunion . They were from states as varied as Georgia , Kentucky and Washington . They posed for pictures with him . They asked for autographs . They all called him " Steve . " It was as if they knew him . <p> In a sense they do . By now , everyone does . If you 've heard of the school , you 've heard of him . Most likely , you 've heard of the school because of him . When Sam Weaver introduces himself as the head men 's basketball coach at Alcorn State , the response he gets is " How 's Steve McNair doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Weaver said . <p> McNair 's picture has been on the cover of Sports Illustrated , his exploits broadcast on ESPN , his story told on the pages of every major newspaper in the country , all because of the growing contention that he could win the Heisman Trophy and become a top pick in the 1995 National Football League draft . <p> " I never would have dreamed it would have gotten this big , " his mother , Lucile , said . " As he was coming up , he said he was going to be better . I would look for him to go far , but not this far . " <p> Agents call her house at all hours of the day . And even though McNair promises he 'll give her the Heisman Trophy if he wins it , he wo n't give her his phone number at school because he 's afraid she would pass it along . <p> McNair , a senior , said he enjoys the attention and he still greets each flashbulb with a smile , but he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a private life sometimes and private things to do around your friends . I ca n't do that now . I 've got to watch everything I say , everything I do because I 'm in that spotlight now . Life is harder . On the field and off the field , it 's harder . " <p> If the pressure is getting to him , he rarely lets it show . <p> " I still think Steve is handling it quite well , " Alcorn State Coach Cardell Jones said . " He has gotten a great deal of national celebrity , but he is still a down-to-earth player . I think it has n't affected his being focused on the ballgame . " <p> Part of the expectations for McNair come from the unbelievably high standards he has set . How many quarterbacks can throw for 344 yards and rush for 108 in the third game of the season and have their total yardage average decrease ? That 's what happens when you amass 633 yards in your first game and 647 in your second . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historically black college in the Division I-AA Southwestern Athletic Conference . That means he is n't competing for the Heisman , just for himself . <p> " He 's representing the SWAC , the state of Mississippi  --  definitely Alcorn State University  --  but basically small colleges throughout the United States , " Jones said . <p> " No one would really give a player from a small college a chance at winning the Heisman Trophy , but the Heisman Trophy stands for the best football player in the country . It does n't say whether it 's I-AA or I-A . I certainly feel that Steve is the best football player in the country . " <p> No Division I-AA player has won the Heisman since the National Collegiate Athletic Association 's top division split in 1978 . The closest a I-AA player has come was a third-place finish by Gordie Lockbaum of Holy Cross in 1987 , largely on the strength of his playing offense and defense . Grambling quarterback Doug Williams 's fourth-place finish in 1977 is the best by a SWAC player . <p> The governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faxing letters to Heisman voters . Alcorn State 's sports information office has increased its weekly mailing list from 150 to nearly 500 in the effort to spread McNair 's name and  --  more important  --  statistics . <p> In seven games this season he has completed 170-of-306 passes for 2,704 yards and 28 touchdowns , with 10 interceptions . He also has rushed 70 times for 672 yards ( an astounding average of 9.6 yards per carry ) and six touchdowns . He broke former Portland State quarterback Neil Lomax 's Division I-AA career total yardage record of 13,345 yards this season and is 264 yards away from passing former Brigham Young University quarterback Ty Detmer 's NCAA mark of 14,665 . <p> ' An Outstanding Talent ' <p> McNair 's accomplishments have only put Lorman on the map in the figurative sense . Good luck trying to locate it in an atlas . The easiest way to find Alcorn State is to follow the scouts and reporters making their way to campus to see McNair . Those who have been there say it 's worth the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Coughlin , who will coach the National Football League 's expansion Jacksonville Jaguars when they begin play next year . " He deserves to be in the top-10 pool of quarterbacks in the nation . " <p> Darrin Nelson , a former NFL running back , broadcast McNair 's game against Texas Southern on ESPN2 . <p> " I definitely think he has what it takes to play in the NFL , " Nelson said . " He has a couple of things that he needs to work on avoiding , though , like throwing off his back foot and throwing into double coverages . " <p> At 6 feet 3 , 218 pounds , McNair has good size and definitely an NFL-caliber arm . The combination of his vision and his ability to throw on the run pose a unique threat . He comes up with plays that even his receivers find amazing . <p> " There 's a lot of times I run a route and I do n't think he sees me and the next thing you know , he steps up and throws the ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreal . I have n't seen a quarterback like that since I 've been watching football . " <p> McNair is less adventuresome this year and does n't leave the pocket as quickly , a plus in the eyes of NFL observers . <p> " He runs only when he has to run , " Coughlin said . <p> But McNair is often at his finest when he 's forced to take off . On one play this season , he jumped back from two defenders and caused them to crash into each other . <p> " Once you think he 's topped his last move , then he goes and pulls something else out of his hat , " wide receiver Percy Singleton said . " This year , he 's staying more in the pocket . Last year  --  oh my goodness . He would jump over people , just all kinds of things . " <p> Any evaluation of McNair always comes back to the qualifier that he 's doing it against the defenses of the SWAC and its smaller players . <p> " He does n't face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scout for the Minnesota Vikings . " He faces good defensive linemen every week in games , but he does n't face the big , tall guys that he has to throw over . He 's usually throwing at the same height  --  guys are looking him in the eye . The cornerbacks are not as fast and not as quick as they are in the NFL , but his receivers , they 're not as fast as the guys he 's going to be with in training camp . It 's still a smaller division . He 's played against some great players , and some great players have come out of I-AA football and Division II football . It 's not a detriment , but it 's a knock . " <p> When it comes to Heisman consideration , the SWAC is a serious detriment . When McNair 's ridiculous statistics from last Saturday 's game ( 387 yards and five touchdowns passing , 107 and three touchdowns rushing ) made their way through the Florida Field press box , one writer dismissed them with only two words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive games . For some , the SWAC competition detracts from the accomplishments . <p> Doug Williams has heard enough SWAC-bashing . <p> " It 's a waste of time to argue with those people , " said Williams , who is an assistant coach at Navy . " The facts are already there . " <p> Indeed , a quick glance at the record books show that the NFL 's all-time leading rusher is Walter Payton , a Jackson State product , and its leading touchdown scorer is Jerry Rice of Mississippi Valley State . <p> McNair 's achievements have come against defenses that pull every blitz and stunt scheme imaginable and rotate as many as 12 players on the defensive line to keep their players fresh for the pursuit of McNair . <p> " I do n't think it 's going to be a problem for him stepping up and making that next move , " Jackson said . " He 's shown that he has the intelligence to do anything it takes to get the job done . " <p> More Hurdles Ahead <p> But there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Totten rewrote the Division I-AA record book when he played with Rice at Mississippi Valley State , but he never made it in the NFL . McNair 's older brother , Fred , who had a standout two-season career at Alcorn State in 1988 and 1989 , could n't catch on . McNair readily admits he learned everything from his brother . He even goes by " Air II , " since Fred was the original " Air " McNair . For Fred , who played in the Arena Football League last season and hopes to play in the World League of American Football this spring , Steve is a second chance at NFL glory . <p> " When I see him sometimes , I see some of the things that he does and I think it 's some of the stuff that I do , " Fred McNair said . <p> McNair has the arm , legs , eyes and brain , but sometimes it 's as if those qualities are all secondary to skin color . The doubts and stereotypes of black quarterbacks still exist . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Florida State , Mississippi and Miami wanted him to play defensive back when they came to recruit him out of high school . He had excelled at that position at Mount Olive ( Miss . ) High School , tying the state record of 30 interceptions set by Terrell Buckley . He also played baseball well enough to be drafted by the Seattle Mariners . But McNair wanted to play quarterback , and Alcorn State let him . <p> Black quarterbacks recently have made headway in the Heisman Trophy balloting , with Houston 's Andre Ware winning in 1990 and Florida State 's Charlie Ward winning last year . <p> But all it took was an entire NFL draft passing without Ward 's name being called to remind blacks that the battles fought by Williams and Warren Moon continue . <p> " I think there 's still a real big bias , " Nelson said . " Simply because there 's so many great black quarterbacks coming out of college right now , and those guys are n't getting an opportunity at all . " <p> So throw another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial barriers . <p> " Everybody has their dream , and my dream is to be the number one pick in the NFL , " McNair said . " I think if I do well as the first black quarterback to be picked in the NFL , it will start a long relationship with blacks in the NFL . " <p> He said this as he stood in the rain , signing autographs on the field of Alcorn State 's Spinks Stadium after the Texas Southern game . The day began with the public address announcer asking God to bless all those in attendance at the clean , two-year-old building , but to particularly bless McNair , the Heisman Trophy candidate . The homecoming crowd of 21,233 cheered every time the man wearing the No. 9 purple jersey trotted out to the huddle . They had watched McNair throw for 328 yards and four touchdowns , including one touchdown strike to his brother Tim . And even though McNair threw three interceptions , he did n't take out his frustrations on the kids , as he signed every piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , he still looks as if he is just one of the five children who grew up in Lucile McNair 's tiny house in Mount Olive , Miss . He 's in no rush , he does n't consider himself too important to take some time for his fans . It 's clear that his perspective is one of the few things that has n't been changed by all of the Heisman Trophy hoopla . <p> " If I do n't win it , life goes on , " McNair said . " It 's not the end of the world . "
