Peter Morrison and Leon Hendricks were drinking eighty-buck-a-bottle brut champagne in Morrison 's hot tub around midnight when something punched a hole in the sky over Beaverton . <p> The night was cold , but the heat rising from the water was enough to keep their ears from being nipped by December 's frosty teeth . Morrison was trying to get Hendricks to feed him some insider information on the new microbrewery offering hoping to get in on the ground floor . Hendricks was still half a bottle away from giving it up . Even over the Grateful Dead playing the Casey Jones cocaine song , they heard a sound kind of like a pencil poking through a sheet of Saran Wrap stretched over a bowl . <p> A real big pencil and a sheet of Saran Wrap maybe the size of , well , the midnight sky . <p> Both men looked up . <p> A bright , actinic , kind of . . . Maxfield Parrish light shined through the hole in the sky . After a second , a giant taloned finger poked through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more . Then a couple more fingers stretched the tear , until a whole hand made it halfway through . The hand , also a golden color , but more like pure , burnished 24-karat gold , pushed , and the sky gave way like soggy cardboard in a big , three-cornered tear . Made a hell of a racket . <p> Behind the space-time rent , a bald , golden gnome peered through the hole . It had big , purple eyes and an idiot grin . It only took a second for the thing to enlarge the hole enough to leap through . <p> Morrison figured the gnome must have been at least a couple hundred feet tall , though there was n't really anything to judge it against up there . <p> The golden idiot fell . Before it disappeared from view behind the fir trees in the side yard they could see that it was naked  --  and most assuredly male . <p> After a moment , the ground shook . Water sloshed out of the hot tub . Morrison grabbed the champagne bottle and Hendricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked . Five or six seconds later , there came a terrible ka-boom ! as the sound of the creature landing arrived . <p> " Now , there 's something you do n't see every day , " Morrison observed . <p> " Sounded like it must have come down right in the middle of town , " Hendricks said , " judging from how long it took the noise to get here . Eleven hundred feet a second , is n't it ? " <p> Morrison nodded . " About a mile , I 'd guess . More champagne ? " <p> Hendricks extended his glass . " Please . " <p> " Good champagne , " Hendricks said , after sipping the bubbly . <p> " Come on , tell me about the microbrewery . You know you want to . " <p> There was a fair amount of noise , not at all usual for midnight in Beaverton , Oregon . They rolled up the sidewalks at nine and even the Safeway was n't open all night . Whitebread Republicans tended to keep it down , usually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like . <p> " You do n't suppose that had anything to do with Sam Sewall , do you ? " Hendricks said . He waved . The hole in the sky was closing up . Another few seconds and you 'd never be able to tell it had been there . " You know , that business about him painting his house blue and it turning back to yellow overnight ? " <p> Sewall lived three houses down . Nice fella . Also hated the neighborhood association , which made him aces in Morrison 's book . Morrison took another goodly sip of his own wine . " No , I do n't think so . Sewall 's wife is a witch , and he forgot to ask her if he could paint the place . " <p> " Ah . Never a good idea to take the missus for granted . " <p> " Amen . " <p> Next door , the outside floodlights went on and Mr. Arlo McCartney , fifty and bald as an egg , ran from his house into the back yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison raised his eyebrows . <p> " Perhaps we should go in ? " Hendricks ventured . <p> " And have McCartney see us dangling our naked pendulums in the cold night air ? I think not . " <p> A dinosaur ran out of McCartney 's house , leaning forward tail extended behind it like a rudder , teeth clacking as it snapped its jaws shut . It looked around . Spied McCartney . <p> McCartney screamed and ducked behind the metal tool shed , then slid in between the shed and the wooden good-neighbor fence . <p> The dinosaur , about as tall as a pro basketball player  --  if you did n't count the tail  --  scrabbled at the edge of the shed , but could n't reach McCartney . <p> Score one for the bald guy . <p> " Help ! Help ! Somebody help ! " <p> " Velociraptor ? " Hendricks wondered aloud . <p> " Nah , T. rex . " <p> " Awfully small , is n't it ? I thought tyrannosaurs were bigger than that . " <p> " Well , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . And the tiny forelegs , that 's the giveaway . Maybe it 's a dwarf . Or a midget . " <p> " Ah . " <p> Frustrated at not being able to get to its prey , the dinosaur bleated . It sounded like a giant sheep . <p> " Spielberg sure got that part wrong , " Morrison said . He sipped at his champagne . <p> " Help ! Morrison ! Call the police ! Call the SPCA ! Call the goddamned Marines ! " <p> The dinosaur took a deep breath and blew it at McCartney . The breath came out as a burst of bright red-orange flame . <p> " Urk  --  ! " McCartney began . <p> Then he was reduced to a burnt-out cinder the size of a small toaster . Smoke rose from the little mound of ash . The air was filled with the smell of McDonald 's at noon . You want fries with that Big Mac ? <p> " Looks like both you and Spielberg were wrong , " Hendricks observed . " It 's not a Tyrannosaurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , looked at the two in the hot tub , shook its head , then went back into McCartney 's house . <p> " McCartney 's not married , is he ? " Hendricks asked . <p> " No . " <p> " Well , if it 's not Mrs. McCartney , then it is definitely a dragon . " <p> " I sit corrected , " Morrison said . He sighed . " But I am getting wrinkled . Maybe we should go inside . " <p> " Well , let 's finish the bottle first , shall we ? " <p> " You are going to tell me about the stock offering for that beer place ? " <p> " Since you 're twisting my arm , okay . " <p> " Now you 're talking . " Morrison waved at the CD player . " Put something else on , would you ? I do n't want to listen to Jerry and the boys wander around in minor chord-land for thirty minutes . " <p> " Sure . Stones ? Beatles ? " <p> " How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Hendricks grinned . " It does , does n't it ? " <p> " PETER MORRISON ! " came a thunderous voice from Heaven . <p> " That would be . . . God ? " Hendricks said . <p> " Be my guess , " Morrison said . " Hey , God , how 's it going ? " <p> " SAME OLD , SAME OLD . AND YOURSELF ? " <p> " Hey , I ca n't complain . Got the tub , my best friend who is going to help me make some money , really good French champagne . " <p> " MUST BE NICE , " God said . " I WOULD LOVE TO STAY AND VISIT BUT I HAVE TO GO NOW , DEITY 'S WORK IS NEVER DONE . " <p> " Thanks for dropping by , " Morrison said . He raised his glass in a silent toast . <p> " Been a long time since I talked to God , " Hendricks said . " Back in ' 70 , ' 71 . Most of the time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Morrison smiled . " Ah , yes , I 've had a conversation or two with Mr. Johnson myself . " <p> " Short conversations , no doubt , " Hendricks said . <p> " Speak for yourself , pal . Mine Wiener Schnitzel plumps when he heats up , just like those hot dogs on TV . Gets longer , too . Real long . " <p> " Do tell . And is this water cold ? " <p> " Internal heat , my man , internal heat . " <p> Grace Slick 's all-too-wise buttery voice floated from the speakers mounted on the outside wall of Morrison 's house , wrapped itself around the two men like the arms of a lover . Sang of pills that made you change your size . Sang of rabbits . Sang of psychedelic sights and sounds most people never knew . But places that were out there , all the same . <p> A pterodactyl soared overhead , and the spotlights picked it out . Ack-ack guns fired , hit the flying creature . It spiraled down and left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street . <p> " That Richards ' place it hit ? " <p> " So it appears . But  --  who can say ? " <p> Both men laughed . <p> " About finished with that wine ? " <p> " Last sip . " <p> " Here , I 'll get the towels . " <p> Both men stood . Glanced surreptitiously at each other . Not bad shape for ex-hippies in their late forties , they both figured . All things considered . <p> As a throbbing orange and green . . . something settled onto the house behind his and melted everything into a swirling widdershins puddle , Morrison said , " You know , I always knew the sixties would come in handy someday . " <p> Hendricks smiled , raised his hand , and gave Morrison the peace sign . <p> They went inside . <p> <p> By Steve Perry <p> Since his Star Wars novel , Shadows of the Empire , hit the New York Times bestseller list last spring , Steve Perry has poublished two other novels : The Trinity Vector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Digital Effect , which Ace will publish sometime this year <p> With " What the Dormouse Said , " Steve adds a bit of levity to the issue , especially for those of us who survived the 1960s . <p>
