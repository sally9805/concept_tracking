Section : INTERNATIONAL An inside report on why the Pentagon wants to send another 100,000 troops to the Persian Gulf <p> For nearly three months now , American military power has poured into the Persian Gulf , at a speed outstripping the U.S. buildup in Vietnam a generation ago . But last week the Pentagon announced , in effect , that it was n't enough . Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said much more muscle was needed " to deal with any contingency , " which included the possibility of offensive action to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait . The plan was to send the equivalent of at least two more mechanized divisions to join the 210,000 Americans already stationed in the desert or at sea . In all , Cheney said , the reinforcements might amount to as many as 100,000 troops , some of them drawn from U.S. garrisons in Western Europe . It will take at least another month to get the new units into place , which suggests that a military showdown with Iraq may not come until the turn of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buildup began at a time of growing uncertainty in the large but awkward alliance arrayed against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein . So far , economic sanctions and concerted diplomacy had failed to budge him from Kuwait , but to some , the military option looked even less promising . " We 're drifting , " said one source who has been deeply involved in planning the multinational operation in the gulf . " For the first time , there 's a sense that we 're not sure what to do next . " <p> This week Secretary of State James Baker plans to visit the region again to discuss the prospects for both military action and a peaceful settlement . Some of the Arab allies were unhappy about the lack of decisive action so far , and the Pentagon 's further delay for reinforcements did little to reassure them . " If we leave timing solely to the military , they will want to build up forever , " said a senior Arab source . " Of course , it 's always good to have more . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job tomorrow if we have to . " <p> Pentagon planners disagreed , but in a sense they were victims of their own success . For a month or more they had assiduously fostered the impression/hat the United States had massive combat forces in the desert , raring to go get Saddam . The reality was vastly more ambiguous . When the buildup began , the Pentagon tried to make it appear more rapid than it actually was , in order to deter an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia . Headlines announced the departure of a steady stream of Air Force and Army units destined for the gulf ; the small print said that only " elements of " the units had actually left . In many cases , the initial deployments consisted of little more than headquarters companies , followed by the numerous support personnel needed to prepare for the arrival of combat forces , which often turned up weeks later . " It was a bluff , and it worked , " says a top military planner . " But now we 're paying the price . Everyone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weeks . That 's just not the case . " <p> From the start , the Air Force buildup had an offensive capability . Although it deployed ground-attack planes to fight off an invasion by Iraqi tanks , the Air Force decided that the best defense is a good offense  --  tactical strikes against Iraqi logistics , bombing of Iraq 's war-supporting industries . About 30 B-52 bombers were ordered to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia only hours after Bush spoke by telephone to Saudi King Fahd on Aug. 2 , the day of Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , even though the bombers took only the munitions they could carry with them . <p> The U.S. Army 's role , in contrast , was almost purely defensive . The first unit to deploy in force was the lightly armed but fast-moving 82nd Airborne Division , which is not equipped to stop Iraq 's Soviet-made T-72 tanks . " The 82nd was a tripwire , no more , " a senior Pentagon official acknowledges . " Its presence told Saddam Hussein that to conquer Saudi Arabia , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier units arrived ; by now the force includes the equivalent of three mechanized divisions . But the Army was still configured for defense . If Bush is to have a credible offensive military option , officials say , the Army needs a radical change of plan and a lot more punch , including another 400 to 500 heavy tanks and engineer troops to help them operate on the attack . <p> The initial buildup closely followed a contingency plan drawn up by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf , now the U.S. commander in the region . Schwarzkopf 's top priority was always to get warplanes in first , for the obvious reason that it 's the quickest way to deploy firepower . But the planners underestimated the amount of support equipment the Air Force would need : tons of highly sensitive testing equipment , for example , plus computers to monitor the testing gear and cooling equipment to keep the computers running . The upshot was that Air Force needs pre-empted U.S. airlift capability for nearly all of the first month . <p> As a result , the overall buildup took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own forces in Kuwait , from about 100,000 in early August to around 430,000 now . " We 're aiming at a moving target , " says a U.S. planner . " We have to put enough out there to counter what Saddam 's got . And he keeps upping the ante . " At first , the Iraqis were deployed for a possible attack on Saudi Arabia . But in mid-September , Saddam moved his forces into a multilayered defensive posture , with infantry , artillery and tanks dug in behind minefields and earthworks . <p> Initially the Pentagon accepted the Air Force view that Saddam could be defeated entirely from the air . " It was an expedient belief , " admits a Pentagon planner . " Air power would be cheaper in U.S. lives . And besides , we did n't have the forces in-theater for a ground option . " Now the Joint Chiefs of Staff have reached the sober judgment that air power by itself will not suffice . A ground attack by armored forces will be needed to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Battle plan : Still , if Bush decides on the offensive option , the attack will begin with a massive aerial assault , sources say . The plan is to mount 1,700 combat sorties in the opening two days . The first priorities are Saddam 's communications and his extended-range Scud missiles aimed at Israel ; the assumption is that his immediate response to a U.S. assault would be to try to widen the conflict by attacking Israel . The second priority is to knock out Iraq 's other surface-to-surface missile batteries , which could hit targets in Saudi Arabia . Then American planes would destroy-power stations , knocking out the electricity for military bases and sending a message to the Iraqi people . That done , simultaneous assaults would be launched against Iraq 's air defenses and its armored forces . Plants developing nuclear , chemical and biological weapons also would be targeted , but not all of them have been located so far . <p> The projected loss rate in early operations is around 7 percent , dropping to 3 percent or less as Iraqi air defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans have at least one edge . Iraq 's best air-to-air missiles are the French-made R-530 Super and R-550 Magic , formidable weapons when fired from their Mirage F-1s . But NEWSWEEK has learned that France has told Washington how to jam the missiles . <p> Iraq 's armored forces are so well dug in that fighter-bombers will have a hard time knocking them out . B-52s will get that job , and the current plan is to send about 20 more of them to the Cairo West base in Egypt . The theory is that when the B-52s attack armored forces , their 2,000-pound bombs will set off tremors in the sand , burying dug-in tanks . The Air Force estimates that by D-plus-5 ( the sixth day of hostilities ) it can " attrit " half of Iraq 's armor . Knocking out the rest will require ground forces . The tactic now favored is for U.S. tanks to breach the Iraqi defenses on one or more narrow salients and then fan out to fight a mobile campaign . That would force surviving Iraqi tanks to come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point , U.S. air power can kill the Iraqi tanks out in the open . " You use armor to force him to move , then you use air power to kill him , " says one military source . <p> The Pentagon hopes Saddam will fold once his forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq have been crippled . If he does n't surrender , no U.S. or other Western ground forces will be sent into Iraq . Instead , sources say , the Americans will try to talk their Arab allies into sending tank columns toward Baghdad . " It will be called Arab peacekeeping force , " one diplomat says , deadpan . So far , the Saudis and the Egyptians , among others , say they will not send forces across the border into Iraq . In any case , the reality is that such a campaign would only be possible after U.S. air power and ground forces have knocked out the elite of Saddam Hussein 's Army . <p> GRAPH : Quick Reaction American troops have arrived in the gulf at a much faster rate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The first wave waits in the desert : Soldiers shave at daybreak , members of the 82nd Airborne Division fire a Dragon antitank missile <p> BY JOHN BARRY <p>
