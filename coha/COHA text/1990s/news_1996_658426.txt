<p> Irina Golir stands in front of a map in a Boston subway station trying to make sense of the multicolored lines tracing the trains ' routes . Turning from the map , she stops two women and asks in a Spanish accent for directions . <p> This Argentine visitor is just one of millions of foreigners who travel to the United States each year . In 1994 , over 45 million tourists came to America , generating $ 60 billion in revenue , up from $ 17 billion brought in by 27 million visitors 10 years earlier . Though their reasons for chosing the US can be as diverse as their respective cultures , they also share some common perceptions of this country . <p> For Ms. Golir , who is from Santa Fe , Argentina , visiting this country is a dream come true . " I always wanted to know the American way of life , " she says . <p> Carl Bromley from Portsmouth , England , has long had the same goal . The British graduate student 's interest in the US began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips and watched cartoons . <p> The American ' film set ' <p> When he finally arrived on US soil , he says , he had a feeling of instant familiarity with the landmarks . Mr. Bromley describes the experience as " the shock of seeing something you 've always seen , but experiencing it firsthand . " His visit to the US was like stepping " onto a film set . " <p> For him , the " film set " of America has its roots in Los Angeles : " Los Angeles is the dream factory where everything is produced , " he says . Recalling his visit to Hollywood , he says , " The feeling was overwhelming . I had to consume all these images . " <p> Bromley is not alone in wanting to experience tinsel world . Nestor D'Angelo from Rosario , Argentina , says Hollywood 's portrayal of the American dream , in part , draws some Argentines to the US . " A lot of people come to the US every year looking to ... experience the American dream ... and the films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet the American travel experience also involves a few unexpected frustrations . Among the annoyances for Bromley are figuring out how to use pay phones and the New York bus service , which he describes as confusing . <p> For other tourists , misconceptions about the distance between major cities causes problems in planning . <p> There is often the perception , for example , that Los Angeles and San Francisco are an hour apart , explains Mary Thompson of the San Francisco Visitor Information Center ( SFVIC ) . In fact , it 's about a seven-hour drive . <p> Public transit hassles <p> Simply getting around within the United States can be a challenge for many tourists because of the lack of sufficient public transportation - both within certain cities and to areas outside cities such as national parks that are difficult to reach without a car . <p> Although Los Angeles ranks as the second most popular city visited by overseas tourists , some are now choosing not to go there because of the transportation hassles . <p> " The consensus of opinion among a whole mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting Los Angeles because public transportation makes it very difficult , " says traveler Liam Murphy , a retiree from Glasgow , Scotland . " It 's not a place you can freely travel in like Boston or San Francisco . " <p> Along with public transportation , safety is a key issue among international visitors . This has been a growing concern in the wake of a series of violent incidents against tourists in Florida . But others seem less worried about the dangers . <p> Helmut and Helga Herzog , traveling from Ulm , Germany , say they " always felt safe " during their two-week visit on the East Coast . Mr. Herzog says , however , " My wife was a little afraid in Manhattan , so we avoided in the evening passing strange quarters . " <p> For the most part , Mr. Murphy felt safe during his travels except for an experience in New Orleans . One evening , the native of Scotland recalls , he felt extremely uncomfortable when he went for a walk at 7 p.m. and found no one else outside on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , including the police , had retreated inside . When Murphy returned to his hotel , he was told that it " was very silly " to go out alone . <p> Some tourists have other unexpected concerns . Bromley , for example , is worried about unanticipated expenses . The British graduate student wonders about health-care costs if he were to get into an accident in the US . Health care in the US , he says , is far more costly than in England . <p> A feeling of friendliness <p> Despite safety concerns , a number of tourists say Americans readily roll out the welcome mat . <p> Golir says she aways thought of large cities in the US as dangerous , where " nobody cares what happens to you . " The Argentine , who is visiting Boston for a month , says she is finding the opposite . " The people are very friendly and answer everything and help you if you need help . " <p> The Herzogs also notice the warmth of Americans . Mr. Herzog says the kindness and " gentleness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendliness of shop workers , are unique to the US . <p> Bromley , however , challenges the sincerity of Americans ' friendliness . He says the store employees seem to be " overbearingly nice . " Their eagerness to help appears " superficial " to the British citizen accustomed to the reserved nature of England 's store workers . <p> For Murphy , a lack of friendliness and helpfulness was more frustrating than overeagerness to help . He says his visit to Atlanta was not as enjoyable , in part , because of the lack of help from one of the tourist information offices . At this office , he explains , every information pamphlet was behind the information desk rather than in easy reach . <p> The employees of the tourist information office , he says , " seemed to be impatient with an ordinary guy asking questions . You had to do that because they the pamphlets were behind the counter . " He says because he did not want to " annoy " the employee too much , he ended up leaving with insufficient information . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main reasons some tourists come to the US is to shop . <p> For the Japanese , shopping , skiing , or playing golf in the US is cheaper than staying home and doing the same activities in Japan , explains Isao Kato , staff assistant of administration for Japan Airlines . For instance , one tie in Japan can cost from US$ 80 to US$ 90 , Kato says . Japanese tourists " come here once in a lifetime ... and ... they are really well-informed ... on where to go for handbags , cosmetics , " he adds . <p> Japanese tourists , who tend to be from the younger and the older generations , used to travel to the US in the 1980s in large tour groups and remained with their group throughout the visit . Many Japanese tourists now specialize by going off in smaller tour groups to ski or play golf at Pebble Beach , Calif. , explains Kato . <p> Unlike the Japanese tourists , one of Murphy 's main reasons for visiting the US was to sightsee . But he says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical sites made it difficult to visit many places . <p> He suggests that if several museums and attractions were grouped together and sold under one price , it would be more affordable for a number of international tourists . <p> But how easy is it to get around in the US if you do not speak English ? <p> Some tourists , such as those from Japan , have a translator . Those without translators can hope to find publications in their native language at visitor centers . Ms. Thompson of SFVIC says it is very easy to find native speakers of your own language in San Francisco . She says SFVIC 's staff is multilingual and publications are translated in four different languages . Not all major cities have the same level of services , however . <p> Commenting on his five visits to the US , Bromley says he thinks of them more as adventures than sightseeing trips . <p> " If you regard tourism as some sort of thing to take in a few beauty spots , there is no adventure to it . It 's mundane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see travel as an adventure and you want to be changed , then America is the best place for that , " says Bromley .
