IN CENTRAL NEW YORK SPRING UNFOLDS as slowly as the fiddlehead ferns that lay a pale green carpet on the floor of the woods . The relentless white of January and February suffocates optimism , and the disappointing sleet and mud of March and April threaten a person 's confidence . I know this is true , for all of my seasons have passed here in this unsympathetic region , all of my years on this sheep farm , my home . It is here , in this farmhouse on Pike Road in the town of Donohue Flats , that I was born ninety years ago . It is here  --  I hope on a warm and sunny day  --  that I expect to die . Not now , not in May , when cheerful birds build their nests and daffodils bob their heads above the pliant ground , but soon . Esther shushes me when I say things like that . I 'm her Social Services assignment and what a tough one I must be . What with these locked-up bones , I can ' hardly get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse , but she gives me my medication and bathes this pink crepe paper called skin . She cooks my breakfast and sweeps my floor just as spotlessly as she would her own , and before she leaves each day she sits next to this bed , which has been moved for purposes of convenience into the parlor , and reads me The Evening Star . So here I am , living in the house where I was born , waiting for patient Esther to tend my needs . My lifeline is dangerously frayed , but my mind is sharper than a cat 's eye ; I remember . Though my body is brittle and dry , my vision is clear , and my ears , trying hard to hear , wiggle and twitch . But my own voice has betrayed me . Once a melodiously sculpted soprano , it is now no more beautiful than the cackle of an old hen . Still , Esther listens to these rambles , these little memories I 've jotted down in this journal , the few stories I am willing to share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been saying things I do n't like to hear , things about the Pine Manor Home over in Wichner and how much easier my life would be there . Esther is golden . She says , " I worry about you , Miss Leahy , alone all night long . What if something goes wrong ? " The camera of an old woman 's mind shoots from many angles . " Joe will bark , " I answer , knowing full well that the old border collie has all but lost the desire to bark and even if he did , no one would hear him . My nearest neighbor is half a mile away . " Just help me into the bathroom every night before you leave . " I laugh . " I do n't plan on getting out of this bed , " I lie , for that , sooner or later , is exactly what I plan to do . I will go up the stairs to the attic , where buried in one of the neatly stacked cardboard boxes is a gift I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tremble over the layers of cream she massages into my skin . Perhaps it will brighten her sad eyes . " You would be safer at Pine Manor , " she tells me . As if I would ever leave my farm . Young women like Esther with two sweet children and a husband who works hard enough , but does , I suspect , take a long nip now and then , would claw the walls until their fingers were bloodied nubs before they would allow themselves to be stripped from their homes , transported to a warehouse like Pine Manor . So , she should know , would a childless old spinster like me . THIS FARMHOUSE WAS BUILT IN 1845 IN THE center of eighty-five , half-wooded rolling acres . It was a small and self-contained farm , but now its fields and pastures are fallow and overgrown . Damaged remnants of fieldstone fences limp through the trees  --  maple and cherry , oak and poplar , hemlock , beech , and the wild apples . Rugged Germans first cleared this land , leveling the dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horses , plowing up fieldstones like bones in a cemetery . With hands for machines and back-breaking labor , they used those rocks to build four-foot high , geometrically-perfect fences . As proficient as trained masons , they selected each fieldstone like a poet selects her words . They laid the flat stones one atop the other for miles and miles through the woods until the cows and the sheep could , finally , be allowed to roam . How did their muscles survive the labor , their skin the blistering sun ? Their suffering will remind us of the past , forever  --  until bulldozers raid this land , obliterating the achievements of an era . The man who built our house and cleared our fields and built the stone walls , certainly drove himself hard . Having completed his mission here in New York , he gathered his family and abandoned the state in 1859 . My father 's eyes sometimes glistened when he told the story of this German immigrant whose land and home we had acquired , how he packed up his belongings and moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built another post-and-beam house , more stone walls . I 've always wondered why he left New York to start all over again . He had built a beautiful home , and the barns and the pastures and orchards were clear of rocks . Did he leave because of the hard weather ? Or was it the acidic soil of this region where field crops are limited to cabbage and corn ? Could it have been that he was simply bored ? The German had an engineer 's mind . The house is sited precisely to benefit from the most southern sun and the high ridge to the north side protects against the killer winds . My father 's building skills were comparatively limited , but his carpentry was adequate and the barns and wagons were not in disrepair . Father understood the meaning of maintenance , and to keep the farm in forward motion he adequately taught himself the art of reconstruction . When Mother complained that the house was too dark , he put windows where there were none . The forest is visible from every room and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted to stay , new leaves accessorize my father 's handiwork like lime-colored curtains and white tufts of the early flowers sway from tender shadbush branches . I stare out this window next to my bed and yes , I do remember other seasons , other times . The seasons are still intact ; to hope for more than that is a foolish exertion . THE WINTER OF 1911 HAD BEEN ICILY fierce , the worst I could remember . It was the first time in my eleven years that I recognized the wintry hazards stalking the unprepared . The hills across the valley , normally a clear view from our kitchen window , stayed obscurely gray , blanketed for months in dense , wet fog . Even the snow that fell that year seemed dark and heavy , and night after night the hot soapstone my mother tucked under my quilt was as cold as a block of ice by morning . But finally the wretched winter released its hold on the land and the waters of the great annual thaw could be heard advancing through the woods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season were everywhere . The flocks of geese had already sailed up from the south , honking high above the fields in fluid patterns . The cherry trees toasted the woods , their leaf buds as promising and colorful as a glass of red wine . But not until the shadbushes bloomed did I begin to believe that it was safe to embrace spring . The other sure sign that winter was defeated , the arrival of millions of small , black , flying insects , had already commenced . Some call them punkies , or mayflies , or black flies , or no-see-ums , but in our part of the county they 're known as shadflies . They travel in clouds around an unprotected head , drilling bloody holes into its flesh . Farmers who repair fences in early May sport the badge of the spring season  --  itchy , angry red welts around the edge of their hats . Mother always said it showed God 's sense of humor that the shadbush and the shadfly come out on exactly the same day of the month , but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father invited me to go turkey hunting . It 's painted in glossy colors on my memory , for my father was a solitary man , and when he felt the need for a companion , he always chose his younger brother Alton . More than once my mother had asked him to take her for a walk in the woods surrounding our house . " Let 's go down to the hemlocks tomorrow , like we used to , " she would say . But tomorrow was always packed with other things to do and I ca n't remember them ever taking a walk together . Father genuinely loved his brother , and so , as a result , did I. But the world seemed to baffle my Uncle Alton . His head sank deep between his shoulder blades as if he were trying to hide , and though he worked hard and steadily , his clothes never changed and his money was scarce . Around the farm Uncle Alton was as common as a field mouse , but he rarely ate supper at our table , preferring , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery in Donohue Flats , a few small rooms where he was free to play his fiddle , drink from an amber bottle , eat out of a pot . Primarily , it was a place free of the disapproving gaze of my mother , who never was able to see her brother-in-law 's merits , no matter what he did to show them to her . So it was more than a surprise when Father asked me , rather than my uncle , to go turkey hunting with him . He himself had not gone for years . According to my mother , he quit hunting the year that Billy died . I was two and my brother was four when it happened . What I remember of that day has been bleached by time . In some osmosis of childish comprehension I knew that Billy was dead , though not for many years did I know what killed him . I suppose I 'd heard of the " summer complaint , " a diagnostic phrase we used before penicillin was available . Many people , and animals too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a tall and gangly teenager before I would learn that the medicine of the century could not have saved my brother 's life . Only the Savior could have rescued the boy , and He was apparently in no mood for children . But I 'll hold my tongue on that subject , lest my heathen thoughts conjure up young Reverend Thorne again . That man appears at my door with the regularity of a housefly , and I have no desire to be pestered by him right now . I still have one tintype of Billy and me sitting on a velvet chair , me with ribbons in my sausage curls . My baby legs are pudgy stumps peeking from under a flowing dress . Billy looks sickly with large , indifferent eyes , and neither of us is smiling . He 's buried under an apple tree between Father and Mother on the top of a hill overlooking the house . So is Molly , my best sheep dog . I do n't think I 'll ever again walk the hill to the Leahy cemetery , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago like the guardian I am . From the window next to this bed I can see how they are untended now , unpruned , overtaken with burdocks and thistles and matted grass . Reverend Thorne offered to tend the overgrown graves , but I told him I had a gardener for such tasks . Of course that is a lie , but the last thing I want is one of God 's men working for me . It 's a hypocrite who calls on God when death is lurking at the foot of the bed . The man 's presence makes me nervous ; his kindness makes me wary . That particular spring day when Father asked me to go turkey hunting had been a gift to us all after the unusually hard winter . Even the lines in Mother 's face were smooth , the corners of her lips tipped up . It was after supper , and Father was in a good frame of mind . He leaned back in his chair , letting his right hand dangle almost to the floor to scratch Molly 's pointy little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county , Ginny . Sure did hit the spot , " he said , stroking his beard clean of crumbs . I dallied awhile before clearing the table to bask in the pleasure of the cozy kitchen . Molly swung her black and white tail across the floor , mopping the same semicircle back and forth , back and forth , when all of a sudden Father sat up straight as a stick and clapped his hands hard . The dog bolted behind the cook stove . It sounded like a shot and I could n't blame her for panicking . She was n't gun-shy like some dogs , but she did jump out of her skin once in a while . For a minute even I thought something bad had happened . But Father was looking at Mother with a big , silly grin on his face , and his eyes flashed excitedly . Startled , she said too loudly , " William Leahy ! What in the world is the matter with you ? " She probably thought it had something to do with her supper that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew because I was the one who killed the chicken . " I just had a very good idea , Ginny . " He made his eyes go big and round like silver dollars , and that fast they were smiling at each other again , though neither had the kind of teeth you might see in the Sears catalog . Father had taken a personal dislike to the new dentist in town , and my mother 's smile was of the tight-lipped variety , so her dark and missing teeth were usually well hidden . " Reeni , " he practically yelled , " How about you and me going for a turkey tomorrow . You want to , girl ? It 's about time I showed my daughter a gobbler , and I heard one up above the house early this morning . " Well , Mother 's face darkened the room like a window shade , and I wondered uneasily why Father did n't know better than to suggest such a thing . I rose to my feet slowly and Molly , magically sensing a storm , crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had opened this rabbit hutch and I was n't about to close it . I knew exactly what my mother would have to say about her girl hunting turkeys or anything else . It was all right for me to clean a stall , slop a hog , or wring a chicken 's neck , but my mother did not want me to carry a gun . " Too dangerous , " she would say , gazing out the window at the tree tops on the other side of the pond . " Everything is too dangerous . " Still , I wanted to learn how to shoot more than anything else on earth . I had been reading about the wild west in school and for a whole year restricted by book reports to Annie Oakley and the Buffalo Girls . In the end , of course , I could shoot the eye out of a peacock , if I had to , but that was a skill I developed many years later . If I had the strength to hold up a shotgun now , I might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped the dish water . Her hands were quite large but the grip had gone bad . She was not a small-boned woman and her muscles were unattractively bulky . Every morning she coiled a thick pale braid out of the way on the top of her head . I could not have known then that in twenty-five years I would resemble her so closely , that long after she was dead , my own reflection would suddenly bring tears of contrition and loss . It was at this moment , on the eve of the adventure with my father , that I first saw my mother with what I would come to know later as the clear eyes of the wild turkey . The taste of how complicated it might be to grow into a woman dried my mouth . The evening had taken a strange turn and the dishes remained dirty on the table while Father and I waited to hear what she might say . I pulled loose strings from the hem of my damp apron . Mother 's was stained with the day . Its rusty color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp and flat . Finally she turned away from the sink , put her hands on her hips and said , " William , for heaven 's sake ! There is no need for Irene to go turkey hunting . " His face fell down to the floor , and my eye started to twitch the way it still does to this day , when events warrant such a weakness . " Ginny , " he said softly , " she wo n't be carrying a gun . I 'm just going to see if we can find a turkey , that 's all . No gun . " Exasperated , she looked at him hard . " Oh , all right . Get to bed early then , " she surrendered . I tried to hug her , but she turned away and it was Molly who followed me up the stairs to my room .
