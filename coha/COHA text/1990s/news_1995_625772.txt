<p> For 28 years , King Hill either played quarterback or coached quarterbacks in the NFL . He spent 11 years of his 16-year coaching career with the Oilers , and even though he left the NFL to become a vice president at Tour 18 , he attends Oilers games at the Astrodome and watches them on television . <p> Because of his background as a quarterback , Hill has paid special attention to Steve McNair since he played at Alcorn State . Early this season , Hill said he thought the Oilers were handling McNair the correct way by letting him watch and learn until the coaches thought he was ready to play . <p> Hill witnessed McNair 's Astrodome debut against Detroit in which he connected on 16 of 27 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown with one interception . Like everyone else , he was excited about the quarterback 's performance , but experience tells Hill that the fans should be cautious in their expectations . <p> " " I was impressed by what he did against Detroit , " Hill says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of one game . It 's way too soon to draw conclusions . " <p> When he was an assistant with the Oilers , Hill coached such quarterbacks as Dan Pastorini , Lynn Dickey , Jerry Rhome , Charley Johnson , John Hadl and Kenny Stabler . <p> " " Now that Steve 's starting against the Jets , he 's under a different type of pressure because of that responsibility , " Hill says . " " The backup does not face that kind of pressure . <p> When a backup plays , everything is gravy . " <p> Hill analyzes McNair as a coach , the same way as Rhome , the Oilers ' offensive coordinator . <p> " " I was real impressed with Steve 's poise , " Hill says . " " When he <p> made a mistake , like the interception and fumbled snap , he did n't get rattled . When a quarterback shows poise under pressure , it helps his teammates believe in him . A quarterback needs his teammates to help him make plays . <p> " " I expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to make quick decisions , and that 's difficult for a lot of experienced quarterbacks . " <p> Hill wants to evaluate McNair over the last three games and see where the quarterback stands going into the offseason . <p> " " The proof is going to be in his three-game review , " he says . <p> " " Usually , playing well is not enough because a quarterback has to win games . The Oilers have him in the right situation . <p> Playing in Jerry 's offense is good for Steve because patience is important . <p> " " Even though Steve has outstanding mobility , Jerry does n't want him to look to run . Blockers need to know where the quarterback is . That has to come naturally . That was part of Steve Young 's problem early in his career . He wanted to run at the first sign of trouble , and that 's discouraging to the receivers and linemen . I think it slowed his progress . <p> " " The more experience Steve gets , the more comfortable he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll learn how to use his running ability . And when he does , he 'll become even more effective . " <p> Jeffires salutes fans - Because the Oilers are playing what should be their last game ever in Houston , receiver Haywood Jeffires wants to do something special for the fans right after the game . <p> At the final gun , Jeffires is thinking about going into the stands to shake hands with the fans , or he might run around the perimeter of the Astrodome slapping hands with them . He is hoping some of his teammates will join him . <p> " " I love our fans , and I want to shake hands with as many of them as possible to show my appreciation for the way they 've supported me and the team through the years , " Jeffires says . <p> " " The fans who come to this game are the ones who have been the most loyal . I want them to remember me as more than a football player . " <p> Dobler , Banks honor Young - Guard Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth consecutive time this week , will receive the first Bob Young Memorial Award before the Jets game . Matthews gets a trophy and a trip for two to Las Vegas . The award is a tribute to Young , who died of a heart attack in June . <p> In a class move , the Oilers provided tickets and parking passes to Young 's family and friends and cleared time before kickoff for Dr. Mickey Bush to present the award in honor of her late husband . Joining Bush on the sideline will be Young 's long-time friend , Paul Somerville , and two of Young 's St. Louis Cardinals ' teammates , Conrad Dobler and Tom Banks . Young , Dobler , Banks and Dan Dierdorf were part of the offensive line that set the NFL record for fewest sacks in a season . <p> Dishing it out - This week , the Oilers elected a player representative for the second time this season . <p> Cornerback Cris Dishman beat out special-teams star John Henry Mills in the first election . Dishman resigned the position , and kicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " I resigned because of undue circumstances , " Dishman said . " " I want to thank my campaign manager , Steve Jackson , for helping me get elected , but now it 's time for me to step aside . " <p> When Jackson was asked about Dishman 's resignation , he said , " " If I knew then what I know now about skeletons in his closet , I never would have accepted the position . " <p> And what were the " " undue circumstances " that caused Dishman to resign ? Seems the NFLPA did some checking and found out he does n't pay his $ 5,000 union dues . <p> Long-distance connection - Speaking of Al Del Greco , the kicker is quietly having an outstanding season . <p> Although he did not attempt a field goal for three consecutive games this month , he has connected on 22-of-26 and has scored 95 points . <p> More impressive is that Del Greco ranks second in three statistics . His average attempt is 38.7 yards . His average make is 37.1 yards . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take pride in that my field-goal percentage is fourth , " Del Greco says . " " I led the league last year in average distance on the field goals I made . Being so high two years in a row means I 'm not getting a lot of short attempts . When we 've gotten in the red zone , we 've been either real good at scoring touchdowns or real bad by committing turnovers . " <p> Fisher among top three - In this week 's edition of Pro Football Weekly , the magazine analyzes the jobs done this season by the first-year coaches . Jeff Fisher is rated third behind Philadelphia 's Ray Rhodes and Carolina 's Dom Capers . <p> The car collector - Not much is made about the people behind the scenes who will lose money after the Oilers leave Houston . Two in particular - Myron Chestnut and Harvey Strain of the Car Cleaning Network - will have more time available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons . <p> Chestnut 's company is in its eighth year of detailing cars for the players at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp every year . When asked this week about the most generous player to employ them , they said receiver Haywood Jeffires . In his ninth season , Jeffires has owned two Ferraris , two Jaguars , a Lexus , a Jeep Cherokee and a Ford Explorer . <p> NOTES
