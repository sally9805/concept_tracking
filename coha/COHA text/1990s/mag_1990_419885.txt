Laughter is the medium of preference for Charles Parness as he examines the world around him <p> DURING THIS PAST DECADE , WHEN MUCH OF THE MOST HIGHLY TOUTED ART HAS BEEN SATURATED WITH TRITE APPROPRIATIONS , TEPID IRONIES , PUFFED-UP ANGST , AND NARCISSISTIC GESTURING , WE HAVE SEEN FAR TOO LITTLE EVIDENCE OF GENUINE MIRTH AND SATIRIC BITE IN CONTEMPORARY ART . <p> But such works are out there . Wayne Thiebaud has continued his explorations of the phallic aspects of lipstick , the bizarre , surrealistic quality of our pastries , and invented those sly , Road Runner compressions of the streets of San Francisco . Beyond the variations on his own likeness , Robert Arneson has mercilessly mined the countenances of our heroes and politicians , and explored the personages of the legendary figures and momentous events of modern art . Red Grooms has retold Picasso 's banquet for Henri Rousseau , those now mythical nights at the Cedar Bar , and created an endless variety of send-ups of the masters of art and film . Peter Saul has relentlessly skewered our public figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his work is less well known , Charles Parness has produced an hilarious , ongoing parade of self-portraits over the past fifteen years . <p> These perspicacious and uncannily accurate representations chronicle the artist in an endless variety of hats , caps , masks , disguises , and props , and in an astounding array predicaments . It is immediately paintings that Parness is a devotee of old-time , hit'em on the head slapstick ... W.G. Fields , Marx Brothers , Three Stooges , Mel Brooks , Monty Python , and John Cleese ... and that he eschews all esoterica and signs of self importance in his work . He is Quixote in a Hawaiian shirt , armed with a day-glo bat ... the protagonist of a thousand bizarre plots ... the disheveled hero of a surreal assortment of cliff-hangers . And like those old-time heroes of the Saturday morning serials , we are let in on these bits of make-believe ; just as the strings were visible and the tin rockets spewed sparks , the assortment of monsters Parness encounters are all implausible ' plastic frauds . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ongoing series of small oils and pastels , and the second being the large , narrative paintings . <p> In the small canvases and pastels , Parness portrays himself as a quirky assortment of characters and in an endless assortment of disguises . We see him looking suspiciously askance from a green , hooded slicker against a backdrop Samaras-like rain ... in an old aviators cap being buzzed by two menacing toy planes ... in a tropical landscape with his face half covered by a pig mask ... as a bearded Indian holding a troy which is in the process of devouring Mickey Mouse ... acting out the monkey 's roles of " see no evil , speak no evil , hear no-evil " ... and suspiciously approaching an orthodox appearance as he examines a small , pink flamingo . These self-portraits are reminiscent of medieval icons depicting obscure saints who hold wheels , flayed skins , broadaxes , and other devises of their martyrdom , but are given a contemporary and somewhat existential spin . As Popeye would say , " I yam what I yam . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allegorical . Along with the artist , they are inhabited by an assortment of inflatable dinosaurs , monsters , robots , and animals , and move from representations of his mirrored and often disguised likeness to depictions of skange events . <p> In Leaping Lizards , Parness , who has stolen a baby alligator and dinosaur , is being pursued by a six-foot-tall Godzilla and a toothy , speckled crocodile . He is clad in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt , and wears a crocodile hat , which implies a shared ancestral heritage with these ancient lizards , and he flees through a landscape that is a mix of idyllic Vermont scenery and Frederic Church 's primeval Cotopaxi . The edginess of ship predicament is blunted , as always , by clear depiction of the prehistoric monsters as kitschy inflatable . <p> The same inflatable Godzilla appears in Monster Mash , which is a zany , contemporary variation on St. George and the dragon . Parness , in the same Hawaiian shirt and shorts , and armed only with a plastic bat , thrashes the daylights out of this gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Often , these allegories are transliterations of real events . Summer houseguests with a small child led to Baby Boom , where Parness is seen wailing and waving his arms as he attempts to flee a field full of ill-tempered , tottering , diapered babies , all shrieking and thrashing their arms . This small , bleating guest 's stuffed Mickey Mouse appears in Pied Piper , but it has multiplied into legions of smiling Mickeys and Minnies . They are being led away by a shifty-eyed Parness , who is wearing a straw bowler and is playing a flute . Parness 's ferocious black and white cat , Roddy , is perched on the Piper 's shoulder and stares back at the procession of vacuous-eyed mice , completely fixated on the grand windfall of this prospective feast . <p> In Food for Thought , Parness floats in a quiet sea just beyond the deck of a brightly colored Chinese junk . He is decked out in a chef 's cap and holds up a hot dog . The water is filled with a variety of junk food ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries spill from the sky . Two slices of pepperoni pizza protrude from the water like shark fins , but it is the un-biodegradable garbage that seems to pose a far more serious threat . Then the smiling , chef-capped , and angel-winged painter offers a savory helping of stir-fried shrimp from a wok in Heavenly Host . He stands beside the range , in a heaven somewhere beyond the moon , and sports a chef 's cap encircled by a halo of shrimp . Lobsters , leeks , and carrots rain from the night sky . <p> Three other paintings also dwell on the spiritual side of life . We see an open mouthed , disbelieving Parness scanning the sky with binoculars as a squadron of cherubs ... all clones of the artist .. pass overhead in The Saints Go Marching By ( not shown ) . Soul Searching ( not shown ) shows the painter in a camouflaged shirt and hunter 's cap preparing to take aim on a naked , surprised Parness-cherub above . Then a saintly Parness gestures heavenward toward a golden0-winged cherub ... also a self-portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Peaceable Kingdom ( not shown ) spoofs the Edward Hicks classic of the , same title . Here , Parness , in a top hat , reclines on the back of a sloe-eyed milk cow against a backdrop of rolling Vermont mountains . He and his kine are surrounded by a menagerie of inflatable animals ... a brightly colored macaw perched on the head of a gorilla , a pink rabbit munching a carrot , a striped cat nuzzling a snake ... and a red , white , and blue robot , which symbolically connects the past , present and future . In another send-up of a classical theme Garden of Earthly Delights ( not shown ) , the painter frolics in the basin of a tropical waterfall with his inflatable rabbit , dinosaur , and alligator apparently oblivious to the voluptuous beauties bathing behind him . <p> All of these fantasies are triggered by an assortment of real-life situations , formal maneuvers , and responses to the art of the past . Backward Into the Abyss is a typical combination of such factors . While on a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican artist , Jose Clemente Orozco , and in particular a work depicting a painter engulfed in fire , which was entitled Bad Artist . Later , a Polaroid photograph of the artist hanging upside down from the Vermont porch came out with yellow streaks and smears , reminiscent of Orozco 's flames , and this led to Parness 's variation , in which he falls through an inferno ... beard , T-shirt , and shorts in flame ... surrounded by snarling , snapping , green-scaled pteranodon . <p> These paintings are best encountered en masse , for there is a pithiness and an extravagance in the caprices orchestrated by Charles Parness that is more clearly grasped when his oeuvre is considered as an autobiographical , episodic adventure . Their effect is cumulativeAnd like all myths , these delightful fantasies and foibles point inward , toward the more gritty and fragile truths of the human predicament . <p> The preceding catalog essay by John Arthur accompanied a two-part exhibition , " Charles Parness : Paintings and Pastels , " which was seen during April and May at the Butler Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W.
