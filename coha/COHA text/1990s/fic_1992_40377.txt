" But the bottom line is , it was worth hearing . <p> " As to the morality involved , well , I 'll leave that up to you , because that 's the real bottom line , is n't it , music lovers ? Do you like it enough and will you pay enough to keep the question of morality a hot topic on the Donahue show and out of the courts ? Those of you who listened to the simulcast over WBAI have probably already formulated an opinion . The rest of you will have to wait for the CD . <p> " I wo n't waste your time by talking about the technology . If you do n't understand it by now , after all the television specials and the ( ohmygodpleasenotanother ) in-depth discussions between your local blow-dried news creep and their pet science-fiction hack , you must not want to understand it . Nor am I going to wax profound and speculate on just how much of a man is left after re-animation . The only ones who know that are n't able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just does n't thrive on narcosis . Nor does any fraction of sensibility that cares to communicate itself . In fact , very little seems to thrive on narcosis aside from the desire ... no , like I said , the need to play music . <p> " And for reasons that God or someone only knows , the ability to play music where none existed before . <p> " That may be hard to swallow , I realize , but I 'm here to tell you , no matter how weird it sounds , it appears to be true . <p> " For the first time in memory , there was a curtain across the Vanguard 's stage . I suppose there 's some awkwardness involved in bringing the musicians out . Before the curtain was opened , William Dexter , the genius behind this whole deal , a little bald man with a hearing aid in each ear and the affable , simple face of someone who kids call by his first name , came out and said a few words about the need for drastic solutions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our goals and values . Things could not go on as they had been . The words seemed somewhat out of context , though they 're always nice to hear . Finally he introduced the quartet . As introductions go , this was a telegram . <p> " ' The music you 're about to hear , ' William Dexter said flatly , without the least hint of hype of hyperventilation , ' is going to the change your lives . ' <p> " And there they were . <p> " Right on the same stage where Coltrane turned a love supreme into song , where Miles singed us with the hateful beauty of needles and knives and Watts on fire , where Mingus went crazy in 7/4 time , where Ornette made Kansas City R &B; into the art of noise , and a thousand lesser geniuses dreamed and almost died and were changed before our eyes from men into moments so powerful that guys like me can make a living writing about them for people like you who just want to hear that what they felt when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one black , one Hispanic , the racial quota of an all-American TV show , marooned on a radiant island painted by a blue-white spot . All wearing sunglasses . <p> " Raybans , I think . <p> " Wonder if they 'll get a commercial . <p> " The piano player was young and skinny , just a kid , with the long brown hair of a rock star and sunglasses that held gleams as shiny and cold as the black surface of his Baldwin . The Hispanic guy on bass could n't have been more than eighteen , and the horn player , the black man , he was about twenty-five , the oldest . The drummer , a shadow with a crew cut and a pale brow , I could n't see him clearly but I could tell he was young , too . <p> " Too young , you 'd think , to have much to say . <p> " But then maybe time goes by more slowly and wisdom accretes with every measure ... in the afterlife . <p> " No apparent signal passed between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Goodrick reached for his tape recorder , thinking he should listen to the set again before getting into the music , but then he realized that another listen was unnecessary  --  he could still hear every blessed note . The ocean of dark chords on the piano opening over a snaky , slithering hiss of cymbals and a cluttered rumble plucked from the double bass , and then that sinuous alto line , like snake-charmer music rising out of a storm of thunderheads and scuttling claws , all fusing into a signature as plaintive and familiar and elusive as a muezzin 's call . Christ , it stuck with you like a jingle for Burger King ... though nothing about it was simple . It seemed to have the freedom of jazz , yet at the same time it had the feel of heavy , ritual music . <p> Weird shit . <p> And it sure as hell stuck with you . <p> He got up from the desk , grabbed his drink and walked over to the window . The nearby buildings ordered the black sky , ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellations , and linear rivers of light below , flowing along consecutive chasms through the high country of Manhattan . Usually the view soothed him and turned his thoughts to pleasureable agendas , as if height itself were a form of assurance , an emblematic potency that freed you from anxiety . But tonight he remained unaffected . The sky and the city seemed to have lost their scope and grandeur , to have become merely an adjunct to his living room . <p> He cast about the apartment , looking for the clock . Could n't locate it for a second among a chaos of sticks of gleaming chrome , shining black floors , framed prints , and the black plush coffins of the sofas . He 'd never put it together before , but the place looked like a cross between a Nautilus gym and a goddamn mortuary . Rachel 's taste could use a little modification . <p> Two-thirty a.m .... Damn ! <p> Where the hell was she ? <p> She usually gave him time alone after a show to write his column . Went and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Maybe she 'd found a special friend . Maybe that was the reason she had missed the show tonight . If that was the case , she 'd been with the bastard for ... what ? Almost seven hours now . Screwing her brains out in some midtown hotel . <p> Bitch ! He 'd settle her hash when she got home . <p> Whoa , big fella , he said to himself . Get real . Rachel would be much cooler than that ... make that , had been much cooler . Her affairs were state of the art , so quietly and elegantly handled that he had been able to perfect denial . This was n't her style . And even if she were to throw it in his face , he would n't do a thing to her . Oh , he 'd want to ; he 'd want to bash her goddamned head in . But he would just sit there and smile and buy her bullshit explanation . <p> Love , he guessed you 'd call it , the kind of love that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more accurate to call it pussywhipped . There were times he did n't think he could take it anymore , times  --  like now  --  when his head felt full of lightning , on the verge of exploding and setting everything around him on fire . But he always managed to contain his anger and swallow his pride , to grin and bear it , to settle for the specious currency of her lovemaking , the price she paid to live high and do what she wanted . <p> Jesus , he felt strange . Too many pops at the Vanguard , that was likely the problem . But maybe he was coming down with something . <p> He laughed . <p> Like maybe middle age ? Like the **49;79;TOOLONG flu ? <p> Still , he had felt better in his time . No real symptoms , just out of sorts , sluggish , dulled , some trouble concentrating . <p> Finish the column , he said to himself ; just finish the damn thing , take two aspirin , and fall out . Deal with Rachel in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring her breakfast in bed , ask how she was feeling , and what was she doing later ? <p> God , he loved her ! <p> Loves her not . Loves . Loves her not . <p> He tore off a last mental petal and tossed the stem away . Then he returned to the desk and typed a few lines about the music onto the Computer and sat considering the screen . After a moment he began to type again . <p> " Plenty of blind men have played the Vanguard , and plenty of men have played there who 've had other reasons to hide their eyes , working behind some miracle of modern chemistry that made them sensitive to light . I 've never wanted to see their eyes  --  the fact that they were hidden told me all I need to know about them . But tonight I wanted to see , I wanted to know what the quartet was seeing , what lay behind those sunglasses starred from the white spot . Shadows , it 's said . But what sort of shadows ? Shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , or do they see shadows where we see none ? I thought if I could look into their eyes , I 'd understand what caused the alto to sound like a reedy alarm being given against a crawl of background radiation , why one moment it conjured images of static red flashes amid black mountains moving , and the next brought to mind a livid blue streak pulsing in a serene darkness , a mineral moon in a granite sky . <p> " Despite the compelling quality of the music , I could n't set aside my curiosity and simply listen . What was I listening to , after all ? A clever parlor trick ? Sleight of hand on a metaphysical level ? Were these guys really playing Death 's Top Forty , or had Mr. William Dexter managed to chump the whole world and program four stiffs to make certain muscular reactions to subliminal stimuli ? " <p> The funny thing was , Goodrick thought , now he could n't stop listening to the damn music . In fact , certain phrases were becoming so insistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having difficulty thinking rationally . <p> He switched the radio on , wanting to hear something else , to get a perspective on the column . <p> No chance . <p> Afterlife was playing on the radio , too . <p> He was stunned , imagining some bizarre Twilight Zone circumstance , but then realized that the radio was tuned to WBAI . They must be replaying the simulcast . Pretty unusual for them to devote so much air to one story . Still , it was n't everyday the dead came back to life and played song stylings for your listening pleasure . <p> He recognized the passage . They must have just started the replay . Shit , the boys had n't even gotten warmed up yet . <p> Heh , heh . <p> He followed the serpentine track of the alto cutting across the rumble and clutter of the chords and fills behind it , a bright ribbon of sound etched through thunder and power and darkness . <p> A moment later he looked at the clock and was startled to discover that the moment had lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little spaced ; so what ? He was entitled , He 'd had a hard wife ... life . Wife . The knifing word he 'd wed , the dull flesh , the syrupy blood , the pouty breasts , the painted face he 'd thought was pretty . The dead music woman , the woman whose voice caused cancer , whose kisses left damp mildewed stains , whose .... <p> His heart beat flabbily , his hands were cramped , his fingertips were numb , and his thoughts were a whining , glowing crack opening in a smoky sky like slow lightning . Feeling a dark red emotion too contemplative to be anger , he typed a single paragraph and then stopped to read what he had written . <p> " The thing about this music is , it just feels right . It 's not art , it 's not beauty ; it 's a meter reading on the state of the soul , of the world . It 's the bottom line of all time , a registering of creepy fundamentals , the rendering into music of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a universal alpha wave , God 's EKG , the least possible music , the absolute minimum of sound , all that 's left to say , to be , for them , for us ... maybe that 's why it feels so damn right , It creates an option to suicide , a place where there is no great trouble . only a trickle of blood through stony flesh and the crackle of a base electric message across the brain . " <p> Well , he thought , now there 's a waste of a paragraph . Put that into the column , and he 'd be looking for work with a weekly shopping guide . <p> He essayed a laugh and produced a gulping noise . Damn , he felt lousy . <p> Not lousy , really , just ... just sort of nothing . Like there was nothing in his head except the music . Music and black dead air . Dead life . <p> Dead love . He typed a few more lines . <p> " Maybe Dexter was right , maybe this music will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed mine . I feel like shit , my lady 's out with some dirtball lowlife and all I can muster by way of a reaction is mild pique . I mean , maybe the effect of Afterlife 's music is to reduce the emotional volatility of our kind , to diminish us to the level of the stiffs who play it . That might explain Dexter 's peace-and-love rap . People who feel like I do would n't have the energy for war , for polluting , for much of anything . They 'd probably sit around most of the time , trying to think something , hoping for food to walk in the door .... " <p> Jesus , what if the music actually did buzz you like that ? Tripped some chemical switch and slowly shut you down , brain cell by brain cell , until you were about three degrees below normal and as lively as a hibernating bear . What if that were true , and right this second it was being broadcast all over hell on WBAI ? This is crazy , man , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if Dexter 's hearing aids had been ear plugs , what if the son of a bitch had n't listened to the music himself ? What if he knew how the music would affect the audience , what if he was after turning half of everybody into zombies all in the name of a better world ? And what would be so wrong with that ? <p> Not a thing . Cleaner air , less war , more food to go around ... just stack the dim bulbs in warehouses and let them vegetate , while everyone else cleaned up the mess . <p> Not a thing wrong with it ... as long as you were n't in the half that had listened to the music . <p> The light was beginning to hurt his eyes . He switched off the lamp and sat in the darkness , staring at the glowing screen . He glanced out the window . Since last he 'd looked , it appeared that about three-quarters of the lights in the adjoining buildings had been darkened , making it appear that the remaining lights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of golden squares against a black page . He had a crawly feeling along his spine , imagining thousands of other Manhattan nighthawks growing slow and cold and sensitive to light , sitting in their dark rooms , while a whining alto serpent stung them in the brain . <p> The idea was ludicrous  --  Dexter had just been shooting off his mouth , firing off more white liberal bullshit . Still , Goodrick did n't feel much like laughing . <p> Maybe , he thought , he should call the police ... call someone . <p> But then he 'd have to get up , dial the phone , talk , and it was so much more pleasant just to sit here and listen to the background static of the universe , to the sad song of a next-to-nothing life . <p> He remembered how peaceful After-life had been , the piano man 's pale hands flowing over the keys , like white animals gliding , making a rippling track , and the horn man 's eyes rolled up , showing all white under the sunglasses , turned inward toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurring on the strings , but his head fallen back , gaping , his eyes on the ceiling , as if keeping track of the stars . <p> This was really happening , he thought ; he believed it , yet he could n't rouse himself to panic . His hands flexed on the arms of the chair , and he swallowed , and he listened . More lights were switched off in the adjoining towers . This was really fucking happening ... and he was n't afraid . As a matter of fact , he was beginning to enjoy the feeling . Like a little vacation . Just turn down the volume and response , sit back and let the ol ' brain start to mellow like aging cheese . <p> Wonder what Rachel would say ? <p> Why , she 'd be delighted ! She had n't heard the music , after all , and she 'd be happy as a goddamn clam to be one of the quick , to have him sit there and fester while she brought over strangers and let them pork her on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any objection , right ? Maybe dead guys liked to watch . Maybe .... His hands started itching , smudged with city dirt . He decided that he had to wash them . <p> With a mighty effort , feeling like he weighed five hundred pounds , he heaved up to his feet and shuffled toward the bathroom . It took him what seemed a couple of minutes to reach it , to fumble for the wall switch and flick it on . The light almost blinded him , and he reeled back against the wall , shading his eyes . Glints and gleams shattering off porcelain , chrome fixtures , and tiles , a shrapnel of light blowing toward his retinas . " Aw , Jesus , " he said . " Jesus ! " Then he caught sight of himself in the mirror . Pasty skin , liverish , too-red lips , bruised-looking circles around his eyes . Mr. Zombie . <p> He managed to look away . <p> He turned on the faucet . Music ran out along with the bright water , and when he stuck his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water , just the gloomy notation spidering across his skin . <p> He jerked his hands back and stared at them , watched them dripping glittering bits of alto and drum , bass and piano . After a moment he switched off the light and stood in the cool , blessed dark , listening to the alto playing in the distance , luring his thoughts down and down into a golden crooked tunnel leading nowhere . <p> One thing he had to admit : Having your vitality turned down to the bottom notch gave you perspective on the whole vital world . Take Rachel , now . She 'd come in any minute , all bright and smiling , switching her ass , she 'd toss her purse and coat somewhere , give him a perky kiss , ask how the column was going ... and all the while her sexual engine would be cooling , ticking away the last degrees of heat like how a car engine ticks in the silence of a garage , some vile juice leaking from her . He could see it clearly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either helpless rage or frustration , but rather registering it as an untenable state of affairs . Something would have to be done . That was obvious . It was surprising he 'd never come to that conclusion before ... or maybe not so surprising . He 'd been too agitated , too emotional . Now ... now change was possible . He would have to talk to Rachel , to work things out differently . Actually , he thought , a talk would n't be necessary . Just a little listening experience , and she 'd get with the program . <p> He hated to leave the soothing darkness of the bathroom , but he felt he should finish the column ... just to tie up loose ends . He went back into the living room and sat in front of the computer . WBAI had finished replaying the simulcast He must have been in the john a long time . He switched off the radio so he could hear the music in his head . <p> " I 'm sitting here listening to a little night music , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death 's door , and you know , even though I ca n't hear or think of much of anything except that shivery sliver of sound , it 's become more a virtue than a hindrance ; it 's beginning to order the world in an entirely new way . I do n't have to explain it to those of you who are hearing it with me , but for the rest of you , let me shed some light on the experience . One sees ... clearly , I suppose , is the word , yet that does n't cover it . One is freed from the tangles of inhibition , volatile emotion , and thus can perceive how easy it is to change one 's life , and finally , one understands that with a very few changes one can achieve a state of calm perfection . A snip here , a tuck taken there , another snip-snip , and suddenly it becomes apparent that there is nothing left to do , absolutely nothing , and one has achieved utter harmony with one 's environment . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmed it . Even the darkness , he realized , had its own peculiar radiance . B-zarre . He drew a deep breath ... or rather tried to , but his chest did n't move . Cool , he thought , very cool . No moving parts . Just solid calm , white , white calm in a black , black , shell , and a little bit of fixing up remaining to do . He was almost there . Wherever there was . <p> A cool alto trickle of pleasure through the rumble of nights . <p> " I can not recommend the experience too highly . After all , there 's almost no overhead , no troublesome desires , no ugly moods , no loathsome habits .... " <p> A click  --  the front door opening , a sound that seemed to increase the brightness in the room . Footsteps , and then Rachel 's voice . <p> " Wade ? " <p> He could feel her . Hot , sticky , soft . He could feel the suety weights of her breasts , the torsion of her hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind , a lewd concerto of vitality and deceit . <p> " There you are ! " she said brightly , a streak of hot sound , and came up behind him . She leaned down , hands on his shoulders , and kissed his cheek , a serpent of brown hair coiling across his neck and onto his chest . <p> " How 's the column going ? " she asked , moving away . <p> He cut his eyes toward her . That teardrop ass sheathed in silk , that mind like a sewer running with black bile , that heart like a pound of red raw poisoned hamburger . Those cute little puppies bounding along in front . <p> The fevered temperature of her soiled flesh brightened everything . Even the air was shining . The shadows were black glares . <p> " Fine , " he said . " Almost finished . " <p> " ... only infinite slow minutes , slow thoughts like curls of smoke , only time , only a flicker of presence , only perfect music that does not exist like smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He chuckled . " Did n't you catch it on the radio ? " <p> A pause . " No , I was busy . " <p> Busy , uh-huh . Hips thrusting up from a rumpled sheet , sleek with sweat , mouth full of tongue , breasts rolling fatly , big ass flattening . <p> " It was good for me , " he said . <p> A nervous giggle . <p> " Very good , " he said . " The best . " <p> He examined his feelings . All in order , all under control ... what there was of them . A few splinters of despair , a fragment of anger , some shards of love . Not enough to matter , not enough to impair judgment . <p> " Are you okay ? You sound funny . " <p> " I 'm fine , " he said , feeling a creepy , secretive tingle of delight . " Want to hear the Vanguard set ? I taped it . " <p> " Sure ... but are n't you sleepy ? I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He switched on the recorder . The computer screen was blazing like a white sun . <p> " ... the crackling of a black storm , the red thread of a fire on a distant ridge , the whole world irradiated by a mystic vibration , the quickened inches of the flesh becoming cool and easy , the White Nile of the calmed mind flowing everywhere .... " <p> " Like it ? " he asked . She had walked over to the window and was standing facing it , gazing out at the city . <p> " It 's ... curious , " she said . " I do n't know if I like it , but it 's effective . " <p> Was that a hint of entranced dullness in her voice ? Or was it merely distraction ? Open those ears wide , baby , and let that ol ' black magic take over . <p> " ... just listen , just let it flow in , let it fill the empty spaces in your brain with muttering , cluttering bassy blunders and a crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and coil up inside your skull .... " <p> The column just could n't hold his interest . Who the hell was going to read it , anyway ? His place was with Rachel , helping her through the rough spots of the transition , the confusion , the unsettled feelings . With difficulty , he got to his feet and walked over to Rachel . Put his hands on her hips . She tensed , then relaxed against him . Then she tensed again . He looked out over the top of her head at Manhattan . Only a few lights showing . The message growing simpler and simpler . Dot , dot , dot . Stop . Dot , dot . Stop . <p> Stop . <p> " Can we talk , Wade ? " <p> " Listen to the music , baby . " <p> " No ... really . We have to talk ! " <p> She tried to pull away from him , but he held her , his fingers hooked on her hipbones . <p> " It 'll keep ' til morning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She turned to face him , fixed him with her intricate green eyes . " I 've been putting this off too long already . " Her mouth opened , as if she were going to speak , but then she looked away . " I 'm so sorry , " she said after a considerable pause . <p> He knew what was coming , and he did n't want to hear it . Could n't she just wait ? In a few minutes she 'd begin to understand , to know what he knew . Christ , could n't she wait ? <p> " Listen , " he said . " Okay ? Listen to the music and then we 'll talk . " <p> " God , Wade ! What is it with you and this dumb music ? " <p> She started to flounce off , but he caught her by the arm . <p> " If you give it a chance , you 'll see what l mean , " he said . " But it takes a while . You have to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " The music ... it 's really something . It does something . " <p> " Oh , God , Wade ! This is important ! " <p> She fought against his grip . <p> " I know , " he said , " I know it is . But just do this first . Do it for me . " <p> " All right , all right ! If it 'll make you happy . " She heaved a sigh , made a visible effort at focusing on the music , her head tipped to the side ... but only for a couple of seconds . <p> " I ca n't listen , " she said . " There 's too much on my mind . " <p> " You 're not trying . " <p> " Oh , Wade , " she said , her chin quivering , a catch in her voice . " I 've been trying , I really have . You do n't know . Please ! Let 's just sit down and .... " She let out another sigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He had to calm her , to let his calm generate and flow inside her . He put a hand on the back of her neck , forced her head down on his shoulder . She struggled , but he kept up a firm pressure . <p> " Let me go , damn it ! " she said , her voice muffled . " Let me go ! " Then , after a moment : " You 're smothering me . " <p> He let her lift her head . <p> " What 's wrong with you , Wade ? " <p> There was confusion and fright in her face , and he wanted to soothe her , to take away all her anxieties . <p> " Nothing 's wrong , " he said with the sedated piety of a priest . " I just want you to listen . Tomorrow morning .... " <p> " I do n't want to listen . Ca n't you understand that ? I do n't . Want . To listen . Now let me go . " <p> " I 'm doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you nuts ? Let me go ! " <p> " I ca n't , baby . l just ca n't . " <p> She tried to twist free again , but he refused to release her . <p> " All right , all right ! I was trying to avoid a scene , but if that 's how you want it ! " She tossed back her hair , glared at him defiantly . " I 'm leaving .... " <p> He could n't let her say it and spoil the evening ; he could n't let her disrupt the healing process . Without anger , without bitterness , but rather with the precision and control of someone trimming a hedge , he backhanded her , nailed her flush on the jaw with all his strength , snapping her head about . She went hard against the thick window glass , the back of her skull impacting with a sharp crack , and then she slumped to the floor , her head twisted at an improbable angle . <p> Snip , snip . <p> He stood waiting for grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wave of serenity as palpable as a stream of cool water , as a cool golden passage on a distant horn . <p> Snip . <p> The shape of his life was perfected . <p> Rachel 's too . <p> Lying there , pale lips parted , face rapt and slack , drained of lust and emotions , she was beautiful . A trickle of blood eeled from her hairline , and Goodrick realized that the pattern it made echoed the alto line exactly , that the music was leaking from her , signaling the minimal continuance of her life . She was n't dead ; she had merely suffered a necessary reduction . He sensed the edgy crackle of her thoughts , like the intermittent popping of a fire gone to embers . <p> " It 's okay , baby . It 's okay . " He put an arm under her back and lifted her , supporting her about the waist . Then he hauled her over to the sofa . He helped her to sit , and sat beside her , an arm about her shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breast pressed into his arm . He could hear the music coming from her , along with the electric wrack and tumble of her thoughts . They had never been closer than they were right now , he thought . <p> He wanted to say something , to tell her how much he loved her , but found that he could no longer speak , his throat muscles slack and useless . <p> Well , that was okay . <p> Rachel knew how he felt , anyway . <p> But if he could speak , he 'd tell her that he 'd always known they could work things out , that though they 'd had their problems , they were made for each other .... " <p> The light was growing incandescent , as if having your life ultimately simplified admitted you to a dimension of blazing whiteness . It was streaming up from everything , from the radio , the television , from Rachel 's parted lips , from every surface , whitening the air , the night , whiting out hope , truth , beauty , sadness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was swelling in volume , stifling thought , becoming a kind of thirsting presence inside him .

Might have known , he thought , there 'd be some fly in the ointment , that perfection did n't measure up to its rep . <p> He held onto Rachel tightly , whispering endearments , saying , " Baby , it 'll be okay in a minute , just lie back , just take it easy , " trying to reassure her , to help her through this part of things . He could tell the light was bothering her as well by the way she buried her face in the crook of his neck . <p> If this shit kept up , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both some sunglasses . <p>
