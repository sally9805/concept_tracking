Two weeks ago , the world 's media were flooded with bloody , unforgettable images from South Africa : two white , neo-Nazi militiamen  --  wounded in a gun battle with black troops in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana  --  were executed in front of a crowd of stunned photojournalists . What was it like to record this brutal scene ? Time 's Johannesburg bureau chief Scott MacLeod asked several of the photographers involved . <P> James Nachtwey , TIME : " I assumed the army would come up and arrest the ( ( militiamen ) ) and take them to the hospital . No one thought they were going to be killed . We thought they were safe because we were there , ( ( that ) ) they would n't shoot them with cameras around . It was totally unreasonable . " <P> Kevin Carter , Reuter : " I had my back to the scene , and a double shot rang out . Everyone headed for cover . I did the same . Straight after , I looked back and saw ( ( the soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot two frames off . ( ( Later ) ) everyone was ' well done-ing ' me . But I knew I had missed the shot . I made the mistake of running for cover instead of turning around , coldly analyzing the situation and shooting a great execution picture . . . Why did n't we help them ? I personally appealed to a policeman , ' Take your prisoners and lock them up . ' But some ( ( other ) ) poor policeman had just discovered one of the bodies that the ( ( neo-Nazis ) ) shot , a civilian . He was angry and just said , ' F  --  - it , ' and shot them . . . Inside , a voice is screaming ' My God ! ' But it is time to work . Deal with the rest later . " <P> Cobus Bodenstein , Johannesburg Sunday Times : " I took a few overalls of the whole scene . I was wondering what to do next . ( ( Then ) ) I heard a shot and saw a head jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( shooter ) ) turned on us , screaming in Tswana , pointing the rifle at us . Ten of his colleagues seemed to cock their rifles . So we ran away . I knew that lunacy was playing a big role . . . If any journalist , especially a white journalist , would have so much as touched those people , we would have died with them . I do n't believe I am the hand of God , just the eye . " <P> Gideon Mendel , Network Agency : " Photographers are aware that violence is a valuable commodity . When I heard that some photographers had been at ( ( the execution ; Mendel shot the aftermath ) ) , I said , ' F  --  - , I missed the event . ' That 's a rather peculiar thing for a human being to say . ' Damn , I was n't at the scene of a killing . ' I am disturbed at seeing hoards of photographers chasing after violence , although I am a part of it . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
