You 're in a tropical rain forest , trying to decide whether to explore the ruined Maya temple in the distance or climb into the forest canopy overhead , where you might see some monkeys . Suddenly there 's a yellow-brown jaguar sitting on the branch above you , flicking his tail from side to side , his yellow eyes fixed on yours . Maybe climbing a tree is n't such a good idea after all . You do n't think jaguars eat people , but rather than find out , you head off across the forest floor , turning this way and that , until you manage to get yourself hopelessly lost . <P> Do n't panic . Just hang up , take a deep breath , and log on again . You 're not going to Panama , after all , just to a machine somewhere in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . And what you are exploring is not an exotic ecosystem but a computer system called a MUD . <P> MUDs ( the name stands for Multi-User Dungeons ) are the latest twist in the already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor man 's virtual reality  --  created by using words , not expensive head-mounted displays  --  MUDs are a quantum leap over computer bulletin boards , where you not only meet and interact with other computer users from all over the world but build your own imaginary worlds as well . The first MUD was invented in 1979 as a way for British university students to play the fantasy game Dungeons &; Dragons by computer . But in the past few years computer scientists $ have created new kinds of MUDs that are far removed from the D &D; world . These quickly caught on among college students  --  and among the general computer- using population too . Suddenly new MUDs are sprouting up everywhere in cyberspace , in every size and shape . <P> Some MUDs are fashioned after medieval villages , with town squares , blacksmiths and churches . Others re-create science-fiction and fairy-tale settings , like C.S. Lewis ' Narnia , Frank Herbert 's Dune and the universe of Star Trek . Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers have built a MUD model of their famous Media Lab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One intrepid group of computer users constructed a section of the London Underground , complete with a virtual subway . MUDs come and go , drifting in and out of favor , but the current count is estimated at 300 worldwide , most of them accessible through the vast global computer grid called the Internet . <P> Playing in a MUD is like wandering through a literary maze . Scenes are sketched out in a phrase or two  --  a woody glade , a drafty cave  --  and you move from one to the other by typing commands : go west , climb up , enter castle . In your travels , you run into various objects ( a giggling robot , a sleeping sloth ) as well as other characters . These can be other players , logging on from a remote computer , or cleverly designed computer programs masquerading as humans . You can communicate with anyone you meet by either speaking ( typing a message that appears on the other player 's screen ) or " emoting " ( expressing a feeling or performing an action ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time stabbing , clubbing or otherwise inflicting pain on other players . In more highly evolved MUDs , characters engage in all manner of intimate communications , including simulated sex .
