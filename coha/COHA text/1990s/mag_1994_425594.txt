Follow the Money ? If you ca n't deal with someone 's arguments , you can always attack his motives . Mr. Sullum is NR 's articles editor . <p> I RECENTLY received a handwritten note in the mail . The message was simple : After reading your article ' Just How Bad Is Secondhand Smoke ? ' NR , May 16 and seeing the ad for Benson &; Hedges on the back of the magazine , it does n't take a rocket scientist to realize you and your kind have an agenda to push . ' <p> Rather than question the plausibility of this reader 's implicit accusation , let 's assume that it 's true : Philip Morris , NR , and I conspired to place my article in the same issue as a Benson &; Hedges ad . Furthermore , I wrote the article because I secretly work for Philip Morris . Would that affect the truth of what I wrote ? <p> I raise the question because this form of ad hominem attack is quite popular these days , especially ( but not exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accuracy in Reporting and publications such as The Nation are obsessed with following the money . ' When presented with conclusions they do n't like , their first instinct is to ask about the author : Who funds him ? ' Motives over Evidence <p> Allegations about financial ties often take the place of serious debate . Liberals criticize Christina Hoff Sommers , author of Who Stole Feminism ? , for taking money from conservative foundations , while conservatives criticize Ralph Nader for taking money from trial lawyers . For the lazy mind , such attacks are an excuse to avoid the effort of considering arguments and evidence . <p> It 's not surprising that this approach to controversy is common among newspaper reporters . In May , as part of a national advertising campaign , R. J. Reynolds reprinted an op-ed piece I had written for the Wall Street Journal outlining some of the problems with the Environmental Protection Agency 's report on the health effects of secondhand smoke . At the time I was managing editor of Reason magazine , published by the Reason Foundation in Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer for a Washington-based newspaper called the Daily Citizen . When I wrote the piece for the Journal , he asked , did I know that Philip Morris had given money to the Reason Foundation ? Should n't I have disclosed that fact ? <p> I asked him why , and he was not able to give me a coherent answer . But I got the drift of what he was suggesting : people should know about the donation so that they could assume I had been influenced by tobacco money and therefore discount what I had written . Well , I said , in 1993 Philip Morris gave Reason $10,000 , which represented less than 0.4 per cent of the foundation 's budget . It seems implausible that you could corrupt a think tank that cheaply . In any case , donations to the foundation had no impact on my pay or my job security . Furthermore , I had been taking the same positions on smoking policy for years . Not only that , but I disagreed with the tobacco companies on a number of issues , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights ' laws , and the wisdom of drug prohibition . <p> By this point , not surprisingly , I was starting to sound a bit defensive . I 'm not trying to question your integrity , ' the reporter said . Of course , that is exactly what he was trying to do . He wanted to undermine my credibility by suggesting a hidden motivation . But in his enthusiasm to reveal the conspiracy behind my op-ed piece , he missed an important point : my motivation was completely irrelevant . In latching onto the donation from Philip Morris , he was committing a logical fallacy : impugn a person 's motives , and you 've weakened his argument . <p> My encounter with the Daily Citizen was just a preview . In July , Philip Morris bought full-page ads in newspapers throughout the country to reprint an article I had written for Forbes MediaCritic about press coverage of the secondhand-smoke issue . I first heard about this ad campaign from an AP reporter , who called to ask me about it . The story he wrote was fair by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Morris 's donation was relevant in evaluating my work . <p> The AP story was followed by an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch headlined , Philip Morris aided periodical , ' which noted that , in addition to giving money to the Reason Foundation , Philip Morris had advertised in Reason . The reporter did quote my comment that people should be able to evaluate arguments and evidence on their merits . ' But again , the very reason for the story was to cast doubt on the credibility of my article . <p> Both of these reporters were fair-minded enough to call me and Reason for a response . Not so the Los Angeles Times , which summed up my arti-cle in a sentence and added : The criticism of the EPA 's science in the article , however , relied heavily on researchers who have received significant tobacco industry funds in the past , such as Alvan Feinstein , a Yale epidemiologist . ' <p> This is neither relevant nor surprising . Scientists who study smoking issues and have qualms about the case against secondhand smoke are unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards of secondhand smoke will encourage smokers to quit , an outcome they probably welcome . And they know that voicing their skepticism would expose them to intense criticism from their colleagues and could endanger funding from government agencies and anti-smoking groups . The few who do have the courage to speak up are apt to be sought out by tobacco companies as consultants and to attract research grants from them . If such funding is grounds for doubt , so is money from private organizations , such as the American Cancer Society , and government agencies , such as the California Department of Health , that are committed to achieving a smoke-free society . ' Further , ' the L.A. Times continued , both Philip Morris and its subsidiary , Kraft General Foods , were listed as ' major donors ' in the Foundation 's 1993 annual report . ' The money amounted to less than 1 per cent of the foundation 's budget , even if you count the advertising revenue . But the reporter clearly thought it should lead people to question my conclusions . <p> It turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 17 letter to the Wall Street Journal , Scott Ballin , chairman of the Coalition on Smoking or Health , took issue with an article about tobacco taxes by economists Gary Becker and Michael Grossman . Ballin considered it worth noting that Mr. Becker is a fellow at the Hoover Institution , and that Mr. Grossman is an associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research , both of which have received substantial funding from Philip Morris , America 's largest cigarette manufacturer . ' In Ballin 's universe , it seems , the Hoover Institution and the National Bureau of Economic Research are fronts for the tobacco industry , and two highly respected economists ( Becker won the Nobel Prize last year ) are a couple of Philip Morris flacks . The Money Trail <p> THIS SORT OF reasoning ( if it can be called that ) was endorsed by the majority staff of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment in a July 22 press release headlined The Tobacco Industry 's Misinformation Campaign . ' It mentions me once , in a paragraph that begins : Virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists with financial ties to the tobacco industry . ' ( Although I appreciate the honor , I am not a scientist , just a humble journalist . ) The press release dismisses me and my story in a sentence : At the time he wrote the article reprinted in the Philip Morris ads , Jacob Sullum was the managing editor of Reason Magazine , which receives major donations from Philip Morris and its subsidiary Kraft General Foods . ' ( The donations were neither major ' nor to the magazine , but never mind . ) <p> I called the subcommittee to find out why the authors of the press release had seen fit to include this information in a document that was ostensibly addressing criticism of the EPA report . I think it 's interesting to look at financial links , ' said Phil Barnett , counsel to the subcommittee . I asked him why . It goes to the point of whether . . . people have financial relationships . ' And why is this important ? I think it 's self-explanatory . It makes the point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . ' I assured him that it did n't , but no matter how I pressed him , he would not spell out the insinuation . He just kept repeating , I think it speaks for itself . ' <p> Neither the press accounts nor the subcommittee 's press release ( nor a longer press release from the EPA , which managed to discuss the Philip Morris ads without mentioning me ) actually dealt with the MediaCritic article . The piece has been out for months now , and no one has contacted me to question its accuracy , even though it criticizes several journalists by name . MediaCritic has not received any letters pointing out errors or challenging my criticism of the press coverage . So far as I know , the article has not been refuted in any important respect . Yet people are being invited to dismiss it as tobacco-industry propaganda . <p> The journalists and congressional staffers who take this tack surely would not want it adopted as a general rule . Henry Waxman ( D. , Calif. ) , chairman of the Subcommittee on Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineries and from organizations representing health-care providers , including the American Medical Association . Does that mean we should ignore anything he might have to say about alcohol or health care ? The Los Angeles Times runs ads for automobiles and packaged food ( even products made by Kraft , a subsidiary of Philip Morris ) . Should we therefore be suspicious of the paper 's reporting on those industries ? As Ballin noted , even supposedly independent scholars work for institutions that receive corporate donations . From this perspective , the only people you can really trust are funded by taxpayers , who have no choice in the matter . <p> Yet everyone has an agenda , financial or otherwise . Bureaucrats and researchers may be driven by ideology , by a hunger for power , publicity , or funding , or simply by the desire to reduce smoking and thereby improve the public health . ' If we have independent reasons to believe that someone is shading the truth , these agendas can help explain why . But the motivations themselves do not discredit the conclusions . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stop pretending that only one side in the debate about secondhand smoke has an axe to grind . Instead of taking intellectual shortcuts , they should start assessing the arguments on both sides . Are they valid ? Are they backed up by evidence ? What does the research show ? How was it conducted ? Do the data justify the conclusions drawn by the researchers ? This is the way that science and journalism  --  and any endeavor that aims at the truth  --  should proceed . <p> But what else do you expect me and my kind to say ? <p>
