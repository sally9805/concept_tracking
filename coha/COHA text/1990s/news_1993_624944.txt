<p> YOU might figure a Texas town named Bangs to be a horrible spot for wingshooting  --  the irony factor is just too strong to ignore . But you 'd be wrong . <p> Bangs , a little burg just west of Brownwood and darned near dead center of Texas , is deep in the heart of what well may be the best dove hunting country in the state . <p> Bangs , the rest of Brown County and four surrounding counties  --  Coleman , Mills , Comanche , and Hamilton  --  can make a killer case for being the dove hunting center of Texas . <p> All it takes to believe that is to spend a little time there . <p> And do n't do it opening day or opening week . Check it out a couple of weeks into the season after most dove fields in other parts of the Central and North zones have been blown out by hunting pressure . <p> All it took was one glance at the mourning doves trickling into the old wheat field a couple of miles outside Bangs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No loafers and not even any straight-line , Pickett 's Charge-style birds , here . But there were " " plenty " of doves 10 days into the season . <p> The birds came in singles , pairs and small groups , whipping low over the mesquite and oaks , then tumbling to earth where they pecked for waste grain or some of the seeds dropped by the volunteer sunflowers . <p> They rode a dry , stiff wind that caused them to dip and corkscrew when they tried to change direction or power down for a landing . And if the birds caught a glimpse of a shotgun-holding hunter crouched beside a pump jack or trying to hide in the shadow of a mesquite , well , they 'd " " really " go gonzo . <p> I 've missed some doves by an awful long ways , but none any farther than one this afternoon . It came burning over the mesquites , dropped low over the field and bored a straight path 20 yards off the deck . A fast swing should get it , I figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump jack , mounted the gun and tracked the bird  --  no problem . It saw me a split second before I pulled the trigger , and hit the rudders . When the gun fired , the barrel was pointed probably 30 feet from the bird . <p> The miss was n't a big blow other than to my quickly-deflating ego . This field was swarming with doves . Another opportunity would come along in a minute . <p> Later , after 12-dove limits were taken and we sat on the truck tailgate watching squads of doves exit the feeding area , David Davis talked about the quality of dove hunting his home turf produces . <p> " " Every year is good , but this season has been great for doves , " Davis , who outfits dove and quail hunting in the Brownwood region , said . " " We took 2,500 birds out of one field the first week  --  and that 's just " " one " field . We 've got " " lots " of doves around here . " <p> Davis is n't blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beau coup " resident mourners , and serves as a stopping point for migrants heading south from Midwest and northern nesting areas . <p> The reason : The Cross Timbers ecological area , in which these counties sit , has everything mourning doves are looking for . <p> " " This area is perfect for doves , " said Larry Holland , a Brownwood-based wildlife biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department . " " It 's a transition zone between the Rolling Plains and the Edwards Plateau . <p> " " North of here , there 's not a lot of habitat on the plains and south of here you get into the Hill Country and there 's not much farming of the small grains doves like . <p> " " But here , we 've got lots of habitat , soil types doves like and a lot of acreage in small grains , " he said . <p> While doves will nest on the ground , they prefer to build their flimsy nests in trees . The Cross Timbers ' plentiful stands of mesquite and oak provide plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Those resident birds and migrants pushed south from Oklahoma , Kansas , Nebraska and the Dakotas find plenty to eat . Doves feed almost exclusively on small seeds , and there 's a lot of that forage available . <p> Native plants  --  croton , ragweed , pigweed  --  produce a lot of dove food . And domestic grains  --  wheat , milo  --  account for a huge portion of the available dove fodder . But one plant , in both its wild and domesticated varieties  --  is the main dove attraction . <p> " " Sunflowers are a stable food for doves around here , and this year sunflowers seem to be the main attraction , " Holland said . <p> Sunflowers fields are to Central Texas doves what rice fields are to coastal prairie geese . Fields holding native or domestic sunflowers draw hungry mourning doves like magnets attract metal filings . <p> And those doves attract a lot of hunters to the region . Those hunters spend money . And that means they 're more than welcomed by area residents . <p> You know visiting wingshooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see " " Hunters Welcome " on hotel marquees , and that 's exactly what visitors spot when they drive the main drag through Brownwood . <p> The importance of visiting dove hunters also shows in Hamilton , a 3,000-resident town that throws an annual festival on opening weekend of dove season . <p> According to TPWD research , more than 70,000 hunter/days are spent pursuing doves in the five-county area each season . <p> Brown County , with a population of about 35,000 , sees about 25,000 hunter/days of dove hunting during the season , with almost all of those wingshooters showing up during September . <p> " " There 's no doubt it 's a boost to the economy , " Holland says . <p> It 's tough to put a dollar figure on what dove hunting brings to the area , said Colie Donaldson of the Brown County Chamber of Commerce . <p> " " But I can tell you the impact is tremendous , " he said . <p> " " The number of calls that come into this office asking for lease information or guides is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps growing , " Donaldson said . " " This year , three weeks before the start of the season we were having to book hunters into hotels 70 miles away in Abilene because that was the closest available room . " <p> The region sits in a good location for drawing hunters from the state 's metropolitan areas . Brownwood is a good ride from Houston  --  about 300 miles  --  but it 's within 150 miles of Dallas , Fort Worth , Waco , Austin and Abilene . <p> And when hunters get there , they can chose from a wide range of dove hunting options . Day hunts , where hunters pay a fee for one-time access to a field and provide their own gear ( shells , dogs , stools , drinks , etc. ) , can be had for $ 20-$ 40  --  David Davis , for example , charges a $ 25 day-hunt fee . <p> Some outfitters will offer season-long access to dove fields  --  guide Harry Wayne Cloud charges $ 100 for such a season pass to his leased fields around Comanche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that include lodging , meals , transportation to fields , even shotshells in some cases . <p> Barton Harris of Brownwood has for the past four years been offering such top-drawer dove packages for groups of hunters . <p> His operation Executive Hunts , Inc. , is a low-profile business catering exclusively to corporate-sponsored groups . Harris has seen the business of dove hunting grow over the past couple of decades . <p> " " There 's always been a lot of dove hunting around here , but years ago it was mostly friends and family  --  people who lived in the cities would come back to their home place or a friend 's place in the country to dove hunt , " Harris said . <p> " " That 's changed . We 're now looking at a generation of hunters with no ties to the land , and no access other than through leases or outfitters . " <p> The switch to fee-access has spawned a burst of hunting-related businesses in the area . And it 's had the adjunct effect of improving the dove habitat . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doves , now that they 've learned they can benefit economically from it , " biologist Holland said . <p> Harris concurs . Where landowners once depended upon nature 's whim to draw doves to their property , they now ( at the urging of leasers and outfitters ) disc fields in the autumn to encourage volunteer sunflower production . And it works . <p> This past Saturday after , dozens of Harris ' clients rimmed a huge sunflower field near Bangs . Doves  --  thousands of them  - -  poured over the sun-dried stalks , buzzing hunters before landing in the field to feed . <p> The action was as good as it gets , and any shooter who did n't bag a 12-dove limit could only blame his shotgunning ability for a light bird belt . It was as steady a stream of birds as on some of the Mexico whitewing hunts I 've experienced . <p> Bangs , indeed .
