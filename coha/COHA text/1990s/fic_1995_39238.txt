I know what you mean , Mrs. Rodriguez . After all , eight months ago I was certainly one of the very last people on the planet you would expect to see on " Oprah . " A 43-year-old math professor at NYU , I was n't exactly the typical talk-show guest  --  never having slept with anybody else 's spouse , ordered a hit on a cheerleader or ice-skater , or entertained visitors from planet R-9 . After 23 years of marriage I was still seriously in love with a woman who occasionally surprises me with chocolates and roses . I liked my job , called my folks every weekend , was fond of my in-laws , and nuts about  --  though often bewildered by  --  our teenage daughters Peggy and Betsy . Heck , until all this started I don ' t think Bridie or I had ever seen a TV talk show , which turns out to have been no great loss . But of course that was all before " happy thoughts . " <p> The first " incident , " as they referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture in my 9 o'clock calculus class . One minute I 'm working out a derivative on the board , and the next thing I know  --  pop !  --  I 'm in the midst of this huge Technicolor dream , soundtrack and all , riding my dad piggyback across the living-room floor . Turns out , it 's my third birthday , and Aunt Megan and Uncle George have come over from Jersey to celebrate it with us in that old garage apartment in the Bronx . Mom , who is just a few years older than my undergrads , picks me off dad 's back and gives me this great hug , and over her shoulder I see George grinning through the lens of his Brownie instamatic as Megan lights the candles on a gargantuan angel food cake , my favorite ! Pop ! <p> Back on earth the funniest thing was the look on my students ' faces . Even some of the sleepers in the back seemed like they 'd just seen Elvis . Of course when I realized that I 'd been staring out into space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning like a Cheshire , I could understand their confusion . Not the sort of behavior one expects in a calculus class . They probably thought I was reliving some favorite equations . So I made a few coughing sounds and let them go early . And to tell you the truth I did n't think much more about it , though I did give both the girls a big hug that night , and later in bed Bridie joked that I seemed particularly frisky . <p> It happened again about three weeks later , while Bridie and I were at the Weinbergs ' anniversary party . We were at the table with the Donatellos , and I had just stood up to ask Jenny to dance when  --  pop !  --  I 'm in bed in the house on Washington Street and I can hear my parents tucking Mary and Jeffrey in . It 's a Sunday evening in August and there is still some light in the sky . The door cracks open , light spilling across the Roy Rogers blanket , and my father whispers that there just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quiet buckaroo who wanted to have a bowl of ice cream and watch a little " Bonanza . " We slip down the stairs , load three bowls of cherry vanilla onto a TV tray , and join Mom in the living room . Tucked under a quilt , I fall asleep on Dad 's lap just as Hop Sing is serving the Cartwright boys a huge breakfast . Pop ! <p> Well , Jenny Donatello , who 's a psychiatric nurse down at Columbia Presbyterian , looked like she 'd seen a ghost . She had me seated at the table and was stroking my forehead , asking me how I felt , and if I knew where I was . Bridie looked a little concerned as well , but I think my smile took the edge off of it for everyone . This time I 'd only been out of it about a minute and a half  --  the band was still playing the same Gershwin tune  --  and I certainly seemed very happy to everyone . <p> So after taking my pulse and asking a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less  --  fine . On the way home I told Bridie about the first incident in the classroom , and about the terrifically good feelings that accompanied these sudden memories . And a little later that evening she , too , found something to smile about . <p> But the next day Bridie had a phone conversation with Jenny , who agreed to speak to an acquaintance at Presbyterian , which led to a call that evening from a neuropsychologist suggesting I might want to come down for an interview , and maybe a couple of tests . A very curious situation , she said , probably not dangerous , but it could n't hurt to check things out a bit . Indeed , if the episodes were as I had described them , it might prove to be something rather interesting . If it had n't been for the look in Bridie 's eyes and the fact that Jenny had gone to some effort in setting this up , I might have passed on the invite . Still , it could n't do any harm . But  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and cure it . <p> So the following Wednesday I spent two hours with Dr. Alicia Steinfel , answering a battery of questions about the two episodes and taking an EEG with all those lovely probes attached to my head . On Friday she called to say that although the tests had given me a clean bill of health , my " happy dreams , " as she called them , had definitely piqued her curiosity . With Bridie ' s encouragement I agreed to play guinea pig as Dr. Steinfel and her small team of researchers ran me through six hours of fresh tests and interviews , including an entire collection of Rorschachs by Jackson Pollack and two more EEGs . <p> When I told them on Monday that I had had another incident the night before , they got pretty excited , and Alicia asked if I might possibly take a few days off from work . It would be very helpful , she assured me , if they could observe one of the REHMs ( Random Escaped Happy Memories ) as it actually occurred . While they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. , they did n't have a clue ) , three of the researchers suggested that this could indeed represent some sort of significant breakthrough . Well , I did have a week off for spring break , and I admit my own curiosity was also a bit piqued , so I consented to spending five days in the hospital 's neuropsychology unit , sitting around reading novels and playing pinochle in one of their observation rooms . <p> For the first three days nothing happened , and I think their attention was beginning to drift a bit . But then just after 11:15 Thursday morning I had a doozy , and every chart and needle in the place went off the scales . I was out for 15 minutes , my sister Mary and I tucked into the front seat of the mother of all roller-coaster rides , ripping through the sunniest July afternoon since Creation itself . When I came out of it there were six of them glued to the observation window , their eyes bugged out and their mouths hung open like they 'd just spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravy train to a Nobel prize . <p> After that morning you would have needed a fleet of UPS trucks to keep up with all the traffic of incoming equipment and outgoing grant proposals . Alicia 's boss in the unit , Dr. Albert Boorstein , took over supervision of the research and things were soon going like gangbusters , or at least they would have if I had been just the teeniest bit more cooperative . Boorstein himself was dissatisfied that I would n't quit my teaching job and become a full-time research subject-associate , forcing him and his team to limit their encyclopedia of tests to weekends and evenings . <p> Still , he tried to be a good sport about it . After all , I was the only REHMs carrier on the planet . And even with this fly in the ointment things got moving pretty quickly . Two weeks after Boorstein took over I was the cover article in the New England Journal of Medicine , and REHMs were the hottest topic in neuropsychology . By April my case had been presented at the Mayo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Steinfel to address its annual conference , which meant Bridie and I got a great week at the Honolulu Hilton . She and I joked that that memory would probably pop up when we were in the nursing home . <p> It did n't take long before everybody started developing their pet theories for the REHMs , or " happy thoughts " as Regis and Kathy called them . ( I was calling them " popcorn memories " because they seemed to just pop up , bathing me in a sort of warm , buttery afterglow . The reporter from Time loved that and used it in the cover story . ) A researcher on the Human Genome project argued that there was a " guilt chromosome " on the human DNA ( significantly larger in Irish and Jewish populations , it turns out ) , and that this factor had " blocked " the formation of numerous happy memories in my childhood , particularly those that were truly joyous . Thus , these memories had escaped to the stratosphere of my ( recently discovered ) super-conscious , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious , setting off a slight popping sound as they crossed my ego boundaries . <p> Shirley Maclaine commented in Parade that I was simply channeling , recovering memories of past lives , but I really do n't think there was " Bonanza " or Six Flags in a past life . Then of course the National Enquirer reported that it was a complete scam , and that I was really Elvis and JFK 's love child . Betty Friedan thought it was just typical that a white , middle-class male should be getting all these " sweet flashes , " and Rush Limbaugh argued it was about time a real American got a break  --  or at least he did till he found out I 'd voted for McGovern back in ' 72 . <p> When the story broke in the popular press , things started to get seriously out of hand . Suddenly Bridie and I were inundated with thousands of letters and phone calls , requesting all sorts of appearances , advice , and pieces of our clothing ! At school Peggy and Betsy were quizzed about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Star and National Enquirer offered them cash for any stories about their bizarre home life . Registration for my calculus and trigonometry classes was glutted with folks hoping to catch a REHM , and half a dozen people went on talk shows claiming to have been long lost childhood friends or schoolmates , with two saying that I 'd stolen their childhood memories . <p> Boorstein wanted me to write the introduction to his book , REHMs : A Journal of Starbursts , Ted Koppel asked Alicia if they could film incident number 100 for " Nightline , " and somebody at ABC wanted to produce a new sitcom called " Recovering the Popcorn ! " But the one that finally pushed us over the edge was Connie Chung crashing my mother 's 67th birthday party just to ask what all these false memories were trying to cover up . Never mind that Mom had already received 137 applications for adoption . <p> At the hospital Boorstein , feeling increasing pressure to produce greater results for the grants , wanted more and more incidents . Outside the unit he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible REHM carriers , while in the hospital he began suggesting that perhaps the number or intensity of my episodes could be " enhanced " with some biofeedback or medications . Alicia fought him over that and was promptly transferred off the project , significantly lowering morale among the other researchers . <p> It was n't long after this that my REHMs started tapering off , and within a few weeks they had stopped completely . Boorstein was anxious , furious , and then suicidal , having to be hospitalized briefly in a private psychiatric unit upstate . Within three weeks the observation unit was shut down , and after just three more stories in People and the Star we had dropped off the charts and into oblivion , having had just over our allocated 15 minutes of fame . Two months after the last recorded REHM , I started the fall term without a single reporter or wacko in the classroom , Bridie does n't get any more mail or bothersome calls at her real-estate office , and Peggy and Betsy are doing fine in school as well . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I figured sooner or later someone else would get a REHM , so when I read your letter I was n't all that surprised . The details of your experience are different from mine , but similar enough to make me think you are dealing with the real thing . So let me offer you some thoughts . First , in time you will learn to control them . I 'm still having them on a regular basis , but only when I want them , and only as long as I want . Second , they do n't seem to do anybody else any major good , so you 're probably better off if you do n't let yourself become an attraction in a sideshow , but just go on with your life as it is . Oh , and third ? Well , as Bridie has told me to tell you , you might want to mention to your husband that his sex life may be improving just a little bit . Keep well , Mrs. Rodriguez . <p> Fiction by Patrick McCormick , columnist for U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
