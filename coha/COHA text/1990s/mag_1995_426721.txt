Watch the Policy Exclusions <p> The insurance industry has an old saying : " The best insurance is the kind that pays when you make a claim . " This has always been and will always be true , because insurance involves the tricky business of transferring risks . <p> If you have questions about an insurance policy you 're either thinking about buying or have already bought , do n't feel bad about not understanding everything that 's in the policy . The things are designed to be difficult . Insurance companies  --  even the best ones  --  would rather not pay claims . They try to structure things so that they make money even when they have to pay , but settlements eat into their profits . So , most companies try to create a corporate culture of stinginess . They promote claims managers with low settlement averages and actuaries who can structure premium schedules that squeeze that maximum coverage out of every insurance dollar . If you invest in an insurance company , these moves sound like good management . If you 've made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infuriating evasion of responsibility . <p> What consumers seldom understand is that insurance policies are contracts . Terms are negotiable ; therefore , courts strictly enforce terms to which policyholders have agreed  --  whether or not they ever knew they could have demanded better terms . <p> You might hesitate at the notion of negotiating your own coverage . Insurance agents have traditionally played that role in the insurance-buying process . In the past , most consumers went to an agent , discussed their needs and waited to hear a quote . Since the early 1980s , however , insurance has become a self-service market . A growing number of insurance companies market directly  --  through the mail , over the phone , and even via computer on-line systems . These companies usually take a modular approach to structuring policies : They begin with a few basic forms and adjust them to specific customers by means of exclusions that limit coverage and endorsements that either limit or expand it . <p> In the wake of these changes , consumers have to do more of their own analysis . They need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . This means that disputes between policyholders and insurance companies over what policies cover and do n't cover will become a regular feature of the insurance business . <p> This article considers a number of essential issues that control most disputes over insurance coverage . Most of these cases involve homeowners ' or auto policies  --  but the conclusions apply to all kinds of insurance . <p> Insurance companies have two ways of protecting themselves against having to pay too many big claims . They can raise the amount they charge in premiums and they can build a lot of exclusions into the policies they sell . In a competitive marketplace , raising premiums means losing market share . Insurance companies do n't like that . They usually find using exclusions and exclusionary language easier . That 's why the parts of any policy that deal with definitions and exclusions are the most mind-numbing aspects of a mind-numbing field . <p> When considering these complicated exclusions , keep a few basic points in mind : Insurance policies are contracts . An insurance company may fix the terms of its policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and it may insure against certain risks and exclude others . The 1988 federal appeals court decision Amick v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. stated : " The court sees no injustice in requiring the company to pay only those risks it insured , where , as here , the coverages are spelled out in clear and unambiguous language . Where the terms of insurance contracts are clear and unambiguous , they must be construed according to their plain meaning , like other contracts . " Any ambiguity or uncertainty as to the meaning of those words will usually be interpreted in the policyholder 's favor because the insurance company selects the words used in a policy . In his dissent from the 1994 California supreme court decision Weil v. Federal Kemper Insurance , Justice Stanley Mosk gave a good explanation for this rule : " In the insurance context only one of the parties to the contract  --  the insurance company or its agent  --  is likely to know that a policy term has a special or technical meaning in the insurance business , and to intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchaser of the policy  --  is usually a layperson who does not share that specialized knowledge or intent . " So , in most cases , ambiguity means coverage . An ambiguity can be created by silence . If a policy talks about a general kind of coverage and makes a few exclusions to that coverage , it ca n't try to expand those exclusions by implication . In other words , once the general terms of coverage are established , all relevant risks are covered unless the policy explicitly says they are n't . <p> A literal example of ambiguity created by silence  --  namely , a missing word  --  came up in a 1994 federal court case Sirius Insurance Co. v. Paul Collins . Sirius had issued a one-year policy to Collins covering his boat and its trailer . The policy included a " theft warranty " relating to periods of out-of-water storage that conditioned coverage upon certain precautions to be taken by the insured . The policy read : " While the insured boat is stored on a trailer it shall be : 1 ) Kept in locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Secured with a trailer ball lock while attached to a vehicle . " <p> In January 1992 , Collins parked his truck and the trailered boat , attached with a ball lock , on the circular driveway at the front of his parents ' home . The following day the truck , trailer , and boat were missing from the driveway . Sirius declined Collins ' claim on his boat policy , arguing that the theft warranty required him to lock the boat to his trailer and then store both in a locked fenced enclosure . Collins argued that the warranty was ambiguous and had to be construed against Sirius . The ambiguity was created because the lack of the conjunctive " and " or " or " left unclear whether he was required to comply with one or both of the precautions . The trial court agreed , ruling that the insurance contract was " poorly drafted " and " or " made more sense than " and . " ( An appeals court , however , disagreed  --  sending the parties into settlement talks . ) In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the language is susceptible to two different interpretations . In keeping with this principle , terms of exclusion are to be narrowly construed . As the court wrote in the Missouri case Meyer Jewelry Co. v. General Insurance Co. of America : " . . . an insurance policy being a contract designed to furnish protection will , if reasonably possible , be interpreted so as to accomplish that object and not to defeat it . . . provisions limiting or cutting down on the coverage of the policy , or avoiding liability , will be construed most strongly against the insurer . " The policy should be read as a layman would read it and not as it might be analyzed by an attorney or an insurance expert . As the Georgia court of appeals wrote in the 1987 decision Gulf Insurance Co. v. Mathis : " In construing an insurance contract the test is not what the insurer intended its words to mean , but rather what a reasonable person in the insured 's position would understand them to mean . " An insurance contract is interpreted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that undermines or contradicts another . A court ca n't view portions of the contract or policy in isolation . It has to interpret the policy as a whole , considering all relevant portions together , and giving each provision effect , without eliminating any clause as meaningless . <p> The 1993 Missouri case Delbert and Eula Shaffner v. Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. considered an issue of contract entirety . In April 1991 , a house owned by the Shaffners was destroyed by fire . The Shaffners had never lived in the house themselves ; they used it as a rental property . They had a fire insurance policy issued by Farmers , which declined to pay Shaffner 's claim arguing that the house was vacant when it burned and pointing to the paragraph in the policy 's " Standard Provisions " section that stated : " This Company shall not be liable for loss occurring . . . while a described building , whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant , is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty consecutive days . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to Raymond and Rhonda Weaver . The house needed some clean-up and repairs and the Weavers agreed to help Shaffner do the work . Throughout April , Shaffner and the Weavers were present at the house almost daily , cleaning up and making repairs . Farmer 's denial relied on the definition of " vacant " established in a previous Missouri case : " The term ' vacant ' means empty , without inanimate objects , deprived of contents . A thing is vacant when there is nothing in it . ' Vacant ' means abandoned and not used for any purpose . " <p> The court ruled that this definition  --  though appearing in a separate endorsement to the Farmers policy  --  should apply to the entire contract . It also ruled that because the definition included confusing language , it had to be made in the way most favorable to the Shaffners . It ordered Farmers to pay . <p> Failure to use clear , conspicuous , and plain language in a notification of reduction ( when an insurance company tries to reduce the coverage offered by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid Disputes <p> Relying on the court system should always be a last resort for you , as an insurance policyholder . Justice is rarely swift in the American legal system  --  and justice that is n't swift is n't cheap . Unless you 're very wealthy , your insurance company will be better positioned to litigate a dispute . <p> It 's better for you to explore all the possible claim scenarios up front , when you 're comparing policies . If you have a specific scenario or exposure in mind when you 're buying insurance , you need to check the language of your policy  --  including all its endorsements and amendments  --  to determine whether coverage is offered or excluded . <p> While this kind of examination may require some effort , the effort is necessary . Insurance companies write policies that offer protection on general terms , but claims are always made on specific terms . The two processes are in inherent conflict . The language of a policy has to include provisions for the broad coverage for the protection of the insured person , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company . Rather than making an impossible attempt to describe all possible factual scenarios that are either covered or excluded , the situations must be described in general language . <p> Insurance companies do n't hesitate to delay covering costs when they believe they have cause . And many companies will pore over their own policies , even ones that include industry-standard language , looking for reasons not to pay . The 1990 Missouri appeals court case Bobbie Walters v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. involved a classic case of such a coverage dispute . It also serves as a good example of how intricately insurance policy language is scrutinized , and how ambiguity favors policyholders . <p> In September 1986 , Stanley Walters was involved in an automobile accident near Modesto , California . Because the accident was work-related , Walters made a claim for and received workers ' compensation benefits under Missouri 's Workers ' Compensation Law , where his employer was based . Walters also sought recovery of medical expenses based upon " Coverage C " in his automobile insurance policy , which State Farm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will pay medical expenses for bodily injury sustained by : the first person named in the declarations ; his or her spouse ; and their relatives . These persons have to sustain the bodily injury : while they operate or occupy a vehicle covered under the liability section ; or through being struck as a pedestrian by a motor vehicle or trailer . There is no coverage . . . for medical expenses for bodily injury . . . to the extent workers ' compensation benefits are required to be payable . . . . " <p> Both sides asked the Missouri court for summary judgment in their favor . The trial court granted State Farm 's request to dismiss Walters ' claim . Walters appealed the ruling and raised several points on appeal . The most important : Because the " workers ' compensation exclusionary clause " in the auto policy was ambiguous , standard insurance law held it had to be construed strictly against State Farm and to provide for coverage for medical expenses . The case turned on this point . <p> Walters argued that exclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits and workers ' comp benefits were unenforceably vague . The appeals court decided that the provision requiring review was the language " to the extent workers ' compensation benefits are required to be payable . " The operative words were " required " and " payable . " The word " required " implied something mandatory . The word " payable . . . has been held to mean may , can or should be paid . " Either word , considered alone , was easily understood . However , considered together as part of the same phrase , the words were n't compatible . <p> " The phrase ' required to be payable ' is equivalent to stating that it is mandatory that an amount may be paid . This produces , at best , an indistinctness and an uncertainty of meaning and is , therefore , ambiguous , " the court concluded . It suggested that the policy should have read " required to be paid , " which would have meant that Coverage C of the auto insurance only covered medical expenses not otherwise covered by workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " payable , " not the word " paid . " As written , the terms of the exclusion were uncertain and indistinct  --  and any such confusion works against the insurance company in a dispute . The appeals court reversed the lower court 's ruling for State Farm and ordered a new verdict in favor of Walters . <p> Keep Your Coverage Broad . You protect your interests most aggressively by pressing companies to keep your coverage as broad as possible . You can accomplish this by knowing the common exclusions and restrictions companies use and by understanding how and why they use them . For example , here are some of the usual exclusions you should be wary of when buying personal insurance covering your home , rented dwelling , personal property or car : Business Losses . This includes parts of your house that you use officially for business , data or papers you 've taken from work , and computers , software , or other property that belong to your company . Losses Caused By Ordinance or Law . This means enforcement of any ordinance regulating construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if your house burns down and a city ordinance requires that it be replaced with a stronger structure , your policy might not cover this . Loss Caused By Earth Movement . This means earthquakes , land shock waves , and tremors related to a volcanic eruption . It also includes landslides , mud slides , sinkholes , and other rising or shifting . Other Common Exclusions . Losses caused by : wear and tear , natural marring , or deterioration ; smog , rust or other corrosion ; mold , wet or dry rot ; birds , vermin , rodents , or insects ; animals you own or keep . so common to homeowners and auto policies are exclusions for damage caused by : Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing , heating , air conditioning , or automatic fire protective sprinkler system or of a household appliance . Riots and civil commotion . Vandalism or malicious mischief . Faulty planning , zoning , development , surveying , siting , or design . Any loss caused intentionally by an insured person . Volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , or tremors . <p> The exclusions in a policy are n't generated from any sense of propriety or fairness . They are n't even generated ( at least not initially ) from any sense of legal theory . They come from actuarial studies that seek to shave away the number of claims paid under a particular policy to the point that it becomes profitable enough to meet the company 's needs  --  without becoming uncompetitively expensive . As a consumer , your best strategy for protecting yourself in these disputes is to know which exclusions and restrictive provisions to avoid in policies you 're considering buying . The law tends to work for you once you 've signed on to a policy , so insurance companies have to protect their interests  --  and some do so aggressively  --  up to that point . <p> By James Walsh <p> <p> Mr. Walsh is managing editor of Merritt Publishing .
