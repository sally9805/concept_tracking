Buoyed by Olympic gold and Dot Richardson 's toothy grin , softball , like women 's basketball and soccer , had a fling with fame in 1996 . The triumphs of U.S. female athletes at the Atlanta Games accelerated efforts to create women 's professional sports leagues , and by ' 97 two basketball leagues and a softball loop were up and running . Two years later one basketball league has folded , and the other is seeing a drop-off at the gate even while under the NBA 's umbrella . World Cup mania notwithstanding , women 's soccer has yet to prove it can hold fans ' interest for more than a few weeks . // The surprise has been pro softball . Using a grassroots strategy , the six-team Women 's Pro Softball League ( WPSL ) was launched two years ago by John and Sage Cowles of the Cowles media family , whose daughter , Jane , was a star leftfielder at Utah State in the late ' 70s . In an unusually accommodating business move , the WPSL has concentrated its effort mostly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services , is looking for a foothold . Columbus , Ga. ; Durham and Gastonia , N.C. ; and Hampton , Va. , have been the league 's backbone , drawing 1,000 fans on a good night . The WPSL has fared worse in cities that are , in the words of Tom Lindemuth , general manager of the regular-season champion Tampa Bay FireStix , " glutted with family entertainment alternatives . " Orlando was one such city , and after last season the Wahoos were moved to Akron ( and rechristened the Racers ) , a hotbed of high school softball , where attendance has surged . Tampa Bay is considering a move to nearby Plant City , where in July the WPSL All-Star Game drew 4,200 spectators despite heavy rain . // Pro softball has piqued the interest of a particularly fickle demographic : the 18-to-34-year-old male with a remote control . This year WPSL games , broadcast on ESPN2 , drew higher ratings than Arena Football and NHL games on the same network . And WPSL CEO John Carroll says that after the 2000 Sydney Games , U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely join the league , adding star power . // As in the WNBA , teams are owned by the league . Each WPSL franchise has 20 players and a $160,000 salary cap ; the players , most of them former college stars , are paid only during the 66-game , May-to-August season . The rest of the year they have other jobs , mostly as teachers or coaches . // WPSL players are contractually required to sign autographs after games and conduct youth clinics on off-days  --  not that they mind . " It 's the intangibles , like being a role model , that make being a pro so special , " says FireStix pitcher DeeDee Weiman-Garcia , mother of a three-year-old son and one of two 1996 U.S. Olympic alternates in the league . " Money has never had a thing to do with it . " // If only running a pro league were that simple . While the WPSL is still operating in the red , AT&amp;T recently re-upped as title sponsor for three more seasons , and the Cowles have n't backed off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national exposure by next year , I 'm sure they will be discouraged , " says Carroll . " But the fact that they continue to increase their investment shows that they are willing to see this through . "
