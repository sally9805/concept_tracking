TITLE : A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT <P> DIRECTOR : ROBERT REDFORD <P> WRITER : RICHARD FRIEDENBERG <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Norman Maclean 's evocative novella of amazing grace is captured with understated artistry . <P> " I AM HAUNTED BY WATERS , " Norman Maclean wrote at the end of A River Runs Through It , his memoir-novella about growing up in Montana in the early years of this century . The phrase is both appropriate and curious : appropriate because his little story ( 104 pages ) is mostly about standing in mountain streams with his brother Paul , fly-fishing for trout ; curious because Maclean 's prose is dry and laconic , nothing watery about it . It does not rush or eddy or  --  heaven forfend  --  gurgle . It runs steady and clear , and beneath its surface you sense the darting shadows of powerful emotions  --  big fish , as it were , which the writer shrewdly plays but never deigns to reel all the way in . The art for this old man , a college professor who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the writerly casting of his lines , not in the melodrama of the catch . <P> It is hard to think of any recent book that is a less likely candidate for screen adaptation . As it turns out , it is hard to remember a serious work that has been more faithfully or more entrancingly turned into a movie . Partly this is because the screenwriter , Richard Friedenberg , has gently expanded the original work , using family history gathered from the writer ( who died in 1990 ) and his children . He has added some colorful boyhood anecdotes and , most important , has developed the boys ' relationship with their father , a Presbyterian minister ( Tom Skerritt ) , as well as Norman Maclean 's courtship of his wife , Jessie ( Emily Lloyd ) , more fully than they are in the book . Partly it is because director Robert Redford has rigorously maintained the understated tone of a book that never plea-bargains , never asks outright for sympathy or understanding , yet ultimately , powerfully , elicits both . <P> River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . It is held together by a narration drawn from the book and related ( by Redford ) over sequences of an Edenic Montana 70 years ago . Norman ( Craig Sheffer ) is the dutiful son , a young man soberly grappling throughout the film with the question of how to find and lead a useful life . Paul ( Brad Pitt ) is the classic younger brother and minister 's son , a charming sower of wild oats . He works casually at a raffish trade , newspaper reporting . He drinks . He gambles . He womanizes carelessly . It is only on the river that he asserts his true strength as a guileful fisherman , a man who makes a hard-won skill look easy . Here ( and here alone ) he is clearly a better man than his father and his brother . But since , as Maclean says in the first sentence of his book , " there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing " in his family , this is no small matter .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
