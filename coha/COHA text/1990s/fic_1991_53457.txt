" Thou seest this man 's fall , thou seest not his wrastling . " <p> I WAS TWENTY when I followed away from my town a trapeze family , aerialists , a group of beautiful winged people : mother , father , son , and daughter . They were the Ishbels . Their flights and falls bewitched me ; my ambition was to join this family . I followed the circus away , and I did not even say good-bye to my mother who was ill and lay all the time in bed , now ; or to my father who was a silent , sad man , and why ? I felt I was stealing away , as if I were turned out for a crime I could not name but felt a secret guilt for ... this sense of belonging to dangerous and double things , being claimed by them . For in those perilous days there at home and in that town , it was , I saw later , the problem of learning how to use my sensibility , how to keep from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my senses . I was , I discovered , extraordinarily equipped for love , being endowed with those sensual properties that set men wild in some hunt . The French have a name for such a young man who can not stay still : cerveau brule . I had a fire in my brains . Alone around the place-my home , that seemed to be dying  --  I went about in my hot secrecy and my goading loneliness with my desire that made me speechless when it possessed me , as though it burned my tongue out of my mouth and seared my words away . I fell into fits of speechless trembling , and I did not know how to use it , my desire . I sensed that it was meant to set something in motion , some beautiful flight or fall , and to finally erect some permanent structure . I reit , in that vague way of youth , that it was to be turned to greater use than combustion of flesh ; that was not enough  --  there was a further use . Yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves out in sensation , and where the sensational was the celebrated and the glorified . I had to learn this , and that is the world whose style I ran away into , fell into , ' and was almost destroyed by before I made the choice . My desire , I felt vaguely , might , like a furnace , produce power to turn something to light or to heat , through some work . It was a natural desire , then , after the ways and works of nature . The style of my time , I found , was unnatural or supernatural or preternatural , against nature ; and I was an instrument of nature  --  can you already see my danger ? But what I had to do was to learn the evil uses of my desire , its destructive uses , and this I did in ways I can not tell you now ; it is not the time or place-we are not yet in that country . I wormed and kicked , strangling in the ashes of my most magnificent fires ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had depleted in the hot uses of my desire . Yet who of us has not done this ? It is time to tell . I lay with anybody , a whole race of imagined beautiful people , to heal a throbbing pain ; yet what was healed ? <p> I followed the circus and worked at menial jobs with it , for which I was not suited ; but I was waiting . In time I made known my ambition to be an aerialist , and in time the Ishbels made me an apprentice to their son , Pietro . Ishbel , the father and husband and Master , trained me every day . I began my training by sitting at various levels of height for gradually increasing lengths of time until , finally , I was at the very top of the tent , sitting there for an hour  --  this was to adapt me to the sense of being over the wide mass of humanity below that would watch and ultimately acclaim me , to condition me to the solitude of height , and to arrange me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sparkling waters and gleaming fires , a shape of crystal breath in cold light is the only way I can describe him , for , again , he was described the way an odor or a sight or sound is given shape by nose and eye and ear  --  beyond words . He was more gentle beast than human . Yet in his face , round as an Earth , was all humanity . Sometimes ! thought , during my apprenticeship , that it would be enough to work with him in an act of two , that we might together , abandoning the family , form a splendid act that would shake and turn the world in another direction ; but no , I 'd remember it was the family I wanted to join , to be in the air with . Sometimes as I sat at my new height I would be filled with fears , looking down upon the round-Earth face of Ishbel below , and the fear of falling chilled me . Then I would cry down , " Ishbel ! Ishbel ! I am falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If you fall , I fall ! " We had this kind of relationship . We worked within a secret rapport , undefinable , so ask no name for it ... and if you need a name , call it the arrangement of air . <p> The time came when I was ready to join the family . It was a soldout show that night , in San Francisco . In the family tent where we were quietly waiting for the trumpet to announce our appearance , I thought , suddenly , how I or any one of us could destroy the family , and in that moment I was appalled at the thought that I might be moved by some daemonic will to destroy the act of the family . After all , I was only an adopted member of this family ; our blood was different . Nothing could change that . But the trumpet sounded , and we sprang and danced out onto the ring . The act began . Ishbel , the splendid-bodied animal , stood in the center of the ring and flung each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : first his wife , Isabella , then his daughter , Marabella , then the son , Pietro , then me , the adopted one . I flew up like a bird , hearing , as I soared up , the words of Ishbel whispered to me , " Remember if you fall , I fall .... " Now we were all on our levels , and in one moment we were in our flights , rising higher and higher , in the glittering lights . Once , in my dizzying winnowings and dartings , as though I were , now , a fish in this smooth water of air , I slipped and fell some little distance into the arms of Ishbel ; but in a flash I was free of him , in control of myself again , as though strengthened by Ishbel 's touch , and the crowd below never noticed the slip . I saw the flecked nets below us like the foam of an ocean ; but already I saw that I was flying like a bird from the boughs of the family : I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb higher and higher ; and I perched , ultimately , like a stunning ornament at the very top . To make one 's beginning with very beautiful and rare people is dangerous ; but we were a dazzling success that first night , and I was saluted by the crowd at the end of the performance as the glory of the act , the very darling of the family . <p> So I had become , at once , the star of the family , and my renown spread worldwide overnight . It seemed that the Ishbel Family Act existed only to display me , and they were certainly the first to agree with the world that I was a marvel to behold . They named me Marvello . <p> We went from city to city and I was the Prince of each . But something began to happen in me : my life became disordered and I felt bent on some kind of destruction in the world outside the Ishbel Act . Something left over from the work of the act or something generated by the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night , after the performance , I would go into the cities we played in and hunt . Since my body was craved by hundreds of anonymous people in the audience , I was no stranger in the town . I gave it willingly to whoever wished it , if they were beautiful and if I wanted them . My only requirement was that we wanted each other . I found and knew all ways of love , and my lovers flocked after me and followed the show sometimes , from city to city . My body 's hungers were insatiable . My life seemed basic : the only thing in it , the very center of it , was the Ishbel Act ; and whatever I indulged in beyond the act seemed passionately related to it . Sensual love seemed to enhance my genius in the air and to so beautify my work that my achievement became more dazzling than ever . The Ishbel Act itself began to take on a sense of my own wild life and strived , as a whole , to become more daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once shone without me , or to have stolen their brilliance . I did not question the connection  --  the relation between air and ground  --  between what I created above and what I destroyed below . <p> But then a change began , as within me , within the world that loved and celebrated and watched me in my work . They began to say that I corrupted the young . Parents feared me and would not bring their sons and daughters to watch me perform . Sons and daughters came anyway , secretly , or in defiance of their parents . I became a kind of Cause . I influenced many to leave home and to begin a sensual life of their own , Some of them , who had the genius for it , found great success and achievement . Others , who had nothing more than a lust for imitating , were destroyed , on the ground . Had I misled these ? <p> I caused a kind of revolution among the young . They would come to me and say , " We need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towns forbade me to perform , committees drew up interdictions against me and citizens signed them , and sometimes there were armed authorities at the gates to the tent to keep out the young . But then I disturbed the older and the old , who were not invulnerable to me ; and so what was there to do ? Despite the laws and acts of prohibition , the proclamations against me , the riots outside the tent , I went on , smuggled into the ring so mysteriously that my marvelous act was enhanced by the very opposition that tried to destroy me ; they could not catch me . They could do nothing to restrain me once I was in the air and above them all ; there was no way to bring me down . Then they were so transformed and enchanted that they Could do nothing but watch , in the kind of sensual trance I caused in them . And so I dazzled them again ; and so my act became an act of exceeding danger . By this time the Ishbels were no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to consider my great and beautiful power . What was the machinery in me that roused such responses and turned so many hearts ? Was it for good or for evil ? I was not an evil man , I thought . If I were to raise up , suddenly , a Cross , or to hold out the Bleeding Heart as the images in churches do , as I perched , in that blinding moment of the apotheosis of my act when I lit  --  in a shimmering mist of light at the very peak of the tent , the very top of the world which I had created within the tent  --  the most delicate , sparkling world of glittering fires and ices , - how many would I turn to the Cross and how many would I lead ' to its cause of charity arid mercy and so change , in great part , the course of men who had seen me ? My own power , which seemed to come from somewhere beyond me and through me to others , baffled me , for it had love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hope and doom . But I would not quarrel with it or analyze it beyond the recognition of it . Yet the recognition Of it was my first step toward the very destruction of what I considered and recognized : I was at a dangerous crossing . Those who spoke to me or wrote to me or lay with me told me that at that apocalyptic moment of m act of which I have spoken , I resembled the shape of the instrument of love , and that this was the shape that was burned on their brains and became their memory of me when they were alone in their beds or walking in the streets , and it led them to the acts which I was accused of provoking in them . This astonished me , but I would not ponder it . I roused a generation of Burned Brains ; they left lovers and homes and friends , restless and seeking , and I came to know , now , that I was that dangerous leader of men who tread the edge of the abyss of hellfire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turn back . Knowing what I knew , ! could never forget my knowledge of my own powers ; and whatever door I opened to flee my fiery room where I stood , flaming among the flames , opened again onto the same burning room . I was the man who could not choose but who had to make the choice , every day , every night , between love and death , life and murder . I was against the style of my time . <p> They accused me of witchcraft . But I had thought I was only Searching for my own reality , regardless of the consequences , in a time when men could not find theirs . My enemies were countless and they , as I have told you , were out to bring me down , to destroy my power and my influence , ' my act . The tent , during my act ( the Ishbels now only stood on the ground beneath me like statues ) , became a battleground , a theater of war ; it became a secret stolen place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-hungry and the abused who were the victims of their Own human race ; a front for the cause-hunters who would try to misuse me and my power to their own ends . Each man and woman felt himself to be alone with:me , just the two of us , in a hidden tower of voluptuous , ness , and such a Wave of sensuality came over the world of the tent that it seemed tO burn ! with desire and longing . <p> But if my accusers and my enemies were inimical to my act , my de , fenders were killers . These would come to me as if they had made me and say , " We want to give you a prize " ; or " I am chairman of the Committee of Awards and Honors of this city . We have decided that if you change your act , a bit here , a bit there , then the audience will acclaim you and your enemies will accept you and the Committee will then be honored to award you the highest prize it offers . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And when I asked who was Benuto , the chairman informed me , " He has won great recognition for his act , inspired by you and obviously influenced by you , but he has been willing to make the slight change necessary to bring to it that wide acclaim and applause which you lose to your enemies . " So my act was being imitated all over the country , in nightclubs and carnivals . Imitators were brought or came to me  --  little dollyfaced performers who , disguised as Kewpies in their act , leapt through burning hoops and were never once singed ; and big-haunched , slow-lipped women from the South ; and those who talked a brilliant act . I could see that they had debased to success what I had found in my own nature by pretending that it rose out of theirs , too ; and a whole style of aerialism developed which was loathsome to me , for it was a betrayal and it was easy ; they would never fall  --  they did it with nets and mirrors . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe , facile imitation of myself ! They threatened extradition and exile if I should not . <p> But the most dangerous of all were those traitors who used me as their scapegoat , those without the courage to admit the power of my act openly and so pretended to make a choice against it and to condemn it while , secretly , they joined me and craved me and wanted to imitate me . For these saw that I was acting out their own secret desires and delivered to me the punishment which they felt would come to them if they made real , as I had , their own hidden reality . These were the killers who cried out that they were on the side of life and I on death 's side , and they tried to murder me . <p> The great controversy began . One side said , " It is up to Marvello to disturb us , to speak for us " ; the other said , " He is evil and misbegotten , and he shames us with his own obsessions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my tent , my work , into chaos and strife below . More and more ! saw that my work in air , where I was removed and following the will of my own vision , solitary and in my innocent trance , was the only order I knew , and that I must make that choice : to stay with the work I was committed to and created for-to continue to bring the chaos and the strife and the betrayal on the ground to what order and what beauty and what simplicity ! could in the air . Could my observers not see that every night I performed my act I was brought to the very verge of destruction , and that I saved myself , miraculously , whole and rescued , at that last perilous moment ? They who had taught me what I had done could not see what they had taught reel But I was now fully informed of myself , ready to die for this work ; let them hang me , or burn me as infidel or traitor or witch  --  it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn from it all , to inform it of error , to redeem it to meaning , and this through love . Now I was squarely confronting myself and my moral problem , for that was what it was . I went on , in my act , solitary and as myself , in my own style , and did not listen to the others . <p> But it was Pietro , my brother in the act , who was determined to destroy me . Reduced , as it were , to ground and confined there by me who excelled him above in air , he envied and hated me . As I did my work above him I would occasionally catch the look of hatred in his face below and tremble . One night , at the climax of my act when every muscle and every nerve and sense in me was beating at the very edge of bursting in that final second of ecstasy which I knew in the act , there rose up to me from below a far-off bellowing cry that resounded in the great tent : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstasy which is like a dying , the name was an ancient name delivering me Par back to my beginning . " CAIN ! " it sounded once more , and all the evil of humanity was upon me like one blow . I lost my sense of myself and fell into the crowd . <p> Cries of " Marvello has fallen ! Marvello has fallen ! " echoed in my head as I fell , it seemed , through all the ages . How many were wounded by my fall and how many fatally I never knew ; the figures changed so often as the reports came of the disaster , but many men and women were crippled by my fall . Where before a dazzling silverand-blue bird had been my insignia , worn by my believers and admirers and converts on their hats or clothing , a crutch replaced it , upon which all the wounded walked . After my fall and the wounding of so many , a slow , wretched , and haunted army of cripples left the city where I fell and disappeared into the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a look came into my face which has never left it , together with the look which was put into me by ... whom ? by my race ? by the flagpole sitter in that other country , who , it seemed now , I had betrayed and destroyed ? by Pietro ? That mark lives there , in my face , as you can see , together with the other sign , half-and-half . But I had been named , and as I lay healing during those long long months of regeneration of the bone , in a place , a sanctuary which I will later tell about , for that is in another country , I faced the name in myself and I came to know and to understand its meaning . <p> The night of the fall  --  among all the wailing , writhing victims in the darkness of the . tent , in that terrible lightless night of destruction and tumult as if it were the clashing and the pandemonium of damned souls after . the deluge or the fire , for a fire , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , survivors in rags were tearing at their hair and clutching onto the debris Of demolished scaffolds , pulling themselves up , lovers were parted and called for one another and , finally , the whole flaming tent collapsed upon the agony of that tormented and suffering humanity . I crawled , like an animal , dragging my shattered limb behind me , out into the fields , through the fields and into the deep ditch alongside the high : way . I lay there all night , hearing the cries and screams and moans of the wounded and the terrified , hearing over and over again the cursing cry Of " CAIN ! CAIN ! " in my ears , saw the blazing tent , my splendid ruined world , billow and fall into burning rags , heard the explosions around it , the piercing squalls of the beasts of the menagerie-alas , I had destroyed the whole living world , it seemed , and even the helpless animals  --  and ! watched , like flaming Lucifer who fell to Earth , a torch to destroy it , the wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litters and in ambulances or on the shoulders of rescuers . In my hallucinated agony I saw them carrying my magnificent master , Ishbel , away and it was then that I saw that he was the image of the flagpole sitter . I had not rescued and redeemed him at all  --  I had destroyed him . I wanted to die in my extreme agony and I tasted on my swollen tongue the green bile of death . I died in the ditch , as only the living can . My night passed ... but into one long unrelieved darkness . . <p> The next day , around noon , I dragged onto the highway and , taken as one of the wounded  --  limping along the road in. the company of my , victims , because my face was so changed , the destroyer among the destroyed , unnoticed  --  I vanished . Where I went , I can not tell ; but I knew I had to heal myself , and that was my burden . I vanished ; no One knew where I was , ' nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there was the evil change over it , the look of Cain . I went up and down the world . I went to great cities . ' t dragged my crooked leg down the streets . I hid away . No one will ever know my agony , in rooms . <p> Near one of the rooms I lived in  --  on a street of the afflicted : cripples , the blind , those suffering the misery and degradation of bodily beauty-was a hall where the crippled met for recreation . I peered through the window on the street , a ragged and haunted outcast , and felt my guilt again when I watched the cripples shambling through a square dance in their grotesque and mocking movements , and I felt I had crippled them . At the top of the window through which I looked , when I looked up , with tears on my fiendish face , I saw a painted sign which said , " The way back is back to work . " And at that moment one of the twisted dancers in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor as though his legs had been cursed by me and I had reminded him of his infirmity which he was slowly and patiently strengthening , in great faith ; and the dance stopped . But the music , now a lingering ghostly tune of fiddlers , . went on , and all the dancers turned and glared at my face in the window as if I were Satan . At that moment the music seemed the unearthly cater , waul of the lost souls of the damned , and it seemed that I had appeared to destroy this hopeful company struggling to recuperate themselves . I had no way back ; I had no work except that which would only destroy again ; and now even the look of my face would destroy . I turned and hobbled away , down the long cold cavern of the city street , among the blind , sweeping their way with sticks , tapping on the concrete , between the haunted buildings and through the knifeblades of winter wind that slashed at my flesh , leaving the dancers fallen and kicking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to . If only I had had a friend to go to . But how could I dare to take a friend , I was so full of the fear that I would only wound him who would come close to me . They had convinced me , who so professed to love and desire and need me , that I was a dangerous man , a criminal , a killer , a destroyer . If love could do such damage , I thought , then what could hate do ? If I could find someone to hate , I suddenly thought , that might change everything . <p> In the cities where I went , to my horror , I saw little children in the streets and playgrounds imitating my act . Its foul influence lingered in the world , even in the memory and mimicry of children , as though I were some ancient mythic evil or an infamous desperado become a hero of bad children . I have corrupted the whole living world , I thought , and huddled and shambled away . In another city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devil , and when the Bride and Groom ran suddenly upon me in the street they withdrew in dread and then , joined by their wedding guests , fell upon me and beat me when I could not run . If I went into churches , the very crucifix seemed to be the shape of the Ishbel Family Act and mocked me , skull and bones at the foot of it . I crept , bent , in horror out of the churches . And I asked myself again , who had killed Marvello  --  what had brought him down ? What had caused his fall ? <p> I made money in ways too horrible to speak of . At night I committed animal acts upon whatever victim would take me , in the pitch dark ; and on Sundays I sat by the door of a church and begged with my half-look of love . My face had gone that once had been so beautiful on posters for all to see . I had the feeling it had , like those twofaced cards , been turned over to its other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ? What did these others , who passed me on the sidewalks and peered at me from windows , know or have that I did not ? Where was I so wrong , so outcast by being simply what I was , and they seemingly so right ? I thought , if I am that name that destroyed me-who called it up to me ? - then I will murder , after the work of the bearer of that name . I murdered , in the way purity can be corrupted , to remind men of Cain . <p> Once , as I scraped against a body pressed to a dark wall in an alleyway of a great city , rubbing against the other body as if I were to rub off all the evil and guilt of me onto it , I looked  --  with my swimming eye of animal ecstasy just at the moment when I might lose , for one flash of sensual oblivion , all my soul 's sorrow , upon the dark and scabby wall where I had my lover pinned-into the face of one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an ancestor . The eyes were ogled upwards in sensual joy just as mine were at that moment of looking , and the face was scarred as if clawed by the nails of a wild beast ; and over the wild , umbrageous and defiled face were written the half-effaced letters of a name : Marvello . It was my face , on an advertisement of my lost and destroyed act . In that second of my wailing joy-grief I found myself again , and it was as if I were again in the climax of my act at the top of the tent . I cried " Marvello ! " and then I crumpled down at the feet of my despised and blessed lover . My lover , stunned and terrified , fled down the dark alleyway and abandoned me there , alone with my dishonored image on the wall . <p> But I continued my criminal life . What I began with strangers in tenderness  --  at which they marveled as they loved me , in sighs and fierce embraces and whispered praises and protestations-ended in what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in violence : I crippled them . For invariably strangers would want to know who I was , who could love so passionately and give so much of myself to strangers . Some of them said , " You will die by love " ; others said I had invited them to murder me in love . " Who are you ? " they would ask , with flushed and trembling faces of overwhelming passion . Then when I could not tell them , for who was I , they turned on me . Or even if I told them who I was , I was telling a lie , for I myself did not know who I was ; and if a union began with someone based upon what I declared myself to be , for I was so vaunted because of my superb animalism  --  and this led me to begin to make impetuous declarations-then in time the union crumbled under violence because I was not what I said , or thought , I was . " Save reel save me ! " I began to cry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I meant was " name reel " I , again , was their sensuality 's scapegoat , which they at once fought and drew to them but would not admit in the daylight . They wanted to keep me as the evil part of themselves , denying my existence within them but using me , as if they were using themselves in a dark closet . This was their murder , for they were my killers : this is how I found my murderers . Who crippled whom , then ? " Bring me alive ! Come alive with me ! Let us name each other , honestly and without guilt ! " I would cry . " Let us be wild together , anything , but surrender with me . I can not live death  --  and when I die , like this , as you see me , dying , it is not even death ; that is the evil of it : it is not even death . " But they would not know what I meant ; they would not understand and only said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a race , hunting my murderer . I knew I had to be brought to life , to my reality again through love , if I could find the one who would die with me and bring a resurrection , a rising to life : one who would admit and face the Cain in me and in all others and with me seek our common brotherhood . I loved through all that race of dead and killing lovers , murderers . I had known the beautiful things we human beings can do to one another . But I had not found my Marvello , and so what Self I had to give to others was a lost Self , an avenging Self ; and who would join me , lost himself , to find that , together ? Cain  --  that name  --  is the lost part of us all . I tell you we must heal the Cain in us , and we must do it together . This is what I had to learn . Someone to be true with ! I cried out to myself . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

Together we would make a new beginning , a new world . <p> So I had , again , and by my nature , begun to attract to me another race of half-livers and half-lovers , and this time , again , I was one of them , stronger now , more lost than ever , turned upon myself , striking out at myself to try to destroy myself . I was in a relationship with those half-people who swarm and cluster round a desirable object off which they can suckle and who are more murderous than the criminal . I invited them and turned them upon themselves , and they turned myself upon me , in the very fields of love . But slowly , now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter exile , where I might live and move in that innocence , lost to me , and in that undisturbed connection with the living air-world , through which alone anything that lives can thrive and find its own growth , where my two half-faces might have a conversation and unite to make a whole face . Where were the undisguised ? Where was anyone who had the strength and the courage to show himself as he was ? The only hope , the only salvation , I knew now , was to find everything in my own self-where I had found so much evil and damageto make : that choice and to keep it , and to find it at my beginnings . But that was a crooked way home , where I was going . <p> If I could recapture the heroic feelings I had when so long ago I saw the figure on the flagpole and had my heroic dream of him , I might . be the man I had thought to be ! But I lost it , that feeling of the idea ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an idea where the blood had run out ' of it and love had died in it . How to put love back into it ? Considering.how I look at human experience  --  my own experience , when I discover my sews way of seeing what happens  --  am I doomed to ruin a magnificent vision because I live up too high over it , climbing up there to look at it because from where I look there is that slanting angle of my view , which I seem cursed by and which conflicts with what is seen from other points and levels ? What will be the fortune of my image , its progress through use in the world and through my constant examination of it , if it employs me to its ends , if I lose control of the image , if it hallucinates me ? <p> If one could again have a marvelous dream , or create one , and within that find something of value to go by , keeping it alive , and making it real and substantial in the walking world ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not seem to be going in the same direction ' .

So many others have made up a world and through that regenerated an afflicted world , and have done it alone in their own artifice . Out of their fantastic notion came a third world , removed from the fantastic creator and the world he sat or walked in as he created it , yet born out of the haft-murderous relationship of two lovers . For both had to begin with love ; and an expression of both , an object , a living third , speaking for both but removed , dear and permanent , resulted  --  to which they and others could refer what happened in their conflict with each other , and which would clarify it : an idea of flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence to understanding . <p> This is my choice .... <p> - London <p> <p> By WILLIAM GOYEN <p>
