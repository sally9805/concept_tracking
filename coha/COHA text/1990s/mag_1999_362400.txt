To listen to the hyperventilating that followed George W. Bush 's maiden campaign speech on education the other day in Los Angeles , you 'd think the Texas Governor had proposed something radical . " Dangerous , " declared Education Secretary Richard Riley . " Risky , " cried Sandra Feldman , president of the American Federation of Teachers . Al Gore seemed downright mad : " Bush wants to slam the door " on public schools , the Veep said , with a " back-door voucher plan . " <P> Jeepers . All Bush said was that in a program that amounts to 2% of overall K-12 spending , some schools serving poor kids might , if three years of state tests show they really stink and are n't improving , see their federal ( and some state ) cash given instead to parents in $1,500 chunks to use as they see fit . Forget whether the idea is sound or not : the one sure thing is , it 's so modest that it wo n't accomplish much of anything . <P> That such small beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools debate has become . Still , if Bush 's plan is largely symbolic , it 's also sensible , offering coherent baby steps to lift the skills of America 's neediest kids . Take his plan for Head Start , the popular preschool program that serves 850,000 disadvantaged children . While the 35-year-old program was meant to close the achievement gap between poor and middle-class toddlers , researchers agree it has brought no lasting gains . Most say that 's because Head Start has become more of a day-care service stressing health and nutrition , not literacy , as well as a jobs program for local mothers . It is true that kids ca n't learn unless they 're healthy and well fed ; but with no curriculum and loads of shoddy teachers , Head Start is n't living up to its potential . <P> Last year Congress nudged the program in the right direction , but the steps were meek : four-year-olds who know 10 letters of the alphabet , for example , are felt to be on track . Bush would require lessons that stress prereading and math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it is done well . If existing centers do n't deliver , Bush would sensibly make them compete with others for their federal contract . <P> Bush 's more controversial plan involves " Title I , " which sends $8 billion yearly to schools with poor kids . These grants can amount to $150,000 for a typical 500-child school ; they 've usually been used for teacher 's aides or special remedial classes , without great results . Reformers in both parties say the idea of holding schools accountable for progress is overdue . The prospect of being penalized by having the federal money rerouted directly to parents " gets the attention of educators and the bureaucracy , " says Ray Cortines , a Democrat and former schools chief in New York City and San Francisco . If states feel pressured to avoid such embarrassment , Bush 's plan could jump-start reforms at troubled schools . And while the left loathes the idea of vouchers , some experts think Bush 's notion that dollars should follow poor kids could be the first step toward better targeting Title I cash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools in more affluent districts .
