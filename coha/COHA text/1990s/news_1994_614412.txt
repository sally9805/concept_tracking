<p> " Reach out and touch someone " has taken on a new meaning as more people " talk " by fax , computer and e-mail . We asked Personal Technology readers how and why they keep in touch with family and friends via technology . <p> Here 's what they had to say : <p> I love communicating via e-mail . It is much quicker than " snail mail " and cheaper than long distance ! Unfortunately , my mother lives in a small town with no local access number for Prodigy . Otherwise , we would send e-mail several times a week . I do keep in touch with a friend of hers in Columbus , and after Santa brings Prodigy to my nephews in New Jersey , our families will keep in touch via e-mail . - Bonnie B. Boyle , Atlanta <p> I talk to my girlfriend at college through the Internet and by e- mail , mainly because it 's less costly . - Daniel D. Wesloskie , Atlanta <p> Occasionally I keep in touch with business acquaintances by fax and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in the state of Georgia reaches thousands . It is much less expensive to communicate with relatives and friends in France and California by fax instead of talking on the phone - you can say a lot more in a lot less time ! Darlene Coquerel , Lawrenceville <p> I use my PC and modem to communicate in order to cut back on the amount of paper products that I use . I also avoid those long lines in the post office trying to buy stamps . And soon the cost of a first-class stamp will be 32 cents . With all the letters that I have to write for either my personal use or for the small business that I own and operate , e-mail is a much better way to get my ideas , opinions and point across . - Kevin C. Hayes , Atlanta <p> After using various e-mail packages , I 've settled on Prodigy simply because it 's fairly ubiquitous , and users tend to log on often . Why ? Because I can say precisely what I want to , and at 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We find it very useful to communicate by computer and fax with our family members around the country . The fax makes it very easy to share information in a quick way whether they are home or not and is faster than leaving a voice message , thus saving long-distance charges . Besides , it 's fun to find a nice fax waiting for you when you get home . But faxes and computers ca n't take the place of truly personal communication between friends and family ; they only add a new face to the communication process . - W. Theodore Etzel III , Roswell <p> Three family members are tied via modem - one local , the others in other states . It means more contact than we would enjoy by telephone or any other method . - William J. Pruett Jr. , Atlanta <p> I communicate with my brother in Austria via e-mail . It is cheaper , easier and more reliable than the postal service . - Paul Nielsen , Stone Mountain <p> I communicate by fax and e-mail if I ca n't get ahold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pagers , answering machines and the phone , both hard wire and cellular . - Michael H. Poisson , Atlanta <p> I communicate with friends and lovers via e-mail . It 's a great way to talk to someone at my own convenience . It 's also quite a bit less costly than Ma Bell . - Sherri L. Sharpe , Macon <p> I respond to many personals ads on line . I communicate with the office via e-mail and do considerable faxing in my business . - Michael A. Jones , Mableton <p> I have a brother living outside Houston . I send him e-mail over the Internet to save on long-distance phone calls . I also use my computer to fax company news to my dad working in downtown Atlanta . - Michael A. Drake , Marietta <p> Being able to sit and think about what I want to say rather than talk spontaneously enables me to convey my opinions more thoroughly . I talk to a lot of people on bulletin boards in other states and do not have to pay a long-distance charge . Technology such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James M. De Long , Lawrenceville <p> My modem 's primary purpose is telecommuting . I work for a worldwide airline telecom company . I also live 40 miles from my job as a network programmer . Calls come in nights and weekends to solve problems . Last year I had to drive in if a problem could not be fixed over the phone . <p> Now I have the time to go home , help the kids with homework and continue leftover work from home if there was something left unfinished . From home , I have access to all files and programs as if I was sitting in the office . Also the mail feature of Access Atlanta allows message exchange between friends and relatives . - Stan J. Gay , Villa Rica <p> Yes . I have a couple of cousins in the Tennessee area that I have developed a closer relationship with by using Prodigy e-mail and faxes with the fax/modem . It started as a hobby and developed from there . - T. Joel Foster , Martinez <p> I communicate with family in Virginia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . It 's easy , fast and inexpensive - last month we exchanged over 80 messages for less than $ 1.50 ! - Gregory A. Trollope , Atlanta <p> I do communicate with friends and family via the computer interactive services and Internet . I have cerebral palsy . I am often at home , and with the exception of my husband , I have little access to safe , accessible transportation . It has definitely proven to be more affordable than the telephone ! I find that with each passing day , my computer has become my link to the world around me ! Thank you ! - Lisa A. Knapp , West Palm Beach , Fla . <p> Yes - via 14,400-baud modem/fax - because we transfer files/programs mainly ( Friends &; Family ) . - Johnny W. Duncan , Atlanta <p> Since 1989 , I have been in the state Legislature . The advent of new information technology has allowed me to keep close and accurate communication with my home and office while I am in Atlanta . Another legislator and I went in together on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can receive regular messages from my office and lists of constituents who have called or left comments or requests . <p> With e-mail and the Internet , this year I hope to be in even closer contact with my district in the legislative session , and with the new legislative info network , my constituents can keep a closer eye on their government ! - McCracken Poston , Ringgold <p> Found long lost brother . - John Schoppman , Canton <p> A flashing mail envelope gives me a warm , fuzzy feeling . We have family in the Midwest and children away at school with whom we trade e- mail . Most of it trivial , but the message is always LOVE . - Ruth L. Roth , Atlanta <p> Yes . . . constantly . . . I communicate via e-mail and chat lines with friends all over the country . When my daughter goes away to college next year , we plan to communicate daily through e-mail . It probably will be . . . " Dear mom . . . send money ! " - Karin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in the military reserve and am often away from home a good deal .
