Television Programs that are preaching racial and religious hatred are being broadcast in 24 of the 100 largest U.S. TV markets , appearing on the public access channels of cable systems . The technical quality of the programs ranges from slick , professionally produced videos to simple one-on-one interviews . All preach bigotry against members of minority groups , and a few go so far as to advocate violence . There are no reliable figures as to the number of viewers reached by these programs , but the cable networks on which they appear have access to millions of homes . Even if only a small percentage of these cable subscribers watch them , that amounts to a potential audience of tens if not hundreds of thousands , giving this vehicle for the dissemination of bigotry entree to a vast segment of the public . Among the major markets in which hate programs have been available to the public in recent months are San Diego , Los Angeles , Minneapolis , Seattle , Chicago , Tampa , New Haven , Pittsburgh , Phoenix , Atlanta , Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total number of programs preaching bigotry in these and smaller markets is 57 . The producer of the greatest number of hate programs is Tom Metzger , who leads White Aryan Resistance ( WAR ) , a California-based extremist organization . His shows appear under the title " Race and Reason . " Other TV programs that promote bigotry are " Airlink , " " Crusade for Christ and Country , " " The Other Israel , " " Our Israelite Origin , " and " The Joe Goyim Show . " In addition , Louis Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam and the Institute for Historical Review , a group that denies that the Nazi Holocaust occurred , provide videotapes for showing on public access channels . The appearance of these TV programs is made possible by the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 , which requires that the time be made available free of charge to the sponsor and states that " ... a cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any public , educational , or governmental use of channel capacity .... " An attempt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shut down a cable company 's public access channel because it was going to carry a Ku Klux Klan program proved unsuccessful . The effort was dropped when the Klan , represented by the American Civil Liberties Union , filed a lawsuit claiming the Council 's action violated the First Amendment . Concluding they could not win in the courts , city officials abandoned their effort . A COMMON PURPOSE The contents vary considerably , but share the common purpose of arousing hatred of members of minority groups : blacks , Jews , Hispanics , Asians , and homosexuals . The Nation of Islam programs also preach hostility toward whites . " RACE AND REASON , " appearing on 31 public access channels , generally features Metzger interviewing spokesmen of various extremist groups . His guests have included members of the Ku Klux Klan , neo-Nazis , racist skinheads , and assorted other bigots . In addition to interviews , " Race and Reason " has presented videos of skinhead festivals featuring them shouting " sieg heil " while giving the Nazi stiff-arm salute . Metzger has claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests on the program , conceived in 1983 and named " Race and Reason " to honor Carlton Putnam , a racist author who wrote a book by that title . There appear to be no limits to the racial invective spewed on the program . One skinhead guest exclaimed in regard to black prisoners : " We can start gassing all these niggers and get rid of them because there 's no need to keep paying taxes on their worthless lives . " Two of the extremists interviewed by Metzger on " Race and Reason , " Frank Silva and Karl Hand , currently are serving long jail terms . Silva was sentenced to 40 years in Federal prison for crimes committed as a member of the terrorist gang , The Order , which was responsible for the murder of Denver radio personality Alan Berg , several bombings , and a string of armed robberies . Hand appeared as the leader of the Louisiana-based Nationalist Socialist Liberation Front . Subsequent to videotaping his interview , he was convicted of attempted murder and is serving a 10-year sentence at the Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler " a great man " and described the founder of the American Nazi Party , George Lincoln Rockwell , as " our inspiration . " When Metzger asked Hand if he was against abortion , he replied : " It depends on who is being aborted . I 'm not concerned about blacks being aborted ; I 'm not concerned about any minorities being aborted . But the problem is , which I feel is a terrible thing , is that the majority of abortions are white , and so therefore you 're talking about another program genocide . " Then , evoking the centuries-old blood libel against the Jews , Hand declared : " Most of these abortions are being carried out by Jews as a form of ritual murder , I believe . " Skinheads spout some of the most extreme bigotry on " Race and Reason . " Discussing the skinhead scene in San Francisco , one said : " Basically , there 's a lot of faggots , a lot of prey game around here that need to be cleansed .... They 're an abomination .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with blacks , Jews , Hispanics , and Asians , are frequent targets of Metzger 's guests . In another exchange , Metzger asked the skinhead about their treatment by the press : " I 've seen in some of those magazines they call you Nazis all the time . And you 're terrible racists and all that .... What do you say to that ? " The skinhead raised his arm in a stiff-arm salute and replied gleefully : " Sieg heil to that ! " Metzger threw back his head and laughed . Metzger is a 52-year-old television repairman from Fallbrook , Calif . He is a former Grand Dragon of the California Ku Klux Klan who preaches racism and anti-Semitism combined with a leftish-sounding revolutionary ideology he labels the " Third Position . " In 1980 , Metzger won the Democratic nomination for Congress in the San Diego area , but was disavowed by the party organization . In the election , he lost overwhelmingly to the Republican incumbent . He since has repudiated electoral activity as a means of achieving his goals . In recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its members would bring new life and energy to organized racism . His rhetoric encourages skinheads to engage in violence under the standard excuse of " self-defense . " His monthly publication , WAR , regularly glorifies perpetrators of violence ( the imprisoned members of the terrorist gang known as The Order are " our highest living heroes " ) and vilifies minorities ( " Congoids , " " Brown Rot , " and " Mud People " ) . Jews especially are singled out for venomous treatment . Even the Pope has not been exempt ; WAR has characterized him as a " White Race Traitor . " In October , 1990 , Metzger , his son John , and his organization WAR successfully were sued in Portland , Ore. , by the family of an Ethiopian immigrant , Mulugeta Seraw , who had been beaten fatally by three skinheads . The Metzgers were charged with having incited the skinheads to commit the crime . The jury ordered them to pay the victim 's family $12,500,000 . The plaintiffs were represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail for cross-burning . Two spinoffs of Metzger 's program have appeared in some markets . Also called " Race and Reason , " these shows are produced by Herbert Poinsett , a Florida-based associate of Metzger , and Matt Hale , a Bradley University student who is the head of the East Peoria , Ill. - based American White Supremacist Party . " The Other Israel " is an hour-long video shown on four cable networks . Its producer and sponsor is Ted Pike , who has waged a vicious campaign of anti-Semitism in the name of Christianity . " The Other Israel , " produced in 1987 , is a slick , professional film that uses a good deal of artwork and footage from various legitimate sources . Although purportedly about the State of Israel , the film actually assaults the Jewish people and their history and religion . For example , Pike makes the absurd charge in the film that the Talmud condones adultery , " seduction of unwed adolescent girls , " and intercourse with children . " Modern Israel , " he alleges , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world from Christ and give it to the Anti-christ , Israel 's false Messiah , who will rule the world from Jerusalem . " There also is an Arabic-language version of " The Other Israel , " which has been shown over several public access channels . Pike , a 1971 graduate of Portland University , is best known for his anti-Semitic book , Israel : Our Duty ... Our Dilemma . His propaganda materials are distributed by the Oregon-based National Prayer Network headed by his father , Claude Pike , an anti-Jewish radio preacher and former local elder of the Evangelical United Brethren , a predecessor body of the United Methodist Church . Ted Pike 's audiotapes , books , and videos  --  all anti-Jewish  --  have been distributed widely to evangelical churches around the country . Many of his materials are advertised and promoted in The Spotlight , a publication of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby . " Airlink " is a video series produced by Richard Barrett , leader of the Nationalist Movement , a Mississippi-based white supremacist organization . The series , described by Barrett as " nationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shown over public access channels . Among the subjects covered are neo-Nazism , the Confederate flag , immigration , the Martin Luther King holiday , and the skinhead movement . Like Metzger 's " Race and Reason , " " Airlink " often features racist extremists in an interview format . One of Barrett 's regular guests is Roy Frankhauser , an influential member of the Invisible Empire , Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , and long a fixture on the far right . Frankhauser 's associations over the past 30 years have included the American Nazi Party , the National States Rights Party , the United Klans of America , the Minutemen , Liberty Lobby , the Lyndon LaRouche organization , and now the Invisible Empire . In October , 1986 , he was one of 10 key LaRouche associates indicted on Federal fraud and conspiracy charges involving a scheme that raised more than $1,000,000 through falsified credit card billings . He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison and fined $50,000 for conspiring to obstruct an investigation . Frankhauser 's appearance on " Airlink " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1986 , he filled in as a guest interviewer on " Race and Reason . " He also hosted a series of taped " Race and Reason " programs in Pennsylvania . An " Airlink " segment entitled " Skinheads " clearly demonstrates the raw hatred for which these young bigots are well-known . A skinhead interviewed on the program read from a recruitment flier urging white students to make their school a " minority-free zone . " To viewers , he issued this threat : " If you are watching , communists , faggots , watch out . We 're strong , we 're growing , we 're on the move , and we 're gon na win the battle . " Other " Airlink " episodes feature skinheads Michael Palasch , who heads the New Orleans-based National White Resistance , and Case Colcord , leader of the Arizona Hammer Skins . On Jan. 15 , 1990 , Colcord , dressed in a Nazi uniform , led skinheads parading down Phoenix 's Central Avenue in a march timed to coincide with Martin Luther King 's birthday . An " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview as " anti-Kingism . " Palasch , who once was convicted of battery of a racially mixed couple in Tampa , was one of the skinheads who provoked a melee on the set of the " Geraldo " show in November , 1988 , during which host Geraldo Rivera 's nose was broken . Barrett was born in 1943 and grew up in New York . He attended Rutgers University , obtained a law degree from Memphis State University , and presently lives and practices law in Mississippi . Barrett has run for public office in Mississippi several times , without success . He is the author of a 435-page autobiography entitled The Commission , in which he advocates resettlement of American minorities to Puerto Rico , Mexico , Israel , the Orient , and Africa . He also favors sterilization and abortions of " the unfit . " Barrett was active as an attorney with the Forsyth County Defense League , the group that defended the KKK and racist activists who used violence against black civil rights marchers protesting segregation in that Georgia county in January , 1987 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the March 14 , 1987 , rally of the Defense League . In the summer of 1988 , Barrett was co-leader of a demonstration of racists at the Democratic convention at Atlanta . The march was cancelled by the police department when violence from counter-demonstrators threatened to get out of hand . In December , 1988 , he held a " Warrior Weekend " for skinheads in Mississippi with the intention of training them in paramilitary activity . However , no more than a few youngsters attended , and the training turned out to be in the use of .22-caliber weapons . The Jackson Clarion-Ledger reported at the time that the target used for rifle practice at the Warrior Weekend was a picture of Martin Luther King , Jr . THE NATION OF ISLAM Under the leadership of Louis Farrakhan , the Nation of Islam is one of the promoters of bigotry over public access television . Its materials , telecast over seven stations , consists of videotapes of speeches made by Farrakhan at mass meetings in cities across the country . His major themes of black empowerment and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrakhan founded his Nation of Islam in the late 1970s , reaffirming the doctrines of the first Black Muslim leader , Elijah Muhammad , including the notion that whites are " devils " and that blacks are God 's chosen people . Farrakhan gained large audiences for his fiery preaching following his involvement in the 1984 presidential campaign of Jesse Jackson . Anti-Semitism long has been an important strand in his black nationalist doctrine . Addressing an audience in Los Angeles in 1985 , he characterized Judaism as a " dirty religion " and Israel as a " wicked hypocrisy . " Broadcasting over Chicago radio station WBEE in 1984 , he stated : " Here come sic the Jews do n't like Farrakhan , so they call me Hitler . Well , that 's a good name . Hitler was a very great man . What have I done ? Who have I killed ? I warn you , be careful , be careful . You 're putting yourself in dangerous , dangerous shoes . You have been the killer of the prophets . Now , if you seek my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than your fathers . " Speaking at Madison Square Garden in 1985 , Farrakhan said : " The Jews talk about " Never again ' ' .... Listen , Jews , this little black boy is your last chance because the Scriptures charge you with killing the prophets of God .... You can not say , " Never again " to God , because when he puts you in the oven , " Never again " do n't mean a thing . " These and similar Farrakhan statements continue to be videotaped and broadcast on public access television . Ironically , among those who have found Farrakhan 's bigotry worthy of support is Tom Metzger , who announced at a gathering of hate group activists in October , 1985 , that members of his organization had attended the Muslim leader 's Los Angeles Coliseum speech the previous month and made a contribution to the Nation of Islam . " They are the black counterpart of us , " he asserted . THE INSTITUTE FOR HISTORICAL REVIEW . Videotapes of the sessions of the 1990 annual conference of the Institute for Historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access channel . The IHR , since its inception in 1979 , has spearheaded the movement to deny the reality of the Holocaust . Its annual conferences serve as a platform for " revisionist historians " to present papers denying the facts of Nazi genocide . It is these presentations , captured on videotape , that the IHR attempts to place on public access TV . At the October , 1990 , IHR conference in Washington , D.C. , British revisionist historian David Irving 's remarks were preceded by a glowing introduction that quoted from a speech he gave in the German city of Dresden in February , 1990 : " Ladies and gentlemen , survivors and descendants of the holocaust of Dresden , the holocaust of Germans in Dresden really happened . That of the Jews in the gas chambers of Auschwitz is an invention . I am ashamed to be an Englishman . " Following the introduction , Irving launched into his address , entitled " Battleship Auschwitz " : " We have been subjected to the biggest propaganda offensive that the human race has ever known , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such financial clout , that we have not been able to recognize it as a propaganda offensive from start to finish . The biggest weapon , of course , of all in this propaganda campaign against the truth since 1945 has been the great battleship Auschwitz , and we have now at last ... the revisionist historical profession , have found as our own task , the major task , sink the Auschwitz . " The Institute for Historical Review was founded by Willis Carto , the anti-Semitic leader of Liberty Lobby . It is only one of several front organizations and publications operated by him . Another is Noontide Press , which distributes an array of anti-Jewish and pro-Nazi materials , including the notorious fabrication , " The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion . " The IHR promotes a number of books sympathetic to the Nazi regime in Germany . Typical of the works it distributes is The Auschwitz Myth : A Judge Looks at the Evidence , by Wilhelm Staeglich . " Crusade for Christ and Country " is the name assigned by Gordon " Jack " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exploding the " Chosen People " Myth " and " Fingerprints of Israel 's Identity " on public access television . Both are aimed at denying that today 's Jews are the authentic descendants of biblical Israel . This theme , characteristic of the pseudo-theology known as " Identity , " invariably is accompanied by raw anti-Semitism . An example of Mohr 's attitude toward Jews is this statement which appeared in a Ku Klux Klan publication in 1988 : " Many nations have expelled the Jews . Is the whole world wrong ? Why have the Jews been driven from nearly every country in the world ? " His answer : " Once a people realize the Jew is a non-productive money changing parasite , the Jew is expelled . " Another typical Mohr theme  --  this one expressed at the 1987 conference of the Kingdom Christian Fellowship  --  claims " there is a false Israel in the world today ... those that say they are Jews and are not , but are of the synagogue of Satan . " Jack Mohr is a retired U.S. Army colonel who heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense " group restricted to white Christians . The organization closely is associated with the Christian Patriots Defense League , an Illinois-based anti-Semitic survivalist group that has been involved in paramilitary activity and martial arts training . Mohr operates out of his home base in Bay St. Louis , Miss . MISCELLANEOUS HATE PROGRAMS . Several public access channels have received and played videotapes based on hate themes from local unaffiliated individuals . In Richmond , Va. , for example , an anti-black and anti-Jewish presentation , " The Joe Goyim Show , " has been submitted by Matt Elmore , who produces it and plays the title character . In St. Paul , Minn. , an anti-Semitic video , " Our Israelite Origin , " has appeared on public access . St. Paul public access also has received and repeatedly played public announcements of the Ku Klux Klan , the Minnesota White Man 's Association , and a gang of racist skinheads . In each case , viewers were invited to send for further information about the organization . COUNTERACTION How are communities to respond when a bigot takes advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public access channel ? What steps can the cable company take when faced with the prospect of having to show one of these programs ? As noted previously , there are explicit limitations within the Cable Act of 1984 on restrictions and editorial control of public access programming . Yet , there are ways of mitigating the impact of extremist television without contravening the First Amendment . * When a bigoted TV show has been scheduled to appear or already has appeared on public access , citizens have responded with programming of their own . Community groups have produced or acquired films , videotaped interviews with experts on extremism or victims of hate crimes , or conducted live televised public discussions with local citizens . This " marketplace of ideas " approach is based on the proposition that the best response to " bad " speech is " good " speech . Cable systems usually have welcomed these efforts and , in some cases , have notified community organizations and encouraged them to offer a response when cablecast extremist programming has arisen . * " Local origin " addresses two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used effectively  --  local production requirements and local sponsorship requirements . Many cable systems restrict public access to programs produced locally , often in the station 's own studio . While a large number of systems always have applied this rule , some that previously did not subsequently chose to institute it . There has been no legal bar to their doing so . One downside to the local production requirement is that it limits access by legitimate national organizations that would like to submit material for broadcast in response to a locally produced bigoted program . Most cable systems require that public access material be submitted by a local individual or organization . While this procedure does not preclude outside programs from being shown , it obliges an extremist like Tom Metzger to enlist the help of a locally based follower to get his show on cable . Frequently , there are no local extremists motivated enough to fill out the application and bring the videotapes to the studio week after week . In other cases , a series will cease to air when the local sponsor either moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current . Some cable systems require that the name of the local producer or sponsor of public access programs be shown on the television screen before and after screening . In the case of extremist programs , this may discourage would-be sponsors . * In a procedure that long has been used on radio , some cable systems employ disclaimers preceding and following the airing of an objectionable presentation . The Cable Act prohibits the exercise of editorial control over programs aired on public access , but a disclaimer disassociating the system from the content of a show does not constitute censorship . * The Cable Act of 1984 specifically restricts editorial control of public access programming . It is important to note , however , that it does not require a cable system to install and operate a public access channel . That decision usually is made by the local government and spelled out in the contract with the cable company chosen to operate the franchise . There are alternative options to public access that give the public an opportunity for free expression , but still permit the cable company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One option is another category of local cable channels , usually called community access , which is not subject to the same rules as public access . Such channels , where they do exist , often are instituted by local ordinance . Sometimes they exist alongside public access , and sometimes instead of it . With community access , the cable station can decide whether or not it wants to air a controversial show . When a cable franchise approaches expiration , a city and its cable company may wish to discuss changes in the choices offered to viewers . On occasion , cities and cable operators have considered , in the course of franchise renewal negotiations , switching from a public access channel to community access channel . The courts have not ruled on the permissibility of such a change . * The time of day a show appears on public access can have an effect on the size and age of the viewing audience . Where a station 's policies permit , offensive programs can be run in less desirable time slots , such as after midnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of children or teenagers exposed to the propaganda appeals of hatemongers . In addition , a cable system can make reasonable decisions about how frequently a program is shown or how often an individual producer or sponsor can present his material . * Some cable companies set priorities for programs submitted for public access . Locally produced material may be given first priority , for viewing at a regular time each week . Those submitted by local residents , but produced outside , may be accorded second priority , for regular , but less frequent , airing . Programs assigned third priority  --  those neither locally produced nor submitted by local residents  --  may be shown irregularly . The New York Times has reported that no one knows how many viewers watch public access channels , but " the consensus is that the audience is expanding . " Furthermore , a study in progress by the National Clearinghouse on Audience Research for Community Cable Broadcasting at Western Michigan University indicates that as many as 75% of those cable subscribers able to tune in to public access programs do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of these individuals discovers a " Race and Reason " or a Farrakhan harangue , these extremists have reached a huge audience . There is a special danger that young people , who particularly are drawn to television and often watch it indiscriminately , not only will stumble upon electronic hate , but will be influenced by it . Youngsters who may have had a run-in with a member of a minority group , for example , might be susceptible to the racist demagogy heard on these programs . To the extent that hate television succeeds in twisting the minds of even a small percentage of American youth , it has to be taken seriously . It also should be remembered that public access TV is but one of the effective new techniques being used by today 's hate movement to propagandize the public . The potential combined impact of their efforts on growing numbers of Americans presents too great a danger to be ignored . Yet , cable broadcasters and alert citizens are not defenseless . By using the tools outlined in the " Counteraction " section of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violating anyone 's constitutional rights . Community television programming is an innovative practice with many potential benefits , but its viewers need to be aware of its exploitation by hate-mongers .
