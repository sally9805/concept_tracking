Section : BOOKS , ARTS &; MANNERS <p> THE decades flanking the year 1800 turned out to be decisive in shaping the history of this country , and the rest of the world as well . Credit must go to a remarkable group of men who happened to live at the same time within a relatively small geographic area . Their names are etched in the minds and hearts of a grateful posterity : Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , George Washington , John Adams , James Madison , Alexander Hamilton . <p> The only reason to withhold the epithet one-time miracle ' from such a gathering of genius is the simultaneous existence of another small group of men , living and working within an even smaller geographic area an ocean away . Rather than through the mind , they reach our hearts through the ear . Their names : Joseph Haydn , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , Ludwig van Beethoven , Franz Schubert . Among them , they created most of the greatest music in existence . <p> America 's Founders did not materialize in a vacuum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much had gone before to prepare the ground , and there was John Locke . Similarly , music could look back upon some distinguished centuries , and there was Johann Sebastian Bach . Yet in terms both of quantity and of quality what occurred simultaneously on the two sides of the Atlantic is without parallel . Until recently , it appeared that the principles of America 's Founders were secure . <p> Until recently , flagship orchestras of the world built their annual programs around the vast treasury bequeathed to us by the giants . In every season , there would be adequate representation of the greater and lesser Romantics of the nineteenth century , a selection from the early eighteenth and from the early twentieth , and space reserved for the music of our own time . Yet , just as the principles by which America lived were until recently those of Franklin , Washington , Jefferson , Adams , and Madison , the core of orchestral programming every year would be provided by Bach , Haydn , Mozart , Beethoven , and Schubert . They were the men for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a universal language . To Haydn we owe the eternal forms : symphony , sonata , string quartet . Mozart brings us closest to Divine perfection . Beethoven taught music to speak a human language , capable of expressing the entire spectrum of the human experience , and , finally , to rise beyond the hold of gravity . Schubert touches the heart with the fewest notes of all . <p> Such thoughts were rushing through my mind as I surveyed the programs of the New York Philharmonic for the 1996 - 1997 season . Putting together programs , of course , is a truly ungrateful task . That which is left out always outweighs that which is included . The season must be popular in order to sell tickets , yet it should be balanced , and should afford a disproportionate opportunity for the country 's living composers . Add to this differences in taste and the need to reconcile the preferences of the music director with those of the guest artists , and the task becomes formidable indeed . <p> Criticizing is easier than producing , but I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the 1966 - 67 season , because that is about when our world began to change . By this , I mean the phenomenon of gradually phasing out and ultimately ignoring the past  --  the wish to dispense with the foundations altogether . <p> The New York Philharmonic kindly provided a copy of the earlier schedule . Interestingly , both seasons include performances of Verdi 's Requiem and Benjamin Britten 's War Requiem . Both seasons offer an enormous variety of composers and compositions . Both seasons make generous room for Americans and opportunities to hear first performances . <p> But there the similarities end . Now , in generic terms , the Philharmonic is a symphony orchestra , named for a composition consisting , generally , of four movements : an allegro ( occasionally with a slow introduction ) , a slow movement , a dance movement , and a lively finale . The word sinfonia began life referring to an orchestral curtain raiser to Neapolitan opera , but in the hands of Joseph Haydn it became the ultimate achievement in orchestral composition . <p> Haydn himself composed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote only nine , but those nine created an inferiority complex in his successors ; Brahms hesitated for 22 years before unveiling his first symphony . Between Beethoven and Brahms , the symphonies of Schubert , Mendelssohn , and Schumann maintained the line of succession . Others have composed symphonies  --  Tchaikovsky , Bruckner , Mahler , Dvorak , even Bizet  --  yet the main , Viennese line stretches from Haydn to Brahms . <p> In 1966 - 67 , the Philharmonic offered three symphonies by Haydn , one by Mozart , four by Beethoven , three by Schubert , one by Schumann , two by Brahms . This year , it is offering only one by Haydn , none by Mozart , two by Beethoven , three by Schubert ( the probable reason being the bicentennial of his birth ) , one by Schumann , one by Brahms . <p> This is a 50 per cent reduction on the symphonic side , but wait . The total Beethoven repertoire in 1966 - 67 included five overtures ( King Stephen , Egmont , Prometheus , Fidelio , and Leonore No. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs ) , the Seventh , the Eighth ( also in two programs ) , and the Ninth . There were also Piano Concertos No. 3 and No. 5 ( Emperor ) , the Violin Concerto , and the Missa Solemnis . This year , we have Symphonies No. 1 and No. 5 . That 's it . <p> Haydn has been reduced to one symphony ; Mozart to an overture and two piano concertos . Less Schubert will be heard in his bicentennial year than thirty years ago . No concertos by Schumann , or by Beethoven for that matter . <p> But a greater puzzle still is that , among the other 53 composers featured in 1996 - 97 ( Adams , Barber , Bartok , Berlioz , Bizet , Britten , Bru ch , Bruckner , Chopin , Copland , Debussy , Dukas , Dvorak , Elgar , Ell ington , Faure , Grieg , Hanson , Harris , Hindemith , Ives , Janacek , K ancheli , Katzer , Kirchner , Kodaly , Lieberson , Mahler , Mendelssohn , Mussorgsky , Perle , Piston , Prokofiev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ns , Schmittke , W. Schuman , Ses sions , Sibelius , R. Strauss , Stravinsky , Tanberg , Tchaikovsky , R. Thompson , Tippett , Tubin , Verdi , Vivaldi , Walton , Wilson ) one looks in vain for Bach , Handel , Liszt , Wagner , or Schoenberg  --  all present thirty years ago . Stravinsky gets one nod . At the same time , among them , Berlioz , Dvorak , and Rachmaninoff have 12 ( ! ) of their works performed . <p> DID I say , puzzle ' ' ? I misspoke . What we observe here is merely the reflection of a persistent development which affects all realms of society . The foregoing comparison presupposes reasonable agreement on matters of quality , greatness , importance . Every one of these categories involves values and judgment . Values , by definition , are absolute . Judgment is a faculty evolved , refined , cultivated over time . The fact is that , for the most part , our schools and our philanthropic institutions have forsaken every one of these categories . The masterwork has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reception ' ' ; keeping quiet until one has something to say has been supplanted by the right to self-expression . ' <p> Such is the environment in which the planners of programs operate . Does anyone even remember a time when concert series were supposed to shape the public taste by offering the finest ? That was the approach of Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy , the brilliant young man who laid the foundations of the modern season . He did so in a warehouse of the linen merchants of Leipzig called the Gewandhaus  --  the original of the organization that sent us Kurt Masur , present music director of the New York Philharmonic . Mendelssohn built his Historic Series around the finest works of past and present . He had already made history at the age of twenty by re-introducing Bach 's Passion According to St. Matthew a century after its long-forgotten premiere . Now he began to build a middle-class audience with a taste for great music , introducing them to Mozart , Beethoven , Schumann , and Schubert . <p> But the idea that artists should shape the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . I recall getting my first notice to that effect after a performance of Beethoven 's Fourth Piano Concerto . A charming young lady , who attended the concert and the reception , apparently enjoyed my performance and included the composer in her compliments . It was just as beautiful as Scott Joplin , ' she suggested . ( The movie The Sting had just broken records , and millions had discovered Joplin 's compelling rags for the first time . ) I ventured to make the point that Beethoven and Joplin were hardly in comparable categories . She disagreed vehemently . The conductor , a close friend of mine , took her side . <p> The young lady was the victim of a common misapprehension : that , by creating a different category in this case , Beethoven , one denies Joplin his place . Nothing could be further from the truth . There are occasions when Joplin is more appropriate than Beethoven . Yet there is a need to observe the distinction between the functions of entertainment and those of art , and an additional need to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overboard , and it is Beethoven who is being denied his place . <p> Curiously , the same people who balk at the very suggestion of hierarchies in this context will find it quite natural to pay a great deal more for a BMW than for a Chevy Nova , will constantly upgrade their home computer , and , probably , have gone on to $200 gym shoes . The only realm in which they steadfastly refuse to entertain a system of values is the spiritual , the intangible . <p> But ridiculing the opposition falls short of the explanation required . In this age of mega-libraries , CD supermarkets , and the Internet , how are new generations to divine what should claim their limited time and attention ? All matters of judgment and taste need cultivation  --  a slow process , which requires keeping company with the best . Only in the last thirty years have people ceased to believe that there is such a thing as best . ' Indeed , most people in most places and most of the time agreed on what that best ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Wagner against Verdi , but never Beethoven against Elgar . <p> We come to think of certain works as great because they have given more profound and defining experiences to more people in more places than others . A line is to be drawn between thrills and defining experiences . <p> It is especially vital for members of the musical profession to cultivate the company of the great , for it is here that their own best skills will be required and may be judged . Nothing puts the string section of an orchestra to a higher test than a Haydn symphony , because there is no wall of brass behind which to hide . Nothing exposes the weakness of the French horns or the first bassoon like Beethoven 's Fourth . <p> Was the young lady , then , not entitled to her opinion ? Of course she was entitled . But she should not have declined to entertain a better-informed opinion . Worse still , my friend should not have denied his old-fashioned views . That evening , as I suspected then and know now , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and informed opinion too intimidated to say , Stop . ' <p> Today , the uninformed do more than express opinions . From their ranks come lecturers on the rostrum , authors in the bookstore , and recipients of vast foundation grants . Some of them probably would find two Beethoven symphonies in a season two too many . <p> Performing artists are still subject to a kind of natural selection . Playing an instrument requires not only talent , but lifelong discipline . Similar rules used to apply to composition . Aspirants needed to demonstrate that they were competent to improvise on a theme , construct all basic forms of music , and write acceptable counterpoint , and that they knew their way around the instruments for which they were composing . And that was still just competence , perhaps enough to get a job , but not to bring forth works that would earn a place in the concert hall . That required talent , if not genius . <p> But those days are gone . The current absence of any measurement of competence favors the charlatan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title artist ' often requires little more than a pronouncement by the person in question . How does a planner of programs determine quality ? How does one fulfill the obligation of presenting new vintages with any hope that one 's selection will be confirmed by posterity ? <p> Unless we retain an adequate proportion of the greatest works , we will lose our ability to evaluate new ones . We will be mired in quicksand , rather than standing on solid ground . Explanatory program notes , however eloquent , will never replace the way great music makes us feel , because great music speaks to the heart through the ear . If it does not reach our heart , it is not great ; if it does not reach us through the ear , it is not music . Should we forget this , we will be at the mercy of political , as opposed to aesthetic , considerations . <p> And here Vienna meets Philadelphia . How are we to judge today 's politicians , unless we keep company with America 's classic symphonies ? In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution that provide the yardstick . Just as a composer ought to be expected to write decent form and counterpoint , our politicians must demonstrate that they remain anchored in the founding principles . <p> We the public will then be able to decide whether to buy a season ticket . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By BALINT VAZSONYI <p> <p> Mr. Vazsonyi , a concert pianist and historian , is director of the Center for the American Founding , in Washington , D.C. <p>
