It was the worst of times ; it was the worst of times . Rayford Steele 's knees ached as he sat behind the wheel of the rented Lincoln . He had dropped to the pavement at the crushing realization of his pastor 's death . The physical pain , though it would stay with him for days , would prove minor compared to the mental anguish of having yet again lost one of the dearest people in his life . Rayford felt Amanda 's eyes on him . She laid one comforting hand on his thigh . In the backseat his daughter , Chloe , and her husband , Buck , each had a hand on his shoulder . What now ? Rayford wondered , What do we do without Bruce ? Where do we go ? The Emergency Broadcast System station droned on with the news of chaos , devastation , terror , and destruction throughout the world . Unable to speak over the lump in his throat , Rayford busied himself maneuvering his way through the incongruous traffic jams . Why were people out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of more bombs , or fallout ? " I need to get to the Chicago bureau office , " Buck said . " You can use the car after we get to the church , " Rayford managed . " I need to get the word out about Bruce . " Global Community peacekeeping forces supervised local police and emergency relief personnel directing traffic and trying to get people to return to their homes . Rayford relied on his many years in the Chicago area to use back roads and side streets to get around the major thoroughfares , which were hopelessly clogged . Rayford wondered if he should have taken Buck up on his offer to drive . But Rayford had not wanted to appear weak . He shook his head . There 's no limit to the pilot 's ego ! He felt as if he could curl into a ball and cry himself to sleep . Nearly two years since the vanishing of his wife and son , along with millions of others , Rayford no longer harbored illusions about his life in the twilight of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and regret . This was so hard .... Rayford knew his life could be even worse . Suppose he had not become a believer in Christ and was still lost forever . Suppose he had not found a new love and was alone . Suppose Chloe had also vanished . Or he had never met Buck . There was much to be grateful for . Were it not for the physical touch of the other three in that car , Rayford wondered if he would have had the will to go on . He could hardly imagine not having come to know and love Bruce Barnes . He had learned more and been enlightened and inspired more by Bruce than anyone else he 'd ever met . And it was n't just Bruce 's knowledge and teaching that made the difference . It was his passion . Here was a man who immediately and clearly saw that he had missed the greatest truth ever communicated to mankind , and he was not about to repeat the mistake . " Daddy , those two guards by the overpass seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm trying to ignore them , " Rayford said . " All these **32;217;TOOLONG think they have a better idea about where the traffic should go . If we listen to them , we 'll be here for hours . I just want to get to the church . " " He 's hollering at you with a bullhorn , " Amanda said , and she lowered her window a few inches . " You in the white Lincoln ! " came the booming voice . Rayford quickly turned off the radio . " Are you Rayford Steele ? " " How would they know that ? " Buck said . " Is there any limit to the Global Community intelligence network ? " Rayford said , disgusted . " If you 're Rayford Steele , " came the voice again , " please pull your vehicle to the shoulder ! " Rayford considered ignoring even that but thought better of it . There would be no outrunning these people if they knew who he was . But how did they know ? He pulled over . Buck Williams pulled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see two uniformed soldiers scampering down the embankment . He had no idea how Global Community forces had tracked down Rayford , but one thing was certain : it would not be good for Buck to be discovered with Carpathia 's pilot . " Ray , " he said quickly , " I 've got one set of phony IDs in the name of Herb Katz . Tell ' em I 'm a pilot friend of yours or something . " " OK , " Rayford said , " but my guess is they 'll be deferential to me . Obviously , Nicolae is merely trying to reconnect with me . " Buck hoped Rayford was right . It made sense that Carpathia would want to make sure his pilot was all right and could somehow get him back to New Babylon . The two uniforms now stood behind the Lincoln , one speaking into a walkie-talkie , the other on a cell phone . Buck decided to go on the offensive and opened his door . " Please remain in the vehicle , " Walkie-Talkie said . Buck slumped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real ones . Chloe looked terrified . Buck put his arm around her and drew her close . " Carpathia must have put out an all points bulletin . He knew your dad had to rent a car , so it did n't take long to track him down . " Buck had no idea what the two GC men were doing behind the car . All he knew was that his entire perspective on the next five years had changed in an instant . When global war broke out an hour before , he wondered if he and Chloe would survive the rest of the Tribulation . Now with the news of Bruce 's death , Buck wondered if they wanted to survive . The prospect of heaven and being with Christ sure seemed better than living in whatever remained of this world , even if Buck had to die to get there . Walkie-Talkie approached the driver's-side window . Rayford lowered it . " You are Rayford Steele , are you not ? " " Depends on who 's asking , " Rayford said . " This car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone claiming to be Rayford Steele . If that 's not you , you 're in deep trouble . " " Would n't you agree , " Rayford said , " that regardless who I am , we 're all in deep trouble ? " Buck was amused at Rayford 's feistiness , in light of the situation . " Sir , I need to know if you are Rayford Steele . " " I am . " " Can you prove that , sir ? " Rayford appeared as agitated as Buck had ever seen him . " You flag me down and holler at me through a bullhorn and tell me I 'm driving Rayford Steele 's rental car , and now you want me to prove to you that I 'm who you think I am ? " " Sir , you must understand the position I 'm in . I have Global Community potentate Carpathia himself patched through to a secure cell phone here . I do n't even know where he 's calling from . If I put someone on the phone and tell the potentate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayford Steele . " Buck was grateful that Rayford 's cat-and-mouse game had taken the spotlight off the others in the car , but that did n't last . Rayford slipped from his breast pocket his ID wallet , and as the GC man studied it , he asked idly , " And the others ? " " Family and friends , " Rayford said . " Let 's not keep the potentate waiting . " " I 'm going to have to ask you to take this call outside the car , sir . You understand the security risks . " Rayford sighed and left the car . Buck wished Walkie-Talkie would disappear too , but he merely stepped out of Rayford 's way and pointed him toward his partner , the one with the phone . Then he leaned in and spoke to Buck . " Sir , in the event that we transport Captain Steele to a rendezvous point , would you be able to handle the disposition of this vehicle ? " Do all uniformed people talk this way ? Buck wondered . " Sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Wherever Mr. Steele is going , I 'm going . " " That will be up to the potentate , " the guard said , " and providing there 's room in the chopper . " " Yes sir , " Rayford said into the phone , " I 'll see you soon then . " Rayford handed the cell phone to the second guard . " How will we get to wherever we 're supposed to go ? " " A copter should be here momentarily . " Rayford motioned for Amanda to pop the trunk but to stay in the car . As he shouldered both their bags , he leaned in her window and whispered . " Amanda and I have to rendezvous with Carpathia , but he could n't even tell me where he was or where we would meet . That phone is only so secure . I get the feeling it 's not far away , unless they 're coptering us to an airfield from which we 'll fly somewhere else . Buck , you 'd better get this car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too easy to connect you with me otherwise . " Five minutes later Rayford and Amanda were airborne . " Any idea where we 're going ? " Rayford shouted to one of the Global Community guards . The guard Clapped the chopper pilot on the shoulder and shouted , " Are we at liberty to say where we 're going ? " " Glenview ! " the pilot hollered . " Glenview Naval Air Station has been closed for years , " Rayford said . The chopper pilot turned to look at him . " The big runway 's still open ! The man 's there now ! " Amanda leaned close to Rayford . " Carpathia 's in Illinois already ? " " He must have been out of Washington before the attack . I thought they might have taken him to one of the bomb shelters at the Pentagon or the National Security Administration , but his intelligence people must have figured those would be the first places the militia would attack . " * * * " This reminds me of when we were first married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean when we were first married ' ? We 're still newlyweds ! " " Shh ! " Buck said quickly . " What 're they saying about New York City ? " Chloe turned up the radio . " ... devastating carnage everywhere here in the heart of Manhattan . Bombed-out buildings , emergency vehicles picking their way through debris , Civil Defense workers pleading with people over loudspeakers to stay underground . " Buck heard the panic in the reporter 's voice as he continued . " I 'm seeking shelter myself now , probably too late to avoid the effects of radiation . No one knows for certain if the warheads were nuclear , but everyone is being urged to take no risks . Damage estimates will be in the billions of dollars . Life as we know it here may never be the same . There 's devastation as far as the eye can see . " All major transportation centers have been closed if not destroyed . Huge traffic jams have snarled the Lincoln Tunnel , the Triborough Bridge , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known as the capital of the world looks like the set of a disaster movie . Now back to the Cable News/Global Community News Network in Atlanta . " " Buck , " Chloe said , " our home . Where will we live ? " Buck did n't answer . He stared at the traffic and wondered at the billowing clouds of black smoke and intermittent balls of orange flame that seemed to hover directly over Mt . Prospect . It was like Chloe to worry about her home . Buck was less concerned about that . He could live anywhere and seemed to have lived everywhere . As long as he had Chloe and shelter , he was all right . But she had made their ridiculously expensive Fifth Avenue penthouse flat her own . Finally , Buck spoke . " They wo n't let anybody back into New York for days , maybe longer . Even our vehicles , if they survived , wo n't be available to us . " " What are we going to do , Buck ? " Buck wished he knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the trademark of his career . Regardless of the obstacle , he had somehow made do in every imaginable situation or venue in the world at one time or another . Now , with his new , young wife beside him , not knowing where she would live or how they would manage , he was at a loss . All he wanted to do was to make sure his father-in-law and Amanda were safe , in spite of the danger of Rayford 's work , and to somehow get to Mt . Prospect to assess what was happening to the people of New Hope Village Church and to inform them of the tragedy that had befallen their beloved pastor . Buck had never had patience for traffic jams , but this was ridiculous . His jaw tightened and his neck stiffened as his palms squeezed the wheel . The late-model car was a smooth ride , but inching along in near gridlock made the huge automotive power plant feel like a stallion that wanted to run free . Suddenly an explosion rocked their car and nearly lifted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the windows blown in around them . Chloe shrieked and buried her head in Buck 's chest . Buck scanned the horizon for what might have caused the concussion . Several cars around them quickly pulled off the road . In the rearview mirror Buck saw a mushroom cloud slowly rise and assumed it was in the neighborhood of O'Hare International Airport , several miles away . CNN/GCN radio almost immediately reported the blast . " This from Chicago : Our news base there has been taken out by a huge blast . No word yet on whether this was an attack by militia forces or a Global Community retaliatory strike . We have so many reports of warfare , bloodshed , devastation , and death in so many major cities around the globe that it will be impossible for us to keep up with all of it .... " Buck looked quickly behind him and out both side windows . As soon as the car ahead gave him room , he whipped the wheel left and punched the accelerator . Chloe gasped as the car jumped the curb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buck drove on a parkway and passed long lines of creeping vehicles . " What are you doing , Buck ? " Chloe said , bracing herself on the dashboard . " I do n't know what I 'm doing , babe , but I know one thing I 'm not doing : I 'm not poking along in a traffic jam while the world goes to hell . " * * * The guard who had flagged down Rayford from the overpass now lugged his and Amanda 's baggage out of the helicopter . He led the Steeles , ducking under the whirring blades , across a short tarmac and into a single-story brick building at the edge of a long airstrip . Weeds grew between the cracks in the runway . A small Learjet sat at the end of the strip close to the chopper , but Rayford noticed no one in the cockpit and no exhaust from the engine . " I hope they do n't expect me to fly that thing ! " he hollered at Amanda as they hurried inside . " Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy who flew it here will get you as far as Dallas and the big plane you 'll be flying . " Rayford and Amanda were ushered to garishly colored plastic chairs in a small , shabbily appointed military office , decorated in early Air Force . Rayford sat , gingerly massaging his knees . Amanda paced , stopping only when their escort motioned that she should sit down . " I am free to stand , am I not ? " she said . " Suit yourself . Please wait here a few moments for the potentate . " C * * * Buck was waved at , pointed at , and hollered at by traffic cops , and he was honked at and obscenely gestured at by other motorists . He was not deterred . " Where are you going ? " Chloe insisted . " I need a new car , " he said . " Something tells me it 's going to be our only chance to survive . " " What are you talking about ? " " Do n't you see , Chlo ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It 's not going to end soon . It 's going to be impossible to drive a normal vehicle anywhere . " " So what 're you gon na do , buy a tank ? " " If it was n't so conspicuous , I just might . " Buck cut across a huge grassy field , through a parking lot , and beside a sprawling suburban high school . He drove between tennis courts and across soccer and football fields , throwing mud and sod in the air as the big car fishtailed . Radio reports continued from around the world with news of casualties and mayhem while Buck Williams and his bride careened on , speeding through yield signs and sliding around curves . Buck hoped he was somehow pointed in the right direction . He wanted to wind up on Northwest Highway , where a series of car dealerships comprised a ghetto of commercialism . A last sweeping turn led Buck out of the subdivision , and he saw what his favorite traffic reporter always said was " heavy , slow , stop-and-go " traffic all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a groove , so he just kept going . Pulling around angry drivers , he rode along a soft shoulder for more than a mile until he came upon those car dealerships . " Bingo ! " he said . * * * Rayford was stunned , and he could tell Amanda was too , at the demeanor of Nicolae Carpathia . The dashing young man , now in his mid-thirties , had seemingly been thrust to world leadership against his own will overnight . He had gone from being nearly an unknown in the lower house of Romanian government to president of that country , then almost immediately had displaced the secretary-general of the United Nations . After nearly two years of peace and a largely successful campaign to charm the masses following the terror-filled chaos of the global vanishings , Carpathia now faced significant opposition for the first time . Rayford had not known what to expect from his boss . Would Carpathia be hurt , offended , enraged ? He seemed none of the above . Ushered by Leon Fortunato , a sycophant from the New Babylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenview Naval Air Station , Carpathia seemed excited , high . " Captain Steele ! " Carpathia exalted . " Al , uh , An , uh , Mrs. Steele , how good to see you both and to know that you are well ! " " It 's Amanda , " Amanda said . " Forgive me , Amanda , " Carpathia said , reaching for her hand with both of his . Rayford noticed how slow she was to respond . " In all the excitement , you understand ... " The excitement , Rayford thought . Somehow World War III seems more than excitement . Carpathia 's eyes were ablaze , and he rubbed his hands together , as if thrilled with what was going on . " Well , people , " he said , " we need to get headed home . " Rayford knew Carpathia meant home to New Babylon , home to Hattie Durham , home to Suite 216 , the potentate 's entire floor of luxuriously appointed offices in the extravagant and sparkling Global Community headquarters . Despite Rayford and Amanda 's sprawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever remotely considered New Babylon home . Still rubbing his hands as if he could barely contain himself , Carpathia turned to the guard with the walkie-talkie . " What is the latest ? " The uniformed GC officer had a wire plugged in his ear and appeared startled that he had been addressed directly by Carpathia himself . He yanked out the earplug and stammered , " What ? I mean , pardon me , Mr. Potentate , sir . " Carpathia leveled his eyes at the man . " What is the news ? What is happening ? " " Uh , nothing much different , sir . Lots of activity and destruction in many major cities . " It seemed to Rayford that Carpathia was having trouble manufacturing a look of pain . " Is this activity largely centered in the Midwest and East Coast ? " the potentate asked . The guard nodded . " And some in the South , " he added . " Virtually nothing on the West Coast then , " Carpathia said , more a statement than a question . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believed Carpathia was Antichrist himself would have interpreted Carpathia 's look as one of satisfaction , almost glee . " How about Dallas/Ft . Worth ? " Carpathia asked . " DFW suffered a hit , " the guard said . " Only one major runway is still open . Nothing 's coming in , but lots of planes are heading out of there . " Carpathia glanced at Rayford . " And the military strip nearby , where my pilot was certified on the 757 ? " " I believe that 's still operational , sir , " the guard said . " All right then , very good , " Carpathia said . He turned to Fortunato . " I am certain no one knows our whereabouts , but just in case , what do you have for me ? ' The man opened a canvas bag that seemed incongruous to Rayford . Apparently he had gathered Air Force leftovers for a disguise for Carpathia . He produced a cap that did n't match a huge , dress overcoat . Carpathia quickly donned the getup and motioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The jet pilot is where ? " he asked . " Waiting just outside the door , per your instructions , sir , " Fortunato said . Carpathia pointed to the armed guard . " Thank you for your service . You may return to your post via the helicopter . Mr. Fortunato and the Steeles and I will be flown to a new plane , on which Captain Steele will transport me back to New Babylon . " Rayford spoke up . " And that is in ? " Carpathia raised a hand to silence him . " Let us not give our young friend here any information he would have to be responsible for , " he said , smiling at the uniformed guard . " You may go . " As the man hurried away , Carpathia spoke quietly to Rayford . " The Condor 216 awaits us near Dallas . We will then fly west to go east , if you know what I mean . " " I 've never heard of a Condor 216 , " Rayford said . " It 's unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Carpathia interrupted , " that you are more than qualified . " " But what is a Condor 2 " " A hybrid I designed and named myself , " Carpathia said . " Surely you do not think what has happened here today was a surprise to me . " " I 'm learning , " Rayford said , sneaking a glance at Amanda , who appeared to be seething . " You are learning , " Carpathia repeated , smiling broadly . " I like that . Come , let me tell you about my spectacular new aircraft as we travel . " Fortunato raised a forefinger . " Sir , my recommendation is that you and I run together to the end of the airstrip and board the jet . The Steeles should follow when they see us get on board . " Carpathia held the oversized hat down onto his styled hair and slipped in behind Fortunato as the aide opened the door and nodded to the waiting jet pilot . The pilot immediately took off running toward the Learjet as Fortunato and Carpathia jogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waist and drew her close . " Rayford , " Amanda said , " have you ever once in your life heard Nicolae Carpathia misspeak ? " " Misspeak ? " " Stutter , stammer , have to repeat a word , forget a name ? " Rayford suppressed a smile , amazed he could find anything humorous on what could easily be the last day of his life on earth . " Besides your name , in other words ? " " He does that on purpose , and you know it , " she said . Rayford shrugged . " You 're probably right . But with what motive ? " " I have no idea , " she said . " Hon , do you see no irony in your being offended by the man we 're convinced is the Antichrist ? " Amanda stared at him . " I mean , " he continued , " listen to yourself . You expect common courtesy and decency from the most evil man in the history of the universe ? " Amanda shook her head and looked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she muttered , " I suppose I am being oversensitive. " * * * Buck sat in the sales manager 's office of a Land Rover dealership . " You never cease to amaze me , " Chloe whispered . " I 've never been conventional , have I ? " " Hardly , and now I suppose any hope of normalcy is out the window . " " I do n't need any excuse for being unique , " he said , " but everyone everywhere will be acting impulsively soon enough . " The sales manager , who had busied himself with paperwork and figuring a price , turned the documents and slid them across the desk toward Buck . " You 're not trading the Lincoln , then ? " " No , that 's a rental , " Buck said . " But I am going to ask you to return that to O'Hare for me . " Buck looked up at the man without regard to the documents . " That 's highly unusual , " the sales manager said . " I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could get back . " Buck stood . " I suppose I am asking too much . Another dealer will be willing to go the extra mile to sell me a vehicle , I 'm sure , especially when no one knows what tomorrow may bring . " " Sit back down , Mr. Williams . I wo n't have any trouble getting my district manager to sign off on throwing in that little errand for you . As you can see , you 're going to be able to drive your fully loaded Range Rover out of here within an hour for under six figures . " " Make it half an hour , " Buck said , " and we 've got a deal . " The sales manager rose and thrust out his hand . " Deal . "
