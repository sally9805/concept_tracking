Section : COVER STORY You will need fresh strategies for your career , your housing choices and your investments . <p> Faster than you can say $30 a barrel , Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait transformed the prevailing attitude on the economy from guarded optimism to low-grade anxiety . Growth had turned feeble even before Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait . Now , with oil supplies squeezed and Consumers showing in creasing signs of a siege mentality , recession seems all but inevitable . Indeed ; many forecasters assume a slump has ill-ready begun . Says A. Gary Shilling , president of the New York City economic consulting firm bearing his name : " The invasion was the final nail in the coffin of the 1980s economic expansion . " <p> Recession . It ca n't be . We 've dodged one after another since 1982 , making for the longest peacetime stretch of economic growth since World War II . But get ready . The streak is probably over . No need to break out the Prozac , though . Barring a prolonged war in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy will contract by a moderate 1% or so before resuming sluggish growth by the middle of next year . In all , that makes for a fairly mild recession  --  the average dip lasts 11 months and shaves 2.1% off the gross national product  --  and it pales in comparison with the 16-month tooth rattler of 1981-82 , when the GNP shrank prospects : <p> The unemployment rate could reach 6.5% , or 8.1 million jobless , up from 5.6% and 7 million today . <p> Inflation may peak at around 6.5% , up from its recent 5.8% annual rate . <p> The recovery , when it comes , is likely to be feeble . " We 're in for a long period of weak growth with nagging inflation of 4% to 6% ; " says Allen Sinai , chief economist for the Boston Co . " The next reassuringly good period will start in 1992 , and that 's being optimistic . " <p> Of course , statistical aggregates and economists ' often changeable predictions provide little clue to the precise impact of a recession on you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all with nothing worse than a dim awareness of distant economic rumbling will depend on where you live and work and , above all , on your financial preparedness . Remember too that the economic consensus hinges on assumptions  --  in particular , about averting a shooting war in the Middle East  --  that may turn out to be far too optimistic . ( For a look at what to do if fighting erupts , see the box on page 78 . ) Still , do n't try to outpsyche the Mideast crisis or the U.S. economy , moving your money with each day 's headlines . Rather , take measures that will safeguard your finances , regardless of events beyond your control . <p> In fact , if you 're like nearly a third of the MONEY subscribers recently . polled by the Gallup Organization ( see page 79 ) , you already have made some moves . If not , now is the time to reassess your job prospects and adjust your saving , spending and investing strategies . Here , then , are your best financial strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The security of your . job will depend heavily on where you live and the industry in which you work . The industrial states of New England , with their recent 6% average unemployment rate , will probably retain their unenviable ranking as the nation 's worst job market ; unemployment there could jump to 7% or more . But in virtually every region , workers in construction , automotive and defense companies ( despite Mideast tensions ) are likely to be hit hard by layoffs . The construction and auto industries , where unemployment already runs 11.1% and 7.4% , respectively , could eliminate another 200,000 jobs , or an extra 4% of the work force in those fields . And defense companies and their suppliers could h ) se 430,000 jobs , or 10% of the total , in 1990 and 1991 , according to George F. Brown Jr. , an economist and defense Specialist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington , Mass . The most secure employers are expected to be food companies , consumer product manufacturers and pharmaceutical firms . <p> Even if your job seems assured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income growth to which you may have become accustomed . A slower economy means less overtime , dwindling commissions and bonuses , and measly raises . According to an annual survey by management consultant William M. Mercer Inc. , average nonunion salary increases will drop to 5.4% in 1991 from their current 5.5% . The decline may not sound like much , but it could pinch hard . According to the survey , next year could be the first since 1980 in which salary increases do n't keep pace with inflation . <p> The key to protecting your job and pay is to keep your performance high , perhaps by adding new skills . " In the past , companies generally fired only the notoriously incompetent , " says Alan M. Johnson , managing director of executive compensation at the New York City recruiting firm of Handy Associates . " Now they 're much more likely to take action against average employees . " Then too , this is probably not the time to trade in a steady paycheck and start that bed and breakfast you have always dreamed of owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you do n't want to be a firm 's last hired employee just as the economy sours . <p> Build your savings . Normally , you should keep an amount equal to three months ' living expenses as an emergency reserve , preferably in a money-market fund , where the cash is readily accessible . With the economy faltering , however , you should have at least twice as much , especially if your job is vulnerable or you Work for commissions . <p> Obviously , you Ca n't build up a fund of such proportions overnight . But there are quick , if not altogether painless , ways to beef up . Begin with spending cuts that allow you to reroute cash outlays into savings . To control impulse spending , quit carrying your automated teller machine card . Instead , plan how much your family will need between paychecks and take that amount in cash on payday ; then bank whatever is left over . To slam the brakes on credit-card outlays , put all but one of your cards in your safe-deposit box  --  and leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of your debt . What may have been a comfortable level of debt during prosperous times could easily turn onerous during a recession . Reason as earnings flatten and the cost of living continues to rise , essential outlays on such things as food and energy take up more of your budget , leaving less money for debt service . <p> As a rule , your mortgage should eat up no more than 25% of your take-home pay and your total debt no more than 40% . If your salary will be at risk in a recession , however , reduce your debt as much as possible while you still have a steady income . Your priority should be to eliminate credit-card debt with an average interest rate of 18.7% , credit cards are an outlandishly expensive way to borrow . For a quick psychological lift , target one or two cards with relatively smaller balances and pay them off in full first . <p> If you are are n't at risk of suffering a loss of income , it may make sense to take out a home-equity-loan to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are typically pegged 1.5 points or so above the prime rate , currently 10% . Also ; unlike payments on consumer debt , interest on home-equity loans of up to $100,000 is fully tax deductible . But do n't fall into a common trap . " Many homeowners resame using their credit cards as soon as they become comfortable with the lower monthly payments on their home-equity loan , " says Mary Merrill , a financial adviser in Madison ; Wis . " The result is higher overall debt . " <p> If you run into trouble and ca n't keep current on your debts , notify your creditors immediately . If you are behind on a home-equity loan , the lender may be willing to accept interest-only payments temporarily . If you need to cut a deal to reduce consumer-loan bills , turn to a nonprofit credit counseling agency such as Consumer Credit Counseling Service ( 800-388-2227 ) , which is funded by banks , finance companies and other businesses . The counselor 's intercession signals the creditor that you are serious about eventually paying up . <p> Make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as San Francisco and Los Angeles have seen housing prices dip in the past year . Recession will only steepen the downward spiral . So if it makes sense to remodel rather than sell , do so . One bright side : once-overbooked remodeling contractors are likely to be available and price competitive , thanks to the slowdown in construction . Housing starts , for example , recently sank to an annualized rate of 1.14 million , the lowest since the recession of 1982 . <p> On the other hand , if you are a first-time buyer  --  or if you 're a trade-up buyer willing to take less to sell your old home  --  you may be able to get more house for your money than at any time in nearly a decade . That 's true not only because many areas are distinct buyers ' markets these days , but also because adjustable-rate mortgages are likely to be Particularly attractive . Reason : ARM rates are typically tied to yields on short-term securities ; and during times of recession and international tension , investors often pile into these securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf crisis , for example , introductory ARM rates have hovered around 8.2% , while 30-year fixed rates have jumped from 9.9% to 11. ) .3% . <p> One caveat : before you think about buying a house  --  or any major purchase during a recession  --  ask yourself these questions : Is my job secure ? Do I have a six months ' emergency fund ? Can I afford the payments without sacrificing my long-term savings ? And can I meet the payments without a raise ? If you can answer yes to each , let the good times roll . <p> Stand by your stocks and bonds . Forget apocalypse now . While the staggering economy virtually guarantees further market gyrations , this is n't the moment to liquidate your assets and pour everything into CDs and money-market funds , ( Some newsletter editors disagree , however ; see Wall Street on page 67 . ) Market timing is notoriously difficult even in placid times ; now , with stocks and bonds bucking like skittish colts at every new development in the Middle East , timing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better tactic is to arrange your investments so that every new crisis does n't provoke a new headache . <p> The basic strategy : diversification . Keep the money that you will need within five years where it is perfectly safe , such as in Treasury bills , CDs or money-market funds . Split longer-term dough about fifty-fifty between equities and fixed-income securities . Push the balance more toward stocks if you 're young , enjoy secure employment or have a venturesome nature ; beef up the fixed-income weighting if you 're getting within live years of your goat or if you 're just constitutionally risk-shy . <p> As for any fresh dollars that you may have on hand for long-term investments , now is a good time to start cautiously looking for bargains . True , the looming recession may well drive the Dow 10% to 15% lower than its early September level of 2600 ( see Money W Forecast on page 19 ) . But as Daniel Seiver , author of Outperforming Wall Street ( Prentice-Hall , $19.95 ) , warns , " There 's simply no way an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should start buying as soon as you think stocks look cheap . " Be selective and do n't rush in all at once . Instead , invest in stages : commit equal dollar amounts every quarter , say  --  but no more often than once a week or for every 50-point drop in the Dow . <p> You might start by making sure you are diversified internationally . Jonathan Pond , editor of the Wiesenberger Mutual Funds Investment Report , recommends that 20% of the money you have earmarked for equities be invested abroad , where economic growth is expected to be brisker than here . Mutual funds offer American investors the most convenient access to foreign bourses , but Pond cautions against funds invested solely in a single country or region . His pick : well-diversified Fidelity Overseas ( 3% load ; 800-544-8888 ; up 222% in the five years to Sept. 1 ) . <p> On the domestic front , Morton Silverman , portfolio strategist with Piper Jarfray &; Hopwood in Minneapolis , suggests that stock pickers consider giant blue chips such as ConAgra ( recently traded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( NYSE , $26.75 ) and PepsiCo ( NYSE , $24.50 ) . " Because these companies sell staples , all of them should be relatively insensitive to a slowing U.S. economy , and all have large or growing international businesses , " he says . A similarly recession-resistant small growth company with expanding overseas sales is St. Jude Medical ( recently traded over the counter at $30 ) . To bolster the yield cushion in your portfolio , Silverman recommends solid utilities such as Iowa Resources ( NYSE , $20.75 ; recently yielding 8.1% ) and US West ( NYSE , $34.25 ; 5.8% ) . <p> Many economists expect that a recession would bring the yields on long-term bonds , lately around 9% , as low as 8% next year . That would give 20-year Treasuries a one-year total return of around 20% . In the short run , however , the threat of oil-price inflation could push rates up as high as 9.5% . Thus if you 're not prepared to ride out a tailspin in long bonds , keep your maturities well under 10 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.J. " We do n't have any clients out longer than six to eight years , and most are holding three- to five-year maturities . " Your safest bets are Treasury notes , though if you prefer the convenience of a bond fund , Enright suggests Neuberger &; Berman Limited Maturity ( no load ; 800-877-9700 ; average maturity : 2.6 years ) , which holds a mix of governments and high-grade corporates . <p> If ever the temptation to hide out in money markets or CDs threatens to get the better of you in the months ahead , remember this recessions and bear markets all end eventually , and the often dramatic rebounds usually begin when the news seems bleakest . James Stack , editor of Inves Tech Market Analyst , points out that in all five economic downturns since 1960 , the Dow began to recover anywhere from three to six months before the economy did . " Investors who wait for economists to declare the official end of the recession , " Stack warns , " will be left in the dust by the next bull market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. SMITH <p> WHAT TO DO IF WAR BREAKS OUT OVER THERE <p> The majority view among economists  --  that any near-term U.S. recession will be a mild one  --  hinges on the assumption that events in the Gulf crisis will stop short of outright fighting . Any nonviolent outcome , ranging from a negotiated settlement to a permanent cold-war-style standoff , would not alter the economic forecasts that are outlined in the main story . But a shooting war would  --  and not for the better . Two possible scenarios : <p> A prolonged war that results in far-reaching economic dislocations . Within hours of the first gunfire , look for stock prices to fall 150 points or more on the Dow . How far stocks ultimately could tumble and how much damage the U.S. economy might sustain depend mainly on the extent of destruction in Persian Gulf oilfields . The bottom line oil could plausibly go for as much as $50 a barrel for weeks or even months , a near tripling in price since just before the crisis . While oil is at these levels , the inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product could shrivel at a 2% to 3% annual rate , adding over a million to the nation 's jobless rolls and boosting the unemployment rate from its recent 5.6% level to around 7% . <p> Under such grim circumstances , you would need to be even more circumspect in all your career and spending decisions . You should consider building your emergency savings to six to nine months ' worth of living expenses , and do not take on additional debt unless you are extremely confident of your income security . Go slow on your investments , concentrating on short-term Treasuries and stocks of companies with secure dividends and strong balance sheets . <p> A quick U.S. victory with minimal disruption of oil supplies . As mentioned before , the outbreak of fighting would send stocks diving and oil prices soaring . But if it quickly became clear that a resolution favorable to the U.S. was in the offing , oil would probably retreat to a manageable range of $25 to $28 a barrel and the Dow could rebound dramatically ( though once the initial euphoria wore off , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the dimensions of any recession would probably approximate those outlined in the accompanying article , although they might take longer to become apparent . " A short , victorious strike would give a short-run charge to the economic battery , " says Murray Weidenbaum , director of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis . " But by early 1991 , we 'd be faced with the same slow growth indicators we had before the Iraqi invasion . " Therefore , do n't drop your financial guard even if the Mideast crisis is resolved swiftly . <p> By Teresa Tritch <p> READERS LIKE YOU ARE CUTTING BACK ON DEBT AND SPENDING <p> Pessimism about the economy is hardly confined these days to the ranks of professional economists . A sense of dark expectation prevails as well among many middle-class Americans-and that , as much as Saddam Hussein 's ambitions , may help to make recession unavoidable . <p> For example , in a poll of 300 MONEY subscribers conducted by the Gallup Organization shortly after Iraq 's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy . A full 83% in the poll ( margin of error plus or minus six percentage points ) said that a recession is likely within the next 12 months , and nearly a third have already taken steps to prepare . The most common moves : increase savings ( 30% ) and cut spending ( 25% ) . <p> Other recent surveys reveal a similar drop in consumer confidence , which according to many economists is the most sensitive signal of a nation 's vulnerability to recession . The Conference Board 's consumer confidence index , which had been dropping since January , fell in August to its lowest level in more than seven years . A similar index from the University of Michigan took a parallel plunge . For both polls , it was the sharpest monthly drop since just before previous recessions . <p> Such an erosion in confidence can cause consumers to hit the brakes . Indeed , the MONEY/Gallup poll found that 37% have reduced personal or household expenditures since early summer , though not all in anticipation of recession . Nearly a third have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put off major home improvements , and two in five have cut back on discretionary outlays like dinners out and movies . At the same time , 51% have sliced consumer debt over the past year and , of those , a fifth have eliminated it entirely . <p> The MONEY subscribers revealed a sharp split , however , in their perception of the precise economic problems that they face . When asked whether inflation or recession would be the more pressing problem in the year ahead , 46% answered recession-while 39% pointed to inflation . Still , many subscribers maintain a sturdy optimism about their personal prospects : 49% feel no more concerned about their own finances than at the beginning of the summer . Half of those employed , in fact , are less concerned than a year ago about losing their jobs . Two-thirds expect a pay raise this year and , of those optimists , a whopping 77% think it will be the same or better than last year 's  --  a view that conflicts with many employers ' plans ( see the main article ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect naively or bullheadedness . If you have a secure cash flow and the ability to focus on what lies beyond the rough patch ahead , you have an excellent chance of emerging from a recession in even stronger shape than when you went in . As the accompanying story points out , a downturn may present excellent opportunities for bargain-hunting investors and home buyers . <p> Bargain hunting , in fact , is exactly what Michael and Tina Zarro of Lawndale , Calif. have in mind . When Michael , 35 , was recently named a partner at his law firm , he and Tina , 33 , decided his enhanced earning power and new job security will allow them to reach for their dream house . So they have put their four-bedroom home on the market at $485,000 and plan to offer around $750,000 for a more upscale model in nearby Manhattan Beach , where prices have slumped as much as 10% in the past year . A recession could drive prices lower , of course , but the Zarros are n't concerned about catching the market s ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill , " Michael says .
