It is four a.m. and my parents and sister are gone to North Carolina for two weeks ' vacation , which means I have the house to myself . So : <p> I come out of the bathroom and the cat is sitting on top of the humidifier ( in the hallway , which is carpeted grayly but cleanly ) . The cat looks at me inquisitively ( to be expected from a feline , no ? ) and says , " Meow ? " So naturally I say to my cat , " Meow . " <p> " Mrow , " says the cat . <p> " Mrow , " I reply . <p> " Mraoo. " ( the cat ) <p> " Mraoo. " ( me ) <p> " Mrow ? " ( cat ) <p> " Mrow ? " ( the me ) <p> " ( maoo ) . " ( the feline ) <p> " ( maoo ) . " ( yours untruly ) <p> " Mrow ? " ( the feline again , somewhat more insistently ) <p> " Mrow ? " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am petting ( the cat ) . Now she becomes silent . I try a couple more cat words , not knowing what I speak , but Prissy ( short for Prissy Grey Bugeater ) remains mute . She purrs as I pet her and tell her ( now in my own familiar tongue ) that I find her somewhat lacking as a conversationalist , but nonetheless refuses further discourse . She is through . So naturally I do the natural thing to do , which is to grab the cat by the midsection and bash her against the wall numerous times until she is quite quite bloody , all the while her making a terrible racket <p> No , no , not really , silly . I 'm just kidding . It was just a joke . I love my cat and would never do anything to hurt her . Really , readerno , I did n't mean it . I 'm sorry , okay ? Please do n't go away . <p> I teach trombone lessons . That is to say , the children come and sit side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ( the location of which can not be revealed for reasons of national security ) , and we look together at the music stand and I teach . I teach them how to hold the horn and how to blow into it to make it sound good . I teach them how to breathe , how to hold their lips , what to do with their tongue and their right arm , and when they walk into a room to play an audition the first note they play fills the room with a sound the size of God 's voice . The walls shake with reboant vibrations and the judges bow down at their feet and beg for their favor and promise that not only they but their children and their grandchildren and their grandchildren 's grandchildren will always be first chair junior high Mid-State or first chair All-State ( senior high ) or whatever the case may be until the end of time , throughout eternity , that on Judgment Day they will be the ones to sound the trumpet calls heralding <p> Okay , so I exaggerated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's that ? You want a refund ? Too bad so sad . We 're here for the duration , whether you like it or not . Hell , we have n't even gotten to the good part yet . <p> So it 's the next afternoon , which for me is morning . At precisely 2:26:34 postmeridian ( okay , I know the " : 34 " part ca n't be precise , because those things are always changing , and it takes more than one to walk into the kitchen from the hallway ) , I enter the kitchen from the hallway by foot , at which time I am approached by the aforementioned bug-eating feline . <p> " Maarraaow , " she says . <p> " Are you hungry , Prissy ? " I reply in my standard kitty voice , higher in pitch and somewhat condescending . <p> " Mraaow ! " says the cat . " Maaow ? Mraaow ? " <p> " Looks like we 're out of kitty food , Prissy . I guess you 're out of luck . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent look on her white-whiskered countenance . <p> " Maybe if you had made that food last longer , you would n't be having this problem now . You should have planned ahead instead of being such a glutton . " " Mraow ? " <p> " That 's all there is . There is n't any more . They do n't make cat food anymore . They got tired of trying to satisfy rapacious felines such as yourself . " <p> " Mraow ? " <p> " I guess you 'll just have to make your own . I hear the Co-op is having a sale on bone meal this week . If you leave now you can probably make it there before they close . " <p> So then of course I fed the cat , after which I fed myself , after which I went into the living room and lay on my back on the purply carpeted floor and masturbated , after which I called my senator and demanded that the American public be protected from stories such as this , most especially my mother and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful intelligent loyal caring wife if I can ever find her in time before it 's too late <p> Sometimes when a young student is neglecting his practice I will tell him that if he continues to do so there will come a day when I step over to the wall and push my secret button ( hidden cleverly in the baseboard ) , at which point in time a trapdoor will open beneath the student and he will fall down into the alligator pit below with all my other students who failed to practice , never to be heard from again . At this point the sixth-grader 's eyes usually get a little bigger , although he is of course old enough to know I am only kidding . <p> I call our dog White Fang now . Her real name is Loretta Lee ( my mother 's doing , certainly not mine ) , but a few nights ago ( actually many nights , several months , maybe a year or more , who knows , time passes slowly when one has a college degree and is almost thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to howl . It was tentative howling , testing the waters if you will , and short-lived seeing as how I stepped from my room and told her to cut it out , but all the same I found it amusing and so now I call her White Fang . <p> So the local community band played a concert recently about thirty miles away , a Christmas concert . Some of the younger members rode with some of the older members , including an eighth-grade student of mine that rode with me . On the way to the concert we listened to Mahler 's Fifth , played by the Chicago Symphony , and when the tape got to the first heavy-duty trombone passage , one of those apocalyptic kind of things so common with Mahler and the trombone , one of those licks that choke me up half the time because I want to play like that so badly , I looked over at him through the winter night darkness inside the truck , and I could see that he was hit . I could see in his bespectacled face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changed him . Like I knew at that moment that someday he would take Friedman 's place as principal trombone of the Chicago Symphony . But then we played the concert and he plowed through key changes like a bull in a china shop . Which still does n't mean anything , really , I mean he 's only in the eighth grade and he can already play a three octave E-flat scale , far up into the land of treble clef , and sometimes he gets a really big sound <p> Sorry , readergo . I almost let that one get away from me . I 'll try not to let it happen again . I promise . You have my word on it . Scout 's honor . Honest Injun . I pledge allegiance to the flag <p> I used to be in the Army , as a trombone player . But I did n't like the Army , so I got out and came home . Which of course went over really well at home . Now I sleep all day , go to the gym in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hustle pool for money . When I come home at three or four in the morning , as I open the gate to the short gravel driveway that leads from the dead-end circle to my parents ' small old white ( painted ) brick house , I say " White Fang doggie " to the wagging dancing canine . Each night I tell myself that I must get back to writing , that the following evening I will stay home and get back to work , but of course it does not turn out that way . <p> On the way to the concert : <p> We saw a house covered with Christmas lights . " You could say they 're decorated , " my diminutive friend said . ( He is small , even for his age . ) <p> " Just a little bit , " I returned . " That probably took a few minutes to do . " <p> " Just a few , " he said . <p> " Actually , they probably have a little box with a button on it that holds all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out is push the button and it shoots them out and they 're there . Probably takes about five seconds . " <p> " Yeah , right . " <p> " And then when they get ready to take them down , they just push the other button  --  whoosh !  --  and all the lights fly back into the box . Five seconds tops . " <p> " Yeah , right . " He seems amused . <p> So then I ask him if he remembers , when he was in the sixth grade , what I told him I would do if he did n't practice . <p> " You mean the button on the wall and the alligator pit ? " <p> " That 's it . " <p> " With all your other students that did n't practice . You told me that my first lesson . " <p> " No , I did n't  --  not the first one . " <p> " Yes you did  --  I 'll never forget that . " He is happy in remembering . <p> " So what did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Man , this guy is weird . ' " He laughs goofily . <p> " Well , you were right . " <p> " Yep . Sure was . " <p> On the way back from the concert : <p> " You know this is crazy , but I 've been meaning to ask you this forever , " he says a little uncertainly , naively . " Do you have a girlfriend ? " <p> " No , I do n't , " I say . " I was dating Julia Roberts , but I had to let her go . She would n't give me any space . " <p> " Julia Roberts . Yeah , right . " He seems pleased with the answer . <p> So a couple days later my little friend 's mother calls me at home . They 're going to buy him a professional model trombone for Christmas , and they 'd like my advice . So I tell her to get a Bach 42b . <p> " Okay , now , what about a Bolton ? The man at the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they were what a lot of people were going to now . What do you think of them ? " <p> I explain to her that most professionals play Bachs . I also tell her about a mail-order company where she can get one about seven hundred dollars cheaper than from the music store . I give her the company 's toll-free number . <p> " So Bach is the best ? " she says . She is a very nice woman and has always been unusually cooperative , a great pleasure to deal with as far as parents go . I know she is only trying to do the right thing . <p> " Unless you get a Johnson . It 's a custom horn that 's just been out a few years , and they 're really expensive . They start at two thousand . He would n't need one of those unless he plays professionally someday . Even then he would n't necessarily need it , lots of professionals  --  most , actually  --  still play on Bachs . I guess it 's just a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I was rich I would buy the Johnson for my kid , which of course I do n't have any kids ( I 'm not even married ) and I 'm not rich . Are you rich , Mrs. Bigbottom ? Of course I guess a true parent would get the Johnson anyway , even if he ( she ) could n't afford it , he 'd find a way because he gave a damn about his kid . Do you give a damn about your kid , Mrs. Bigbottom ? Because it really does n't make a rat 's ass to me one way or the other what you get the little snot . To tell you the truth , I get tired of fuckin ' with the little shit because he does n't practice half the shit I give him to work on . To tell you the truth I 'd just as soon not have to teach the little bastard . I really do n't give a damn what you  --  " <p> Click , I hear . She has hung up . I just lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Christmas Eve service at our Episcopal church , and people are giving me dirty looks , particularly the older people my parents ' age . Like I 've betrayed them or something . They always used to smile at me like I was something special , like I had potential . <p> So I 'm waiting in line for communion , and I know it 's supposed to be serious , but I ca n't help cracking a big grin . I 've fought this impulse many times before in similar situations , and I always managed to keep it down . Not this time , though . There 's no stopping it  --  an irresistible force . <p> It just so happens that the young girl ( she looks to be about fifteen ) standing directly in front of me in line is wearing a tight purple dress , and it just so happens that trying its best to escape from the dress is one of the nicest derrieres I have ever witnessed . So naturally I just ease a step forward , right into the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all downhill from there , readerwoe . . . <p> <p> By Walt Foreman <p>
