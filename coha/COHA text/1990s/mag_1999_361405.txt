I 'm always jealous of people who have true passion . Jealous here mostly means " frightened . " So , when I found out there were people at about 100 theaters around the U.S. who have already been waiting in line for weeks to buy tickets for Episode 1  --  The Phantom Menace , I had to meet them . Were n't they already as sick of the movie as I was ? Did they not know there was a Star Wars cookbook out that had a recipe for " Boba Fett-uccine " ? How could they listen to George Lucas tell yet another interviewer that although we have progressed technologically as a race , we have not evolved emotionally . We have n't evolved emotionally , George ? You 're a 54-year-old man making a movie about a bad guy named " Darth Maul . " Compared to Lucas , I 'm John Gray , buddy . And to top it all off , it turns out this movie does n't even have Leonardo DiCaprio in it . Like I 'm going to see that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City 's Ziegfeld Theater at 9 p.m. to find something that could only generously be called a ticket line . Now , when I was a kid and you wanted to show how much you liked whichever four people happened to make up Yes at the time , you showed up with a sleeping bag and slept out for your tickets . You liked Yes so much you were willing to go to school smelling like you liked Yes . <P> But these guys had already been assured 250 tickets and just had to earn them by taking four-hour shifts collecting money for the Starlight Foundation outside the cinema . They had a name , NYLine Countdown to Star Wars , and 17 staff members , including a media-relations liaison , a sponsor-relations coordinator and a treasurer . They had a permit from the city , a hotel room across the street for showers , a pay phone hooked up to take phone calls from radio stations , and a tech-support van broadcasting a live webcam pointed at the theater . This , I assume , was to prove the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Star Wars tickets is watching people sleeping out for Star Wars tickets . <P> But after a while , I kind of did find their warped sense of community appealing . Not the part where they showed each other snapshots they took of upcoming Yoda Pepsi cans , but the part where they played Trivial Pursuit on the sidewalk , wrote " Fan of the Day " stories about each other for the website and held a dating-game contest . It was like a freshman dorm at a college where somebody in admissions misplaced the women 's applications . <P> One of the few women there , Jessica Keith , 24 , told me she turned down her boyfriend 's offer to buy her a $500 premiere ticket . " When you get older , there are n't as many big events to look forward to , " she says . " Birthdays are n't that big . Christmas is n't that big . This is a big cultural thing . " <P> Perhaps recapturing the excitement of youthful giddy anticipation was worth wading through the hype , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fellow Star Wars freak . " The relationship ended because he spent all his money on Star Wars toys and never wanted to go out , " she said . Sometimes it 's best to evolve .
