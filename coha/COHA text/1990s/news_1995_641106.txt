<p> Whye misrepresented efforts to fight gangs and drugs <p> Recent columns by Chet Whye Jr . have inaccurately represented gang- and drug-related activities in our neighborhood . Law-abiding citizens , working with police and other city officials , have tried to stop the violence and illegal activities by following recommended procedures . <p> After six years of consistent effort , the situation is essentially unchanged . Gang- and drug-related activities still put this neighborhood in danger . In fact , gang members have recruited younger relatives and neighborhood residents into illegal activities . Property owners and other adults in these houses participate in domestic violence , child neglect and alcohol and drug abuse . <p> Whye chose to portray one drug raid as yielding nothing more serious than cockroaches . What he omitted in his column was the fact that police were acting on a no-knock warrant . Neither the dogs nor the policemen could stand to remain in the house because of the stench from rotting food and cockroaches . He also did not mention that there were two small children in the house at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they notify Health and Hospitals or Social Services officials . Neighbors did call both agencies and continued to call them for several weeks , but nothing was done about the situation . <p> Neighbors have pursued these efforts at great personal risk . Many will not speak to reporters or attend meetings because of the threat of retaliation . <p> It is disturbing that Chet Whye Jr . chose to use inaccurate information . He made several important errors . For example , the dates and the sequence of events were wrong . He placed the two Crenshaw Mafia Ganger members incorrectly . One actually resides in Los Angeles and the other lived two blocks down the street from the location he cited . <p> Whye also reported that no calls to a recorded message hot line in four months was evidence that nothing illegal is happening on the block . Neighbors have called police concerning events on these properties in the last four months , but they called different numbers . They dialed 911 or District 2 police phone numbers to report crime and suspected drug deals . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Neighbors continue in our efforts to build a safe community ; we need the support and accurate reporting of the media . <p> GINGER PERKINS and <p> TOM BURKE , Co-Chairs <p> Greater Park Hill Community Inc . <p> 30 years ago , Supreme Court unlocked the chains <p> keeping contraception away from U.S. families <p> These days , it has become common in some political circles to speak longingly for a return to an era long past . Instead , today we should celebrate just how far we have come . Just 30 years ago , June 7 , 1965 , the U.S. Supreme Court recognized what Justice William Douglas referred to as a " right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights " - the right for married women and men to plan their families and use contraceptives . <p> It is difficult to imagine a world before Griswold vs . Connecticut , the landmark ruling that struck down laws in 29 states that branded contraception " lewd and lascivious " and illegal . Married couples found guilty of using contraceptives faced 60 days in jail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning , spacing and caring properly for their children because of outdated " obscenity laws . " Health care professionals like Estelle Griswold , executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut , were imprisoned for providing contraceptive information and services to women and their families . Even after the Griswold decision , it would be another seven years before the right to use contraception would be extended to unmarried couples . <p> The tremendous positive impact of access to contraception can not be understated : <p> In 1965 , two out of three children born to American women were unplanned , either mistimed ( 45 percent ) or unwanted altogether ( 20 percent . ) Those figures have fallen dramatically , with mistimed births dropping to 28 percent and unwanted births falling to 12 percent . <p> The freedom to defer or limit childbearing has enabled women to take the first steps toward joining men as equals in the workplace . In 30 years , the number of women in the workplace has more than doubled ; today nearly 60 percent of all women work outside the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has plummeted . In 1965 , 243.7 infants under 1 year of age died per 1,000 live births ; today that figure has declined to 8.5 infants per 1,000 live births . <p> Griswold opened the doors to the development of new and more effective contraceptive methods . Today , nearly 35 million U.S. women use some form of contraceptive . <p> But while today most Americans take contraceptive information and services for granted , our privacy rights are again under attack by far-right groups claiming to speak for " morality " in America ; groups that seek to deny women access to contraceptives . Thirty short years after the Griswold decision , leaders on Capitol Hill , in conjunction with powerful far-right special-interest groups , are trying to eradicate public family planning programs for the women who need them most - the poor , the undereducated and the underinsured . Title X of the Public Health Service Act , signed by then-President Nixon , provides desperately needed information about all forms of contraception , including abstinence . And it provides access to a range of contraceptive services that prevent nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Public family planning programs have also succeeded in helping low-income women prevent or delay childbearing so they can gain the education and job skills they need to take control of their own lives and the lives of their families . But public family planning is under attack by groups like the Christian Coalition that want to turn the clock back 30 years on American women and their families , erasing those hard-won gains . <p> Even here in Colorado , family planning is under attack . Recently , Rep. Penn Pfiffner , R-Lakewood , and 14 other state legislators voted to eliminate all family planning money from the state 's budget . Had this outrageous anti-family planning vote passed , public health clinics and other health providers would have been unable to provide comprehensive reproductive health care , including cervical and breast cancer screenings , for low-income women around the state . <p> Today , American couples recognize the importance of planning families , and firmly believe that each of us has a right and a need to decide when and whether to have children . Family planning services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving them the attention and resources they need to grow and flourish . <p> There is no more sight-sighted effort than denying those same opportunities for the most needy . In strictly economic terms , the savings are remarkable : Last year , for every public dollar spent on family planning , taxpayers saved $ 4.40 in social welfare costs - a total savings of $ 1.8 billion . <p> So , today , 30 years after the historic Griswold decision , we can reflect with pride on how much we have accomplished . Children are healthier , women have made great strides toward self-empowerment and an equal footing in society , and our nation reaps the benefits of both . But we must not wipe those gains away to accommodate the agenda of the far right . <p> For the sake of our families and the future of the American family , we must not go back . <p> SYLVIA CLARK <p> Executive Director <p> Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains <p> Fathers are necessary ; abortions are n't <p> Most of what Dottie Lamm said ( June 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark . Her implication is that a father is n't a luxury , but a necessity . Bingo . <p> However , Lamm 's suggestion of state-funded abortions is a grave mistake , and there are two very compelling reasons why this is so . <p> First , the absence of many fathers is nothing more than failure to take responsibility . The inability of many to accept the consequences of their actions is the root of today 's evils . <p> Responsibility extends into our sex lives . Lamm is totally correct in saying that abstinence should be taught . Yet , people engaging in illicit sex must be taught to take responsibility for all its consequences , including a child being born . <p> Yes , let 's do anything we can to bring deadbeat fathers to account or get absent ones to take a more active role . Simultaneously , let 's teach our kids about responsibility and model it in our homes or through a mentoring program such as Big Brothers . Or send your favorite no-account dad to an event like Promise Keepers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the line at murdering the innocent , helpless babies . <p> SUSAN E. KOLMER <p> Arvada <p> ' Moment of silence ' <p> was fatuous pap <p> I am unable to shake my discomfort and disbelief at the recent University of Colorado at Denver graduation ceremony where the master of ceremonies asked the audience to " take a moment of silence and contemplate the goodness of humankind . " <p> If this worship of the creature ( humankind ) as a substitute for a prayer to God becomes generally acceptable in our society , then I fear for the future goodness of humankind . <p> STEVE BROWN <p> Parker <p> U.S. must develop <p> alternative and renewable <p> energy sources <p> The third and fourth installments of Stephen Bowman 's special report ( Denver Post , May 29-30 ) described the vulnerability of the U.S. electrical grid to terrorism and offered decentralization using small-scale solar and wind power as the best protection . In addition to increased security for America , renewable energy sources such as solar and wind have many other advantages . <p> The vast majority of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . A recent poll ( December 1994 ) conducted by Vincent Breglio ( the former director of polling for the Reagan/Bush and Bush/Quayle campaigns ) indicated that three-quarters of Americans believe federal research spending should be redirected from fossil fuels or nuclear to energy efficiency or renewables . While logic and the wishes of the American people call for increased funding of renewable energy sources , our current Congress is instead trying to cut funding drastically . <p> There is a basic conflict : on one side are the best interests and wishes of the American people , and on the other are the current Congress and the oil company campaign contributions . <p> DOUG ROSE <p> Golden <p> Democrats back off from <p> balanced-budget rhetoric <p> For years the Democratic Party has been harping about the dangers of an unbalanced budget and how profligate the Reagan/Bush years were . The Republicans , who finally are a majority in Congress , are being true to their word by proposing a fiscally responsible , but compassionate balanced budget . Now the Democrats are hedging . <p> They claim that college students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the elderly wo n't get medical care , etc . But our country is wealthier than ever before - including students . The Republicans are not proposing overall cuts , but reductions in the rate of growth of government spending . A growing economy will eventually balance the budget . <p> Sometimes I wonder if much of the Democratic Party is about pursuing something for nothing . If I am wrong , then why not have a voluntary tax ( " voltax " ) ? We can have a balanced budget with limited government spending , and all those generous souls who want to see more money spent can voluntarily give the IRS more of their own money . Perhaps some families would like to directly sponsor the needs of other families by being billed directly for their expenses ? <p> MARK MILLER <p> Boulder <p> Jefferson County Center <p> is an innovative effort <p> to help troubled kids <p> Your article ( May 29 ) entitled : " Center to help kids in trouble " was most enlightening and encouraging . <p> Most of us realize that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into criminals . But the question , of course , is what ? Perhaps Jefferson County has created , at the least , an initial solution . The county is to be congratulated and encouraged for its honest and thoughtful actions in creating and funding the Juvenile Assessment Center . None of us can expect miracles from any particular program - the problem is far too complex - but we should all observe and support this innovative attempt . <p> I hope that The Post will keep a close eye on this bold effort , and keep the citizenry advised of developments . Who knows , the county may be developing a program that can be a model for the entire country . The county must not be discouraged by a few failures , here and there . The overall results and trend are what will count . <p> CHARLES E. HARRIS <p> Colorado Springs
