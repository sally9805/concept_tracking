The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle Part One Just before dusk in the late afternoon of June 16 , 1832 , 1 found myself walking along the crowded docks of Liverpool , England , following a man by the name of Grummage . Though a business associate of my father , Mr. Grummage was , like my father , a gentleman . It was he my father delegated to make the final arrangements for my passage to America . He was also to meet me when I came down from school on the coach , then see me safely stowed aboard the ship that my father had previously selected . Mr. Grummage was dressed in a black frock coat with a stove pipe hat that added to his considerable height . His somber , sallow face registered no emotion . His eyes might have been those of a dead fish . " Miss Doyle ? " he said as I stepped from the Liverpool coach . " Yes , sit . Are you Mr. Grummage ? " " I am . " " Pleased to meet you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he returned . " Now , Miss Doyle , if you would be so good as to indicate which is your trunk , I have a man here to carry it . Next , please oblige me by following , and everything shall be as it is meant to be . " " Might I say good-bye to my chaperon ? " " Is that necessary ? " " She 's been very kind . " " Make haste then . " In a flutter of nervousness I identified my trunk , threw my arms about Miss Emerson ( my sweet companion for the trip down ) , and bid her a tearful farewell . Then I rushed after Mr. Grummage , who had already begun to move on . A rough-looking porter , laboring behind , carried my trunk upon his back . Our little parade reached dockside in good order . There I became instantly agog at the mass of ships that lay before us , masts and spars thick as the bristles on a brush . Everywhere I looked I saw mountains of rare goods piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea ! A parrot ! A monkey ! Oh yes , the smell of the sea was intoxicating to one who knew little more than the smell of the trim cut lawns and the fields of the Barrington School . Then too , the surging crowds of workers , sailors , and merchants-all rough-hewn , brawny men -- created an exotic late afternoon hubbub . All in all it was a most delicious chaos , which , while mildly menacing , was no less exciting because of that . Indeed , in some vague way I had the feeling that it was all there for me . " Mr. Grummage , sit , " I called over the din . " What is the name of the ship I 'm to sail on ? " Mr. Grummage paused briefly to look at me as though surprised I was there , to say nothing of asking a question . Then from one of his pockets he drew a screw of paper . Squinting at it he pronounced , " The Seahawk . " " Is she British or American ? " " American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . " " How many masts ? " " I do n't know . " " Will the other families already be on board ? " " I should think so , " he answered , exasperation in his voice . " For your information , Miss Doyle , I received word that departure was being put off , but when I checked with the captain directly he informed me that there must have been some misunderstanding . The ship is scheduled to leave with the first tide tomorrow morning . So there can be no delay . " To prove the point he turned to move again . 1 , however , unable to quell my excited curiosity , managed to slip in one more question . " Mr , Grummage , sir , what is the captain 's name ? " Mr. Grummage stopped again , frowning in an irritated fashion , but all the same consulted his paper . " Captain Jaggery , " he announced and once more turned to go . " Here ! " the porter exclaimed suddenly . He had come up close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked about . " Did you say Captain Jaggery ? " the porter demanded . " Are you addressing me ? " Mr. Grummage inquired , making it perfectly clear that if so , the porter had committed a serious breach of decorum . " I was , " the man said , talking over my head . " And I 'm asking if I heard right when you said we was going to a ship mastered by a certain Captain Jaggery . " He spoke the name Jaggery as if it were something positively loathsome . " I was not addressing you , " Mr. Grummage informed the man . " But I hears you all the same , " the porter went on , and so saying , he swung my trunk down upon the dock with such a ferocious crack that I feared it would snap in two . " I do n't intend to take one more step toward anything to do with a Mr. Jaggery . Not for double gold . Not one more step . " " See here , " Mr. Grummage cried with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I undertook , " the man retorted . " It 's worth more to me to avoid that man than to close with your coin . " And without other word he marched off . " Stop ! I say , stop ! " Mr. Grummage called . It was in vain . The porter had gone , and quickly at that . Mr. Grummage and I looked at each other . I hardly knew what to make of it . Nor , clearly , did he . Yet he did what he had to do : he surveyed the area in search of a replacement . " There ! You man ! " he cried to the first who passed by , a huge laboring fellow in a smock . " Here 's a shilling if you can carry this young lady 's trunk ! " The man paused , looked at Mr. Grummage , at me , at the trunk . " That ? " he asked disdainfully . " I 'll be happy to add a second shilling , " I volunteered , thinking that a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Grummage snapped . " Let me handle this . " " Two shillings , " the workman said quickly . " One , " Mr. Grummage countered . " Two , " the workman repeated and held his hand out to Mr. Grummage , who gave him but one coin . Then the man turned and extended his hand to me . Hastily I began to extract a coin from my reticule . " Miss Doyle ! " Mr. Grummage objected .
