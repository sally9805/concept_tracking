Momma once told me that she and Daddy named me Dawn because I was born at the break of day . That was the first of a thousand lies Momma and Daddy would tell me and my brother Jimmy . Of course , we would n't know they were lies , not for a long time , not until the day they came to take us away . Chapter 1 : Another New Place The sound of dresser drawers being opened and closed woke me . I heard Momma and Daddy whispering in their room , and my heart began to thump fast and hard . I pressed my palm against my chest , took a deep breath , and turned to wake Jimmy , but he was already sitting up in our sofa bed . Bathed in the silvery moonlight that came pouring through our bare window , my sixteen-year-old brother 's face looked chiseled from granite . He sat there so still , listening . I lay there listening with him , listening to the hateful wind whistle through the cracks and crannies of this small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , rundown town just outside of Washington , D.C. We had been here barely four months . " What is it , Jimmy ? What 's going on ? " I asked , shivering partly from the cold and partly because deep inside I knew the answer . Jimmy fell back against his pillow and then brought his hands behind his head . In a sulk , he stared up at the dark ceiling . The pace of Momma 's and Daddy 's movements became more frenzied . " We were gon na get a puppy here , " Jimmy mumbled . " And this spring Momma and I were gon na plant a garden and grow our own vegetables . " I could feel his frustration and anger like heat from an iron radiator . " What happened ? " I asked mournfully , for I , too , had high hopes . " Daddy came home later than usual , " he said , a prophetic note of doom in his voice . " He rushed in here , his eyes wild . You know , bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and not long after , they started packing ... Might as well get up and get dressed , " Jimmy said , throwing the blanket off him and turning to sit up . " They 'll be out here shortly tellin ' us to do it anyway . " I groaned . Not again , and not again in the middle of the night . Jimmy leaned over to turn on the lamp by our pull-out bed and started to put on his socks so he would n't have to step down on a cold floor . He was so depressed , he did n't even worry about getting dressed in front of me . I fell back and watched him unfold his pants so he could slip into them , moving with a quiet resignation that made everything around me seem more like a dream . How I wished it were . I was fourteen years old , and for as long as I could remember , we had been packing and unpacking , going from one place to another . It always seemed that just when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new school and finally made some friends and I got to know my teachers , we had to leave . Maybe we really were no better than homeless gypsies like Jimmy always said , wanderers , poorer than the poorest , for even the poorest families had some place they could call home , some place they could return to when things went bad , a place where they had grandmas and grandpas or uncles and aunts to hug them and comfort them and make them feel good again . We would have settled even for cousins . At least , I would have . I peeled back the blanket , and my nightgown fell away and exposed most of my bosom . I glanced at Jimmy and caught him gazing at me in the moonlight . He shifted his eyes away quickly . Embarrassment made my heart pitterpatter , and I pressed my palm against the bodice of my nightgown . I had never told any of my girlfriends at school that Jimmy and I shared even a room together , much less this dilapidated pull-out bed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react , embarrassing both Jimmy and me even more . I brought my feet down on the freezing-cold bare wood floor . My teeth chattering , I embraced myself and hurried across the small room to gather up a blouse and a sweater and a pair of jeans . Then I went into the bathroom to dress . By the time I finished , Jimmy had his suitcase closed . It seemed we always left something else behind each time . There was only so much room in Daddy 's old car anyway . I folded my nightgown and put it neatly into my own suitcase . The clasps were as hard as ever to close and Jimmy had to help . Momma and Daddy 's bedroom door opened and they came out , their suitcases in hand , too . We stood there facing them , holding our own . " Why do we have to leave in the middle of the night again ? " I asked , looking at Daddy and wondering if leaving would make him angry as it so often did . " Best time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a quick order not to ask too many questions . Jimmy was right  --  Daddy had that wild look again , a look that seemed so unnatural , it sent shivers up and down my spine . I hated it when Daddy got that look . He was a handsome man with rugged features , a cap of sleek brown hair and dark coal eyes . When the day came that I fell in love and decided to marry , I hoped my husband would be just as handsome as Daddy . But I hated it when Daddy was displeased  --  when he got that wild look . It marred his handsome features and made him ugly  --  something I could n't bear to see . " Jimmy , take the suitcases down . Dawn , you help your momma pack up whatever she wants from the kitchen . " I glanced at Jimmy . He was only two years older than I was , but there was a wider gap in our looks . He was tall and lean and muscular like Daddy . I was small with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did n't take after Momma , either , because she was as tall as Daddy . She told me she was gangly and awkward when she was my age and looked more like a boy until she was thirteen , when she suddenly blossomed . We did n't have many pictures of family . Matter of fact , all I had was one picture of Momma when she was fifteen . I would sit for hours gazing into her young face , searching for signs of myself . She was smiling in the picture and standing under a weeping willow tree . She wore an ankle-length straight skirt and a fluffy blouse with frilly sleeves and a frilly collar . Her long , dark hair looked soft and fresh . Even in this old black and white photo , her eyes sparkled with hope and love . Daddy said he 'd taken the picture with a small box camera he had bought for a quarter from a friend of his . He was n't sure it would work , but at least this picture came out . If we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost or left behind during our many moves . However , I thought that even in this simple old photograph with its black and white fading into sepia and its edges fraying , Momma looked so pretty that it was easy to see why Daddy had lost his heart to her so quickly even though she was only fifteen at the time . She was barefoot in the picture , and I thought she looked fresh and innocent and as lovely as anything else nature had to offer . Momma and Jimmy had the same shimmering black hair and dark eyes . They both had bronze complexions with beautiful white teeth that allowed them ivory smiles . Daddy had dark brown hair , but mine was blond . And I had freckles over the tops of my cheeks . No one else in my family had freckles . " What about that rake and shovel we bought for the garden ? " Jimmy asked , careful not to let even a twinkle of hope show in his eyes . " We ai n't got the room , " Daddy snapped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born all crunched up as tightly as a fist , his eyes sewn shut . She said she gave birth to Jimmy on a farm in Maryland . They had just arrived there and gone knocking on the door , hoping to find some work , when her labor began . They told me I had been born on the road , too . They had hoped to have me born in a hospital , but they were forced to leave one town and start out for another where Daddy had already secured new employment . They left late in the afternoon one day and traveled all that day and that night . " We were between nowhere and no place , and all of a sudden you wanted to come into this world , " Momma told me . " Your daddy pulled the truck over and said , ' Here we go again , Sally Jean . ' I crawled onto the truck bed where we had an old mattress , and as the sun came up , you entered this world . I remember how the birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were coming into this world , Dawn . That 's why you sing so pretty , " Momma said . " Your grandmomma always said whatever a woman looked at just before , during , or right after giving birth , that 's what characteristics the child would have . The worst thing was to have a mouse or a rat in the house when a woman was pregnant . " " What would happen , Momma ? " I asked , filled with wonder . " The child would be sneaky , cowardly . " I sat back amazed when she told me all this . Momma had inherited so much wisdom . It made me wonder and wonder about our family , a family we had never seen . I wanted to know so much more , but it was difficult to get Momma and Daddy to talk about their early lives . I suppose that was because so much of it was painful and hard . We knew they were both brought up on small farms in Georgia , where their people eked out poor livings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big families that lived in rundown farmhouses . There just was n't any room in either household for a newly married , very young couple with a pregnant wife , so they began what would be our family 's history of traveling , traveling that had not yet ended . We were on our way again . Momma and I filled a carton with those kitchenwares she wanted to take along and then gave it to Daddy to load in the car . When she was finished , she put her arm around my shoulders , and we both took one last look at the humble little kitchen . Jimmy was standing in the doorway , watching . His eyes turned from pools of sadness to coal-black pools of anger when Daddy came in to hurry us along . Jimmy blamed him for our gypsy life . I wondered sometimes if maybe he was n't right . Often Daddy seemed different from other men  --  more fidgety , more nervous . I would never say it , but I hated it whenever he stopped off at a bar on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sulk and stand by the windows watching as if he were expecting something terrible . None of us could talk to him when he was in one of those moods . He was like that now . " Better get going , " he said , standing in the doorway , his eyes turning even colder as they rested for a second on me . For a moment I was stunned . Why had Daddy given me such a cold took ? It was almost as if he blamed me for our having to leave . As soon as the thought entered my mind , I chased it away . I was being silly ! Daddy would never blame me for anything . He loved me . He was just mad because Momma and I were being so slow and dawdling , instead of hurrying out the door . As if reading my mind , Momma suddenly spoke . " Right , " she said quickly . Momma and I started for the door , for we had all learned from hard experience that Daddy was unpredictable when his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to invoke his wrath . We turned back once and then closed the door behind us , just like we had closed dozens of doors before . There were few stars out . I did n't like nights without stars . On those nights shadows seemed so much darker and longer to me . Tonight was one of those nights  --  cold , dark , All the windows in houses around us black . The wind carried a piece of paper through the street , and off in the distance a dog howled . Then I heard a siren . Somewhere in the night someone was in trouble , I thought , some poor person was being carried off to the hospital , or maybe the police were chasing a criminal . " Let 's move along , " Daddy ordered and sped up as if they were chasing us . Jimmy and I squeezed ourselves into the backseat with our cartons and suitcases . " Where we going this time ? " Jimmy demanded without disguising his displeasure . " Richmond , " Momma said . " Richmond ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , it seemed , but Richmond . " Yep . Your daddy 's got a job in a garage there , and I 'm sure I can land me a chambermaid job in one of the motels . " " Richmond , " Jimmy muttered under his breath . Big cities still frightened both of us . As we drove away from Granville and the darkness fell around us , our sleepiness returned . Jimmy and I closed our eyes and fell asleep against each other as we had done so many times before . Daddy had been planning our new move for a little while because he had already found us a place to live . Daddy often did things quietly and then announced them to us . Because the rents in the city were so much higher , we could afford only a one-bedroom apartment , so Jimmy and I still had to share a room . And the sofa bed ! It was barely big enough for the two of us . I knew sometimes he awoke before me but did n't move because my arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and embarrass me about it . And there were those times he touched me accidentally where he was n't supposed to . The blood would rush to his face , and he would leap off the bed as if it had started to burn . He would n't say anything to acknowledge he had touched me , and I would n't mention it . It was usually like that . Jimmy and I simply ignored things that would embarrass other teenage boys and girls forced to live in such close quarters , but I could n't help sitting by and dreaming longingly for the same wonderful privacy most of my girlfriends enjoyed , especially when they described how they could close their doors and gossip on their own phones or write love notes without anyone in their families knowing a thing about it . I was even afraid to keep a diary because everyone would be looking over my shoulder . This apartment differed little from most of our previous homes  --  the same small rooms , peeling wallpaper , and chipped paint . The same windows that did n't close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he would rather sleep in the street . But just when we thought things were as bad as they could be , they got worse . Late one afternoon months after we had moved to Richmond , Momma came home from work much earlier than usual . I had been hoping she would bring something else for us to have for dinner . We were at the tail end of the week , Daddy 's payday , and most of our money from the previous week was gone . We had been able to have one or two good meals during the week , but now we were eating leftovers . My stomach was rumbling just as much as Jimmy 's was , but before either of us could complain , the door opened and we both turned , surprised to see Momma come in . She stopped , shook her head , and started to cry . Then she hurried across the room to her bedroom . " Momma ! What 's wrong ? " I called after her , but her only answer was to slam the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us frightened . I went to her door and knocked softly . " Momma ? " Jimmy came up beside me and waited . " Momma , can we come in ? " I opened the door and looked inside . She was facedown on the bed , her shoulders shaking . We entered slowly , Jimmy right beside me . I sat down on the bed and put my hand on her shoulder . " Momma ? " Finally she stopped sobbing and turned to look up at us . " Did you lose your job , Momma ? " Jimmy asked quickly . " No , it 's not that , Jimmy . " She sat up , grinding her small fists against her eyes to wipe the tears away . " Although I wo n't be havin ' the job all that much longer . " " Then what is it , Momma ? Tell us , " I begged . She sniffed and pushed back her hair and took each of our hands into hers . " You 're gon na have either a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart paused . Jimmy 's eyes widened and his mouth dropped open . " It 's my fault . I just ignored and ignored the signs . I never thought I was pregnant , because I did n't have no more children after Dawn . I finally went to a doctor today and found out I was a little more n ' four months pregnant . Suddenly I 'm gon na have a child , and now I wo n't be able to work , too , " she said and began to cry again . " Oh , Momma , do n't cry . " The thought of another mouth to feed dropped a black shadow over my heart . How could we manage it ? We did n't have enough as it was . I looked to Jimmy to urge him to say something comforting , but he looked stunned and angry . He just stood there , staring . " Does Daddy know yet , Momma ? " he asked . " No , " she said . She took a deep breath . " I 'm too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered and shook her head . " You 're mad at me , ain'tcha , Jimmy ? " Momma asked him . He was so sullen , I wanted to kick him . Finally he shook his head . " Naw , Momma , I ai n't mad at you . It 's not your fault . " He swung his eyes at me , and I knew he was blaming Daddy . " Then give me a hug . I need one right now . " Jimmy looked away and then leaned toward Momma . He gave her a quick hug , mumbled something about having to get something outside , and then hurried out . " You just lay back and rest , Momma , " I said . " I almost have the dinner all made anyway . " " Dinner . What do we have to eat ? I was going to try to pick up something tonight , see if we could charge any more on our grocery bill , but with this pregnancy and all , I clean forgot about eating . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy gets paid today , so tomorrow we 'll eat better . " " I 'm sorry , Dawn , " she said , her face wrinkling up in preparation for her sobs again . She shook her head . " Jimmy 's so mad . I can see it in his eyes . He 's got Ormand 's temper . " " He 's just surprised , Momma . I 'll see about dinner , " I repeated and went out and closed the door softly behind me , my fingers trembling on the knob . A baby , a little brother or sister ! Where would a baby sleep ? How could Momma take care of a baby ? If she could n't work , we would have even less money . Did n't grown-ups plan these things ? How could they let it happen ? I went outside to look for Jimmy and found him throwing a rubber ball against the wall in the alley . It was mid April , so the chill was out of the air , even in the early evening . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . The neon lights above the doorway of Frankie 's Bar and Grill at the corner had been turned on . Sometimes , on his way home on a hot day , Daddy would stop in there for a cold beer . When the door was opened and closed , the laughter and the music from the jukebox spilled out and then died quickly on the sidewalk , a sidewalk always dirtied with papers and candy wrappers and other refuse that the wind lifted out of overflowing garbage cans . I could hear two cats in heat threaten each other in an alleyway . A man was shouting curses up at another man , who leaned out a two-story window about a block south of us . The man in the window just laughed down at him . I turned to Jimmy . He was as tight as a fist again , and he was heaving all his anger with each and every throw of the ball . " Jimmy ? " He did n't answer me . " Jimmy , you do n't want to make Momma feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked him softly . He seized the ball in the air and turned on me . " What 's the use of pretending , Dawn ? One thing we definitely do n't need right now is another child in the house . Look at what we 're eating for dinner tonight ! " I swallowed hard . His words were like cold rain falling on a warm campfire . " We do n't even have hand-me-downs to give to a new baby , " he continued . " We 're gon na have to buy baby clothes and diapers and a crib . And babies need all sorts of lotions and creams , do n't they ? " " They do , but  --  " " Well , why did n't Daddy think of that , huh ? He 's off whistlin ' and jawin ' with those friends of his who hang around the garage , just as if he 's on top of the world , and now here 's this , " he said , gesturing toward our building . Why had n't Daddy thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going all the way and becoming pregnant , but that was because they were just girls and did n't know better . " It just happened , I guess , " I said , fishing for Jimmy to give his opinion . " It does n't just happen , Dawn . A woman does n't wake up one morning and find out she 's pregnant . " " Do n't the parents plan to have it ? " He looked at me and shook his head . " Daddy probably came home drunk one night and ... " " And what ? " " Oh , Dawn ... they made the baby , that 's all . " " And did n't know they had ? " " Well , they do n't always make a baby each time , they ... " He shook his head . " You 'll have to ask Momma about it . I do n't know all the details , " he said quickly , but I knew he did . " It 's going to be hell to pay when Daddy gets home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we walked back inside . He spoke in a voice just above a whisper and gave me a fearful chill . My heart pounded in anticipation . Most of the time when trouble came raining down over us , Daddy would decide we had to pack up and run , but we could n't run from this . Because I always cooked dinner , I knew better than anyone that we did n't have anything to spare for a baby . Not a cent , not a crumb . When Daddy arrived home from work that night , he looked a lot more tired than usual and his hands and arms were all greasy . " I had to pull out a car transmission and rebuild it in one day , " he explained , thinking the way he looked was why Jimmy and I were staring at him so strangely . " Somethin ' wrong ? " " Ormand , " Momma called . Daddy hurried into the bedroom . I busied myself with the dinner , but my heart started to pound so hard I could barely breathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north side of the street and stood staring as still as a statue . We heard Momma crying again . After a while it grew quiet and then Daddy emerged . Jimmy pivoted expectantly . " Well , now , you two already know , I reckon . " He shook his head and looked back at the closed door behind him . " How we gon na manage ? " Jimmy asked quickly . " I do n't know , " Daddy said , his eyes darkening . His face began to take on that mad look , his lips curling in at the corners , some whiteness of his teeth flashing through . He ran his fingers through his hair and sucked in some breath . Jimmy flopped down in a kitchen chair . " Other people plan kids , " he muttered . Daddy 's face flared . I could n't believe he had said it . He knew Daddy 's temper , but I recalled what Momma said : Jimmy had the same temper . Sometimes they were like two bulls with a red flag between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed for the door . " Where 're you going , Daddy ? " I called . " I need to think , " he said . " Eat without me . " Jimmy and I listened to Daddy 's feet pound the hallway floor , his steps announcing the anger and turmoil in his body . " Eat without him , he says , " Jimmy quipped . " Grits and black-eyed peas . " " He 's going to Frankie 's , " I predicted . Jimmy nodded in agreement and sat back , staring glumly at his plate . " Where 's Ormand ? " Momma asked , stepping out of her bedroom . " He went off to think , Momma , " Jimmy said . " He 's probably just trying to come up with a plan and needs to be alone , " he added , hoping to ease her burden . " I do n't like him going off like that , " Momma complained . " it never comes to no good . You should go look for him , Jimmy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , Momma . He do n't like it when I do that . Let 's just eat and wait for him to come back . " Momma was n't happy about it , but she sat down and I served the grits and black-eyed peas . I had added some salt and a little bit of bacon grease I had saved . " I 'm sorry I did n't try to get us something else , " Mommy said , apologizing again . " But Dawn , honey , you did real fine with this . It tastes good . Do n't it , Jimmy ? " He looked up from his bowl . I saw he had n't been listening . Jimmy could get lost in his own thoughts for hours and hours if no one pestered him , especially when he was unhappy . " Huh ? Oh . Yeah , this is good . " After supper Momma sat up for a while listening to the radio and reading one of the used magazines she had brought back from the motel she worked in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slam or the sound of footsteps , we anticipated Daddy coming through the door , but it grew later and later and he did n't reappear . Whenever I gazed at Momma , I saw that sadness draped her face like a wet flag , heavy and hard to shake off . Finally she stood up and announced she had to go to bed . She took a deep breath , holding her hands against her chest , and headed for her bedroom . " I 'm tired too , " Jimmy said . He got up and went to the bathroom to get ready for bed . I started to pull out the sofa bed , but then stopped , thinking about Momma lying in her bed , worried and frightened . In a moment I made up my mind  --  I opened the door quietly and left to look for Daddy . I hesitated outside the door of Frankie 's Bar and Grill . I had never been in a bar . My hand trembled as I reached out for the doorknob , but before I could pull it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much lipstick and rouge on her face stepped out . She had a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth . She paused when she saw me and smiled . I saw she had teeth missing toward the back of her mouth . " Why , what you doing coming in here , honey ? This ai n't no place for someone as young as you . " " I 'm looking for Ormand Longchamp , " I replied . " Never heard of him , " she said . " You do n't stay in there long , honey . It ai n't a place for kids , " she added and walked past me , the stale odor of cigarettes and beer floating in her wake . I watched her for a moment and then entered Frankie 's . I had seen into it once in a while whenever someone opened the door , and I knew there was a long bar on the right with mirrors and shelves covered with liquor bottles . I saw the fans in the ceiling and the sawdust on the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables to the left . A couple of men at the end of the bar turned my way when I stepped in . One smiled , the other just stared . The bartender , a short stout bald-headed man , was leaning against the wall . He had his arms folded across his chest . " What do you want ? " he asked , coming down the bar . " I 'm looking for Ormand Longchamp , " I said . " I thought he might be in here . " A glance down the bar did n't produce him . " He joined the army , " someone quipped . " Shut up , " the bartender snapped . Then he turned back to me . " He 's over there , " he said and gestured with his head toward the tables on the left . I looked and saw Daddy slumped over a table , but I was afraid to walk farther into the bar and grill . " You can wake him up and take him home , " the bartender advised . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were the evening 's entertainment . " Let her be , " the bartender commanded . I walked between the tables until I reached Daddy . He had his head on his arms . There were five empty bottles of beer on the table and another nearly emptied . A glass with just a little beer in it was in front of the bottle . " Daddy , " I said softly . He did n't budge . I looked back at the bar and saw that even the men who had continued to watch me had lost interest . " Daddy , " I repeated a little louder . He stirred , but did n't lift his head . I poked him gently on the arm . " Daddy . " He grunted and then slowly lifted his head . " What ? " " Daddy , please come home now , " I said . He wiped his eyes and gazed at me . " What ... What are you doing here , Dawn ? " he asked quickly . " Momma went to bed a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake waiting for you , Daddy . " " You should n't come in a place like this , " he said sharply , making me jump . " I did n't want to come , Daddy , but  --  " " All right , all right , " he said . " I guess I ca n't do nothing right these days , " he added , shaking his head . " Just come home , Daddy . Everything will be all right . " " Yeah , yeah , " he said . He gazed at his beer a moment and then pushed back from the table . " Let 's get you outta here . You should n't be here , " he repeated . He started to stand and then sat down hard . He looked down at the bottles of beer again and then put his hand in his pocket and took out his billfold . He counted it quickly and shook his head . " Lost track of what I spent , " he said , more to himself than to me , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back . " How much did you spend , Daddy ? " " Too much , " he moaned . " Afraid we wo n't be eating all that well this week , either , " he concluded . He pushed himself away from the table again and stood up . " Come on , " he said . Daddy did n't walk straight until we reached the door . " Sleep tight ! " one of the men at the bar called . Daddy did n't acknowledge him . He opened the door and we stepped out . I was never so happy to confront fresh air again . The musty smell of the bar had turned my stomach . Why would Daddy even want to walk in there , much less spend time there ? I wondered . Daddy appreciated the fresh air , too , and took some deep breaths . " I do n't like you going in a place like that , " he said , walking . He stopped suddenly and looked at me , shaking his head . " You 're smarter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve better . " " I 'm not better than anybody else , Daddy , " I protested , but he had said all he was going to , and we continued to our apartment . When we opened the door , we found Jimmy already in the pull-out bed , the covers drawn so high , they nearly covered his face . He did n't turn our way . Daddy went right to his bedroom , and I crawled under the covers with Jimmy , who stirred . " You went to Frankie 's and got him ? " he asked in a whisper . " Yes . " " If I had been the one , he 'd be furious , " he said . " No , he would n't , Jimmy , he 'd ... " I stopped because we heard Momma moan . Then we heard what sounded like Daddy laughing . A moment later there was the distinct sound of the bedsprings . Jimmy and I knew what that meant . In our close quarters we had grown used to the sounds people often make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were younger , we did n't know what it meant , but when we learned , we pretended that we did n't hear it . Jimmy drew the blanket up toward his ears again , but I was confused and a bit fascinated . " Jimmy , " I whispered . " Go to sleep , Dawn , " he pleaded . " But , Jimmy , how can they  --  " " Just go to sleep , will you ? " " I mean , Momma 's pregnant . Can they still ... ? " Jimmy did n't respond . " Is n't it dangerous ? " Jimmy turned toward me abruptly . " Will you stop asking those kind of questions ? " " But I thought you might know . Boys usually know more than girls , " I said . " Well , I do n't know , " he replied . " Okay ? So shut up . " He turned his back to me again . It quieted down in Momma and Daddy 's room , but I could n't stop wondering . I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my questions . I was too embarrassed to ask Momma about these things because I did n't want her to think Jimmy and I were eavesdropping . My leg grazed Jimmy 's , and he pulled away as if I had burned him . Then he slid over to his end of the bed until he was nearly off . I shifted as far over to mine as I could , too . Then I closed my eyes and tried to think of other things . As I was falling asleep , I thought of that woman who had come to the bar door just as I was about to open it to enter . She was smiling down at me , her lips twisted and rubbery , her teeth yellow and the cigarette smoke twirling up and over her bloodshot eyes . I was so glad I had managed to get Daddy home .
