Mad as hell and ca n't take it anymore ? Come in from the ledge . Here 's how to control your temper without letting it control you I snap more often than a king-size bowl of Rice Krispies . <p> A day does n't pass that I do n't spew vitriol at my PC , kick some inanimate object , or curse a passing motorist or two . I 'm a knot of cynical mistrust , angry feelings , aggressive responses , and hostile attributions . And that 's on a good day . But I bet you are n't much different . When pressure builds , we all fly off the handle . Problem is , I fly off the handle more often than a cheap ax head . <p> Which is why I decided to take an anger-management seminar . I wanted to be able to control my anger , which in turn would make me a happier and more peaceful fellow . But more important , I hope anger management might keep me from dying before my time . <p> " Chronically angry men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by age 50 than their easygoing counterparts , " says Redford Williams , M.D. , director of behavioral research at Duke University Medical Center . The figure he quotes is from a survey ( conducted by Duke psychologist John Barefoot , Ph.D. ) of doctors and lawyers who had filled out a psychological test in the 1950s . Only 2 percent of the men surveyed who had scored low in hostility on this test died during the next 25 years . But nearly 14 percent of the men with high hostility scores on the test died by age 50 . These unfortunate men may have croaked because they smoked more , drank more , and ate like brazen magazine editors , but hostility still may have been the underlying cause of their early deaths . " Hostile men practice poor health habits , " Dr. Williams tells me as we stand in line for lamb stew at the Duke Nutrition Center cafeteria . " Not only do hostile men smoke and drink more , they eat 600 more calories on average per day than nonhostile men . " Which could explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> During Dr. Williams 's seminar  --  one he teaches with his wife in a humid conference room at the nutrition center  --  he describes at great length the bad things hostility does to the body . It weakens the immune system ( by making your hormones overactive ) and it puts the heart at risk ( by clogging your arteries ) . He piles on the graphs and citations , and it 's kind of frightening ( thanks in part to gratuitous slides of grainy New Yorker cartoons ) . " If life were a game of Russian roulette with a gun that has 100 chambers , a nonhostile guy might have only one or two chambers loaded , " he says . " But a hostile guy might have 15 or 20 . " I must have more lead than Ma Barker , I think to myself as he talks . <p> This is n't to say that all anger is , bad . " If there were no such thing as anger , " Dr. Williams says , " Rosa Parks would still be in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel anger , you could come over to my place , eat all my food , and pelt me with the empty cans  --  without consequence . And slowly , evolution would erase losers like me , as jerks like you would flourish . The world would become one big stag party ( with real stags ) . <p> The key , therefore , is not to eliminate anger , but to make it work for you . <p> " The truly cool dude is one who takes each situation as it comes and evaluates it rationally , " says Dr. Williams . At the seminar he reveals a simple method to do just that , culled from a new book called LifeSkills , which he and his wife , Virginia , wrote . The method boils down to assessing any angry situation by asking four questions : <p> ( 1 ) What are the facts ? <p> ( 2 ) Is this matter really important ? <p> ( 3 ) Is what I 'm thinking appropriate to the situation ? <p> ( 4 ) Can I modify this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After you 've established the facts , if you answer " no " to question two , three , or four , just walk away . Getting angry is n't worth it . Distract yourself by thinking of something else ( someone naked , perhaps bound ? ) . If you say " yes " to all three of these , ask yourself one more : Is taking action worth the trouble ? " Because you 've already reasoned through the problem , you now can respond coolly , " says Dr. Williams . Without snapping like Marlon Brando 's bungee cord . <p> Here I 've tried this technique on situations that tend to rile guys like us . Sometimes the methods work , sometimes they do n't . But it ca n't hurt to give ' em a try the next time you 're stuck ... ... IN THE SUPERMARKET EXPRESS LANE <p> THE FACTS : The bluehair in front of you has 17 items in a 10-items-or-less lane . She 's moving slowly and does n't care . SIDE NOTE : She smells like mothballs . IS THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting softer than the ABC fall lineup . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Yes , if you 're hurrying for a reason . But if you 're not , it is n't . Often we do n't differentiate the two . We just get mad . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? You could ram your cart into her ankles , but then AARP would be after you . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? Since you answered " no " to one question above , chill out . Dr. Williams suggests a calming technique . " Pretend the old woman lives solely to upset you , " he says . For example : " She obviously planned to thwart me . She mapped out my routine for months , then waited at the supermarket for the last 10 hours . It 's all part ufa conspiracy of the blue-haired militia to undermine my sanity . She may be packing heat . " POTENTIAL OUTCOME : By the time you 've created Granny 's double life , she 's gone and the checker has bagged your PopTarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty annoyance  --  which could have turned to uncontrollable fury and unspeakable bloodshed !  --  has dissipated . Not bad ! ... IN FRONT OF THE BONEHEAD ON HIGHWAY 78 <p> THE FACTS : You 're doing 7 miles over the limit , and some jerk is on your tail , flashing his lights . SIDE NOTE : You 're with the wife , who already thinks your driving is as unsettling as the idea of French-kissing Don Imus . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? Yes . The jerk is on your ass ! <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? C'm on , Mother Teresa would be pissed too ( if she were still alive , driving a teal Blazer , and listening to the Cramps ) . CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yes . <p> You can hit the brakes and watch from the rearview as he greets the guardrail and plummets to a fiery death . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? The groceries will certainly fall over . And who knows what homemade drug the guy is on ? There could be gunplay , knifeplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You pull into the next lane . The jerk flashes past . If driving is like bullfighting , you just got gored . But then your wife commends you on your self-control . Her hand rests on your thigh . You find a motel . ... ASSEMBLING THE " EASY TO ASSEMBLE " BARBECUE GRILL <p> THE FACTS : You purchased an unassembled grill at the Mega Mart . The directions blow , and you ca n't put it together . You ca n't put anything together . You are a failure , which makes you angry . IS THIS IMPORTANT ? You used your rent money to pay for it . So , yes . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? As a man  --  with l0 fingers , no less  --  you should be ashamed of yourself . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yes . You could read the instructions , if you knew Mandarin . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? Yes . Brainstorm . You could pay to have a guy at the store assemble it . Or , Dr. Williams suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great at putting stuff together . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : No parent would let a 12-year-old near your apartment . Return the grill , and spring for the fully assembled floor model . ... IN A MESSY HOUSE <p> THE FACTS : You get home from work . The better half is watching Springer . Catalogs , empty Fritos bags , and action figures litter the floor . You ask , " What did you do today ? " She shows you a hat made out of coupons . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? Yes . Could n't she have tackled one chore ? The fridge is clean , but only because she ate all the cold cuts . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Yes . You bring home the bacon . She could at least wait till you get home before eating it all . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yes . IS IT WORTH IT ? If marriage is a twoway street , her side needs paving . Dr. Williams suggests asserting yourself by using the S-to-1 strategy . Psychologist John Gottman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that among those with successful relationships , positive comments outnumber negative ones by five to one . So , after telling her that ( 1 ) she looks great , ( 2 ) she 's lost weight , ( 3 ) her meat loaf rules , ( 4 ) the drapes look splendid , and ( 5 ) the new throw rug is delightful , ask whether it 's possible that both of you could tidy the place up a little . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : ( 1 ) She feels better about herself , which inspires her to ( 2 ) get up and clean . ( 3 ) She then cooks you an amazing dinner . Or , ( 1 ) she sees right through this maneuver and ( 2 ) you get a mistress . ... WITH BAD SERVICE <p> THE FACTS : You ordered a beer more than 10 minutes ago . Have n't seen your waiter , " Timothy , " since . <p> SIDE NOTE : The waiter has a goatee and an attitude . <p> IS IT IMPORTANT ? Yes . You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wannabe Brad Pitt who thinks Deepak Chopra is deep . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Yes . After all , there 's beer involved . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yeah . But headbutting is illegal . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? Yes . But first , suggests Dr. Williams , try this empathy exercise : " Put yourself in the person 's situation , and pretend you 're him . " Try it now . " Is it busy today , t I 've got 50 tables and I 'm so tired . I was up all night memorizing my lines for the offBroadway all-nude production of Pippin , and then the cat ate my Zoloft ! I hope that nice man who ordered the beer understands that I 'm only doing my best ! God , I miss improv ! " <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : You feel better-until you see him chatting up some other waiter . Empathy is aborted . You assert . Beer inevitably arrives , with malice . You leave a lousy tip . You find that empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A COWARDLY E-MAIL <p> THE FACTS : Someone flames you because he 's too chicken to confront you in person or on the phone . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? Maybe . But why are you so angry ? <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Yes . You hate weasels and their weenie behaviors . But you knew this guy was a twit all along , so why should this cowardly missive come as any surprise ? " Realize that people who resort to such tactics do n't deserve to occupy space and time in your brain , " says Dr. Williams . He 's right , but then again , you 've allowed lesser things to occupy your brain ( like the theme song to Maude ) . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? You could confront him face-to-face , or respond with an equally incendiary e-mail , or park really close to his car door . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? No . You 'll just get yourself in trouble . If you continue to ruminate about this , Dr. Williams suggests yelling " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , run 2 miles or meditate ( not at the same time ) . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : You temporarily quell the angry thoughts . And later you speak to him privately . Or you give in to your ire , and respond with your own flame . It feels really good . For a while . Then the paranoia creeps in . What if he forwards your response to the boss ? You should have listened to Dr. Williams ( or done the park job ) . ... DEALING WITH AN ANNOYING GIRLFRIEND <p> THE FACTS : She calls you a cheapskate in front of all your friends . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? Yes . She 's called you a skinflint before . If you had a dollar for every time she called you cheap ... you 'd stuff them into your mattress . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Hey , you 're a generous guy ! <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yes . But it may get ugly ( you could bring up her toenail problem ) . <p> IS IT WORTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks without sex ? Dr. Williams offers this tip : " When she says ' something in public that upsets you , let it go . Later , ask her why she said it , and then let her talk . For 5 minutes . " This is key . Five minutes is a long time to talk uninterrupted . Inevitably , she 'll end up contradicting herself , or confessing to a string of unsolved murders . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : After 30 seconds , she changes the subject . You get her back on it . She runs out of steam , apologizes , and says she 'll never call you cheap again . Score one for self-help ! ... WITH AN ANNOYING CO-WORKER <p> THE FACTS : The co-worker invades your office , lips flapping like underwear hung out during Hurricane Andrew . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? Yes . Not another story about his cat 's urinary problems ! <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Yes . The story 's becoming graphic . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Sure , but he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're a busy guy , and you need to get back to the CoedsLove-Convicts Web site . But though most of us dread boring conversations , we 're too polite to end them . So we nod and smile , hoping the mouth will move on . Never does . Dr. Williams suggests this : When he stops to gather air , simply ask , " How can I help you ? " " You blunt the chitchat quickly , " says Dr. Williams . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : You say it before he even starts ; his face goes blank . He says , " Oh , nothing . " He leaves . Try this at home , too .... DEALING WITH A SLACKER COLLEAGUE <p> THE FACTS : Instead of doing his job , a coworker asks you to do it for him . He does this frequently , and even though you refuse , you end up doing it anyway . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? Yes . Someone should stamp Tootsie Roll Pop on your forehead , sucker . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the less time you have for naps . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yes : Put your foot down ( not on his face ) . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? Yes . Dr. Williams suggests that the next time the slacker comes calling , you simply say no . You say you 've done that ? Dr. Williams scoffs . " You think you say no , but you inevitably follow it up with reasons . " Saying " No " and saying " No , I 'm really busy , " are two different things . Offering reasons for your response gives the person a chance to change your mind . ( If you say " No , I 'm busy , " he might say , " I do n't need it for two weeks . " ) Saying simp y " No " moves the wiggle room . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : When you say no , he stares at you blankly . He asks , " Why not ? " You 're tempted to give a reason , but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He avoids you for the rest of the day . Cool . You never liked him anyway . ... WATCHING TELEVISION <p> THE FACTS : A network public-service announcement with some rehab vet from Friends tells you how you should read to your kids , be nice to your parents , and recycle , recycle , recycle . <p> IS IT IMPORTANT ? No , but it ticks you off . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? You hate it when drug-addled millionaires  --  whose entire real-life experiences could fit in a kiddie pool  --  tell you how to live . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? You could scream at the television . " Scream if you must , " says Dr. Williams , " but every time your anger soars , so do your blood pressure and adrenaline levels . " <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? No . But you scream at the television anyway . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : It feels good to vent . But your heart 's beating hard . Your throat 's sore . The neighbors call the cops ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have just switched channels . ... WITNESSING THE BREAKDOWN OF OUR SOCIAL FABRIC <p> THE FACTS : A man flaunts the law by blaring a Pantera tape on his boom box during a 2-hour bus ride . <p> SIDE NOTE : The man is 6 ' 5 " , he could bench-press the entire Louie Anderson fan club , and he 's mumbling something about the coming apocalypse . <p> IS THIS IMPORTANT ? If one person breaks the law , the whole town goes to hell . <p> IS WHAT YOU 'RE THINKING APPROPRIATE ? Yes . This is a bus ride , not the Headbanger 's Ball . <p> CAN YOU MODIFY THE SITUATION ? Yes . Ask him to turn off the music . Or employ one of Dr. Williams 's techniques , called positive stroking . " Lead off with a compliment , " he says . Something like , " I love your speed metal , but I need to catch up on some work . " <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? Thinking on this further , Dr. Williams realizes that although this technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) it probably wo n't work with a glassy-eyed bus passenger . " Who knows what a dude like that might do ! " he says . <p> POTENTIAL OUTCOME : You arrive in the city with a chip on your shoulder the size of Meat Loaf . You stew for hours , ruminating on everything you wish you had said or done . Here , Dr. Williams suggests enlisting an ally . " Work out a hand signal with your wife . Tell her that every time you start obsessing , you 'll give her the signal . That 's her cue to say , Stop ! ' or to try to get you to think of something else . " ( Maybe she 'll open the bathrobe ! ) METHODS FOR YOUR MADNESS 7 ways to chill out <p> DO YOU pop a cork more often than a wine steward ? Here 's how anger specialists suggest channeling your anger . IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT <p> It 's important to use a control technique before you 've lost control of the situation , according to Marc Bock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb blows up , " he says , " you ca n't get it back in the shell . " <p> SLOW DOWN . " When you 're angry , you 're physically aroused , " says Christopher Peterson , Ph.D. , psychology professor at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor . To corral the response , breathe through your nose . Inhale for four counts and exhale for four counts . Try doing a specific task , such as tensing and relaxing your muscles , says Philadelphia-area psychologist Cary Rothstein , Ph.D . Exercises like this can help distract you . <p> VENT . Just telling a sympathetic third party about your anger helps release tension . Rather than yelling at your boss , blow off steam to your understanding wife . Do n't keep it all to yourself . If your wife 's not sympathetic , tell your dog  --  he 'll listen . <p> LOOK FOR THE REAL CAUSE . " Check out your perception of what makes you angry , " says psychologist Carol Tavris , Ph.D. , author of Anger . ' The Misunderstood Emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's causing the conflict , Tavris says . Is the boss ignoring your major project because he wants to sabotage you , or because he has n't had time to read it and respond ? No need to demand a response ; just ask him if he 's had a chance to read it . <p> CHANGE THE TROPIC . Sometimes you can calm down by just thinking about where you 're most relaxed  --  your favorite fishing hole , the golf course , the Caribbean . AFTER THE MOMENT <p> WHACK AWAY . Bock suggests either beating a cardboard box with a stick or throwing old plates into a Dumpster . " It releases old angers , " he says . The best time to do it is when you 're feeling calm , not in the heat of the moment . Bock put one client in a slow-pitch batting cage . By imagining his boss 's face on each ball , the man was able to rid himself of the physical urge to break the guy 's neck . <p> WRITE IT DOWN . Every time you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . " You may see patterns . Some people get mad on certain days of the week , " says George Rhoades Jr. , Ph.D. , a Hawaii psychologist . Identifying trends is the first step to changing them . <p> EXERCISE .
