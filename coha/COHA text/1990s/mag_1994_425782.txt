Section : NEWS Crisis of credibility ' forces change . <p> A velvet revolution is sweeping through the nation 's seminaries . Like the velvet revolutions that have been transforming Eastern Europe from top-down , autocratically ruled , bureaucracy-driven countries , theological seminaries in the United States are being forced into change for survival 's sake . <p> On the surface , seminary education at many institutions appears to be in robust health . In 1992 , the Association of Theological Schools ( ATS ) reported a 9.8 percent enrollment increase over 1991 , the largest single increase ever recorded . There was a full-time-equivalent enrollment of 46,400 students in more than 210 institutions . This fall , at least one school reports a 20 percent increase in 1994  --  95 total enrollment over the previous academic year . Other institutions around the country say they have similarly healthy programs . <p> Yet many experts who have looked beyond the numbers are sounding the alarm that seminaries face a " crisis of credibility . " They say seminaries are in danger of " downsizing " faculties , programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for theological training  --  the local church itself . They see churches being buffeted by cultural trends , while seminaries persist in graduating students conversant in Greek , Hebrew , and classical theology , but not acculturated to ministry in post-Christian America . The familiar tension between ivory-tower theory and leading-edge practicality in theological education has been further strained by the sometimes radically new answers given to age-old questions : What should pastors really be accomplishing through their churches ? What makes a " good theological school " ? How can the church be effective in a post-Christian age ? <p> With a renewed sense of urgency , some of the nation 's top seminary leaders are preoccupied with comprehending this paradox of seemingly healthy seminaries facing a bleak , uncertain future . As a result , theological institutions  --  whether independent , interdenominational , university-based , or church-support-ed-are re-engineering themselves for a new era , intentionally using a business-world attitude to refocus attention on their " customers "  --  the churches and students they are supposed to serve . In many cases , substantive change is occurring at a glacially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenting with bringing the seminaries into churches , restructuring courses , mentoring students long-term , and using telecommunications , video , and computers in the classroom . <p> Earlier this year , a report on graduate theological education in the Pacific Northwest , based on a year of study and funded by the Murdock Charitable Trust , found : Seminary students often have the same doubts as nonbelievers , see themselves as victims , and have a " deep hunger " for role models and mentoring . Seminaries are producing pastors the same way they did 30 years ago , are financially weakened by administrative overhead , and take little responsibility for selecting students bound for ordination . Lifelong tenure for professors and the accreditation process have , in some cases , been obstacles to strategic change . Pastors today , on average , are 44 years old , married , have been in ministry 14 years , and make more than $32,000 annually ; are " largely satisfied " with their own job performance , but believe they were " poorly prepared " for their jobs . <p> The Murdock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors and discovered dramatic disagreements about the abilities that seminary graduates should have in order to minister effectively in churches . For example , while pastors and laypeople rank theological knowledge as fifth of five top priorities , seminary professors say it should rank topmost . <p> " Pastors are mad at the seminary , " says John Woodyard , program officer with the $275 million Murdock Trust . The trust financed the $100,000 study because so many seminaries were making large requests for grants that Murdock officers were in " sticker shock " and wanted to find out for themselves about the state of seminary education . <p> " The seminary faculty do not have a good understanding of the needs of local churches or the culture , " Woodyard says . " The raw material , the students coming up today , are vastly different from 20 years ago . They 're coming to seminary banged around by the culture or their family . They have a very low sense of call , for the most part . " <p> Woodyard says the trust , through its grant making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it may be too little , too late . " Seminaries have come in and said , ' We 've got a $300,000 deficit this year , and praise God , it will only be $400,000 next year . ' And we say , ' You 've got to be kidding . ' We look at some books and find out that they are playing with their restricted endowments , moving money around . In the next 10 years , I think you are going to see a lot of seminaries go down . Some are too top-heavy . Too much debt . Too much in facilities . " <p> In 1989 , Leon Pacala , then ATS executive director , described his perception that the most profound change within seminaries was the emerging shift from a " clerical paradigm " ( preparation of clergy ) to a " community of faith paradigm " ( a multipurposed nurturing of knowledge and understanding of a faith community ) . Many trends have given rise to the shift . Since the 1970s , enrollments in preordination tracks , such as master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the total enrollment to less than 50 percent . While the rate of increase in women 's seminary enrollment-up sixfold since 1972  --  has leveled off , minority enrollments , especially among Asian/Pacific students , continue to grow rapidly . The average age of incoming students has increased to 38 at some schools . Seminary leaders today find they must work feverishly just to keep from falling behind an American culture keenly interested in personal spirituality , but disaffected from the traditional church practices . ON CAMPUS <p> Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary , set atop a hill with a commanding seaside view of Boston 's picturesque North Shore , fits hand in glove with the ivory-tower , monastery-like model of a seminary community of students and scholars pursuing theological truth and preserving church doctrine and tradition . <p> On a sunny Thursday in August , Haddon Robinson , sitting at a large desk in a small basement office , takes time to reflect on his views about seminary education , which he freely admits he has " given his life to " by teaching at Dallas Theological Seminary for 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now being a teacher of preaching at Gordon-Conwell . <p> " It used to be , when you graduated in the 1950s and ' 60s , you got out into the First Episcobapitarian Church , and you may not have had much training in how to be a good church person , but the congregation knew what a pastor did , " Robinson says . <p> " Give them a year , and they 'd whip you into shape . But 85 percent of our churches have plateaued or are declining . " Robinson believes laypeople expect their pastor to know how to penetrate the secular society and attract new people . <p> Many seminaries see themselves caught in an endgame of rising overhead expenses and a decreasing ability to raise tuition , tap endowments , or draw on denominational support . Robinson sees the declining economic viability of seminaries driving the institutions either into bankruptcy or an across-the-board restructuring . Surveys have shown an enormous divergence among institutions in the cost of educating a student through a typical degree program , ranging from a low of $5,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to the high cost of theological education by working while pursuing a degree , borrowing through government loan programs , increasing the number of years of study to attain a degree , or pursuing a less rigorous and costly degree program . A recent survey by the Center for the Study of Theological Education at Auburn Seminary found that 22 percent of 1991 M.Div. graduates had borrowed $10,000 or more by the time they graduated . Singles , women , and African-Americans were more likely to obtain loans and borrowed greater amounts than the average . The effects of students working while in school and student debt levels have been harmful overall , Robinson believes . " I see fellas that go to class , work for ups , study , come to class again , and they 're dead . It beats the daylights out of marriages . <p> " Many students treat the seminary like a 7-Eleven . They drop in , take the course , and leave . If they graduate at 35 or 36 with a debt of $25,000 , you 're not going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the kind of money that will pay that off . " <p> Robinson at times shifts dramatically between an acute sense of despair and a sober hopefulness for theological education . " You do n't have to keep the same structures . Everything should be on the table . Do n't just change the bones in the cemetery . The single most-important ingredient in theological education is the church . The hard question is : What is the deep need of the church ? " THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE <p> Trinity Evangelical Divinity School , located in suburban Chicago and associated with the Evangelical Free Church of America , has found , like other schools , that many students choose a seminary based on geography , not just theology , and are embarking on second careers . Only 13 percent of Trinity students are from the Evangelical Free Church , with the rest coming from 122 other denominations . <p> During the lull between the summer and fall sessions , students and others at Trinity spoke to CHRISTIANITY TODAY about their perspectives . " People outside seminary raise issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recognize them as Kant 's and Barth 's issues , " says Mark Lewis , a 31-year-old , first-year M.Div. candidate who spent six-and-a-half years as a lawyer before entering seminary . Matthew Coburn , a third-year M.Div. candidate , says , " If students come here wanting schemes , strategies , formats , techniques . . . they will be frustrated . " Second-year student Ben Gilder says , " To say that studying theology is not practical is a contradiction . Any time you explain why a person should do something like ' love your neighbor ' you make a theological statement . " <p> As Trinity 's academic dean , W. Bingham Hunter has seen a " ratcheting up of expectations " for both pastors and seminaries . He says today 's pastor is asked to run " a multiplicity of ministries , " including coping with racial issues , unemployment , divorce , marital counseling , and crisis intervention . Those expectations are sometimes based on unrealistic standards , Hunter argues . " Uniquely gifted pastors who are celebrated in the media become the standard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trinity does not see its main role as spiritual development , per se , " says student Coburn . " There are plenty of opportunities for spiritual input . It is possible to go through Trinity , to work hard and learn , and come out without a heart for ministry . " <p> One way institutions have attempted to bridge the credibility gap has been to bring top pastors into seminary leadership . This year , both the liberal San Francisco Theological Seminary ( SFTS ) , a Presbyterian school , and the interdenominational Dallas Theological Seminary have hired pastors as presidents . <p> Donald McCullough , the new president at SFTS , says , " To remain faithful to a central calling and also respond to market needs requires living in a creative tension . All the time . At the heart of theological education must be the training of pastors who , in turn , can train laity within their own congregations . " EARNEST INNOVATION <p> To their credit , seminary and church leaders have been laboring earnestly to solve the challenges posed by the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronts of curriculum , accreditation , cost controls , student demands , and church needs . <p> One of the tried-and-true innovations of the past has been to create satellite campuses . For example , Gordon-Conwell has established programs in inner-city Boston as well as Charlotte , North Carolina . Yet some schools have pushed that idea even further by creating a satellite " seminary without walls . " <p> In Seattle , through a cooperative venture between Regent College in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , and Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena , California , the Seattle Association of Theological Education ( SATE ) is providing a program to 450 students , some commuting 250 miles . <p> In order to create a community atmosphere in the seminary 's nonresidential setting , SATE requires students to take one class per quarter , for a total of 12 courses over three years  --  or one-third of an M.Div. course load  --  with the same group of students . <p> Eight of those courses are memorships in which half the course load is taught by a seminary professor and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leaders of parachurch organizations . Through this arrangement . the student " watches ministry being done " in areas such as preaching , evangelism , pastoral care , management , and Christian education , explains SATE 'S executive director , Timothy Dearborn . " These are not internships , but a way of taking course work out of the classroom . " <p> Many of the program 's courses are taught in church buildings , exposing students during the course of their studies to " 25 different churches from a broad array of traditions . . . and different patterns of ministry and worship , " Dearborn says . <p> To help meet students ' spiritual needs . SATE requires them to meet once a month for three years with a support group comprising a pastor and two laypersons of the student 's choosing . <p> Two years ago , the program was granted provisional accreditation by ATS , which itself is in the midst of a historic review of the accrediting process and standards . According to Dearborn , it is the first time ATS has granted provisional accreditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend one year on a campus and in which so many courses are partly taught by nonacademicians . The program has been setting the pace for interinstitutional cooperation . <p> Other schools are turning to technology as a means of taking the seminary to the students . Asbury Seminary in Wilmore , Kentucky , using portions of a $58 million bequest from Ralph Waldo Beeson , is creating a new center that will feature the latest in video information services , allowing classes taught at Asbury to be transmitted anywhere in the world . <p> Technology at the center will also enable teachers to access maps , charts , library materials , and segments from other lectures for use in day-to-day teaching . " Teachers will be able to hook up a phone to the system and access speakers from the outside , " says Ken Boyd , executive director of multimedia systems . " Basically , they will have everything they need at their fingertips . " <p> Increasing numbers of bivocational and second-career students " tell us we have got to approach theological education differently from in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theological Seminary . " We have to go to the people rather than always have them come to us . " SUPPORT FROM HOME CHURCHES <p> Still other schools believe mentoring and church internships should be at the center of theological training . Conservative Baptist Seminary of the East ( CBSE ) , rounded by a visionary group of pastors who believed that their seminary experience had not prepared them well for congregational ministry , has made a closer tie between the student and the local congregation an integral part of the curriculum . <p> CBSE requires each student 's home congregation to affirm its belief that the student is divinely called to professional ministry and , in most cases , makes that church the primary locus of a student 's education . The seminary develops internship agreements by which the church provides two supervisors to oversee the internship , and the student places him-or herself under the care and supervision of the congregation . Students and supervisors meet weekly to assess student growth in character and ministry skills . <p> To facilitate student immersion in church ministry , classes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits are earned through a system that requires no classroom time , and the seminary runs 11 months a year , offering three 15-week semesters , which reduce course load per term by a third . <p> According to Robert Ferris , author of Renewal in Theological Education , many of CBSE 'S students choose the seminary " over traditional seminaries because of CBSE 'S program of church-based ministry training . " Rob Jones , CBSE 's vice president for advancement , says nearly 50 percent of CBSE students come from congregations not affiliated with the Conservative Baptist Association of America . <p> " Faculty and students , internship supervisors , and participating congregations all seem to agree that the CBSE formula represents an effective approach to training for ministry , " writes Ferris . RACIAL , CULTURAL DIVERSITY <p> At Philadelphia 's Eastern Seminary , a key to growth has been the school 's embracing of cultural and racial diversity . Enrollment at Eastern Seminary has steadily increased during the past five years . This fall , Eastern added 102 students , about 20 percent more than the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase is due to several factors , including Eastern 's " concerted attempt to be a centrist evangelical institution that affirms bringing both the social and personal aspects of the gospel to all people . " This year 's entering class includes 45 percent women and 39 percent African-Americans . One-third of Eastern 's faculty is female and one-third is African-American . <p> Brauch says Eastern " strongly affirms the equal partnership of men and women in all ministries . " For more than 20 years , Eastern has had a women 's organization that serves as a support group for female students and addresses the specific concerns of women seminary students . <p> Recently Eastern and two nearby seminaries , Westminster and Lutheran Theological Seminary , made an agreement with African-American clergy in the Philadelphia area to provide at least ten courses jointly in a three-year span , taught from an Afro-centric perspective , explains academic dean Eric Ohlmann . <p> To prepare ministers in the Latino community , Eastern in January will begin offering a certificate program in pastoral care and counseling for Hispanic clergy . " Often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor for counseling long before they would go to a professional counselor , " says Brauch . <p> At Dallas Seminary , Donald Campbell , president emeritus , says the school has instituted a program of spiritual formation in which students meet regularly in groups of six to eight for discussion of " issues related to spiritual life , vision , giftedness , and accountability . " Participation is required of students in their first two years at Dallas . <p> In another change , Dallas has abandoned the concept of an academic major for " ministry tracks , " in which students choose from various ministry emphases , including Bible translation , church planting , counseling , evangelism , media arts , pastoral ministry , cross-cultural ministries , or leadership development . " These force students early on to consider life goals in terms of ministry , " Campbell says . NEW WINE , OLD WINESKINS ? <p> In spite of the hundreds of schools making changes affecting tens of thousands of students , some researchers maintain a clear-eyed skepticism about whether such changes are truly structural , or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a church consultant based in Arizona , was hired by seven seminaries to travel the country in conjunction with Leadership Network ( a parachurch ministry for large churches ) , interviewing pastors about their needs . <p> She spent seven months on the road , with her husband driving as she pounded her notes into a laptop computer . Weese says that after 97 two-hour-long interviews with pastors and their staffs , " I was pretty convinced that if a seminary really wanted to take seriously what these pastors were saying , it would take reshaping or reforming the whole structure of seminary education . <p> " It would mean taking it all the way down to the foundations and rebuilding it . Something 's got to happen . The church is not going to wait . If the seminaries do n't wake up and come along , they will be left in the dust , " she says . <p> Some church leaders believe they have sufficient resources to train new pastors . Last year , for example , there were an estimated 3,000 church-sponsored conferences for pastors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , we 'll just teach them what they need to know . ' And that 's okay , but that 's a one-generation hand-me-down . There is a need for seminaries , but they need to do it differently . They need to put new wine in new wine-skins , not something new in an old form . " <p> No doubt , as seminaries retrofit , re-engineer , or restructure their programs , they will have the opportunity to move into a new era , where theology and church practice cooperate rather than compete .

Giles . <p> SEMINARY WOMEN REWRITE THEIR STORIES ' <p> The historic surge of women into the nation 's seminaries has changed the face of student bodies like few other trends . <p> Rebecca Chopp , professor of systematic theology at Candler School of Theology , Emory University in Atlanta , has traveled the country during the past four years interviewing seminary women for a new book . <p> " To me , the most startling revelation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewrite their personal history , rewrite their lives , to write a new story , " says Chopp , who is also dean of faculty at Candler . <p> Although many theologically liberal institutions have a higher percentage of women students than some conservative ones , that has not necessarily translated into a fully welcoming attitude within an institution . " I can immediately think of two of the most liberal seminaries in the country where women find it extremely difficult , " Chopp says . " And , I could name one major evangelical seminary where women find an extremely good experience . " <p> One chronic issue for women pursuing a degree leading to ordination has been the relatively low number of American churches placing women in pastoral roles . <p> Mary Lou Lavallee , a deployment officer who puts parishes and pastors together when vacancies occur in the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts , says that today nearly all the search committees in her diocese at least consider a woman candidate , but few hire them . She says search committees will often say , " ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Based on her experience , older women as a group are least open to women in pastoral roles . <p> Donald Campbell , recently retired president of Dallas Theological Seminary , believes , " Seminaries which train women for senior pastor positions have placement problems . But we focus on the opportunities that women have within a biblical paradigm rather than on the opportunities they might not have . " <p> According to Chopp 's research , career pursuits may not be foremost in the minds of many women in seminary . She says external events  --  death , divorce , or other unusual experiences  --  lead women to use theological education to " help make sense " of their future . <p> PHOTO : Rebecca Chopp <p> By Timothy C. Morgan . <p>
