New York formerly New Amsterdam . North American city ( population c. 7,000,000 ) . It is the largest city in the USA ( and in North America ) and the country 's financial and cultural centre ; it is also the seat of the United Nations . New York is sited mostly on islands at the mouth of the Hudson River on the east coast of the continent , and its development and rise to prominence have been closely related to its location on one of the world 's finest all-weather , deep-water ports . New York City originally comprised only Manhattan , a narrow , 20 km-long island bordered by the Hudson River , East River and Harlem River , which remains its commercial , financial and cultural heart . In a series of mergers in 1874 and 1894 the borough of the Bronx became part of New York City , and in 1898 Brooklyn ( then the third largest city in the USA ) , Queens and Staten Island elected to join in the formation of Greater New York , which spreads over c. 830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland , Brooklyn and Queens occupying the western end of Long Island . Often regarded mainly as a great modern metropolis of glass and steel skyscrapers , New York retains a rich architectural heritage from all periods of its development , during which time it was briefly the capital of the USA ( 1785-90 ) and the state capital of New York ( 1784-96 ) . // I.

After 1945. // 1 . Before c. 1790 . The site of New York City was originally occupied by a series of Native American settlements . The first European to record a visit to the harbour ( 17 July 1524 ) was Giovanni da Verrazano , an Italian employed by the French . He was followed by Henry Hudson , an Englishman who claimed the area for the Dutch in 1609 . In 1621 the Dutch West India Company was granted a charter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the first permanent Dutch settlers arrived . The Dutch erected a fort at the southern tip of Manhattan Island ( which Governor-General Peter Minuit purchased ' from the Indians in 1626 ) , and small buildings were erected on surrounding land , establishing New Amsterdam as the capital of New Netherland . Settlement soon followed in what would become the city 's other boroughs . In 1653 Governor Peter Stuyvesant enclosed the Manhattan settlement with a wall across the island from the Hudson River to the East River at the latitude of Wall Street in New York 's present-day financial centre . Although no buildings remain from this settlement , the original street pattern survives in the area south of Wall Street . // On 12 March 1664 the British sailed into the harbour of New Amsterdam and seized the colony , renaming it New York , although it never became one of the major cities of British North America . Settlement during the British colonial period expanded both on land and out into the water on several blocks of landfill , and Manhattan was connected to the mainland by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Harlem River . The British erected Trinity ( 1696 ; destr. 1776 ) , the city 's first Episcopal church , on Broadway and Wall Street and also established the first college , King 's College ( now Columbia University ) , in 1754 , erecting a building ( 1756-60 ; destr. c. 1857 ) on Park Place . The city was occupied by the British during the American Revolution ( War of Independence , 1775-83 ) and suffered from fires set by revolutionaries and , after the war , from serious depopulation . Only one significant building survives from the old British city : St Paul 's Chapel ( 1764-8 ; tower , 1794 , by James C. Lawrence ) , Broadway and Fulton Street , one of the most important Georgian churches in the USA. // 2. c. 1790-c. 1870 . As the city recovered from the war and its population again began to increase , development moved northwards up Manhattan Island . During this process , hills were levelled and swamps and water-courses filled in to create the relatively flat landscape of the present city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the streets led the New York state authorities in 1807 to establish a commission to plan the unsettled parts of Manhattan . The Commissioners ' Plan ( 1811 ; see Urban Planning , fig. 9 ) established the rectangular grid of streets north of about Houston Street that was one of the key determinants of the city 's physical form , with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west and numbered east or west of Fifth Avenue . The Dutch street pattern of Lower Manhattan was preserved , as was the layout of the small village of Greenwich on the west side of the island , south of 14th Street . Broadway , originally a part of the Dutch road connecting New Amsterdam with Fort Orange ( now Albany ) , cut diagonally across the island and was intended to survive only as far north as 15th Street in the plan , but it was later preserved , creating small but distinctive open spaces where it crossed the north-south avenues ( e.g. at Times Square and Columbus Circle ) . With the exception of a few open squares , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioners ' plan was an indication of the increasing confidence of civic leaders in the early 19th century , as was the construction of a new Neo-classical City Hall ( 1802-12 ; by Joseph Francois Mangin and John McComb jr ) , Broadway and Murray Street , one of the most beautiful works of the period anywhere in the USA. // New York owed its wealth and dramatic growth in the 19th century to its commercial ascendancy following trade war with Britain ( 1812-14 ) . Its harbour became the busiest and most prosperous on the continent with the establishment of regularly scheduled trans-Atlantic voyages ( 1818 ) , the opening of the Erie Canal ( 1825 ) , which made New York the principal port for goods travelling to and from the West , and close connections with British traders . New York 's merchants were responsible for much of the lucrative southern cotton trade , and the convenience of water-borne transport also led to New York becoming the USA 's leading manufacturing centre . As a result of this activity the city 's commercial core spread from the waterfront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fairly modest , many serving as both residence and office , but after the great fire of 1835 many architecturally distinguished counting-houses , warehouses , banks and other commercial establishments were erected . Wall Street had begun to evolve into a financial centre as early as 1796 , when the city 's first bank , the Bank of New York , opened there . By the 1830s its pre-eminence as New York 's commercial and financial centre was firmly established with the construction of such imposing , stone Greek Revival buildings as the United States Custom House ( now Federal Hall ; 1833-42 ; by Town &amp; Davis ) ; and the Merchants ' Exchange ( 1836-41 ; by Isaiah Rogers ; enlarged 1904-10 by McKim , Mead &amp; White for First National City Bank ) . // New York 's commercial success led to a continuing rapid increase in its population , which grew from c. 33,000 in 1790 to c. 124,000 in 1820 ; during this period New York overtook Philadelphia as the nation 's most populous city , as people moved to the city from the farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major port of entry for European immigrants . Residential neighourhoods began to develop at the northern fringes of the settled area , with the wealthiest quarters almost always along Fifth Avenue and flanking streets . A few architect-designed mansions were commissioned , but the vast majority of New York 's early 19th-century residential buildings were terrace houses ( row houses ) erected by speculative builders . As commerce continued to expand , commercial establishments also began to move north , eventually invading the residential areas and forcing the more affluent to move to new neighbourhoods even further north . This process , which continued until the advent of zoning restrictions ( 1916 ) limiting large-scale commercial development to the area south of 59th Street , explains why relatively few early and mid-19th-century residential neighbourhoods in Manhattan survive intact . // In the 1820s Brooklyn also began to evolve as a major middle-class residential centre , growing at an extraordinarily rapid pace : a village of c. 7000 inhabitants in 1820 , it was incorporated as a city in 1834 and had become the third largest city in the USA by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of safe and reliable ferry services , allowing people to live in Brooklyn and commute to work in Manhattan . Miles of speculative terrace housing were erected in Brooklyn , and , since it had only a small commercial centre of its own , almost all its 19th-century neighbourhoods survive . Small residential communities housing commuters to Manhattan also grew along the Queens and Staten Island shorelines and across the Hudson River in New Jersey . // Architecture in New York before the Civil War ( 1861-5 ) tended to be rather conservative in nature . The styles and building types popular during the first half of the 19th century generally appeared first in other American cities and were based on European precedents . Until the mid-1840s all but the most imposing structures were built of brick and ornamented with Federal style or Greek Revival details . Only church steeples rose higher than four or five storeys . In the 1840s , however , brownstone began to supplant brick as the principal building material in New York , where it was used for the new Gothic Revival Trinity Church ( 1839-46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of residences . A type of sandstone , brownstone became popular because it was quarried in parts of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , convenient for water transport to the city . Commercial and public buildings were often faced with grey Tuckahoe marble quarried just north of the city . The popularity of both brownstone and marble coincided with the population explosion in New York and Brooklyn and a corresponding boom in residential and commercial construction . Between the 1840s and 1860s large Italianate mansions were erected on and around Fifth Avenue ( most destr. ) , and hundreds of Italianate terrace houses were built on streets in Manhattan and Brooklyn . The marble A. T. Stewart Department Store ( 1845-6 ; extended 1850-84 ; later the Sun Building ) , 280 Broadway , by Joseph Trench &amp; Co. ( 1815-79 ) was the first Italianate-style commercial palace , similar commercial buildings subsequently rose throughout New York 's business districts . Some of the finest , including the Haughwout Building ( 1856-7 ; by John P. Gaynor ) , 488 Broadway ( see fig. 1 ; see also United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facades modelled to imitate stone . // During this period New York became the centre of the architectural profession in the USA when the American Institute of Architects ( AIA ) was founded there in 1857 . Most of its members , including Richard Upjohn , James Renwick and Alexander Jackson Davis , were prominent New York professionals . Nevertheless , only a small number of trained architects were active during this period , and they were primarily responsible for the city 's most important buildings , for example the Gothic Revival St Patrick 's Cathedral ( begun 1858 ) , Fifth Avenue and East 50th Street , the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in the USA ( see Renwick , James , fig. 2 ) . The majority of terrace houses continued to be erected by speculative builders without the aid of architects . // The mid-19th century was also marked by the genesis of two of New York 's most splendid construction projects : Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge . Central Park , occupying the centre of Manhattan Island between 59th Street and 110th Street , was planned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increasing population density and the spread of development north into previously open land . Work began in 1858 on the Greensward Plan by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux , which created an almost totally artificial yet naturalistic landscape ( see Park , fig. 2 ) . Olmsted and Vaux also designed Prospect Park ( 1865-73 ) , Brooklyn . Brooklyn Bridge ( see fig. 4 below ) , a suspension bridge across the East River from Lower Manhattan , was designed by John Augustus Roebling ( see Roebling , ( 1 ) ) and was finally begun in 1869 after years of planning and debate . Construction was completed in 1883 . The bridge created a physical link between New York and Brooklyn that ultimately led to their political union . It also dramatically cut commuting time and led to the conversion of farmland far from the river into new residential neighbourhoods . // 3. c. 1870-c. 1920 . After the Civil War , which hampered growth in New York as a result of the loss of the cotton trade , the repudiation of Southern debts and contraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a severe depression beginning in 1873 that brought building to a virtual halt . Recovery late in the 1870s led to a boom lasting until World War I with only short interruptions ( notably following a financial panic in 1893 ) . During the final decades of the 19th century New York 's population increased at an enormous rate , reaching c. 3.4 million in Greater New York by 1900 , stimulated by the arrival of waves of immigrants who generally settled in overcrowded tenement districts ; sections of Manhattan 's Lower East Side had a population density thought to have been the highest in the world at that time . In contrast , the wealth of New York 's more affluent residents reached unprecedented levels , reflected in the scale and grandeur of the residences , clubs , churches and other buildings erected for the social and financial elite . // The economic boom of the 1880s coincided with a change in architectural taste as the restrained brownstone palazzo style lost favour and was replaced by more dynamic eclectic forms ; the houses ( 1888 ; by C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Mark 's Avenue , Brooklyn , for example , typify design inspired by Henry Hobson Richardson 's Romanesque Revival style , while other buildings , such as the Century Building ( 1880-81 ; by William Schikel ) , in Union Square , exemplify the English-influenced Queen Anne style . During this period railways brought building stone of various colours from many regions of the country , and brick also returned to popularity . The boldly massed and richly textured buildings of the 1880s and early 1890s were almost all designed by architects , for the profession had by then expanded , and city building codes required that an architect be involved with every project . // By the final decade of the 19th century most of the USA 's leading architects had offices in New York , many establishing practices there after studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris . They specialized in the design of buildings inspired by historic European and American colonial styles as well as contemporary French Beaux-Arts ideals , setting the stage for an academic revival that had a far-reaching influence on American design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ( see United States of America , sections II , 3 and 4 ) . This can be seen particularly in the work of McKim , Mead &amp; White , Carrere &amp; Hastings , Warren &amp; Wetmore , Richard Morris Hunt ( see Hunt , ( 2 ) ) and Delano &amp; Aldrich . This mode of design was introduced at Hunt 's William K. Vanderbilt House ( 1879-82 ; destr. ) , 660 Fifth Avenue , and McKim , Mead &amp; White 's Villard Houses ( 1882-5 ) , 451-7 Madison Avenue , modelled respectively on Late Gothic/early Renaissance French chateaux and the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome . The construction of such a variety of buildings beside one another , particularly in and around Fifth Avenue north of 59th Street , created what some critics found to be a discordant ensemble ; however , it reflected the American desire both for individuality and for buildings comparable in size and grandeur to those in Europe . Meanwhile speculative terrace housing aimed at the middle classes continued to be built on the Upper West Side , in Harlem and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tenement construction also increased as immigrants continued to pour into the city ( see Tenement Building ) . // The growing wealth and importance of New York was accentuated at the turn of the century when prominent New Yorkers sponsored a series of monumental public buildings intended to symbolize the city 's civic and cultural aspirations . Of a scale and design sophistication rivalling contemporary work in Europe , they included the New York Public Library ( 1897-1911 ; by Carrere &amp; Hastings ; see fig. 3 ) , Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street ; Pennsylvania Station ( 1902-11 ; by McKim , Mead &amp; White ; destr. 1963-5 ) ; and Grand Central Terminal ( 1903-13 ; by Warren &amp; Wetmore and Reed &amp; Stem ) , Park Avenue and 42nd Street . Other educational and cultural complexes included the major additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ( original building 1874-80 , by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould , with additions by Richard Morris Hunt , 1894-5 ; Richard Howland Hunt and George B. Post , 1895-1902 ; and McKim , Mead &amp; White , 1904-26 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia University ( plan 1893-4 ; see McKim , Mead &amp; White , fig. 3 ) , Morningside Heights ; and the New York University ( plan , 1892-4 ; by McKim , Mead &amp; White ; now Bronx Community College ) in the Bronx . Private funding also paid for impressive building to serve the social needs of the populace , including such churches as the Cathedral of St John the Divine , Amsterdam Avenue and West 112th Street , begun in 1892 with a Byzantine design by Heins &amp; LaFarge and rebuilt after 1912 as a Gothic Revival building ( for illustration see Cram , Ralph Adams ) ; and St Thomas Episcopal Church ( 1906-12 ; by Cram , Goodhue &amp; Ferguson ) , Fifth Avenue at West 53rd Street ; the University Club ( 1896-1900 ; by McKim , Mead &amp; White ) , 1 West 54th Street ; and the New York Yacht Club ( 1899-1900 ; by Warren &amp; Wetmore ) , 37 West 44th Street ( see Club , fig. 2 ) . // During these years of expansion in the final decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed as distinct types and major components of New York 's urban fabric . Both were stimulated by increasing population growth and rising land values due to the construction of the subway system ( inaugurated 1904 ) and three more East River crossings , the Williamsburg Bridge ( 1903 ; engineer Leffert L. Buck ) and the Queensboro and Manhattan bridges ( both 1909 ; engineer Gustav Lindenthal ) . The former is a cantilever bridge given architectural form by Palmer &amp; Hornbostel , while the latter is a suspension bridge designed by Carrere &amp; Hastings , who also designed the Beaux-Arts-inspired bridge approach on Canal Street , with a triumphal arch ( 1910-15 ) . In addition , several Harlem River spans connected Manhattan and the Bronx . The new bridges provided avenues for new development in Brooklyn , Queens and the Bronx . // Before the 1870s virtually the only New Yorkers who lived in multiple dwellings were the poor . As land values rose , single-family houses became prohibitively expensive , and , under the influence of French residential custom , apartment houses came to be an acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type was the French-inspired Stuyvesant Apartments ( 1869-70 ; by Richard Morris Hunt ; destr . ) , East 18th Street . It was not until the 1880s , however , that such buildings became popular with the middle classes ; thereafter stylish , richly textured buildings were erected , for example the Dakota ( 1880-84 ; by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh ) , West 72nd Street , the Gramercy ( 1882-3 ; by George da Cunha ) , Gramercy Park East , and the Chelsea ( 1883-5 ; by Hubert , Pirrson &amp; Company ; now Hotel Chelsea ) , West 23rd Street . At the turn of the century enormous French Beaux-Arts style apartment buildings with exuberant carved facades were erected , particularly on the Upper West Side , and in the early 20th century luxury apartment houses for the wealthiest proliferated , particularly after the construction of McKim , Mead &amp; White 's 998 Fifth Avenue ( 1910-12 ) , the first luxury apartment house to rise amid the individual residential palaces of Fifth Avenue . // The development of the skyscraper paralleled that of the apartment house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift ( see Skyscraper , sections 2(i) ) . The building generally accepted as the first skyscraper was New York 's seven-storey Equitable Life Assurance Building ( 1868-70 ; by Arthur Delavan Gilman and Edward Kendall , with George B. Post ; destr. 1912 ) , Broadway and Cedar Street ; this was the first office building in New York with a passenger lift and the first to exploit the lift 's potential by placing the finest offices on the upper floors . Throughout the 1870s and 1880s a succession of buildings rose ever higher , but all had masonry load-bearing walls ; skeleton construction was introduced to New York with the Tower Building ( 1887 ; by Bradford Gilbert ; destr. ) , 50 Broadway . Unlike their counterparts in Chicago , who invented a new design approach for skeleton skyscrapers , architects in New York preferred to adapt traditional architectural styles to the structure : George B. Post , R. H. Robertson , Francis H. Kimball and Cass Gilbert , for example , were responsible for buildings with Romanesque , Renaissance , Beaux-Arts , Gothic and other historicist cladding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete to produce the tallest building , culminating in the 241-m Woolworth Building ( 1910-13 ; for illustration see Gilbert , Cass ) , 233 Broadway . // The succession of tall buildings , mostly erected in the narrow streets of Lower Manhattan , generated a growing concern for their effect on light and air that peaked with the construction of the 40-storey,116,000 sq. -m Equitable Life Headquarters ( 1912-15 , by Ernest R. Graham ) , covering an entire square block along lower Broadway . In 1916 the city authorities promulgated the USA 's first zoning ordinance , which , as well as restricting the spread of large-scale industry and development , required that buildings be stepped back above a certain height to ensure that light and air reached the pavements ; this code accounts for the distinctive shape of many of New York 's skyscrapers . // 4. c. 1920-1945 . Although the zoning law had little immediate effect owing to the cessation of building during World War I , in the 1920s its effect was widespread , as an enormous amount of office construction took place in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Midtown , a new business centre that developed further north around 42nd Street near the new Grand Central Terminal . Many of the first skyscrapers erected under the new zoning were designed in the academic styles popular before the war . Beginning with the Barclay-Vesey Telephone Building ( 1923-7 ; by Ralph Walker ) , 140 West Street , however , the code began to be exploited to create towers with dramatic silhouettes. // The 1920s encompassed a period of both extreme conservatism and great ferment in New York . As the expense of maintaining a private city residence increased and the motor car , together with new bridges , tunnels and parkways , made commuting convenient , affluent people began to move out of the city into surrounding suburbs , particularly to the north in Westchester County . Many mansions and terrace houses in Manhattan were converted or demolished and replaced by apartments ; some terrace houses , particularly those in the East Midtown area , were stripped of their brownstone facades , which were replaced with more stylish Colonial Revival brick fronts or streamlined stucco forms , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of six-storey apartment buildings was erected to house a newly emerging middle-class population that was moving out of such slums as the Lower East Side . The design of these apartment buildings , with neo-Tudor , Spanish Colonial , Colonial Revival and Gothic Revival details , echoed the styles favoured for contemporary houses in the suburbs . // At the same time , new influences on architecture in the late 1920s were provided by the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes ( 1925 ) , Paris , which attracted a number of young American architects  --  among them Ely-Jacques Kahn and Irwin Chanin  --  who returned to the USA and began adapting the new decorative forms . Kahn 's 2 Park Avenue ( 1926-7 ) and Chanin 's Chanin Building ( 1927-9 ; with Sloane &amp; Robertson ) , 122 East 42nd Street , were among the first of the Art Deco office towers that create the famous silhouette of the New York skyline ( see fig. 4 ) . This development culminated with the Irving Trust Building ( 1928-31 ; by Ralph Walker ) , 1 Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be chiselled from a single block of limestone . The Chrysler Building ( 1928-30 ; by William Van Alen ; see Skyscraper , fig. 2 ) , 405 Lexington Avenue , and the Empire State Building ( 1929-31 ; by Shreve , Lamb &amp; Harmon ; for illustration see Shreve , Lamb &amp; Harmon ) , 350 Fifth Avenue , two of the city 's most famous Art Deco towers , were erected to be the world 's tallest building and came to symbolize New York 's vitality . // Modernist features began to appear in architecture in New York in the late 1920s , notably in the work of Raymond Hood , for example his Daily News Building ( 1929-30 ; for illustration see Hood , Raymond ) and McGraw-Hill Building ( 1930-31 ; see Building Regulations , fig. 3 ) , both on 42nd Street ; a fully developed modernism appeared in the work of Swiss-trained William Edmond Lescaze , his residence and office ( 1933-4 ) at 211 East 48th Street being the earliest International Style structure in the city , with its ribbon windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features also appeared at Rockefeller Center ( 1931-40 ; for illustration see Rockefeller ) , designed by Associated Architects and one of the few major projects begun during the Depression , which virtually halted building work in New York ( see also Corbett , Harvey Wiley , and Harrison &amp; Abramovitz ) . Rockefeller Center , which includes the elegant , 70-storey RCA Building by Raymond Hood , is the USA 's finest example of a planned urban complex , incorporating offices , theatres , shops and gardens as well as public art projects ( see sections II below ) . Several important bridges and tunnels were also constructed at this time : most notable were the George Washington Bridge ( 1927-31 ) across the Hudson River connecting Manhattan and New Jersey and the Triborough Bridge ( 1929-36 ) connecting Manhattan , Queens and the Bronx , both by engineer Othmar H. Ammann , working in association with Cass Gilbert on the George Washington Bridge and Aymar Embury II on the Triborough . These bridges are part of a large-scale highway system built under the jurisdiction of Robert Moses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flushing Meadows , Queens , stimulating such associated public works projects as the development of North Beach Airport ( 1939-40 ; by William Delano ; now La Guardia ) . // 5 . After 1945 . After World War II , when many European architects moved to the USA , the International Style began to play a major role in architecture in New York , beginning with the United Nations Headquarters ( 1947-53 ; see Government Building , fig. 2 ) , First Avenue between 42nd and 48th Street . The complex , set on a landscaped site , was designed by an international committee of architects directed by Wallace K. Harrison ( see Harrison and abramovitz ) . The International Style corporate architecture of glass was initiated with Lever House ( 1950-52 ; see International Style , fig. 2 ) , 390 Park Avenue , by Skidmore , Owings &amp; Merrill ( designer Gordon Bunshaft ) , and it set the stage for the development of the Midtown area around Park Avenue , Third Avenue and Sixth Avenue into canyons of glass and steel . The International Style reached its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seagram Building ( 1954-8 ) , 375 Park Avenue , a tower set in an open plaza ; this building became a model for the change in the city zoning code ( 1961 ) in which the step-back requirements were replaced by options leading to the construction of many slabs set in public plazas . The race for the world 's tallest building continued , leading to the construction of the 411-m twin towers of the World Trade Center ( 1964-74 ; by Minoru Yamasaki &amp; Associates and Emery Roth &amp; Sons ; see fig. 5 ) , which have load-bearing external walls clad in stainless steel . // During the 1950s and 1960s , while most speculative builders and corporate clients were engaged in building glass and steel towers , other organizations , particularly institutions , adopted a more expressionistic approach to modernism ; this can be seen in such buildings as the white , spiral Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ( designed 1943-56 ; built 1956-9 ) , 1071 Fifth Avenue , by Frank Lloyd Wright ; the abstract , granite-faced Whitney Museum of American Art ( 1963-6 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell structures of the TWA Terminal ( 1956-62 ; see Roof , fig. 3 ) by Eero Saarinen at John F. Kennedy Airport . Of the same period , the main halls of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts ( 1959-66 ) , Amsterdam Avenue and West 62nd Street , designed by a board of architects headed by Wallace K. Harrison , are classicist in inspiration ( for illustration see Harrison and Abramovitz ) . // In the early 1960s the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge ( 1964 ; by Ammann ) was opened , linking Staten Island to Brooklyn , and the World 's Fair ( 1964-5 ) was held in Flushing Meadows . A building boom in the 1960s and early 1970s abruptly halted with a severe economic recession beginning in 1973 and New York City 's virtual bankruptcy in 1975 . Late in the boom , new forms of modernism began to appear , as in 1 United Nations Plaza ( 1973-6 ; by Kevin Roche , John Dinkeloo &amp; Associates ) , an office and hotel complex with a variety of geometric forms clad in a taut glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late 1970s and the 1980s , notably at the World Financial Center ( 1981-8 ; by Cesar Pelli ) , a series of stone and glass towers , each with a different , geometric rooftop . In 1979 Philip Johnson and John Burgee ( b 1933 ) popularized Post-modern design with the AT&amp;T Building ( 1978-83 , now the Sony Building ) , Madison Avenue , featuring a Renaissance arcade at the base ( since altered ) and a Chippendale pediment ' ( see Post-modernism , fig. 1 ) . This was followed by a succession of extremely tall buildings with masonry or ornamental glass skins , historicist detail and eccentric rooftop silhouettes ; among the finest are works by Kohn Pederson Fox , notably the Heron Tower ( 1984-7 ) , 70 East 55th Street . Extensive new construction took place during the late 1980s in the Times Square area as zoning incentives attracted massive hotel and office projects . // Meanwhile New York 's residential population underwent tremendous change as thousands of middle-class families moved to the suburbs and many of the older urban neighbourhoods deteriorated . Residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily limited to the construction of apartment houses in the prestigious East Side neighbourhoods of Manhattan , subsidized apartments in poorer areas and suburban homes at the edges of the city . The 1960s were marked by the emergence of the conservation movement , seen in the establishment of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and two associated trends that had a profound impact on residential development in the city : in the first , artists began to discover the industrial lofts in the depressed 19th-century commercial districts of Manhattan , especially in SoHo , the area south of Houston , and Tribeca , the triangle below Canal Street , which had been left empty as industry moved out of Manhattan after the early years of the century . In the 1970s and 1980s , as loft-living became fashionable , converted industrial buildings became a major component of the city 's housing stock .

A new neighbourhood in harmony with the city 's older residential areas was created in the 1980s at Battery Park City , built on landfill in Lower Manhattan to a master plan ( 1979 ) by Cooper Eckstut Associates . // New York 's construction boom of the 1980s , stimulated by thriving service industries , resulted in the construction of a vast amount of new office space and many luxury apartment houses . At the same time , however , rising costs forced the departure of other businesses and large numbers of the middle classes , eroding the municipal tax base . Further challenges were presented by the economic recession of the 1990s , which led to high vacancy rates in many of the new office buildings , a virtual cessation of construction and severe cutbacks in the city 's services . The city nevertheless remained the architectural centre of the USA and the country 's most dynamic urban centre . // II . Art life and organization . // 1 . Before c. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // 1 .

Art ownership was a symbol of wealth and power to this mercantile class , and they freely commissioned portraits of themselves and family members , bolstering their positions in society and , at the same time , preserving a historic record for future generations . Since there were no trained artists in the country at this time , portrait commissions were undertaken by limners '  --  untrained , itinerant artists  --  who travelled from city to city . Their flat , linear style was modelled on European prints , which freely circulated throughout the colony . The anonymous portrait of Governor Peter Stuyvesant ( c. 1660 ; New York , NY Hist . Soc. ; see fig. 6 ) is a good example of this early style . // The English settlers who arrived in the new British colony of New York after 1664 were predominantly Puritan , with ascetic tastes and strong strictures against the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal ostentation were allowed , but portraiture nevertheless continued to be popular in New York and its environs during the colonial period : the sitter 's status and wealth were subtly emphasized by meticulous detailing in clothing and furnishing . The Protestant preoccupation with death is recalled in the emblems of mortality that appear in both painted portraits and gravestone carving , the only sculpture produced at this time . Gravestones provided a lively form of stone relief-sculpture , incorporating images of mortality in an elaborate iconography that employed skeletons , skulls , hour-glasses marking the passage of time , and animated figures of Father Time . This later changed after the American Revolution ( 1775-8 ) , when artists were no longer bound to strict Puritan belief systems and began including portrait busts and reliefs of the deceased to mark their graves . During the early colonial period topographical views of New York were also produced , which remain fine documents of the city 's architecture . // At the beginning of the 18th century , New York was a hub of commerce and contained a burgeoning art community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Dutch style was still retained by painters . Gerret Duyckinck was the first portrait painter to emerge in the early part of the century , employing a straightforward realism with sharp angles in the drapery that was characteristic of the New York style . In the early part of the century partially trained painters began migrating to North America , bringing an academic tradition and skill to their portraiture . John Smibert from Scotland was one of the first emigres : although he settled in Boston , he was patronized by visitors from New York who would also have seen his collection of copies of European works , which had a major influence on American artists in New York . By mid-century English painters such as John Wollaston had arrived . The richest area for portraiture in colonial America could be charted from New York City to upstate New York around Albany , the clients being mostly wealthy Dutch patroon families . Paintings with Classical or religious themes were not generally commissioned , but detailed views of New York harbour were popular in the mid-18th century , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many artists were looking to Europe for instruction and experience , and some moved there permanently , seeking a new venue for their art . // 2. c. 1778-1913 . After the Revolution monuments were needed to create a national identity for the new American nation . Since local sculptors were not sufficiently skilled , European sculptors were commissioned in the 1790s to create the first of these heroic monuments . It was not until the early years of the next century that commissions were given to American sculptors , and a new age of sculpture was born in the USA . The 19th century marked a turning point for American art , as the narrow strictures of previous times were relaxed and academically trained American artists for the first time began to rival their European counterparts . Portraiture , landscape , allegory and history painting became popular . The depiction of landscapes included the 20 aquatints in the Hudson River Portfolio ( 1820-25 ) , published in New York by William Guy Wall and John Hill . John Vanderlyn , who had been in Paris , returned to paint an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Met. ) , which he exhibited in a rotunda in City Hall Park in 1815 . However , the public was not enthusiastic about a depiction of a European landmark . In contrast , when in 1859 Frederic Edwin Church exhibited his meticulously detailed , epic masterpiece the Heart of the Andes ( 1.68x3.03 m , 1859 ; New York , Met. ; for illustration see Church , Frederic Edwin ) , showing a vast South American landscape , the public enthusiastically viewed the painting through binoculars in a dimly lit room , as if actually in the depicted terrain . Church 's landscapes typified the work of the Hudson River School , begun by Thomas Cole . // The evolution of art societies and some of the great museums of New York also began in the early 19th century . The New-York Historical Society , founded in 1804 , was the first museum in New York and had numerous sites before settling at its permanent address at Central Park West and 77th Street . The basis of the museum 's collection was formed by two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York : Thomas Jefferson Bryan and Luman Reed . Reed , who was one of the most influential art patrons in the USA , opened the first art gallery in the country in 1832 in his mansion in downtown Manhattan . Another institution , the Brooklyn Apprentices Library , started in 1823 in a modest space , but in 1843 it was relocated in the larger Brooklyn Lyceum building and renamed the Brooklyn Institute . A fire in 1890 necessitated a new plan for space for the growing collection , and in 1895 a new building was begun that later became the Brooklyn Museum . Meanwhile , in Manhattan the construction of New York 's most distinguished museum , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , began in 1874 ( see sections I above ) . This formidable landmark structure on upper Fifth Avenue gradually achieved status as one of the great museums of the world . // One of the first art organizations in New York in the early 19th century was the American Academy of Fine Arts , founded in 1801 by a group of businessmen and amateur painters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was founded there by a group of professional artists , and , under their exclusive management , the artist-members of the NAD held important exhibitions and produced publications that were the highlights of the art season in New York . Modelled on the Royal Academy of London , the NAD also had a school for academic training for young artists and a professional association , membership of which was considered the mark of excellence for painters and sculptors of the day . The formation of this group helped to establish New York as the art centre of the country in the 19th century . Nevertheless , the stalwart traditions of the NAD came under attack by younger artists returning from study abroad in the 1870s , and a splinter group broke with the academy in 1877 to form the Society of American Artists . This had a more liberal policy of inclusion and promised exhibitions to artists based on merit rather than on political alliances , as in the entrenched academy . Walter Shirlaw and Augustus Saint-Gaudens were among the founders of this group , and in 1878 John La Farge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Art Students League ( ASL ) in 1875 while the NAD school was temporarily closed . When it reopened , the ASL continued to operate , and its student body had swelled to more than 1000 by the late 1890s . Its liberal educational policy led the way to a decidedly modern school , and the addition of William Merritt Chase to the faculty in 1878 strengthened its power and prestige . // In 1897 the group known as the Ten American Painters broke with the Society of American Artists to stage their own exhibition of American Impressionist work at the P. L. Durand-Ruel gallery , New York ; the group , containing artists from both Boston and New York , including Childe Hassam , Edmund C. Tarbell , John H. Twachtman and Julian Alden Weir , continued to exhibit for many years . In the early 20th century Alfred Stieglitz founded the Photo-secession group in New York to fight for recognition of photography as a fine art , and the exhibition of photography at the National Arts Club , New York , in 1902 heralded a new era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the gallery that became known as 291 ( see ) in New York , showing avant-garde artists from the USA and Europe . Through shows of Picasso , Braque and Picabia , Stieglitz introduced Cubism to the USA , and he promoted the work of such young American artists as Arthur Dove , John Marin and Georgia O'Keeffe . In 1908 the artists known as The Eight ( i ) led a revolt against the conservative NAD with their exhibition at the Macbeth Galleries , New York . The Eight included a core group of William J. Glackens , George Luks , Everett Shinn , John Sloan and their leader Robert Henri . Their work had been rejected from the academy 's exhibition of 1907 , and they decided to organize the 1908 show as a counter-exhibition , to include in addition Arthur B. Davies , Ernest Lawson and Maurice Prendergast . Their loosely rendered impressions of everyday life in New York , characterized by gritty realism in urban scenes , earning them the label of the Ashcan School , decisively broke with academic tradition . // 3. 1913-39 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern art , the Armory Show , was held in New York , marking the advent of modernism in the USA and transforming the art market in New York . The show grew out of a desire by members of the Eight ( i ) to plan an exhibition of artists affiliated with the progressive Association of American Painters and Sculptors to show contemporary trends in American art . Difficulty with funding led them to ask Arthur B. Davies who had exhibited with the Eight in 1908 ( see sections 2 above ) and had solid financial connections , to take charge of fundraising . Davies accepted but envisioned a much different show , and with the aid of Walt Kuhn ( 1877-1949 ) and Walter Pach , who had been living in Paris , the original idea was expanded and became the International Exhibition of Modern Art , better known as the Armory Show after its location at the Armory of the 69th Regiment in New York ( see fig. 7 ) . Some 75,000 people attended the exhibition ( 17 February-15 March 1913 ) , which received a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War I brought many European artists to New York , and a new era began . Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia arrived in 1915 , excited by the energy of the large metropolis that they had first visited for the Armory Show . Their notoriety from the show provided them with an instant audience and standing in the art community with artists and collectors , and they soon became part of the circle formed around Walter Arensberg . An avid collector and poet , he gathered together a group of young American modernists , including Marsden Hartley , Arthur Dove , Man Ray , Charles Demuth , Charles Sheeler and Morton Livingston Schamberg ; through Duchamp , the group had links with the more advanced theorists from abroad . Moreover , Duchamp and Man Ray formed the influential New York Dada group at this time ( see DADA , sections 2 ) . Sheeler , Demuth and Georgia O'Keeffe were the most significant exponents of the movement known as Precisionism , a Cubist-inspired style . In the 1920s several new museums devoted to modern art were established in New York : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man Ray and Katherine S. Dreier , establishing a permanent collection of important European art ( now at New Haven , CT , Yale U. A.G. ) ; and the Museum of Modern Art ( MOMA ) opened in 1929 , gradually developing a major role in defining modernism and helping New York to establish a base in the international art scene . The Whitney Museum of American Art , which opened in 1931 on West 8th Street , Greenwich Village , was headed by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Juliana Force and was dedicated to showing American art from both the past and present . This policy continued after the museum moved to its permanent building ( 1966 ) on Madison Avenue at 75th Street and in its satellite museums dispersed throughout the city . Other important museums were established on Fifth Avenue , including the Frick Collection ( opened 1935 ) , housing art from the Renaissance to the 19th century . Solomon R. Guggenheim 's collection was partly opened to the public in 1939 in the Museum of Non-objective Painting , East 54th Street , but in 1960 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Frank Lloyd Wright 's spectacular building on upper Fifth Avenue . // The Great Depression of the 1930s particularly devastated New York 's art world . The New Deal , the plan for recovery devised by President Franklin D. Roosevelt , instituted the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) to solve unemployment in general , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) to employ artists who would create a positive national identity and engender a sense of pride in the USA . Hundreds of artists in New York were employed to paint murals . Artists as diverse as Stuart Davis and Thomas Hart Benton all worked together on the FAP , painting murals in schools , post offices and various government buildings . The Art Deco Rockefeller Center ( 1931-40 ) , for example , was decorated with many large murals , exterior wall reliefs and free-standing sculpture by FAP artists . Important murals were also created by African American artists involved in the political , literary and artistic movement known as the Harlem Renaissance ( see African American art , sections 2 ) , and the Community Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became an influential focus for African American art . The political and social realities of African American life were explored by such artists as Jacob Lawrence ( b 1917 ) , who arrived in Harlem in 1927 and learnt about the history and art of African Americans at the 125th Street Public Library . His compelling narrative paintings , characterized by a strong Cubist vocabulary , explored the political and social realities of the USA for African Americans . By 1934 , according to estimates by the College of Art Association , 1400 artists were living and working in New York , indicating the rapid growth of the artistic population , which by the late 20th century numbered tens of thousands . Many political artistic organizations were active during the 1930s : for example the John Reed Club ( founded 1929 ) , the Artists ' Union ( founded 1933 ) and the Communist-affiliated American Artists ' Congress ( founded 1936 ) , which declined in 1940 after its apparent support of the Soviet invasion of Finland . Political concern continued in the work of the social realist painters William Gropper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who expressed outrage at social injustice . The decade ended with the World 's Fair of 1939 , in which the work of the FAP artists was exhibited . // 4. 1940 and after . The fall of Paris to the Germans in 1940 had an overwhelming effect on that city 's role as the international centre of modern art . As an influx of European artists moved to the USA , artistic attention turned to New York . The emigres included Fernand Leger , Piet Mondrian and such Surrealists as Max Ernst , who profoundly influenced artists in New York , especially the Abstract Expressionists . Abstract Expressionism was promoted by Peggy Guggenheim , Ernst 's wife , who opened the Art of This Century gallery in 1942 , with interiors designed by Frederick Kiesler ( see fig. 8 ) . The Abstract Expressionists were particularly influenced by the Surrealist concept of Automatism , linked with an interest in chance and the notion of the unconscious developed by Sigmund Freud . Their loosely connected movement formed the New York school , comprising the gestural painters ( Franz Kline , Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters ( Mark Rothko , Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still ) . They began showing their work at artist-run cooperatives on 10th Street , near their studios . Many of the Abstract Expressionists were members of The Club on West 8th Street , which had sprung up in 1949 and included Rothko , Still , David Hare , Robert Motherwell , and the musician John Cage . They met weekly to discuss art in general and , in particular , the place of the American artist in the international art world . // In the 1950s the economy of the Cold-War era fostered a new group of galleries in New York ; the small artist-run galleries of 10th Street were supplanted by the large galleries of 57th Street and upper Madison Avenue , which began showing the Abstract Expressionists . In 1951 MOMA presented the exhibition Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America , which affirmed American dominance in the art world , and in 1958-9 it mounted The New American Painting , which marked the first official recognition of Abstract Expressionism by a major museum . The shows travelled to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socio-political changes of the 1960s were reflected in artistic developments in New York as abstraction gave way to the new figurative style of Pop art . This had been anticipated in the 1950s by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg , whose work , using found objects , photographs and popular imagery , was influenced by both Abstract Expressionism and Dada . Pop art , whose exponents included Andy Warhol , James Rosenquist , Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg , used popular imagery in order to comment on contemporary society : it emerged in the USA in 1962 in the New Realists exhibition at New York 's Sidney Janis Gallery , and also received exposure at the New York World 's Fair of 1964-5 . Another development was the foundation of the African American group Weusi ( Swahili : blackness ' ) Nyumba Ya Sanaa , in Harlem in 1965 , whose work relied on African iconography . In the 1960s many artists ' studios relocated to the industrial neighbourhood in SoHo , south of Houston Street , and to its eastern border on The Bowery ( see sections I , 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , larger SoHo quarters on West Broadway and its environs . Towards the end of the 1960s Conceptual art and Minimalism emerged to challenge the vision of American life explored in Pop art , with a return to elemental abstract forms and purity . A major exhibition at New York 's Jewish Museum , Primary Structures ( 1966 ) , showed the work of sculptors Donald Judd , Robert Morris ( ii ) and Tony Smith . Later , the post-Minimalist work of sculptor Eva Hesse opened up these developments to a broader discourse . In the late 1960s such artists as Michael Heizer , Dennis Oppenheim , and Robert Smithson , who derived many of his ideas from visits to the American Museum of Natural History in New York , filled galleries with boxes of earth , rocks and broken glass , for example , which were augmented by photographic documentation of works made in the western USA and in Canada ( see Land art ) . // In the 1970s work continued to be produced by conceptual and performance artists , who used the gallery space to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hans Haacke called into question the power-structure of museums , collectors and the large corporations who generally sponsored art exhibitions ; the highly popular performances of Joseph Beuys recalled the Happenings ' of Allan Kaprow in the late 1950s and early 1960s . In the mid-1970s a shift to the Tribeca area , south of Canal Street ( the boundary of SoHo ) , was begun , because of inflated rents in SoHo : Tribeca soon contained new galleries and performance spaces , as well as artists ' lofts . In 1979 the museums and other cultural institutions in upper Fifth Avenue formed a consortium to encourage cooperation among themselves , and in 1981 their section of the Avenue was renamed Museum Mile . This contains the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , the Museo del Barrio , dedicated to Hispanic art , the Museum of the City of New York ( founded 1923 ) , the International Center of Photography ( founded 1974 ) , the Cooper-Hewitt Museum , Smithsonian Institution , National Museum of Design ( founded 1897 ) , The Jewish Museum , the National Academy of Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new wing for contemporary art . // New York art life in the 1980s erupted with a return to an expressive figuration or neo-expressionism that was being pursued by young artists in the East Village . The area 's gallery scene first began in the apartment in 9th Street of Joanne Mayhew-Young , a young artist who hung some work in her bathroom and opened it to the public in 1983 . People came , including critics who took the idea seriously , and the Gracie Mansion Gallery was born . The low rents drew many young dealers , who showed the new figurative work at affordable prices , and the well-attended openings of exhibitions attracted great attention . Soon , better established galleries from other parts of Manhattan were opening branches here , and the area became a centre for all types of art for several years . However , its novelty wore off , resulting in a retreat to the more acceptable venues of lower Broadway , on the eastern edge of SoHo . Due in part to the inflated New York art market of the 1980s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These ranged from appropriation art to the diverse Neo-Geo group epitomized by Sherrie Levine 's rigid , geometrical work and the luminous abstractions of Ross Bleckner ( b 1949 ) . A visionary abstraction developed c. 1990 in the work of Susan Laufer , Bill Jensen ( b 1945 ) and Donald K. Sultan ( b 1951 ) and in the mysterious painted boxes of Lawrence Carroll . The Decade Show in 1990 , presented jointly by the New Museum of Contemporary Art , the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem , showed the art of the 1980s in a broader context . It presented a wide spectrum of significant art production , demonstrating the cultural diversity of artists in New York and across the USA.
