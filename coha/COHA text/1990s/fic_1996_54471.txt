Mars glows brightly just over the horizon , casting ghostly reflections on the waves . I look up at the sky , and my mind wanders . I hear the echoing cry of a slow freight train , winding its way along the track behind our beach house , back beyond the dunes . <p> Then , the familiar itching in the back of my skull , the thoughts , unbidden , come into my head . I am having a vision . <p> My mind 's eye blinks away the sleep , and I see the grade crossing behind the house , marked with only a small wooden sign , easily missed in the darkness . <p> The horn sounds again . It is a lonesome , mournful sound , like a prehistoric beast , the last of its kind , calling a mate that will never come . In my mind 's eyes , I can see the locomotive , rocking down the track , clattering its way over the old steel bridge a few miles north , pulling its load of empty log cars from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crossing , and the car that rolls up to the crossing , tires crackling and popping on the gravel , stopping squarely across the track . The woman driving is lost . She takes a map from a glove compartment and turns on the dome light . <p> I look across the dunes , and can see the light in the upper floor bedroom of my beach house . Behind it is the railroad , and just beyond , the highway . I think about the train , and try to estimate how far it is from the crossing . <p> She missed the turnoff for the freeway , thirty miles back . The intersection is poorly marked , and the moon is only now rising . People get lost there all the time . She studies the map intently . What was the name of the little town she just passed through ? She ca n't remember . <p> I begin walking up the beach , looking for the path between the beach front houses that will lead me to the street . I stumble in the darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the thin cloth of my slacks . I find the trail again , and quicken my pace . <p> The woman spots the right town on the map , but decides that she ca n't possibly have gone that far wrong . She scans the highway , twenty miles south of where she actually is , looking for landmarks she will never find . She hears the train , but thinks of it only as a geographical reference . The track is nowhere near the road she is looking at , but she is looking at the wrong road . <p> I come down the dunes between the houses across from my beach house . There is a streetlight , and I can see well enough to run now . Ahead of me is a small hill , and on the other side , the grade crossing . I am running , but I am out of shape . I have n't run more than twenty steps in years , and the little hill looms large before me . The locomotive cries out in warning . I can hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise . She looks around , but the dome light prevents her from seeing much in the darkness . She looks back at the paper just as the train rounds the bend , its headlight lighting up the highway behind the car . If she would only look up , she would see it coming , but she is looking at the map . <p> My legs pump weakly as I top the hill , lungs burning , eyes closed , I stumble and nearly fall , but I know the crossing is just ahead . <p> The locomotive sounds its horn , so close and loud now that it is painful . I grab my left ear and run on . <p> The woman looks up , sees the locomotive bearing down on her . She tries to start the car , but she has left the lights on . Her battery is weak , and the starter only clicks , like the click of the locomotive 's wheels as it bears down on her . <p> I run down the hill as fast as I can . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the approaching train as much as I hear it . <p> I open my eyes and the crossing is just ahead . <p> There is no car . Only a dog . <p> It is a small collie of some kind . It sniffs at something between the rails , oblivious to the train about to run it over , even as the behemoth sounds its final warning . <p> Stupid creature . It must be deaf as a stump . <p> I put my last reserves into a final burst of speed . <p> I trip on the gravel ballast next to the track , and turn it into a dive . I catch the dog around the middle , my shoulder striking the far rail painfully as I roll . I think the dog yelps as I hit it , but I can not hear . <p> We roll down the bank , and splash into a shallow ditch . <p> The train rumbles past , without having even slowed . <p> I kneel in the mud , my injured shoulder hunched like Quasimodo as I listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail like huge bells . <p> The dog licks my face . <p> I am elated . <p> Then I hear the crash , the scream of crumpled metal , as the train strikes the car stalled at the next crossing . <p> <p> By J.
