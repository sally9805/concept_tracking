WHEN THE BABY boom generation was growing up , parents worried about the effects of television on their children . Those same children  --  today 's parents  --  are , in turn , beginning to wonder about the effects of the latest preoccupation on the block  --  computers . Meanwhile , computer advertisements in the newspapers and on television are urging parents to give their children " the competitive edge they deserve . Our world is turning into a global marketplace , " the ads say , " and in order to compete on the grand scale , Canadian children must become highly familiar with and very skilled in the world of computers . " With pressure like that , some over - achieving parents are propping up their babies in front of computers and prompting them to " Press enter . " At what age should children be introduced to computers ? Some research recommends that three years of age or older is an appropriate time ; other studies suggest even two - year - olds may be introduced to simple single - keystroke software . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will develop an interest in the computer . In his review of research on Computers and Young Children , educator Douglas Clements suggests , " If computers are seen as a general educational tool , perhaps no one is too young . " Preschoolers who show the most interest in using computers tend to be older and brighter , according to research . In primary grades both girls and boys are interested , but utilization studies show that in later elementary grades boys are more active on computers than girls . Children now in elementary school are the first generation to become hooked on computers . This newest addiction stems from two major developments - affordable home computers and sophisticated , imaginative software . While their parents watch Star Trek reruns on television , today 's computer kids sit at the controls of a simulated USS Enterprise , battling Klingons and beaming down to alien planets " to boldly go where no one has gone before . " Children seem to possess a sixth sense about computers . They are not afraid to explore this new technology , whereas their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many families computers have prompted a role reversal in which parents have the insecurities of a novice and children have the self - assurance of an expert . Although some may hesitate to explore the new technology themselves , all parents are eager to learn more about its effect on their children . Is it helping or harming ? The US Report on the Effectiveness of Microcomputers in Schools ( a research review published by the Software Publishers Association ) found that children exposed to " developmentally appropriate " software showed significant gains in general intelligence and cognitive and motor development . The type of software is key . So far , software for young children is almost entirely educational , because parents are doing the selecting . Though dad might choose Play maker Football for himself , it 's Mickey 's ABC 's for junior . Once children reach the age of seven or eight , however , they discover recreational games through their friends or older siblings and the dilemma begins . If parents want their home computer to educate as well as entertain , they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Space Quest . Most software stores devote at least four times more space to recreational than educational software , which is generally slim pickings at best . Although the verdict is still out on the benefits of recreational computer games , there is some evidence of positive payoffs  --  besides fun . Arcade and simulation games can improve fine motor skills , eye - hand coordination , spatial skills , reaction time , memory and sequential thinking ; the popular role - playing games can also improve problem - solving skills . On the other hand , critics claim video and computer games are creating a generation of children with short attention spans , lack of imagination and creativity , and an acceptance of destruction and violence  --  the same criticisms that were and are level led at television . Much of the criticism was compiled in the early ' ' 80s , however , when PAC MAN was king . Today a smorgasbord of sophisticated games have silenced some critics , but many parents and experts are still concerned , particularly about the violent component of many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of violence in comic books , then television and now computer games . So far , experts have been of little help in delivering definitive answers . While one researcher calls the popular video game Super Mario Bros 3 an " aggressive zap - or - be - zapped game , " another calls it " a non - violent , educational and informative game " that won a Parent 's Choiceaward . A recent survey in Japan showed children who played video games longer and more frequently than others tended to be more aggressive , competitive and energetic ( characteristic type A behaviour ) . Unfortunately , the study did not disclose which came first  --  the type A personality or the obsession with video games . Then again , research is not necessary to show the frustration component of some computer games . Any parent of a four - , five - or six- year - old is familiar with video game - induced temper tantrums . " My son used to get so frustrated he would scream and throw things , " recalls Jan Mat trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She adds , " He still gets frustrated but he 's , learning to control himself better . " Although research shows computers in the classroom actually enhance social interaction and co - operation among children what about the effects of prolonged home computer use on their social life ? Maureen Kennedy 's son Cameron is particularly drawn to video and computer games , and used to spend so much time at the computer that his parents decided to set some guidelines . " He would be playing all the time if we did n't restrict his use , " Maureen explains . " He is allowed a half - hour a day , which he can accumulate , and extra time on weekends and other special days . " If parents feel computer play is isolating their child or cutting into other activities , experts do advise them to impose restrictions on computer use . But parents should n't be too quick to blame computers for a child 's faltering social life . Many " computer kids " form social networks and are constantly consulting with one another , sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing games together . " When my son Tim has a friend over , there 's always a lot of chatter , laughter and shrieking coming from the computer room , " relates Connie Sivak . In fact , research reports cases of otherwise socially isolated youngsters who gain self - esteem and social acceptance through their competency at computer games  --  similar to a child gaining peer acceptance through competency at sports . While the experts argue over the psychological and social effects of computer games , parents ask further questions - while their kids are honing fine - motor skills on the PC , what 's happening to their gross motor skills ? Balance is the word that best sums up experts ' advice to parents.Although the effects of hours spent at the computer terminal ( or video game controls ) are not always clear , too much of anything is generally less than ideal . Parents , then , should supervise the length of time their children spend playing computer games and aim for a balance in their content . Like it or not , children are attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else they do , computer games motivate . And they motivate by offering challenge and control and by stimulating curiosity and fantasy , according to researchers . Scott , an eight - year - old computer whiz , is particularly fond of fantasy role playing games . " I like King 's Quest , " he explains , " because it 's medieval and I get to fight witches , wizards and harpies . I like being part of the story  --  I get to go places I could never go in real life . I like how you can do or be anything you want . And I like going from one level to the next and finishing the game . " Any child who can work his way through a medieval adventure , complete a space mission or build a metropolis will be pleased with himself and enjoy a positive self - image . And as everyone knows , there is nothing like success to build self esteem , the cornerstone of learning . Parents and educators alike wonder how the interest , motivation and perseverance stimulated by creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , computer education in schools focused on content and drill and practice  --  pretty boring and unimaginative stuff . But hope is on the horizon , according to Larry Ho , a computer education specialist with the Vancouver School Board . " Slowly , software developers are learning how to create good educational software which stimulates , entertains and challenges , " he says . " Now we are able to introduce programs , such as the popular Carmen Sandiego series , that have content plus entertainment . " Since studies using the older , less creative software have indicated significant improvement in math , reading , writing and reasoning skills , today 's more imaginative software programs are likely to improve learning curves even more . Students are motivated by computer graphics and game formats , and like being in control . They also prefer the immediate feedback of computer programs and enjoy being actively engaged and being able to make mistakes without embarrassment . The use of computers improves attitudes toward both general school learning and specific school subjects , such as writing , reading , mathematics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " math anxiety , " among students who used it . Simply getting computers into the classroom is not the answer , however . The benefits of computer learning are tied closely to the teacher 's interest and ability to effectively integrate the new technology into the classroom curriculum . Schools with teachers who are well versed in computers can make best use of the technology . Unfortunately , most primary teachers have little or no experience in how to integrate computers into their programs and are receiving little professional support in adjusting to this new technology . " As a parent , " Ho advises , " you want to know if computer education in your child 's school is baby sitting or learning . " If parents are concerned about the quality of computer education in their child 's school , they can make a difference by learning about computers themselves , looking into the status of computer education at the school ( i. e. the technology goals of the school and the views of their child 's teacher regarding computers ) , offering to serve on a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer expert or assistant . Computers are not an educational panacea , but they do motivate children to learn , and in keeping with new educational goals , they teach children to " learn by doing . " Most important , though , by interacting with computers , children are learning basic skills that will become a necessity in almost every workplace in the near future . When it comes to recreational computer use , however , parents need to supervise their children 's time . Good , old fashioned play is a vital ingredient for a healthy , happy , balanced child . And , there is much to be learned about life away from the television and computer screen .
