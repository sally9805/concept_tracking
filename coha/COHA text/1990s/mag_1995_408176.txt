SLICK TIRES ? NO FRONT SUSPENSION ? Nope , you did n't turn to the wrong page . Santana 's Cilantro is the mountain bike tandem in our group test , and a darned good one . The $3,295 Cilantro reflects Santana 's traditionalist take on tandems . Founded in ' 76  --  ancient history in tandem terms  --  Santana has become a 2-seater leader by making rugged , light , smooth-handling bikes . No suspension beams or forks , no hydraulic brakes  --  nothing that is n't time-tested to withstand the extra punishment that tandem riding delivers . The Cilantro is a joy to ride . It had been more than a year since my wife , Janet , and I had taken our lone tandem ride together , so we were nervous as we pedaled the Cilantro into the woods . Our trip was slipped between one of the vicious rainstorms that socked northern California last winter , but despite the downed trees and ankle-deep mud , we rode with confidence . The bike is rigid and predictable even when climbing out of the saddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quick . Comfortable and roomy , too , thanks to a 21.75-inch front top tube and a 27.25-inch rear cockpit . The frame is built with TIG-welded Tange chrome-moly tubing , using the popular direct lateral design that features a tube extending from the rear bottom bracket to the head tube . All the tubes are seamless and double-butted , which is unusual for tandems . This yields a feathery 9.18-pound frame ( for the small size we tested ) and an excellent complete-bike weight of just over 40 pounds . Fine details abound . The boob tube ( connecting the 2 bottom brackets ) and beefy chainstays are ovalized for greater rigidity . The eccentric ( the front bottom-bracket-mounted unit that controls timing chain tension ) features an elegant , easy-to-adjust , one-piece design . Special braze-ons let the captain fine-tune the rear brake and both derailleurs while riding . Other braze-ons accommodate fenders and front and rear racks . You also get a pump pep and 4 water bottle mounts . However , on the small frame size we tested , 2 of the bottle mounts  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to access while riding . The massive Tange chrome-moly fork features a unicrown design with a reinforced , 1-1/4-inch steerer for added strength . The blades sport a massive 36.5-mm outside diameter . The result is a reassuringly bombproof fork that weighs a decent 2.3 pounds  --  not much less than most suspension forks . Which brings us back to the question of why Santana shuns front suspension . An off-road tandem seems like a good application for a suspension fork or stem , considering the big bike 's limited maneuverability and extra weight . But Santana says it has tested many suspension systems and has n't found one that can take the abuse . Two big concerns are bottoming out and independent fork-leg movement . Maybe so , but at times we still wished for front suspension , like when the front wheel hits a big hole and wants to turn sideways from the impact . A sturdy suspension fork or stem would soften the bumps and increase control . At least one other editor swears that front suspension should be standard on all off-road tandems . Santana 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspension seatpost for the stoker ( a modified version for the captain costs $150 extra ) . Featuring an 8-inch stack of elastomers and adjustable preload , the post was a marked improvement over a rigid rear end . " It 's like going from an economy car to your uncle 's Cadillac , " says Janet . Another suspension option is to install wider tires . We immediately replaced the Avocet Cross 26x1.9-inch inverted-tread tires ( which Santana specs because most shops wo n't permit off-road test rides ) with 26x2.1-inch knobbies . These worked well , but we wanted more cush . Unfortunately fork and chainstay clearance is limited . We could n't even get a 2.5-inch-wide tire to fit without hitting the fork crown . Santana says by the end of summer bikes will come with modified forks and chainstays for improved clearance , a change we heartily endorse . No major complaints about the components . The Shimano Deore X/LX cantilever brakes , equipped with special long arms for increased power , performed beautifully . The bike is set up to easily accommodate a third brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary braze-ons  --  but we did n't feel a need for more stopping power . The rear brake cable did get fouled on one especially muddy ride ; we 'd consider replacing it with a sealed cable if we constantly rode in really sticky muck . Shimano 's 8-speed drivetrain worked well , too . It features Deore XT Rapidfire Plus shifters , whose numbered gear indicators are a godsend for the captain . And shifting is crisp and quick , thanks in part to the XTR rear derailleur 's extra-long cage . Gearing was adequate , though the 28x32T low forced us to grunt up steep climbs . A smaller inner chainring would be nice . The 40-spoke Wheelsmith-built wheels are another highlight . The rear wheel sports wide , 160-mm spacing and a symmetrical , dishless design for added strength . The Edco Competition hubs boast oversize axles to resist bending or breaking , plus they feature quadruple bearings in the rear . We had no problems with these wheels despite abuse . ( Heavy , hardcore riders may want to consider the 48-spoke wheels , ( for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusty SPD 77 clipless pedals and Vetta SL saddles ( one women 's and one men 's ) . <p>
