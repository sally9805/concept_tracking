<p> It took four years , a shipwright and help from the British to create the blue whale model installed in the National Museum of Natural History . After 33 years , it still attracts millions annually <p> For the past three decades 8,000 pounds of fiberglass has been " sounding " from the ceiling in the Life in the Sea Hall of the National Museum of Natural History ( NMNH ) . It is the most stupendous proxy animal the museum has ever created . But at 92 feet in length and 34 feet in height , it no more than does justice to the dimensions of the huge creature it represents  --  the blue whale . <p> The blue is the largest animal that has ever lived . In real life some blues reach 100 feet , which makes them longer than an apatosaurus . Weighing in at some 150 tons , one blue whale is heavier than 25 full-grown African bush elephants . In death the creatures once provided meat for dogs and humans ; oil for lighting , margarine and face cream ; glycerin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speed of blues ( at up to 25 knots  --  or 29 miles per hour  --  they went faster than whaling ships could follow ) , plus the fact that they sank swiftly when killed at sea , protected them somewhat during the first four centuries of the whaling industry . Then , in the late 1860s , Svend Foyn perfected a highly effective harpoon cannon that featured an exploding head . Worldwide whale protection did not set in until almost a century later , and the years in between brought these giant mammals to near ruin . During the 1930-31 season , for instance , 29,410 blue whales were killed in the Antarctic . An estimated 350,000 blues have been killed in the 20th century . <p> The whales ' great scarcity and sheer size have always posed considerable problems for museums wanting to display full-size specimens . As A. E. Parr of the American Museum of Natural History rather delicately pointed out in 1963 , " Since whales do not perch , the problem of presenting them in their living form was a good deal more complicated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature that now awes visitors in the Sea Hall of the National Museum of Natural History  --  the second blue whale to be displayed there in this century  --  is not a stuffed whale . Or even a model made from measurements taken direct from a dead whale by NMNH scientists . The Smithsonian 's first life-size museum whale , however , which the current whale replaced , was done from a dead whale . And a terrible fuss it turned out to be . To get it , Frederick True , then Smithsonian 's curator of mammals , had to dispatch a small team of taxidermists and paleontologists and numerous barrels of plaster of paris to a whaling station at Balaena , Newfoundland . That was in the spring of 1903 . <p> They waited for weeks . When at last a dead whale , 78 feet long , was secured , it took weeks more of " greasy , laborious and puzzlin " work to make plaster molds of the whale and then cut away the flesh . The skeleton was saved for shipment to Washington . The skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to manhandle flukes 17 feet across . Flippers tipped the scales at 800 pounds apiece . The whole mess , some 26,550 pounds of bone and mold , was shipped to Washington . <p> When it went on display in 1904 , flanked by a life-size model of a tyrannosaurus that , by comparison , looked about the size of a black Lab retriever loping alongside , it was a wonder . <p> By the 1950s , though , a growing trend in museum chic called for the display of animals looking as active as possible in a facsimile of their natural habitat . Despite its anatomical correctness , critics said , the 1904 model , with its flippers outstretched like stubby wings , did look a bit like a sausage coasting along in a low flight pattern . A new , improved action whale was needed . <p> The new Smithsonian whale was to be modeled on the wooden-ribbed , plaster of paris whale then hanging in the British Museum . The British helpfully shipped to America 34 small templates made from their model . These were enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final model was molded . The Smithsonian 's whale outgrew the British version by at least a foot  --  briefly becoming what a local journalist described as the " biggest whale in captivity . " <p> Even without having to wrestle with a flesh-and-blood whale cadaver , the construction and mounting of the new Smithsonian whale was an extraordinary challenge  --  as well as a dangerous chore . Overseeing the work was the late A. Remington Kellogg , a brilliant , irascible vertebrate paleontologist and a stickler for detail . Smithsonian whale modeler Michael Friello remembers that the blowhole and other parts of the blue whale model had to be recast again and again . Kellogg often explained that he was hoping to retire as soon as the job was properly done . Admonishing the crew to hurry up , he would swear and say , " You 'll keep me working forever . " <p> Friello remembers that the eight-man crew of carpenters , a shipwright and plastics experts who built the whale , eventually hoisting it up to a midair position , clambered up and down the web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without hard hats or safety belts , for four years . <p> A cabinetmaker , Friello was put in charge of cutting oval wooden frames  --  like those used to shape the fuselage of model airplanes  --  and laying longitudinal strips over them to create a skeleton for the whale 's body . Two layers of thick fiberglass mat were applied over plywood nailed to the frames . Then Friello crawled inside the whale and tore out all of the supporting wood  --  to keep the model 's weight down to a mere 8,000 pounds . As a last act , he and his mates painted their initials inside the whale 's condo-size mouth . <p> In 1963 , the same year that blue whales gained some measure of international protection , Natural History 's huge new proxy whale was finally installed where it is today , permanently arched in an arrested dive , seeming to plunge downward over the heads of awed visitors . <p> Despite A. Remington Kellogg 's eye for detail , the spectacular model has not been free of controversy . Blues feed near the surface by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the top of a silent butler ) and engulfing thousands of gallons of water along with myriad small , shrimp-like crustaceans called krill . Mouth and throat are accordion pleated to be expandable , the better to take in more water and krill . With the throat fully expanded , a whale 's front end is bulbous and swollen . As the next step in the feeding process , the whale closes a fine-meshed screen of baleen at the front of its mouth and expels all the water . The nourishing krill are conveniently caught by the baleen netting . <p> For centuries , whales were depicted as having bulging throats  --  based on blurry surface sitings and dead whales , whose throats were often distended either by gases caused by decomposition or by compressed air pumped in to help float them after they were harpooned . The blue whale diving down at NMNH visitors has just such a throat . For the first decade or so of its display life , this was regarded as a lifelike touch . But by the late 1970s , an increase in scuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look and behavior of blues in action . Among such was a fact that whale experts at NMNH find embarrassing : after feeding , blue whales usually spew out their extra water before they dive . A model of a blue that is both diving and bulbous with water , experts say , shows an improbable situation . <p> On the heels ( or flukes ) of that information came a few other cosmetic inaccuracies . Its skin is too smooth , critics complain . The epidermis of real whales shows the ravages of time , scars from shark bites , assorted cuts and scabs , whale lice and barnacles . <p> If critics have their way , by the turn of the 21st century yet another whale model , this time warts and all , will succeed the first two . Meanwhile , just as it is , the sheer size and bulk of A. Remington Kellogg 's creature can still take the breath away and plunge the mind into the mysteries of the briny deep . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A visitor studies NMNH 's four-ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold tons of water  --  and thousands of krill  --  at a time . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Men using flensing knives prepare to deflesh a blue in 1903 .
