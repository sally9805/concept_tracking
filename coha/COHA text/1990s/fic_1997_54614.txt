I met my best pal , Phil , about ten years ago through our mutual wife . I was a young actor on the rise then , a couple of years out of Julliard , I 'd done two seasons of Biloxi Blues ( Broadway and a touring company ) and although I was raised as a nice Jewish boy , I kept getting cast as a grunt in a series of Oliver Stone flicks because of my Irish tough-guy mug  --  courtesy of a converted Catholic mother . So the phone was ringing , and the lunches were getting paid for , and the money was pouring in . I mean , I was feeling pretty good about myself back in those days . For a brief while , anyway , I was golden . <p> At the time , I figured those Vietnam movies were going to be my big break , or actually a series of little ones , running like fractures across a brittle tibia , chipping away at the bone of the business until I was in ; but something happened to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote Thai jungle . Oliver had us all go through two weeks of basic training with his own imported drill sergeant ; he 'd picked the guy up during his much chronicled tour in the Marines . The theory behind all this effort was verisimilitude , but it felt more like a frat initiation ; he wanted his pretty-boy actors to suffer as much as he had . Me , I went through that whole routine twice  --  twice a studio flew me firstclass to Asia in a skybed  --  which back then I thought was pretty cool , but now I see the entire episode as a fulcrum in my life , and if I had my choice of a chapter to reenact from Oliver 's nutty autobiography , I 'd prefer some dumb love story taking place at Yale . <p> See , I sailed though basic training on the first picture like a real Zen warrior  --  Oliver called me " Iron Man , " and the rest of the guys looked on me with awe  --  but what always happens when a guy dares to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chills , fever , hallucinations , the whole nine yards . And then when that was over , I got paranoid . The terrain in the jungle was leafy and thick , and the vine-covered trees were full of screaming monkeys . I 'd taken to constantly looking over my shoulder when I walked back and forth from the trailers to the latrine and brushing the ground before me with a stick . I think I was hunting for land mines . <p> By the time rehearsals were over and we were into the shoot , I was ten pounds lighter and smoking so much Thai-stick I really began to believe the set and script were real . I mean I really did . I believed that I was a bonafide member of Charlie Company . l guess that was Oliver 's aim . At night , back in the barracks , I had nightmare after nightmare of battle . Bombs blowing up , torched thatched huts , massacres of innocent villagers , skinny dogs . All that Nam via Hollywood stuff . Post-traumatic stress by proxy , the doctor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting . But if I do say so myself , it made for one of hell of a great performance . <p> Nevertheless , when I finally got home to New York , all I wanted was a musical here in the city , or a romantic comedy shot on the safety of a lot in Southern California . Jeannie , my best pal Phil 's ex and my current , then a casting agent , picked me up at a casting call . She says I had this great romantic , beat-up look back then , she says I looked like I needed someone to save me , but at the time I think she just wanted out of her marriage , and I was moderately successful , and if I may say so , a pretty sexy guy . <p> I 'm Scott Kaminsky . I grew up as Scott Kamins , son of Dr. David Kamins , a preeminent OB-GYN on Park Avenue , New York City , New York , a child of the Upper East Side , but when l joined the Screen Actors Guild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my roots . Took the name of my grandfather , a Russian peasant , one of nine barefoot but scholarly children working a grain mill in a shtetl somewhere in the hard-bitten Latvian fields . Kaminsky . It had a nice European ring to it , and in the early eighties , I thought it leant me a certain air of attractive hunger , a provocative ethnic panache . <p> Jeannie was scouting for an NBC sitcom , looking for a cop . She called me back three times to read ; I performed in a cold , empty studio stripped down to my skivvies . It was a locker-room sequence , broad and humiliating , and she strung me along shamelessly , Jeannie , so I was pretty pissed off , after a month of that tease , when my agent called to tell me I did n't get the part . That is , I was pissed off enough ( and intrigued enough ) to take matters into my own hands . I marched myself down to Jeannie 's office to give her a piece of my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impassioned speech about the toll of warfare , Oliver , and the jungle , and how after all I 'd been through for my country , I was entitled to a job  --  I still did n't get the work , but I certainly got the prize . Jeannie and I went out for beers at The White Horse Tavern , and then I wound up back at her brownstone apartment . <p> Upstairs , we mixed our liquors as quickly as we could in order to get the particulars on the table and out of the way as soon as possible . Jeannie was at the tail end of a marriage ( Phil ! ) and on her way to Southern California , where she wanted to make it big . She said , " I have impeccable taste . " Then she assessed me , professionally speaking , with a practiced eye . She said , " You 're a wreck , a sexy wreck , which I think should become increasingly marketable , as soon as you grow out of that dopey GI Joe phase . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts are right  --  and they 're always right  --  you just might become a star . " <p> It 's probably no surprise to you that I did n't . <p> Jeannie was pretentious and overblown and overly dramatic back then  --  now she 's pretentious and overblown and wound tight  --  and I liked it , especially the star business , I liked hearing her go on and on about me . But it would be wrong to pretend I actually listened , I did n't listen to anything Jeannie said that night , including the married part , I just liked to watch her pace and strut and wiggle around her tiny apartment while I built up the nerve to take her to bed . <p> I may have only been twenty-eight , but that first night spent with Jeannie harkened back to a wilder , mythical time , it made me nostalgic for the teenaged sex I never had  --  high school girls were loathe to do anything with the son of an OB-GYN , and much of my senior class was made up of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming and going in all sorts of directions , and by morning I was so slippery and wet that when she went to hug me , I swear I started to slide . After a shower in the bathroom down the hall , we dressed , me in my same khakis and white shirt , Jeannie in a polka-dotted mini and one of those fuzzy sweaters . And then we sat at her little scarred wooden table , and we drank our moldy old orange juice and ate our freezer-burned English muffins gazing into each other 's eyes . <p> At around eight o'clock a.m. , the key turned in the lock , and Phil walked in . Jeannie did n't even bat an eye . " Sweetheart , " she said to me ( " Sweetheart " ! ) , " this is Phil , my husband . " <p> We were fast friends , me and Phil . I mean , we hit it off that morning . I do n't know what possessed me to stick around when he first came home , plaid shirt untucked , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sake , and a gold band encircling his left ring finger  --  maybe it was because I already knew that I wanted this girls  --  but I did stay . <p> " Hey , sweetheart , " said Phil first to me with irony , and then to Jeannie in gentle , sweet defeat . <p> He was an embattled young novelist , coming home from a night shift as a proofreader at the law firm Sullivan &; Cromwell . They had met in a poetry seminar five years earlier at Sarah Lawrence . " He wrote me love poems , " said Jeannie , making a face , a hand over the phone receiver as she called the local deli to see if she could get them to deliver coffee and bagels  --  we 'd given up on the English muffins  --  which she could . Jeannie could get anyone to deliver anything , except Phil . He was thirty-two years old , he 'd gone back to college as an old guy after kicking around for ten years playing backup bass in a band and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , looking for attention . " It 's true , " said Jeannie . " Ask him what he does all day . Go ahead , " my love said cruelly , " ask him what it 's like to be a bum . " <p> I nodded in Phil 's direction , and Phil confessed , as was his way . In those days he was a beaten man . After the law firm he would usually just strip down to his underwear and lie on the futon couch for a few hours trying to catch a snooze , while Jeannie went to work . Then in the afternoons he 'd get up , make spaghetti , and watch thirtysomething reruns . Most of his day was spent , he said , actively not writing his book , not doing much of anything . <p> So we got to talking , me and Phil , because I liked thirtysomething and I liked to read a lot and , let 's face it , I 'd just poked his wife , so I owed him . We spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futon couch , now folded up , that Jeannie and I had spent the better part of the night rolling around on . By the time she came home for dinner , we had moved out to a local bar and back again , and when Jeannie came in the door , we were both already three sheets to the wind and into it  --  Phil was going to write a screenplay , a star vehicle for me  --  so we all ended up arguing plot points and story arcs and ordering Chinese takeout until Phil left for his nine o'clock shift and Jeannie and I unfolded the futon couch again . <p> It was only a matter of months of this before Jeannie moved Phil out and me in , only a matter of months after that that she got me to sport the last of my Oliver money on a diamond ring . Phil was my best man . We got married at Phil 's mother 's country cottage in Connecticut  --  she was , thank God , away that weekend , or even for us it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymoon in Paris ( they had gone to Rome ) Phil and I still spent most of our weekdays together , meeting for an afternoon movie after a morning audition , sitting in cafes discussing poetry over biscotti and bitter black coffees . He was a good man , Phil . He accepted his defeat easily . He had n't deserved his wife , and so he 'd lost her , period . Most of the time we shot the breeze , we drank or smoked a lot of pot , and waxed on and on about our dreams . I was still going to a lot of auditions back then , but I was coming up empty . It took about another three or four years before it became clear that I was permanently unemployed ; that , my total collapse as an actor , coupled with Jeannie 's first pregnancy , made our three-way marriage suddenly untenable . That 's when Phil wrote the letter . <p> Scott , dear Scott , <p> You 're my best friend and all that , but now you 've gone and impregnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . ( Ha ! Ha ! ) I 've decided to borrow some money from my mother and head out to the beach . Start over , live by the sand and the sea and do what I was meant to do , be who I was meant to be . If I can manage to eke out one halfway respectable novel , even if it 's not publishable , I 'll figure my time on earth was well-spent . But for now , the two of you are probably better off without me  --  I mean maybe now you 'll get a job . ( Ha ! Ha ! ) <p> Yours in friendship always , <p> Phil <p> He left the note hanging on the mirror above my dresser  --  he still had his old set of keys . Jeannie was glad to see him go . " That goddamned good-for-nothing , he 's infected you , you bastard . " Not that she did n't believe in me and my career  --  some nights when she could n't sleep , I 'd catch her in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went wrong with me  --  but she was getting hard-edged and bitter , my wife . Impending motherhood , being broke , two washouts as her husband , it was all too much for her . She was a frustrated woman , and she showed it . Little frown lines played around her eyes . <p> I did carpentry and urban gardening to avoid them . <p> Our baby was born in May , two weeks late . We named her April , because that 's what we 'd been calling her for nine months already and we were used to it . Two years later we had Ethan , her little brother . At this point we had to have a larger apartment , health benefits , and a baby-sitter . So l got a day job . That is , my dad got one for me . I performed high-resolution sonograms at the neonatal clinic at Mt . Sinai Hospital . All those tiny legs and arms , the baby-bracelet of a spine . After the second kid , Jeannie had gone half-time . <p> We had not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postcard or two from Mexico that waxed on rather awkwardly about the cruelty of poverty and the beauty of the sunsets . Aside from his rather pedestrian letter , these were the only examples I had ever seen of his strained and awkward prose , which resulted in some delicious schadenfreude  --  I went around the house quoting " the blushing bruise of evening " and " the paper-thin quality of money " One horrible winter evening , there was a drunken rambling phone call when he asked me for a loan , and then begged Jeannie to come back to him . It did sting a bit to hear her say : " Thanks for reminding me that I could be worse off than I am . " After that , shame must have taken hold , because Phil did not even respond to Ethan 's birth announcement , and we soon lost track of him altogether , which by that time was fine with me . He had angled for my wife . I did n't miss the guy . In fact , I started associating him with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy karma . I mean , before we 'd started hanging out , I 'd been riding high . <p> Sort of . <p> I was at work one day , reading People magazine . Tom Cruise , who I 'd worked with on Born on the Fourth of July , was on the cover . Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen ( my bunkmates in Platoon ) were featured on the inside . A girl who had given me a blowjob in a closet at a party in 1985 had just gotten her very own prime-time soap . It was a slow day at the hospital . We 'd done four amnios that morning and then nothing . Nothing but coffee from the machine and torn-up , booger-stained magazines . I flipped through the pages with a pencil . Decided to call my agent and was put on hold . I did this from time to time , called in in desperation . I held the line and read the story about the actress , Dallas Merchant . She was starring in this new show  --  the world was fashion magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd been found at a giant casting call by the show 's producer and creator , Felipe Elbazz , who she was now engaged to . <p> Phil . Our Phil ! Jeannie 's and my mutual husband . <p> There was an accompanying photo of him , bearded now ( all those guys are bearded  --  there 's a direct correlation , I 'm sure of it , between driving ambition and a weakness in chin ) , holding hands with Dallas . The caption said he had two other pilots in the can and three more series in development . The happy couple were rebuilding his house in Malibu that just last winter had been hit by a mudslide and fallen into the sea . " A mixed blessing , " said Felipe , the producer and creator . " Now there 's an excuse to buy all new art and all new furniture . " <p> I wanted to watch him bleed . <p> And for the first time in my life , I understood the saying " jumped out of his skin , " for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my lab coat . lust jumped out of it , out of my seat , out of my job ( for the afternoon ) . I told the big-haired receptionist in the lobby that I was coming down with something sniffly-the last thing all those pregnant women wanted was a technician with a cold  --  locked up the lab , and split . And then I walked home , all ninety-nine blocks , to our apartment on First Street and First Avenue . And with every middle-aged step I took , I hated myself a little more . <p> Nothing had turned out the way I 'd planned . I had no career , no dignity , no money . My wife was getting pinched . My kids were virtually underprivileged  --  April said : " Look , Daddy , the country ! " every time she saw a vacant lot . There I was , thirty-eight , practically forty , and I was not a homeowner or a car owner , I possessed no bonds nor stocks . And like many a loser before me , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , I was pretty much working for my father . Almost a decade had gone by , and I had accomplished almost nothing . What had I been doing with myself during that squandered , precious time ? <p> When I finally arrived at our apartment , footsore and blistered and halfway out of my mind , Jeannie took one look at me and ran the bath . I 'm not ashamed to say that after I stripped down and got naked , after she brought me a beer , I soaked in that hot water and cried my eyes out . Jeannie sat on the toilet waiting for the faucets to dry . She 'd never seen me like this , but later on she said it had n't frightened her . In fact , she said , even a nervous breakdown at that moment felt like a ray of hope . <p> So when I finished crying , I leaned over and pulled the People magazine out of my pants pocket off the floor . I covered my eyes while my wife read the article sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I heard her , I felt the breeze of her moving body and the palpable release of tension that came in those days whenever she left a room . And then a moment or two later , Jeannie and all her accompanying anxiety came back inside again  --  you could sense it , rippling across the bathwater . She peeled my hands back with her hands , stuck the cordless phone into my fist . <p> " Call him , " she said . " He owes us . " <p> She said , " I do n't care if you have to suck his dick . " <p> And then she sat there and monitored my efforts as naked and shivering and pitiful , I tried to track Phil down . She sat there as I rang up his mother , his office , a string of his personal assistants ; she sat there as my skin shriveled to the consistency of a prune . And I do believe she was having a rather good time of it , bearing witness , as I prostrated myself to the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool light enlivening her eyes and a nasty smile playing around her lips . <p> It had been years since I 'd made her so happy . <p> Within three weeks I had quit neonate at Sinai and I was safely ensconced in the Shangri-la Hotel in Santa Monica on a modest but adequate per diem . Phil had been delighted to hear from me , " delighted . " He 'd just written a part into the show with me in mind , he said , so we were " fated , " and the timing of my phone call could n't have been more " divine . " <p> I thanked him profusely for his largesse , and wondered what it was about L.A. that made everyone sound like a drag queen . <p> Then I packed my bags . <p> " Write , do n't call , " said Jeannie . " Get in the habit of sending child support checks . " <p> Phil sent his personal assistant to pick me up at the airport in a limo when I arrived , and a basket full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a grapefruit that rivaled a melon  --  was waiting in my hotel room . But it was n't until the next day on the set that I got a chance to see him . I waited forty-five minutes in his outer office . Finally some D-girl ushered me in . Phil was on the phone , sipping a hot latte , but he waved me inside with a wide grin , pointing broadly at his cup to see if I wanted my own coffee . <p> I mimed back no , I was fine , then instantly regretted it . <p> Even with his face bisected by a phone cord , Phil looked better than I remembered . Gone was that wan , hunched-over , defeated look that he 'd worn like a badge in the eighties . The beard , of course , helped give him definition , but his hair was nicely silvered and faded jeans hung just so from his slim hips . <p> Phil 's phone call lasted another fifteen minutes . So I awkwardly wandered the office , past the potted palm , perused stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints , and then sunk into his couch and stared at my feet on the floor . I was still wearing my hospital loafers . <p> Phil was wearing hand-stitched Italian moccasins . <p> Finally , he got off the phone . <p> " Hey , sweetheart , " said Phil , walking around the island of his desk to vigorously shake my hand . <p> " Thanks , Phil , " I said , a little too heartfeltly . " I 'm really grateful for the opportunity to work . " <p> We both looked away then , I suppose to avoid my further humiliation . <p> " How 's Jeannie ? " said Phil . <p> " Good , " I said . <p> An awkward silence . <p> Then , " Glad to hear it . And the kids ? " <p> " The kids are fine , Phil . " <p> " Dynamite , " said Phil . " Terrific " ' <p> Thank God , at that moment , the phone rang , the D-girl barged in , and with a half-blown kiss and another wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil 's office . After that brief , tortuous encounter , I rarely saw my old best friend again . He was always away in Hawaii or Aspen or holed up at his Montana ranch , and the few times he came into the studio , he was breezy and light and avoided me like the plague ; which was fine with me . In his absence , it was easier to pretend I had gotten this gig on my own merits . <p> My part was small , more of an accent , and less than a role , but it was job , a Guild job , a Guild job with benefits . t had been years since I 'd been before a camera , years since l 'd been on a set . It had been years since I ate hot Danish and cold coffee and stuffed my coat pockets with bagels from the catering table and sat around all day waiting for my three lines . I played Dallas Merchant 's exhusband . I 'd come to town as a threat to her present love interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she was editor-in-chief . I started off the season with a series of idle threats . My name was Spencer Klein  --  another half-breed like myself  --  and I 'd swooped in , ostensibly to buy the company out from under them , but really to reclaim Dallas . A cocaine habit on my part had done the marriage in . Dallas . Now that I was sober , I wanted a second chance . <p> A second chance . Is n't that what I 'd prayed for and gotten in my real life ? The weeks passed into months . The show shot up in the ratings . Phil , according to Dallas , apparently flew home on weekends , but he was busy running the world then , and except for a couple of quick phone conversations where he was sure to compliment my work  --  laying it on thick enough to make me feel like a jerk  --  I never really spoke to the guy . Meanwhile , my part grew  --  Spencer was a real prick , but also , oddly enough , a growing hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil ) by surprise . So my hours on the set got longer . I 'd been away from home for a while , and in some weird way my life in New York began to feel like it belonged to someone else . While I still spoke to the kids on the phone each night , Jeannie was avoiding me . But at the time I felt my career had to be my first priority . If I failed again , the only fallback was that lubricant-slicked sonogram wand and the small sadistic pleasures it afforded me . So I got more and more caught up with my life in L.A. I even rented a little apartment . And when I closed my eyes at night in my little beach bungalow , when I was driving with the top down and my shades up on the 4o5 , and increasingly when I was rehearsing a scene with Dallas , I was a single guy . <p> A young single guy . Under forty . Trim . Going to the gym . Running on the sand . Drinking bottled water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet with peppermint foot lotion in the private confines of her trailer . <p> Spencer was full of dirty tricks . In one episode , while masked and coming up from behind , he 'd even pushed Chip out a plate glass window of a steely thirty-five-story building . " Thank God , " Spencer comforted an innocent and grieving Dallas , " the fountain and pool were there to break his fall . " Chip was in a coma , and Dallas and I were in a clinch . On any other show , this would have made a grand season finale , but Phil was a trashmeister of the first degree , and he and his team whipped this trap up on a weekly basis . What was shocking was that the worse Spencer got , the more completely he won over the female audience . He was mean and duplicitous and sexy . " Masterful , " a mother of five from Tulsa wrote me . I even got a note from one of my former patients . " I wish I 'd known who you were when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does that count as having sex ? " And Dallas herself , one afternoon as we were reading lines , said . " You 're blowing Chip out of the water , babe . " <p> She was a good-looking woman , Dallas . Polished with the blond , gold sheen of a prime-time diva . And she took a healthy pleasure in her own reflection , which , after years of a tight-lipped , frown-lined Jeannie , had its own appeal . While Chip was in a coma , Dallas and I had to do a couple of steamy love scenes . We rehearsed a lot . On and off the set . One evening she even invited me out to their house at the beach . She said , " We 've got to crack that damn shower sequence . " But before I could drive out on the PCH that night , ready and eager to break my marriage vows , Dallas called me back . Her voice sounded a little shaky . Felipe had just rung her from New York , and after learning of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office in L.A. She 'd see me Monday on the set . <p> I took Phil 's imminent arrival as a celestial reprieve from the heinous act I had only moments ago been eager to commit . Jeannie and I may have had our problems then  --  we always have our problems  --  but I love the girl . That night I called home , eager to make amends , but the kids were left with a sitter and Jeannie was out to dinner with a " friend . " <p> " How do I spell your last name again ? " asked the sitter . <p> I hung up , went out , and got so drunk at a popular dive bar in Hollywood that in the wee hours of the morning , the bartender folded me into a taxi . <p> Phil had rewritten the next episode . When I arrived on the set , the director took one look , shoved the new script under my arm , and sent me directly into makeup . I learned my new lines as a cosmetician did her best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still in the shower , but just when they were about to make use of all that steam , Spencer was to grab his ears and fall down to the floor moaning . A cerebral hemorrhage ? Multiple personality disorder ? Dallas , naked , would rush out of the water to call an ambulance  --  the late-night adult audience would be fortunate enough to see her butt . We 'd find out what happened to me in the next episode . <p> And so it went . It seemed that Spencer suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder , thanks to the horror , the horror , of the time he 'd spent as a soldier in the jungle  --  the miniature palm trees and lush bougainvillea in Dallas 's solarium triggering his most brutal recollections . Over the next few weeks , Spencer went into a shocking decline . He was reduced to a sweaty , trembling wreck ( I was n't allowed to shave , they oiled my scalp and painted gray streaks around my temples ) , he was afraid to get off his couch , afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear like that can be contagious . For the first time in years , Oliver Stone peopled my dreams . So I was in trouble , but Spencer was worse off . First he lost his business , and then , of course , without money , he lost Dallas . Somehow she 'd gotten wind of the fact that he 'd thrown Chip out the window  --  Chip had come out of his coma and was now president of the magazine 's parent company  --  and she 'd finally seen Spencer for the bum he was . <p> I did n't like going to work anymore . My nights were sleepless , lonely , and damp , and I 'd show up in the morning all twisty and exhausted . My fan mail changed to hate mail , and the other actors seemed to avoid me . Even Dallas . I carried the stench of a canceled contract , I could even smell it on myself . Sour , rancid , cheesy . Each Monday morning when the script girl handed me my pages , I took a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , perhaps ? A car accident ? Dallas and the sexy silver pistol she carried strapped to her left thigh ? But there was no easy out for me . Instead , Spencer went back on coke , had hallucinations , lost his apartment , lived in a car , ate out of the garbage pails of fancy restaurants while Dallas and Chip dined royally inside . There was even a proposed episode where I was to be gang-raped by a posse of teenage Latinos , but thankfully the top brass at the network put a stop to it , something to do with public relations . <p> Feeling all alone , I called home and whined to Jeannie . She had been watching the series with apparent glee . The closest she got to sympathy was to say , " I keep telling Phil to either have Spencer buried alive in a coffin or saddled with cement shoes and thrown off the Santa Monica Pier . " <p> " You 've talked to Phil ? " I said . <p> " Oh , we had dinner a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " do n't you think it 's time that you and the kids moved out here ? " <p> " Why ? " said my wife . " You 're going to be out of a job in another week . " <p> I let this sink in . " Did Phil say something ? " <p> " God , " she said . " What a narcissist . We never talk about you . " And then Jeannie hung up on me . <p> That 's when I went into my desk and dug out Phil 's old letter-which I 'd kept as a souvenir . In the past , whenever I felt especially lousy about myself , the letter gave me solace . But now as I read and reread it , the opposite happened for me . The letter was the same old melodramatic mess , overwritten and self-deprecating . " And if I can manage to eke out one halfway respectable novel , even if it 's not publishable , I 'll figure my time on earth was wellspent . " But Phil was practically running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into such a huge success ? And on my watch . Off my back . Engaged to my crush . Eating dinner with my wife and actively not discussing me . <p> I talked to Dallas . That is , I took the opportunity to barge into her trailer . I came bearing that stupid letter , now crumpled and sweaty in my fist . I wanted her to see the evidence , to know Phil , the man she was engaged to . A failed novelist . A thirty-five-yearold who 'd borrowed money from his mother . A cuckold who befriended the guy who was sleeping with his wife . This was the real Phil , I was going to say with dignity , and here is the written proof . But Dallas allowed me no time for such theatrics . With my mouth barely open , I only got to flap the wrinkled paper before her like a fan . <p> " Darling , " said Dallas . <p> I flapped the letter limply . <p> Dallas was sitting at her dressing table in a blue kimono with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed-out and a little aged . She was reading the next week 's script . But before I got a chance to say a word , she gazed up at me with pity . She handed me the pages and said quietly , ' I 'll go get you a cup of tea . " Then Dallas exited her trailer , half-dressed , without the comfort of her war paint , onto the bustling set and into the crowded commissary , so I knew in my bones that disaster was probably imminent . <p> The next episode chilled my blood . According to the script , while freebasing coke  --  after prostituting myself on Hollywood and Vine to a cruising male pornographer  --  I had a little accident with the lighter . That is , I was scheduled that Monday to go up in flames , " flames flickering across his face , filling all four corners of the frame " ( Phil was a sucker for alliteration ) . I 'd wake up in the hospital with burns over ninety percent of my body . The scene notes suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moan and scream , when no one in the cast would deign to visit me  --  " What goes around comes around , " was Dallas 's line , directed to be delivered " tearfully "  --  I would survive , hideously scarred and completely crippled . At this point I would come to Chip literally on my hands and knees  --  the directions said I was to " crawl " up the walkway of his and Dallas 's house out at the beach  --  and beg for a job as a stockboy at a women 's health magazine . Chip , out of the goodness of his heart , was to stroke his beard and agree to hire me if I really could change my ways . A close-up on what used to be my face made it clear that for the life of me , I could n't . Change , that is . The directions said to focus in on my " evil eyes . " " Red-streaked and unrepentant . " " Surrounded by foamy , blistered skin hanging off in strips . " <p> My hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confront my maker . I left the set and drove out to the beach . <p> When I arrived in Malibu , Phil was sitting at his desk on a deck hanging over a dune with a heart-stopping view of the water . It was a gorgeous day , the air was dry , pressed by the sun into fragrant , soft sheets of breeze . Seagulls lounged about the sky and the ocean did a cancan across the shore , teasing and retreating , flashing a little ankle . I walked up the beachside entrance . Phil 's head was bent , and as I noted competitively , he still had a full head of hain The bastard was typing away furiously . Quadriplegia . Colostomies . Who knows what evils he was designing for my future . <p> It must have been the roar of the waves , or the low , distant rumble of the Pacific Coast Highway , or even perhaps the dynamic state of flow he probably experienced whenever he was destroying me , but Phil did not hear me approach until I was halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and picked up a decorative piece of driftwood and held it behind my back . In the other hand I carried that stupid letter . Thus armed , I continued my ascent , until Phil looked up , and rose from his seat . <p> " Sweetheart , " said Phil . <p> I handed him the letter . <p> Phil read it slowly , smiling , I suppose , when he hit the line about the novel . Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket . He said , <p> " Do you think I should have it framed ? " <p> That 's when I took the driftwood and smashed him over the head . <p> I still do n't know what possessed me . I was never a violent boy , and I 'm not a violent man . But that day at the beach , I looked at my wife 's ex-husband , a handsome , rich , successful motherfucker , positively glowing in the sun on his beachfront property , and I smashed him with a piece of his own decorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and stained his silver head . <p> For a while it was quiet . Neither of us knew what to do or say . We were shy with one another . Phil slowly brought his hand to his hair , touching blood . <p> I scuffed the wooden deck with my sneaker . <p> " I guess I need a towel , " said Phil . " And probably some ice . " He started into the house , then turned around politely . " You 're welcome to come inside . " <p> " No , " I said . " I mean , no thanks . " I said , " I think I 'd better go . " <p> " You 're sure ? " said Phil . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " I 'm sure . " And then I said sincerely , " Thanks . Thanks again , Phil , for hiring me " <p> Phil nodded generously in my direction . <p> A dribble of blood plopped down on the deck . <p> " I guess I better tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then I turned and started walking toward the staircase . <p> That 's when Phil dove , he literally dove on top of me , when my back was turned and I was walking away . The whole attack took me by surprise , but of course I should have been ready . He was a stealth bomber , Phil . This was his M.O . <p> We fell against the wood railing of his deck , which sighed and gave , then splintered and crashed , and then in a clinch we flew off the deck and through the air and down into the dunes . Rolling around , one on top of the other , like tangled pant legs in a dryer , we tumbled onto the beach . <p> We were beating the shit out of each other . <p> What can I say ? That I 'm proud of how I behaved ? I grabbed a fistful of sand and ground it against Phil 's teeth , until something cracked . I pulled back , and he spat a phlegmy , crunchy mess into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . I howled and elbowed him so hard , later we found out I 'd broken three of his ribs and even ruptured his spleen . He kicked my shin until the bone chipped , and when I bent over to grab my injured limb , Phil pummeled my back , lightly bruising my left kidney . Next my elbow fractured his eye socket . <p> We were trying our damnedest to kill each other . <p> It was a beautiful day . The sun beat down , but there was just enough wind to keep it cool , so our sweat dried faster than our blood and our skin stretched taut and cracked as if with paint . As we rolled end over end , sand glommed onto our wounds . We were bloody and wet and caked . But as I remember it now , we were n't in pain . Etherized by adrenaline , by competition , by our mutual hate , Phil and I were a tangle of braided muscle rolling toward the sea , so twisted and intertwined we were almost one man . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lapped around our edges . And there at the shore , we lay still , so close to one another I could feel Phil 's heart beating inside my chest , lending a rhythm to mine ; perhaps this alone is what saved me , because when the rescue team finally came and pulled us apart , my heart stopped , and I needed resuscitation . <p> God , did the tabloids have a field day ! And the publicity did wonders for our careers . We sued and counter-sued each other . And then about a year and a half later , after Jeannie had left and come back to me , after Dallas ran off with her new co-star and Phil got a quickie marriage to one of his PAs , we called a truce . We met at a bar on the beach , had a couple of beers , and agreed to sell the rights to our story  --  Phil was to write and to produce , and I was guaranteed a lead . Pay or play . We were once again a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had production companies and families and egos to support , and , true to form , we were each out only for ourselves . <p> But before , on that glorious day in Malibu , when we were both twisting weakly like a couple of fish on the same hook , it was Phil alone who sustained me . His breath was warm against my neck , his blood salty on my lips , or perhaps it was the brine of the ocean that I tasted , for the waves crashed close and closer still , wetting us now with sea spray . Then it was Phil and I and no one else , and I have to admit I kind of liked it that way . For we were lying halfdead in each other 's arms when the waves began to break over us , like lovers , curled up in the warm , damp bed of the sand . <p> <p> By HELEN SCHULMAN <p>
