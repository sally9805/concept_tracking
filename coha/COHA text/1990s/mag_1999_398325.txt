Section : REMEDIES Men do a lot of stupid things to heal themselves . Here 's how to make sure you do n't meet those guys in line at the emergency room <p> PLAYING DOCTOR is a blast  --  when you 're 8 years old and have a neighbor with pigtails . But practicing medicine without credentials becomes trickier as you grow older . Eventually , if you do n't wise up , it can lead you to do some screwy or downright lethal things to the worst possible guinea pig : you . We asked ER doctors and other physicians to tell us the most common and most grisly things men have done to themselves in the name of health . Perhaps you 've performed a few of these foolish acts yourself ; many are bizarre but understandable . Others  --  well , others might put you on the wrong side of Darwin 's theory . Whacking a dislocated shoulder back into place <p> " One patient who 'd seen Lethal Weapon tried to pop his shoulder back into place by banging against a wall , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an emergency physician at Harbor UCLA Medical Center . " He ended up breaking it . " If you dislocate a shoulder  --  or any other useful joint  --  go to a hospital fast . The docs will fix you up , and you 'll make friends in the waiting room . Playing ambulance driver <p> " A 2-year local study turned up about 20 cases of people who had cardiac arrest while trying to drive themselves to the hospital , " says Dr. Stratton . Most of them crashed their cars when they lost consciousness . " One guy even tried to drive his motorcycle home so his wife could drive him to the hospital , " recalls Dr. Stratton . " He crashed his bike 100 yards from his house . He lived , but he was in much worse shape after the crash . " Call 911 ; your wife ca n't defibrillate you while she 's barreling through red lights . Guzzling booze to relieve pain  --  and then driving to the ER bombed <p> This happens all the time , says Dr. Stratton . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bump on the head from tumbling off a bar stool ) and starts swigging vodka to numb the pain . Then , when the agony does n't subside , he realizes he 's badly wounded , so he crawls to his pickup and speeds to the ER . These guys do n't always make it , says Dr. Stratton . Neither do the folks in the crosswalk . Drowning a cold in hot toddies <p> Alcohol does n't do anything to fight a cold or flu , says Cynthia Aaron , M.D. , of the University of Massachusetts hospital . " It just makes you drunk so you do n't feel as sick . " Swap your hooch for water or juice . Double-dipping on Viagra <p> " People tend to feel that if taking one Viagra pill works , taking four or five will work even better , " says Dr. Aaron . " One man who did this recently ended up in the operating room with priapism , or a prolonged erection , which nearly damaged his penis . " ( And he wasted $50 worth of sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 milligram ( mg ) or 100 mg Viagra pills , never take more than your doctor prescribed , or your next erection might be your last . Lancing pimples <p> We 've all sterilized a needle in a flame and used it to jab a pimple or boil ; it 's a teenage hobby . But you 're an adult now , so let your eruptions heal by themselves . The needle can push surface bacteria deep into the skin and cause a nasty infection , says Dr. Romano , a dermatologist at New York Hospital . Also , the burning match puts carbon fibers on the needle , and this can leave a black " carbon tattoo " on your face that will last for months . No one will believe you when you call it body art . Slicing off warts , moles , and skin flaps <p> Self-surgery almost always leads to infection , because your scalpel is n't sterile . ( A flame or alcohol dousing rarely kills all bacteria . ) And since you wo n't remove the root of the growth , it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirkpatrick , M.D. , emergency physician at Knollwood Park Hospital in Mobile , Alabama . Finally , you might be nicking off a cancerous growth and leaving malignant cells behind . " You have no way of knowing if you 're dealing with a simple skin flap or melanoma , " says Dr. Kirkpatrick . Let a doctor make that call . Pouring peroxide on cuts <p> " People pour hydrogen peroxide into wounds as if it were the elixir of the gods , and the bubbling convinces them it 's working , " says Eric A. Weiss , M.D. , of Stanford University 's medical center . " But it can injure blood vessels and healthy tissue . " Instead , clean out the wound with water and apply an antibacterial ointment so it wo n't scab over ; scabs delay healing . If a minor cut wo n't stop bleeding quickly , slap a wet teabag on it , suggests Dr. Weiss . Tannic acid constricts blood vessels . Do n't use the bag to make tea afterward . Fishing grit out of your eye with a napkin <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Dr. Weiss . " The corner of a napkin or a paper towel can be very sharp , and you could give your cornea a paper cut . " To avoid a lifetime of pirate jokes , flush your eye with water to remove an irritant . Fill a small plastic bag with water and puncture the corner with a pin , he suggests . Hold the bag above your head while you 're leaning over a sink , and use the water stream to wash your eye . Or , if you can see the object , gently remove it with a wet Q-Tip . <p> To ease the irritation you feel after removing a speck , squeeze a few drops from a wet , nonherbal teabag into your eye , says Dr. Weiss . ( The folks at Lipton must love him . ) The tannic acid in the tea will help ease the redness and tearing . Using a turkey baster to cure gonorrhea <p> An old folklore remedy claims that shooting carbonated water or alcohol into the urethra can cure gonorrhea , says Dr. Stratton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I 've seen this trick cause scarring and penile damage , " he says . Worse , the dolts who try this probably use the same baster for the Thanksgiving turkey . Putting mud on a bee sting <p> A cool handful of muck can ease the pain , but it also contaminates the tiny puncture wound . " One man was stung by a bee out in the woods , so he urinated on some dirt and made mud , which he used to cover the sting , " says Dr. Stratton . " Naturally , the sting became infected . " <p> After you scrape out the stinger with the edge of a credit card ( do n't squeeze it ; you 'll just force more venom into the wound ) , douse the stung area with cold water , take an aspirin , and  --  if it 's handy  --  spray antiperspirant , ammonia , or an antihistamine like Benadryl on the sting . All contain chemicals that can neutralize the venom . Yanking darts , knives , nails , or tent stakes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp object , anywhere in your body , let a doctor remove it . Case in point : A woman in Los Angeles was cutting steak when her boyfriend startled her , and she accidentally ( that 's what she claimed , anyway ) stabbed him in the chest , burying the knife to the hilt . She called 911 , and before the operator could tell her to leave the knife in , he yanked out the blade and began bleeding severely . " He died , and he probably would n't have if he had left the knife inside his chest , " says Dr. Stratton . The knife had been acting as a cork . Basting a burn <p> A dollop of mustard , mayonnaise , or guacamole initially cools a burn , but it also introduces bacteria . " The parent of one 12-year-old coated a burn on the girl 's hand with mustard . It became infected , and that probably cost her the partial use of her hand , " says Larry L. Alexander , M.D. , of Baylor Medical Center in Dallas . Cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin disinfectant <p> One pathetic knave we know admits that he poured Clorox on his penis after a teenage tryst , hoping to avoid an STD . ( We 're afraid to ask what plan B was . ) Not surprisingly , the bleach dousing caused a painful chemical burn . If it 's any consolation , he would n't be alone in a support group . " People often pour Clorox on injuries and rashes , thinking it 's going to kill germs , " says John Romano , M.D. " Usually it just causes irritation . " Stick with soap and water  --  and people you know . Super-gluing a gash <p> People see doctors using DermaBond ( a sterile , medical super-glue ) to close small wounds , says Dr. O'Brien , so they copy the idea . " I 've seen people use hardware super-glue to close cuts , " he says . But store-bought glues are made to bond hard hats to steel girders ; they 're not made for medical use . They can contain bacteria , splinters , and other contaminants , Dr. O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steak on a black eye <p> The rib-eye remedy is a standard old wive 's tale , according to Richard O'Brien , M.D. , of the American College of Emergency Physicians . " Meat is full of bacteria that can give you conjunctivitis . " A cold compress will relieve the pain and swelling more effectively . If you detect any vision changes after the injury , head to an emergency room , says Dr. O'Brien . And next time , duck . Shoving objects into your ear to scour out wax <p> Nobody ever heeds the elbow adage . " People are always sticking pencils , paper clips , and keys in their ears , " says Dr. Weiss . " This damages the ear canal and makes it more susceptible to infection . " In fact , the British Medical Journal reports that a 26-year-old lad gave himself a phosphorus infection by digging into his ears with " strike anywhere " matches . God intended you to probe your ear with one thing : your finger . Notice how it ca n't slip in far enough to injure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put a few drops of mineral oil in your ear to help ease it out , says Dr. Weiss . A mixture of vinegar and rubbing alcohol can fight a swimmer's-ear infection . THE SORE WINNERS Seven stunts almost too idiotic to believe " Can I have my string back ? " <p> " I had a patient who was walking very uncomfortably , " says Manuel Patino , M.D. , an Atlanta general practitioner . Turns out he had treated his hemorrhoids by tying them tightly with a string . He hoped to cut off their bloodflow , but all he did was aggravate the swelling . " By the time I saw him , he had had them tied for 3 or 4 days , " says Dr. Patino . First aid by Dilbert <p> " One man developed a severe infection after he closed his cut with a desk stapler , " says Sam Stratton , M.D. The backup plan was an iron <p> " I once treated an older guy who thought his penis was looking a little old and wrinkled , " recalls John Romano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He applied Retin-A cream to his penis , which caused the skin to shed . " It burned him so badly , it looked as if he had undergone a chemical peel , " says Dr. Romano . His painfully raw , irritated penis did , however , look remarkably like Joan Rivers . Here , Sparky ! <p> " I was a physician for a wilderness expedition when a man was bitten by a snake , " says Eric A. Weiss , M.D. Unfortunately , the man 's pals had read that electric shocks could neutralize snake venom . " They repeatedly shocked him with their stun guns , " recalls Dr. Weiss . Not only was this a humiliating insult to endure after being chomped by a reptile , it was of no medical benefit . Luckily , the man survived both attacks . A few of his buddies probably knew that he needed to go to a hospital , but just how often do you get to use your stun gun ? Vegetable oil works for us <p> A man in Atlanta was horrified to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , after having a painful erection for about 18 hours , he dragged his sore , swollen sausage to an ER . " We had to use bolt cutters to remove the ring , " says Frank Rasler , M.D. , emergency physician at DeKalb Medical Center . " He should recover enough to have sex again , but he wo n't be able to maintain erections as long . " Keep all jewelry above the waist . Now that 's comedy ! <p> A persistent Georgian was determined to remove his stuck contact lens , so he kept tugging at the transparent film on his eye . " Unfortunately , the contact lens had fallen out , so he 'd actually been pulling on his own eyeball for about a day , " says Dr. Rasler . Anal retentive <p> " One patient was bleeding from the rectum , and instead of going in for treatment  --  God knows where he got this idea  --  he used a plug to try to stop the bleeding , " says Larry L. Alexander , M.D. By the time he finally decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectal ulcer .
