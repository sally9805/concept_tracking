<p> THE liberation of Kuwait has barely begun . The emir can not rule the new Kuwait as he did the old ; the opposition wants change and is prepared to demand it . The emir can allow such opposition , as well as an elected assembly - or he can impose an authoritarian solution . Though he leans to the latter , he would be wise to consider the former . <p> The present crisis solidified Kuwaiti opposition as never before . In the past , Kuwait 's oil wealth enabled the emir to buy off dissent . Kuwait did have an elected National Assembly , and was one of the more politically open states in the region . It had a relatively free press and a real Assembly elected by a small ( adult male citizens ) but not trivial electorate . <p> Those who dominated the assembly were not the historical elite but ordinary Kuwaitis who benefited from the state 's generous welfare system . The historic opposition , the merchants on whom the emir relied for money in the lean pre-oil years , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money the emir sent their way . <p> In the year before the Iraqi invasion , Kuwait 's political dynamic began to change . In 1988 the emir suspended the Assembly . In 1989 members of this dissolved Assembly began organizing the Constitutional Movement , calling for reinstitution of the Assembly and the suspended 1962 constitution . They were joined by the merchants , alienated by the ruler 's inability to adhere to the political buyout agreement due to the 1986 fall in oil prices . The merchants ' extraordinary return to politics unified the opposition and prompted the emir to hold June 1990 elections for a compromise part-elected , part-appointed National Council . <p> The invasion prompted the opposition to regroup in exile and petition the emir for greater democracy in restored Kuwait . The showdown came in October when the ruler met with 1,200 opposition leaders and publicly promised liberalization following liberation . The elite opposition , however , had finally unified just as it was losing its popular base to the resistance groups inside Kuwait . The Kuwaitis who had spent months fighting the occupation had little need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile . To them , the exile opposition leaders had become figures as distant as the emir . These divisions surfaced after the war as food rotted in warehouses while resistance leaders argued with old officials over the right to feed people . The opposition , so briefly united , redivided . <p> This was the moment for the emir to break off negotiations over gold bathroom fixtures and return to Kuwait with the armies of liberation , kiss the ground , make new promises , then stand above factions and appeal to the natural desire of a population tired of war . The prodemocracy movement might have been scuttled and a benign authoritarianism reimposed . <p> Instead , he clutched . Whether for personal reasons , from exaggerated concern for al-Sabah interests , or from the ineptitude of ruling classes that is as common as it is inexplicable , the emir hesitated . Thus he legitimized the opposition . He unwittingly forged a united prodemocratic front that could now challenge him . <p> Challengers are : <p> * The merchants . Historically , the most important opposition group . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hibernation but are active again . They form the liberal constitutionalist opposition along with " the technocrats . " <p> * The technocrats . Often children of merchants , they established a political beachhead in the bureaucracy before the invasion and reestablished one in the reconstruction administration . They support prodemocracy but are in an adminstrative turf battle with " the resistance . " <p> * The resistance . These include both organizers of the underground food distribution networks and the more militant Islamist opposition that emerged in the mosques under occupation . Kuwaitis who survived the occupation remain loyal to the resistance . Their sense of entitlement from suffering at the hands of the Iraqis is powerful but amorphous . Surprisingly diverse in their religious , economic , political , and legal status , their political allegiances are fragile . Minor actors in the coming confrontation include : <p> * The national population outside of Kuwait . Divided between those anxious to return and those prepared to wait , those reliant on state stipends and those with their own money , they can not present a unified position . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economically , and politically diverse , nonnationals have never formed a political bloc . Most wanted merely to save money and return home quickly . Now divided between those who opposed Iraq and those who did not , they pose no unified threat . Their energy will be dissipated by individual efforts to cut a deal and stay . <p> Against this array of forces stands the emir , backed only by his family , the al-Sabahs , historically a weak group which only gained importance after the growth of a state bureaucracy forced the ruler to turn trusted relatives into loyal staff . Today the family holds most key cabinet posts . <p> The emir 's best chance for survival may lie in negotiation with the opposition he helped unify . He needs to form a unity cabinet with merchants , technocrats , Islamist resistance leaders , and al-Sabahs , and set an election date . By institutionalizing the opposition he can coopt it and implicate its leaders in the difficult austerity measures Kuwait must adopt . If he attempts to crush the opposition , the new government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolios , expansion of the internal security apparatus , and the increasing redefinition of politcal problems ( population policy , privatization ) as technical problems for planners , not parliamentarians . <p> This is the most dangerous trend . The efficacy of the democratic impulse lies less in the strength of Kuwait 's participatory institutions than in the weakness of its authoritarian institutions . If these are allowed to grow unchecked , the prodemocratic forces will never win . Now unchecked by either bureaucratic or representative bodies , the security apparatus , historically weak in Kuwait , will do anything - hold food at the borders , bury oil firefighters in paperwork - to stay in power . This is particularly a danger in Kuwait today as the security apparatus now stands . <p> This is a problem for Kuwaitis to solve . The United States , however , can help by reiterating its support for the prodemocratic forces and by communicating this to the emir as he wavers between liberalization and authoritarianism . <p> We should see Kuwait as an opportunity , a chance to break with the past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who supported the war must be equally supportive of the peace . Those who opposed it must resist the temptation to gloat over emerging antidemocratic tendencies and instead help halt them . <p> Democracy may not have been the reason we supported Kuwait in the past , but it should be the reason we support its continuing liberation in the future . And the emir needs to know this .
