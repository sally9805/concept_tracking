Scissors Cut Paper , Paper Covers Schlock <p> " If Stephen King , John Grisham , and Michael Crichton got together , they 'd become one of the top three publishers overnight . " - Morgan Entrekin , publisher for Grove Press , quoted in The New Yorker , 10/6/97 . SWEATING despite the cool recirculated air , his nervous stomach spasming , his lanky shock-cushioned body nearly folded in half around various struts and controls , Michael Crichton IV rolled into the luxurious boardroom of KGC Publishing , secure in the cramped interior of his armored trundlebug . This model , equipped with a wide range of sensors , weapons , and defenses , was the same one used by the troops of such protectorates as MicrosoftSnapple and Harvard-Sam Adams . Nothing short of an illegal quantum-disruptor could penetrate this heavy carapace . With the announcement Crichton IV intended to make today , he knew he 'd need every ounce of shielding . No one could be counted on to react more fiercely than partners betrayed . Not that Crichton IV 's confederates were especially pleasant even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dayto-day management of KGC involved too many violent emotions , too many bruised artistic sensibilities . Literary trespassing and poaching , even if unintentional , on what the partners deemed their personal territories raised hackles and frequently brought down massive internecine firepower . This was the forty-second headquarters they had gone through in the nearly one hundred years of their existence - and it certainly would n't be the last . Assuming KGC even continued to exist after today . Crichton IV tracked his vehicle around the teak conference table and into a power position from which he could monitor the entrance to the boardroom . Calling this meeting for ten A.M. , he had deliberately arrived before the others so as to secure the most advantageous spot . One of the building 's load-bearing beams ran directly above him , and he hoped it might serve to protect him from the eventual falling debris . Now on his monitors Crichton IV saw his partners arrive , concealed in their own armored carriers . Deliberately built only wide enough for one vehicle at a time , the boardroom door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen King VI and John Grisham III jostled for precedence , with King VI eventually winning . Crichton IV was n't surprised : King VI was as daring and impulsive as all of his identical ancestors , taking risks the other partners shied away from . That was why there had been six of him , though , compared to four Crichtons and three Grishams . Now on two of Crichton IV 's screens popped up the images of his partners . Neither of them looked very happy . " You 'd better have a damn good reason for making me haul my ass away from my studio this early in the moming , " said King VI . " I barely got fifty pages written since breakfast . " " l concur , " said Grisham III . " We might have the basis of a suit or at least an actionable tort here . Scribendi interruptus . " Beating around the bush would n't make the fateful words any easier to say . - Crichton IV cleared his throat with a rasping sound and uttered the deadly sentence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouts of belligerent hell-energy erupted from the oneman tanks of his partners , setting off coruscating force-shield reactions amongst all three . Instantly , the walls of the boardroom were reduced to atoms , opening the suite to the cool air two hundred meters above ground level . The ceiling was partially evaporated , along with a good-sized chunk of the seven remaining floors above , and a radiant flare shot out from the top of the KGC building , as if signaling construction crews to begin pouring the foundations for HQ number forty-three . Thank god I gave the publicity department the day off , Crichton IV thought . Luckily , the floor of the boardroom was reinforced with the same material used in the Quito Beanstalk , so the partners did not plunge to the basement . Instead , they remained in place for the downfall of debris that quickly followed the spectacular attack . And , as Crichton IV had foreseen , King VI and Grisham III were buried , while he was protected by a truncated portion of the building 's structural components . Quickly , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trundlebug over to the junkpiles and extruded two metal tentacles which burrowed down intelligently to the immobilized vehicles , clamped on , and administered a paralyzing surge that fried their electronics . Into the defenseless tanks , the tentacles next insinuated audiovideo feeds under the control of an exultant Crichton IV . The shaken but unharmed faces of King VI and Grisham III reappeared on his screens . " Okay , you two - now you 're going to listen to me . " His partners scowled , but acquiesced , having no choice in the matter . " I said I wanted to resign , and you two immediately assumed I was joining another firm , a rival . " " Well , what else would we think ! " King VI shouted . " That has to be what you 're up to ! " " Who is it ? " queried Grisham III in his coolest prosecutorial tones . " Clancy , Koontz , and Steel ? No ? Do n't tell me you 're still entertaining those laughable literary pretensions you once had . You 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in a million years . Or are you finally affirming your genre roots ? Did you cut a deal with Bear , Benford , Brin , Baxter , and Egan ? " " None of those . I 'm striking out on my own . " King VI laughed harshly . " You fool ! You 'll lose all the synergy of our partnership , all the economies of scale . Your rackspace in the protectorate retail outlets wo n't be guaranteed anymore . Your brandname will sink like a stone . " " I 'm retiring not just from publishing as we currently practice it , but from writing as well , " Crichton IV announced . This unbelievable statement shocked his soon-to-beex-partners into silence . " I think the Crichton lineage has said all it can say over the past century . I also think the same is true for all the rest of us amalgamated , incorporated writers . But of course that 's a recognition I leave each individual to reach on his own . No , I plan to embark on a new venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **29;1453;TOOLONG publisher . " An even deeper stunned silence greeted this announcement , until finally Grisham III found his tongue . " You mean , soliciting manuscripts from non-commodified , even previously unpublished writers and printing small and medium-sized quantities of an extensive number of titles twice a year , risking your own money while trusting the marketplace to discriminate between good books and bad ? " " Precisely . " " You 're bughouse ! " exclaimed King VI . " Not at all . It 's the only way out of the stagnant , uncreative pool we 're drowning in . The only books that see print nowadays are predigested , by-the-numbers , focusgroup-approved rehashes of past bestsellers . We 've killed the vital kind of fiction that once existed . Face it , gentlemen  --  we 're dinosaurs squashing the life out of the very field we profess to love . " King VI snorted . " Shoulda known the dinosaurs would come into this somehow . " Grisham III spoke . " How do we know this , ahem , disclosure is not some roundabout way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that this is not an underhanded plot ? ' " " I 'm not joining Pynchon , DeLillo , and Erickson , believe me . " " It 's a sob story , " said King VI . " He 's just angling for a bigger share of the profits . " " And I 'm not joining Krantz , Collins , and Pilcher either . No , I 'm telling you the simple truth . I 'm going to start an old-fashioned publishing firm , one that does n't even bear my name . I 'm thinking of calling it Andromeda Publishing . Our motto will be : " A new strain of books . " " " Well , in that case , if you do n't need your name , we 'll just clone you again . I 'm sure Crichton V will see things our way . " Crichton IV smiled . " You forget , gentlemen , the medical training associated with my lineage . I 've secured all my cell-samples from the corporate vaults , and incinerated my living quarters . There 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem , not the solution . " Finally admitting defeat , the two abandoned partners addressed each other . " I suppose we 'll just have to merge with some other hacks in order to compete . " " The mystery field has been having a good year . Let me initiate negotiations with Leonard , Hiassen , Burke , Vachss , and Westlake . " Satisfied that he could now take his leave safely and embark on realizing his new dreams , Crichton IV began to reel in his audiovideo taps , but was brought up short by a shout from King VI . " Hey , Mikey ! " " Yes ? " " Uh , would you read something by a friend of mine named Richard Bachman ? " "
