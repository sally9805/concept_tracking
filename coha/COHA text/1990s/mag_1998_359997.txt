When a single day 's batch of mail includes a letter from one reader who tells us how much she " adores Joel Stein 's celebrity interviews " and another from a reader who thinks Stein is " the nastiest , bitchiest , sleaziest little rat ever to scoot around the halls of TIME , " you know you 've got one provocative writer on your hands . <P> From the moment he debuted as the writer of the People section , on Nov. 3 , 1997 , we noticed an uptick in mail about what was already one of the magazine 's best-read pages . More than that , it was the beginning of an intractable love-hate relationship . Was Stein " the best thing to happen to TIME , " or had the People page " become prisoner to his maniacal destructiveness " ? Was he " wacky and fun " or " flat-out obnoxious " ? Even as a sportswriter , a role he has taken up recently , Stein continues to attract both cheers ( " What brilliant commentary ! " ) and catcalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Pepto-Bismol " ) . To help us  --  and you  --  better understand this controversial phenom on our roster , we decided to turn the tables and pose our readers ' queries to him directly . <P> Q + A JOEL STEIN <P> Q : How should we answer the reader who asked , " Just how puerile can a columnist get ? " <P> A : Real puerile . But I 've got to look up the meaning of that word . <P> Q : We think you look pretty normal , so why do you think anyone would call you " a journalistic mosquito " ? <P> A : Why do readers write better than I ? A " journalistic mosquito " ? That 's great ! If I were a rapper , I 'd go by that name . <P> Q : A reader suggested that the time has come for an all-Joel magazine , the Stein Journal . If there were such a beast , what would its focus be ? <P> A : It would be all about me and my exciting life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints for better flower arrangements . The last page would be a column on my childhood memories . Oh , and yeah , every once in a while , I 'd fire my whole staff . <P> Q : One reader wants to know why anyone would agree to an interview with you after seeing what you 've done . What 's up with that ? <P> A : What is up with that ? Only one person has ever refused an interview . Publicists try to get me to interview their people , even though they know what they 're in for . I guess they 're sick of the normal questions and are looking for some puerile stuff . <P> Q : When readers tell us they are amazed and astounded by the " utter lack of redeeming qualities " in your column , what should we reply ? <P> A : What kind of " redeeming qualities " would anyone look for in a Q + A ? That 's like saying I feel empty and alone after reading INSTYLE . <P> Q : We 've been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kind of material . He 's huge ! " Does that make you feel like a big deal ? <P> A : Yeah , sure . TIME 's whole flyer policy made me feel large . As soon as I found out about it , my life changed . <P> Q : Did your mom write that letter ? <P> A : Yes , she did .
