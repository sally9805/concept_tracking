Once , during a football game between the Ventura County ( Calif . ) Cardinals and the Burbank Bandits , Bob Blechen was pursuing a ballcarrier when he was laid out by a vicious hit . " A perfect blindside , " Blechen says appreciatively . " He just cleaned me off my feet . " // In rough-and-tumble semipro football , such a hit is cause for celebration , but in this instance players from both teams quickly gathered around Blechen and looked down in concern . // " You O.K. ? " // " Fine , thanks , " said Blechen , looking up and lying . // " I felt horrible , " says the 285-pound Blechen , " but you ca n't have people treating you differently because of your age . " // Blechen was 59 at the time . On Oct. 12 he turned 61 , which makes him the oldest tackle football player in the U.S. // Blechen , who lives in Agoura Hills , Calif. , is not a cameo player or a kicker . He starts at offensive tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 grandchildren and has been playing football nearly nonstop for five decades . " People often think I 'm the coach , " he says . // Bo Brooks , 14 years Blechen 's junior and his coach when Blechen played with the Cardinals , remembers when he first met the older man . " I played across the line from this defensive tackle who was big , strong and tough , " says Brooks . " When he took his helmet off after the game , I was in shock . He was a gray-haired old man . That was in 1978. " // Such a man must be supremely gifted . Well , Blechen was drafted as an offensive lineman by the Detroit Lions in 1956 but did n't make the final cut , a decision that surprised him . " I was too small and too slow , " Blechen says . " I thought I 'd be cut a lot sooner . " Indeed , George Allen , Blechen 's coach at Whittier College from 1953 to ' 55 , once said Blechen ran " like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood bout with polio had taken away Blechen 's speed . // To compete in the semiprofessional American Football Association against players not even half his age , Blechen must adhere to a rigorous fitness regimen , must n't he ? " Ummm , no , " he says . Exercise regularly ? " Not really . " Any training at all ? " I do get into the weight room several times a year . " // Time has bestowed on Blechen its inevitable rewards . Now he is not only slow but also old . In compensation , Blechen possesses considerable savvy and immeasurable enthusiasm . Though Allen was n't wowed by Blechen 's physical gifts , he did proclaim Blechen the smartest player he ever coached . Blechen demonstrated his intelligence throughout his working life ( which he spent as an administrator with several high-tech firms ) by saying nothing to his employers about his extracurricular interest . " Why let them know I was crazy ? " he says . // A semipro team typically plays eight to 10 games a season , but Blechen often plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday morning and a tackle game that afternoon . He has been known to finish a season in one semipro league , then promptly hop to another team in another league . // Except for two knee surgeries and some lower-back pain , Blechen remains remarkably unscathed after 44 years in the trenches . In fact his body seems to operate outside the normal physiological constraints . A year ago family members took a tape measure to him and found that he had grown almost an inch . " The next time I had my driver 's license renewed , " Blechen says , grinning , " I had my height changed from 6 ' 4 " to 6 ' 5 " . // He has outlasted players . He has outlasted teams . Perhaps fearing that he might outlast the game itself , in 1990 the American Football Association ignored league policy and made Blechen its first active Hall of Famer. // Blechen says that he is not concerned about winning honors . He just wants to play . And at no time does he move faster than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last season a shortage of players forced the Cardinals to go belly-up , and in mid-October Blechen found himself without a team . In less than two weeks he had signed on with the Falcons . // His new coach , Nolan ( Hawk ) Warren , was happy to have him onboard . " I liked him immediately because of his attitude , " says Warren , who is 60 . " Plus , now I have an older man I can talk to . " // Blechen was n't worried when the Cardinals folded . " If I had n't been able to finish out last season , it would have been O.K. , " he says . " I knew I was going to come back to play this year . "
