Anne and Nelson Raymond are role models for us all . The couple-he the police chief and she a school administrator on early retirement-from Asbestos , Quebec , have an unquenchable passion for skiing . Skiing is almost like a religion to us , " Anne wrote to SKIING . However , raising three children on government salaries , they never had big bucks to sink into the sport . In fact , they spent years on a local ski hill with one rope tow and four slopes . where a family season pass , back in the ' ' 60s , was $35 . But after attending three friends ' funerals within a week ( one of whom died just before he was scheduled to retire ) , the Raymonds started accumulating vacation time and socking away enough cash for a three-month ski trip to the Canadian and American West two seasons ago . Astonishingly , they managed to travel at an average cost of US$90 per day , even less than they had originally planned . They read " Turns on a Dime " ( SKIING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for skiing on the cheap and spoke directly to a couple like the Raymonds , whose children are grown but whose budget is still modest . Last winter , they-we 'd like to think partly inspired by our articleembarked on another dream trip , to California . Here 's how they did both trips . First , they joined organizations that provide savings on lodgings . They recommend two travel clubs , the Evergreen Bed and Breakfast Club ( 815-456-3111 ) , for people over 50 , and the Affordable Travel Club . for people over 40 ( 206-858-2172 ) . whose members accommodate other member-travelers in their homes . A club rule is that a $20 per night " gratuity " be left with the hosts for each night 's stay . In Crested Butte , Colorado , they stayed with " a couple of 70-year-old Evergreeners , " wrote Anne . " Nothing can keep these people from the slopes . They and their friends ski the double diamonds every day . " They also signed up with the Canadian equivalents of the American Automobile Association ( refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retired Persons ( 800-424-3410 ) . " We stayed at Motel 6 at Mammoth , California , which gives a 10-percent discount to members of one of the organizations we had joined , " Anne reported . " We were minutes away from the mountain , and a free ski shuttle picked us up in front of the motel and left off us in front of the ticket window . " To minimize transportation costs , the Raymonds covered their 1995-96 itinerary via a 20.000-mile road trip , using their ' ' 89 Volkswagen Jetta because it was more economical than their Jeep . They spent $500 on gas but did require several repair jobs along the way , including a burned-out throttle cable that left them stranded in Revelstoke , British Columbia , for four days , with the meter on their rental apartment at Whistler already running . Such problems were not unexpected in light of the car 's age and the demands of mountain driving . Still , they felt the Jetta 's comfort and precise handling , as well as its fuel consumption , justified their decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triptiks ( customized route finders ) and guidebooks that " became our bibles as we traveled from state to state . " The Raymonds also discovered Entertainment Publications ( 800-3744464 ) , which publishes regional and local books of savings on lodging , meals , attractions , and other travel costs . Using one of these coupons , they were able to spend " several days at a lovely hotel in downtown Banff " for just $20 per night . Just once , they slipped up , discovering after they had already checked into a California motel that it was listed in the Entertainment book . " The rule is that you show your card upon registration in order to claim the discount , " Anne recalled . However , they were lucky . " The next morning , as we had complimentary muffins and coffee in the lobby , I asked what the discount was for Entertainment members , as I had my card but had forgotten to show it , " she reported . " The desk clerk immediately said , " Oh , you 're a member . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . " To save on skiing , they bought multiday lift tickets ; pulled coupons from the Entertainment books ; took advantage of every two-for-one , ladies day , or other special offers they stumbled upon ; and joined the Over the Hill Gang ( 719-6854656 ) , whose members get bargain tickets at many ski areas . When accommodations had kitchen facilities , they always cooked their own meals . When they stayed in lodgings that included continental breakfast , they took full advantage of it . And for dining out , they eschewed expensive restaurants , selecting instead family restaurants and supermarkets , where they often bought hot meals from the deli counter . On their initial trip , the Raymonds spent their first month in Canada , skiing the Banff/Lake Louise areas for five days before continuing on to Whistler and Blackcomb . They hooked up with mountain hosts and " always came away with the feeling that , even though we were perfect strangers to them , these people cared about us . " Their second month was California dreamin ' come true . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We spent 30 days in that state and had 30 days of sunshine . " They skied their way around Lake Tahoe and also found time for detours to the Bay Area , Los Angeles , and San Diego . Then it was off to Utah and Colorado for a month , before returning to Quebec . " Nelson , a police officer , let his hair and beard grow long , " wrote Anne . " He blended in with the locals in the ski towns we visited . " So successful was this odyssey , and so enchanted were they with California skiing , that they returned to the state in January 1997-and once again , Anne wrote to tell as about it . The Raymonds flew to southern California to visit friends and found a $48 air ticket to Reno , from which they took the Lake Tahoe Casino Express ( $30 round-trip ) to South Lake Tahoe . Nelson minded the bags at Harveys while Anne prowled around on foot for a budget motel . She found the nearby Riviera Inn . a clean motel " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was soon able to negotiate down to $23.94 because they were staying longer than a week . They used free shuttles to get to Heavenly and Sierra-at-Tahoe and $2-$3 shuttles to Kirkwood , Diamond Peak , Ski Homewood , Mt . Rose , Alpine Meadows , Squaw Valley , and Northstar . " This vacation has been so economical , " wrote Anne on her Days Inn stationery , " that we plan to do it again for a month next year . " -C . W. <p>
