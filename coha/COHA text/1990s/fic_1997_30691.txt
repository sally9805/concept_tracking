Chapter OneProsperity , Washington Territory August 2 , 1877 The noose lay heavy around Jolie McKibben 's neck , smelling of sweat and horseflesh and hemp . Frantic protests of innocence had long since rendered her throat too raw to speak , and she felt nothing except a certain defiant numbness as she stared back at those who had gathered to see her hanged . Her blue-green eyes were dry and hot , but a tiny stream of perspiration trickled between her breasts , like a tear gone astray . She stood in the bed of Hobb Jackson 's hay wagon , her fair hair sticking to her scalp under the dusty bowler hat she wore , her wrists bound tightly behind her back , her chin at the most obstinate angle possible . She could hear the team of horses behind her , neighing and blowing impatiently in the slow heat of a summer morning . In another few moments , the marshal would give the signal , the horses would pull the rig from beneath her feet , and she would be left to dangle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she 'd had the bad judgment to fall in with Blake Kingston . It did n't seem just that she had to die for what he 'd done , but then , Jolie had never known life to be fair . For her , it had been a struggle , right from the very first . The undertaker , a heavy man sweating in a dark suit , dried his brow with a handkerchief and raised his round face to look into Jolie 's eyes . " Let 's get this over with , " he said . " Miss McKibben 's been duly tried and sentenced and there 's no sense in dragging things out . " Jolie felt her knees go weak and tried to put the starch back into them by sheer force of will . " I did n't rob the bank , " she croaked out , needing to say the words one last time even though they 'd been falling on deaf ears for a month . " And I did n't shoot anybody , either . " " Just hang her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big man came out of the mercantile , a flour sack over one thick shoulder , his face hidden by the brim of a large , stained hat . He wore plain brown trousers , a rough-spun shirt the color of buttery cream , and an old buckskin vest . He silenced the yammering spectators just by sweeping them up in a single scathing glance , then set the bag on the wooden sidewalk with an unhurried motion and came down the steps . He crossed a street paved in mud , manure , and sawdust and stood at the rear of the wagon . " Now , Dan'l , " fretted the wizened old marshal , " do n't you go interferin ' in this here hangin ' . We done tried this woman right and proper , and we found her guilty . " Daniel . Jolie 's heart gave a surging thump , but she could n't afford to hope for rescue . The disappointment would be another burden , and the load she carried was already crushing . The farmer swept off his hat , revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her with eyes the same shade of blue as a summer sky in the early morning . He was not handsome , this man , and yet something wrenched painfully inside Jolie as she regarded him . " This the lady bank robber ? " he asked , his low voice revealing none of the agitation that raised an invisible charge from the small mob gathered to view the proceedings . Jolie ran the tip of her tongue over dry , cracked lips . For reasons she could n't begin to sort through , it was crucial that this particular man not walk away believing she was guilty of robbery and murder . She took a step forward , and the rope chafed the delicate skin of her throat . " Does n't look like the type to me , " Daniel reflected , raising one brawny hand to rub a clean-shaven chin . Desperate to find something to focus on other than the grim realities , Jolie took note of the fact that he was the only male present who did n't sport a mustache , a beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting nearby , with the name Philias Pribbenow stenciled on the side-waddled forward , mopping his nape with the kerchief . " If you were interested in the proceedings , Daniel , " he said , " you should have shown it before now . The time for arguments and consideration is past . " Judge Chilver , a man with red-rimmed eyes and skin that seemed too loose for his face , stepped forward , a little smirk curving his lips . " ' Course , there is the weddin ' ordinance , " he said , pushing back his coat to tuck his thumbs into the pockets of a food-spotted brocade vest . He scanned the impatient lookers-on before fixing another unctuous smile on Daniel and cocking a thumb toward Jolie . " You marry the lady and we 'll call off the hangin ' . Have no choice but to string her up if she breaks the law again , o ' course . " Another man , this one young and darkly handsome , wearing black trousers , a matching vest , and a gambler 's ruffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lone Wolf Saloon . " I think Beckham should cover what Jolie McKibben stole from the bank , too , if she 's going to be his wife . " There was a general murmur of agreement at this , and Jolie did n't dare breathe as she watched Daniel 's jaw tighten . He muttered a curse and slapped his dusty hat against a solid thigh . " It would n't be right , " he said , narrowing his eyes as he gave the prisoner a swift inspection , " hanging a woman . You 'd better send her on up to Spokane and let the territorial court handle the trial . " Until moments before , Jolie would have sworn she 'd cried out all her tears . Now , moisture was pooling in her lower lashes , and her vision was bluffed . She was only twenty years old and she 'd never known a man or held a baby of her own , and she did n't want to die . Chilver got out his pocket watch and flicked open the case with a brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the hour . " Time 's a wastin ' , Dan'l , " ' he said . " I 'll marry her , " Daniel said , and it was as though the words were dragged out of him . He plopped the hat back onto his head , vaulted into the rear of the wagon with surprising agility for someone of his size , and lifted the rope from around Jolie 's neck . She came near to sagging against him in relief but caught herself at the last moment . He undid the rawhide ties that were cutting into her wrists , hooked his hands under her arms , and lowered her easily to the ground . Then he was towering beside her , as hard and substantial as a tamarack tree . Jolie swayed slightly , and he caught her briefly against his side . She was tall for a woman , nearly five feet nine inches , but her chin reached only as high as Daniel 's shirt pocket . She heard the murmurs and mutterings of the townspeople as if through a wall of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pull down the rope he 'd slung over the tree branch earlier . The judge was peering into her face , his breath ripe with whiskey and a general lack of hygiene . " How about you , little lady ? You want to marry Dan Beckham ? " Jolie swallowed . She 'd never seen Mr. Beckham before and , for all she knew , he was a Republican , a drunkard , and a woman-beater , but it seemed to her that her choices were severely limited  --  at least , for the moment . " I 'll marry him , " she rasped . Now that she was fairly certain she would n't swoon , bile was stinging the back of her throat and her stomach was jumping . " You sure about this , Dan'l ? " the old politician inquired , rocking back on his heels , cocky as a bantam rooster . The muscle in Daniel 's jaw flexed again . " I 'm sure , " he said , avoiding Jolie 's gaze this time . " Let 's get on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money later . " Jolie 's surroundings undulated around her as she struggled to absorb the shock of unexpected salvation . All the while , she was praying she would n't throw up on the farmer 's boots and convince him to withdraw his offer . The throng moved in closer , as curious to see a wedding as they had been to witness a hanging , and Jolie made herself meet one pair of eyes , then another and another . I 'm alive , she challenged them silently , and damn you to hell for wanting to watch me die . " I 've got a license on my desk , " Mr. Chilver said brightly . " It 's just a matter of saying the words . " The irony of being married by the same judge who had sentenced her to hang by the neck until dead was not lost on Jolie , but she was still too shaken to grasp all the nuances of the situation . She was going to live to see another sun blaze over the ripening wheat and the timbered foothills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary paper , and Daniel and Jolie stood under the oak tree that would have been her gallows . The townspeople pressed close , paying avid attention , elbowing each other and snickering . Jolie made the responses that were required of her , unaware of the tears that were making pale tracks in the mask of dust that covered her face . When it was over , she and Daniel both signed the ornately decorated document , then her new husband took her elbow and ushered her toward a battered wagon waiting in the alleyway between the mercantile and the feed and grain . Only when she saw the man 's signature on the appropriate line did she realize that her name was no longer McKibben , but Beckham . Mr. Beckham handed her into the box in an offhandedly solicitous way , then went back to pick up the burgeoning sack he 'd set down when he came out of the feed store . After loading this into the back of the wagon , he climbed up into the seat beside Jolie , who sat ramrod straight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reins , and released the brake lever with one boot heel . He favored the population of Prosperity with a cool nod and set the team of two sturdy brown mules in motion with a flick of one wrist . Jolie 's thumbs twiddled , and she bit her lip , her eyes narrowed under the brim of her hat as she watched the weathered facades of the town 's main street fall behind . " Why did you do it ? " she finally asked , when the wagon wheels were jostling over two hard-packed ruts and spring wheat waved on either side of them . " Why did you marry a woman you do n't even know ? " Daniel waited so long to speak that Jolie was beginning to think he did n't plan on responding , but then he looked squarely into her filthy face and said , " They were going to hang you . " It was the obvious reply , Jolie realized she had been hoping for something quite different , though she did n't know exactly what that something was . " Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , it would n't do if she got Daniel Beckham to thinking he 'd made a mistake and ought to take her back to hang from the single oak tree in the center of town . " Are you ? " he countered , gazing thoughtfully on the rumps and sweaty backs of the long-eared mules pulling the wagon . Jolie felt her cheeks burn beneath the coating of dirt . " No , " she replied , a little indignantly . " I was just with Blake and Rowdy , that 's all . I did n't know they were going to rob the bank . " Even though she 'd been over the fact a thousand times , it still stung Jolie that Blake and Rowdy had not only done that horrendous thing , but had abandoned her to face the consequences alone . Daniel  --  she could n't quite bring herself to think of him as her husband  --  shifted his hat slightly forward to scratch the back of his head . " That raises another question . What were you doing with the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jolie flushed . It made for a long , complicated story , the way she 'd hooked up with Blake . She did n't delude herself that anyone , least of all Daniel , would believe the truth  --  that she had never been intimate with either Blake or Rowdy , even though she 'd traveled with them for nearly two weeks . " I worked as a maid , back in Seattle , in the same house with Blake 's mother . She was the cook . " The team and wagon topped a knoll , and Jolie 's attention was diverted to a large , white frame house flanked with tidy-looking outbuildings . There was a well house with a shingled roof , and as they drew up in front of the barn , she saw a moat of bright blue cornflowers blooming around a black iron pump a few yards from the kitchen door . A board spanned the mud puddle beneath , supporting a bucket to catch drips . A row of poplar trees stood guarding the place from wind , and all around the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue of the sky was poignantly beautiful to Jolie , since she 'd come so near to closing her eyes to it forever . Daniel set the brake , wound the reins around the lever , and got down , raising his big , calloused hands for Jolie . She took solace in his strength as he lifted her to the ground . " Get yourself cleaned up , then see what you can rustle up for dinner , " he said . Since Jolie had never really known kindness from a male , Daniel 's order did n't strike her as particularly abrupt . Besides , she was too grateful to quibble over a little thing like how a man framed his words . She nodded , and when he turned to walk away , she reached out impulsively and caught hold of his shirtsleeve with two fingers . He looked back at her over one shoulder , his expression unreadable because his features were hidden by the brim of his hat . Jolie let go of his shirt and spoke shyly , her eyes lowered . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering , neither was there an unspoken " you 're welcome " in his tone . " There 's food in the pantry , " he said instead . " Deuter and I will be hungry , so make sure you put plenty on the table . " With that , her unlikely knight turned and walked away , toward the barn . Jolie watched him go , wondering who Deuter was even as she decided it would be inappropriate to ask , then set out for the house . The back threshold was at least a foot off the ground , so Jolie hoisted her riding skirt and goose-stepped into the kitchen . It was a surprisingly clean place , with whitewashed , walls and solid wood floors and a big iron and chrome cookstove that gleamed in the fierce light pouring in through spotless windows . Jolie took off the derby hat that had given her some protection from the sun and hung it carefully on one of the pegs next to the door . There was a shaving mirror on the wall opposite the stove , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was straggling down from its pins and clinging wetly to her gritty neck , and there was a mask of dirt covering her face . She found a basin in the pantry , along with shelf after shelf of preserved fruits , meat , and vegetables and enormous supplies of sugar and lard and beans . Yearning for a bath and clean clothes , Jolie contented herself with a splash to her face and hands , helping herself to tepid water from the reservoir on the side of the stove . When she felt presentable , Daniel Beckham 's new bride set two places at the table and brought a jar marked " sausage " from the pantry . She built up the fire with wood from the box beside the stove and dipped water into a saucepan , setting the preserves inside so the heat would melt the lard that encased the meat . She found cold milk , butter , and cheese out in the well house , and fresh-baked bread in a metal-lined storage bin in the kitchen . The aroma of just-brewed coffee was pungent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately followed by a young , husky boy with dark red hair , huge brown eyes , and shoulders that could have been measured with a wagon axle . " This is Deuter , " Daniel said , hanging up his hat . " Deuter , Mrs. Beckham . " Jolie was pleased to be referred to so formally ; it made her feel a little less like some stray found on the side of the road . Despite the pass her life had come to , she had some pride . " Hello , Deuter , " she said , with a polite nod . By then , the lard surrounding the sausage had melted , and Jolie drained the fat into a tin can and dropped the meat into a cast-iron skillet . " Pretty enough to kiss all over , " Deuter remarked , drawing Jolie 's harried attention back to him with a start . Out of the corner of one eye , she saw Daniel turn away to hide a grin . Jolie 's cheeks were hot . " I 'll thank you to keep such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly . " Just Deuter , " replied the farmhand , showing resignation but no sign of remorse . " And I pretty much have to say whatever comes into my head . Do n't exactly know why . " " Let 's get washed up , " Daniel told him , ladling hot water from the stove reservoir into a basin . This he carried outside , along with a bar of yellow soap , and Deuter followed . Jolie heard splashing , then Deuter returned to fill the basin with fresh water for himself . Daniel , looking scrubbed , sat down at the table , frowning as he regarded the two place settings . " Are n't you eating ? " Averting her eyes , Jolie shook her head . " No , Mr. Beckham  --  not now . My stomach is n't feeling right . " Daniel sighed and reached for the platter of reheated sausage when Jolie put it on the table . " Guess that 's no great wonder , " he commented , and dropped the matter at that . Deuter came in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove , and joined Daniel . The boy looked strangely ingenuous , with his slicked down hair and clean hands and face , like a first grade student eager to please his teacher . " I 'd  --  I 'd like to look around the place a little , if you do n't mind , " Jolie dared , sinking her teeth into her lower lip while she awaited Daniel 's answer . " You could sure use a good scrubbing , " Deuter remarked , cutting off a chunk of the ground sausage with the side of his fork and scraping it onto his plate . Again , Jolie saw just the hint of a smile touch the corner of Daniel 's mouth , though he made no comment . " And you could use a lesson in manners , " Jolie responded . Deuter was n't in the least chagrined . " No good . My ma and all my teachers tried everything . Did n't work . " " Look around all you want , " Daniel said with diplomatic formality , although his amusement had now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , Jolie dashed through the dining room and found herself in a genuine ladies ' parlor , complete with frilled pillows , china figurines , potted palm trees , and photographs in ornate silver frames . There was an organ in front of the bay window , and delicate ecru lace curtains of the finest quality billowed in a stray breeze around the polished instrument . Jolie went to the fireplace , which was fronted with white and gray fieldstones , and squinted at the daguerreotype displayed prominently on the pinewood mantel . It was obviously a wedding picture , and the groom was Daniel . Behind his chair , with one graceful hand resting on his shoulder , stood a bride resplendent in lace and silk . She was small , delicate as a cameo , with rich dark hair and large , expressive eyes . Jolie felt diminished , just looking into that guileless face , and she was consumed by a need to know the woman 's name and what had happened to her . And because she was in no position to ask , she propelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply furnished study on the other side of the entryway . Here , Daniel kept ledgers and books of all sizes and sorts . Reading was a trial for Jolie , though she could make out what she needed to know if she tried hard enough , and she felt a pang as she backed out of the study . She wondered what Daniel would think when he realized he 'd married a woman who was practically ignorant . Mr. Beckham probably would n't be at all surprised to learn she could barely manage the written word , she reflected with a long sigh . After all , their entire courtship had taken place within five minutes , under the shadow of a hangman 's noose . Her face throbbed with heat as she climbed the stairs , clutching her dusty skirts in her hands to keep from tripping on the hem . It would n't do to get romantic ideas ; she was lucky just to be alive . Upstairs , Jolie found three spacious bedrooms , two of which were furnished . Jolie felt the first flash of alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck that morning . She was Daniel Beckham 's legal wife , never mind that they were complete strangers , and there was little doubt in her mind what he would expect after the sun went down . If he waited that long . Her knees sagged , weakened by the prospect of lying down for a man for the first time . If it had n't been for that , Jolie would n't have sat on the edge of Daniel 's sturdy four-postered-bed the way she did . The creak of hinges startled her , and her eyes went wide when she realized Daniel was standing in the bedroom doorway . There was a look of quiet hilarity in his gaze , but there was also wanting ; even in her relative innocence , Jolie would have recognized that anywhere . " Why do they call that boy ' Deuter ' ? " " she asked in a shaky voice , hoping to distract Daniel from the inevitable , at least for a little while . Holding his hat in one hand , he rested one shoulder against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen through Jolie 's ploy . " It 's short for Deuteronomy . The lad did his damnedest to learn to spell it , but he could never get any further than Deuter , so he finally just stopped there . " Under other circumstances , Jolie might have been amused . As it was , she was too terrified to appreciate levity . " He should have kept trying , " she threw out , desperate to keep the exchange going , puny as it was . Daniel shrugged and straightened . " There 's where you and I do n't see eye to eye , " he replied easily . " If he had n't been the most determined kid in three territories , he probably would have stopped at ' Deut . ' " Jolie swallowed hard . " I suppose you have lots of work to do out in the barn and the  --  the fields . " To her wild relief , he set the hat back on his head . " Yes , ma'am , " he said . " I do . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolie dizzy , and she could n't help closing her eyes for a moment as it swept through her system , like warm brandy mixed with sugar and cream . " Are n't you afraid I 'll take off or something ? " she asked , after a short interval of catching her inner balance . Daniel was just about to turn away when she looked at him again . " It would be my guess that you do n't have much of anywhere to go , " he said . And then he was gone , his boot heels making a rhythmic sound on the naked wooden stairs . Jolie thrust herself off Daniel Beckham 's mattress . When she heard a door slam in the distance , she went to the big , plain oak wardrobe opposite the bed and opened it . Shirts hung neatly within , along with trousers , but there was nothing for Jolie to wear . She moved on to the second bedroom , which was smaller and boasted only a washstand , a trunk , and a narrow iron bed . Daniel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to flee to , and the fact nettled Jolie almost as much as the disheveled state of her person . She found a blue calico print dress in the trunk and , although the garment would definitely be too short for her , she figured she could squeeze into it and thus have something to wear while she washed out her own clothes . Jolie hurried downstairs and , after a visit to the outhouse , which was all but covered in fading purple lilacs , she returned to the well house for the washtub she 'd spotted there earlier . As she left the cool darkness for the bright afternoon , with its buzzing bees and pungent aromas , the toe of her shoe caught against the edge of a loose board , and she tripped . The washtub went thumping and clanging onto the hardpacked dirt path outside and Jolie gripped the sides of the door frame to keep from failing , a splinter stabbing into her palm . She flinched , then turned to stomp the offending board back into place with a vengeance . Outside in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skin and pressed the small wound against her mouth , exasperated . First , she 'd come as near to hanging as any sensible person would care to , then she 'd been married to a man she 'd never laid eyes on before in her life . Now , she 'd practically been crucified . This was turning out to be one hell of a day . As Daniel chopped and stacked the firewood he and Deuter had brought down from the hills the day before , he recalled the time he 'd seen Hobb Jackson drop a bulging burlap sack into Caldron Creek . Daniel had been hunting that morning , and he was on foot , carrying a brace of grouse in one hand and his rifle in the other . The moment he 'd seen the bag drop from Hobb 's hand , he 'd known it contained another batch of kittens . Seized by a rage that made him want to bellow even as it strangled all sound from his throat , Daniel had flung down the rifle and his game and run to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there , and Daniel splashed into the icy , thigh-deep water and wrenched the sodden bag from the rocky creek bottom . By the time he got back to the bank and carefully cut the burlap open with his hunting knife , four of the small , furry bodies inside were still , but one , a sputtering tom , gave a watery yowl and promptly bit Daniel 's finger . He smiled as he swung the ax . Even though she was n't of the same gender , his new bride had more in common with that ornery little feline than the luck to survive . She 'd had the same expression of terrified rebellion in her eyes , standing there in the back of that wagon , waiting to be hanged , and Daniel figured the biting would come next . He stopped , mopped his sweating forehead with one sleeve , and set another chunk of wood on the block . Deuter was moving in and out of the shed , stacking the split pine and fir to season for a few months . Just then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , the palm of one hand pressed to her mouth . A moment later , she was heading purposely toward the kitchen door , carrying the tub by its handle . The deduction Daniel made was both simple and ordinary . Jolie was about to take a bath  --  something most people did at least once a week  --  but now the knowledge made his blood burn in his veins like kerosene . He felt his groin tighten painfully as he imagined her stripping away those seedy old clothes of hers and stepping naked into clean , hot water . By that point , Daniel 's concentration was so strained that the ax head bounced off a knot in a piece of wood and came within an inch of opening a crevice in his shin . With a mighty swing , he set the blade deep into the chopping block and then swept off his hat . " Guess you could go watch her wash if you wanted to , " Deuter commented , from the doorway of the woodshed . " She 's your wife now . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nerves , and this was one of them . Although he had no fond feelings for Jolie , he did n't like the idea of another man  --  even one as young and backward as his hired hand  --  speculating about such private matters . " I want that wood stacked by sundown , " he said evenly . " You 'd best get back to work . " After that , Daniel gathered his forces and forced himself to take up the ax again . And the image of Jolie bathing did n't cross his mind more than four or five hundred times in the next half hour .
