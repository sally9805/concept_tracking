I Ca n't Stop the Bleeding <p> I 've had postmenopausal bleeding problems for the past nine years . I 'm 59 now . My doctor told me it 's because my body is producing too much estrogen . I 've had three D &Cs; ( to rule out cancer ) , and I do n't want to have a hysterectomy . Other than being overweight , I 'm in good health . Is there anything I can do to stop the bleeding ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Regular exercise can ease hormonal fluctuations . <p> Several things may be causing the problem you describe . First , I wonder if you truly are postmeno-pausal . You really ca n't go by age alone . A woman is considered menopausal when she 's gone one year without a period . I have a patient who is 59 and still not menopausal ! <p> It 's possible that you 're in that transition phase to menopause called perimenopause , characterized by missed periods and irregular cycles . These menstrual cycle changes are brought on when your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is causing the lining of your uterus to thicken . But since you 're probably not ovulating regularly , you 're not producing the progesterone you need to shed the lining . You may want to talk to your doctor about taking a progestin-a synthetic progesterone like Provera-or an oral form of natural progesterone . This will prevent the lining from thickening too much-a risk factor for endometrial cancer . Going six months without your period during perimenopause can increase your risk of this cancer . <p> Since your body is probably producing less estrogen than it did when you were younger , where 's the excess estrogen coming from ? The extra weight you 're carrying may be the answer . Your body 's fat tissue makes a form of estrogen called estrone that , like ovarian estrogen , stimulates the lining of your uterus to grow . And again , without progesterone , the lining builds up and can become cancerous . For this reason-and many others-your best bet is to shed those pounds with a good low-fat diet and exercise program . Why Do I Cry So Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't feel depressed ; I just have trouble controlling my emotions . Could this be caused by a chemical imbalance ? <p> Even though you say you 're not depressed , crying and being overly emotional are symptoms of depression . Others include a change in sleeping or eating habits , headaches , loss of interest in activities , and an increase in alcohol use . If this sounds like you , you may be depressed . <p> It 's crucial to discuss what you 're experiencing with your health care provider . She can help you identify events in your life that may be causing your depressed mood and rule out any physical reasons such as a thyroid disorder , diabetes , or vitamin deficiency . Some medications such as antihypertensives ( beta-blockers ) and some antianxiety drugs ( benzo-diazepines like Valium ) are also associated with depression . So it 's a good idea to review with her all of your medications . <p> But it 's also possible that your emotional reactions are the result of physical or biochemical changes in your body . An imbalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . Many doctors believe that low levels of serotonin in the brain may promote depression , which is then treated with SSRIs ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) such as Zoloft or Prozac . <p> Although no one knows for sure what effect declining levels of estrogen at menopause have on mood , preliminary research suggests that hormonal changes may alter the activity of neurotransmitters in the brain . In fact , several studies have shown that estrogen replacement therapy improves mood in some women . You might want to try estrogen to see if it helps . <p> Regular exercise such as walking may also make you feel better . Exercise stimulates the brain to make endorphins that , in addition to being pain-killers , are natural antidepressants . Start out easy and build up to at least 2 miles a day . an imbalance of brain chemicals can affect our moods . Possible Causes for Painful Periods <p> My menstrual periods are very painful . I had a cone biopsy , and the result was normal . Even getting a Pap test now has become painful . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : OTC painkillers-or fish oils-can ease menstrual pain . <p> Though it 's rare , the cone biopsy ( to detect cervical cancer ) may have scarred your cervix , and this thickened scar tissue could be hindering blood flow during your period . This causes a backup of menstrual blood , which in turn triggers cramping . It can also make a Pap test uncomfortable . Gynecologists treat it by gently stretching the cervix to allow blood to flow more easily . <p> Severe menstrual cramping can also be caused by endometriosis : Tissue from the uterine lining ( endometrium ) breaks away and implants itself elsewhere in the pelvis and abdomen rather than being shed . Laparoscopic surgery can rule out endometriosis . <p> The most common culprits are hormonelike chemicals called prostaglandins that stimulate the uterus to contract . Medications such as ibuprofen and naproxen block their production . For the drugs to be most effective , you need to take them a few hours or a day before your cramps begin . Many patients get relief with fish oil capsules , which also interfere with the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) fish oil capsules every day will provide about 1 g of combined EPA and DHA ( omega-3 fatty acids ) . <p> Exercise can also help relieve cramps by increasing the level of endorphins-your body 's natural painkillers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Mary Jane Minkin , MD <p> By Mary Jane Minkin , MD with Toby Hanlon <p> <p> Mary Jane Minkin , MD , is a board-certified **26;1269;TOOLONG in private practice in New Haven , CT , and a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medecine .
