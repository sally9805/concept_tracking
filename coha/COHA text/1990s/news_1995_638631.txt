<p> JUPITER , Fla. - It 's not surprising that Jupiter is Mike Schmidt 's address now . Maddeningly introspective , unusually sensitive , prone to intellectual self-torture , the greatest player in Phillies history always seemed mentally marooned someplace far removed from his baseball contemporaries . <p> In January , Schmidt made baseball history one last time . He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame with the most votes ( 444 ) received by any player in the 59 years in which the Baseball Writers Association of America has been conducting the balloting . <p> " I guess this is kind of the topping , the icing on the cake , the culmination of a career , " said Schmidt , who spent his half-hour news conference at Veterans Stadium alternately cherishing this honor and wishing he 'd been more of a fun guy during those 18 seasons . <p> " I 'm just now starting to get some goose bumps out of this thing . And I think that will only increase as Cooperstown grows near . " The honor leaves him , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head forever . " <p> Between last January 's selection and Sunday 's induction , this reflective 45-year-old has been asked often to look back on a career as perhaps the best third baseman ever . <p> Yet , while he has no trouble recalling all those big home runs among the 548 he hit - he still can tell you the count on which he hit most of them - it is n't necessarily a pleasant experience . Dealing with the past means dealing with a lot of regrets , you see . And it is doubtful that any Hall of Famer ever enjoyed his career less than Mike Schmidt . <p> " There 's no question at all that I did n't enjoy my professional life like I wished I would have , " Schmidt said last January . " I did n't allow myself to enjoy it because of my obsession for succeeding , my obsession for wanting to be the best . <p> " There was always something gnawing at me , something that would n't allow me to free myself up to enjoy that whole ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about life , so intense that I forget it should be a lot more enjoyable . " <p> If that sounds like a middle-aged man sadly reviewing a misspent youth , that is exactly how Schmidt tends to view his baseball days now . The pride he feels over his three MVP awards , his eight home-run titles , his 10 Gold Gloves , is counterbalanced by memories of the anguish he experienced in earning them . And when , in 1993 , he watched a relaxed Phillies team win a pennant , he was envious of its joyful abandon . <p> " I could have fit in with them , " he said . " I spent so many years doing it the other way that maybe those guys would have said , ' Hey , Mike , forget hitting off the tee . Sit down with us . Have a few beers . Tell a few jokes and forget about it . ' Their approach probably would have helped me . <p> " I believe that if John Kruk and I melded together , we 'd have a hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , country-type attitude that the fans latch onto and love , and put it together with my work ethic , my knowledge of the game , my experience with winning , and you 'd have , without question , the makings of a tremendous player . <p> " Had I had a more relaxed attitude , " Schmidt said , " I would have enjoyed life a lot more , been a lot more interested in being a part of the Philadelphia environment , the business world , gotten more comfortable with the city . But maybe I would n't ever have achieved what I did as a player . Maybe I would have had a mediocre career . <p> " On the other hand , if I 'd just have gone to the park to have some fun with the boys and not worried so much about my daily routines , my superstitions , maybe I 'd have hit more home runs . We 'll never know the answer to that , but I guarantee you one thing : I would n't have retired when I did . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't been so obsessed with my performance . " <p> At the sudden conclusion of his 18-year career , when he announced his retirement in May 1989 , Schmidt was " mentally fried . " Like a fugitive embezzler eager to assume a new identity , he quickly fled Philadelphia for Florida 's east coast . There , he found a home in a beautiful private community thick with Mercedes and yachts , with a golf course and lake , and with walls and guards to preserve a blissful isolation . <p> " Now I 'm able to pretend that I 'm another person , " Schmidt said . " I am enjoying a life totally separate from the life that I was unable to enjoy . " <p> When he sold his lakeside Delaware County , Pa. , estate and headed south , he was widely appreciated in Philadelphia and recognized as one of the game 's all-time greats . But that recognition took years to achieve - painful years as he now recalls them . <p> " I had some periods , even during my best years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports fans of Philadelphia , " said Schmidt , whose daily 90-minute workouts have left him looking just as fit and healthy as he did in 1989 . " I went out there every night not sure what kind of reaction I was going to get , but pretty sure it was going to be negative . <p> " It can be an uncomfortable environment to exist in when it 's happening to you . You try to have your wife and kids in the stands , and people are yelling at them . You tend to look back at it as not being that serious . But when it 's happening , it 's extremely serious . But now , well , time heals all wounds . " <p> Schmidt believes the early animosity he encountered in Philadelphia derived from the effortless way he appeared to play the game . Philadelphia fans worshiped the guys who dived in the dirt and chugged breathlessly around the bases . They wanted grime and guts , not a studied cool . <p> The notion he was n't playing hard - simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Pete Rose - irritates him still . <p> " Obviously , " Schmidt said , " Lenny Dykstra , Pete Rose , Gary Matthews , thoseguys gave the appearance that , ' Hey , this guy loves the game . This guy will do anything to win . This guy works harder than anybody . ' <p> " If I knew then what I know now about image on the field , if I knew the value of a dirty uniform , I would have dove into more bases , dove after more balls . " <p> The threat of nightly vilification finally ended late in Schmidt 's career , when his numbers had accumulated to proportions impressive enough to silence even Philadelphia 's boobirds . <p> " I remember my reconciliation with the fans of Philadelphia , " he said . " It was a night at the end of ' 86 , when I passed Lou Gehrig , who had 494 homers , and was getting close to 500 . I got a great ovation , and there was something about that night that got me over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment that it no longer mattered what I did - whether I struck out with the bases loaded or hit a home run with the bases loaded . There was a sense among the fans of ' Hey , man , it does n't matter anymore . Thanks for all you 've done . " ' <p> SCHMIDT 'S CAREER HIGHLIGHTS <p> On Sunday , Mike Schmidt will become the 170th major-league player and 220th overall inducted into Baseball 's Hall of Fame .
