WE WERE FINE . We were holding onto a fine day on the fine Green River in the mountains of Utah five hours from Salt Lake with the sun out and Toby already fishing when his mother Glenna said , " We 're sinking . " She had been a pain in the ass since dawn . I wanted nothing more than to argue , prove her wrong , but I could n't because there was water in the bottom of the raft . You 're supposed to leave your troubles behind when you float a river , but given our histories , that was a fat chance . <p> We were that strange thing : old friends . I 'd known Glenna since college ; she had been Lily 's roommate , and there was a time when we were close as close . She had been an ally in my quest for Lily . We 'd had a thousand coffees at their kitchen table and she 'd counseled and coached me , been a friend . Then after college she had married my pal Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Lily , which had recently ( twenty-two days ago ) become mine . Warren had not been good to Glenna . His specialty was young women , and he used his position as editor of the Register to sharpen it . She had grown embittered to say the least , and I wanted now simply to cut that deal  --  old friends or not  --  call her a sour unlikable bitch and get on with the day my way ; if I had known that she was going to be the photographer for this story , I 'd have stayed in town . <p> Glenna had her suitcase  --  something that has no business even near a raft  --  balanced on the side tube , and she held her camera case aloft in the other hand . It was dripping . The suitcase made me mad , or was I just mad because Glenna had something on me ? She had been to Lily 's wedding a month ( twenty-two days ) ago . She had talked to Lily . Now I could see the water over the tops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not common to tear a raft on the gravel , but it happened . I looked downriver for a landing site . The banks were both steep cutaways , but there was a perfect sandbar off to the right , and I paddled for it . <p> After the three of us dragged the raft clear of the water and unloaded the gear , spreading it out to dry , I set Toby at the downstream point with a small Mepps spinner and went back to repair the raft . Glenna was sitting on her suitcase , checking her camera . Her goddamned suitcase . Warren had assigned me the story and her the photographs . " Floating the Green "  --  it would run in Thursday Sports . <p> I was trying not to think . I had taken the job to get out of town and because I needed the money . Warren said the photographer would pick me up at four A.M. , and there in the dark when I saw Glenna 's ' 70 Seville , the same car she 'd had at school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time in that car . And I knew she 'd seen Lily . Twenty-two days . If I had been ready , been able to commit ; if I had been thirty percent mature ; if I had not assumed being more " interesting " than Lily 's other dates would keep me first , then I might not have been standing on a sandbar with my teeth in my lip . Did I want to ask Glenna a few questions ? Does Lily miss me ? Has she said my name ? Where should I send her tapes ? Yes . Would I ? Hey , I had a raft to fix , and as I said , I was trying not to think . <p> Now sitting on her suitcase on a sandbar , Glenna stretched and reached into her bag for another Merit , which she lit and inhaled . " How 'd he talk you into this one " she said as she . smoked . <p> " He mentioned the beauty of nature . " I waved up at the sunny gorge , the million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sweet light ... " <p> " Bullshit , Jack . " <p> " The money , which I need . " I flopped the raft upside down . There were a dozen black patches of various sizes on the bottom , but I could find no new hole . Using my knife , I tested the edges of all the old patches , and , sure enough , one large one was loose . " What about you ? You do n't need another photo credit . " <p> She pointed at Toby where he fished from the edge of the sand . " I 'm here because you know how to do whatever it is we 're going to do and you can show it to Toby in some semblance of man-to-boy good will and something will have been gained . " She flipped the butt into the Green River . " About the rest , I could give a shit . If Warren wants me out of town so he can chase Lolita , so be it . " <p> I bent to my work , scraping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed a two-inch L-shaped tear . I wiped the area down and prepared my own new patch with the repair kit while the sun dried the bottom of the raft . I did n't like that phrase , " so be it . " There 's gloom if not doom in that one . <p> And sure enough , a moment later Glenna spoke again . " Jack , " she said . " Something 's happening with the water . " Her imprecision almost cheered me ; then I looked and saw our sandbar was shrinking . Toby had reeled in and was walking back , stepping with difficulty in the soft sand . <p> " Jack , " he said . " The water 's rising . " <p> I stood still and watched it for a moment . The clear water crawled slowly and surely up the sand . The water was rising . <p> " My patch is n't dry . Load everything on the raft as it is . " I set the cooler and my pack on the upside-down raft and Glenna put her suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a heap on the raft . Glenna paused long enough to snap a few photographs of our disaster . <p> The water inched up , covering our feet , lifting at the raft . <p> " We 're going to get wet now , are n't we , " Glenna said . <p> " Yes , " I said . " Just hold on to the raft and we 'll float it down to the gravel spit . " I pointed downstream two hundred yards . <p> " Why is the water rising " Toby said , laying his pole onto our gear . <p> " Power for Los Angeles , " I told him . <p> " Some guy 's VCR timer just kicked in so he can record ' Divorce Court ' while he 's out playing tennis , " Glenna said . " This water is cold ! " <p> Finally enough water crept under the raft to lift it free , and we walked it down into the deeper water of the fresh , cold Green River . " Jack , " Glenna said , blaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cold ! " <p> " Just hold on , " I said to Toby as the water rose toward my chin . " This will be easy . " <p> That is when I saw the next thing , something over my shoulder , and I turned as a small yellow raft drifted swiftly by . There were four women crowded into it . They appeared to be naked . <p> An hour later , we started again . We had clambered out of the river onto the gravel , unloaded the raft , let the patch air-dry for thirty minutes while Toby and I chose our next series of flies and Glenna , stripped down to her tank top and Levis , commenced drinking lemon-lime and cherry wine coolers . Then we turned the raft over again , reloaded it , and tenderly made into the river . I immediately pieced Toby 's fly rod together , attached the reel , and geared him up with a large woolly caddis , the kind of mothy thing that bred thickly on this part of the river . I clipped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , this early in the day , to handle . Sitting on the side of the raft I began to organize my tackle , and I had to consciously slow myself down . My blood was rich with the free feeling I always get on a river . The sunshine angled down with its first heat of the day on my forearms as I worked , and I realized that my life was a little mess , but for now I was free . It was okay . I was now afloat in a whole different way . It was a feeling a boy has . I smiled , a little ruefully . Even in a life that is totally waxed , there are still stupid pleasures . It was morning , and I smiled ; come on , who has n't screwed up a life ? <p> Toby had a sharp delivery on his cast , which we worked on for a while as the raft drifted along the smooth sunny river . He was still throwing the line , not punching it into place , but he mastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set the fly in the swollen riffles about half the time . It was now late in the morning , but there was enough shade on the water that the fishing could still be good . <p> I started working the little nymph in the quiet shady pools against the mountain as we 'd pass . Once , twice , drift , and back . I saw some sudden shadows and I was too quick on the one rise I had . Glenna was sitting on her awful suitcase , back against the raft tube , her arms folded , drinking her coolers , quiet as Sunday school behind her oversize dark glasses . From time to time I had to set my rod down and avert collision with the canyon wall or a small boulder in the river with the paddle and center us again . <p> Later in the morning Glenna took a series of photographs of Toby as he knelt and flycast from his end of the raft . She was able , in fact , to film his first fish , a nice twenty-inch rainbow trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of the water to his tail , and Toby , without a scream or a giggle , worked the fish into the current and fifty yards later into our now-hot boat . He was a keeper , and Toby said , finally letting his enthusiasm show , " The first one I caught from a raft , ever . " I killed the fish on my knee , showing Toby how to tap it smartly behind the cranium , and put it in my creel . <p> " It 's awfully good luck to have the first fish be a keeper , " I told him . " Now our nerves are down and we can be generous with the newcomers . " Even Glenna seemed pleased watching us , as if her expectations for this sojourn were somehow being met . <p> I thought about the article I would write . I could have written it without coming , really . I knew the Green . I would talk about the regulations ( flies and lures only  --  no bait ) ; I would talk about the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take along a patch-kit . I would not mention anything that happened next . <p> The sun had straightened into noon , and the fishing had slowed considerably . I had taken two little trout from pools in the lee of two boulders , handling them with exaggerated care for Toby 's information and then returning them to the water . Then , around the next bend , there was a long slow avenue of river , and I found out I had been right about the four rafters . They had been nude . About a half-mile down , under a sunny gray shale escarpment , there was a party in session . Eleven or twelve rafts of all sizes had been beached , and fifty or sixty people loitered around the area in a formless nude cocktail party . <p> " Fish this side of the raft , " I said to Toby , adjusting his pole opposite the nudists . Just as I settled him , with a promise of lunkers in that lane , Glenna spotted the partiers and determined the nature of the activity . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which evoked her less subtle qualities , and she cried out , " Check this out ! " <p> A dozen or so of these noble campers sat bareassed on a huge fallen log along the river , nursing their beers , taking the sun , watching the river the way people wait for a bus . heard one call out , " Raft alert ! Raft ho ! " There was some laughter and a stir of curiosity about our little craft as it drew closer . <p> I wondered what it was about the wilds that made all these young lawyers feel impelled to take off their clothing . Is it true that as soon as most folks ca n't see the highway anymore , they immediately disrobe ? We came abreast of the naked natives in an eerie slow-motion silence . They stopped drawing beer from the keg , quit conversations , stood off the log . Many turned toward us or took half a step toward the river . Glenna was leaning dangerously out of the raft on that side , another wine-cooler casualness ( she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiveled fully around from his fishing duties , striking me in the ear with the tip of his rod . I lifted it from his hands . <p> One bold soul strode down to the edge of the river , waggling himself in the sunshine . He lifted his cup of beer at us and called , " Howdy ! What ya doing ? " Behind him , still standing against the log , was a slender , dark-haired girl who looked a lot like Lily . She was about as tall and had the posture . Her breasts were pure white , the two whitest things I 'd ever seen at noon on a river , a white that hurt the eyes , and her pubic hair glinted red in the bright sunlight . Oh , do n't need to see these things . I need to fish and have my heart start again and be able to breathe without this weight in my chest . I physically could . not stop looking at the girl . <p> " The same thing you are , " Glenna answered . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed a full raw laugh back in her throat , leaning so hard on the side of the raft that a quick stream of cold river sloshed in . As Glenna continued staring the man down and chortling , I thought , This is where it comes from : the devil and the deep blue sea . I looked down into the crystal green slip of the river ; the stones shimmered and blinked , magnifying themselves in the bent waterlight . <p> Slowly , we slid past the naked throng . It seemed a blessing that Glenna had not thought to take any photographs . I shifted some of the gear out of the new bilge water and cast one terrible glance back at the girl and her long bare legs . The arch of her ass along that large smooth log caught my heart like a fishhook . <p> Toby had collapsed like a wet shirt and was sitting on the bottom of the raft , soaking . He bore all the signs of having been electrocuted . I doused his face with a couple handfuls of river water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up again with his fishing pole and a new lure , a lime-green triple teaser which looked good enough for us to eat . I almost had him convinced that it was still possible to fish in this world when I heard Glenna groan and felt the raft shift as she stood . <p> I cursed the pathetic confectioneer who had invented wine coolers , and turned to see Glenna reach down and pull her tank top over her head , liberating Romulus and Remus , the mammoth breasts . Shuddered by the shirt , they rippled for a moment and then settled in the fresh air . <p> " No topless fishing , " I said to her . " Do n't do that . " I handed her the shirt . <p> She threw it in the river . " I 'm not going to fish , " she said back to me . Toby had put his pole down again . This trip had become more dangerous than he 'd ever dreamed . I put one hand on his shoulder to restrain him from leaping into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned back to Glenna and her titanic nudity . It was still a day . The sun touched off the river in a bright , happy way . We fell out of the long straight stretch into a soft , meandering red canyon . It was still a day . <p> " Look , Glenna , " I said . She had opened another wine cooler . " Look . We 're going to fish . This is a raft trip and we 're going to fish . It would help everything if you would take your drink and turn around and face forward . Either way , you 're going to get a wicked sunburn . " I moved the three plastic-covered sleeping bags in such a way as to make her a back rest . She looked at me defiantly , and then she turned her back and settled in . <p> It was still a day . I took the bubble off Toby 's line and showed him how to troll the triple teaser . " There are fish here , " I told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversize Royal Coachman on my line and began casting my side of the river , humming  --  for some reason  --  the Vaughn Monroe version of the ominous ballad , " Ghost Riders in the Sky . " I knew the words , even the yippie-ai-ayes . <p> We passed Little Hole at three o'clock , and I knew things would get better . Ninety-nine percent of the rafters climb out at Little Hole , and we could see two dozen big GMC pickups and campers waiting in the parking lot . We 'd already passed a flotilla of scout rafts all tethered together in a large eddy taking flycasting lessons . It was a relief to see that they did n't have enough gear to spend the night on the river . <p> It had been an odd scene , all those little men in their decorated uniforms nodding seriously into the face of their leader , a guy about my age who was standing on a rock with his fly rod , explaining the backcast . It was his face as it widened in surprise that signaled the troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the largest breasts they would ever witness in person no matter how long they lived . Glenna had smiled easily at all of them , and had waved sweetly at their leader . I said nothing , but put my pole down and paddled hard downstream , just in case Glenna had really got to the guy and brought out the incipient vigilante all scout leaders have in them . I did n't want to be entangled in some midstream citizen 's arrest . <p> Anyway , it was a relief to pass Little Hole and know that we would see no more human beings until tomorrow noon when we 'd land at Brown 's Park and the end of trail , so to speak . <p> By this time , Glenna was relaxed . She 'd slowed her drinking ( and her speech and about everything else ) and seemed to be in a kind of happy low-grade coma , bare-breasted in the prow of our ship like some laid-back figurehead . Toby had been doing well with the triple teaser , taking three small trout which we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they returned to the river in good shape . I had had nothing on the Coachman , but it was not the fly 's fault had been casting in time with " Ghost Riders " : <p> Then cowboy change your ways today , ( cast ) Or with us you will ride , ( cast ) <p> and a fish would have been lucky to even catch a glimpse of its fur . <p> A-trying to catch the Devil 's herd ( cast ) Across these endless skies . ( cast ) <p> So there had been a little pressure , but now the long green shadows dragged themselves languorously across the clear water . It was late afternoon . We were past Little Hole . It was still a day . We dropped around two bends and were suddenly in the real wilderness , I could feel it , and I felt that little charge that the real places give me . <p> I had been here before , of course , many times with Lily . In the old days I thickened my favorite books in the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city Friday night , spend two days fishing scrupulously down the Green River , and drive back five hours from Brown 's Park in the dark , arriving back in town in time for class with a giveaway suntan and the taste of adrenalin in my mouth . My books  --  The Romantic Poets , The Victorian Poets , Eons of Literature  --  were all swollen and twisted , their pages still wet as I sat in class , some of them singed where I had tried to dry them by the fire . Those trips with Lily were excruciatingly one-of-a-kind ventures-the world , planet and desire , fused , and we had our way with it . I remember it all . I remember great poetry roasting cheerily by the fire in some lone canyon while Lily and I lay under the stars . Those beautiful books , I still have them . <p> My line tripped once hard and then I felt another sharp tug as my Royal Coachman snapped away in the mouth of what could only be a keeper set the hook and measured the tension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure rose , and he broke the surface sixty yards behind us in the dark swelling river . <p> " Whoa ! " Toby said . <p> " Watch your line , son , " I told him . " It 's the perfect time of night . " <p> But even as I worked the trout stubbornly forward in the river , I was thinking about Lily . I 'd never grown up , and now even fishing was n't the same . <p> That fish was a keeper , a twenty-inch brown , and so were the two Toby took around the next bend as we passed under a monstrous spruce that leaned over the water . Four hills later we drifted into the narrows of Red Canyon . It was the deep middle of the everlasting summer twilight , and I cranked us over to the bank , booting the old wooden oars hard on the shallow rocky bottom . We came ashore halfway down the gorge so we could make camp . The rocky cliffs had gone coral in the purple sky , and the river glowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenna finally grabbed another T-shirt and struggled into it , something about being on land , I suppose , and said , " Oh , I got ta pee , " stepping stiffly up the sage-grown shore . <p> By the time she returned the darkness had thickened , and Toby and I had a small driftwood fire going and were clearing an area for the tents . Glenna hugged herself against the fresh air coming along the river . She was a little pie-faced , but opened another wine cooler anyway . I fetched a flannel shirt from my kit and gave it to Toby , and then I settled down to the business of frying those fish . Since we were having cocktails , Glenna already reclining before the fire , I decided to take the extra time and make trout chowder . <p> Here 's how : I retrieved my satchel of goodies , including a half pint of Old Kilroy which is a good thing to sip if you 're going to be cooking trout over an open fire while the night cools right down . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use about a tablespoon of lard for each trout , melting it in the frying pan and placing the trout in when the pan is warm , not hot . If the pan is too hot the fish will curl up and make it tricky cooking . If you do n't have lard or butter , it 's OK . Usually you do n't . Without it you have to cook the trout slower , preventing it from sticking and burning in the pan by sprinkling in water and continuously prodding the fish around . Cut off the heads so the fish will fit into the pan . Then slice both onions you brought and let them start to cook around the fish . At the same time , fill your largest pot with water and put it on to boil . In Utah now you have to boil almost all your water . There is a good chance that someone has murdered his neighbor on instructions from God and thrown him in the creek just upstream from where you 're making soup . And regardless , with a river that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of general cooties streaming right along . This is a good time to reach into the pack and peel open a couple cans of sardines in mustard sauce as appetizers , passing them around in the tin along with your Forest Master pocketknife , so the diners can spear a few and pass it on . <p> By the time your water boils , you will have fried the trout . When they 've cooled , it will be easy to bone them , starting at the tail and lifting the skeleton from each . This will leave you with a platter of trout pieces . Add . a package of leek soup mix ( or vegetable soup mix ) to the boiling water and then a package of tomato soup mix ( or mushroom soup mix ) and then the fried onion and some garlic powder . Then slip the trout morsels into the hot soup and cook the whole thing for another twenty minutes while you drink whiskey and mind the fire , You want it to thicken up . Got any condensed milk ? Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepper is good to add about now , too . When it reaches the consistency of gumbo , break out the bowls . Serve it with hunks of bread and maybe a slab of sharp cheddar cheese thrown across the top . It 's a good dinner , easier to eat in the dark than a fried trout , and it stays hot longer and contains the foods real raftsmen need . Bitter women who have been half-naked all day drinking alcoholic beverages will eat trout chowder with gusto , not talking , just sopping it up , cheese , bread , and all . Be prepared to serve seconds . <p> After her second bowl , her mouth still full of bread , Glenna said , " So , quite a day , eh Jack ? " <p> " Five good fish , " I said , nodding at Toby . " Quite a day . " <p> " No , I mean ... " <p> " I know what you mean . " I moved the pot of chowder off the hot ring of rocks around the fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We rescued a day from the jaws of the nudists . " <p> The cooking had calmed me down , and I did n't want to get started with Glenna , especially since she was full of fructose and wine . Cooking , they say , uses a different part of your brain , and I know which part , the good part , the part that 's not wired all screwy with your twelve sorry versions of your personal history and the four jillion second-guesses , backward glances , forehead-slapping embarrassments . The cooking part is clean as a cutting board and fitted accurately with close measurements and easy-to-follow instructions , which , you always know , are going to result in something edible and nourishing , over which you can make real conversation with someone , maybe someone you 've known since college . <p> I ran the crust of my bread around the rim of my bowl and ate the last bite of chowder . It was good to be out of the raft , sitting on the ground by the fire , but I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hay . <p> " Did you have fun , honey ? " Glenna said to Toby . " Are you glad you came ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Do you like old Jack here ? " <p> " Aw , he 's okay , " I said and smiled at Toby . <p> " I 've known Jack a long time . " <p> " I know , " Toby said . <p> " When did we meet , Jack ? " <p> I broke some of the driftwood smaller in my hands and fed the fire back up . Toby had already filled the other kettle with water , and I balanced it over the flames on three rocks . <p> " You want some coffee " I said . I did not want to get started on the old world . We had met in the lobby of Wasatch Dorm my junior year . Glenna had come up to take my picture for the Chronicle . It was the Christmas of the White Album , and Warren had decided I should run for class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lily Westerman . <p> " I do n't think so , " she said , showing me her bottle of Cabernet Lemon-Lime . <p> " Get your cup , Toby , " I said . When I heard the boiling water cracking against the side of my kettle , I poured him a cup of hot chocolate . I fixed myself a cup of instant coffee and poured in a good lick of whiskey . Toby was standing to one side , a bright silhouette in the firelight . <p> " I think I 'll go to bed , " he said . " You guys are going to talk ancient history for a while : Dad was a big man on campus . This was during the war and he ran the paper , and Mom was the head photographer . You were all students , sort of , and Jack was going with Lily who was Mom 's roommate , and their house was like a club in the days when things mattered . " He sipped his chocolate and toasted us . He knew how smart he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's older than I am . " <p> " Oh , Jack , " Glenna said , suddenly looking at me with eyes as cool and sober as the night . " Everybody 's older than you are . That 's always been your thing . It 's kind of cute  --  about half . " She must have seen me listening too hard , because she immediately waved her hand in front of her face and said , " Jack , ignore me . I 'm drunk . That 's what I do now : the drunk housewife . " <p> " I do n't believe her , " I told Toby . <p> " I do n't either , " he said . <p> " Are you mad at your mother for embarrassing you today " Glenna said . She was slumped against a rock opposite me . Her voice was now husky from too much sun , too much wine , too much lemon-lime . <p> " Mom , " Toby said . " I 'm tired . It was a pretty wild day . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his tent . <p> Halfway in the dark , he turned . " But Mom , you know what you said to that guy today , the naked guy ? " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " It was n't right . We were n't fishing with worms . The Green River is artificial flies and lures only . " <p> " OK , honey . " <p> " But it was pretty funny , given the situation . " He nodded once at us . " Good night . " Toby disappeared in the dark . <p> " He 's a good kid , " I said . <p> She nodded the way people nod when their eyes are full and to speak would be to cry . <p> " It 's OK , " I said . " It was a good day . " I looked at her slumped on her suitcase , her hideous and beautiful suitcase , which seemed now simply something else trying to break my heart . <p> " Oh , Jack , I 'm sorry . I 'm so surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm surprised any of it gets to me . If we 'd just met , this would be a fun trip . If we were strangers . We 're two people who know too much . " <p> It was the worst kind of talk I 'd ever heard around a campfire , and I wanted it to go away . " You 're all right , " I said . " You 've got Toby . " That , evidently , was exactly the wrong thing to say , and I sensed this from what I could hear in Glenna 's breath . She was going to cry . The whole night seemed wrong . <p> I could hear a high wind in the junipers , but it was quiet in our camp . The campfire fluttered and sucked , settling down . I stared into the pink coals and watched them pulse white . I could see the bright edge of light on the cliff tip that meant in an hour the moon would break over the canyon . The other noise that came along sure as sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had her hand over her face in a gesture of real grief . I watched her for a moment , holding myself still . I was going to cry too , but I was going to try to wait for the moon . Finally , I went around the dying fire and sat by her . <p> " Hey , Glenna . Glenna , " I whispered . " Did you bring any sunburn stuff ? " <p> She shook her head no . <p> " Here , " I said , handing her my tube of aloe . " Use this tonight . Okay Use plenty . You surely scorched yourself . " I could feel the heat from her sunburn as I sat by her . <p> " He 's a good kid , " she said . <p> " He 's a great kid . " <p> She shuddered and drew up in a series of short serious sobs . When that wave passed , I said , " What 's the matter ? " We were both speaking quietly . <p> She shook her head again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 're bright and young and you get married and you kind of always have money and then , bang-o , a thousand people later you 're sunburned and eating fish in the big woods with an old friend and only the smallest part of it seems like the center of your life anymore . What 's that about ? " <p> I was beyond speaking now , lost in a widening orbit miles from our little fire . I knew she was going to go on . " There is a message , you know . From Lily . We saw her at the wedding . " It had taken her all day , but she had finally said Lily 's name . " It 's terrible of course . We were eating cake and she came over to our table and said to tell Jack hello . So , hello . " <p> Now I had to hold her .

I had forever turned some corner in my life this month ( twenty-two days ) , but I had n't known it until Glenna said hello . Like it or not , I was through being a boy . <p> So be it . <p> We sat there quietly and soon  --  over the steady low flash of the river  --  I could . hear Toby , down in his tent , humming . It was something familiar , a sad ballad involving the devil 's cattle and riding endlessly through the sky . <p>
