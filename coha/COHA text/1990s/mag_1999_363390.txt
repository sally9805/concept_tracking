STARRING : Jim Broadbent , Allan Corduner DIRECTOR : Mike Leigh OPENS : Dec. 24 <P> It 's 1884 , and Gilbert and Sullivan need a hit . Princess Ida is just not doing the sort of business they 're used to . But Sullivan ( Corduner ) wants to write something more serious than comic operettas . And Gilbert ( Broadbent ) keeps trying to recycle stale story lines that his collaborator ( and the critics ) dismiss . <P> Their solution to this problem  --  based on Gilbert 's chance encounter with Japanese culture at a London exhibition  --  turns out to be The Mikado . And Mike Leigh 's movie about mounting that best of all G. &; S. works turns out to be one of the year 's more beguiling surprises . It is not at all the sort of thing one expects from Leigh , the very sober creator of films like Naked and Secrets and Lies , for it is basically the story  --  somewhat comic , somewhat desperate , very carefully detailed  --  of rehearsing and putting on the operetta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it shows how this process takes over everyone 's life  --  eventually driving out all distractions , whether they be Gordon 's defeat at Khartoum , the sterilities of Gilbert 's marriage or the many anxious neuroses of the acting company . It is show biz as therapy , with all tensions temporarily resolved when the show is a hit . But there is also a sense of real , very Mike Leighish , life in this film that darkens and transforms it . And transfixes us . <P>  --  R.S.
