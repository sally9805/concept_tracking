Section : Cover Story <p> If you 've been investing for a decade or so , you should be well on your way to accumulating your first $50,000 . In fact , you may already have passed that milestone ; an investor who put $200 in stocks each month for the past 10 years and matched the gains of Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index would have amassed some $60,000 by now . <p> Once you have such a sizable portfolio , you can boost your profits by buying individual stocks and bonds . By avoiding mutual funds ' high management costs , you can increase your annual return by more than a percentage point , the equivalent of an extra $500 to $1,000 a year on a $50,000 to $100,000 portfolio . Choosing your own securities carries risk , of course . But by diversifying and avoiding overvalued stocks , you can limit it . <p> With $25,000 , you can make good-size investments in seven or eight different stocks , the smallest number needed for effective diversification . Although smaller trades could subject you to high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of stock are typically less than 5% . Hold the stocks for four years , and your costs will amount to less than the management expenses over the same period with the average fund . <p> You can realize even greater savings on fixed-income investments , beating bond mutual funds ' annual cost in as little as a year . That 's especially noteworthy since long-term bonds are likely to be among your portfolio 's top performers if interest rates fall over the next nine months as many economists expect . <p> The right portfolio mix depends on your appetite for risk . The safest approach calls for splitting your money equally among moderately priced blue chips , high-yield stocks , and long-term Treasury bonds . Not only will such a mix provide income of around 6% a year , but if interest rates fall half a percentage point , you also could earn an additional 5% to 10% in capital gains . <p> If you are willing to take moderate risks to get a whack at 10% annual gains over a five- to 10-year period , raise the portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , investors who are comfortable with a high level of risk may want to include some small growth stocks in place of blue chips and mortgage-backed securities rather than Treasury bonds . And , whatever the risk level of your portfolio , if you are in the top tax brackets , consider municipals , which are likely to give you a higher after-tax return than most other income investments . <p> If you do decide to include riskier investments , you may be better off putting that part of your portfolio in funds , despite the higher long-term costs . That way you 'll get the benefits of extremely broad diversification and professional stock analysis . You should also consider funds as an alternative to conservative securities if you think that you might have to sell in a year or two or if you frequently switch your money from one investment to another . Either eventuality could wipe out the cost advantage that individual stocks and bonds enjoy . <p> John Waters , 44 , and his wife Monique , 43 , of Fort Smith , Ark. have found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 in bank CDs and zero-coupon bonds to help finance college for their three children , they have invested $77,000 in the stock market . Their holdings include about $46,000 in stocks , mostly blue chips such as telephone companies that pay above-average yields . To pump up long-term returns , though , the Waters have also put about $31,000 in funds such as Twentieth Century 's Select and Ultra , which buy the shares of fast-growing firms , and Mutual Shares , whose holdings include the securities of bankrupt companies . " I do n't have time to check on my stocks every day , " says John , " so for volatile investments I go with funds . " <p> After deciding how to structure your portfolio , you 'll need to give attention to the building blocks you 'll use . Here is a run-down of the best opportunities now in each asset category : <p> BLUE-CHIP STOCKS The shares of large , well-established firms are a traditional haven for conservative investors . Recently , however , stock analysts say many may have become over-valued . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $130 since January , is now trading at a price/earnings multiple of 23 , compared with an average P/E of 16.5 for the S &P; 500 . <p> Seek lower multiples . The top choices are stocks with P/Es in the mid-teens and annual earnings growth of 14% or better . Among them : General Electric ( recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $70.25 ) , with annual revenues of $41 billion ; McDonald 's ( NYSE , $35.25 ) , with annual revenues of $6.1 billion ; and $21.4 billion Procter &; Gamble ( NYSE , $87.50 ) . Two no-load mutual funds that buy such shares are Gabelli Growth ( 800-422-3554 ) , with a three-year total return of 78.3% to July 1 , vs. 30.5% for the S &P; 500 over the same period ; and Founders Blue Chip ( 800-525-2440 ) , with a three-year total return of 31.6% . <p> HIGH-YIELD EQUITIES Stocks with payouts above the S &P; 500 's recent yield of 3.4% would be prime beneficiaries of lower interest rates . Because high-yield stocks behave a lot like bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnett , editor of the Value Income Investor ( $295 for 17 issues a year ; 407-629-6102 ) , favors the companies with strong finances that have steadily raised their dividends . For example , $247 million A.T . Cross ( American Stock Exchange , $30.25 ) , 4% yield , a pen manufacturer and luxury retailer , has no debt and increased its payout at a 13% annual rate over the past live years . Burnett also recommends Southwest Water ( recently sold over the counter for $16 ) , 5.5 , yield , a small water utility ( 1989 revenues : $39 million ) that serves Southern California and New Mexico . <p> Richard Evans , director of research for Dow Theory Forecasts ( $212 for 52 issues a year ; 219-931-6480 ) , recommends two natural gas distributors that wilt benefit from rising demand for cleaner fuel : Indiana Energy ( NYSE , $20 ) , 6.4% yield , and South Jersey Industries ( NYSE , $17.75 ) , 8.1% yield . Among funds that invest in shares with high payouts , Don Phillips , editor of Mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 312-427-1985 ) , likes two no-loads , Founder 's Equity Income ( 800-525-2440 ) , which yields 4.6% and has earned a total return of 23.5% over three years , and Lindner Dividend ( 314-727-5305 ) , with a 9.9% yield and a three-year return of 27.2% . <p> NEGLECTED GROWTH STOCKS Many small and midsize companies offer unusual opportunities to pursue big gains at only moderate risk . Institutional investors have focused heavily on blue-chip issues , ignoring smaller firms with annual earnings growth of 15% or better . Shop with care , though . " Many emerging small firms have never been tested by a recession , " warns Peter Schliemann , manager of Babson Enterprise ( 800-422-2766 ) , a top-performing fund with a three-year return of 26.7% that holds small stocks . Schliemann 's favorites include Athey Products ( OTC , $8.75 ) , with a P/E of 9 , the second largest manufacturer of street sweepers with annual sales of $41 million ; $186 million W. H. Brady ( OTC , $31 ) , 12 P/E , the leading manufacturer of nameplates and identification markers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( OTC , $41 ) , 13 P/E , a maker of floor-cleaning machinery . <p> TREASURY SECURITIES Among fixed-income investments , notes and bonds issued by the Treasury are virtually free of credit risk and currently yield 8.2% to 8.4% . Intermediate-term issues that mature in 10 years or less are the most conservative choices . As long as you 're willing to tolerate greater price fluctuations , though , long-term bonds could be a smarter bet . If interest rates decline , you will reap larger capital gains than you would get on short-term issues , Treasuries can be bought commission-free from any Federal Reserve bank or branch ; those with maturities of four years or more are sold in denominations as small as $1,000 . <p> MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES Payments of interest and total principal on these issues , which are fully backed by pools of mortgages , are guaranteed by agencies such as the Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) that have the backing of the federal government . Such securities pay yields as much as a percentage point above those of Treasuries , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are complex . With less than $25,000 , consider a no-load mutual fund such as Benham GNMA Income Fund ( 800-321-8321 ) , which currently yields 8.9% . <p> TAX-EXEMPT BONDS : Municipals recently offered investors in the 28% federal tax bracket or higher ( taxable income of $32,450 or more for couples filing jointly ; $19,450 or more for singles ) yields as much as a percentage point above after-tax yields on corporate bonds of similar maturity and credit risk . It you 're in the 33% bracket , for example , a 6.5% tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable yield of 9.7% . In addition , interest on bonds issued in the state where you reside is typically exempt from state and local taxes , which can add the equivalent of a half a point to your yield in a high-tax state . <p> Some municipal issuers are undergoing financial strain , but you can avoid that risk by purchasing pre-refunded munis , which are backed by escrow accounts of Treasury securities . Christine Carter Lynch , editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory ( $250 for 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Power Authority 11.25% , pre-refunded to be redeemed in 1995 at 103 , which recently yielded 6.5% ; Ocean County , N.J. 8.7% , pre-refunded to be redeemed in 1996 at 102 and yielding 6.6% ; and New York City General Obligation 8.75% , pre-refunded to be redeemed in 1997 at 101.5 , yielding 6.6% . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : John and Monique Waters of Fort Smith , Ark. have $25,000 safely stashed in bonds and CDs for their children 's education . For their own retirement , they have $46,000 invested in eight blue chip stocks and $31,000 in three aggressive stock funds . MAD MONEY <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Since the mid-1980s , some investors have quadrupled their money in dogs  --  as well as in lions and horses , such as the one above , which is expected to fetch $40,000 to $60,000 at a Christie 's East auction of carousel art this October in New York City .
