<p> Despite the looming threat of Proposition 187 , illegal aliens in this northern Guatemala shantytown are doing a lot of California dreaming these days . <p> Last month 's decision by California voters to cancel free health care and other social-service benefits for illegal immigrants is hardly causing a panic among U.S.-bound residents of Tecun Uman , who say that just on the other side of the murky Suchiate River , in Mexico , lie far more formidable obstacles to migration . <p> " One-eighty-seven my butt ! You got ta get through Mexico just to get a chance at 187 , " said Cuban migrant Lazaro Banos , as he jabbed an accusing finger northward and launched into a string of angry English-language expletives . " Man , what they do to you in Mexico is criminal . I 'm taking a gun the next time I go there . " <p> Mexican officials have repeatedly denounced Proposition 187 as a " racist " affront to the dignity and human rights of Mexicans in California , but migrants here say the proposition pales in comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have encountered at the hands of Mexican authorities . <p> Banos , who arrived in Mexico last August aboard a raft from Cuba , said Mexican police beat him , took more than $ 1,000 and other possessions from him and jailed him for four months without charge before dumping him on the banks of the Suchiate . <p> Interviews with 20 other migrants  --  who have congregated here from faraway places such as Peru , Panama and the former Soviet Union  --  suggested that Banos 's experience was more or less typical . <p> A Mexican official involved in immigration affairs acknowledged that " there have been isolated cases of abuses " by authorities . " It 's half and half . We try to work with human rights organizations to reduce the chance of abuses , but , yes , they are still occurring ... . There are some reports of beatings " and of migrants occasionally having been hospitalized , the official said . <p> " Mexico bad , bad , " said Yuri , an Armenian who tried to enter the United States earlier this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Using the broken Spanish he learned while hiding in Tecun Uman with other dispossessed migrants , Yuri described his experience at the hands of Mexican immigration authorities as among the worst of his life  --  next to the killing of his parents , brothers and sisters by Azerbaijani gunmen . <p> " I had two suitcases full of clothes , videotapes and photos of my family , " Yuri explained . " The Mexicans beat me in the face with their fists . They took everything I owned , " including , he said , a gold chain around his neck . <p> Yuri said he was held at a Mexico City migrant-detention center for 26 days before being bused to the border and told to find his own way across the Suchiate into Guatemala . Yuri said he is unable to return home or travel anywhere openly because the Mexicans also seized his passport . <p> " They took all of our passports , " said Washington Ferrin , a migrant from Colombia , as he motioned to Yuri and a half-dozen black men from various Caribbean and Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , and they beat us . Those people are the real racists . " <p> Banos said a Mexican policeman took scissors and destroyed his passport as he watched helplessly . " They do n't want 187 because if the immigrants stop coming , the Mexicans wo n't have anyone to rob anymore , " he added . <p> " Immigration is like a business to the Mexicans , " explained Angel Garcia , a Guatemalan who runs a soft-drink stand catering to migrants near the Suchiate . " Everyone in Central America knows that the hardest country to get through is Mexico . Once you get past them , it 's easy . " <p> Exact figures on illegal migration through Mexico are not available from the government , but Mexico 's National Migration Institute reported this month that 3,651 illegal aliens were deported between January and November . Most of the migrants were from Guatemala , the institute said , while others came from Egypt , India and Bangladesh . <p> Unlike in the United States , where illegal immigrants normally are returned to their countries of origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border point  --  into Guatemala or Belize  --  regardless of the migrants ' origin . <p> Mexican officials say they have no interest in making their country an attractive way station for U.S.-bound immigrants , nor will they accept responsibility for what they regard as a U.S. immigration problem . <p> Mexico made its policy clear in July 1993 , when three shiploads of Chinese seeking entry into the United States languished for two weeks in international waters off Mexico 's northern coast while the U.S. and Mexican governments haggled over which country would accept them . <p> Mexico repeatedly refused until U.S. officials reportedly warned that the then-pending North American Free Trade Agreement could be adversely affected by Mexico 's attitude . Mexico finally agreed to let the 650 Chinese land in the northern port of Ensenada . Then they were handcuffed , their hair was spray-painted green , and they were put on airplanes back to China . <p> According to accounts by deported migrants now living here , the Chinese got off lightly . <p> A Salvadoran 13-year-old boy said he and his 8-year-old brother also were beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas border . His mother , who did not give her name , said they spent several days in detention with little more than bread and water . <p> Juan Gonzalez , an eight-year resident of Miami , said he flew to Mexico in October to meet a sister who had fled Cuba during last summer 's exodus of raft people . When Gonzalez tried to board a plane back to Miami , however , Mexican immigration authorities blocked him after questioning the legality of his U.S. residency documents . <p> Like the others , he said , he was held for weeks at a Mexico City detention center , then bused to the banks of the Suchiate and told to get out of Mexico . <p> Jose Yau Navas , a Panamanian who has a wife and child living in Los Angeles , said that while he was detained in Mexico City , a Colombian woman in the next cell was raped repeatedly by immigration authorities . <p> Dani Cano Dias , 20 , a Honduran who said he was held with Navas in the same detention center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was propositioned several times by Mexican police , who offered to help sneak her into the United States in exchange for sex . <p> Migrants often will pay up to $ 3,000 each to be smuggled aboard trains or trucks from Guatemala to the U.S. border . Instead , however , the smugglers often accept additional payments from Mexican police , then hand the migrants over for arrest and deportation . <p> " I know it is wrong , but I have done this , " said Antonio Hernandez , a former alien smuggler who now resides in Mexico City . He said he also accepted payments earlier this year from U.S. Border Patrol agents for information that led to the capture of scores of illegal aliens whom he had smuggled  --  for a $ 2,500 fee  --  into California only days before . <p> Against that backdrop , various Guatemalan migrant workers here said , the prospect of landing in California without free education or health services seems almost laughably acceptable . <p> " Nobody cares about 187 . You go wherever you can to find work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't risk your life going to the United States just to get free education . " <p> Asked if Mexico applies the same standards to itself that it is asking California to apply , migrant worker Luis Antonio Fuentes shook his head . " The Mexicans treat you like animals , " he said , estimating the average migrant farm worker 's pay in southern Mexico at less than $ 5 a day . There is no free education or social security there , he added . <p> " You can get health care , but you have to pay , " Coronado added . " The doctors are better here anyway . Even the Mexicans come to Guatemala for medical service . "
