Deal Breaker By Harlan Coben Random House Harlan Coben 1 Otto Burke , the Wizard of Schmooze , raised his game another level . " Come on , Myron , " he urged with neoreligious fervor . " I 'm sure we can come to an understanding here . You give a little . We give a little . The Titans are a team . In some larger sense I would like all of us to be a team . You included . Let 's be a real team , Myron . What do you say ? " Myron Bolitar steepled his fingers . He had read somewhere that steepled fingers made you look like a thoughtful person . He felt foolish . " I 'd like nothing more , Otto , " he said , returning the pointless volley for the umpteenth time . " Really I would . But we 've given as much as we can . It 's your turn now . " Otto nodded vigorously , as if he had just heard some philosophical whimsy that put Socrates to shame . He tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's general manager . " Larry , what do you think ? " Taking his cue , Larry Hanson pounded the conference table with a fist hairy enough to be a gerbil . " Bolitar can go to hell ! " he shouted , playing enraged to the hilt . " You hear me , Bolitar ? You understand what I 'm telling you ? Go to hell . " " Go to hell , " Myron repeated with a nod . " Got it . " " You being a wiseass with me ? Huh ? Answer me , dammit ! You being a wiseass ? " Myron looked at him . " You have a poppy seed stuck in your teeth . " " Goddamn wiseass . " " And you 're beautiful when you 're angry.Your whole face lights up . " Larry Hanson 's eyes widened . He swung his line of vision toward his boss , then back to Myron . " You 're out of your league here , Bolitar . And you fucking know it . " Myron said nothing . The truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myron was out of his league . He had been in sports representation for only two years now . Most of his clients were borderline cases-guys who were lucky to make the cut and grabbed the league 's minimum . And football was far from his specialty . He had only three NFL players , only one of whom was a starter . Now Myron sat across from thirty-one-year-old wunderkind Otto Burke , the youngest owner in the NFL , and Larry Hanson , **34;0;TOOLONG , negotiating a contract that even in his inexperienced hands would be the biggest rookie contract in NFL history . Yes , he-Myron Bolitar-had landed Christian " Hot Prop " Steele . Two-time Heisman trophy-winning quarterback . Three straight AP and UPI number-one rankings . All-American four years in a row . If that was n't enough , the kid was an endorsement wet dream . An A student , good-looking , articulate , polite , and white ( hey , it mattered ) . Best of all , he was Myron 's . " The offer is on the table , gentlemen , " Myron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Otto Burke shook his head . " It 's a load of crap ! " Larry Hanson shouted . " You 're a goddamn idiot , Bolitar . You 're going to flush this kid 's career down the toilet . " Myron spread his arms . " How about a group hug ? " Larry was about to offer up another expletive , but Otto stopped him with a raised hand . In Larry 's playing days Dick Butkus and Ray Nitzchke could n't stop him with body blows . Now this one-hundred-fifty-pound Harvard grad could silence him with but a wave . Otto Burke leaned forward . He had n't stopped smiling , had n't stopped the hand gestures , had n't stopped the eye contact-like an Anthony Robbins Personal Power infomercial come to life . Disconcerting as all hell . Otto was a small , fragile-looking man with the tiniest fingers Myron had ever seen . His hair was dark and heavy-metal long , flowing to his shoulders . He was baby-faced with a silly goatee that looked as if it 'd been sketched on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it just appeared long against his tiny fingers . " Now , Myron , " Otto said , " let 's speak rationally here , okay ? " " Rationally . Let 's . " " Great , Myron , that 'll be helpful . The truth is , Christian Steele is an unknown , untested quantity . He has n't even put on a pro uniform yet . He may be the bust of the century . " Larry snorted . " You should know something about that , Bolitar-about players who amount to nothing . Who crap out . " Myron ignored him . He had heard the insult before . It no longer bothered him . Sticks and stones and all that . " We are talking about perhaps the greatest quarterback prospect in history , " he replied steadily . " You made three trades and gave up six players to get his rights . You did n't do all that if you did n't believe he has what it takes . " " But this proposal " - Otto stopped , looked up as though searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sound . " " Crap is more like it , " Larry added . " It 's final , " Myron said . Otto shook his head , the smile unfazed . " Let 's talk this through , okay ? Let 's look at it from every conceivable angle . You 're new at this , Myron-an ex-jock reaching for the executive brass ring . I respect that . You 're a young guy trying to give it a go . Heck , I admire that . Really . " Myron bit down . He could have pointed out that he and Otto were the same age , but he so loved being patronized . Did n't everybody ? " If you make a mistake on this , " Otto continued , " it could be the sort of thing that destroys your career . Do you know what I mean ? Plenty of people already feel that you 're not up to this-to handling such a high-profile client . Not me , of course . I think you 're a very bright guy . Shrewd . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head like a teacher disenchanted with a favorite pupil . Larry stood , glowering down at Myron . " Why do n't you give the kid some good advice ? " he said . " Tell him to get a real agent . " Myron had expected this whole good-cop , bad-cop routine . He had , in fact , expected worse ; Larry Hanson had not yet attacked the sexual appetites of anyone 's mother . Still , Myron preferred the bad cop to the good cop . Larry Hanson was a frontal assault , easily spotted and handled . Otto Burke was the snake-infested high grass with buried land mines . " Then I guess we have nothing more to discuss , " Myron said . " I believe a holdout would be unwise , Myron , " Otto said . " It might soil Christian 's squeaky-clean image . Hurt his endorsements . Cost you both a great deal of money . You do n't want to lose money , Myron . " Myron looked at him . " I do n't ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ? " He picked up a pencil and began scribbling . " Do n't . . . want . . . to . . . lose . . . money . " He grinned at both men . " Am I picking up pointers today or what ? " Larry mumbled , " Goddamn wiseass . " Otto 's smile remained locked on autopilot . " If I may be so bold , " he continued , " I would think Christian would want to collect quickly . " " Oh ? " " There are those who have serious reservations about Christian Steele 's future . There are those " - Otto drew deeply on his cigarette- " who believe he may have had something to do with that girl 's disappearance . " " Ah , " Myron said , " that 's more like it . " " More like what ? " " You 're starting to fling mud . For a second there I thought I was n't asking for enough . " Larry Hanson stuck a thumb in Myron 's direction . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ? You raise a legitimate issue about Christian 's ex-bimbo , one that goes to the heart of his value as a public relations commodity- " " Pitiful rumors , " Myron interrupted . " No one believed them . If anything , they made the public more sympathetic to Christian 's tragedy . And do n't call Kathy Culver a bimbo . " Larry raised an eyebrow . " Well , well , are n't we touchy , " he said , " for a low-life pissant . " Myron 's expression did not change . He had met Kathy Culver five years ago when she was a sophomore in high school , already a budding beauty . Like her sister Jessica . Eighteen months ago Kathy had mysteriously vanished from the campus of Reston University . To this day no one knew where she was or what had happened to her . The story had all the media 's favorite tasty morsels-a gorgeous co-ed , the fiance of football star Christian Steele , the sister of novelist Jessica Culver , a strong hint of sexual assault for extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked like ravenous relatives around a buffet table . But just recently a second tragedy had befallen the Culver family . Adam Culver , Kathy 's father , had been murdered three nights earlier in what police were calling a " botched robbery . " Myron wanted very much to contact the family , to do more than merely offer simple condolences , but he had decided to stay away , not knowing if he was welcome , fairly certain he was n't . " Now if- " There was a knock on the door . It opened a crack , and Esperanza stuck her head in . " Call for you , Myron , " she said . " Take a message . " " I think you 'll want to take it . " Esperanza stayed in the doorway . Her dark eyes gave away nothing , but he understood . " I 'll be right there , " he said . She slipped back through the door . Larry Hanson gave an appreciative whistle . " She 's a babe , Bolitar . " " Gee , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He rose . " I 'll be right back . " " We do n't have all goddamn day to jerk off here . " " I 'm sure you do n't . " He left the conference room and met up with Esperanza at her desk . " The Meal Ticket , " she told him . " He said it was urgent . " Christian Steele . From her petite frame most would not guess that Esperanza used to be a professional wrestler . For three years she had been known on the circuit as Little Pocahontas . The fact that Esperanza Diaz was Latina , without a trace of American Indian blood , did not seem to bother the FLOW ( Fabulous Ladies of Wrestling ) organization . A minor detail , they said . Latino , Indian , what 's the difference ? At the height of her pro wrestling career , the same script was played out every week in arenas all over the U.S. of A. Esperanza ( " Pocahontas " ) would enter the ring wearing moccasins , a suede-fringed dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her dark face . The suede dress came off before the fight , leaving a somewhat flimsier and less traditional Native American garb in its stead . Professional wrestling has a pretty simple plot with painfully few variations . Some wrestlers are bad . Some are good . Pocahontas was good , a crowd favorite . She was cute and small and quick and had a tight little body . Everyone loved her . She would always be winning the fight on skill when her opponent would do something illegal-throw sand in her eyes , use a dreaded foreign object that everyone in the free world except the referee could see-to turn the tide . Then the bad wrestler would bring in a couple of extra cronies , ganging up three against one on poor Pocahontas , pounding mercilessly on the brave beauty to the unequivocal shock and chagrin of the announcers , who had seen the same thing happen last week and the week before . Just when it seemed there was no hope , Big Chief Mama , a mammoth creature , charged out of the locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together Big Chief Mama and Little Pocahontas would defeat the forces of evil . Massively entertaining . " I 'll take it in my office , " Myron said . As he entered he saw the nameplate on his desk , a gift from his parents . MYRON BOLITAR SPORTS AGENT He shook his head . Myron Bolitar . He still could n't believe someone would name a kid Myron . When his family first moved to New Jersey , he had told everyone in his new high school that his name was Mike . Nope , no dice . Then he tried to nickname himself Mickey . Unh-unh . Everyone reverted to Myron ; the name was like a horror-movie monster that would not die . To answer the obvious question : No , he never forgave his parents . He picked up the phone . " Christian ? " " Mr. Bolitar ? Is that you ? " " Yes . And please call me . . . Myron . " Acceptance of the inevitable , a sign of a wise man . " I 'm sorry to interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm busy negotiating your contract . I have Otto Burke and Larry Hanson in the next room . " " I appreciate that , Mr. Bolitar , but this is very important . " His voice was trembling . " I have to see you right away . " He switched hands . " Something wrong , Christian ? " Mr. Perceptive . " I-I 'd rather not discuss it over the phone . Would you be able to meet me at my room on campus ? " " Sure , no problem . What time ? " " Now , please . I-I do n't know what to make of this . I want you to see it . " Myron took a deep breath . " No problem . I 'll throw Otto and Larry out . It 'll be good for the negotiations . I 'll be there in an hour . " It took a lot longer . Myron entered the Kinney garage on Forty-sixth Street , not too far from his Park Avenue office . He nodded to Mario , the garage attendant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclaimer on the bottom that read " not including 97% tax , " and headed to his car on the lower level . A Ford Taurus . Your basic Babe Magnet . He was about to unlock the door when he heard a hissing sound . Like a snake . Or more likely , air escaping from a tire . The sound emanated from his back right tire . A quick examination told Myron that it had been slashed . " Hi , Myron . " He spun around . Two men grinned at him . One was the size of a small Third World nation . Myron was big-nearly six-four and two hundred twenty pounds-but he guessed that this guy must have been six-six and closing in on three hundred . A heavy-duty weight lifter , his whole body was puffed up as if he were wearing inflatable life vests under his clothes . The second man was of average build . He wore a fedora. &lt; Continues ...
