Leon woke up smelling the past . The past smelled rank , a funky odor : sex , sweat , and broth , a foul soupy cafeteria smell , or worse . He needed to remember it , the time and place where the smell originated , but could not . It was important , crucial , but it was impossible . He felt like crying , and then he did cry . He choked back the sobs , but could not hold back the tears . He was wracked with pointless nostalgia and then by freefloating remorse . It made no sense . <p> He rolled toward Maisy , his wife , thinking she might be the source of the smell . She was sleeping on her back , snoring lightly with her mouth open . He leaned close to her face and inhaled her breath . He slid the blanket down and sniffed her body , beginning with her armpits and moving to her neck and breasts . He sniffed her navel and pubic tuft . He sniffed her knees , and finally her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She woke up , muttering , " What are you doing , Leon ? Stop that . Where are my blankets ? " <p> " Sorry , " he said . <p> " You have to see a doctor , " she said . " I mean it . " <p> " It 's not medical , " he said . " It ca n't be just a medical thing . " <p> " It is medical . It is a medical thing . " <p> Maisy got out of bed and found her robe . She grappled with it , looking for the armholes . Leon still desired her , though her belly in recent years had gotten large . It fell like a roll of silver-white dough over the long horizontal scar from a decades-old hysterectomy . The fine geometry of her face was becoming obscured by thickened flesh . Her hair was thin and mostly gray and her eyes had lost the startling blue urgency they 'd had when he first met her thirty years ago . Even though she was sixty-six , time 's relentless anvil had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woman he 'd married-the dancer with the long-legged twirl , her lean back descending in a subtle arch to the abrupt hillocks of her firm rump , the wide generous breasts , the smooth neck , and the classic planes and hollows of her lovely face . <p> The smell that woke him up was fading . It had not come from his wife , he knew that now . Alone in bed , he smelled himself , his pits , his wrists and hands . He was still limber enough to pull his pale white feet up to his nose , but he had no odors at all . The odors-fumes , reallythat he had smelled had n't come from anything in his present surroundings . They had come to him from the past , like a memory , a memory without images . The odor lacked a name and the feeling that if he could only pin it down-soup , sweat , candle wax , glue , sulfurous tar , the gamy residue of sex-then something momentous would be revealed to him , something linked to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time he got out of bed and brushed his teeth , it was reduced to a memory of a memory , insubstantial as a pointless dream . None of it made sense . <p> He joined his wife in the kitchen . She 'd already finished making coffee and was reading the paper at the table . He poured himself a cup and sat down . He inhaled the steam rising from his cup but could not smell the good coffee aroma . He went to the pantry and found the can of coffee and removed the plastic lid . He inhaled deeply , his nose almost touching the rich dark grounds , but he smelled nothing . <p> " It 's completely gone , is n't it ? Your sense of smell . " Maisy said , studying him now . <p> He sat down , sipped his coffee . " I could smell it even after I was awake , " he said . " It lasted about a minute , then it went . Same smell , every morning . I ca n't pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Something 's not right . " <p> " It ca n't amount to much , Maisy . " <p> " You walk around the house trying to smell things . The other day I saw you light a match and inhale the sulfur . Only someone who could n't smell would do a thing like that . " <p> " Maybe it 's just an allergy , a temporary thing , " he said , making a show of inhaling coffee steam with unrestrained pleasure . " The mulberry trees are budding out now . You know how bad that pollen can be . " <p> Maisy sighed . " I do n't like being waked up like that , Leon . I do n't want you smelling me every morning . It gives me the willies . Something 's wrong with you . " <p> " Nothing 's wrong with me , " Leon said . " I feel fine . A lot of people lose their ability to smell things . I 'm sixty-five . I ca n't see as well as I could twenty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want a doctor to look at you just in case . I 'm thinking a neurologist . " <p> " It is n't a medical problem , " he said . " How could it be a medical problem ? " <p> " Milder symptoms than that are medical . I 'm going to call the clinic . " Maisy had been an army nurse , and had served in Korea and then again , after an interlude as a surgical nurse in Tucson , in Vietnam . <p> Leon chuckled , shaking his head , but it was an act . He felt like crying again . It was frightening , this sudden deprivation of one of his senses . He remembered being inducted into the army , a hundred naked boys bending over and spreading their cheeks for the examining doctors , the overpowering anal stink misting his eyes and making him gag . Oh ! if only he could smell those scared young sphincters again ! <p> The loss was frightening , but it was more frightening that he would receive powerful smells in his dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them still present , his heart pounding and his mind reaching back for something in the distant past that cried out for recognition . It was like a blind man waking up from strongly textured visual dreams in which an unidentifiable scene from his past presented itself and continued to present itself in the minutes after he was fully awake , mimicking restored sight . <p> Maisy opened the morning paper . " I think you 're having seizures of some kind , " she said , scanning headlines . <p> Leon put on his sweats and walked down to the work-out room , angry at Maisy ' s casual diagnosis , a diagnosis that implied a serious medical condition . He looked forward to working out his anger on the weight machine . One of the reasons they had moved to this new retirement community-Sierra del Monte-was the splendid exercise facilities . A personal trainer was available , but Leon preferred to work out using his own routine . The trainer held group sessions in the afternoon . Leon worked out in the morning . <p> Dick Drake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dick was a big man with long scraggly white hair that still showed shocks of red in random patches . He stood like a stone image contemplating , it seemed , the lat machine . Leon knew him well enough to give him a nickname . He called Drake " Rasputin . " Drake , in turn , called Leon " Captain . " Leon assumed this was because of his silver crew-cut and for the pressed khaki slacks he wore exclusively . <p> Drake , in his early seventies , had a recent heart transplant and was exercising now under his doctor 's orders . He was broad-shouldered , slim-hipped , and tall , a one-time college basketball player . He enjoyed his special status as a transplant patient . He told the details of his operation to anyone who would listen-how the heart-lung machine 's connection to his aorta had failed and how his blood left red slicks on the operating room floor . Drake was full of life and bravado and endless talk . He had neither self-pity nor conceit , which , Leon thought , ennobled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm defibrillating , " he said to Leon 's greeting . " I 've got to stand still . " <p> Leon sat down at the leg press and started exercising . There was too much weight on the rack , but he did n't stop to change it . After half a dozen presses , he quit . Drake was still standing in front of the lat machine as his defibrillator hammered spikes of voltage into his misfiring heart . <p> " Son of a bitch , " Drake said , touching the bulge in his side where the defibrillator had been implanted . <p> " You okay ? " Leon said . <p> " Sometimes I feel like I 'm on a high wire stretched over Niagara Falls . " <p> Drake 's forehead was yellow as wax . His grand nose hooked out of his face like a damaged keel . He grinned , his pale eyes alive and merry under shaggy gray eyebrows . " What do you say we trash this for today and go out for a plate of bacon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flexed the biceps . The lumpy muscles bucked erratically under the sagging skin . " I 'm in good enough shape to miss a day . What do you say , Captain ? " <p> Maisy would n't go with them . She did n't want to hear Drake describe his operation again . Leon showered , put on his gabardine slacks and a Hawaiian shirt , then walked to the Lanai room , one of three cafeterias in the Sierra del Monte complex . Drake was already there , seated at a table . He had n't changed out of his sweats . Leon pulled out a chair and sat down . <p> " You did n't have to dress up for me , Captain , " Drake said . " I did n't , " Leon said . <p> A pretty waitress came by , a girl just out of high school . Leon ordered corned beef hash and poached eggs . Drake asked for the fruit plate . " Damn , " Drake said , leaning sideways to watch as the girl moved briskly between the tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonsense all over again , Captain ? " <p> " She 's a baby , Rasputin , " Leon said . <p> " I was a baby once , too , " Drake said gravely . His collapsed lips drooped into a sad inverse smile . " What 's wrong ? " Leon said . <p> " I feel so goddamned useless . How come Dick Drake gets a brand new heart when he ca n't do anything with it anyway ? I 'm just waiting to die , like the rest of us . Seems like a waste . " <p> Drake never talked like this . " Something 's bothering you , " Leon said . <p> " I think the Nigerian wants his heart back , Captain . " <p> Leon knew that Drake 's heart had come from a Nigerian cab driver , killed in a head-on collision in Washington D.C. The Nigerian was twenty-eight years old at the time of his death . His heart was flown to El Paso from D.C. in four hours . Except for the heart-lung machine problem , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leon said . <p> Drake shrugged . " Off and on . Nigerians are big on ghosts . Maybe the cabby feels he ca n't break away from the earthly bonds until his heart is buried , too . " <p> " Mumbo jumbo , Rasputin , " Leon said , though he did not think Drake 's superstitious fear was unreasonable . He was tempted to let apparitions , visitations , or vibrations in the ether account for the phantom odors he woke up to every morning . <p> Drake raised his napkin to his face . He coughed and something came up . He folded the napkin and put it on his plate . " I 'm okay " he said . " Sometimes when I retch I can put pressure on the vagus nerve . That makes it quit . " <p> The young waitress came by and leaned over their table . " Is everything okay , guys ? " she asked . <p> Her thick auburn hair , electrified by the dry desert air , fell inches from Leon 's face . He closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not smell her fragrance . <p> " I was as good as dead , " Drake said to the waitress . " Now look at me . " He opened his shirt and showed her his smooth wide scar . He raised his arms and made the gnarly biceps leap . The shadow of melancholy and doubt that had obscured his optimistic nature had passed . " I 'm going to live forever , honey , " he said . <p> Leon got up and went into the men 's room . He stood in front of a urinal . Before he unzipped he tried to smell the powerfully astringent deodorant bar that lay next to the drain . He knelt in front of the urinal and breathed in the fumes . His eyes watered but he smelled nothing . <p> A man in a wheelchair rolled into the men 's room . " Are you okay , buddy ? " he said . <p> Leon stood up , embarrassed . " Fine , " he said . " I 'm fine . " Age had not made Maisy lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little staying power . " Sorry , " he said , breathing hard . He rolled away from her . " I 'm short on wind these days . " <p> " Do n't worry , " Maisy said . " I 'm not going to start trolling the playgrounds for teenage distance runners . " <p> They both laughed . It had been a good marriage . They had no children and were content with that . Maisy had been thirty-six when they got married , Leon thirty-five . Ten years before that , Maisy had been married briefly to an army officer . <p> They took a shower together . Leon put his face directly under the spray . He smelled roses in the steam . The showerhead ovewhelmed him in fragrance . He stepped back , startled . " Is that your shampoo , Maisy ? " <p> " What are you talking about ? " she said . " I 'm not shampooing yet . " <p> It was roses and more than roses . He could almost remember the place-a river bank , maybe a lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gathering of some kind , people he knew but could not name . There were voices among the roses , by the river or lake , and the familiar house , a handsome place tucked in green hills , was full of music and roses , thousands of roses . He 's here , he heard someone say . Someone else said , Sure enough . <p> He fell to a squat on the tiles , shaking . Maisy turned off the water and left the shower . When she came back she toweled him dry . " I 've called for an ambulance , " she said . <p> " I 'm okay , " Leon said , standing up . " I almost remembered it that time , Maisy . " Tears rolled down his face and his voice shook . <p> " There 's nothing to remember , " she said . " You had a seizure , a bigger one this time . " <p> " Maybe heaven , " he said . " Maybe heaven smells like flowers and the houses are full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Take it easy , hon , " Maisy said . " They 'll be here in a minute . " <p> It was an aneurysm . A bulging vein , dangerously fragile , had pressed hard against a branch of the olfactory nerve . The pressure the aneurysm had exerted on the brain had also stimulated the seizures . The seizuresthe nostalgia-rich odors of nowhere-stopped after the operation . And after a while his sense of smell came back . Leon was able to smell ordinary , everyday things again , but his dreams were odorless . Stripped of fragrance , they no longer had the power to draw him into haunting and familiar landscapes where people he recognized but did not know welcomed him . He missed this , which was foolish , and made no sense . <p> He wore a cap to hide his shaved head . A long red arc traveled from his right temple , across the top of his skull , ending just over his left eye . He wanted to show Dick Drake his scar , wanted to bore him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that Drake had been taken back to the hospital where he 'd received his heart transplant . <p> Leon visited him . Drake 's Nigerian heart was failing rapidly and he was waiting for a new donor . <p> " Jesus , I hope this time they give me the heart of a goddamn Swede . Swedes do n't believe in ghosts , do they , Captain ? " <p> Leon went along with it . " You want a Swiss heart , Rasputin . The goddamn Swiss only believe in money . " <p> They were out in an open-air plaza between buildings . Fast-moving springtime clouds moved them in and out of shade . Dick Drake sat bundled in a wheelchair . He looked thin and wasted , but his spirits were high . <p> " The Nigerian 's calling it in , " he said . He looked up , as if he could see the Nigerian cabby gesturing among the clouds . " He ca n't travel without his heart . " <p> Leon stopped at a flower shop on his way home . He bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yellows and pinks . The roses filled the car with perfume . It was a happy smell , the fragrance of optimism and hope , a fragrance that would be welcome in anyone 's idea of heaven . <p> He knew he did not need to , but he wanted to win her heart again . He wanted to win her heart every day for whatever time they had left together . It made no sense , but it did n't have to . Nothing had to . <p>
