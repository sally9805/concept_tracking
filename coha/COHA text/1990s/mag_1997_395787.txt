What is it about island guys that makes grown women go gaga ? // He comes to me on the beach when I am content to just stare at the Caribbean Sea and dig my toe into the sand . But as he leans down , I see his skin shining in the sun like a polished chestnut . Then he tells me he 's been watching me , been thinking about me hard . " You is de prettiest girl in de worl ' I ever seen . Yeah . to have an ' to hol From the first time I bless my eyes on you , I felt a tingling all over me body . " I dig my toe deeper into the sand and try not to laugh because , I mean , really . I see him on the beach the next day . and the next . Bare-chested and barefoot , he looks strong and healthy . He 's nothing like the city boy I promised myself I would get over . Every day he brings me a bouquet of sweet words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He says I make him feel joy " pon me heart . " Then one afternoon he slides over and gently rests his hand on the back of my neck . I do n't tell him to move it , I just smile and watch the sun go down . My Jamaican guy makes me feel warm all over . For years , since way before Stella got her groove back , women have been traveling to tropical islands for some R &R; only to find themselves swept up in a crazy fling they swear they 'd never let happen in their " real lives . " Even Mrs. Brown , my friend 's mother , tells me she got it on with a beautiful Jamaican man in 1974 . Back then , Mrs. Brown says , " Everyone knew Jamaica was the place for women to have affairs . I had propositions all over the place and flattery , flattery , flattery . " With its high volume of tourism ( more than half a million women visited the island last year ) , Jamaica may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you could name nearly any heavenly island and some woman somewhere is probably giggling about it right now . Over the last 20 years , tourism to the Caribbean has tripled to more than 15 million visitors annually . And by all accounts , the number of women traveling alone has skyrocketed . " More women are financially independent now , and they feel like they deserve to treat themselves , " says Phyllis Stoller , founder of the Miami-based Women 's Travel Club . THE " WOMAN SPECIALISTS " I 've been going to Jamaica for years ; I have family there . Almost every time I 'm at the beach I get approached by some smooth-talking beach bum telling me how pretty or sexy or cute I am . Call me crazy , but I always thought it was just happening to me . Clearly I was wrong . But if this is a national phenomenon , what is it about these guys that makes otherwise sane women-such as me-go gaga ? I find yet another clue on a strip of beach in Ocho Rios where you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys , who all have American superstud nicknames like John Wayne , Chuck Norris , Tarzan and Kirk Douglas , walk up and down the beach rustling up business and flirting with tourists . It 's these guys who tell me that Jamaica is simply a nation of " woman specialists . " " Jamaican men treat women the way they are supposed to be treated . We have more deep emotional feelings , " explains Big Mack , one of the glass-bottom-boat operators . " You always try to show dem de good tings , " says Rocky , who repairs jet skis . " You take dem to de different sight scen'ry . Let dem have good times so dey respek you , dey likes you . Eventually it turns into a bigga bashment party . I got woman galore . Dat 's automatically sure . As dey see me , dey start to scream out fe me . " Oh , these men have lyrics . Delivered in anything from lilting British-inflected accents to rough and rugged patois , they are so over the top , so relentless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than complete incredulity : Hey slimness , hey sweetness , hey sugaplum . . . Me like you . Me love you . Babee , you look suh nice an ' sweet , so young an ' sexy . You favah an angel , like you excape from heaven . You is de woman of my dream . Me like yuh style , yuh profile . Would n't yuh like to try me good lovin ' ' ? Rocky is a supreme woman specialistand the word is he 's got the love letters to prove it . I chase him down for a whole week , begging him to let me see them . Finally he hands them over . He 's got a plastic shopping bag filled with neatly folded letters from women in Great Britain and the United States , all postmarked from last winter . One letter says , " You always make me feel so special . I need your love because it helps me see how beautiful the world can be . " Another says , " I do n't want a cheap wedding . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife . " A third says , " Please do n't send your letters to my house , it would be awkward . I hope you understand . " Rocky understands . " They love me like hot choc'lit , " he says . But it 's more than the chocolate-loverman vibe that captures the hearts of foreign women . It 's that on vacation , everything is perfect : You are n't the woman who lost the promotion , who ca n't keep a man , who should have been on that diet yesterday . You are exactly what the gorgeous man on the beach says you arena shining beauty , a princess , a stargirl . And that feels delicious . Ask anyone who 's been there and they 'll tell you unequivocally : Caribbean men have a broader appreciation of the female form . If you have a few wrinkles , some extra pounds and breasts that have seen perkier days , there is still someone who will call you beautiful . " The men in Jamaica will tell you exactly what you need to hear no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my British cousin , as we stroll along the beach one afternoon . " If you 're 300 pounds it 's " Wha'ppen ' ' , beautiful ? " It does n't matter where your self-esteem is , it will rise ten feet by the time you leave . " In short , there 's someone to love you just for you : " Many of us are just so hungry for the kind of attention they shower us with , " says Julia A. Boyd , author of Embracing the Fire : Sisters Talk About Sex and Relationships ( Dutton , 1997 ) . " In the United States , we place a lot of emphasis on how people look . " Good " hair , light eyes , European features and thinness are so played up that if you do n't have those qualities you feel as if you 're not okay in some basic way . " " It seems like the men here were born to please women , " laughs Karle , a 40-year-old computer programmer . " When you are with them , they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Karle is one happy sister . She has her own island honey . He 's only 22 but he makes her feel like a stargirl . The two met at a dance last October and spent three days together , and when Karle got back home she promptly racked up a $2,900 phone bill . But that big grin on her face when she looks at her man , points out his dimples and rolls her eyes to the heavens with a cascade of wild giggles tells me that , for her , it 's all worth it . " My baby 's just very , very considerate , " she purrs . But it 's not just the attentiveness of Caribbean men that melts our hearts . Women tell me it 's the way their man is " connected to nature " and " nurturing but still manly " that really sends them over the top . I just smile and nod because my man can catch a fly in midair , cook me dinner , sail a boat and sit on the edge of the bed sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? But Carol , an American who works as a Tarot-card reader at a fancy hotel in Jamaica , is over her love jones . Twenty years ago , she did what many tourist women are still doing-she vacationed on the island , met a man , fell in love , returned home and went bananas . " You write them , you send them stuff , you obsess , you go crazy , " she says : She ended up going back to Jamaica , marrying her boyfriend , taking him to the States and adopting his two children-then getting divorced and moving back to Jamaica without him . " I think it 's really impossible for these relationships to last . We have one set of expectations and Jamaicans have another . " Her main complaint with her ex is that " his whole plan , which he did not make perfectly clear to me , was to get out of Jamaica . " MONEY , HONEY While foreign women may love the attention and adoration a Caribbean man doles out , his main objective may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send him money " from foreign . " For other men , hooking up with a smitten tourist means being able to pay his children 's school fees or getting a decent night 's sleep in a comfortable bed . It 's not love but economics that keeps many of these men hanging on . In a developing country such as Jamaica , all Americans seem rich . A full-time hotel worker might only make about $70 U.S. a week , roughly the cost of a pair of shoes . So is n't it only fair that if a guy is going to take you out , show you a good time and be your companion for the week , you should pay ? Not only for your entertainment but maybe for a portable CD player as well ? For many women , it 's difficult to say no once a man starts asking for money . For some men the ultimate payoff is not just money but also making it to the States or England or Canada , where the economic opportunities seem boundless . " My sense is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated or have n't finished high school , so this is one of their only options , " explains April Gorry , who 's working on her Ph.D . in anthropology at the University of California , Santa Barbara . Her dissertation subject : " romance tourism . " DO THE HUSTLE Negril was once a quiet fishing village on Jamaica 's west coast , but with its seven miles of continuous beach and scores of recently built luxury hotels , Negril has blossomed into a mecca for young , single travelers . When it comes to beach hustling , Negril has got to be the world 's capital . I met Arlington there , where he works at one of the hotels . When I told him about my research , he offered to take me to the popular Rick 's Cafe to watch the hustling . Arlington broke it down for me . He pointed to a not-bad-looking guy cuddling a very plump White woman with glasses . " He do n't deal with the pretty girls ; what he dates is the older fat girls . The ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , she meets him on the beach and she knows he do n't have the money . But CONTINUED ON PACE 162 he 'll hold hands with her and act like they 're married . He 'll tell her things she likes to hear , like Baby , I really like you , we 're going to get engaged . ' Once they make love , he 's in control . " That 's when the money starts to flow . " Money to go shopping , a couple of tires for the car , shoes , whatever . " Arlington says lots of hustlers do n't bother with African-American women because we 're too much work . " They 're cheap . They go to a restaurant and ask for separate tabs , " he says with disgust . Other women , explains Arlington , " got no man and they heard Black men are good lovers . It 's worth it to them to spend what they have . " All around Negril are young Jamaican men holding , whispering to and grinding against older women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the disco one night I see a middle-aged woman hike up her dress and rub her pantied bottom against the groin of some Jamaican muscle man . " It 's as if they come here and lose all their inhibitions , " says Anne , who has worked in the Negril tourist industry for the past four years . " Can you picture these women taking home a poor Rasta man in their country ? No . " On the first day Arlington plays tour guide , I 'm thinking , Gee , what a helpful guy . By the second afternoon , though , he starts telling me about this " real sweet " American girl who came to visit . One night she got a cash advance on her credit card and handed him $400 to pay for them to go out , he says . " When we got back to her hotel she did n't even ask me for the change , " he says , grinning . Now Arlington wants me to get a cash advance on my credit card . I tell him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about his Japanese girlfriend who gave him a car stereo with a little remote he has attached with Velcro to the dashboard . I tell him I still do n't have any money . This goes on for a while until I 'm in tears , insisting that in America men do n't ask me for money ; they take me out . And Arlington says , " Well , you 're not in America . " And that 's the end of my guided tour . In Negril , relationships are often business . And what 's worse , I get the feeling that many people think tourist women-even those who get wooed into spending thousands of dollars on some hustling hunk-are getting exactly what they deserve . Just ask some of the Jamaican women . " Female tourists just leave themselves open to be taken advantage of , " insists Norma , who has worked in the travel industry for 12 years . Her attitude is hardly surprising . For thousands of women who live near the beach , good-time women foreigners can be nothing but trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife and children . And then the opportunity to become involved with a tourist comes up and the children suffer , " says Norma . " The tourist provides him with whatever luxury he needs , and the Jamaican woman ends up losing her husband . These relationships cause her a lot of pain , stress , strain , you name it . If a Jamaican woman is not treating a tourist right , it 's most likely because of that . " Who 's Bad ? " The women are just looking for the big bamboo , " says Pinky , a pretty young woman from Ocho Rios . " They are as bad as the men . " Are they as bad as the men ? And are the men really that bad ? The mythology is that the men are heartless , whoring hustlers and the women are sluts or fools or both . But if you ask me , most of these relationships are completely symbiotic-he gives her something that makes her happy , she gives him something that makes him happy . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection speaks volumes about Jamaica 's economic deficits and America 's social one . Whether it tells us anything about the inherent " wrongness " of these relationships is another matter entirely . There are plenty of Black women who can tick off on their fingers the ways in which they are overlooked and underappreciated at work , at home and in bed . Is it really any surprise that when presented with unbridled adoration these women lap it up ? " This is n't a morality issue , " Julia Boyd argues . " It 's about feeling good enough about yourself to be able to have some fun and have a fleeting relationship . Men have these all the time . For guys it 's always about sowing their wild oats . For women it 's always about This has to lead somewhere . ' We feel that in order to have a casual relationship , in order for it to be okay , we have to love this person on some level . " Some women are sent reeling into months of heartbreak and debt . But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a relationship with someone she barely knows ? " People come down here and they lose all their caution . They just dash it to one side , " sighs Cassie , who is still with the Jamaican man she moved from Wisconsin to marry 17 years ago . Cassie says she marvels at how little women consider the particulars before they get involved with guys from the beach . " If this person is spending all day on the beach , if he drops everything in his life to spend a week with you , you have to ask yourself , How is he doing that ? You 've got to look at that guy as you would at an American sitting next to you in a bar . " Cassie says the women who get hit the hardest are the ones who think they 've found paradise . " Paradise does n't exist , " she says . " It 's a lot of hard work . " Fortunately , most stargirls seem to have the good sense to practice safe sex in their pursuit of paradise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Health 's HIV/STD control program , " Female tourists tend to insist on condoms . It 's so much the norm that sometimes the men get suspicious if the woman does n't insist on a condom . " Lovette says the majority of Jamaica 's 2,184 reported AIDS cases and more than 40,000 reports of STDs are in metropolitan , not tourist , areas . " Our cases are local cases , " she explains , " often brought in by migrant farmworkers or Jamaicans who were traveling or living abroad . " So , though most tourists wo n't return home with a pesky STD , there are plenty of sad stories to go around : the maxed-out credit card , the unanswered letters , the crushing realization that you 're not the only one . But for some women , holding on to an illusion of paradise-no matter the cost-is preferable to emotionally disengaging from a holiday romance . When you have a fling , you bring home with you a rough sketch of a fantasy ( did I mention that my Jamaican guy wants to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a baby ? ) , which you inevitably start to fill in with vivid colors ( our baby would be beautiful ! ) . I know the temptation is to hang on to that feeling by hanging on to the man . I know the trick is not to give in . I know I should hold my memories close to my heart and get on with my life . But what do I really know ? Behind my computer , buried under a stack of bills and unfinished work , is an airline ticket back to Jamaica .
