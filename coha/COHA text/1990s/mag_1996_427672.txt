Section : Focus on your Money It 's that time of year again . Here 's how to power up your investment pot  --  and avoid some some unexpected pitfalls  --  BY ELLYN E. SPRAGINS <p> OUR INSTINCTS TELL US THAT crashing markets pose the gravest danger to our 401(k)s , those gilt-edged employer-sponsored retirement plans that have become the new nest eggs for some 23 million or more Americans . But in fact , a cocky , record-busting stock market  --  like the one we 've had for the last 23 months  --  can be just as hazardous . Rare is the human who can simply count the blessing of a 21 percent return , hard on the heels of last year 's 37.4 percent , and be done with it . No , when you see those numbers you feel compelled to do two things : either grab the money and run , or dump even more of your retirement bucks into the market  --  so you do n't miss out on the next great ride . <p> Restrain yourself . This is the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill out all those bothersome 401(k) investment forms . As you do , remember : your job is to implement a plan , not outwit a fiendishly unpredictable market . Self-discipline will be paramount this year because the future is so cloudy . Will the economy continue to serve up that golden elixir  --  robust corporate profits mixed with quiescent inflation  --  that makes the market dance ? Or must all good things , bountiful economies and spectacular stock markets included , come to an end ? And now that we 're high-return junkies , what are the alternatives to U.S. stocks ? <p> Picking the right investment is only half the battle . The way you operate  --  and withdraw from  --  your 401(k) counts just as much in crafting a successful retirement . To help you navigate this year 's decisions , here is NEWSWEEK 'S guide to 401(k) management , the markets , mistakes to avoid and new wrinkles to watch for . <p> Power Moves for Your 401(k) : Two strategies are crucial . Yet most 401(k) investors do n't exploit them . The first : know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you retire . Yes , it 's a ridiculously large figure filled with commas . But every other investment decision flows from it : the return you need to earn , how much to save and how much risk you should assume . Call a financial planner , buy some retirement software or use one of the low-cost services offered by banks and brokers to snare your number . Investing your 401(k) without this target is like following a road map with no destination in mind . <p> Second , if your company offers a range of investment options , you should follow a technique from professional investors called asset allocation . Here 's how it works . First decide how much of your retirement pot should go to stocks and how much to bonds . " The most conservative split is 40 percent in bonds and 60 percent in stocks , " says Harold Evensky , a financial planner in Coral Gables , Fla . You can get more conservative or aggressive depending upon how you further divide those portions into mutual funds . The stocks of large U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their return is not as big , either . A 45-to 55-year-old should own a good chunk of such solid biggies . But 25-year-olds , who have plenty of time to wait for the short bursts of high returns associated with risky investments , might devote half of their stock portfolio to small stocks and emerging markets . <p> The next step in allocating your assets is even more important : to rebalance your portfolio annually . This means siphoning off money from the investments that sparkled and putting it into investments that did less well . The goal : start every year with the same percentages of money in each fund . The beauty of asset allocation is that no single investment places first in the investment derby every single year . By spreading your money into different categories , according to your master plan , you 'll capture those stellar returns consistently . <p> What If Your Plan Is a Clunker ? But how you divvy up your money also depends on what kind of options your plan offers . The trend , for example , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're a fund groupie . If not , consider asking a financial planner to help you choose . You could have other difficulties if yours is an " average " plan , which might limit your options to six traditional choices . Whatever you do , do n't assume that dividing your money among all the investment choices is the right way to allocate your savings . <p> The toughest situation : restricted plans like the one here at NEWSWEEK , which offers five fairly conservative stock , bond and money-market funds . You can lobby for an expanded offering , or be practical . Choose the funds that come closest to fitting your blueprint and fill in the gaps with investments outside your 401(k) . If you can afford to , steer your non-401(k) investments toward tax-free securities , such as municipal bonds , or stock funds that aim for capital appreciation . By all means , look at overseas funds , which have n't seen the run-up that domestic stock funds have experienced . <p> How to Watch the Markets : Michael Price , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market would stink this year . Ned Johnson , owner of fund behemoth Fidelity Investments , cautioned fundholders not to expect another year of outsize gains . Standard &; Poor 's forecast a tepid 7 percent return . <p> If folks like these ca n't forecast the market , we 'd be crazy to try . But we can tell you something almost as useful : which markets are way out of whack from where they should be . The accompanying table has two bars . The first shows the yearly return that an investment , such as international stocks , earned on average over the last 26 years . It 's what you might reasonably expect to collect over the next 26 years . The second bar shows you the return each investment produced during the first 10 months of this year . You 're interested in the ones that are far off track from where history says they should be . The theory : eventually those errant investments must return to their " normal " habits . For example , this year only the 500 stocks in S &P's; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing last year , of course . But eventually , the U.S. market 's returns must fall  --  by a lot  --  to produce the historical average of 12.1 percent . Which investments should rise ? International stocks and long-term corporate bonds , which are lagging their historical returns by 9.3 percentage points and 9 percentage points , respectively . <p> Investing by statistics may seem a little too coldblooded . But there 's other evidence that foreign stocks and corporate bonds will look a lot prettier next year . Profits at European companies have been steadily recovering . Now they 're poised to blossom . " I think 1997 will see the best synchronized worldwide expansion since 1988 , " says Michael Metz , an investment strategist at Oppenheimer &; Co . Long-term bond prices are n't likely to shoot up as they did in 1995 . But a half-percentage-point decline in interest rates , forecast by William Gross , a managing director at PIMCO , would produce a 10 percent gain or better for the year . <p> The Biggest 401(k) Blunders : There 's $675 billion socked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted because of a handful of common mistakes . Sidestep them : Do n't load up on company stock . It seems like the loyal thing to do , but putting too much of your retirement money into your employer is a giant mistake . It 's too big a bet on a single stock . And you do n't need the exponential risk . If the company starts sucking wind and lays you off , both you and your 401(k) will be flattened . Amazingly , some 42 percent of 401(k) assets at large companies are vulnerable in this way . Do n't neglect stocks . A shocking number of people use their 401(k) like a bank , stowing their savings in interest-bearing investments rather than stocks . But collecting a fixed rate of return  --  with no chance of appreciation  --  simply wo n't swell your retirement accounts fast enough . The 7 percent offered in many 401(k)s today is only 4 percent after inflation . If you have at least 15 years before retirement even starts , you can weather the stock market 's gyrations . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wad of cash at you . But when employers match a portion of your 401(k) , it really is free money . Think of it as an instant , risk-free return of 50 percent if your company matches 50 cents for every dollar . Take advantage of your firm 's largess . Do n't chase last year 's hot number . Do n't you hate seeing the 401(k) option you did n't pick outgun the one you did ? But switching funds every year can quickly derail your nest egg 's momentum . Outstanding performance in one year is often followed by a lackluster showing . Also , fund-chasing prevents you from following your blueprint  --  so you 're less protected against risk . <p> What if You 're Near Retirement ? Most 401(k) owners are still trying to coax their account toward critical mass . But for those nearing or already in retirement , some quick decisions are in order . Starting in January , a new law will suspend for three years a 15 percent excise tax on annual retirement-account withdrawals above $155,000 . Should you bite ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw a big chunk of money just after the three-year window shuts . The long answer : consult an accountant or financial planner . You have to consider the effect of the excise tax upon two key issues : how the IRS requires you to withdraw your retirement money and how special taxes will affect that nest egg once you die . <p> The rest of us need to start paying attention to the tangle of rules and taxes on withdrawals , too . Why ? A new National Bureau of Economic Research study by John Shoven and David Wise suggests that the wonderful tax-shelter features of 401(k) plans could backfire for millions of prudent investors . Why ? Because large withdrawals are subject to federal and state taxes , as well as the 15 percent excise tax , once it 's reinstated in the year 2000 . The combination could drive your marginal tax rate up to 61.5 percent . Marginal rates on retirement money left to your heirs can climb to a staggering 92 percent . Advice : once your retirement accounts hit a size that will trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off saving money outside of your pension accounts . If you 're already retired and your nest egg is more than $1.2 million , you should consider drawing down all of your retirement funds over your remaining life , even if it means paying the excise tax . Then you can avoid the extraordinary taxes that would be levied on your pension money after you die . <p> Having an overstuffed 401(k) account may seem a distant problem  --  even more distant if the Dow deep-sixes on us . But chin up : that 's OK . For now , your job is to fill out those forms with your personal game plan in mind . Do that , and your account will eventually take care of itself  --  and you .
