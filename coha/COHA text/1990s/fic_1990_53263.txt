Barbarians were churning the farms into mud , polluting our wells . I had to escape . <p> This was 1969 . I was thirteen years old , hiding in the basement . The frayed plastic webbing of my father 's green lounge chair tickled my legs , which were only half-shaped  --  curved here , blockish there . A photo from Life was taped to the window : the earth from the porthole of Apollo 11 . The light from behind made the , earth luminescent and nearly 3-D . It stared down upon me , a cloudy blue eye . <p> The hot-water heater kindled itself in the basement 's black heart . <p> " We have lift-off , " I said . " We have separation , " and I could feel gravity slipping away . <p> Then the heater stopped roaring . <p> " We have engine malfunction " - my voice stony calm- " I repeat , engine failure . " I arose from the lounge chair , swimming my arms . with my ear to the tank , which was warm as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the slosh of a stomach . I rubbed the tank , soothed it . The tank purred . Then : BROOSH . <p> " Thank God , " Houston said . " The experts were stumped . How did you fix it ? " <p> Though I was too old to be playing such games , the lounge chair seemed to beckon as a first love might do . Other girls had crushes on Dylan , Mick Jagger , but these men seemed dangerous . I dreamed of Neil Armstrong in his white padded suit . We 'd be bounding through the vacuum of an unexplored planet when a meteor would sizzle through the sky toward his head . I would push him to safety and be crushed in his place . As he carried me tenderly back to the ship I would smile at him weakly , but the pain would win out and ... <p> " Judith , are you down there ? " <p> My parents were standing at the top of the stairs ; the door to the kitchen was open behind them so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me feel lonely , as a small fish must feel in the shadowy depths . <p> " I 'm thinking , " I said . " Ca n't a person find anywhere in this whole house to think ? " <p> Ordinarily my parents would have flinched at that word . Because I was smart and obviously destined to travel much farther from Bethel than they had , they made the mistake of treating me as though I were older and braver and needed no help understanding the world . But this time my mother wanted to know : Was anything wrong ? Was I feeling .. , unwell ? She whispered to my father , and since they were both timid and small they looked then like children daring each other to venture downstairs . <p> " It is n't that ! " I said , and wished for a blanket to cover my body , which stretched out before me with its landscape of breasts , rib cage , belly , pelvis and knees . <p> All week the paper had been lurid with photos of the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing to music at this " festival " of theirs but an inky strip covered each interesting part , like a gag on a mouth . I scraped at those boxes , even turned the page over to see from the other side what was masked on the front . I felt the reporters had found out my future and printed it here , but blotted the facts I most wanted to know . At the same time I wished every inch of those bodies had been blackened with ink ; the editors were publishing my most shameful secret with only this slight disguise of my features , and the secret was this : that I was n't destined to leap on the moon but to grovel in mud . <p> I took out a book from under my chair . " I 'm reading , " I said . <p> " You 'll ruin your eyes , sweetheart , " my father clucked sadly . " If you 'd only take that paper off the window ... " <p> " That 's not just some ' paper . ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know anything ? " <p> My father retreated , noiseless as the dust motes that chased around his head . My father was a milkman ; he woke up at three and was so schooled in silence that floorboards would n't whimper under his feet , doorjambs would n't click . <p> " We 're leaving the house . " My mother moved down a few steps , as though the stairs were a seesaw and she had to balance her husband 's retreat . " Some of us are going to try to get food to those poor hungry children . " <p> Two days before , when the roads were still open , she 'd made her weekly shopping trip to Monticello ( the only stores in Bethel sold beef jerky , beer and Eskimo pies ) and she 'd found the streets jumbled with barbarians foraging for something to eat . <p> " I even saw people I know selling water . From their hoses ! " she said . " At a dollar a glass ! " <p> It surprised me that anyone would think to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and land , even gas for the car , as the barest supplies that God could hand out so all human beings could make do on Earth , the way that a teacher would supply every student with pencils and paper on the first day of class . But my mother 's condemnation seemed far too harsh . <p> " Do you blame them ? " I asked . " I would n't let those animals drink from our hose . " <p> This clearly disturbed her . My mother was plump , with a plump olive face , and her moods were as easy to read as a child 's . When she was disturbed , everything drooped-her hair , cheeks and . bosom . Even her ankle socks seemed to droop . " I know they look strange .. , but I could n't help but think they might be my own daughter and would n't I want somebody else 's mother to feed her ? " <p> I was sick with the insult . " If they were too stupid to bring enough food you should let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , " my mother admitted , " I saw this young woman .. , she was seven months pregnant .. , she could n't find her husband and he had the money ... " <p> " Do n't tell me you gave this woman our groceries ! " I would have been embarrassed to be so naive , but my mother wore her innocence as proudly as she 'd wear a suit of bright armor ; if she thought well of everyone , this would deflect all ugly intentions and no one would hurt her . <p> " Only the bread , " she told me . " And cheese . She did n't want the chicken , it was too hard to cook . " <p> And so we had eaten our Friday-night supper without any challah , sucking our chicken bones to amplified shrieks . " Give me an F ! Give me a U ! " as though Satan himself were holding a pep rally just down the road . <p> After dessert we turned on the news , and we saw on the screen not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town this night , not a mob of barbarians screaming outside the Pentagon , but outside our house . On the black-and-white set , even the film taken earlier that day was lifeless as ash so it seemed these intruders had stolen the color from the land near our home . Then the newscast went live and the cameras flew over the field near the stage , which looked like a pond writhing with newts in the beam from a flashlight , and the chop of the rotors over our roof was the same chop-chop-chop as from the TV . These were our roofs , our fields , the mob down the road , and my insides went cold with the helplessness of watching yourself in a dream while you drop from a cliff . <p> On Saturday my parents walked to the synagogue , pretending they saw nothing amiss , as Lot and his wife must have tried to look casual as they picked their way through the outskirts of Sodom . And after the service they 'd found out how bad the emergency was . not a few hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the festival had n't prepared for such crowds . All the highways were choked . No food could get through . No one had wanted these young people here , but seeing they were here ... <p> So now , Sunday morning , my father and the other delivery men at Yasgur 's were planning to carry milk to the hordes , while my mother would help the Ladies Hadassah spread tuna on white bread , which nuns from the convent would deliver on foot . <p> " Great , " I said , " fine , go feed the enemy , only leave me alone . " <p> " Well , if you 're sure , " and I heard the stairs sigh , watched the light disappear . <p> I was cruel to my parents and I 've lived to regret this , but then I felt justified , as though I were the parent , yanking the arms of a daughter and son who insisted on watching a worm on the ground while a yellow-haired comet blazed through the sky . Just four weeks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white leaping and landing with infinite grace on the moon  --  on the moon  --  my mother had wandered in from the kitchen , rubbing a glass . " Judith , " she said , " this is historic , " but she had n't stopped rubbing that glass with her cloth , and my father kept saying , " Such brave men these are , " shaking his head in a way that implied " not brave but foolish , " while I felt the Messiah had announced the new kingdom : we were no longer animals whose feet had to stick in the muck of the earth , we could leap on the moon , anything was possible . But how could I argue with people who preferred a lifetime in orbit around this small town  --  delivering milk , shopping and cooking and washing the pots  --  to a flight to the moon ? <p> That night as I lay on my back in our yard , plotting my course by connecting the stars , I whispered : " I 'm coming . " And the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out some books about space travel , asteroids , gravity , light . I did n't understand a word that I read but I felt their mere presence would help me become an astronaut sooner : I could stack these thick books , climb on top , brush the stars . <p> Then a boy I knew , Steven , informed me that astronauts had to be men , in perfect condition , with 20/20 eyesight so their glasses would n't float from their faces or break at critical times . After that I spent hours chinning myself from the beams in the basement until my arms grew as muscular as any boy 's , though I later found out no boy would have felt that fullness and throb as he pulled himself up , thighs pressed , legs crossed . I did twenty push-ups , palms damp on the floor , jumped rope , slap , slap , slap . I , ; pun in a circle so I would not throw up when tested for the job in that bucket in Houston . And I strengthened my sight by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo on the window and straining to read the signs on the farm stand in the Dwyers ' front yard . <p> " Sweet corn , " I said , though I knew I was reading from common sense  --  what else would the Dwyers be advertising at this time of year ? I was squinting to make out the next line of print tomatoes ? peas ? melons ? when an ambulance pulled up and Steven jumped out . He trotted up our drive like an overwound toy . He was always so scrubbed he appeared to be wearing a doctor 's white coat even when dressed in corduroy trousers and a polo shirt for school ; now that he actually was wearing a lab coat ( it hung past his knees ) he was blindingly clean . <p> Of everyone I knew only Steven had dreams as intense as my own , and this must have been the reason I 'd let him lead me one night to the Little League field behind the Jewish cemetery and why I 'd confided what others would have mocked , pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said that astronauts were n't allowed to wear glasses , and he lifted off mine , leaned down . kissed my cheek where it merged with my nose , and told me his dream of mapping each neuron and cell in the brain so he could determine the tangles and gaps that made people ill , as his mother was ill . Using his thumb , he traced the long nerve from my toes to my thigh , and I knew he was using his dream as a reason to touch me this way , but right then the moon seemed very far-off , a circle of ice , and his fingers were warm . <p> " You 're cold , " Steven said . " It 's like you 're not here . " <p> And even as I lay there I thought this was true . I regarded my body as some sort of spaceship that workmen were building and I was n't yet sure I could trust their designs , things might go wrong already I 'd witnessed that leaking of blood so I had n't decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bleachers near Steven , long , narrow , stiff , with an angular chin , eyes pale as slugs with my glasses removed . <p> " Even your hair is cold , " Steven said as his hand fell away . <p> Now he bent to my window , and his face gleamed behind the earth like a bulb . <p> " You 've got to come quick . The kids at the concert are really getting hurt . They 're all on bad trips . Someone called up my father and asked him to come . " <p> Steven 's father was a surgeon , a swaggering man though just five foot two . Dr. Rock ran the hospital as if any question of his authority would be punished by traction , so no one objected when he let his son Steven take blood from patients , give shots and stitch wounds , though Steven had only just turned fifteen . <p> " I 'll be his assistant , " Steven said now , " and you can help me . But you have to hurry up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we still have the hardest half-mile to go . We ca n't leave the ambulance , it 's full of supplies . " <p> " How could you ? " I said . " They 're our enemies , remember ? These people think you can cure a disease by rubbing a certain part of your foot ! They do n't like machines , they do n't like computers . You ca n't reach the moon without a computer ! If they want to louse up their minds with those drugs , why do n't you let them ? " <p> His expression was blank , as though he had never heard this before , and I realized he had n't ; I 'd been the one who 'd done all the talking and he 'd only nodded to humor this girl he wanted to kiss . <p> " It 's a great chance to practice . Maybe I 'll get to help my dad operate . " <p> The ambulance whined . " Sure you wo n't come ? " I shook my head no . <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in some kind of tent . " And he trotted away . <p> With Steven 's departure the cellar seemed twice as dim as before . I lay on the lounge chair and suddenly felt chilled , though the air was so heavy I felt I was lying smothered beneath a big , musty cow . With my book on my chest I daydreamed I 'd left this planet behind-it was charred and defiled , and I was the last civilized being , in a ship so advanced that I would lack nothing , except somewhere to land , someone to greet me when I returned . <p> " Guess no one 's home . " A voice from outside , or maybe a dream . <p> " Hey , trick or treat ! " A reedy voice , singsong . " Give us some food or we 'll give you a trick . " <p> " Shit , man , I 'm hungry . " This voice was deep , its edges were rough . " Ca n't you just smell that food ? Bourgeois fuckin ' pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are eating berries and shit . Let 's liberate the food . Food for the people ! " <p> And I charged up the stairs the way that a sleeper will bolt from her bed swinging her arms to ward off a dream before she wakes up and knows where she is , so I found myself standing with nothing but a book and a flimsy screen door protecting me from three starving barbarians . <p> The smallest was scraggly , with a beard like a goat 's . He was shirtless , in cut-offs and small muddy sneakers . The second was a black man with a square-cut black beard in a dozen thin braids , each laced with gold . The biggest barbarian was shaggy , unkempt , but even in my fear I could sense something sweet and harmless about him , a circus bear fed on popcorn and nuts . He had on a jump suit ; the patch on the chest was embroidered with RUFE . His feet were enormous and hair sprouted from his toe joints . <p> " Jesus , we scared her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to scare you . Jesus , we 'd never ... We were kidding around . Pretending to be these tough guys , you know ? " <p> The black one said , " Shit . We just need a phone . Fitz here , Fitzgibbon " - he pointed to the goat-boy " was on his way home when we shanghaied him here . His poor momma must be shitless by now so we thought he could call . " <p> " And then we smelled food , " the goat-boat said , wistful . " We thought maybe your parents would give us some food . " <p> I kept the door locked , my book poised to strike . Who 'd believe a barbarian cared if his mother knew where he was ? But they did seem upset , as though the Three Stooges had realized their slapstick had really hurt someone . I had n't had time to put on my glasses and this made them blurry , less capable of harm . <p> " Well , then , come on , " the bearish one said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of her gourd ? " His accent was Southern , his tongue thick and slow as a bear 's tongue would be . It struck me as right that a bear should be Southern ..... I suppose that the bears in some Wait Disney movie had spoken like this , arid bears were slow-witted and crude in a way I 'd grown up thinking Southern men were . But I could n't figure out ... Did n't Southern men hate black men ? Did n't they hang them from trees ? <p> The bear swiped his friend 's arm and I almost expected to see bloody claw marks . " Imagine just ca n't you if some big ugly fella with braids in his beard showed up at your door ? You figure your sister should welcome him in ? " <p> " Braids ? Hey , I ... Shit . " He touched his beard . " Shit . There was this girl , and she asked if she could n't put braids in my beard , and I said why not , it would help kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't you ever play games ? Do n't you ever dress up in your momma 's high heels ? " <p> This was too much to tolerate . " I have better things to do . " <p> " Can see that , " the bear said . He narrowed his eyes and recited the title of the book I was holding . " Gravitational Theory . That 's awful heavy reading for someone your age . " <p> " How would you know ? " I asked . <p> " Sure he knows , " chimed the goat-boy . " At Princeton they call him the Astrophys Whiz . " <p> This did n't take me in . None of the astronauts I 'd ever seen would walk around barefoot , though I had seen Neil Armstrong wearing a jump suit ... <p> " Do n't let the hair fool you . " The goat-boy was grinning . " I mean , think of Einstein . Now be was a mess . " <p> " And you two ? " I sneered . " I guess you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the goat-boy . " Do you think we 'd do anything as practical as that ? Leon here " - he pointed- " when Leon grows up he 's going to be a pure mathematician . " <p> " Pure as the snow ! Pure as the rain ! " Leon crossed his white T-shirt . " And Fitz here 's a classicist , " though I had no idea what a classicist was . " Fitz , do your shit , man . Show her how useless a classicist is . " <p> And the goat-boy threw back his long , skinny neck and recited-no , sang-a poem in a language I did n't understand , though I did feel the poetry , like the gallop of horses , and the goat-boy kept singing until I was hypnotized and let down my book . <p> " Sorry to have troubled you . " The bear turned to leave . " We 'll just go next door . " <p> " Oh no , " I said quickly , " the Dwyers have Dobermans and old Mr. Dwyer said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to remember that I had once been in favor of old Mr. Dwyer siccing his dogs on any barbarian who came near his farm . " You can use the phone here . " <p> " You 're sure of that ? " the bear said . " If you 'd rather we did n't ... " <p> Suddenly I felt my bravery in question : he thought I was scared ! <p> " All right , if you 're sure . Fitz can go in , and Leon and me , we 'll stay on the porch . " <p> The goat-boy pawed his sneakers to scrape off the mud . If he meant to slice me open and paint the walls red he would n't be so careful to clean off his shoes . I lifted the latch . <p> " It 's a big house , " he said as we walked through the living room . " I grew up in the city , we just had two rooms . " We got to the kitchen and I watched him dial 0 . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a call , long-distance , collect , to Mrs. Anne Fitzgibbon from her son Timothy . " <p> When his mother got on I could tell she 'd been crazy from fright where he was . <p> " Yes , Morn , I 'm sure , Mom , I really did n't mean to give you such grief but this was my first chance to get to a phone , " and he tried to assure her that he was all fight , getting plenty to eat , so his words made me feel like a kidnapper who had treated him badly and forced him to lie to his mother at gunpoint . <p> He hung up the phone . " What a wonderful smell . " He sniffed with his mouth . ' TI1 bet you had chicken . I smell pickles .. , and potatoes ... I even smell your mother . " <p> " I do n't smell anything . " I was horrified that anyone should say our house smelled ; most of our neighbors wore the odor of their barnyards like ratty old coats they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took pride in how often we bathed , how the kitchen floor shone . <p> The goat-boy said , " A person ca n't smell her own house . You need an outsider . Someone who 's trained . Archeology , see ? When you dig up some ruins you have to be able to sniff out the food the people once ate there , what sort of clothes and perfumes they wore , how they treated their slaves . " <p> I knew he was lying , but believed him enough to feel sad that no one would stand here and sniff and know I had lived . And I nearly believed he could sniff out my future , as he 'd sniffed out the past . I wanted to ask : Would I go to the moon ? Or would the barbarians destroy the world first ? <p> We 'd reached the front door . Leon and the bear stood up and stretched . <p> " I could make you some sandwiches . " <p> " Oh , we do n't want to bother  --  " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I ran to the kitchen . We did n't have much food but I found a few slices of stale pumpernickel ... a jar of peanut butter .. , and honey . A bear would like honey , I thought , so I spread that on too . <p> The barbarians stuffed their mouths with these sandwiches , then they could n't say a word . <p> " W-w-w-w , " moaned Leon , " w-water , " and I thought of the hose , but I ran off and got them glasses of milk . <p> " Ahh , " said the goat-boy . He lifted his glass . " Milk fit for gods . " And I had to laugh because he and Leon had milky white tings encircling their mouths  --  they did n't look like gods but surprised little boys . The two seemed offended , but they glanced at each other and swiped at their mouths with the backs of their hands . <p> " I do n't suppose you 'd know a place we could wash at ? " The bearish one stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his crotch . " Some swimming hole nearby ? " <p> " Yeah , " Leon said , " I sure as shit could go for a swim . " <p> " There 's a pond , " I said , happy to have the right answer , though sorry to think they would soon leave my porch . <p> Leon wrinkled his nose . " Not some little cow pond covered with green shit and pissed in by a half-million hippies like the cow pond back there ? " <p> " No , this one 's big , and the water 's really clean . " ! flushed with the arrogance of access to places that strangers could n't find . Then I realized these strangers would n't be able to find the pond without me . " I could show you , " ! said , then wished that ! had n't . <p> " That would be awful nice , " the bear said , and smiled . " Then you and I can talk about gravity . That is , if you want . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to the cellar to put on my glasses , so when I came back I saw all three clearly , their pimples and dirt , the pores where the beard hairs poked through their skin , and this made them seem less frightening , and more . <p> " Follow me , " I said . And I led our parade down a trail through the woods it seemed the cool air had fled the other barbarians and was trembling here beneath this camouflage of leaves . The trail passed a tractor whose tires had been used for archery practice . I felt someone draw the metallic tip of one of those arrows down my neck , down my spine , but I turned and saw no one except for the goat-boy , who was sniffing the air and skipping a little , and the other two behind him . <p> When we got to the pond I heard Leon whistle . <p> " Shit , look at that . In Newark , man .. , shit . " <p> I did n't understand . This was only the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a boy from a city might see it , and if I 'd accused the barbarians of stealing the color from Bethel , they gave it back doubly , once right-side up and again upside down . Every orange salamander and blue darning needle signaled me like some code from beyond . <p> The goat-boy and Leon stripped to their undershorts , then dove in long arcs , came up again and started to race , one heavy black arm and one scrawny pale arm rising and falling , the gold-threaded braids of Leon 's beard floating out from his chin like some intricate lure . <p> " Hmm , I 'm afraid ... " The bearish one was fiddling with the zipper on his jump suit . <p> " Afraid of the water ? " I asked . <p> " No , afraid I do n't have any underwear . " <p> " I wo n't look , " I promised , though I found when he started to pull down his zipper I could n't turn away . As he stepped from the jump suit I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , what I saw was my first naked man , layered in fur so he seemed like an animal , a burly brown bear , and poking from the pouch that hung between his legs was a separate little animal a baby , a pet , like a baby kangaroo peeking out shyly and waving its ann . And what I felt then was n't love at first sight , but my first sight of love , of what it could mean to love someone else , a stranger , not family , and how risky this was , loving a pitifully weak , naked man . <p> He clumsily paddled out a few yards , furry bum in the air . " Do n't you want to come in ? Water 's just right . " <p> I shook my head no . " I do n't have a suit , " though this was ridiculous-neither did he . And the way that he looked at my body just then made me want to disclaim it : " That body 's not mine , I have n't moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't feel at home yet , its comers still dark , its workings mysterious . <p> He was standing in the shallows up to his waist , slapping the water as a bear tries to slap a fish onto shore . This made the reflections of the trees and sky shimmer , then shatter to fragments of green , blue and white , which were fragmented further by the drops on my glasses . <p> The goat-boy and Leon dragged themselves , dripping , onto the rocks to warm in the sun . " Man , do n't those lizards have the fight idea ? " And they both fell asleep . <p> Grumbling because the stones cut his feet , the bear hobbled through the shallows . He sprawled by my side , draping his jump suit over his thighs . <p> " I 'm lying here naked and you do n't know my name . " lie held out a paw . " Meyer Rabinowitz . Pleased to meet you . " <p> " Not Rufe ? <p> " Rufe ? Oh yeah , this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Atlanta , Georgia , a fella named Rufe is pumping gas naked . " <p> " You 're Jewish . And Southern . " None of our relatives lived farther south than Paramus , New Jersey . <p> " If your mind ca n't stretch over those two categories , you 'll never be a physicist . You 've got to be able to imagine a thing " - the word came out thing  --  " being two things at once . " <p> " A physicist ? Who said I 'd want to be that ? Is that what you are ? I thought they said you were some kind of astronaut . " <p> " That 's all fight , " he said . " Even my mother ca n't keep it straight . The difference is this : an astronaut goes up there , flying in space , but an astrophysicist only thinks about going , what the trip would be like . " <p> " You never leave Earth ? " <p> " A fat guy like me ? Besides , I got asthma . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really believed this was a man who could pass NASA 's test . " It does n't make sense . I do n't understand how you think about space . What do you think about ? " <p> " For now I just think about whatever my professors tell me to think about . But later ... I mean , when I 'm out on my own ... " He leaned forward , excited , and his jump suit slipped a little , exposing his navel ; its pattern resembled the continents and oceans dividing the earth . " What I 'd really like to think about is what it 's like living in higher dimensions . " <p> I 'd been fooled after all . " You 're not talking science . You 're talking the way the barbarians talk . " <p> " Barbarians ? " <p> I waved my hand toward the dairy . <p> He wagged his head , laughing . " That what you call them ? How come barbarians ' ? " <p> " We learned it in school . The barbarians came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody read . They kept alive science while the vandals outside their caves pillaged and sacked . " <p> " That what you think ? You 're really afraid of those hippies out there ? You 're an awful strange kid . " <p> I should have felt strange then . I 'd felt strange all my life . I 'd had the premonition I would never have allies , except false ones like Steven . But now I could see I was part of a team , and though our team , the monks , might be greatly outnumbered , I would n't have to fight the barbarians alone . <p> " Guess I 'd better tell you about higher dimensions , in case it 's all up to you . " He slid down the rock ; his toe stirred the pond . " It 's this way , " he said . " Suppose you had left a note for your parents : ' I went for a swim , and if you come looking here 's where I 'll be . ' " <p> The example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been foolish not to leave such a note ? <p> " Well , you 'd need three dimensions to say where you were , three dimensions in space . And you 'd have to let them know when you would be here or they 'd miss you entirely . You and your parents would pass through each other in space-time , now would n't you ? " <p> I guessed that we would and this made me feel sad , like Dorothy in Oz when she 'd seen Auntie Em in the witch 's glass ball and called out her name , " Auntie Em , Auntie Em , " but had n't been able to make her aunt hear . <p> " It 's like this , " he said , using a stone to draw on the rock the way little girls draw boards for hopscotch . When he finished I saw two ice cream cones with their pointy ends touching . <p> " See this point here ? " Meyer placed his finger where the ice cream cones met . " That 's us , here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger on the right-side-up cone- " that 's our future , okay ? All the places and times we 'd be able to reach moving at any speed slower than light . Because no one can ever go faster than light . You must have read that . " <p> Although I had read this , the equations that proved it were a dense drape of lace I could not peer through to the reasons beyond , and so , in my ignorance , I was free to believe that once I got up there I 'd show they were wrong , my rocket would tear that paper-thin curtain , that barrier of light . <p> I nodded . " I read it . " <p> " But you think maybe somehow you 'll find a way to go faster than light ? " <p> I shrugged . I did n't want him to think I was boasting . <p> He snorted . " Okay . Everyone thinks that . But you 'll find out you 're wrong . This is the only future you 'll have . And this cone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of this other stuff , outside the cones , all this is elsewhere . " <p> " Elsewhere ? " I said . <p> " Sure , " Meyer said . " Out here is elsewhere , the places you and I ca n't ever reach , ca n't ever have been , because even if we traveled fast as a light beam all our born days , that 's far as we 'd get . " <p> I still felt defiant . " How do they know ? " <p> " Because there are limits . Who knows , maybe angels can live out in elsewhere , but people can only live in the past , or the future , or now . " He seemed to be thinking aloud for my benefit and this eased the frustration of having to travel slower than light . " Animals , I suppose , can just live in now , we 're ahead of them there . People at least can imagine what it 's like to live out in elsewhere . At least we have that . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere was like , but a cough tore the stillness . The goat-boy and Leon had awakened , I saw , and were passing a cigarette back and forth , back and forth . I was stunned by this intimacy . Then something the smell , like some bittersweet flower , or the curve of their cheeks as they sucked at the smoke shocked me the way that seeing a movie star in person can shock . <p> " But they 're smart guys ! " I said . " Leon knows math . " <p> He shrugged his big shoulders . " Smart guys do dumb things . Leon thinks it helps him visualize things like imaginary numbers . And Fitz , well , he likes it , he ca n't seem to stop . " <p> I suddenly glimpsed the future and it had no Fitz in it . His mother was weeping , haunting this rock and weeping for a son who had killed himself smoking too much marijuana . <p> " Why are you here ? " I asked Meyer brusquely . <p> " You mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " No , I mean all of you . Why did you come ? " <p> " Me ? I do n't know . The music , I suppose . I needed a rest before the next term . I like the outdoors . And I figure it 's good to pack in as many things as you can before you 're too old . Some of them , like Fitz , they came for the ride . And a few of them were hoping to find something ... big . I guess they found that . Something big , something pure . You know what you see when you look at the moon ? You think it 's all right to spend your whole life trying to get there , it 's so big and pure ? That 's how they feel . They do n't even see the mud that they 're sitting in . They found something pure . " <p> " Does that mean they 'll stay ? " <p> He laughed . " I do n't think so . No matter how stoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stink and the hunger for more than a while . Not if you 're human . You ca n't live in elsewhere , you ca n't live in space , you ca n't live in squalor much more than a week . " <p> My relief did n't last long ; he asked me politely if I 'd please turn my head , and when I looked back he was standing and dressed . <p> " Hey , do n't y'all think we should go ? " he shouted to the others . " Do n't want to miss Hendrix . That 's why I came . " Then he turned back to me . " You 've been very kind . " He held out his hands and lifted me up . " Do n't look so glum . World 's not so big . We could meet again . " <p> I wanted to set a place and a time , all four dimensions , so I 'd know he 'd be waiting and the years would n't feel long . Before I could say this , Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand and all three had left . <p> I must have found my way back to the house , lain brooding on my lounge chair , but no events marked the passage of time so those hours are lost . I only remember when my parents returned . I heard noise in the kitchen and went up to join them . <p> " I 've a mind to press charges ! " My father was rifling the drawer by the sink . " The cowards ! " he said . He took out the Band-Aids and slammed the drawer shut . This noise from my father was as shocking as speech from a mute would have been . He handed the box of Band-Aids to my mother , who was slumped on a stool , and that 's when I noticed her checked blouse was ripped . A safety pin held the pieces together but a slice of bright pink brassiere still winked through . <p> " How did you do that ? " <p> " There 's no need to tell her , " he cautioned my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was someone I know ? " Why would anyone I know rip my mother 's checked blouse ? <p> She applied a small Band-Aid to a scratch on her wrist . " Oh it 's nothing , " she said , though she 'd never drooped so badly  --  her anklets had vanished into her shoes . " We ran into old Mr. Dwyer in town , and he and a few of the neighbors are furious that we 'd try to help  --  " <p> My father was furious . " If they do n't want to buy Max 's milk anymore , that 's their prerogative . But ripping a blouse ! Scratching a woman who tries to do good ! " <p> Since my father spent his days delivering milk and was so smooth and pale , I 'd always half-thought his essence was milk , which I guess meant untroubled , innocent , clean , but his face was so streaked and his features so clouded I could n't help but think of the milk behind the dairy that was left to be dumped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding her hands to her blouse , hanging her head . " It was partly my fault . When I pushed him away my arm caught his buckle . " <p> I tried to imagine my mother wrestling with old Mr. Dwyer he was only an inch or two taller than she was , and quite a bit plumper . <p> " And blaming the Jews ! To say Max is a kike who rented his land to Communists because he ca n't resist money ! " He had always assumed that since he was privileged to open the boxes on his neighbors ' back stoops and decipher the notes they 'd left him inside ( " Judd has an ulcer ... " " Ca n't pay this week ... " " Miscarriage ... " " Transfer ... " ) , because they allowed him to see them in curlers and torn robes or long johns he knew who they were . <p> " If that farmer wants a lesson in manners , " he said , " he should look at those kids . Who would expect they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few quarts of milk . " He pulled a feather from his pocket ; in a crate by the door were a string of purple beads , a collection of hats of all sorts and shapes , a broken guitar , a bouquet of weeds in a ponytail wrapper , a freshly whittled flute and a cookbook whose recipes were blessed by a man whose mustache and nose made him resemble my grandfather Morris . " So maybe they do n't act like people like us . The young men do n't : mind if their girlfriends show off their bodies in public not to say the girls have bodies to shame them . Such big , healthy girls ! " And his face made me think he was seeing them now , those big , naked girls . <p> " And the little ones . " My mother refastened the pin so it hid the pink bra . ( Why had she bought it ? Her others were white . ) " In town they were saying the diseases were dreadful they could n't get the pumps in to drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If a fire breaks out ... " <p> " I guess I should open a can of soup for dinner . " My mother did n't move . " But I 'd feel guilty eating with those poor hungry children .. , and sleeping tonight on a bed with clean sheets ... " <p> That was it ! I 'd invite them to sleep in our house , in cots in my room . <p> I left my parents sitting on the floor in the kitchen , sifting through the relics they 'd acquired that day , and I almost wish I had n't  --  my father was never so silent again , my mother drooped much more often , it seemed . And though their confrontation with old Mr. Dwyer only began a chain of events that made them feel less and less part of the town , I blame this beginning for their decision many years later to do what they 'd said they never would do : they moved away from Bethel when my father retired . And then they kept moving , trying new places-they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year  --  as if once they 'd been knocked from their tiny fixed orbits , they wobbled , unrestrained , all over the country : first Florida , then Phoenix , then Houston near me ( I was glad when they left , afraid they 'd find out I was n't as smart as they 'd once thought , was n't destined for greatness ; the machines made my job seem more impressive than it actually was ) . They still tried to see only the best in the people they met , even if this meant they had to move on before seeing the worst . And whenever I got a postcard from someplace like L.A. or Reno , I feared for their innocence as once I had scorned it , and I was impatient with their wanderings as I had once been impatient with their unchanging lives . Because even though I did n't want to go home to Bethel , I felt they should be there in case that I did ; I felt I 'd gone swimming and they 'd stolen the shore . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , but now , as I walked , two thin black clouds swirled through the sky like a helicopter 's rotors slicing the sun . In the shadows of a corn field I made out two men , one holding his fly , the patter of his urine spraying the stalks , the other man squatting with his pants to his knees . When the wind came I thought it was bringing their smell , but as I walked on , the air thickened with the odor of three-day-old garbage and I had to pull the neck of my jersey over my nose to inhale the fresh breeze captured in the fabric days before on the line . How could they stand it ? But then I remembered what the goat-boy had said about people not being able to smell their own smell , and what Meyer had told me about people who wanted so badly to think they 'd found something pure that they would n't smell its smell , at least for a while . <p> The sky was gray-black and the winds had picked up so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human howls and grunts from the woods , saw flames here and there , and I almost turned back the trucks would n't get through and we all would be burned . But then I saw faces bobbing over the flames like yellow balloons and I realized these people were cooking their dinners , what little they had , though how could they eat with so many flies ? These rose from the mud with each step I took , settled on my eyelids , trapped themselves in my ears . I could hear trees and wires snapping like whips , and the throb of the music I could n't hear the words and thunder , in the distance , and the helicopters grinding over our heads . <p> And though I brag now about having grown up there , having been in that crowd when I was thirteen , the truth is I only remember my terror , my wish to escape . I wandered those fields I 'd known all my life , picking my way among feet , heads and limbs . I stepped over bodies face-down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never find Meyer or the goat-boy or Leon . <p> I saw a big tent . I went in and stood . A woman in a uniform came up and said : " Honey , are you in there ? What did you take ? " snapping her fingers in front of my eyes . <p> " No time for that , just get her a blanket . " Dr. Rock , rushing by , glanced at my face without recognition . " These fucking asshole parents ought to be shot , exposing a kid to something like this . " <p> The nurse took my arm but I shook her off . I saw Steven kneeling by a female barbarian , swabbing a cut . He was still shining white but the whiteness was stained , which unsettled me as much as seeing a statue spattered with blood . His eyes were n't focused , so it took him a while to see that I 'd come . <p> " You 're too late , " he said . " This woman had a baby .. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some butcher must have done a bad job but I 'm not really sure .... And this kid , he was sleeping , and some jerk on a tractor thought the sleeping bag was empty .... And this one diabetic who did n't bring her insulin , she went into shock . What jerks ! I mean , coming to someplace like this and you do n't bring your medicine ? And these guys on bad trips , one had this knife and he came at my father  --  " <p> " Goddamn it , Steven , get your ass over here ! " <p> Steven obeyed , leaving me at the edge of the tent . The wind ripped fight through , blowing gauze pads from carts , rattling bottles . The canvas roof billowed and the center pole shook so I went back outside , out in the rain , which tore at my skin . A dozen barbarians were stomping and sliding and splashing one another but everyone else was huddled together close to the ground , holding garbage bags , sleeping bags , parkas and blankets over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself shook . <p> " Hey , come on in . " <p> Slowly I knelt and took shelter under a huge plastic tarp . It was humid and dark , body to body . Someone put an arm over my shoulder and we started to sway ; people were chanting " no rain , no rain " as though this were a spell to make the rain stop . We were so many people so close together I had the sensation of losing my boundaries  --  the wind had stripped off the walls of the house that I had moved into only that day , and I had trouble telling where my own body ended and the others began . <p> This scared me so much I said half-aloud : " I 'm not far from home . I 've been here before . " And I pictured the field the way I had seen it thousands of times , the green and gold pasture with its intricate shading and texture of weeds , clover , alfalfa , a great green bowl rising to a rim where it met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's glass cabinet , and the land beyond that , with its swells and depressions , so a tractor would sink and disappear a moment , then float back to view . <p> I tried to imagine the scent of fresh hay warmed by the sun , but the stench of the present brought me back to this place . I was stuck in this time and would never get out . We would die in this place , buried in mud , so that years in the future , archaeologists would stand here and see only dirt , though they might sniff our presence under the earth and know we had lived , know we had once been huddled together under this tarp chanting " no rain , no rain " as if we believed that we could get elsewhere simply by wishing as hard as we could . <p> <p> By Eileen Pollack <p>
