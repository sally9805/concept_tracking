<p> To understand Newt Gingrich , one must enter the realm of his motivational audiotapes , which are mailed every year to thousands of aspiring Republican politicians in need of inspiration . As candidates drive thanklessly from one campaign event to the next , wondering if it 's all worth it , Gingrich 's voice booms through their car audio systems , telling them how to persevere in the face of defeat and frustration . <p> The first thing they must understand is : Life is hard . <p> " That is a major , major mistake we 've made since World War II , to suggest that life is easy and the difficulties are the aberration , " Gingrich says in a tape entitled " History and Leadership , " recorded last April . " I think the opposite is true . I think life is normally hard , and it 's the good moments that are the aberration . And that you work hard and you try to raise a family and you try to earn a living and you try to have a safe neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society starts out saying : Life is hard . " <p> Gingrich , the history teacher , goes on to recount the heroism of famous generals who soldiered on when their troops were routed and savaged in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War . He tells of George Washington crossing the Delaware after fleeing across New York and New Jersey , and suffering the brutality of winter at Valley Forge . He tells of Ulysses S. Grant , after the bloodbath of Shiloh , when it seemed only prudent to retreat , " smoking a slightly soggy cigar " and resolving to march onward . " Lick ' em in the morning , " the general said . <p> He just as easily could have told of Gingrich on the morning after Election Day 1976 , having suffered his second hair's-breadth defeat in the Battle of the 6th Congressional District , resolving to run a third time for Congress even as his ragtag campaign staff sat mired in the Slough of Despond . <p> As he mounted his third campaign , and later plotted a conservative overthrow of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust cleared , he would be the one left standing , but certain , too , that he would have to spill his own and others ' blood along the way . As he said on the tape , " Some days we 're going to do well . Some days we 're going to do badly . In Thomas Paine 's language , this is not a game for summer soldiers . " <p> Achieving a Dream In marching on toward 1978 , Gingrich would finally achieve , at age 35 , the dream he conceived 20 years before of becoming a Republican congressman . In the process , he displayed sometimes icy resolve , shedding two defining features of his past . He divorced his wife , Jackie , after 19 years of marriage , turning many hometown supporters against him . And after courting Democrats in his early races , largely out of political necessity , he arrived in Washington and declared his intent to destroy Democratic control in the Capitol . <p> Some earlier supporters came to see him as a power-crazed egomaniac , who ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight that he turned himself into a caricature to attract it . But many Republican strategists in Washington detected a brilliant method in what others deemed madness and welcomed Gingrich as a revolutionary politician who could lead the party to power . <p> The reaction of Lucy Klee , a Democrat and former teaching colleague of Gingrich 's who , along with her husband , gave Gingrich his first political contribution in 1973 , shows how unprepared some early supporters were for the Gingrich who ultimately emerged : <p> " We were taken in , " she said in an interview . " We had no warning what he 'd be like . We were more than disappointed . We were aghast . I told Newt that I 'd never vote for another Republican and he was n't at all upset . He said that was okay as long as I was consistent . " <p> Failed Literary Venture <p> After the 1976 loss , Gingrich and his wife were broke from his back-to-back defeats . He had little chance of getting tenured at West Georgia College in Carrollton , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time politicking instead of publishing . Running again in 1978 , without the cushion of a tenured position , would mean living with no income for the second half of the year . <p> Brightening the picture , about a dozen wealthy financial supporters of Gingrich 's previous campaigns kicked in $ 13,000 to pay Gingrich to write a novel over the summer of 1977 . This was well over half his annual salary as an assistant professor . The deal , organized by local developer Calvin Rausch , was structured as a tax shelter with the ironic result that the government paid subsidies in the form of tax breaks to wealthy backers of a standard-bearer for smaller government . Gingrich used the same technique to bankroll a later book deal . <p> Gingrich took his family to Europe with the money from the 1977 deal , and researched a novel that was to be about World War III . A decade later , Gingrich told the Clayton ( Ga . ) Sun that he wrote the first three chapters and sent them to futurist Alvin Toffler , with whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are obviously better at shaking hands than writing fiction . " <p> Gingrich told the Sun in 1988 that he never finished the book . However , a manuscript of a book was found in Gingrich 's personal archive at West Georgia College after a Democratic challenger made an issue of it , a decade after Gingrich was paid for it . Albert S. Hanser , a West Georgia historian whom Gingrich calls his long-term thinker , now says Gingrich completed the book in 1978 . " The book is not bad , it 's just not good , " he said . <p> Gingrich was well-known in Washington before his 1978 race . He was discovered , ironically , by Bob Beckel , a Democrat who identified him in 1974 as a " reform " candidate for the then-bipartisan National Committee for an Effective Congress . <p> Beckel , who later managed the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter F. Mondale , said he visited Gingrich 's Democratic opponent , Rep. John J. Flynt , a 20-year incumbent and old-school southern segregationist , and was " appalled " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got to be better than this guy . " He went to Gingrich 's house and they spent several hours talking about politics and campaigns . <p> " He was quite naive about it , " said Beckel , but " he asked unbelievably detailed questions and good questions , too . " Beckel said he passed Gingrich on to Russ Evans , a Republican strategist , and had no more contact with him . " I do n't do Republicans , " Beckel explained . <p> Noticed in Washington That year , Washington Post political writer David S. Broder highlighted Gingrich as one of a number of young , promising Republicans taking on Democratic incumbents around the country . He called him a " moderate conservative . " Evans introduced Gingrich to Wilma Goldstein , then director of survey research at the Republican National Committee . " I became one of Newt 's champions in Washington , " she said . <p> Next he met Eddie Mahe , political director of the RNC in 1974 . " He came wandering up to Washington seeking support , " Mahe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Why is this guy in my office ? Who let him in here ? ' It took me three and a half minutes to find out he was smarter than I was and I should listen to him . He had great certainty about what he was going to do and how he was going to get it done . " <p> Gingrich 's 1978 campaign was dramatically different from his losing efforts against Flynt in 1974 and 1976 . The earlier races were run by political amateurs , with help from many volunteers from the environmental movement and college campuses . Defeating Flynt was a cause among many Democrats as well as Republicans . <p> But in 1978 , Flynt retired rather than run again . The National Republican Congressional Committee pegged Gingrich a sure winner , and along with other GOP organizations , contributed about $ 50,000 of the $ 219,000 he raised . The campaign committee also helped field for Gingrich his first professional campaign manager , Carlyle Gregory , and a consultant , Bob Weed , both fresh from the 1976 victory of Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media consultant , Dino Seder . <p> The environmentalists and college crowd disappeared from the campaign headquarters , which was moved from Democratic Carrollton , home of West Georgia College , to the other end of the district , the Republican suburbs of Atlanta . The 1978 Gingrich volunteers were mostly card-carrying Republicans . <p> The content of Gingrich 's message also changed dramatically . The Democrats nominated state Sen. Virginia Shapard , a moderate liberal who , like Gingrich , advocated good-government reforms . Nationally , the anti-tax movement was burgeoning , and Gingrich embraced the congressional Kemp-Roth tax-cutting plan , a precursor to Ronald Reagan 's fiscal policies . <p> His television ads were some of the most aggressively negative the Atlanta area had seen . <p> " We found bills in the Georgia Senate with great titles like ' A Bill to Reduce Your Taxes , ' " said L.H. Carter , the campaign treasurer , who now denounces Gingrich . " It was a terrible bill . It failed like 49 to 1 , and of course Virginia voted against it . We had a voice-over saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes ... . She knows how she voted . She only hopes you do n't . ' She was a touch on the heavy side and we had a chunky woman 's arm with an iron bracelet come down and stamp a big red ' no ' in the middle of the bill , " Carter said . <p> " Those ads stopped her campaign , " said Gregory , because they defined Shapard as an advocate of liberal , big government and Gingrich as the opposite . The campaign also attacked Shapard 's family wealth  --  her primary victory party was held at her family mansion . Gregory said Jackie Gingrich wrote letters to women across the district saying , " Newt and I have to live on a budget just like you do . We have to work hard . We need someone who understands that inflation hurts everybody . " <p> " I 've read some articles about what a nasty , mean , terrible campaign it was . At the time , we thought we were being tough , but we did n't think we were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an interview last week . Shapard did not return repeated phone calls . <p> A pro-Gingrich advertising campaign in rural newspapers was nastier . Gregory said he did not sanction it , and Gingrich said he has no memory of it . Carter said those ads showed Newt and his family on the right and Virginia on the left without her family . They said , ' Newt will take his family to Washington and keep them together ; Virginia will go to Washington and leave her husband and children in the care of a nanny . Newt is deacon of the First Baptist Church of Carrollton ; Virginia is a communicant of the Church of the Good Shepard in Griffin . " <p> " We went after every rural southern prejudice we could think of , " another campaign official , who asked to remain anonymous , said of the newspaper ads . " We were appealing to the prejudice against working women , against their not being home . And ' communicant ' sounded like a bunch of Catholics to Georgians . " <p> A Gingrich campaign flier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , describing her as a former " welfare worker . " The flier read : " If you like welfare cheaters , you 'll love Virginia Shapard , " saying she and Bond helped beat a GOP-backed " anti-welfare cheater " bill in the state Senate . <p> Gingrich said last week that none of his three House races in the 1970s was ideological and that in each campaign , he was defining himself against his opponent . Because Flynt was a conservative segregationist , he appeared liberal by comparison ; because Shapard was the equivalent of " a liberal Democrat from New York pretending to be conservative , " he said , he looked conservative without moving to the right . <p> The Atlanta Constitution , after endorsing Gingrich in his first two races , endorsed Shapard in 1978 , saying Gingrich 's campaign had " gone beyond vigor and into demagoguery and plain lying . " In supporting him before , the paper said , " we believed he would bring a needed freshness and imagination to the job . His imagination , however , seems to be running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gingrich beat Shapard by almost 50,000 votes . At his victory party , Gregory was struck by Gingrich 's restrained demeanor . " I was deliriously happy , " Gregory said , " but Newt never whooped . He went around the room shaking hands . He did not exult . He went straight into the incumbent mode , the work mode : I 've got to shake hands . I 've got to get ready to make an acceptance speech . " <p> Majority Becomes the Goal <p> Gingrich was not celebrating because he had an enormous task ahead of him . Right after his election , he came to Washington , met with the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman , Rep. Guy Vander Jagt ( Mich. ) , and advised him the party needed a plan to become the majority in America . At the time , the GOP leadership advanced its agenda largely by making deals with the Democratic majority  --  going along to get along . <p> Vander Jagt , who had followed Gingrich 's progress for the previous five years , talked with him for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan for a Republican majority . " I skipped him over about 155 sitting Republicans to do it , and from that moment on he has been planning for a Republican majority , " Vander Jagt said . <p> Toward this end , in his first year in the House , Gingrich led a Republican attack to expel then-Rep . Charles C. Diggs ( D-Mich. ) , who was convicted of a felony for diverting $ 6,000 from his congressional payroll to personal use and who later resigned to serve a prison term . In his second year , he organized a forerunner of the 1994 " Contract With America " event , bringing House and Senate candidates to Washington to appear on the Capitol steps with the party 's presidential candidate , Ronald Reagan , in a telegenic appeal to voters to elect a Republican majority . <p> The two actions highlighted the twin themes Gingrich pursued throughout his campaign to build Republican strength  --  undermining Democratic credibility by defining the party as corrupt and scripting televised events to draw attention from across the country to a positive image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , Gingrich told the Atlanta Journal that he had no interest in carving out a role for himself on a subcommittee  --  the traditional first rung on the House ladder  --  and instead planned to spend his time harassing Democrats and challenging senior House Republicans over their idea of leadership . <p> " It 's a little like playing three-dimensional chess , " Gingrich told the Journal . " We 're engaged in three or four revolutions at once . " <p> Gingrich appointed himself the Republican Party 's idea man . Nancy Sinnott Dwight , an executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee in Gingrich 's first years in Congress , said he was always stalking the committee 's corridors with books and sheaves of paper under his arms  --  reading , making lists , writing memos . <p> " The main thing I had to do as his administrative assistant is say , ' You 're right about that too , Newt , but we ca n't do that now , ' " said campaign consultant Bob Weed , who ran Gingrich 's first congressional staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the power of that is just awesome over time . It wore me out just to be around the guy . " Weed said he quit after two years . <p> At the NRCC one day early in Gingrich 's career , the staff , as a joke , changed the filing cabinet labels to read : " Newt Ideas " ; " Newt Ideas " ; " Newt Ideas . " And the last drawer : " Newt Good Ideas . " <p> Family Values Image Although Gingrich advertised himself in the race against Shapard as the family values candidate , he was having extramarital affairs at the time , according to four campaign aides . Around Carrollton , he was still seen walking hand in hand with Jackie , who made enormous sacrifices to support his political career and was beloved in the town , according to friends . But according to Gingrich , the marriage was fraying badly then . <p> He was only 19 when he married Jackie Battley , his high school geometry teacher who was seven years his senior , and by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We had been through counseling in the 1970s . It did n't work , " Gingrich said last week . " It was a tragedy . I wish it had not happened . I mean you go through life and sometimes things happen ... . In a different world maybe it would have worked differently . And I never speak ill of my ex-wife . She raised two wonderful daughters . " <p> As for the affairs , Gingrich said only : " In the 1970s , things happened  --  period . That 's the most I 'll ever say . " Gingrich filed for divorce in 1980 and married Marianne Ginther , eight years his junior , in 1981 , months after his divorce was final . <p> Gingrich dismissed suggestions that his personal behavior compromised his crusade for stricter moral values in America . <p> " I start with an assumption that all human beings sin and that all human beings are in fact human , " he said . " I assume that all reporters fit the same category . And I think one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model that says you 're either a total saint or you ca n't speak , which is crazy . So all I 'll say is that I 've led a human life . " <p> The divorce proceedings began near the end of Gingrich 's first term . His wife earlier found she had cancer . She was successfully treated but suffered a recurrence during the divorce . Jackie Gingrich filed court papers during their separation saying Newt was providing only $ 700 a month for her and the girls , then ages 17 and 14 . The papers said she could not pay the basic household bills and was facing imminent cut-off of the utilities . Church members took up a collection to help out . Newt Gingrich filed papers in response , including an accounting of his monthly expenses , which showed that he was spending $ 400 on food and dry-cleaning for himself . <p> Financial statements filed in the divorce showed that Gingrich had virtually no savings . Even today , his disclosure form lists no investment worth more than $ 15,000 . <p> The most startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the proceedings , when Jackie Gingrich was recovering from surgery , and Newt Gingrich came to visit her in the Carrollton hospital . He pulled out a legal pad and began to discuss details of the divorce , according to accounts Jackie Gingrich confirmed in published interviews . She has said she threw him out of the room . Jackie Gingrich did not return numerous calls or written requests for an interview . Gingrich said in 1989 : " It did not happen that way from my side . " <p> Said former congressman Vin Weber ( R-Minn . ) : " Do I believe it happened ? Yeah , okay , I believe it . But boy it 's not an accurate portrayal of Newt to simply portray him as a ruthless man . There is certainly that side , but also a deeply human , very sensitive side . Almost a little vulnerability there . A definite desire to have real friends , which I think he 's not had a lot of in his life . People who understand that side of Newt can do quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onetime friend turned detractor , said the congressman was blunt about why he wanted a divorce , telling him : " She 's not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of the president . And besides , she has cancer . " Gingrich has vehemently denied saying this . <p> Carter , making his case against Gingrich , says he has a history of dropping people when they are no longer useful to him . Gingrich responded : " This Carter is a guy I deliberately fired because we got into an argument about whether or not he had to tell me what he was doing . If you could cross-reference every person quoted in every one of these articles about his divorce , they 're almost always the same three people ... . So here 's this image that on the one hand , Gingrich really sheds people , except by the way , there are people now who have worked with him for a quarter century . Now which is true ? " ( Carter said he resigned , rather than be fired . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national goals , his district administrator in Georgia , Dolores Adamson , said his temperament changed . For the first two terms , she said , " If we said that he really needed to do something , even if it made the schedule tight , he 'd say : ' That 's fine , I trust you , you 're in charge . ' " <p> But after winning his third race , Adamson said , Gingrich became more arrogant and authoritarian , insisting that she and the staff tape every speech he made for a personal archive he was establishing at West Georgia College . Adamson said she suggested to Gingrich that constituents might consider him " cocky " if they realized he was taping all of his speeches for history . " He said he 'd deduct our salary $ 200 a week if we did n't do it , " she said . <p> She said Gingrich also required the staff to read books central to his political ideas , such as Toffler 's " The Third Wave , " about society 's changes from the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufacturing , to the " third wave " or information age . <p> " When he got excited about a book , the staff had to read it , " Adamson said . " When we 'd go to meetings , when we wrote letters , we 'd have to use that idea : hunting and gathering , for example . Just like he 's teaching candidates how to talk now with his tapes , we 'd have to use those phrases in letters and talking to people . He wanted the whole organization to say the same things , all the things he wanted to get across . <p> " I felt like it was all a bit much , " she said . " We grew wider and wider apart . When I quit in 1983 , the only thing he asked me was whether I was going to run against him . " <p> Gingrich by then had completed a series of evolutions . Just as the liberal Rockefeller Republican of 1968 had become the Nixon Republican of 1972 , the congressman who told Atlanta reporters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate " was poised to become a thundering national voice of conservatism . <p> True to Original Issues <p> However , Gingrich remained true to two of his original issues hardly associated with conservatism  --  the environment and civil rights . His commitment waxed and waned over the years , but in his first term , he voted for the Alaska Lands Act , the largest wilderness protection measure in history . In 1983 , he was one of the first to call for the resignation of Interior Secretary James G. Watt , the nemesis of the environmental movement . And in the mid-1980s , he supported the Clean Air Act . <p> He also voted to designate the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . ' s birthday a national holiday , and bucked President Ronald Reagan and many of his political contributors to support economic sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa . He has criticized the GOP for failing to embrace tolerance of minorities , and more recently , homosexuals . His youngest sister Candace , 28 , who said she has a good relationship with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in the 1970s , recalled being so impressed by Gingrich 's vote for the Alaska Lands Act that he worked in 1980 as the freshman congressman 's campaign driver . They became close , Mankin said . Gingrich brought him in on high-level staff meetings , and picked his brain on strategy questions . On long drives , the two shared thoughts on the environment and Mankin came to see Gingrich as profoundly committed . " He said he 'd have a hard time explaining it to his daughters if elephants disappeared from the planet in their lifetimes , " Mankin said . <p> On the day before Election Day 1980 , Mankin said he approached Gingrich and told him he would not be coming to his victory party . " I had a feeling Reagan was going to be elected president , and I said , ' Newt , I hope you do n't mind , but I do n't think I could stand to be in a room full of people who love Ronald Reagan . ' " <p> In a much gentler way , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he decided at 19 to marry Jackie Battley over the objections of his parents , knowing that he would have to go to the ceremony without them . Gingrich answered Mankin as he answered his parents 18 years earlier : <p> " That 's okay . I understand . " <p> Staff writer Charles R. Babcock and staff researcher Barbara J.
