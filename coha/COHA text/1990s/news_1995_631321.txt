<p> Steve McMichael has seen the Bears-Packers rivalry from both sides of the field . A Bear from 1981 to 1993 , he finished his career with a one-year stay in Green Bay . This week he relayed his thoughts on the rivalry to Chicago Sun-Times NFL writer Dan Pompei . <p> The way I see the Bears-Packers rivalry is this : it 's like the NFL is a family and the Bears and Packers are the two brothers . This is a sibling rivalry . Like kids in a family , they compete for attention , doing things their own way . When one of their ways works better , they get the attention , and then the friendly competition turns into downright hate . <p> There are two reasons the rivalry is so intense . First are the striking similarities between the teams . Second are the stark differences between the places they play . <p> As for the similarities , they both came into the league at the inception , they 've got legendary stadiums , they 've had legendary coaches and players who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league . Their fan bases support them like no other teams in the league . Both stadiums have been sold out since Moses was a baby . <p> As for the differences , Chicago is the city of the big shoulders . There 's always something to do , places to go . And then there 's Green Bay , the all-American hometown . <p> In Chicago , I 've been to plays like " Cats " and " Phantom of the Opera " in beautiful theaters . Then I go to Green Bay and you go to the local college , the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay , for culture . That 's where we saw the student play " Keely and Du . " In Chicago , if you want Italian food you can choose between places like Rosebud and Tufanos ; you can go down the list . But in Green Bay , if you want to eat Italian you go to the Olive Garden . <p> Even with all the positives of being in Chicago , the place I would want to raise my kids would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximity of the teams , all of that fuels the rivalry . <p> It 's not so much the players but the fans who keep this smoldering . Wisconsin and Illinois are border states . This is my team , this is yours , and we draw the line at the border . <p> The fans are rabid about this game . Before they made that tunnel that leads from the locker room to the field at Lambeau Field , they had a chain-link fence on either side of the walkway . Packers fans would be lined up alongside it , jam packed against that thing , cursing and throwing beer on you . <p> It was no different at Soldier Field . They had to put the tarp up so fans could n't get at the Green Bay players going from the locker room to the field . <p> I remember one year up there , they had a refrigerator in the parking lot with William Perry 's number on it , and they were charging people to hit it with a sledgehammer . <p> We only stayed in Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear . At any time during the night , you 'd wake up and hear the revelry . <p> The people there tried to be as loud as they could . Then we started staying in Appleton , away from the frenzy . <p> This is n't all about fans , though . The Forrest Gregg-Mike Ditka feud spilled over into players . No doubt about it , Gregg condoned late hits . Ditka always classified a Packers game as a war . Give no quarter , take no quarter . When two teams are playing like that , fans are in for a lot of car crashes . <p> In between the whistles , those were the toughest , most hard-nosed games I 've ever played in , more so than playoff games . They were very physical . <p> It was a traditional way of playing football . You put your hand on the ground and start hitting people in the face . It was brutal and wrenching . It was n't a game for the meek . Games like those are where the phrase " Black and Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a football fan , for lack of a better word , so it was always a kick for me to play in that game , knowing I 'd be part of history . That 's how I 'd explain my personal success in those games . <p> I never understood why we did n't run them out of the stadium when we were playing them in the ' 80s . In the fourth quarter , we always were fighting for our lives . Everyone else killed them . Their record was n't indicative of how they played the Bears . <p> When I became a Packer in 1994 , I understood why . <p> It tore at my heart to switch sides and go from being a Bear to a Packer . It was very painful for me to be playing on the other side  --  not when we played other teams , but when we played the Bears . It was very emotional for me . After we beat the Bears in Lambeau 40-3 , I did n't even wait to hang around in the Packers locker room . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys and I knew what they were going through . I wanted to give them a few words of encouragement . <p> As a Packer , I played some , but it was n't like my career as a Bear when I was on the field all the time . In retrospect , I thank God it happened like it did . It would have been too hard for me to stand on the sidelines at Soldier Field . <p> The fans were good to me up there . Since I had been with the Bears all those years and the Packers fans had always booed me relentlessly , I was surprised at the welcome I got . They really made me feel at home . Just like Chicago , they appreciate football . <p> It has n't been easy being away from it . I 've had some bouts of depression this year . Green Bay helped hold that off for one year when the Bears were n't willing to do it . <p> It 's hard for me when I see guys I came up with and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brock playing for the Chargers the other day , and I got depressed . Vince Evans was the quarterback when I got to the Bears , and he 's still winning games for the Raiders . <p> As far as the teams are concerned , the rivalry has lost some of its edge . A lot of how the coach and organization handles it festers the rivalry . And we 've got two coaches now , Dave Wannstedt and Mike Holmgren , who are football purists . They 're not into the extracurricular way of thinking that says , just do n't beat these guys , beat them down . But it 's still as good as it gets . <p> Even as many games as I played in my career , if I could enjoy just one more day in the sun on Sunday at Lambeau or Soldier Field , I would consider it the defining moment of my career . @x PRO Should American students go to school for more time , less time , or the same amount of time as they have for most of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for the time needed to gain the core academic skills and well-rounded education necessary to thrive as individuals and to succeed in today 's complex society and high-skills economy . Students need enough time to learn to read and write well and to handle math comfortably . But they also need time to master science and technology , to grasp history and world affairs , and perhaps to learn a foreign language . Students need time to gain an appreciation of arts , music , and drama and to participate in sports . They need time for project-based learning and self-directed exploration . Younger students need time for recess . From teachers and principals to scholars and policymakers , including President Obama , more and more people recognize that for many students , the current school schedule , developed in a vastly different era , simply does not work . Across the country , more than 1,000 schools have broken the shackles of conventional schedules to expand learning time well beyond the norm . Their results show that students learn more and thrive , that working parents breathe easier when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that communities appreciate the advantages of keeping teens from loitering . Almost all high-performing charter public schools use considerably more learning time . They are notable for their success bridging the achievement gap between middle-class students and those from poor and minority communities . With 66 schools in 19 states and over 16,000 students , KIPP Academies run for 60 percent more time than conventional schools . The results ? After four years , 100 percent of KIPP 's eighth-grade classes significantly outperformed district averages in English and math . More than 80 percent of KIPP grads have gone on to college , a vastly higher rate than demographics would predict . Massachusetts adopted the first state policy to support public schools in redesigning and expanding schedules to include better and broader learning opportunities . The state pays the direct costs ( about 15 percent more for 30 percent more time ) and 26 schools with 13,500 kids are showing gains in core subjects and engaging students more deeply through new curricular opportunities . At Edwards Middle School in Boston , where about 90 percent of students are poor and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has soared . The eighth-grade gap with the state average has been narrowed by more than half in English and almost 80 percent in math in two years of expanded learning time . The school boasts an outstanding music and arts program , the only middle school football team in Boston , and an apprenticeship program for every sixth grader . Large gains . More than 75 percent of parents of students in the first 10 schools to adopt expanded learning time in Massachusetts indicated the longer day had a positive effect . Teachers report large gains in the ability to reach every student and cover all of the material in depth . It is too early to say what works best and which students benefit most . But evidence suggests expanded learning time can narrow the achievement gap while expanding opportunities for all students . This is not a one-size-fits-all innovation . Each school develops its design based on a careful assessment of student needs . To succeed in the knowledge-intensive careers of the 21st century , today 's youth must master core academic skills and build strong technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers kids the chance to build these skills and engage in classes , activities , and even internships that can excite them about learning and launch them on a path to a productive future . Every athlete , musician , or master of multiplication tables knows that practice improves performance . Common sense , and the success of the more than 1,000 pioneering schools , show that with more time well spent , our young people can thrive in the complex and promising world ahead of them . An America built on the core premise of opportunity must offer all of our children nothing less . For many kids , a school schedule developed in a vastly different era does not work .
