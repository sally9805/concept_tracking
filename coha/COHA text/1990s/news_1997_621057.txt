<p> ' MOB VIGILANTISM IS NOT JUSTICE ' <p> Editor  --  " Flyers Falsely Call Artist a Molester " . . . " Paroled Molester 's Van Firebombed " . . . " Publicized Child Molester Jailed on Parole Charge " . . . " No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime . . . nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . " <p> The first three quotes are from headlines in recent Chronicle editions , the last is from a little remembered document called the Constitution . Does anyone remember the Fifth Amendment prohibition against trial without due process ? Is firebombing a van or losing your job because of a hate campaign waged against you considered due process ? If these people have no chance in society once they 've paid their time in jail , what incentive is there for them to obey the law ? <p> What the child molesters did was undoubtedly despicable and should be punished , but the point is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that scenario , it is the anarchy of a vengeful mob which determines what is and is not justice , rather than a court of law . <p> ROBIJN VAN GIESEN <p> DEBORAH DAVIS-PRICE <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> PUT AN END TO THE NEA <p> Editor  --  Please . . please , some precision in your writing of the effort by those in Congress to defund the National Endowment for the Arts . <p> In his account printed July 12 , The Chronicle 's Louis Freedberg writes that this attempt " . . . sent a strong symbolic message of hostility to the arts . . . " <p> Nonsense ! The attempt sent a strong symbolic message of hostility to the funding , by government coerced tax dollars , of certain activities deemed " art " by a self-appointed " Arts " establishment . <p> The " arts " ( small " a " ) flourished in this country before the NEA ; they will flourish to the extent individuals wish to support them after the NEA . <p> A free people need no Beltway Medici @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco <p> . <p> CONNERLY 'S CHUTZPAH <p> Editor  --  An old Yiddish joke defines " chutzpah " as the audacity of the person who kills his parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he 's an orphan . Now , thanks to Ward Connerly , we have a new definition . <p> Here you have a man who spearheaded the drive to eliminate affirmative action at the University of California , a man who bragged to Dan Rather about having started a " counter- revolution " in race relations , a man who has allied himself with people who opposed both the desegregation of America 's schools in the 1950s and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . Now Mr. Connerly has the chutzpah to accuse Dean Herma Hill Kay of being responsible for the catastrophic decline of minorities at Boalt Hall School of Law ( Chronicle , July 12 ) . <p> As a member of the Boalt community , I can attest that Dean Kay and the rest of the faculty have spent endless hours trying to reconcile a commitment to diversity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrolling exactly the same number of African Americans next year ( one ) as were enrolled at the University of Mississippi in 1962 , the fault does not lie with Dean Kay . Mr. Connerly has said repeatedly that he wants to turn the civil rights clock back more than 30 years . Now that he has succeeded , he has no one but himself to blame . <p> KRISTIN LUKER <p> Professor of Sociology and <p> Professor in the Jurisprudence <p> and Social Policy Program <p> Boalt Hall School of Law <p> UC Berkeley <p> . <p> TAX BREAKS FOR THE FEW <p> Editor  --  So now Governor Pete Wilson and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer are playing kissy-face about a state tax cut . Let 's hope this does n't turn out like last year , when Pete and Bill cut a deal for a 5 percent bank and corporation tax cut  --  costing the state treasury $ 230 million this year alone . Last year was also when the wealthiest 1 percent of California taxpayers got a $ 900 million-a-year state income tax cut . <p> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tax cuts ? Will the money come from again " suspending " the renters ' tax credit , and forcing renters to pay higher taxes ? Will the money come from again cutting welfare benefit levels , and continuing to shred the safety net for low-income workers and the poor ? Will the money come from the higher DMV rates proposed by our chauffeur-driven governor ? <p> Year after year , those guys in Sacramento hand out tax breaks to the rich and the corporate elite , and year after year the rest of us pay the bill . <p> MARC NORTON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CYPRESS FLIMFLAM <p> Editor  --  The recent revelations of the absurd costs of the new Cypress Freeway should make motorists and taxpayers retch . The Caltrans folk responsible should be tarred , feathered and run out of the state on a rail . <p> Nearly eight years ago the Loma Prieta earthquake caused the collapse of the vital , and very busy , Cypress double-decked freeway . Caltrans and the Oakland government/populace played footsy with one another for years deciding how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dividing some of the nastiest neighborhoods in the Bay Area . <p> The discussions were carried out as though there had never been a freeway above Cypress Street . Well there was one , and it was there for a long , long time . Right of way did not have to be acquired , contaminated soil did not have to be removed , few new intersections had to be designed . Common sense , and prudent use of our dollars , dictated that the freeway be replaced on the same route , and immediately . The road blocks inserted by the West Oakland pressure groups should have been given the short shrift they deserved . <p> Ride BART through West Oakland and see the new freeway crossing BART twice , and when you do , realize that all of us have been conned , flimflammed and scammed on a billion-dollar scale . <p> BOB WELLS <p> Albany <p> . <p> NEW RULES OF THE ROAD <p> Editor  --  I would like to take issue with the common complaint concerning bicyclists ' noncompliance with traffic laws . <p> Stop signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles , not bicycles . If our streets were designed for bikes , intersections would have merging circles like those on the UC Davis campus . Braking to a stop and then accelerating at each intersection robs precious momentum and much of the enjoyment and therefore reason for cycling . Sure , cyclists should stop at traffic lights when there is cross traffic . Insisting , however , that at a stop sign a cyclist yield to an automobile whose driver simply has to press a foot pedal is unreasonable . Cars should yield to cyclists at stop signs . To require that a bicycle act like a car is impractical . <p> As for the Critical Mass Ride , with over 17 million registered cars in California averaging over 3,000 pounds each ( and growing , thanks to all those silly SUVs ) , it would appear that automobiles are reaching critical mass , not bicycles . <p> ANN R. KEY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SUPES ' PRIORITIES <p> Editor  --  Ironic , is it not , that the Board of Supervisors will hold hearings on a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off-leash dogs at Ocean Beach ( Chronicle , July 11 )  --  yet refuse to hold hearings on the brutal conditions in San Francisco 's live animal markets , where they could actually make a difference ? <p> ERIC MILLS <p> Action for Animals <p> Oakland <p> . <p> COMING SOON . . . <p> Editor  --  The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that in about 25 years about 18 million people will be added to the California population , which is the equivalent of two more Los Angeles County 's , or 24 more San Francisco 's . <p> Which means that in about 10 to 15 years motor vehicles will be virtually useless in the urban areas of California . It wo n't be possible to drive anywhere in the Bay Area faster than you can walk . Investors should start selling auto stocks , and start buying shoe stocks . <p> RICHARD LEWIS <p> Alamo
