With the passing of the masters comes the pride of a new generation . Time to update your collection <p> Stan Getz . . . Dizzy Gillespie . . . When these greats left us not long ago  --  the latest in a string of jazz giants to check out  --  you probably figured that the music was dying , too . But take a troll through your local disc shop . You 'll notice that the jazz bins are fatter than ever , full of name you 've never heard of and faces just past the pimples stage . There 's a new generation of serious players coming up . Inspired by and , in some cases , aided by the young trumpeter and jazz guru Wynton Marsalis , these twenty- and thirty something play so well it 's scary . <p> So what ? Consider this : Louis Armstrong , Benny Goodman and Charlie Parker all redefined jazz while still in their twenties . Except for Marsalis , it 's not yet obvious who the geniuses of the Nineties are , but contenders abound among this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sampling of their best recordings . Not all the promising cats appear as headliners on our list . But since they tend to hang around in each other 's packs , you can catch the sounds of many on a relatively few discs . Christian McBride , for example , is a monster bassist who plays only supporting roles here , as do up-and-coming saxophonists Wessell Anderson , Teodross Avery , Seamus Blake , Vincent Herring and David Sanchez , among others . ( Even Marsalis makes a few guest appearances , though he goes by his sideman pseudonym E. Dankworth . ) The music covers lots of ground , from solo trumpet to elegant piano trio to brass-filled septet ; from straight-ahead to updated hard bop to variations and combinations with no useful labels  --  all of it tinged with a youthful exuberance . There are the occasional naive excesses , but you wo n't hear any nose flutes or fingernails on chalkboards . When Stan and Diz look down from jazz heaven these days , we figure they 're tapping their toes .
