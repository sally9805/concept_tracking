<p> TEN YEARS AGO Sid Caesar was a recovering alcoholic , pill head and manic depressive . This man , who had made TV history as one of its funniest comedians during the live " Golden Age " of the early 1950s , had just exposed his least funny sides in the deeply analytic best-selling autobiography " Where Have I Been ? " <p> After decades of self-abuse and self-doubts that had left him teetering on the brink of mental and physical ruin , the reborn comedian was looking ahead to a bright future , telling a Chronicle interviewer in the closing months of 1982 that " I feel happy and relaxed and if career things happen , that 's fine . But they do n't have to happen . I have self-esteem no matter what else happens . . . Comedy is coming back . We need it , desperately . It 's as essential as bread . And I 'd like to have a couple of pieces of crust . " <p> Caesar has done better than break off crust or crumbs . He has sliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life . Almost two years ago he rejoined Imogene Coca , his onetime co-star on TV 's " Your Show of Shows , " still considered one of the best written and performed variety shows of the early days of live TV ( 1950-54 ) . <p> Since then they have revived many of their most popular comedy routines into an anthology stage show , " Together Again , " which has been presented in various parts of the country in short engagements . It is now scheduled to go to the Helen Hayes Theater on Broadway in May . <p> But first the team will perform for a month in San Francisco . The Caesar-Coca show opens Wednesday and plays through March 22 at the Marines Memorial Theater , 609 Sutter Street . The dynamic duo will be supported by actor Lee Delano ( surrogate for the two guys who used to do the supporting TV bits , Carl Reiner and Howard Morris ) and the Rolf Barnes Orchestra . <p> What 's amazing is that the two stars  --  42 years after they first met to co-star for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( the forerunner to " Show of Shows " )  --  still are able to perform their sketches with nary a change in dialogue or attitude . Even the ages of the characters have n't been altered , with Coca still portraying her stripteaser , Miss Jet Lag , and a parody of Sophia Loren in a " Bicycle Thief " movie parody . <p> Although Coca is now 82 , and Caesar will be 70 in September , they bring the same vitality and compatibility to their comedy that they did as " youngsters . " While the material is venerable , having been originally written with the help of Neil Simon , Larry Gelbart , Woody Allen and Mel Brooks , Caesar and Coca have remained just as ageless . <p> Both are expressive solo artists in their own right , and in combination display polished talents that are rarely seen now that comedy teams have vanished . It is an evening of physical and intellectual comedy made up of delightful dialects , mime , monologues and sketches . Their skits are satires of situations we have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always dealt with the familiar , touching on what they call " the truth in comedy . " <p> There is the famous Hickenloopers ' marital-spat sketch , set to the music of Beethoven 's Fifth , and the " At the Movies " sketch in which they portray strangers who meet in a theater and fall instantly in love , even though Coca 's boyfriend is with her . <p> Since the death of her husband , actor King Donovan , six years ago , the elfin , saucer-eyed Coca has lived full time in New York . Although she was recovering from an illness , she sounded chipper and chatty on the phone recently . She spoke with the enthusiasm of one who had just discovered an old school chum . <p> " Sid and I have been together so long , " she said , as if even she could n't believe it . " I guess we 've been together longer than any other two people in the world . We 've always been friends over the years . We get along fine . We 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about billing or who gets the best line . We 've always taken the attitude that if something works for the other , that 's fine . It 's the act that counts . I guess that 's why the duo has worked for so long . " <p> But , she wanted to add , " I do n't understand why we get along so well . It does n't make any sense . I mean , we 're quite different . When we 're not working , we do n't see much of each other . It 's not that we go out of of our way to avoid each other , we just go our separate ways . Each of us has a different set of friends . And , Sid lives on the West Coast , while I live in the East . " <p> Does something magically " click " when the two get together on a stage ? " In a way , " replied Coca . " We really know what the other is thinking . I 'm always ready for Sid , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She described Caesar as " very quiet , very intelligent . Such a sharp mind . He 's not shy , but he 's reticent . He has a brilliant sense of comedy . His dialects are incredible . " <p> Why do the sketches they created in the early 1950s still work so well today ? She laughed heartily . " As long as the situation is set in reality , everyone can relate . Such as a husband and wife arguing because she 's just wrecked the car . Once you 've established a believable premise , you can fly off into fantasy or absurdity all you want . You can soar into outer space if it pleases you . " <p> What Coca has found amazing is that " the show is not just attracting our old audience from the TV days . All different ages are coming . It 's not all nostalgia . Something bigger than that is at work . " <p> The same day Coca was interviewed , Caesar was in San Francisco . Having just finished his daily 300 sit-ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan-Pacific Hotel suite dressed as young as he looked , and felt  --  in tight-fitting blue pants , a bright reddish-pink shirt and glistening brown boots . A silver belt buckle gleamed from his slender waist . <p> During the past decade , he explained , he has continued his tough daily workout schedule , eschewing alcohol and pills . He lives by a positive attitude that allows him to enjoy everything around him . Nothing is taken for granted . <p> In " Together Again , " Caesar reprises his famous Professor Ludwig Von Knowitall and portrays a gum-ball machine , a young boy at a dance trying to get up courage to ask a girl to dance with him , a 6-month-old baby eager for feeding time and a pianist having a hard night at a concert . <p> " Our show is not about today . It 's in a timeless place somewhere , " he stressed . " It 's a kind of art form that is n't done much anymore . " <p> When asked to define comedy , Caesar said , " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that makes you laugh , and it can verge on tragedy . Because laughter and crying are almost the same emotion . Laugh too hard and you cry . Cry too hard and you laugh . " <p> Caesar agreed with Coca that " comedy has to be about the truth . " But , he added , " we do n't tell jokes . We deal in characters , in people caught up in situations you 've been in . Such as a man about to get married , who 's thinking all his doubts as he walks down the aisle . How many of us have been through that ? " As for parody sketches , which he did constantly on " Your Show of Shows , " " You ca n't parody the mundane , only the classical , that which is known to an audience . " <p> Asked about the " click " that occurs when he and Coca appear onstage , he laughed and shook his head . " No click , no lightbulbs going on , " he said . " Performing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . I swear , she can read my mind . And I guess I read hers . That 's why we 're doing this . You find a partner that works and you stick with it . . . She says we never fight ? It 's true . The main concern should be , ' Does it get a laugh ? ' That 's all that counts . What 's good for the show . " <p> How do they differ ? " Ah , I 'm the gruff one . She 's the gentle one . If we were the Odd Couple , I 'd be the sloppy one . " <p> Reminded of Coca 's age , he shook his head again disbelievingly . " What an amazing woman . This incredible transformation occurs when she walks on a stage . She becomes those characters . I believe those characters . The audience believes those characters . " <p> Caesar will do three dialect sketches during " Together Again , " and to demonstrate he did voices in French , Italian , Spanish and German . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gibberish that sounded true to the languages . " It 's what I call the language of song . I just ordered a meal in four languages . " <p> Each day , Caesar still talks into a tape recorder in an ongoing dialogue he has had with himself for more than 10 years . Sid talks to Sidney . Sidney replies to Sid . " It 's my way of straighting out what 's mentally bothering me . It 's a way of discovering myself . Freud made it all a mystery but the clouds do n't have to open or the earth does n't have to split . You simply verbalize the problem , and you can make friends with yourself . <p> " Too many of us hate ourselves , " he continued . " And we have forms of punishment we self-inflict , such as eating foods we should n't , or promising to start a diet tomorrow while we eat today . Do what I do and next time you feel like a chocolate mousse , take one spoonful and roll it around in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the best it 's ever going to taste . It is n't going to get any better . Now , push the dessert away . You do n't need it anymore . You 've satisfied yourself without stuffing yourself . " <p> Caesar seemed to bristle a little when asked if he intended to have his show taped for television . " No , " he answered quickly . " Once it 's taped then everyone 's seen it . I want to keep going around the country performing this show wherever it 's wanted . This is a live event . Live is beautiful . When you 're live you have nothing to fall back on but your own resourcefulness . This is the greatest challenge . "
