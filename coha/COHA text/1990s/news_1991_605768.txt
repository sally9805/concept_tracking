<p> The mist-shrouded highlands here are Guatemala 's killing fields , where tens of thousands of Mayan Indians were wiped out in the early 1980s in a counterinsurgency program that was probably Latin America 's most sustained and efficient massacre in recent history . <p> Public airing of what happened has been taboo in Guatemala , largely because the terror wrought by the army and its surrogates , called civil patrols , has slowed but never really stopped . Like the uncounted victims decomposing in the acidic , volcanic soil , the truth here is underground . <p> Which is exactly where Clyde Snow , a craggy Oklahoman with a slow drawl and a quick wit , intends to find it . " The ground is like a beautiful woman , " Snow said with a twinkle , gnawing on a Hoyo de Monterey cigar . " If you treat her gently , she 'll tell you all her secrets . " <p> Snow is probably the United States ' most renowned grave-digging detective , the grand old man of an elite academic specialty known as forensic anthropology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them decades old , he reconstructs causes of death and , in the case of Guatemala , often grisly bits of history that officials have decreed dead and buried . <p> His work , under the sponsorship of the human rights groups Americas Watch and Physicians for Human Rights , is testing the stated commitment of Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano 's civilian government to justice and human rights . And it is challenging the army and its civil patrols to face up to their role in the murderous counterinsurgency campaign of the 1980s . <p> " People will never respect the law until there 's justice , and a good place to start is with murder " cases , Snow said . " If you can make people feel they 're not going to get away with it ... . That 's all we 're asking  --  that you go to court and stand up to be judged . " <p> But in Guatemala , that is quite a bit . The justice system here has never really called military men to account for the killings that are part of everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the system , and there have been prosecutions in several high-visibility human rights cases . So far he 's been supportive of Snow 's work , even providing police protection for Snow 's exhumations . <p> But here in the highlands , about 80 miles northwest of the capital , the reformist impulse is a distant echo . When Snow began his exhumations this summer , the local civil patrollers , who are suspected in many of the killings , spread the story that Snow meant to make a broth of the old bones he unearthed , spiced with onions and tomatoes . <p> Some villagers who have helped him to locate unmarked graves or identify old bodies have been threatened . Briefly in August , the president of the supreme court ordered a halt to the excavations . He said the civil patrols were intimidating villagers who were helping Snow and his team of young Guatemalan doctors , archaeologists and anthropologists . <p> Snow , of Norman , Okla. , has dug up evidence of Custer 's Last Stand at Little Bighorn , the victims of American mass murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentine military repression in the 1970s . In Brazil , he identified the remains of the infamous Nazi death camp doctor Josef Mengele . And as a consultant for NASA in the 1960s , he tracked down survivors of suicide jumps from San Francisco 's Golden Gate Bridge to assess the impact of free falls on bone structures . ( He said most of the survivors mentioned a change of mind on the way down . ) <p> This career has made him a highly paid consultant , the subject of a laudatory book and something of an American folk hero . His extensive work in Latin America , especially Argentina , has left him with a selective Spanish vocabulary , specializing in the lexicon of restaurants , bars and morgues . <p> But despite his breadth of experience , Snow said he has never worked anyplace quite like Guatemala , where , as he put it , " people get killed as if they were some sort of particularly noxious agricultural pest . " <p> Human rights groups have blamed most of the killing on the Guatemalan army , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army 's strategy was to defeat the guerrillas by forcing civilians to take sides : Those who backed the rebels , or perhaps only tolerated them , often were eliminated . Those who fought them , such as the civil patrols , were rewarded . <p> " The army said we had to take action against the guerrillas , or else it would be us who were responsible , " said Tomas Tol Cagua , a former civil patrol member near the village of Chontala . " We were humiliated and scared , but the army would kill us if we did n't obey . " <p> The result was a strategy of such brutality that " the Guatemalan Solution " has become shorthand in Latin America for wholesale , indiscriminate killing . While it did not erase the insurgency completely , it left the rebels unable to mount a serious military threat . But at the same time , the army 's strategy caused untold numbers of civilian casualties , with entire villages razed in a scorched-earth campaign . <p> " It 's too bad Milwaukee mass murder suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be a general by now , " Snow said with disgust . " In my line of work , you hear a lot about Guatemala . It 's like the Old West , like the frontier , like ' Shane . ' It 's like every cliche you can think of : white hats , good guys , bad guys , vigilantes , the marshal coming to town . ... It 's almost like the movies being replayed . " <p> If there 's a marshal in this script , it 's the Texas-born Snow . At 63 , his face has turned jowly and his eyes are hooded . But his savvy and his knapsack of tools and his battered green canvas hat still give him the air of Indiana Jones  --  with a few years ' extra mileage . <p> In his wallet he carries a heavy gold badge , which turns out on close inspection to be from the Illinois Coroners ' Association , for which he has worked . " I 'm not going to back off from the civil patrols , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , when you get in a problem with local law enforcement , whoever has the biggest badge wins . " <p> To Indian peasants who have watched Snow work , he is something of a magician . It is unheard of here to defy the civil patrols , let alone unearth evidence of executions . To the civil patrols , Snow is a threat , and they have told villagers that he is really a guerrilla masquerading as a gringo man of science . <p> On a gray afternoon , as the clouds swept in over the volcanoes on the horizon , Snow led a few journalists through lush cornfields atop a wind-swept ridge . When he arrived at the dig , his team was already scraping away the rich soil with trowels and soft brushes . A skeleton , still fully clothed and wearing rubber boots , was beginning to emerge from a three-foot-deep pit . <p> A few policemen hung around the fringes , along with a local judge and perhaps a dozen Indians  --  laconic men in plain Western dress and stout women in the brilliantly colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio blared pop music . <p> This was the 27th skeleton Snow has unearthed since he began working in Guatemala this year . Before the bones were swept free of dirt , Snow was already noting its distinctive appearance  --  part of a pattern repeated in each excavation he has made in Guatemala . <p> " We 're beginning to see characteristics that are typically Mongoloid , " he said . The skeletons are short , with prominent brows , heavy cheekbones , shovel-shaped incisors and a low nasal bridge that creates a broader nose . <p> Snow said the basic structure of all the skulls he has seen is the same : Indian , usually male , in the teens and twenties . Almost no mestizos  --  people of mixed Indian and European blood . <p> In Guatemala , the killings in the countryside targeted poor Indians almost exclusively . The effect was to reinforce an already intense division  --  mestizos vs . Indians , which often means haves vs. have-nots . That has been a lesson for Snow , and a sharp contrast with other countries where he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " In Argentina , the repression was directed at a very different social class , upper-middle-class people and intellectuals , the middle class . About a third of the victims were females , " said Snow . " Here that 's not the case . We 're digging up Indian males . " <p> The skeleton emerged from its grave and the bones were placed one by one on a sheet of cardboard nearby . Dirt around the body was collected and sifted for clues : a bullet fragment or casing might be found . Examining the bones one by one , Snow noticed some fragmentation behind the ear and first vertebra , and guessed that the man may have been shot with a small-caliber bullet in the base of the neck . His preliminary conclusion was later borne out on closer inspection in the morgue . <p> " Every bone has got its own little story to tell , like a finger bone with a fracture might identify someone through a medical history , " Snow said . <p> Before this site , Snow or teams he trained exhumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , were the remains of a man who evidently had been tied to a tree and killed by repeated blows from a machete to his back . Interviews with people in the area indicated the army had made villagers take turns hacking as a way to spread blame for the execution . Even the man 's relatives were forced to take part , Snow said . <p> The next three digs unearthed multiple victims . In one , Snow said , there were six cadavers , apparently mowed down , then burned . Heavy-caliber , copper-jacketed bullets were found at the site . <p> In another grave were another seven skeletons , each shot in a similar manner . And in another , Snow said , he found 13 bodies , all with hands tied behind them and with close-range .22-caliber gunshot wounds in the skulls . <p> While the work has proceeded apace , there have been frustrations , Snow said . One has been putting together a team with the commitment , expertise and patience to maintain the work in his absence . <p> Another challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unmarked , and Snow and his team have no funds for ground-penetrating radar , a $ 20,000 device that can detect subsurface irregularities . Rather , they must rely on the help and memories of villagers , many of whom have been intimidated by the civil patrols . <p> Perhaps the most formidable obstacle has been communicating with reticent Indians , many of whom speak little or no Spanish . Snow said he relies on a young Guatemalan anthropology student to draw the villagers out , but the job is difficult and at times tedious . <p> " Here we have cultural problems , linguistic problems , you name it , " he said . " But there are good reasons to do it . One is humanitarian : It 's very cruel not to know what happened to your loved ones  --  just like with the families of MIAs . The whole process of grieving is suspended , it goes on for many years and passes from one generation to another . Very often , once the families have the bones , it helps them get over the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a chance for justice . If there 's the ability and will to prosecute , the scientific evidence we gather can be used in trials . <p> " There 's the historic record , so revisionists ca n't come along and say , ' No , this did n't happen . ' It 's very difficult to argue with a skull with a bullet in its head . "
