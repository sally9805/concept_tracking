The Christmas tree on the end of the wooden bar was small , but real . The faint scent of evergreen filled the room . The tree was sparse , with a single string of lights draped across the scraggly limbs . The branches sagged under the burden of the colors . The afternoon bar was empty except for two men sitting and sipping longnecks . They were hard-looking cowboys in their mid-thirties , drifters , the type who follow rodeos , take odd jobs , and drive dented pickups . They lived without roots or family . One was bearlike , with thick shoulders and a full , flaming beard . He wore a shapeless , sweat-stained Stetson and a ratty Army jacket , Vietnam issue . The jacket was open against a December afternoon warm even for central Texas . An indented cheek , a turned eyebrow , and a traced forehead defined an abundance of past character . His companion was leaner , darker , with angular features , a thin nose , and ice-blue eyes . He favored his left leg and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty , wide-brimmed hat pulled low over a sweep of black hair . A pair of greasy leather work gloves sprouted from a hip pocket . The cuffs of his denim jacket were turned up , revealing corded wrists and a flashy watch . The two cowboys were engaged in low but animated conversation . The hats and shoulders tilted inward . The rough boots pawed and scrabbled at the foot rail . On the dull mirror , near the high-school football schedule , was a poster announcing the local big-buck contest . Many towns scattered across the mesquite and scrub oak and prickly pear have such contests , regional events entered mostly by local citizens . The top award in this one was a .270 rifle , fitted with a 3X-9X scope  --  a prize worth aiming for . " I ai n't kidding you , Red , " the dark one named Randall was saying . " He was the best buck I 've seen in a long time and right here in the creekbottom by the Saunders windmill . " Red hunched closer . " How many points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped back in the brush . He was a non-typical  --  I saw five up plus a big fork on one side . The main thing was how heavy he was . No kidding , his rack was like baseball bats . There 's nothing nowhere near him in the contest . One solid big hoss , you can believe that . " Randall thumped his empty Shiner down and raised two fingers . A lackluster waitress stood up from the corner table , where she had been listening to scratchy music . A two-step twang of unpardonable cheating and insurmountable misery followed her . She lifted a pair of dripping bottles from the cooler and handed them across the counter . Red picked at the wet label on the dark bottle , then looked at his friend closely , conspiratorially . " You do n't hear of bucks that big from around here , leastwise not very often . It sounds like that buck Carlos says he saw in his lights . " " That 's what I figured . Carlos was n't that far from that tank . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windmill tank . He has n't been spooked at all . Old Man Saunders keeps it posted , but we can hunt that pasture . " The dark cowboy smiled thinly around a tilted bottle . " You know that I know Saunders " daughter . " " I hear you know her pretty well . " " Well , that 's a fact . " Randall traced a line on the bar top . " All we 've got to do is set up a tripod stand near where that draw cuts the windmill tank . He 'll be coming to water in this hot weather , you can bet on that . Pow ! I know just the spot . A 100-yard shot , max . Anybody could nail it  --  maybe even you . " Red muttered into his beard and slapped playfully sideways , almost knocking Randall from his stool . Then the bearlike man fixed his eyes on a knot above the mirror . " That 's a good ten-point Cody 's got . That there 's a hard deer to beat . " " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can stick Cody 's rack inside this hoss and have air all around . It ai n't even close . " The screen door opened against a gash of dusty light . A skinny kid walked in and spun onto the stool alongside Randall . Eric was thirteen , all elbows and freckles , and needed a haircut . His torn jeans and faded shirt were overpowered by a preposterously large silver belt buckle , the embossed type rodeo champions win . Randall wore one , too . The kid was proud . He was sitting with his heroes . " Ma said to thank you-all for fixin ' the gate . She said she really appreciates you-all takin ' the time to help her out . She also said you had something to see me about . " Randall nodded . " Well , Susan  --  your ma  --  is a fine lady . " He gave a wry laugh . " She ca n't help the hand she was dealt no more'n you can help the bull you draw . " The bad bull remained a vivid memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gonzales fairgrounds , and a big ride would vault him to the big Houston rodeo . He drew Tinkerbell , a terrible black bull with thick horns and murderous red eyes . The bull boiled with madness , surging and raging in the tight chute as the cowboy settled in . Nobody , they said , had " stayed stuck " for a full 8-second ride on Tink . Randall took a deep breath , tugged the wide-brimmed hat , and nodded . The gate swung open and the crowd roared as the huge animal lunged and twisted sideways into the arena . Randall was good ; he lasted longer than most . Somewhere between 6 and 7 seconds he ejected over the top . The great head hooked up and a horn opened his thigh , and ruined his flight . The hat went sailing and he fell wrong , breaking his knee , and the cry was lost in the crowd . Eric and his mother saw the fall . Seconds later , they watched as the bull turned and , with a kick of black dirt and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting , rolling cowboy . The rodeo clown was too far , too slow , maybe too scared to intervene . But Red jumped the fence , lowered his shoulder , and charged like a blocking fullback into the bull . Some say he staggered the animal . Embellishments aside , he did turn Tinkerbell from the motionless Randall and , showing remarkable speed for a such big man , outran the ensuing charge across the arena . That night in Randall 's hospital room , Susan brought a small vase and a trembling smile . Seeing the drifter almost killed had been a profound shock . Maybe , her conscience admitted , she wanted him as more than a friend . He was flawed and he was trouble , for sure , but he was easy to like . And , he seemed to care for the boy ; the old rodeo buckle had been given with a casual shrug but Eric 's eyes had gone round . It was a man-thing , and the boy needed that . Susan was in her late thirties , slim and reasonably attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bad divorce and a sorry job were dimming the sparkle and graying the auburn . She needed to move , to start new and fresh , for her sake as well as Eric 's , but she could n't afford to quit and she did n't know where to go . It was easier to " think about it tomorrow . " The cowboy had been an exciting change . They dated sparingly , without commitment , and the relationship drifted into more of a friendship than a romance . But as she placed the flowers on the hospital table she wished things had worked out differently . Young Eric stood wide-eyed at the foot of the bed . He stared first at the groggy Randall , then at Red propped in the corner . " You almost knocked that ol " bull over . If you 'd had a rope , you could 've hog-tied him right there ! " Red snorted . " Why , hell , boy , I just bounced off him like a horsefly . If ol ' Randall had n't been doing such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never knowed I was there . " Red paused , grinning at his bruised and bandaged partner . " Of course , about that time I reckon it would n't have taken no Sir Lawrence Olivier to play-act that part . " Randall mended quickly , even if somewhat crookedly . During the rehabilitation , he and Red tended stock and rode fences on nearby ranches . It was during a fence ride that Randall had seen the big buck . Plotting to win the deer contest was the big and immediate goal that Eric had interrupted . The boy spun from the bar stool and paced the hardwood . " So what 'd you want me for ? " Red swiveled with a ponderous squeak to face the boy . " Oh , yeah , " he said casually . " Me and Randall are going deer hunting in the morning . We reckon you can come along if you want . " " For real ! " The cowboys had shown him a bit of roping and riding , and joked with him about chasing the girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Randall thumped the boy 's shoulder with a knuckly fist . " That 's right , if you promise not to shoot old Red here , thinking he 's a wild boar . I think he 's wanted in Mexico , least-wise for sure a few places in San Antonio and Laredo , but we get along , the two of us . I 'd sure hate to come back and find you 've got him strung up in a tree . " " I do n't have a gun , not even a shotgun . We ca n't afford no gun . " " I got one you can borrow , " said Red . " A .30/06 , a real buck-thumper , but you can handle it . She 's scoped with a 3-to-9 and shoots 1 inch high at 100 yards with a 165 Federal Premium ; all you got to do is squeeze her off . " " I 'll take real good care of it ! " The boy was dazzled and awed to be addressed matter-of-fact in such matters as ballistics and bullet weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall took a sip and looked sideways at Red . He turned to the boy . " Kid , you 're welcome to come hunt , but you 've got to understand a couple of things . First , me and Red are going to be leaving here next week , right after Christmas . We 're moving on . " We got us good jobs on a big spread down near Carrizo Springs . Now , do n't look so down . You knowed all along we were just passing through . We 're moving on and that 's that . You 're old enough to understand the way these things are . " " Now , the second thing is , you 're not going to actually hunt with us tomorrow . Red and me have got some serious business at hand . You 're a beginner and we do n't want you hanging on us and maybe spooking our deer . " The boy 's eagerness wilted . Red 's battered , round face poked around Randall 's shoulder . " Do n't look like you got cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to come with us , sure we do ; we just want to split up , that 's all . " Randall stood with lazy grace and hooked thumbs under his buckle . The bright silver caught a flicker from the tree . He looked straight at the boy . " Red and me have talked it over and what we 're going to do is put you on a stand off by yourself . If you get a shot , it 'll be close . It 'll be a gift . " Your stand is easy to find . It 's right by a windmill tank . " <p>
