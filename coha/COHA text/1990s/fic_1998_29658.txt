They were asleep , father and son , when the train pulled into New Haven and all the lights went out . Dylan opened his eyes , surprised by the sudden darkness . " Where are we ? " he cried . " Dad , we 're lost ! " " I 'm awake , " said Ben . " We 're not lost . " " You 're asleep , " Dylan said , accusingly . " Asleep ! " In Ben 's lap were the catalogs of all the colleges they were going to visit : Yale , Harvard , Bowdoin , Colby , Dartmouth , Middlebury , Williams , Amherst , Wesleyan . These catalogs were slick , their pages full of kids in sweaters . Ben Floyd was embarrassed by his son 's anguish . " It 's okay , " he said . " I 'm not asleep anymore . " They collected their bags and walked through the coach . " This stop is New Haven , " said the conductor . " Next stop , Providence . " They stepped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich with the smell of creosote and brake shoes . " You smell that , son , " Ben said . " That 's what it smells like . " " What smells like ? " Dylan said . " College ! " Ben said . Ben looked through the crowd of people , most of whom were now moving toward large escalators . " We need to go up a flight , " he said . " Down here is only where the trains are . " Dylan shook his head and walked toward the escalator . Some pretty girls were walking in front of them . One of them wore a sweatshirt that read YALE . Another was carrying a paperback book by Immanuel Kant titled The Prolegomena to Any Further Metaphysics . They looked at Dylan , then at his father , then looked away . " We 're coming into the main station now , " Ben announced , as they ascended into the waiting room . He jerked his head gently , whichwas one of Ben 's annoying tics . To Dylan , it often looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his eardrums . " Thanks , Dad , " Dylan said . He was hoping the girls would look in his direction again , but they did not . They entered the main waiting room . The place looked like a Greek temple , fallen on hard times . Marble columns stretched toward the distant ceiling . Long wooden benches stood in echelons beside the stairs that led below . There were billboards for the army . Sound echoed in the great space . " I do n't see Uncle Lefty , " Dylan said . " Would you recognize him ? " Ben said . " It 's been almost seven years . " " I do n't know , " Dylan said . They stared into the moving crowd . Dylan tried rearranging the features of oncoming strangers so that they might , for an instant , resemble his uncle . It was possible , Dylan thought , that Lefty could have somehow changed over the years . It was something to hope for , anyway . " Maybe they 're outside , " Ben said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here , " Dylan said . " We 're lost again . " " We 're not lost , " Ben said . They walked out into the October sunshine . Cars were pulled up around the curb . A man with a white glove and a whistle was flagging down taxis . An astonishingly loud horn blasted , causing father and son to jump suddenly . Dylan covered his eyes for a moment as if to wield off a crushing blow . Ben looked at his son , felt pity for him . A voice cried out . " Hey ! " it said . " Dickweed ! " Coming toward them was Cousin Juddy . He was wearing a baseball cap that bore the legend VILLANOVA WILDCATS . He smiled broadly . A set of plastic rings bearing five cans of Budweiser dangled from one hand . The other hand held an open can . The horn blasted again . Parked on the curb behind the impending Juddy was a Winnebago the size of a Burger King . At the wheel was Uncle Lefty . " C'man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked ! " " You 're wrong , Dad , " Dylan said . " We are lost . " " Dickweed , " Juddy said again , fondly . He held up his thumb , which had a small scar on it , traversing the thumbprint . Dylan held up his thumb , which had a matching scar . " Hi , Juddy , " said Dylan . Juddy made a sudden , sweeping gesture with one hand , as if he were slashing the air with an invisible sword . " Whsshsthssht , " he said . " Hello , Judson , " Ben said . " You 're looking well . " " Whatever , " Juddy said . He peeled a Bud off of the six pack ring and handed it to Dylan . " Brewdog ? " " No thanks , " Dylan said . It was strange to see his cousin after all this time . He had changed since they were kids . He had grown into a different person , somehow . He reminded Dylan of some sort of bug now , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Lefty honked the horn of the Winnebago again . Juddy pressed a beer into his cousin 's hand . " Tell you what , " he said . " You save this for later . " " Okay , " Dylan said , taking the beer . The girls from Yale were stepping into a nearby cab . A woman with a kind face , one of their mothers , was getting into the front seat . She looked at Dylan for a moment as if she had forgotten his name . Somebody 's mom , Dylan thought . It must be nice , to have one . They turned to look at the Winnebago . " Is that your car ? " Dylan said . Juddy shook his head . " It 's not a car , man , " Juddy said . They walked toward it . " It 's a great big thing . Burns gas like a airplane ! " Uncle Lefty blasted the horn again , even though they were standing right there . " Hey , we do n't got all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dylan said . " I guess we just climb aboard . " " Well , dude , " Juddy said . " I guess you just . " They walked to the far side of the Winnebago and climbed up the stairs . Uncle Lefty turned from his position behind the wheel to shake their hands , although at first Dylan thought he was going to ask them for their tickets or something . He was a large man with thick stubble . In one hand he held a submarine sandwich . " Lefty , " Ben said , and reached forward to shake his brother 's hand . Lefty had to move the sandwich from his right hand to his left before he could shake . As the men clasped hands , Lefty 's lower lip began to move in a delicate vibration of sorrow . He stood suddenly and hugged Ben , his arms wrapping around his brother . Oil from the submarine began to drip onto the back of Ben 's shirt . " I love this guy , " Lefty said . " I love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face . " Let 's never fight again , okay ? Okay ? " Ben nodded grimly . " It was n't my idea , fighting . " He looked into the guts of the Winnebago . A beautiful woman in her late forties sat at a table next to a picture window . She was wearing a leotard top and a pair of black jeans . Her blonde hair fell nearly to her waist . " Hey , " Lefty said , escorting the men into the camper . " Meet Chlo ? . The new Mrs. Floyd ! You know what I thought when I first saw Chlo ? ? I thought , Hot diggity dog ! " Chlo ? glanced at her husband as if he were a kind of toad , then looked back at Ben . " I wonder if you can guess what I thought when I first saw Lefty . " " Her friends thought she married me for my money , " said Lefty , shaking his head . " Boy ! " Chlo ? shrugged . " Boy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and this is my son , Dylan . " " Hello , Mrs. Floyd , " Dylan said , and stuck his hand out to shake . " Baxter , " said Chlo ? . " I kept my name . " " I 'm pleased to meet you , ma'am . " " Oh , do n't you ma'am me , " she said , getting to her feet . " You make me feel like I 'm fifty years old . " " Hey , Chlo , " Uncle Lefty said . " You are fifty years old . " She shook her head . " I am now , " she said , annoyed . Ben 's face twitched again . Dylan looked away from his father , embarrassed . A door opened at the far end of the camper and a girl Dylan 's age walked out . She looked like a less fermented version of her mother , with blonde hair and glasses . She wore a peasant skirt and a yellow sleeveless top . " This is my daughter , Allison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone . " Allison glowered at the men and muttered , " Hello to everyone . " She sat down in a chair next to the window and hid behind the curtain of her long hair . " She wants to go to Middlebury , " Chlo ? announced . " But I 'm telling her to keep her options open . " " Good school , Middlebury , " Ben said . " What are you interested in , Allison ? " Dylan said . She turned and regarded Dylan . It was as if she were looking at him through a telescope . " I write songs , " she said , and looked out the window again . Dylan felt the blood rushing to his face . He glanced around for something to look at other than Allison , and found nothing . " Where 'd you go to school , Chlo ? ? " Ben asked , hoping that she had gone somewhere . " Jarlsberg ? " she said . " Jarlsberg , " Ben said , trying to think of where this was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's in Oregon , " she explained . " You guys want to go to Jarlsberg , Chlo ? here can tell you all about it , " Lefty said . " Some wild times . " " Well , good , " said Ben . He studied the interior of the Winnebago with some desperation . " Boy , Lefty , this is quite a rig you 've got here . " " She 's a beaut , is n't she , " Lefty said proudly . " Fifty thousand dollars , used . This is her maiden voyage ! " " Me , I 'm a go to that Harvard , " Juddy said . " I thought we were going to rent a minivan , " Ben said softly . " That was the plan . " " This is better , " Lefty said . " Now we do n't have to rent motel rooms ! We can just stay on the ' Bago ! " At this moment a young man wearing a black turtleneck and a blue blazer stepped into the camper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is Polo . " " Polo MacNeil , " the young man said , surveying his fellow travelers . " Polo met Allison here at Flathead Art Work Camp , last summer , " said Lefty . " Polo , this is my brother Ben and his kid Dylan . " " Flinthead , " Allison said . " Polo here comes from New York City . " " Upper West Side , " Polo explained . " Central Park West and Seventy-second . The Majestic . " Dylan was n't sure what he meant by " the majestic , " but he nodded anyway . Polo , a good looking young man with curly blonde hair , walked over to Allison and put his arms around her . He kissed the girl . The others watched , then did n't . Dylan glowered at Polo . " You 're an artist , too , I guess , " he said . " A musician ? " " Myself ? " Polo said . " Not quite . My area of enthusiasm might more readily be described as poetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dylan nodded . He pretty much got the picture . " Well , I guess we 're all here then , " Lefty said . " You want a brewdog , Polo ? " Juddy said . He swung the ring of beers toward him . Polo looked surprised . " A " he said , then smiled painfully . " I think not . " " Well , here 's one , " Juddy said , unpeeling a Bud . " You can save it for later , like the little peckerwood here . " He looked at Dylan with regret . " Buncha goddamn squirrels , " he muttered . " Well , let 's throw this thing in gear , " Lefty said . " You guys find some bunks . Those first three are already claimed . The rest you can grab . Whatever . Hey , this thing sleeps ten ! We make some friends along the way we can just throw ' em on the pile ! " Ben and Dylan put their bags on a pair of bunk beds toward the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Ben lay down on his bunk and looked up at the ceiling . Dylan sat in a chair and looked out the window at New Haven . " Next stop , Yale University , " Lefty called . He blasted his horn and pulled out into the oncoming traffic . " Yale 's a good school , " Ben informed his son . " Me , " Juddy said . " I 'm a go to that Harvard . "
