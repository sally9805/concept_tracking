<p> FORT WORTH - The official headquarters of the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame is here , but the boots and chaps , the spurs and saddles - all of its memorabilia and much of its sentiment - remain in the West Texas town of Hereford . <p> Along with them are hurt feelings and disillusionment , fueled by the feeling that the 20-year-old organization 's old guard , its " " honorees " and its founder , Margaret Formby , have been given a cold shoulder by its wealthy new directors in Fort Worth . <p> Housed in a former residence on a side street in Hereford , for almost two decades the hall was the sole repository devoted exclusively to women who helped settle and form the culture of the American West . <p> Here the ropes of trick roper Joan Wells share space with platinum records of Patsy Cline . The chaps of cutting horse competitor Shelly Burmeister hang with indolence on a mannequin 's legs and a bronze statuette of Indian guide Sacajawea rests beneath a portrait of Fern Sawyer , a famed cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest in Blanco , Texas , in 1993 . In all , more than 100 women are represented in the museum and the archives hold biographies on more than 700 . <p> Moreover , the memories of " " Rhinestone Roundups , " the yearly induction ceremonies in Hereford when new " " honorees " would mingle with old , are still as fresh as the resentment over the move to Fort Worth . <p> That move was heralded as a saving stroke for the financially troubled hall when it was planned in 1994 . Directors say the hall had never been flush with cash and it had far outgrown Hereford 's ability to support it . Fort Worth , with the wealth of the Bass and Moncrief families and the Burnett-Tandy Foundation and opportunities for more exposure , appeared as the perfect solution . <p> A transition board was appointed , including the former members from Hereford and new blood from Fort Worth , including Kit Moncrief , wife of oilman Charles Moncrief ; Bill Boecker , a director of the Bass ' Sundance Corp. ; Carol Beech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Worth 's upper echelons . <p> Two years later , however , the library and archives are stored in Fort Worth , the displays are in Hereford , a new museum building in Fort Worth is still three years in the offing , and most of the organization 's former directors are all but disassociated from it . <p> Among them is Margaret Formby . Formby , a tiny woman with laugh-lines at her eyes , founded the group and nurtured it from a promotional part of the Hereford Rodeo to its own ceremony . She presided over its growth . <p> Under Formby 's hand , the " " Rhinestone Roundups " became anticipated events in Hereford . They occurred over a weekend , included an all-female rodeo and luncheon at which new inductees were introduced . Members traveled thousands of miles to attend . They stayed in $ 30-per-night motels , with Hereford residents who offered their homes , or slept in their trucks . <p> They competed in the rodeo and swapped stories with one another and Formby afterward . <p> There is no laughter when Formby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kind of like having a child and having to give that child up , then seeing the child treated in a manner that you do n't like , " she said . " " It 's sad . <p> " " But I 'm still optimistic . " <p> Plans for the hall were and are promising . Kit Moncrief , the new president of the group , said the board intends to construct a $ 5 million , 20,000-square-foot structure in the cultural district near the Kimbell Art Museum , with room for a 20,000-square-foot expansion in the future . Architect David Schwarz , who designed The Ballpark in Arlington , has been hired to draw the plans . <p> It will be 1999 before that building has a groundbreaking , however . In the meantime bad feeling has grown . It began when the Fort Worth group announced plans to house the museum in Mule Barn D at the stockyards , a structure that subsequently flooded . <p> Those plans were scrapped , but the Hereford group took affront anew when an archivist from Fort Worth arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them loaded on a truck and moved within 48 hours . More outrage followed when the Fort Worth group unveiled plans to move the memorabilia to a warehouse in Fort Worth until a new building was constructed . <p> Formby was noticeably absent from the most recent induction ceremony in Fort Worth in November , saying she preferred to travel with her husband . Former Vice President Hollis Klett has left that post with a few bitter words , and Sherry Delmarter , the former advisory board member and restaurant owner who catered the hall 's gatherings , says she is on the verge of suing the new board over " " contract infringement . " <p> There also are some disenchanted honorees . Those who attended the ceremony in Fort Worth in November stayed in the Worthington Hotel at the markedly reduced rate of $ 99-per-night , paid half of the $ 125-per-plate fee for a dinner at which the Bellamy Brothers sang and say they saw little of each other or the new president . <p> " " It was nice , but it sure was n't the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodeo clown and trick rider who was inducted in 1982 . " " I 'm afraid there are some of the older members on fixed incomes who did n't come because they simply could n't afford it . " One of those was Joan Wells , a trick roper from Lincoln , Neb. , who was inducted into the hall in 1989 . <p> " " I 'm afraid it 's gotten a little elitist , " said Wells . <p> " " Hereford was more down to earth . " <p> Delmarter and Klett , former vice president and still president of the hall 's for-profit corporation , are the most critical . <p> Both contend that Formby was " " shoved out " by the new directors . <p> " " What they did to Margaret was really a terrible thing , " said Klett . " " She got pushed out . <p> " " But the people who are going to suffer the most are the honorees . It 's been almost two years and there 's still no building . We had meeting after meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now they 're still three years away from having a building and I have doubts you 'll see anything happen in five years . <p> " " I think the whole organization stands a chance of going down the drain . " <p> Delmarter , a Fort Worth native who owns Cowgirl Hall of Fame restaurants in New York and Santa Fe and who catered all but the last induction ceremony , said the new group has dragged its feet on renewing her contract to use the name . She said she may sue in February when her old contract expires . <p> " " I was on the verge of opening a new restaurant in Nashville , but I 've had to put that on hold , " she said . " " They 're just waiting to push me out like they did Margaret . " <p> Formby expresses less acrimony . She said she opted to leave as president , though she remains in an honorary post . " " I knew how badly they wanted me to move on and I left and let them take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they would handle it differently . I thought they would be more interested in the honorees themselves . They 're what this is all about . <p> " " I do n't think the Fort Worth people quite understand that . " Formby had plans with the Western Academy of Women Artists , a group of about 70 from 16 states , to hold a joint benefit and exhibit in Fort Worth , but those plans were ignored by the new board . <p> Maria Sharylen , president of the group , confirmed that she had made the plans with Formby , but said she has not heard from anyone on the current board . <p> " " The show was supposed to be last winter , " she said . <p> Not everyone has doubts . Honoree Betty Solt , a Roswell , N.M. , barrel racer , and Georgia Mae Ericson , historian and board member , are both pleased with the new board and its plans . <p> " " I think this is just a case of seller 's remorse , " said Moncrief . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a top-notch museum and that simply takes time to raise the money . As far as the costs to the members to attend , we ( compensated ) as much as we could . We simply could n't afford more . <p> " " But I think the people from Hereford are going to be pleased in the end . " <p> Now , the hall has a potential competitor for its memorabilia : the Museum of the Women of the West that is planned in Boulder , Colo . Wells said she has taken two of her ropes from the Hereford display and may take other material if there is a further move to warehouse it .
