Section : COMBINATIONS <p> I 'VE NEVER SEEN A MOOR , but a healthy dose of Victorian romance novels in my early adolescence left me with a clear , if incorrect , impression that only the strong survived there  --  beautiful heroines and plants alike . My fenced-in , urban garden bears no resemblance to those dramatic moors , but the requirements for survival are similar . Plants here must withstand inexperienced gardeners , a modest growing season ( USDA Zone 6 ) , and cramped quarters . Two groups of plants that thrive in my garden despite these limitations , and that seem like denizens of the moor both for their coarse beauty and their hardiness , are junipers and grasses . <p> I ordered some blue rescues ( Festuca ovina var. glauca ) from a mail-order nursery three summers ago when my husband and I began turning a one-time parking lot into a garden . The three plants that arrived did not inspire confidence : pale , dry shoots poking out of crumpled plastic wrap . But they were worth all the attention I gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfying my desire for quick cover in a sparse border . <p> Because of their blue-gray color , I planted , them next to some similarly colored prostrate junipers ( Juniperus horizontalis Prince of Wales ' ) . My work as a graphic designer had taught me that there 's safety in a monochromatic palette , and the opposing shapes gave life to the composition . The grasses are upright and airy ; their seed heads shoot up in midsummer to a height of about 24 inches from a six-inch , pale , blue-gray mound that can only be described as hairy . The three junipers I interspersed with them added darkness and weight to the composition , the junipers ' denser horizontal habit balancing the vertical spikiness of the grasses . Contrast of shape , habit , and texture within one color range ( in this case blue ) is a way to preserve unity in a small planting while leaving the gardener plenty of opportunity to indulge at the nursery . <p> Three years later , the sight of my maturing blue-gray border ( which now includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , and several heathers as well ) still pleases me as I come out of my front door each morning . The tidy grass mounds combined with the coarse and sprawling junipers seem to have just the right amount of randomness . The blending of the light blue-gray foliage of the grasses with the darker blue-gray of the junipers works as well from a distance as it does at close range because of the pronounced contrast in the plants ' habits . Although the junipers have doubled in size since I planted them , the fescues have graciously accommodated the conifers ' encroaching branches by growing up through their periphery . This cozy arrangement may need some intervention next spring as the junipers take over an ever larger area , but I imagine it 's possible to prune them without destroying their natural shape . I can always take them out altogether . <p> ONE OF THE BEST ASPECTS of this combination is its nearly year-round interest . All through the fall the grasses and junipers remain pretty much unchanged , which is a gratifying state of affairs when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other ornamental grasses , blue fescue does n't look battered or change color dramatically as temperatures drop ; it simply keeps up a good face until the weight of the snow proves too much for it ( around here usually sometime in February ) . In fact , both grass and juniper are particularly beautiful with frost on them , which enhances the coolness of their color against other , greener plants . <p> Even inconsistent or unlucky gardeners can feel safe about trying this arrangement ; there are junipers and grasses that grow under even extreme conditions of climate and neglect . Festuca ovina var. glauca , for example , is hardy to Zone 4 and does well in poor soils . Fountain grass ( Pennisetum alopecuroides ) is one of the best perennial ornamental grasses , with narrow , graceful leaves arching two to three feet by August . When it sends up its perfect fountain of soft , copper-colored seed heads sometime around the middle of September , it gains aahs of admiration from passing neighbors , especially in combination with the so-called Waukegan juniper ( J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color in autumn that contrasts well with the green of the fountain grass in spring and summer and the pale gold it turns in the late fall and winter . These two fast-growing partners provide high drama , and they 're both hardy to Zone 4 , generally requiring little or no maintenance . In snow and slush country , fountain grass stays respectable until the ice storms of March finally bend the blades for good . The juniper , of course , is enjoyable through all four seasons . <p> Finally , a word needs to be said about mixing a somewhat trendy plant like an ornamental grass with the commonplace juniper , foot soldier of so many nondescript public plantings . When I began planting my garden , I was drawn to horizontal junipers because they work like groundcovers but make a starlike composition rather than a uniform texture . Some of my more fast-paced gardening friends sniffed at the introduction of such a pedestrian shrub into the same border as the newly rediscovered , elegant ornamental grasses . While there is something to be said for keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad idea to combine the new guys on the block with the comfortable old standards . <p> For sources of plants mentioned in this article , see page 66 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Combinations of Junipers and Grasses <p> By Leah Bird <p> <p> Leah Bird gardens in Cambridge , Massachusetts . This is her first article for Horticulture . <p>                     @x Mention Brazilian exports , and , for many people , coffee and orange juice still come to mind . But these days , " Made in Brazil " includes everything from Brahma beer and breast implants to Marco Polo buses and Embraer commuter jets . <p> In 2007 , Brazil 's total exports came to $159.2 billion an impressive figure but still relatively low compared to the country 's total potential . " We need to stop being only a raw-material exporter and become an exporter and importer of manufactured goods , " says Abraham Szajman , president of the Federation of Commerce of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't mean raw materials are still not crucial to the country 's success . " We are 6.5 billion people in the world , and everyone needs more minerals , steel , rice , soybeans , corn , petroleum , and ethanol , " Szajman said . " Therefore , third-world countries are getting a chance , especially the better-structured countries such as Brazil . We are ready to help . " <p> For this reason Fecomercio , which groups together 151 business organizations representing 600,000 companies , is working with APEX the government 's export promotion arm to strengthen trading relationships with Brazil 's former colonizer , Portugal , as well as with the Czech Republic , Poland , and other eastern European countries . Unlike China , Russia , and India , all of which are vast nations with serious internal ethnic and cultural differences , Szajman points out that " Brazil has only one culture , we speak only one language , there are no internal fights , and there is no separatism ... I have the option of investing in other countries , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Along with Fecomercio , another organization lobbying to boost exports is the seventy-year-old Confederao Industrial do Brasil ( CNI ) , which calls itself " the voice of Brazilian industry . " Among other things , CNI offers support to micro and small businesses , which account for 95 percent of Brazil 's manufacturing sector . CNI also promotes international missions and business roundtables with foreign companies all aimed at selling Brazilian products abroad . <p> " Our International Business Centers function as gateways to the world market for Brazilian companies , " says CNI 's president , Armando Monteiro Filho . " By utilizing advisory services supplied by professionals with proven experience in foreign trade , our companies can get to know the real business opportunities that await them in other countries . " <p> In that regard , two home-grown Brazilian companies stand out for their success in cracking the export market . The first is Silimed , Latin America 's only manufacturer of silicone breast implants , and the third-largest company of its kind in the world . Established in 1978 , the company initially imported silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a factory in Rio de Janeiro . One year later , it was already exporting to Argentina , and today its products are exported to over sixty countries . " It 's almost impossible to focus on the exterior and in Brazil at the same time . Brazil is very big and plastic surgery here is very dynamic , " says Silimed 's director , Margareth Figueiredo . <p> Using certified U.S. raw materials , Silimed makes breast implants along with facial , buttocks , and even testicular implants of silicone gel . Figueiredo said Silimed is the only silicone implant maker that stamps a serial number on each product , thus assuring 100 percent security in product traceability . It also uses the latest technology to ensure the reliability of its FDA-approved implants and a low rate of flaws in products that leave the factory even by international standards . <p> In 2007 , the company exported around 160,000 implant units , equivalent to 65 percent of total production . This , combined with domestic sales , would indicate revenues of $80-100 million . " We have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be constantly changing in order to keep up . " <p> The second company is Coteminas , headed by CEO Josu Gomes da Silva . The company , which began life in 1967 as a textile fabric manufacturer , has become the largest spinning/ weaving company in Brazil , converting raw cotton into yarn and fabrics for clothing and household items such as sheets , towels , and linen . Today , Coteminas oversees fifteen factories throughout Brazil , as well as one in Argentina . <p> In January 2006 , Coteminas merged with South Carolina based Springs Industries , pushing revenues up from $600 million to $2.5 billion . Gomes da Silva , who took over the family business in 2000 , said his company now has a 7.5 percent share of the world 's bedding and bath market . The Vanderbilt University business school graduate is also president of Brazil 's Association of Textile and Garment Industry ( ABIT ) . As such , he recently convinced the Brazilian government to pass legislation forging a compromise with Chinese textile exporters that had flooded the domestic market . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lasts only through 2009 and allows local companies a fighting chance to establish indigenous businesses without competition from Chinese imports . <p> " This is a bilateral agreement . It helps those sectors most endangered by huge increases in imports from China , " Gomes da Silva said recently . " It 's not permanent , but it gives the sectors of the Brazilian textile and clothing industry most affected by Chinese competition some time to grow . " <p> " It is clear that Brazil is ready to overcome this world turmoil " <p> Armando Monteiro Filho , President of CNI <p>
