When it comes to emptying the deep end of the pool , meat is murder // Not long ago my old friend A.K. Best and I were drinking coffee in the back room of a local fly shop in Lyons , Colorado . I ca n't imagine how , but pretty soon we were on the subject of fishing for big trout . Naturally , that led to some theorizing . A.K. got to thinking about fish sense , and about the day-many years ago now , on Thunder Bay River in Michigan-that his instinct finally kicked in . Coming upon a delicious-looking hole , he tied on a big streamer , nipped four split shot ahead of it on the leader and proceeded to dredge up an enormous brown trout . His first really big trout . " It just seemed like there should be a big trout in that hole , " he recalls , " though I ca n't say exactly what made it different from all the other holes . " A few years later , when the Department of Natural Resources stocked brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other locals took to following the trucks and stalking the schools . ( " They looked like weed beds , " he said , " but there were no weed beds . " ) A.K. eventually caught browns between 6 and 18 pounds on heavy fly rods and Keel Fly Stream.ers . When he finally moved west , he learned to pull 5- and 6-pound browns and cutthroats from the high mountain reservoirs . And not long ago he hauled a 71/2-pound rainbow from Colorado 's Frying Pan River-using a 71/2foot , 4-weight bamboo rod . Since A.K. is a professional fly tier and the author of three books on the subject , I thought he must have a flytying angle on big trout . " Not really , " he said . " 1 just tie flies to match the bugs . " " What about the chipmunk fly ? " I asked . " Oh yeah , " he said . " I forgot about that . " Back in the mid- ' ' 80s , A.K. and I stumbled onto a rainbow on the Henry 's Fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first saw it when it tried to eat a blackbird that had waded out to the end of a sweeper to pick Brown Drake duns from the surface . A.K. is a firm believer in matching the hatch , but he could n't quite come up with a blackbird fly , so he tied a large rodent pattern and dubbed it an " adult chipmunk . " It did n't work , but he had the right idea . While we were on the subject of throwing big flies for big fish , our friend Larry came in and said , " Yeah , I once found a four-pound bass that tried to eat a two-pound bass . It killed " em both . " And there are hundreds of stories like that one : the brown trout with the mink in its belly ; the giant cutthroat that ignores the fly but tries to eat the casting bubble . I think they 're more or less true-in spirit if not in fact-and they 're worth remembering if large is what you 're after . As A.K. said when the rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets pretty raw out here . " That rawness is what vou have to keep in mind . Most colossal trout-five pounds and up , say-have basically given up on the prettiness of dry flies in daylight . The flyfisher who wants to catch them with any regularity should probably do the same . It 's hard for any self-respecting fat boy to refuse a good crawdad pattern . Fish them on a sink-tip line with a short leader , on more or less open , sandy or gravelly bottom where the fish can see them , and you wo n't hang them up too often . Make the cast , wait until you know the sinking line and weighted fly are lying on the bottom , and then retrieve it with quick pulls and rests . Sculpins are big-headed , bottom-dwelling forage fish ( sometimes called bullheads in the West ) , and their imitations are classic flies for top-notch trout . They 're best fished with as much split shot as it takes to get them right on the bottom of a river-where you 'll no doubt lose some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jig , ideally while your buddy steers a Mackenzie boat through a nice deep hole . Trout do eat rodents-all kinds of trout , all kinds of rodents . Chapter and verse on mouselike flies dictates fishing them with a steady but not too vigorous swimming action . For example , a series of slow , short pulls or , better yet , a mid-speed hand-twist retrieve . Remember , they 're mice , not otters . They should usually be fished along the shoreline-where a mouse would most likely be-but there are always exceptions . A few years ago when A.K. and I were fishing some lakes in Labrador , we caught five- and six-pound brook trout , not to mention some pike , on lemming flies , of all things . Apparently it 's true what the locals say about lemmings knowing only one direction : If your camp is in their way , they 'll walk through it ; if a lake is in the way , they 'll swim it . The flies we used were somewhat smaller than the real critters-although they were the biggest we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind . ( But would larger flies on heavier rods have produced bigger fish ? That 's the kind of question I can lose sleep over. ) // Sculpin imitations are unbeatable for dredging big trout from deepwater holes and troughs . // Use a sink-tip line to put crayfish patterns on a sandy or gravelly bottom . Retrieve with quick pulls and pauses . // Flyfishermen have been known to agonize over fly patterns , and tiers working on large flies often make them very detailed , if only because they can . Naturally , there are conflicting theories . Some say a streamer fly tied to imitate a minnow or forage fish should be no more than a shape and a color-or maybe even just a shade : light or dark . Others believe in layering topping and tinsel to mimic the flash and translucence of a baitfish . Still others are convinced that predatory fish home in on the eyes of their prey , so they exaggerate that feature by gluing teddy bear eyeballs on their streamers . Ever since the Muddler Minnow was invented back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of spun deer hair or varn . There are dozens of variations now-from simple to complicated , with and without eyes-but the bullhead shape has been so effective over the years you ca n't argue with it . Few fly tiers can resist making their mouse flies a little too cute  --  sort of like cat toys on hooks . Most will admit that spun deer hair on a hook shank will get the job done , although they 'll also say little black noses and whiskers probably do n't hurt anything either . I 've seen crayfish patterns that were nothing more than two clumps of hair for the claws fastened to a fat yarn body , and others where you could count the tail segments and whiskers . Both kinds caught fish . In the long run , big-fish flies should be the right size and shape for the critter you 're trying to copy , and just in case it matters , maybe the right color , too . Beyond that , it should float if it 's a mouse or sink if it 's a crayfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have weedguards or be tied so the hooks ride up to keep them from fouling too often . The rest is up to the fisherman . All this stuff can work any time , but with the possible exception of sculpins this kind of chumming is usually best in the low light of early morning and late evening , and at night , when the big trout are more likely to feed . A.K. says he 's used all the tactics and patterns from time to time  --  and used all of them successfully no less  --  but that he 's not really a bigtrout fisherman . He likes to catch fish too much . There 's the rub : If you want to dedicate yourself to the biggest trout in the water , and if you go about fishing for them properly , you 'll probably catch some , but you wo n't catch many . That 's the trade-off . The top of the food chain is a lonely place . For that reason , A.K. does n't head-hunt very often . And because he taught me much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , we each have a box filled with big , hairy , god-awful , red-meat flies that we can drag out when we 've located a mammoth-or when we decide to put away the dry fly rods , string up the big sticks and stay out after dark . // Work a mouse fly through the slack water close to the bank . Use points of land to conceal yourself from pods of fish .
