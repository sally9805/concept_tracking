<p> POETIC <p> JUSTICE <p> Editor  --  In her long stride toward democracy and freedom , Croatia has been the victim of the most brutal and barbaric crimes since World War II  --  not to mention the crude and mean-spirited propaganda campaign that depicted today 's Croatia as nothing but a fascist and genocidal nation . <p> However , the truth and reason prevailed among world leaders and the Croatian struggle was recognized for what it really is  --  a war of independence . <p> After months of blaming everyone from the Free Masons , Germany , the Bulgarians , and even the Vatican , Serbian leaders are finally realizing that they have only themselves to blame for the fall of Yugoslavia . Now that accountability is the order of the day , the finger pointing has already begun . How encouraging . Even though this remorse and self- criticism is too little , too late for Croatia , perhaps bloodshed can be avoided in the other republics if Serbia and her apologists expend the same energies on housecleaning as they did on propaganda and war . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Croatia 's independence should fall on the birthday of the late Dr. Martin Luther King ; that Croatians after centuries of striving and the tyranny of Yugoslavia can proclaim , " Free at last , free at last , thank God Almighty , we are free at last . " <p> SENKA RADELJIC <p> Office of Croatian Affairs <p> South San Francisco <p> ' GERMANY 'S DREAM ' <p> Editor  --  It is not easy to find a peaceful way to stop the present bloodshed in Yugoslavia , especially when some countries like Germany are more interested in taking advantage of desperate situation in Yugoslavia for their personal gain . <p> Germany was too long idle . Now the great united Germany is feeling strong and its craving for expansion into the neighboring territories is at high peak . <p> Germany 's old dream to unite Austria , Croatia , Slovenia and Germany into a great empire with access to the Mediterranean Sea through Croatia and the Adriatic Sea is obvious . Germany 's arrogant attitude and manipulation of Croatia and Slovenia , combined with vicious propaganda attack and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Serbian people scared to death . <p> The fear is justified , because during World War II Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and fascist independent Croatia when thousands of Yugoslav people ( mostly Serbs ) were slaughtered . <p> As history has shown an unfortunate tendency to repeat itself , Serbs in Krajina decided to try to change the outcome this time . If Croatia can secede from Yugoslavia , Serbs in Krajina and other parts of Croatia have the right to secede from Croatia . <p> We Yugoslav , Serbian Americans are angry with Germany ! <p> God bless the United States of America and the new Yugoslavia ! Long live Democratic , freedom-loving Serbia ! <p> JELICA SORAK <p> Hercules <p> INSURANCE REFORM <p> Editor  --  The state 's continuing budget deficit and poor business climate do indeed make it unlikely that a comprehensive universal health insurance program will pass this year ( " Health Care Reform Gaining Sup porters , Chronicle , January 9 ) . I am hopeful , though , that the Legislature will make good on your prediction and pass an insurance underwriting reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insurance underwriting reform is an important step forward . My legislation now under consideration , AB 755 , would help bring insurance to about 3 million uninsured workers in California by making coverage more affordable and available for small businesses . The doubling and tripling of premiums some businesses have seen as a result of one employee 's illness would be prohibited , and people with pre-existing conditions or who are considered uninsurable would be protected . <p> The bill , AB 755 , would not cost taxpayers a cent , and it would provide immediate relief to nearly half of California 's uninsured population . It 's a step we can and should take now . <p> BEV HANSEN <p> Assemblywoman , Eighth District <p> MISOGYNIST SOCIETY <p> Editor  --  If half the fury and intolerance now being directed at welfare mothers were aimed at all the deadbeat fathers who fail to pay child support , we could significantly reduce our welfare rolls . <p> But then we might have to admit that women do not single-handedly produce children just to spite us ; that gender-based pay inequities leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families ; that the Bush administration 's obsession with outlawing abortion and cutting off funding to family planning clinics will only exacerbate an already desperate situation . <p> We might also have to admit that our predominantly male legislators do little to address the needs of women and children  --  and that we still live in a misogynist society , blaming women for everything , from sex and pregnancy to the breakdown of the family , from provoking acts of rape and violence to being stuck in endless cycles of poverty . <p> How will we treat needy women and children when abortion is banned and family planning clinics are closed due to inadequate funding ? Tune in next year . <p> SUZANNE E. KENNEY <p> Berkeley <p> CLASS-C CITY ? <p> Editor  --  Now that it appears the Giants will join innumerable large and small business enterprises and a healthy portion of the middle class in beating a retreat from the city and county , a short lesson in basic economics may be in order ( no charge ) . <p> In order to pay for AIDS expenses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire protection , there must be a tax base of some sort . You can only raise parking meters so much . The Giants , their concessionaires and ripple-effect business have produced a pretty good amount of tax revenue that will soon be gone . When your herd of tax cows gets down to one and you milk it 24 hours per day the cow will voluntarily turn herself in at the slaughterhouse . <p> It might be well to form a task force to fund a study group to run a feasibility program to lure the San Jose Giants farm club northward . Then there would be a Class-A ballclub in what is fast becoming a Class-C city . <p> WARREN SUGARMEN <p> Burlingame <p> LET THEM GO <p> Editor  --  As a native San Franciscan , I say who cares if the Giants move to San Jose ? The city got along fine long before they came out from New York and will get along just as well after they have left . <p> Baseball is a bore anyway .

If we as parents drive them underground and pretend that such people do not exist we are only kidding ourselves . Watching the television clip of their meeting made me realize that these men do not look like monsters  --  they probably have families , hold responsible jobs , perhaps even go to church . <p> I want them to continue to meet publicly so that we can see their faces and learn what their tactics are in abusing young male children . I want to prepare myself to protect my son and other children from these " monsters . " They are the enemy : let 's recognize their faces  --  perhaps they should be on milk cartons so parents and children can be on guard . <p> MELINDA McGEE <p> San Francisco <p> A CLEAN CITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our city the cleanest one in the U.S.A. The best way to have a clean city is for us all to pitch in , homeowners , renters , businesses each to their own block . <p> Let the city distribute orange bags and pick up the full ones . Establish a bus graffiti removal plan . Create an anti-graffiti informant award plan . Distribute bumper stickers and sell caps and T-shirts . San Francisco will be a great city once again . Step one is to make it the cleanest one . <p> THOMAS and DAVID N. PLANT <p> San Francisco <p> RATS ' ALLEY <p> Editor  --  After eleven years of Reagan-Bush " leadership , " these lines from T.S .
