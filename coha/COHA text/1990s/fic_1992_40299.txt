The pink vanity mirror in Anthony 's hand was like the one that enchanted princesses always have , the long-handled oval glass they consult to learn their fortunes . He was supposed to be using it to examine the back of his head ; instead , he was turning it this way and that , trying to get the big picture from the wall mirror behind him . Nuong , the owner of Shear Satisfaction , appeared in this panorama in her blue smock and black leggings , a plummy color on her lips , her own hair a flawless black helmet . Anthony was enthroned in her chair , encased in a robin's-egg-blue cone from which his head emerged in ruthless relief . The rest of him seemed not to be there . To his right and left other people sat beneath pastel capes , and their nether parts also seemed to have disappeared . That was the point . The head was what concerned the denizens of this place , only the head , and the reflected scene told you so instantly , the way fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror spoke with Nuong 's Vietnamese voice . Leave heart at home , it said . Matters of head handled here . <p> " Flying ! " said Nuong herself , lifting Anthony 's long hair and tossing it into the air . " Poof ! " she exclaimed at the penumbra of fluff that floated back to his shoulders . <p> " Flyaway , " Anthony said , helping her . " I have flyaway hair . " <p> " Flying away ! " Nuong affirmed , making her hands into birds flapping skyward . " Wispy ! No good ! Must cut ! " It was a time when formidable men wore ponytails  --  pigtails at the very least  --  but today , after ministering to Anthony 's hair for two years , Nuong was saying that his fine-textured tresses had become too thin to be worn in any kind of tail any longer . <p> She brought her pretty face close to his . " Fact of reality , Anything , " she said in commiseration ( that was how she pronounced his name ) , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " I cut this much , okay ! " <p> " That much , Nuong ! But that 's all there is ! " <p> " Not healthy ! " Nuong said . " Must go ! " she declared , and scissors magically appeared in her hand , their silver blades already lunging toward the definitive outward sign of Anthony 's remaining youth and hipness . He was an interesting , creative guy , a sound man for TV and films , but after Nuong was done , how would soulful single women know that ? How would those rare creatures tell him from the good corporate citizens gripping Cambridge and Boston like a chest infection <p> " Do n't do it ! " he cried out . <p> Nuong jumped back in surprise . Up and down the sweeping mural of the mirror , disembodied heads swiveled to look at him . <p> " Let me think about it for a minute , okay ? " <p> " Think ? " <p> " Yes , think , Nuong . Maybe , you know ... say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She laughed , and went off to check on a woman whose hair resembled , in its slick coat of red gel , the vital organs of a large animal . <p> Anthony looked into his pink hand mirror again . Nuong had his chair angled in such a way that he could see part of the street in the big mirror behind him . A college kid was skating across the four lanes of Mass . Ave . on Day-Glo-blue Rollerblades , wearing electric-camouflage harem pants and a red T-shirt barking MAKE ME WORK in big green letters . He was bullfighting the cars , dancing with them to whatever he had on his CD player , its wires going into his head . In the present epoch kids like this were Republicans  --  hard to believe , until you talked to them . This one would make a fascinating corpse when he finally screwed up , but until then he was having a wonderful time . What kind of corpse would Anthony make , he wondered . He was thirty-nine years old , and lately envied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today by a runaway truck , would his dying thought be " Why did n't I party more ? " <p> The kid leaped onto the sidewalk and coasted to the door of Shear Satisfaction . He was coming in for a haircut , or for something  --  " haircut " not really covering the situation on his head , which was dead-white and shoulder-length on the left , shoe-polish-black and buzzed to an inch or so on the right , with purple highlights like fake gorilla fur . The hieroglyphs carved into the black side were growing back . Maybe that was why he was here  --  to have his hieroglyphs repaired . Anthony lowered his mirror to check the kid out as he skated through the shop . The kid checked Anthony out too , with obvious contempt . <p> I was at Woodstock , dude ! Anthony said in his mind to the kid . That 's right ! Me ! The old guy having his tail chopped off ! I was there in the mud when it really happened , young cock ! Not like this jive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the street again . A black Alfa Romeo had parked in front of the shop . When the driver got out , a spear of ice entered Anthony 's heart . It was , unbelievably , a man named Robert , who 'd been Anthony 's best friend nearly a decade ago , until Anthony had started sleeping with Robert 's girlfriend , Sarah . <p> Anthony slid down in his chair and hid his face behind the mirror . He had to brace his arm against the chair to keep it from shaking . His day had finally come . After stealing Sarah from Robert , he 'd avoided his former friend , and not long after that Robert had left town . In all these years Anthony had never seen him again . <p> Nuong reappeared beside his chair . " Say good-bye yet ? " <p> He could n't remember what she was talking about . In Anthony 's six years with Sarah , Robert had rarely crossed his mind ; the knife he 'd put in his best friend 's back had somehow entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . But Sarah had left more than two years ago , and now Robert often popped into consciousness like a martyred saint , cloaked in the shimmering raiment of betrayal . <p> " We cut , yes " said Nuong , tugging on Anthony 's failing hair . <p> " Let me think a little more , Nuong . Please . " " Think more , Anything ? You think so much ! Maybe go home and think , okay ? " she said , reaching to unfasten his cape . <p> " No , Nuong ! Just another minute ! " he whispered as Robert , in the mirror behind him , made straight for his chair . He had a gorgeous head of wavy brown hair  --  had n't lost a strand in all these years . What was it like for Nuong to work with hair like that ? Would n't such hair be the Venetian light of her craft , her Stradivarius , the ultimate engagement of her special gifts ? Anthony saw that he 'd never been more than hackwork for her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Robert ran a hand through his flourishing locks . " Big meeting this afternoon , Nuong . Do I look okay ? " <p> " Need trim , " Nuong said . <p> " How soon till you 're done with this one ? " he said , and glanced into the big mirror where Anthony 's reflected face floated cameolike in an oval frame . Somewhere , someplace , Anthony had seen the smile that bloomed across Robert 's features now . <p> " Can it be ? " Robert said . " Is it possible " He put a finger on Anthony 's mirror and pushed it aside , as though setting back the hand of a clock . " Nuong ! Do you know who this is ? " <p> " It 's Anything , " she said . " You know Robert " she asked Anthony . <p> Yes , Anthony said , but no sound came out . Instead , the smile came to him : Orson Welles in The Third Man , toying with Joseph Cotten on the Ferris wheel . <p> Nuong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes , " Robert said . " Yes , indeed . I know Anything very well . " He crouched down and clapped his hand on Anthony 's knee through the barber 's cape . " Anything ! It 's so great to see you ! How have you been , old pal ? " <p> " Been all right , " Anthony said , sounding like a flying insect in a paper bag . His voice box had filled up with used motor oil . " And yourself ? " <p> " Oh , very well , " Robert said , imitating the sound Anthony was making . He straightened up . " Anything is a dear old friend of mine , Nuong . " <p> " Oh ! I never know ! " <p> Robert circumnavigated the barber chair . " You 've kept your long hair all this time , Anything , " he said . " You used to have so much more of it , though . You 're thinning out quite dramatically on top , old friend . I 'm sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . " He turned to Anthony 's stylist . " What do you think , Nuong ? " <p> " I tell him same thing ! " she said . <p> " Is Anything a Shear Satisfaction regular ? " Robert asked her . " A steady customer of our humble enterprise ? " <p> " Good customer , " she answered , nodding her head . <p> The sludge drained from Anthony 's vocal chords . " Our humble enterprise , " he repeated , looking back and forth between them . <p> Nuong smiled shyly and took Robert 's arm . " My husband , " she said . <p> A robin's-egg-blue barber 's cape is strangely like a force field from science fiction . Someone in charge must lift it from your body before you can move . Anthony sat without arms or the power to leave his chair , his head laid bare like a monkey offering its brains for supper . The monkey had it better . <p> Robert spoke to Nuong in a foreign language . <p> " You speak Vietnamese now ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam . I would n't bother to learn her tongue ! " <p> " It 's rude to speak a language when someone ca n't understand it . " <p> " Bad habit we have . " <p> " What were you saying ? " <p> " I was offering Nuong the male perspective on your situation . " <p> Perspective , Anthony thought , as Nuong gathered his hair in her hands . He 'd recently done the sound for a nature film , yet another documentary about eagles and hawks . The public appetite for predation was apparently insatiable . Like all such films , this one had been told from the predator 's point of view . But what about the point of view of the prey ? he wondered now . What about the rabbits and rodents into whose lives those raptors plummeted like hydrogen bombs ? Was n't their story interesting Was n't it noble ? So why did no one ever tell it ? He heard a metallic whisper behind him , like a closing door . When Robert stepped into view , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how recognizable it was , even apart from his head . Seeing his ponytail was like an out-of-body experience . It was he , but it was over there . " Put it back ! " he told Robert . <p> Robert chuckled through his teeth . " Wonderful , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " I said , I 'm afraid that wo n't be possible . " He started playing a rhythm against his palm with Anthony 's hair , the way a drummer brushes a snare . It seemed complex and Latin  --  a samba or a cha-cha . <p> Anthony raised his mirror to see the back of his head . He had the soup-bowl cut worn by deranged men in the street . <p> " Not finished ! " Nuong exclaimed , taking the mirror away . " Not to see yet ! " she said , and began her hypnotic lifting and snipping . <p> " So tell me , Anything , " Robert said after a moment . " How 's Sarah ? " <p> Anthony jerked his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything ! " Nuong cried . " Sorry ! Not move when cutting hair ! " She was nearly weeping with distress , frantically dabbing the side of Anthony 's head with a towel . <p> " Nuong , get some bandages from the back , " Robert said . <p> She ran off to do that . Robert folded the bloody towel into a pad , poured witch hazel on it , and put it against Anthony 's ear . It stung wickedly . " It 's nothing , " Robert said . " A scratch . Problem is , this part of the ear is a fairly vascular area . Unlike the lobe . Have you ever considered an earring , by the way ? " <p> " No . " <p> " It might offset the disadvantage on top . Hold this for me , will you ? " <p> Anthony held the towel against his ear . Slowly , lightly , Robert began massaging his shoulders . <p> " I have no idea how Sarah is , and you know it , " Anthony said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , amusement taking flight from his voice like the hawk that Anthony 's film crew had startled off its prey . The bunny remained on the ground , mauled but alive . " You and Sarah are n't together anymore ? When did that happen ? " <p> " Two years ago . " <p> " You stayed together that long ? " <p> " A second ago you were surprised we were n't together now . " <p> " Are you with somebody else ? " <p> " I have dates . " <p> " Dates ! " Robert seemed to marvel over the concept . " But no Ms. Right ? " <p> " Not yet , " Anthony said . At the moment he had a bad crush on an assistant director he 'd met doing a toothpaste commercial , a dirty-blonde from Santa Monica who wore denim shorts and hiking boots on the set and barked directions at everybody through a bullhorn . She could bark anything she wanted at Anthony , but all she 'd ever told him was to get his shadow out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all evidence of himself . In a perfect job , Anthony was the man who was n't there . <p> " So who left whom ? " Robert asked . <p> " It was n't that simple . " <p> " Nonsense , Anything . Of course it was . " <p> " She left me . " <p> " For another guy ? " <p> " As a matter of fact , yes . Happy now ? " <p> " On the contrary . I 'm sad . The leopard never changes her spots , does she ? " He massaged more deeply . " She 'd done that before , you know . " <p> " I know , Robert . " <p> Nuong returned with gauze and adhesive tape . She and her husband bandaged Anthony up . " You look like Van Gogh now , " Robert said when they were done . " Women will love that . " <p> Nuong spun Anthony around . His right ear was a big white nodule on his head . The right shoulder of his cape was spattered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert 's suit like the tassel on a Shriner 's fez . <p> " Why do n't you just stick a scissors in my throat and get it over with ? " he said . <p> Nuong backed away in alarm , but Robert strolled calmly around the chair , musing on his old lost friend , biting his lower lip reflectively . " The haircut 's too bourgeois , is n't it ? " <p> In protest , Anthony averted his face . His gaze fell on the kid with the skates . The kid was in one of the shampooing chairs at the rear of the shop , having his head prepped behind a portable room divider . All Anthony could see were the Rollerbladed feet and the freaky ballooning pants . The feet wiggled like giant tropical fish to the jive on his CD machine . <p> Robert saw Anthony looking and ambled over for a look himself ; then he returned , speaking more Vietnamese to Nuong . She answered with sounds like small birds escaping her mouth . They cackled like this for a minute  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nipping each other 's breasts . <p> This vignette of their coupling evoked one from Anthony 's life , an incident that occurred not long before Sarah broke up with him . He had come home late one night from a difficult shoot , and knocked over a table lamp as he entered their room . Sarah shot up in bed and screamed , " I feel like a big onion ! " and then fell back into deepest slumber . Anthony , who 'd been exhausted , lay awake half the night . He never mentioned the remark , but after she left , it became the crucial detail , the emblematic , haunting thing . What had it meant ? That her life with him was smelly ? That it made her cry ? That it consisted of layers ? Layers of what ? <p> " You like that ? " Robert asked , jutting his chin to indicate the kid . <p> " Do n't be absurd , " Anthony said . <p> " I did n't think so . " He stepped behind the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had relaxed Anthony , and now the relaxation climbed his spine and flowered in his head like fate or justice . He closed his eyes and sat still as Robert worked on his head with the clippers . With each buzzing pass of the tool , another extraneous onion layer fell away from his life . It felt good , like being loved by someone . <p> After a long time Robert spun Anthony around in the chair . " Voila , " he said . <p> Anthony opened his eyes . The rest of his hair was gone . In its place was a dark , lustrous nap-his under-fur shorn of the feeble growth it had struggled in vain to nourish . He touched it and felt a thrill . It was healthy and thick . He 'd forgotten the basic shape of his head ; now it bodied forth , all presence and strength , the cranium of a hero . Why had he walked around all these years with that dead straw hanging from his skull ? <p> The answer echoed back  --  because he 'd been fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples Robert had carved symbols , but not the chevrons and lightning bolts every teenager had . Instead , Anthony had mathematics  --  multiplication , subtraction , addition , division . He had equals and square root . He looked like a magician or a wizard from a book . If this was his punishment , it was n't good enough . His newness and mystery canceled out the sting of reproof . How could it be atonement if it did n't hurt <p> Nuong hovered nervously nearby , trying to assess Anthony 's mood . " Easy haircut to have , " she said hopefully . " Shampoo and go away . " <p> " He 's happy , Nuong , " Robert said . " He likes it . " <p> Anthony looked up into his old friend 's eyes . " Math was my best subject . " <p> " I know , Anything . You told me years ago , remember ? " <p> " I wonder why I never followed up on it . " <p> " Because you 're a deeply flawed person . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet . " Pay the lady , " Robert said . Anthony took another look at himself . It was like the old days on LSD , when you went to the bathroom at a party and your face melted in the medicine-cabinet mirror . " Can I ask you something ? " he said to Nuong . " The first time I came here , you told me your husband was a lawyer . That was the only reason I never asked you out . " He had discovered Nuong just after Sarah left . " You mean you were n't really married back then ? " <p> " I always marry Robert , " Nuong said . <p> Anthony turned to him . " You 're supposed to be a lawyer . " <p> " I am a lawyer , " Robert said . <p> " How the hell did you get into cutting hair ? " <p> " I just put up the money for the store . You 're the first hair I 've ever cut . " <p> The plush passenger seat of Robert 's Alfa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's lap Anthony rode , in a car that was magical compared with his own old wreck of a thing , the same yellow hatchback he 'd had eight years before . Coming out of Shear Satisfaction , Robert had seen the hatchback on the street and walked Anthony to it in disbelief . " How do you expect to get a new girlfriend driving a car like this ? " he 'd said , tapping the crumbling rocker panel with his toe . <p> " The type of woman I like does n't care about cars , " Anthony said . <p> " Oh . And what type is that ? " <p> " The alternative , nonmaterialistic type . " <p> Robert snorted gleefully . " There 's no such person , Anything ! Women love cars . Yes , your women from Cambridge with their Ph.D.s . When they get together by themselves , what do you think they talk about ? The kind of car a guy drives ! Why do you think they 're not making a commitment to you ? They 're waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered the Alfa out of Cambridge and toward Boston 's North End  --  Paul Revere 's neighborhood in the olden days , but for most of this century a small working model of Italy . They were going to Caffe Vittoria , scene of the crime of their friendship , as Anthony thought of it now , located right around the corner from the building where Robert and Sarah had lived . They 'd often hung out together there , the three of them . Robert claimed to have an appointment there today . Anthony had been back to the venerable cafe a few times in the past eight years , always against his better judgment , to make Sarah happy . She loved Caffe Vittoria , but it was the one place that twisted the knife in Anthony 's brain , dispelled his Robert-amnesia until he found himself staring at the door , convinced that his double-crossed friend was about to walk in  --  Robert , who did n't even live in Boston anymore but who could , like the monster in Frankenstein , materialize the instant Anthony stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a Presbyterian from flesh-colored Ohio , but his inner life had begun when he discovered the dusky peoples of Europe and the Levant . He adored everything about the North End , including its mistrust of anyone without an Italian name . Anthony , possessor of such a name , lived in Cambridge . He had always tried to acquaint his friend with the other side of the Old World , the noncharming side that screamed and beat you up and then smothered you after that . Robert only scolded him for failing to honor his heritage . <p> They were taking a route that Anthony did n't know  --  under the Expressway and down grubby streets across from the Boston Garden-and suddenly , before Anthony was ready , they were there . They parked and walked together up Hanover Street , aorta of the North End , past new espresso shops and restaurants Anthony did n't recognize . In the window of the world-famous Mike 's Pastry , where life itself had a sweet ricotta filling , he caught their reflection  --  a male fashion model escorting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casting were in a cluster on the curb , hats and pinkie rings and shouting mouths . They shouted at Robert , and he shouted back , and then they saw Anthony and fell ominously still . Out of the public eye , with Robert not around , they would have leaped on him like lions . Anthony knew this because he was virtually their son . But today they let him move on to the jewel of North End cafes , where he peered through the glass for a minute as though looking across time for his former self . Robert held the door and Anthony stepped inside . <p> A guy behind the counter was steaming milk for cappuccino , raising and lowering the metal pitcher with a flourish . Over his shoulder he saw Robert coming in . " Roberto ! " he called out . " Paisan ! " Then he saw Anthony and forgot what he was doing , and the hot milk foamed all over his hand . <p> " Nice haircut , huh , Rocco ? " Robert asked , buffing Anthony 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown nut . <p> Rocco gripped his scalded hand in a towel . " Yeah , real nice ! " he said , and his laughter was just like milk , the way it foamed out of him . <p> They walked on into the room . It was all the way it had always been , an Italian spaceship parked on a knoll above Boston Harbor . The golden tin ceiling spread like daybreak over the marble-topped tables . Gilded wrought-iron railings bordered stairs down to the dungeonlike basement room and up to the mezzanine , where spotlights shone on the painted diorama of a painfully blue harbor rimmed by mountains . Sinatra was singing " They Ca n't Take That Away From Me " on a fluid-filled jukebox that bubbled and pulsed through the color spectrum like a giant Lava lamp . He 'd been singing " I 've Got You Under My Skin " the last time Anthony was here ; he sang many songs in Caffe Vittoria . The jukebox was actually an urn containing Sinatra 's soul , along with the spiritual essence of Tony Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by a black-robed Cardinal Law in a frame on the wall . <p> Several tables on the main floor were empty , but Robert liked the mezzanine . Anthony opened the small menu and stared at the categories of drinks  --  the coffees , digestifs , grappas , and cognacs . " Paisan , huh ? " he said . <p> Robert poked him in the chest . " I 've been inducted . " <p> " Into what ? " <p> The inductee 's smile collapsed . " What do you mean , into what Into the Order of the Sons of Italy . " <p> " You 're kidding me . " <p> " No , Antonio , I am not . " <p> " How the hell did you manage that ? " <p> " I told you . I was inducted . The citizens of the North End have taken me to their breast . " <p> A waitress appeared at the table , a fortyish woman from a long line of Mediterranean forebears . Her hair was dyed a black not found in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Extreme though it was , hers still meant to convey the idea of human hair . " Grappa , " she said to Robert . <p> " Yes , Isabelle , thank you . And a Galliano for Antonio here . " <p> " I do n't drink sweet things like that , " Anthony said . <p> " He forgets , " Robert told Isabelle . " When his teeth were coming in , Dad would rub Galliano on his gums to ease the pain . " <p> Anthony looked up in surprise . " When did I tell you that ? " <p> " This was when he was a baby , " Robert added . <p> " Oh , good , " Isabelle said . " I thought you meant recently . " She turned to Anthony . " Got a tooth coming in today ? " <p> " No . I 'll have a beer . " <p> " In this hallowed place , Antonio ? " Robert said . " A beer ? Have a Galliano . For old times ' sake . For back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You two are brothers ? " Isabelle asked . " You do n't look anything like each other . Who takes after Dad ?

" She wiggled Anthony 's good ear . " You could use a little something here . Complete the look . Silver , maybe with a stone . " Then she slid her pencil behind her own ear and went away . <p> " That 's Isabelle , " Robert said . " Great lady . " <p> Anthony asked , " Did you meet Nuong because she cut your hair ? " <p> " Yeah , as a matter of fact I did . Is n't that great ? " <p> It was so great that it struck Anthony dumb . <p> " What 's the problem ? " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I 've always liked her a lot . I did n't like her much today , though . " <p> " Ha ! Perfect . You always were a fickle person . " <p> " I thought you always liked me . " <p> " I did , Antonio . I still do . That 's the point . I 'm the rational , consistent one . You 're the emotional loose hubcap . You 're the runaway truck . " <p> Anthony looked away . His eyes fell on Robert 's handsome jacket . " That 's an expensive suit , is n't it ? " he said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " You 've done well for yourself . The suits , the car , a store for your wife . " <p> " Most of my clients are prosperous people with a knack for major blunders . Those billable hours add right up . " He tickled the addition sign on Anthony 's head . <p> Down on the main floor a tall , gray-haired man called up to Robert . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jukebox with coin . <p> " Hi , Pasquale , " Robert said , waving back . " That 's Pasquale , " he told Anthony . <p> Pasquale pushed some buttons on the throbbing machine , and Sinatra 's " Witchcraft " began to play . <p> Anthony breathed deeply and said , " I 'm sorry I slept with Sarah . " <p> " You slept with her ? " Robert said . His lips twitched and fluttered on his face , independent of his other features . It was disturbing to see . Even Orson Welles did n't do that . " Were you tired ? " <p> " I 'm saying I 'm sorry , Robert . " <p> " Hey , can I ask you something ? I 'm just curious . Who seduced whom ? " <p> " She seduced me , I guess . " <p> " You guess ? I always had the impression that Sarah intimidated you , Antonio . In fact , I had the distinct idea that she scared you to death . It must have been something when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? " <p> Isabelle arrived with their drinks . Anthony was playing dead , hoping the bear would go away . Robert raised his glass in a toast and sipped his grappa . " It was over between Sarah and me before you slipped in , " he said . <p> " It was ? " <p> " Absolutely . Finished . Had been for some time . " <p> " I did n't know that , " Anthony said . " She never told me . " His hand was trembling , but he got the Galliano to his lips . <p> Robert winked . " I did n't say she knew . " <p> Once , this would have been the most fascinating information in the world . It was amazingly irrelevant now . <p> " Are you saying you 're not mad at me because I slept with her ? " <p> " Sarah was a woman , you were a man . Should I be mad at nature ? Besides , you behaved honorably toward Sarah . You practically married her , for God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear this , Robert . " <p> " Sure . Glad I could clear it up . One thing , though . You were not a man of honor with me , Antonio . Your closest friend . In relation to me , man to man , you behaved like a worm . No , you behaved lower than chat . What 's lower than worms ? " <p> " Slime , I guess , " Anthony said . <p> They fell silent in the blue light coming off the Amalfi Coast or whatever it was painted on the wall . Three or four tables away a man 's voice said , very slowly , " Your ... personality ... bums ... me ... out . " No one said anything back . When Anthony lifted his face to see who these people were , a beautiful woman was looking down at his head . <p> " Check out the man 's hair ! " she cried . <p> " Hello , Celeste , " Robert said . " You 're late . " <p> " I know , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celeste , this is Anything . Anything , Celeste . " <p> " Anything ! " she exclaimed . She was possibly the most exuberant person Anthony had ever met . " Really ? That 's great ! What a great name ! You mean , like ' Whatever ' ? ' All options open ' ? ' Total potential ' ? " <p> " Yeah , I guess , " Anthony said . <p> " He guesses ! " she said . " He does n't know ! " She pulled out a chair and sat down . " Why do I feel I 'm interrupting something ? " <p> " I 'm afraid I 've been giving Anything a little scolding , " Robert said . <p> " Welcome to the club , Anything , " Celeste said , slapping Anthony on the back . She was wearing a dazzling vest with colorful yarns and bits of metal woven into it . Also a white silk blouse , a tiny red skirt , and the translucent black stockings women never wore anymore . The world 's great religions could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs . <p> " So what time is it ? " she said , and reached for Robert 's Rolex . <p> He pulled his arm away and hexed her with his fingers .

" <p> " We were n't even here at three ourselves , " Anthony said . <p> " I know that , Anything . Do n't contradict me . I was allowing for Celeste 's affliction . " <p> " I ca n't wear watches , " she explained , showing her wrists , each bereft of any timekeeping device . " My body stops them . " <p> Anthony laughed . <p> " It 's not a joke , " Robert said .

If you were one of these people , they did n't even try to sell you a watch . It was n't gon na work , and that was that . " <p> " Well , then , it must not apply to battery-powered watches , " Anthony said . " Most watches today run on batteries . Just go get yourself one of those . " <p> " Nope , it applies to them , too . I even tried one of those calculator-watch combinations  --  the thin little businesscard type ? Got it to balance my checkbook with . The calculator part kept working , but the clock stopped dead . " She looked at Anthony 's wrist . " I could stop your watch right now . " <p> He took off his rubberized quartz chronograph , good to a hundred meters below the surface of the sea , and held it out by its strap . <p> " What did I just get finished saying ? " Robert said . <p> Celeste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . " <p> " That 's part of it ? " <p> " Sometimes . " <p> He fastened his watch to her wrist . If the jolt he got when he touched her skin did n't stop the thing , nothing ever would . He looked . The second hand was still going . <p> Celeste leaned back to look Anthony over . " So what kind of trouble are you in , Anything ? Besides wardrobe trouble , I mean . " <p> " Who said I was in any " <p> " You 're getting scolded by Roberto here . That means you 're in trouble . Big trouble , probably . Believe me , I know . So what did you do , snuff somebody ? " <p> " It was personal , " Robert said . " Anything is an old friend of mine . " <p> " Robert ! " she said . " You have an old friend like Anything and you never even mention him ! " <p> " He 's been away . He just got back . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pluto ? " <p> " The really funny thing , " Robert went on , " is that Nuong has been his stylist for years , and I did n't even know it . " <p> " I love stuff like that ! " Celeste exclaimed . She returned to Anthony 's head . " So what 's all this you got up here ? Addition ? Subtraction ? What 's this one ? " <p> " That 's infinity , " Robert said . " When did you drop out of school ? Kindergarten ? " <p> " Math was never my best subject . Wow , infinity , " she marveled , touching Anthony 's buzzed temple . She turned to Robert . " Nuong knows how to do all this ? That little slip of a thing ? What else does she know how to do ? " <p> Robert and Celeste laughed naughtily through their noses . <p> " Do n't worry about Nuong , " Anthony said . " She knows plenty . " <p> " I 'll bet , Anything , if she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs on her hut when she was growing up . She lived through that . " <p> Robert and Celeste sat there frozen for a moment . <p> " She grew up in an apartment building , " Robert said finally . <p> " Okay , we bombed her apartment building , " Anthony said . To Celeste he said , " Robert helped . " <p> " The hell I did . " <p> " I meant with my hair . " <p> " Oh , that . Yes , I did help with that . " <p> Celeste leaned close to Anthony on her elbows and traced his multiplication sign with a fingertip . " If you really , you know , liked a girl ... would you put her initials on your head ? " <p> " Of course he would , " Robert said . " The pity is , there 's no one special in his life right now . " He drew closer to Celeste . " Anything has recently undergone a terrible heartbreak . " <p> " Not that recently , " Anthony said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 'm so sorry , " Celeste said . She put her hand on Anthony 's hand . " A disappointment like that can make a person brittle . " <p> " I 'm not brittle . " <p> She laughed . " You 're reliving the goddamn war in Vietnam . " <p> Isabelle arrived to serve Celeste a drink she had n't ordered  --  Sambuca poured over three black espresso beans . <p> Celeste sipped this beverage . " I guess you 've been told you look like Vincent van Gogh . " <p> " He has , " Robert said . <p> " It 's a cruel look . Interesting , but cruel . " <p> " Anything in a nutshell . " <p> " He was n't a cruel person , though . I 've read up on this . He was a sweet guy who just happened to look cruel by accident . That was his tragedy . " <p> " He was insane , " Anthony said . <p> " So goes the rap . You believe whatever you read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think his paintings are , like , the epitome of everything . " <p> " There you have it , folks , " Robert said . <p> Celeste laughed and punched him in the chest . <p> " Let 's see your stuff , " he said . <p> She had an oversized black leather bag , which she hoisted to her lap and opened to produce a pile of fabric swatches  --  rich , colorful fabrics with exotic patterns woven into them . <p> " Celeste owns a wonderful boutique up the street , " Robert said . " I buy all my clothes from her . See these ? " he said , fingering the swatches . " These are the most choice fabrics "  --  he kissed his fingertips  --  " the newest weaves from the best Italian textile designers . You 'll never see these anywhere else in America . Celeste has a connection for these things . " <p> They were gorgeous fabrics ; even Anthony could see that . " Are you having a suit made ? " he asked Robert . <p> Celeste gaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these ? " She touched some of the pieces and turned to Robert . " Maybe he has something ? " <p> " No , he does not have something . These are fabrics for draperies and sofas , Anything . Nuong and I are redecorating Shear Satisfaction . Celeste 's helping us . " <p> " Oh , " Anthony said . He watched as they leafed through the samples . " The blue one 's my favorite , " he threw in after a while . <p> Celeste backhanded him in the biceps . " That 's my favorite too ! I was n't gon na tell him till the end , see what he said . " <p> " The blue 's nice , " Robert said . " A little bright . I tend to favor the grays . " <p> " Tell me , " Celeste said , smoothing Robert 's padded shoulder . " Everything 's gray with this guy , " she told Anthony . <p> " Roberto ! " a man 's voice called out . <p> At the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beckoning Robert with his arm . His pants seemed to defy gravity , staying up despite being worn far below whatever could be considered his waist . The men in Anthony 's family wore their pants this way too . Celeste looked to see who it was . The man winked and waved hello to her . Then he saw Anthony 's head and his smile disappeared . He squinted and craned his neck at their table . Anthony looked away . <p> " What are you doing with that goombah ? " Celeste asked Robert . <p> " Do n't say that around here ! " Anthony whispered . <p> " Oh , I know that guy , " she said . <p> Robert extricated himself from beneath the small cafe table . " Anthony , this is my man , " he said . " I got ta go . " <p> Anthony pointed to Celeste . " I thought this was your man . " <p> " Oh , thanks a lot , " Celeste said . " Anthony . " <p> " Give him a lift home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celeste 's cheek . He gave her a business envelope and shook Anthony 's hand . " Great to see you , pal . Call me , okay ? " He put the fabric samples under his arm and went down to meet the man . They walked to the front door and out to the street . <p> The envelope had a window through which Anthony saw his ponytail . Celeste put it in her bag without looking at it . <p> " Anthony , " she said again , and stroked his engraved temple once with her palm . " So that 's the name your mama gave you , huh ? Never suspecting you 'd do things like this to yourself . " <p> " Yeah , that 's the name she gave me . " <p> Celeste shook her head . " We go through so much for you bums . " <p> Contrition with women came easily to Anthony , because of the nuns . He hung his head the way he used to as an altar boy . He had an overwhelming urge to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you like to know something ? I went to Woodstock . " <p> She looked as though he 'd started speaking Vietnamese " <p> " The event . The thing . Woodstock . I was there . " <p> " You were there . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " And you feel I should know this . " <p> " I thought you might find it interesting . " <p> " You 're telling me you 're an older man . " <p> " No ! That 's not what I meant ! " <p> " Woodstock , " Celeste said . " I think I saw the movie . <p> Maybe I just dreamed I saw it . Hey ! You mean if I saw the movie Woodstock , you 'd be in there " <p> " I might be . I do n't know . I 've never seen it . " <p> " You were at the freaking thing , and you 've never seen the movie ? " She shook her head . " You 're a wonder , Anthony . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He told her his family name . It was a long , complicated one . His people were the only people in the whole United States with that particular name . <p> " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ! " Celeste said . " That 's gorgeous ! That 's your name ? You have to do something with that name , Anthony ! When you have a name like that you 're supposed to pass it on ! Give it to babies ! " <p> Anthony laughed . " You should talk to my mother . " <p> " Do n't say that , buster , ' cause I might . I might look up her number and give her a little report on you . " <p> Isabelle brought the bill . She and Celeste wiggled fingers at each other . <p> " You do n't have to give me a lift , " Anthony said . " I can get a cab . " <p> " I do n't mind . For some weird reason , I trust you . Are you from another planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You can tell me . I believe in that stuff . " <p> " I 'm not . " <p> " Well , I 'll still give you a lift . But it 'll have to be to my store , down the street . I do n't have a car . Wish I did . I love cars . You have a car ? " <p> " Yeah , but it 's in Cambridge . I 'll just get a taxi , thanks . " <p> " Oh , no , you got ta come back to my store . I want you to try a few things on . I have some new things I think would look great on you . This is n't a sales number . I just wan na see . You have the physique for nice clothes , Anthony . " <p> " Celeste , I 'm not really into stuff like Robert wears . " <p> " No , no , no , Anthony ! I 'm talking about clothes , fashionable clothes . The newest things from Milano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits He 's a ... suit , for God 's sake . The man is , like , so straight . I do what I can do , but he 's all business . ' Lighten up ! ' I tell Robert , but it does no good . He wo n't even wear , like , an adventurous tie . " <p> " Did you meet Robert because he shopped in your store ? " <p> " Not exactly . " <p> " You live here in the North End too , I guess ? " <p> " Do I live here in the North End ? I grew up across the street , Anthony . Hey , know what I have a VCR , and some eggplant parm in the fridge . Why do n't we rent Woodstock and see if we can find you in it ? Would n't that be a riot ? Plus , we 'd get to hear all that weird old music again . " <p> " I still like a lot of that music . " <p> " Oh , brother . Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tipping Isabelle handsomely , and they got up to leave . From the edge of the mezzanine he surveyed the ancient spectacle of Caffe Vittoria spread out below him . At this moment it captured the whole point of human life . Celeste 's arm appeared in front of his face . She was showing him her wrist . His watch had stopped  --  the second hand was not moving . <p> Her pleasure in this was a stunning thing . " Now you believe , " she said . <p> " Yes , I do , " Anthony answered , and he did , in something , though he was n't completely clear on what . " Hey , hold on , " he said . " I just had a thought . When a person such as yourself  --  " <p> " An afflicted person . " <p> " When an afflicted person gives a watch back to a person like me  --  " <p> " A normal person . " She snorted and cracked up . <p> He stared at her for a minute . " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and led him onto the stairs . " Who said I was giving it back ? " <p>
