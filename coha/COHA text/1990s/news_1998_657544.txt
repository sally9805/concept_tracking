<p> In Valentina Zefirova 's Moscow household , the economic crisis has trickled down to the family cat : Instead of canned pet food , Kesha now eats a more affordable homemade porridge . Japanese tax accountant Yuko Tsukamoto is cutting back on small luxuries . Korean bank manager Cheigh Chong Hwa stopped eating meat at lunch every day . Venezuelan hairdresser Marina Lugo has given up her car . Asia 's economic crisis , Russia 's spiral into financial and political upheaval , and President Clinton 's uncertain political future have rattled markets worldwide . The turbulence has Latin America teetering on the edge of recession . The international uncertainty has changed lives , bumping millions out of the middle class . As governments struggle with the big problems , vast numbers of people are figuring out how to cope with falling incomes and rising prices . Poverty is growing even within the world 's richest nations , according to a recent United Nations report that documents a widening gap between rich and poor . Mr. Cheigh could be speaking for many people in financially vulnerable countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts . " Certainly , Ms. Lugo the hairdresser would agree . Like many Venezuelans , she says she has slipped from a middle class that expanded in the ' 70s with the country 's oil boom . That boom left Venezuela heavily dependent on the caprices of global petroleum prices . And when Asia 's financial crisis set in a year ago , an ensuing economic slowdown sent the price of a barrel of oil south by about a third . It was n't long before Asia 's woes hit Lugo 's pocketbook . " I used to treat myself to an occasional lunch out , " she says wistfully , " but no more . Now I just bring in a little something from home . " Lugo says clipping locks for eight hours a day , six days a week - at $ 3.50 a head - barely gets her by . " For the same week 's worth of groceries it took about $ 45 to buy a year ago , now you need about $ 60 . " If she did n't have one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's not sure she 'd be able to keep her apartment . Such downward mobility is frightening to Lugo , but not new . Eight years ago she had a car , which was normal for a hard-working hair cutter in a country with subsidies that still gives Venezuelans some of the world 's cheapest gas . " But then in 1991 the car was breaking down and it was too expensive to keep up ... There was no question of getting another one , " Lugo says with a laugh , " so now I take public transit . " <p> Pink slips where there were none Cheigh , a manager at the Korea Development Bank ( KDB ) , has held onto his car , but often wonders if he 'll be able to say the same thing about his job . When Korea 's economic crisis exploded late last year , overleveraged banks emerged at the heart of a corrupt nexus . For years , businessmen bribed politicians to pressure the banks to support financially unsound projects . KDB is state-owned , thus safer than other banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where workers have been accustomed to lifetime employment . Bonuses and incentives totaling 20 percent of Cheigh 's pay have been cut . In the past year , more than one-third of Cheigh 's middle-aged colleagues have been dismissed . The uncertainty at work is compounded by the economy 's slide . " I own an apartment , but its value has dropped 30 to 40 percent , " he says . Cheigh 's response ? Work harder and make do with less . " Lunch is completely different . You used to never see people sit and eat 3,000 won ( $ 2.30 ) meals ... In the past ... I went to really fancy restaurants , and ate meat almost always . " At home , Cheigh 's wife teaches music to earn something extra . " Even before the crisis , my family lived economically . We did n't waste money on eating out . My kids do n't wear brand-name clothes . I only spent money when I had to . " <p> Sacrifices that affect the future Cheigh might be giving up meat at lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option to make that sacrifice would be a luxury . Between the passing of her husband 15 months ago and her country 's economic and political crises , Mrs. Soehardjono is finding , like many members of the middle class , that her income no longer covers the most basic needs . The price of rice has increased 600 percent since her husband 's death and government subsidies on all other staples , including sugar , flour , and cooking oil , have been removed . But more than anything , Soehardjono wants her two children to obtain the passport out of poverty in the developing world : " I am not so worried about the price of food . It is the education of the children I am most worried about , " Soehardjono says . Books , the school bus , and fees all add up . Her widow 's pension is less than half her husband 's salary , and she supplements that by working fulltime as a nurse for about $ 30 a month - the equivalent salary of a housemaid . Family and friends help out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible effect on daily life . " I am afraid of the demonstrations and rioting . If they attack and burn the shops in my area I will not be able to buy the things I need , " Soehardjono says . <p> Lack of security Japan 's unemployment is up , debt-laden companies and banks are on thin ice , but tax accountant Mrs. Tsukamoto can certainly buy the things she needs - she just does n't feel comfortable spending money now . " Things are really bad , " says the petite mother of two . Her husband 's construction firm is near bankruptcy - its shares have slid from $ 110 to 40 cents since the early 1990s . And their small four-bedroom house has lost 50 percent of its value since they bought it in 1988 . Tsukamoto and her husband are making short-term adjustments and longer-term plans . He will probably find another job after his retirement in five years - if his company lasts that long - and she has no plans to stop working either . " The only thing we can do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-to-day basis , Tsukamoto clips coupons and reads discount flyers . " I 've always been a careful shopper , " she says . She has stopped buying as many clothes , and she and her husband have also stopped taking vacations overseas . She says things will turn around in the long run , but the Tsukamotos are not taking any chances . They have taken their savings out of the bank and placed them in the government-backed postal-savings system - perhaps the most telling sign of their uncertainty . <p> Losing patience Russian housewife Mrs. Zefirova has already experienced the troubled times Tsukamoto worries about - more than once . So she was ready when economic trouble hit Russia once again . The first thing sacrificed was cat food . Next was meat for every dinner . Then Zefirova lost her hopes for a better Russia . Just a month ago , Zefirova considered herself comfortable . Her husband , Boris , had a car-repair business that earned $ 700 in a good month . They lived with their daughter in a two-bedroom apartment and had a country house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaulted . Prices for every consumer good soared . Her husband 's profits shrank threefold . Zefirova has lived through devaluations , crises , hyperinflation , shop shortages , hoarding , and food lines . She knew exactly what to do and made a list of what they could live without . " I stop wanting sausage as soon as I see the price - $ 6 for a kilo 2.2 pounds now . Coffee is over for me ; I ca n't afford it anymore . " The bleak Russian winter is approaching and Zefirova worries about how they will get by . Food supplies are diminishing in her freezer . They ca n't sell their car because Boris needs it for his job . They did sell a gold watch that belonged to Boris 's grandfather . " That watch had been passed down through the family , " Zefirova says sadly . Now they 're considering a cheaper apartment and selling the country house - if they can find buyers . Zefirova hopes to earn pocket money as a seamstress . She and her friends had hopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980s , we adapted easier because we were young and healthy . This crisis is more serious , because it is not the first or second , " Zefirova says . " People have lost a lot of resources , including their moral ones . They lost their money , their stores , and their patience . And patience is the most important one . "
