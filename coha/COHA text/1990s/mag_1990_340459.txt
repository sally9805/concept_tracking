It was true : that cancerous family of mine had every expectation that I 'd be a millionaire someday , or at the very least President of the Republic . <P>  --  Mario Vargas Llosa , <P> Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter <P> It 's at least 100 degrees in the noonday sun . Mario Vargas Llosa stands on an outdoor stage draped with sewn-together sheets pinned with red and white paper flowers . He is in Bagua , a dusty town in the north Peruvian jungle known more for its rice growing than for its literary sophistication . As the primarily Indian audience of several thousand watches , a partially toothless man wearing sunglasses and a pale blue guayabera hoarsely yells , " Mario , Presidente ! Mario , Presidente ! " Then the candidate speaks , promising , if he is elected this coming Sunday , to bring prosperity to the Amazonas province . " In this region , " he proclaims , " the future of Peru is hidden ! " As his words echo through the primitive loudspeakers , the crowd reacts enthusiastically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and controversial  --  writers doing running for President ? " Risking everything ! I would n't be doing this otherwise ! " Vargas Llosa says with a laugh . He is not exaggerating . Peru suffers from an inflation rate of nearly 3,000% a year . Ten people are killed daily in political violence in Peru , the majority by the Maoist terrorist group Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) . The average Peruvian 's standard of living has dropped more than 50% since 1985 . Corruption thrives in the bloated , inefficient state bureaucracy . Only Vargas Llosa seems to want the job of managing the nearly unmanageable country . Even for those who oppose him and his politics , which are supported by the country 's wealthy conservatives , Vargas Llosa remains the only reasonable option . <P> Vargas Llosa is not the most natural of candidates . In style , he is the exact opposite of incumbent Alan Garcia Perez , a fiery speaker whose high- profile antics wore thin as he ran the Peruvian economy into the ground . When Garcia tried in 1987 to nationalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has been in the limelight ever since . In fact , the handsome 54-year-old novelist is openly disdainful of the occupation that engages him . " Politics is intimately related to human mediocrity , " Vargas Llosa observes wryly . So far , this attitude has been to his advantage in Peru , where voters seem as cynical about those who govern them as he is . <P> The latest polls show Vargas Llosa with an estimated 44% of the vote , well ahead of the closest of his three opponents , Luis Alva Castro of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance . Because a candidate must attract 50% of the vote to win , a June runoff is likely . Vargas Llosa is expected to prevail , but once ensconced in the presidential palace in Lima he may look back upon his campaign days with longing . His party , Libertad , is one of three parties in the Democratic Front ( Fredemo )  --  an unruly coalition in the best of times  --  which is unlikely to win a majority in the national congress . " That for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " To win the election but not have the mandate to make clear and necessary reforms . "
