Madeleine Albright has never been the type to sit by her phone knitting , waiting for guys to call , unless the guy is the President and the date is with History . And so she was pleased last Tuesday when the phone rang and it was Clinton on the line . They talked for a while . He asked about the health of her friend Czech President Vaclav Havel , who has lung cancer . Clinton mused about the messy U.S. effort to unseat Boutros Boutros-Ghali . Then there came a pregnant pause . And then he thanked her and hung up . <P> When word spread , as it does , that the chronically coy President had called Albright , she started getting congratulatory messages from friends . Sheepishly , she had to tell them she had n't got the Call . It was n't until 48 hours later , early Thursday morning , that Clinton came on the line to ask her to be his next Secretary of State . And from that moment on , a friend says , she has been " walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary and predictable that Clinton would insist he had n't picked Albright because she is a woman , or because Hillary likes her , or because women 's groups keep reminding him that they did much to get him re-elected . So it was left to her friends and admirers to revel in the idea of a Secretary of State who sorted out the future of Bosnia while cuddling a grandchild on her lap , who knits and cooks and wears red suits and goes antiquing with Barbra Streisand , who keeps a miniature broom in her office sent by a critic who called her a witch for supporting sanctions on Saddam Hussein , who passed out bags of cookies decorated with hearts to members of the Security Council on Valentine 's Day . " I like this appointment better than anyone else , " says Jeane Kirkpatrick , Ronald Reagan 's U.N . ambassador . " This really represents a breakthrough . " <P> Clinton likes the appointment too , for lots of other reasons . In Albright he has found an iron-willed , deeply political , media-savvy advocate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to him than her muscular instincts and ability to talk like the popular professor she once was . When he was trying to make up his mind whom to choose , he kept recalling a conversation with Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski , who lobbied hard for Albright . A lot of diplomats may grasp the complexities of Bosnia , she told the President , but only Albright could explain why we were there in a way that Mikulski 's late mother the grocer could understand . <P> The first U.S. ambassador to the U.N . to have her own Website , Albright understands communication to the point that she calls CNN " the 16th member of the Security Council . " She also understands politics well enough to have so charmed Senate Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Jesse Helms that he was among the first to applaud her appointment . And she understands the world like a refugee , a multilingual , multicultural warrior for human rights and democratic principles . " At last , " says a former diplomat in the Reagan and Bush State Departments , borrowing from Albright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a Secretary of State with cojones. "
