OUR PEDAL-BY PEDAL EATING SCHEDULE FOR Jl SUCCESSFUL CENTURY BY JOHN HUGHES // staggered into the mini-mart , eyes glazed , hallucinating about cookies and caffeine . I was 75 miles into Colorado 's 100-mile Triple Bypass , a ride that crosses three high passes , and I had bonked big-time . But it was n't until that night , after I 'd had ample couch time to reflect , that I figured out how it had happened . My nutrition diary on the day of the event looked something like this : Skipped breakfast , ate two bagels while driving to the start . At the first rest stop I grabbed a banana to eat later because it was so crowded . At the second rest stop I bypassed the sports drink , filled my bottles with plain water and munched a couple of cookies . The third stop was at the base of 12,000-foot Loveland Pass . I do n't like to eat before a big climb , so I carried a couple of granola bars . Result : At the top I was exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suffice it to say : Lesson learned . THE RULE OF THUMB Do as I did and engrave this truism on your stem : On long rides , your pace is primarily determined by what you eat and drink , not by how much you 've trained . Because we have only enough fuel ( glycogen ) stored in our muscles to ride for a couple of hours , eating carbohydrates is vital . The other crucial element is H20 . Even the slightest dehydration can thicken the blood and take a progressively bigger bite out of your performance . PRACTICE EATING Like a good pedal stroke and a welltimed shift , eating right is a skill that needs practice-especially if you 're relying on it to carry you comfortably through 100 miles of riding . * Start each day with a balanced breakfast to refuel your muscles after your overnight fast . The old favorites are still a cyclist 's best choice : cereal , bagels , muffins , fruit , milk and yogurt. * To ensure energy for an after-work ride , eat a carbohydrate-rich lunch : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yogurt. * 1t dinner , replenish the fuel you 've used during the day . Cover your plate with vegetables and a large serving of pasta , rice , or potatoes . Meat ( or other protein source ) should be about the size of a deck of cards . * 1void alcohol , which dehydrates you and slows down the recovery process , making your training the next day less effective . And drink at least eight glasses of water a day . * Find out what the ride organizers will be serving at the rest stops . Do you like their sports drink and snacks ? If not , bring your own . * Practice eating and drinking during your training rides . Use cues-for instance , drink at the top of every small hill . Or go by your watch-drink every 10 minutes and eat every hour . THE WEEK BEFORE Start filling your tank well in advance . * Increase the amount of carbohydrates you eat to top off your glycogen stores . * Do n't eat more food-rather , increase the proportion of carbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and substitute another roll or more rice . * Drink a couple more glasses of water each day . Your body stores glycogen along with water , so you need the extra fluid . It 's good to gain a few poundsit 's merely stored water which you 'll use during the ride . THE DAY OF THE RIDE * Eat a good breakfast , just like during training . Get up early enough so you finish eating about two hours before the start . Drink several glasses of water . * During the ride , down a large ( 24ounce ) bottle of water plus 300 calories every hour . Regular consumption is the key . An energy bar is about 200 calories and half a bottle of sports drink is 100 calories , just to give you a benchmark . * Start the ride with two tall bike bottles ( 24 oz. or so each ) . Fill one with water and the other with a sports drink-a brand that you 're familiar with from training . If you ca n't stomach the rest-stop offerings , or you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the field first , pack your favorite drink powder , premeasured into baggies . A tall bike bottle of sports drink has 150-250 calories , depending on the brand . * Every 10 minutes drink either water or sports drink . At the end of the first hour , each bottle should be half full . At the end of the second hour , both bottles should be empty . If you have fluid in your bottles as you approach a rest stop , finish it up before you refill them . Take advantage of the freebies by refilling your bottles ( one water and one sports drink ) and replenishing your snack stash at every rest stop . Another rule of thumb : Always carry 400 calories ( two hours ' worth of snacks ) in your pocket . Examples of 200-calorie ( more or less ) snacks include one energy bar , four cookies , two energy gels , a sliced bagel with jam , two bananas or two granola bars . * One hour into the ride , eat the first snack . ( The snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll probably get to the first rest stop at hour two , where you should eat 200 calories . Keep the second snack just in case it takes longer than planned to reach the next rest stop . * Keep eating and drinking like clockwork and you 'll arrive at the finish pleasantly tired , not bonked-ready to ride again tomorrow . Which brings us to : POST-RIDE PIG-OUT * Plan to ride again the next day ? Then pay attention to what you eat in the two hours after the ride . This is the " glycogen window , " the period of time when your body is most receptive to restocking all that fuel you burned up while breaking your personal record . Studies also show that adding protein to the post-ride feed increases the amount of glycogen that gets stored . // <p>
