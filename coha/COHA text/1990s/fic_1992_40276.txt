The day before Thanksgiving the police found my truck . It had been stolen three days before from a lumberyard on South Broadway in Eureka , and then been driven east over the mountains and abandoned on a logging road outside Redding . I could n't imagine why anyone would want a rusted ' 79 Courier with ninety thousand on it , though it did have a 2.3 Ford engine . The policeman who took the report said a Courier 's an easy mark because the ignition switch is on the dash , not on the steering column . <p> I had to take a Greyhound to Redding . Towing the Courier to the impound garage cost eighty-five dollars , then another thirty-five a day for storage . If I did n't go right away , the truck would sit over the holiday weekend , and I did n't have the two fifty or three hundred it would cost on Monday . I could n't take the VW because Beth , my wife , was picking her mother up at the airport . I would n't take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Missing some hours with Beth 's mother would n't kill me . Edie stays in a motel but she spends most of her time sitting on the deck outside the Airstream , looking over the two acres of private clear-cut she helped us buy a couple of years ago . When we visit Edie at her condo down south she usually wears a calf-length skirt and pumps , a matching sweater and maybe a little makeup . When she stays with us she wears jeans , a San Diego Chargers sweatshirt , and red Reeboks that have looked new for ten years . She sits in a deck chair sipping gin and tonics and thumbing through catalogues she never orders from . <p> " You know , if this was a two-story trailer maybe we could see the bay . " This after her third drink , sitting out on the deck . <p> Dream houses are fine , but building them takes real money . Beth and I like what we 've got , and when the weather 's good , we sleep out on the deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with some of the last old-growth redwood you 'll ever find . <p> The bus was empty in Eureka so I took a window seat , and at the Arcata station I put my feet up on the aisle seat and closed my eyes . I could feel people stop and look , then move on to other seats . In my life , riding the bus means you were caught short . It means that for whatever reason , you 're not in charge , you 've lost a certain kind of freedom you get from a car , even a beater like my truck . <p> North on 101 , east on 299 , the bus climbed the ridge past the old highway from Blue Lake . Behind me was a young-sounding woman going to Weaverville , and another , probably a student , announced too loudly that she was meeting friends in Redding to drive to Seattle . <p> The Greyhound stopped in Willow Creek and picked up some Indians from Hoopa . I forgot to fake sleep and a black-haired man in a fatigue jacket took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat across the aisle and gestured to him to ask me to move . He put his head back , closed his eyes , and took both armrests , sinking turtlelike into his jacket . <p> I had on a red Gore-Tex windbreaker because I 'd searched the trailer but could n't find my leather flyer 's jacket with HURRICANE fading across the back in yellow letters . Now I remembered leaving it behind the seat in the Courier . <p> Rain in Weaverville . The bus driver unloaded packages from the luggage compartments for a blonde lady in cowboy boots . I got off the bus to use a phone , and through the open door of the phone booth the air came in cold and biting . My breath steamed . The operator at Eureka PD put me on hold . I 'd used up almost all my change by the time she returned . " I 'll have to find the officer who has that report , " she said . In the background another line rang . " A jacket , you said ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hold ? " <p> The line froze . I put in my last two nickels and cradled the phone on my shoulder so that I could rub my cold arms . This lady was sitting at a desk , with flat hair and a headset on , pads of paper in front of her and maybe racks of skewered notes , or one of those spinning things like in a diner . Case 429 , jacket . The line went dead and I hung up . <p> Outside town two Highway Patrol four-by-fours were pulled off at a turnout , but they had n't opened up the CHAINS REQUIRED signs yet . I needed to get back over 299 before the snow . <p> The bus rolled down toward I-5 , the fields and hills black and volcanic north toward Shasta and east to Lassen . Redding 's Greyhound had been a gas station once . A cab was parked in one of the mechanic 's bays ; I woke the driver and he took me across town to the impound yard . Gary 's Wreck &; Tow was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . <p> A young kid anxious to leave  --  it was four-thirty  --  searched the pockets of his blue overalls for a pen and then shifted from foot to foot while I looked over the papers he 'd handed me . <p> " There , " he said , pointing at the line that said Signature . His fingernail was traced black with grease . I signed , and we headed through the yard . <p> " We specialize in Fiats , " he told me . " We got more Fiats than anybody on I-5 . " <p> We walked through rows of small cars , all Fiats , stacked on top of one another . The thick smell of gear oil rose from the wet ground . <p> " More than Sacramento , more than Portland even , " he said . <p> My truck was inside a fenced-off area with half a dozen other impounds . Most had been involved in accidents . A few drops of rain fell , heavy , slapping on the oil-soaked mud . <p> " We ship parts anywhere , UPS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A phone rang over a loudspeaker and he hurried stiff-legged back toward the building . <p> Seattle . When Beth and I were young we stayed at an inn on Puget Sound . It rained all four days , but that was okay with us . We pushed the queen-size bed up to the window overlooking the creek that fed into the sound . Fresh from the shower , we lay on our stomachs and watched as river otters left the creek mouth for the cold water and fish of the sound . <p> I 'd met Beth at a party that week . " The Navy ? " she said . " You ? " She brushed the hair back from my face . " They 'd cut C 's around your ears . " <p> I was nineteen and restless when I told the Navy recruiter in Eureka I would sign if he 'd guarantee me the South Pacific and a chance to dive at Truk Lagoon . I 'd seen a slide show of the sunken Japanese fleet given by a local diver who ran excursions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unbroken china and the schools of fish darting among the bones of the dead soldiers . I wanted , undeniably , to know I 'd really been somewhere . <p> The party was in someone 's living room and the TV was tuned to National Geographic . A small man with a snorkel clutched the fluke of a swimming whale . Would n't you like to swim with the whales in Mexico ? Beth said . Would n't that be something ? She was restless in that room , shifting from one foot to the other , quick to catch pieces of other conversations . I felt her life about to move and everything she said or did  --  repeatedly glancing at her watch , the way she said The Navy ? , as if it was the easy way out  --  dared me to go with her . That night , because the moon was full , we drove to the beach and swam in the August ocean . When the Navy called I was on Puget Sound , watching otters . <p> " Mike , I forgot my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat on the bed , hard , the curve and small of her back making me want her . " But we 're probably safe , " she said . <p> We played cards in bed and drank a Greek wine called retsina that smelled like cut pine . When the trip was over I worried for weeks until Beth said it was okay . I thought we were going to take the world by storm and a child would be an obstacle to the kind of life that was in front of us . I imagined an entire winter on the Sea of Cortes , marked by the final days when , spring arriving and the whales gone back to the arctic , we would swim alone in the empty sea . <p> Beth worked in bulk grains at the co-op and I 'd gotten into fence-making , reconstructing period work for the Victorians in town that all seemed to be turning into doctors ' offices or suites for lawyers . In two years we saved enough to spend four good months in Mexico . Then Beth saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got it into her head to put our money into opening a video rental . <p> " I do n't want to live a life that needs vacations , " she told me . " I want us to always be in charge . " <p> I 'd lost several jobs to lower bidders and I was realizing that fence construction was n't much of a specialty , but I 'd been working hard and imagining the underwater photos of exotic sea creatures we could show our friends when we got back . This risk-everything attitude was something new in Beth , and it made me anxious . I started to wonder if she 'd ever be satisfied with anything . <p> " Two years , maybe three , " she said . " Then our lives will be our own . " <p> I did n't feel much like our lives were our own as I waited for the kid to find the impound-gate key on a ring full of unmarked keys . <p> Whoever stole the truck was a heavy smoker . The smell came out stale when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crammed with butts . I flipped the seat forward  --  no jacket . The rain fell heavier so I got in the truck , shut the door and rolled the passenger window down . The ignition switch was gone ; three thick wires hung below the dash . Two empty red cigarette packs were on the seat . Pall Malls , no filters . On the floor were six empty Colt 45 cans ; the plastic stringer was there too , folded , stretched , all the loops broken . <p> There were two thieves , the smoker on the right : the floor by the passenger 's seat was littered with burned wooden matches , and the windshield on that side was smoked in streaks where the matches were struck and lit . There was an oily touch to the glass and then a sulfur smell on my fingers . The driver had eaten Chee-tos and stuffed the bag under the seat . The Swiss Army knife and the tire gauge were gone from the glove compartment . I took a butt from the ashtray and held it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like to run , to leave one place behind and head for somewhere else ? They drove over 299 knowing the Courier 's locked gas cap meant they 'd have to steal again when the gas was gone . They must 've talked , because the radio had broken years ago when the heater leaked and flooded the dash . Their words were barely gone . I could almost reach them , feel their cut speech on the grip of the wheel . <p> An unlit match had worked itself partly under the seat back . I cleaned the lint off the blue-and-white tip and struck it next to the gray marks on the windshield . It flared yellow and eased some , the flame burning tear-shaped down the matchstick . Why did they go to Redding ? On the way to Sacramento , points south ? No . East , where California turns to Nevada , fades into Utah , and on . Sacramento , I-5 south , was too easy . I shook the match out before it burned my fingers . The kid was holding a split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hot-wire it , " he said , leaning in the passenger window . He tossed a roll of black electrical tape onto the seat . " The red one 's live . Tape the blue one to it  --  " <p> The ignition lights came on . <p> " Touch the black one to those and she 'll kick , " he told me . <p> The engine fired and whined high , the choke sticking the way it does sometimes in the cold . The kid held out his hand and I gave him back the tape . <p> It was five and nearly dark , as if the storm had taken the day out . I drove around town , the rain drumming on the roof of the Courier . I pulled into a gas station , realizing that to turn the Courier off I would have to unwrap the wires . The tape stuck to itself and finally the attendant sold me , for ten bucks , half a roll he found in a mechanic 's toolbox . There was a pay phone next to the candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Beth collect . I was n't sure how much I could tell her ; we had n't had an unguarded conversation for what suddenly seemed like a long time . In the past few years I had caught myself rehearsing how to put the simplest things , and what to leave out altogether . <p> Seven months after Beth and I opened Video Variety , Blockbuster came in a few blocks away with thousands and thousands of titles . They bought our stock at auction when we closed . We kept all the National Geographic specials and the Thin Man series , and for Christmas we gave Edie a Betamax with a handle on it so that she could take it with her wherever she might go . <p> The Sea of Cortes was still on the map , though it felt a little farther off . Three years later , after we had saved , again , all we could , a guy I knew from high school offered us a split in an all-night diner on 101 . A restaurant seemed like a safe bet ; everybody on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there 's always truckers on 101 . But we had no graveyard cook , so Beth and I took turns sleeping on a cot by the walk-in freezer . Five months after we opened , Todd , my high school buddy , was arrested for growing pot on some land he owned in Piercy . They put the cuffs on him while he was working the grill , and when Beth and I got there , the place was empty , the food cold on the plates . <p> This second failure made us quiet . We could 've gone to Mexico on a thousand , maybe fifteen hundred , dollars  --  anybody can save that much  --  but we could n't admit that we 'd lost our chance to be in charge . That was the big failure , and saving our change and scraping our way to Mexico was n't going to erase the damage we 'd done . <p> We went on with our lives . Beth got us on a swimming kick at the community pool . She taped the schedule on the refrigerator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten laps a day , then twenty-five , and before long we were doing forty like we 'd been born in the water . It was good for us , and healthy , but there was something serious in it for Beth . I was back to making fences , and I worked my schedule so I would n't miss our daily swim unless I really had to . <p> One Saturday afternoon I watched a group of children taking lessons in the shallow end . I picked out a blonde girl I named Gina , following her from the paddleboard kicks that frothed up the water to her first strokes at the crawl . One of her parents knelt by the pool , waiting with a Bart Simpson beach towel . What a nice way to focus your life . You could put your mind to raising a child , and maybe your mistakes could get put to use in a constructive way . I did n't say anything about mistakes to Beth , just said it straight out : a kid would be nice . <p> " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midpool . Beth adjusted her goggles . She looked over to where Gina 's class was swimming tiny laps in the shallow end . <p> " Which one do you want ? " she said . <p> " Beth . I 'm serious . " <p> She slapped some water at me and swam off . I held my breath and swam under her , tickling and teasing her legs , listening to the sound of her laughing underwater . <p> After three months of trying to have a kid Beth pulled up one day in the shallow end of the pool . I stopped next to her , crouched low in the water . <p> " It 's not going to happen , " she said . She brushed the wet hair from my face . <p> " What ? " I looked past her to a class of children practicing floating , their cheeks round with air . <p> " We 're not going to have a child . " The tone in her voice told me we 'd bottomed out again , and it was like shooting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll just try harder , " I said . <p> Beth grabbed my shoulders . " I went to the clinic , " she said . Water dripped from her face . " It 's not going to happen . " <p> I pulled Beth to me and caught something in her face , a coldness , a look from a stranger who needed to move on . But she smiled and came back . <p> " What now ? " I said . <p> " What else ? " Beth said , squeezing my hand . " Do more laps . " <p> A few days later Edie gave us the money for the land and the trailer , supposedly as an investment . I know she was trying to get our minds off everything that had n't worked out , and I have to admire her for it . She 's always telling me I should get a couple of goats , and I say I 'll look into that . Beth never said another thing about having a child , and I have n't brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short straws and nothing we could say would change anything . I would 've swore I knew her inside and out , but now when she 's quiet , a little sullen , I get resentful at her leaving me so alone . <p> In the gas-station office I waited while the operator made the connection . Outside , the Redding sky was jammed with blackening clouds driven east by the wind . Beth and Edie would be inside the trailer now , sitting at the built-in Formica table , shaking up the lettered dice of a word game and keeping an eye on the tiny hourglass timer . If I were there , I would excuse myself and go out on the deck , breathing the cold air and looking up at the stars in the night sky , feeling trapped by my strange family , but also feeling responsible to them , never quite able not to love some part of what went on . Shadows bigger than life would press against the trailer 's windows , and Edie would tell Beth she ca n't use x-ray without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police been calling , " she said . Her voice changed when she drank , her 1 's seeming to fill her mouth . The plastic bottles of tonic would be going flat by the small stainless sink , and if Edie had been mixing , the top would be off the gin  --  kill any germs get in there , she often said . <p> " They have somebody there in jail , " Beth said . " They want you to go by . " <p> " Great , " I said . " Now I have to go to the jail ? " <p> Beth laughed . " You 'll get time off for good behavior . " <p> I felt Edie sitting there , and I could hear rain on the roof of the Airstream . Outside the overhang of the station it was really coming down . On the wall next to the phone was a map of Redding ; I traced my finger along 299 toward Eureka , letting myself get angry at Beth and her witty remarks . Then I touched I-5 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was already away from Thanksgiving . I had enough money for one more tank of gas ; I could drive the truck dry , hitchhike , and if nothing bad happened , I 'd be there in two , maybe three , days . I could swim alone in the Sea of Cortes . I could leave Beth to the trailer and Edie , to no money and no everything else . I held my finger on the map , knowing that thinking about running was as bad as doing it . <p> " We need to talk , " I said . <p> " Talk ? " Beth said . <p> A car pulled up to the pumps , its tires sucking at the wet pavement . " Are you happy ? " I asked . I had her at a disadvantage  --  she was a little drunk , and Edie was there in the room . It was an edge that boosted my courage but at the same time made me feel small . <p> " Happy  --  ? " She muffled the phone but I could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deck . " Why are you asking , Mike ? " <p> " Just a little curious , I guess . " <p> I heard the ice in the glass up next to the phone . " You know , " Beth said , " I 'd have to think about that . " <p> " What 's there to think about " <p> She laughed . " Silly word . Happy . " <p> " Nothing silly about it . " <p> " Hey , " she said . " Mike . What 's going on over there ? Why you going at me like this ? " <p> The air was cold enough that I could see my breath , but my hand was sweaty on the phone and my heart was jumping . <p> " I 'm tired of feeling sorry for us , " I said . <p> Beth took in a quick breath , like someone spit ice water down her back . " Okay , " she said . " Feel good and sorry . Sorry for yourself . " <p> A semi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant ring some money into the register . What was I doing ! This was Beth I was talking to . She was a good person who 'd never gotten the good breaks . Where did I come off hurting her feelings , long distance , on Thanksgiving ? <p> " Beth , " I said , imagining her face in the sound of her name . " I miss you . I was driving around here thinking how we have a pretty good life if you look at it . " <p> " You were driving around feeling sorry for us . " <p> I snapped my finger on the blue line of I-5 and a spider dropped down from behind the map . " That 's not what I meant . " <p> " But that 's what you said . " <p> " I 'm tired , " I said . The air was getting colder and I wished I had my flyer 's jacket . <p> " Do n't come back here if you 're feeling sorry  --  " <p> " Come on , Beth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a gas station , freezing . " <p> For a while there was only line noise : me at a pay phone in Redding , and Beth sitting around back home . <p> " You should see the truck , " I finally said . <p> " We ca n't afford to fix it , " she said . <p> I breathed easier . We were getting back to normal . <p> " Do you know about the road ? " she asked . <p> " Probably it 's still open . " <p> I thought she put the phone to her other ear . " Okay , " she said . " Mike " <p> " Yeah ? " " Are you happy " <p> The spider worked its way back up behind the map . I palmed it flat between the map and the wall . " Sure , " I said . " Except for being in Redding in a truck I have to start with pieces of tape . Sure , " I told her . " Of course I 'm happy . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " You bet . " <p> The trailer door slammed shut again . <p> " You want to say hi to my mother ? " <p> " Sorry , but I 'm off to jail . " <p> She laughed a sweet laugh , the one that always meant I 'd pulled her out of it for now . <p> At the police station a detective named Holman led me through a steel gate and down a corridor lined with shut doors . He wore Levi 's , cowboy boots , and a black silk Raiders jacket . He was to young to be as bored as he was . <p> " Dispatcher in Eureka called , said something about a coat  --  " He turned on his heel and raised his eyebrows . <p> " Right ? " <p> I nodded . <p> Holman walked again . " What do you do ? " <p> " I 'm sorry ? " <p> " In Eureka . What do you do ? " <p> " Oh , " I said . " Fences . Decorative fences . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorians . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> We stopped by a door with a clipboard hanging on it . He took the clipboard and flipped through some paperwork . The silver Raiders ' emblem on Holman 's jacket was the hard-lined face of a man in a football helmet , a patch over one eye . <p> " Are you from Oakland ? " I asked . <p> He looked at me over the clipboard . " Yeah , " he lied . <p> I rolled another wooden match from the Courier between my fingers . He opened the door into a small room and went in before me . He left the lights off . <p> " Suspect was picked up shoplifting cigarettes , several blocks away from the site of another truck theft . Her partner must 've run when he saw the black-and-white . " Holman leaned against the wall next to the window , the mirror . <p> " Just like the movies , " he said . " She ca n't see you . " <p> The woman was five-four maybe , in broken-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue T-shirt covered by a torn yellow one with a tractor graphic and the words SELL IT IN THE ATHENS GAZETTE . Her hair fell just below her shoulders ; her face was lined , unsmiling , practiced in waiting . She stood in a corner , looking at an unopened pack of Pall Malls on a gray table . My jacket was inside out , thrown across the back of one of two chairs . <p> " Carter , Lilian , " Holman said . " Twenty-eight . Bozeman , Montana . Lot of small time here . Been running since she was nineteen from one thing or another . " He tapped a pen on the clipboard . <p> Northeast . She was going home . <p> " Get her to model that jacket for you . " Holman stepped out . <p> Lilian Carter stiffened as the door opened and Holman appeared . He spoke to her . When she did n't move , I could see him say Come on , Lily . She took the jacket from the back of the chair and pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Holman twirled a finger and she turned around . HURRICANE . She stepped up and faced the mirror , took a comb from inside the jacket and picked her thumb down the teeth , then in even strokes ran it through her hair  --  it was her way to be angry . She looked calm but she worked the comb hard , and when it snagged her mouth tightened a little . Her eyes were gray and quick to follow Holman when he moved behind her . <p> She tapped on the mirror with the comb . My neck got hot and sweat came to my palms . She watched the mirror , daring me . I pulled my key ring from my pocket and ticked the key to the Courier against the glass . She smiled , and then her mouth hardened when Holman spoke to her . She sat and he left , taking the unopened pack of cigarettes with him . <p> " Well ? " Holman said , back in the room . He tossed the cigarettes in a small gray trash can . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't worth it . " <p> On a frozen road somewhere , snow blowing , I saw Lilian Carter lighting another Pall Mall , the jacket pulled tight around her . My life of small failure had led me here , to finger someone caught trying to go home . <p> " It 's not mine , " I said . <p> " What ? " There was contempt in Holman 's voice . <p> " That 's not my jacket , " I told him again . <p> " Jesus , " Holman said . <p> Outside the storm had let up some . The rain was windblown , cold , scattering in bursts across the black streets . Tired , I circled back through town a couple of times and found an open diner near the freeway on-ramp . I was still playing with the idea of heading south , but it was make-believe now , just part of a story I was telling myself . I parked away from the diner 's entrance , near a streetlight , so it would be easier to see the ignition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinder-block building with a beam ceiling laced with cobwebs . By the door was a topographic map showing the lava paths from Shasta , and above the cash register a small chalkboard listed a turkey dinner for six dollars . The place was nearly empty , all the lights over the booths turned off , so I took a seat down the counter from a truck driver . I did n't have anything new to say to Beth , but I wanted to reassure her and hear her voice again . I got a cup of coffee and the waitress gave me quarters for two dollars and told me the phone was by the rest rooms . I did n't want to call collect . <p> The line was slow and took all my change . While I waited for the ring Lilian Carter came out of the women 's room , punched a button on the cigarette machine and walked past me into the restaurant . I hung up and my money rattled into the coin return . She walked down the counter , past my coffee , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started talking , gesturing with big hands . I took my money from the phone and sat back down at the counter . <p> " This weather 's nothing , " he said , shaking his head . He took a pack of Marlboros out of his coat and held the cigarettes out . " Diane , right ? " <p> Lilian Carter nodded , took a cigarette and lit it quickly with the truck driver 's lighter . <p> " I got to make a call . " The truck driver pushed himself away from the counter and went for the phone . <p> She drew hard on the cigarette , flicked the ash on the floor , then slid his coffee cup in front of her and took a french fry off his finished plate . <p> I rattled the change in my pocket . Enough for cigarettes  --  Pall Malls . At the phone the truck driver dialed . I went past him and dropped my quarters into the machine . <p> " Hey , it 's me , " the truck driver said . He put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , maybe not tonight . This damned weather  --  " <p> Lilian Carter was fingering another cigarette from the pack on the counter when I took my seat again . I set the Pall Malls in front of me and sipped my coffee . She moved over , taking the seat two down from me . <p> " You got a spare cigarette ? " she asked me . " I ca n't stand these . " She broke the Marlboro in half . The leather of the jacket creaked when she moved . <p> " Go ahead , " I said , and slid the cigarettes toward her . She opened the pack , lit one and picked a grain of tobacco from her lip , then exhaled a long stream of smoke across the counter . <p> " Thanks , " she said . " Which way you going ? " <p> " East . " I put more cream in my coffee and stirred it , spilling a little . I did n't want to look at her . I was ashamed for hearing the truck driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have bought on my own , for telling her east instead of the truth . <p> She reached and took the spoon from my hand . " You okay ? " <p> " Me ? " I said . <p> " Yeah . You nervous ? " <p> The cook erased the Thanksgiving special from the chalkboard and took his apron off . <p> " I 'm all right . I 'm fine . " <p> Lilian Carter laughed a little . " Nobody here is fine . " She licked the spoon and set it on the counter . " Too bad you 're not going south . " <p> " South ? " I said . She looked at me . " Yeah . Sacramento . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Somebody there owes me money . " She pointed over her shoulder . " Romeo here 's going to San Diego .

" You got a home ? " <p> She caught me off guard and I felt insulted , as if she should 've showed me some gratitude , some respect ; but then all she knew about me was the cigarettes she had in her hand . I shifted in my seat . " A wife  --  " I said . " And a little girl , Gina , six  --  " <p> The words were too simple and they brought my eyes down to the counter . But it was my story , still .

In the parking lot gusts of wind blew rain across the streetlights . I stood under the cafe 's eaves , looking at the Courier and breathing the cold air . I was wishing I had n't stopped , that I had headed back right away . I wanted to tell Beth about the Chee-tos bag , the cigarettes , the wide-open way it all made me feel . But it was another Beth I wanted , the one I 'd known at Lilian Carter 's age , the one who would 've sat up with me all night making up stories about the thieves . The one I could 've said I 'm happy to and meant it . <p> Lilian stepped out while I was leaning against the Courier , going through my pockets for the tape .

I waited for something to say , something to tell her , but I was too far away and the rain was coming down hard . I needed to hit on something , still . Something I could tell myself . <p> In the distance traffic moved on I-5 , the sound reaching through the wind in pieces . <p> My fingers curled around the roll of tape in my pocket . " I lied , " I said into the rain . <p>
