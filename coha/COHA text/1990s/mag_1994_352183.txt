Politicians do penance in places like Harlem and the South Bronx . They tour and deplore and promise , and very little ever changes . Last week it was Bill Clinton 's turn . At a church in Harlem across the street from an abandoned building and down the block from a crack house , the master of empathy was strangely subdued . Perhaps because so much of his agenda is perceived of as dead or dying , the staple of such appearances , a litany of Administration accomplishments , was largely truncated . There was a bit of boasting ( " We 've done more in 20 months than anybody has in a month of Sundays " ) , but Clinton 's overall tone was plaintive . " One of the things I ran for President about , " he said , setting a rather minimalist goal for an activist leader , " was just to get us to face our problems again . . . and go to work on them instead of just talking about them all the time . " <P> Given his muted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already beginning to feel the effects of his presidency , a definite , substantive change in direction as , however incrementally , Clinton refocuses government spending and moves to implement proposals that have languished for decades . <P> Along Harlem 's main thoroughfare , 125th Street , business is booming , a function of indigenous forces mostly but of Clinton 's policies as well . The vacancy rate for commercial property is less than 2% , and space is renting for more than $30 per sq . ft. , about the same as in midtown Manhattan , an astounding surge . New stores will soon dot the cross streets , and nearby housing units are being rehabilitated . The private investment responsible for most of this growth is following rising incomes and the return of better-off families . Perhaps most important is the anticipated designation of the area as one of the nation 's first six empowerment zones . " EZs , " as they are known , are the latest incarnation of an old idea formerly called enterprise zones .

After the Harlem-South Bronx EZ is formally approved later this year , the Federal Government will pour $100 million into the area , an amount New York City and State will match . Added to the total $300 million will be about $70 million in low-interest loans from Fleet Bank . " Only some corporations see the opportunities available , " says Fleet 's James Murphy . " Others will wake up before long and leverage the thing further . Harlem 's coming back , and the EZ deserves a lot of the credit . " <P> Coming back and being back are different , of course . Harlem 's depression is still staggering . Single female-headed households account for 63% of all households with children . Forty-two percent of the population has an income below the poverty line . Black men living in Harlem are less likely to reach age 65 than men in Bangladesh . The murder rate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's over 100 . The area 's infant-mortality rate is 60% higher than that of New York City as a whole and can be attributed largely to alcohol and drug abuse by expectant mothers .
