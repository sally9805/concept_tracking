The big conga drums stopped rumbling at about 4:20 a.m. on July 4 , with five or six hard hand cracks , then a great , cavernous quiet . A visitor , sweaty in a winter sleeping bag , half-woke in his tent , wadded what turned out to be a loaf of six-grain bread under his head as a pillow and eased back to sleep . As he did , the drums started again , more softly : **27;10800;TOOLONG . They stopped for good an hour later , just before full light . <P> Welcome home , as the quirky , wistful wanderers who call themselves the Rainbow People say to each other every few minutes for reassurance . Where 's home ? This time it 's in the high meadows in the Green Mountain National Forest , a couple of miles westward and upward from Granville , Vt . Up , down and around for half a mile or more in all directions , there are perhaps 14,000 Rainbows . For the 20th July in a row , mostly to the displeasure of local and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national forest , there peaceably to assemble . And peaceably to shake free of the plastic society , hug each other , wear feathers , wear safety pins through their eyelids ( as a few metal-head teenagers do ) , dance all night , smoke pot ( some of them ) , jiggle around nude ( some of them ) , soak themselves with beer ( a troublesome minority ) , rant or chant or quietly meditate . <P> Need a free meal , a joint , a spiritual jump-start ? Here 's the Looney Saloon , Anni 's Turtle Tea Tree , the Jesus Camp , the Faerie Camp ( from which , periodically , a conga line of guys in net stockings and bras erupts , followed by a very male little old lady in a granny dress , carrying a purse ) , the Contradiction Koffee Kitchen , the No Guns Tipi , the Positively Peaceful Anti- Natural Flatfood Forum ( pancakes here ) , the Om Tea House and Pooh Corner ( a latrine ) . Lovin ' Ovens gives away bread , and Julie , Dianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower essence to improve your cellular vibrations . <P> The Krishna Camp feeds 3,000 people at a time from the best kitchen on the mountain . CALM , the Center for Alternative Living Medicine , soothes the wounded . Several middle-aged fellows from Massachusetts work for three days to get a rustic automatic dishwasher going : press a foot pedal , and out squirts warm water and bleach . For a tribe of peace-and-love anarchists with no structure and no leaders ( their Council is anyone who shows up at the Main Circle ) , the Rainbows ' disorganization is surprisingly effective . <P> Michael , from Wisconsin , who is about 40 , has a subsistence job taking care of animals in a pet store . He guesses that 5% to 10% of the Rainbows are street people or rural itinerants . Some are " Dumpster divers , " who scrounge for food behind restaurants and supermarkets . A larger number live middle- class lives , often with jobs in the social services . And the majority are people in their 20s who work but feel estranged from house-and-mortgage society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looks as if tiredness is a permanent condition , slogs up the four-mile trail from a roadhead at Texas Falls . She carries a big , scruffy backpack and a nursing baby . A couple of other kids skip ahead . She comes to Gatherings because " I can feel safe for a few days . " Safe from what ? She does n't say , and it does n't seem necessary to ask .
