The offer from the Soviet barnstormers is for the well heeled , not the fainthearted . For a mere $10,000 , the American air-show buff can now buy a few minutes of thrills as a passenger in a MiG-29 Fulcrum , the U.S.S.R. 's hottest jet fighter . A few intrepid customers have signed up for rides ranging from a gentle swing around the airfield to a serious workout at 1,500 m.p.h . The thrills start this weekend at Massachusetts ' Westfield-Barnes airport and then continue at shows in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Minnesota , Texas , Kansas and California .
