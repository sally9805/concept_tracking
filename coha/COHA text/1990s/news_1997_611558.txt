<p> Willie Bennett , a black 27-year veteran at Bell Atlantic Corp . in Pennsylvania , said the final straw came at a company party in 1995 . His white co-workers showed him a video they made in which a white co-worker wearing an Afro wig pretended to be Bennett and was portrayed as getting his job because of his basketball-playing skill , he recalled . <p> Derrick Williams , of Alexandria , a 23-year employee at Bell Atlantic , said he is haunted by the memory of finding a fake and crudely racist job application in the copier machine at a company office in Baileys Crossroads six years ago . The form , which purports to be a job application for black job candidates , asks questions such as " name of father ( if known ) , " whether the applicant was born in a " charity hospital " or a " back alley , " and asks how many words the candidate can " jive " per minute . <p> Both men said their supervisors did nothing when they complained . <p> " I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Williams recalled . " They said do n't worry about it . They did n't even investigate . They did n't think it was important . " <p> According to Bennett and Williams and the 124 Bell Atlantic workers who have joined them in a class-action racial discrimination lawsuit against the company , these incidents were not isolated events . In interviews and in the lawsuit filed last year in federal court in the District , workers from the Washington area , Pennsylvania , New Jersey and West Virginia allege that over approximately the past seven years they have been subjected to racial epithets , racist slights and unfair treatment by management and co-workers . <p> Bell Atlantic spokesmen said they are investigating the allegations raised in the lawsuit , but did not deny them . " It 's a huge corporation , " Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said . " Any corporation that said it could n't happen would be unrealistic . " <p> Rabe and others acknowledged some cruel and racist behavior may have occurred at company facilities but that management does not condone or tolerate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , " he said , adding that company officials " do n't want people to be humiliated or abused . " <p> Bell Atlantic officials said they have a strong commitment to hiring and promoting minorities , and they said they believe Bell Atlantic 's record on diversity issues is good . Of its 57,000 employees , 23 percent , or 13,400 , are black , and of its 22 top executives , four are black , the company says , including the group president for consumer and business services and three of the seven people who head Bell Atlantic 's state operations . They also say the company has held regular meetings for rank-and-file workers to discuss these issues and operates a hot line for complaints . <p> " Does Bell Atlantic have a set of policies intending consciously to discriminate ? Absolutely not , " said Bruce Gordon , the group president for consumer and small business , a black executive who has been with Bell Atlantic since 1968 . But he added , referring to the lawsuit , " if this is a way to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit may prove valuable tool for exposing behavior , such as the alleged incidents involving the video and the job application , which Gordon called " totally unacceptable . " He said " nothing like that has previously been brought to my attention , and that blatant mean-spirited behavior has no place at Bell Atlantic . " <p> Gordon said he believes racism remains a problem for Bell Atlantic , as it does throughout society . " Racism may have different characteristics than it did in 1968 , but it still exists . Bell Atlantic is a microcosm of society , and I have to assume there are race-based incidents at Bell Atlantic , " Gordon said . <p> James R. Young , vice president and general counsel of Bell Atlantic , said he could not discuss the specific allegations in the case because it is " currently in litigation . " But he said the company is investigating , and has found " instances where people behaved in ways they should n't . " <p> " We 'll look at these allegations , " Young said . " If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He added that " some disciplinary actions have already been taken , but I ca n't get into that now . " <p> In instances in the past in which workers have used racial epithets , " they 've been fired , " Young said . Within the past two months , for example , the company fired six workers who were exchanging racist e-mail messages , company spokesmen said . <p> Young said supervisors are held accountable as well . " We 've disciplined supervisors for failing to take disciplinary actions against subordinates who did these things , " Young said . <p> Several of the black workers who are suing say that many individual incidents over the years began to add up to them to what they perceive to be an intentional pattern of racism at the telecommunications company . Initially , they said , they were fearful of complaining individually , but several decided two years ago to get together to discuss their experiences in a group . <p> On one summer night in 1995 , four workers met to talk in a room at the Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered , 18 black Bell Atlantic employees attended . And the third time they met , about 60 showed up . Then they decided to sue . Another 66 workers have joined the suit in the past six months . <p> The workers said they went to the church to talk about the discrimination , both subtle and overt , they allege they are experiencing . In interviews and in the legal complaint , many described numerous painful incidents , such as believing they were being excluded by white co-workers from working lunches and meetings , being harshly punished for small infractions that went unpunished among white workers , being targeted for layoffs amid the company downsizing while white people lobbied to save their white friends ' jobs , and being made the butt of jokes about drug-dealing and stolen cars . <p> " Finally you get to the point enough is enough , " said Eric Burden , of Temple Hills , a service technician who joined Bell Atlantic in 1974 . " We 've been abused , neglected and denied year after year . " <p> The lawsuit comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated in a genteel and tightly regulated environment . In the past 13 years the industry has been deregulated , the company has sloughed off 20,800 workers and new standards of performance have been imposed that are designed to boost efficiency and lower costs , but that place new stresses on workers . <p> Bell Atlantic recently received government approval for a merger with Nynex Corp. , New York 's regional telephone company , creating a new firm that will stretch from Maine to North Carolina . About 3,000 jobs will be eliminated over five years as a result of the merger , company officials have said . <p> Gordon , the high-ranking Bell Atlantic executive , said that many black workers troubled by the changes in the corporate environment have come to him to discuss their worries , and he said some of them have wondered whether racism was compounding their problems . <p> " I try to help people distinguish between what is the new norm and that which has some racial basis , " Gordon said . He said that upon investigation , he has found that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It is not only black workers who have been unhappy at Bell Atlantic . " Over the past two to three years , there were some definite morale problems at Bell Atlantic , " said Jeff Miller , a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America union , which represents 35,000 employees at Bell Atlantic and 600,000 telecommunications workers nationwide . <p> Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W. Smith prides himself on having created a lean and mean environment . For example , at a national seminar for chief executives in late 1995 , as angry Bell Atlantic workers picketed outside the building amid acrimonious labor negotiations , Smith described to his fellow executives how he fired a longtime company executive who was a close personal friend . He said the man was unable to make the psychological leap from being a good , obedient soldier who fulfilled all requests to the entrepreneurial visionary Smith was seeking among his managers . <p> Smith said that when his friend came to him asking whether there was a place for him in the newly configured company , Smith told him there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers have left or been asked to leave in the past few years , Gordon said . " A lot of people have come to the conclusion that this is not the business I signed up for , or we helped them make that decision , " Gordon said . The workers who are bringing the suit say that these pressures have made things worse for black employees . Maria Moss , one of the plaintiffs and a former diversity manager , said that workers who get notice of a reduction in force are given 30 days to find new jobs within the company . She said in an interview , and others alleged in the complaint , that they believe white workers help other white workers grab those new jobs , with black workers often left jobless . <p> Moss said she believes the company 's diversity efforts are either window dressing or attempts to build market share in minority communities , and do not address the concerns of minority employees . " What diversity means is send blacks to the black neighborhoods , and send whites to the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees said in the complaint that they believe black workers are sent disproportionately to work in high-crime areas . They said white co-workers use code words for areas with high minority populations , such as " No-Access Jobs , " where they pretend they were barred from entry and leave without performing the work , or " POPs , " shorthand for Puerto Ricans on Porch . The plaintiffs from Lancaster , Pa. , said that South Lime Street , where many minorities live , was labeled " Slime Street . " <p> Bell Atlantic officials declined to comment on these or any other specific allegations in the suit . <p> Almost all of the dozen plaintiffs in the case interviewed for this story said , and allege in their complaint , that they believe they have been unfairly disciplined or fired for offenses that white employees routinely commit without punishment . <p> Shea Chanel Farmer , of Suitland , who worked as a temporary directory assistance operator , said in an interview that she started work on the same day as a white woman her age , and that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time was not . She said in the lawsuit that the white woman was mentored and offered opportunities for better-paying jobs , and she was not . <p> Farmer said she ultimately was fired for tardiness . " They say they are the heart of communications , but they are heartless , " she said . <p> Moss , the former diversity manager , said in the complaint that after a business trip with a white male co-worker , they both submitted identical expense reports because their costs had been the same . But while his expense report was quickly approved , their white supervisor sent hers back , claiming it had too many zeros and fives . " It made me realize I better watch what I 'm doing , " said Moss , who said she was later terminated after a dispute over use of a company credit card . <p> Bell Atlantic would not comment on the reasons either woman left the company .
