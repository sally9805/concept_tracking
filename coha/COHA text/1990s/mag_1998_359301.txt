While the new comedians play the smaller clubs and hone their acts , the man they all want to be is , well , pretty much doing exactly the same thing . Except people are lining up for six hours for the privilege of watching him do it . Jerry Seinfeld has been on a month-long global tour , working out kinks in his stand-up routine in preparation for a five-night , 10-show Broadway run that will include a performance to be aired live on HBO Sunday , Aug. 9 . " Welcome to the Seiny workshop , " he cracked to a sold-out house at an old haunt of his , the 250-seat Comedy &; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach , Calif. , last week . After several years of the lush life of a sitcom phenomenon , is Seinfeld still funny in front of a microphone ? That 's the question he wants answered . The fans , however , seem less interested in having a transcendent comedy experience than in simply getting close to their cathode-ray idol . <P> Fighting off a cold , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked his talking points on a sheet of wrinkled yellow paper , jumping from topic to topic with a disjointed rhythm that diminished his chances of building up a rolling momentum . The first fusillade of jokes  --  how " woos " and " yips " have replaced laughter at shows  --  was classic Seinfeld : gently humorous observations . Then comedy leapfrog . A few comments about death segued into a bit on how the closest equivalent we have to royalty in America is the people who get to ride in electric carts at the airport . By the time the nearly hour-long set ended abruptly with an orgasm gag , he had covered such disparate subjects as answering machines , the irrational fear of rain , annoying hairs in the shower and of course dating ( " a job interview that lasts all night ... " ) . <P> Seinfeld scored best with riffs on the perils of staying up late ( night guy vs. morning guy ) and extreme sports ( " What 's the point of helmets in skydiving ? " ) . Even the master himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking , What 's so great about Australia 's shark-infested Great Barrier Reef ? Predictably  --  but sadly  --  the loudest roars came when Seinfeld agreed to impersonate characters from his show , including Costanza , Kramer and Newman . A crowd pleaser , but not exactly groundbreaking stuff . <P> Still , you 've got to give the man credit for returning to his roots . Comedian David Spade , who was coincidentally shooting a film called Lost and Found only a block away at the same time as Seinfeld 's gig , remarked , " It 's nice that someone still cares about stand-up and does n't just see it as a stepping-stone . " The audience cared too . " It was n't really awesome , " said a young woman who waited outside for six hours in brutal heat to get into the show . " But it was more like , now I can say I saw him . " Woo . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Ressner                    @
