HE WAS AS CLOSE TO DESPAIR as only a lad of seventeen can be . " But you heard what the professor said , " he moaned . " It is all finished . There is nothing left to do . " <p> The lad spoke in German , of course . I had to translate it for Mr. Wells . Wells shook his head . " I fail to see why such splendid news should upset the boy so . " <p> I said to the youngster , " Our British friend says you should not lose hope . Perhaps the professor is mistaken . " <p> " Mistaken ? How could that be ? He is a famous man ! A nobleman ! A baron ! " <p> I had to smile . The lad 's stubborn disdain for authority figures would become world-famous one day . But it was not in evidence this summer afternoon in A.D. eighteen ninety-six . <p> We were sitting in a sidewalk cafe with a magnificent view of the Danube and the city of Linz . Delicious odors of cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the splendid warm sunshine , though , I felt chilled and weak , drained of what little strength I had remaining . <p> " Where is that blasted waitress ? " Wells grumbled . " We 've been here half an hour , at the least . " <p> " Why not just lean back and enjoy the afternoon , sir ? " I suggested tiredly . " This is the best view in all the area . " <p> Herbert George Wells was not a patient man . He had just scored a minor success in Britain with his first novel and had decided to treat himself to a vacation in Austria . He came to that decision under my influence , of course , but he did not yet realize that . At age twenty-nine , he had a lean , hungry look to him that would mellow only gradually with the coming years of prestige and prosperity . <p> Albert was round-faced and plumpish ; still had his baby fat on him , although he had started a mustache as most teenaged boys did in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere near the full white brash it would become . If all went well with my mission . <p> It had taken me an enormous amount of maneuvering to get Wells and this teenager to the same place at the same time . The effort had nearly exhausted all my energies . Young Albert had come to see Prof. Thomson with his own eyes , of course . Wells had been more difficult ; he had wanted to see Salzburg , the birthplace of Mozart . I had taken him instead to Linz , with a thousand assurances that he would find the trip worthwhile . <p> He complained endlessly about Linz , the city 's lack of beauty , the sour smell of its narrow streets , the discomfort of our hotel , the dearth of restaurants where one could get decent food  --  by which he meant burnt mutton . Not even the city 's justly famous Linzertorte pleased him . " Not as good as a decent trifle , " he groused . " Not as good by half . " <p> I , of course , knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in which the city was nothing more than charred radioactive rubble and the Danube so contaminated that it glowed at night all the way down to the Black Sea . I shuddered at that vision and tried to concentrate on the task at hand . <p> It had almost required physical force to get Wells to take a walk across the Danube on the ancient stone bridge and up the Postlingberg to this little sidewalk care . He had huffed with anger when we had started out from our hotel at the city 's central square , then soon was puffing with exertion as we toiled up the steep hill . I was breathless from the climb also . In later years a tram would make the ascent , but on this particular afternoon we had been obliged to walk . <p> He had been mildly surprised to see the teenager trudging up the precipitous street just a few steps ahead of us . Recognizing that unruly crop of dark hair from the audience at Thomson 's lecture that morning , Wells had graciously invited Albert to join us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two after this blasted climb , " he said , eying me unhappily . <p> Panting from the climb , I translated to Albert , " Mr. Wells . . . invites you . . . to have a refreshment . . . with us . " <p> The youngster was pitifully grateful , although he would order nothing stronger than tea . It was obvious that Thomson 's lecture had shattered him badly . So now we sat on uncomfortable cast iron chairs and waited  --  they for the drinks they had ordered , me for the inevitable . I let the warm sunshine soak into me and hoped it would rebuild at least some of my strength . <p> The view was little short of breathtaking : the brooding castle across the river , the Danube itself streaming smoothly and actually blue as it glittered in the sunlight , the lakes beyond the city and the blue-white snow peaks of the Austrian Alps hovering in the distance like ghostly petals of some immense unworldly flower . <p> But Wells complained , " That has to be the ugliest castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentleman say ? " Albert asked . <p> " He is stricken by the sight of the Emperor Friedrich 's castle , " I answered sweetly . <p> " Ah . Yes , it has a certain grandeur to it , does n't it ? " <p> Wells had all the impatience of a frustrated journalist . " Where is that damnable waitress ? Where is our beer ? " <p> " I 'll find the waitress , " I said , rising uncertainly from my iron-hard chair . As his ostensible tour guide , I had to remain in character for a while longer , no matter how tired I felt . But then I saw what I had been waiting for . <p> " Look ! " I pointed down the steep street . " Here comes the professor himself ! " <p> William Thomson , First Baron Kelvin of Largs , was striding up the pavement with much more bounce and energy than any of us had shown . He was seventy-one , his silver-gray hair thinner than his impressive gray beard , lean almost to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had made my heart thunder in my ears as if he were strolling amiably across some campus quadrangle . <p> Wells shot to his feet and leaned across the iron rail of the cafe . " Good afternoon , your Lordship . " For a moment I thought he was going to tug at his forelock . <p> Kelvin squinted at him . " You were in my audience this morning were you not ? " <p> " Yes , m' lud . Permit me to introduce myself : I am H.G. Wells . " <p> " Ah . You 're a physicist ? " <p> " A writer , sir . " <p> " Journalist ? " <p> " Formerly . Now I am a novelist . " <p> " Really ? How keen . " <p> Young Albert and I had also risen to our feet . Wells introduced us properly and invited Kelvin to join us . <p> " Although I must say , " Wells murmured as Kelvin came ' round the railing and took the empty chair at our table , " that the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , you have to know how to deal with the Teutonic temperament , " said Kelvin jovially as we all sat down . He banged the flat of his hand on the table so hard it made us all jump . " Service ! " he bellowed . " Service here ! " <p> Miraculously , the waitress appeared from the doorway and trod stubbornly to our table . She looked very unhappy ; sullen , in fact . Sallow pouting face with brooding brown eyes and downturned mouth . She pushed back a lock of hair that had strayed across her forehead . <p> " We 've been waiting for our beer , " Wells said to her . <p> " And now this gentleman has joined us  --  " <p> " Permit me , sir , " I said . It was my job , after all . In German I asked her to bring us three beers and the tea that Albert had ordered and to do it quickly . <p> She looked the four of us over as if we were smugglers or criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then turned without a word or even a nod and went back inside the cafe . <p> I stole a glance at Albert . His eyes were riveted on Kelvin , his lips parted as if he wanted to speak but could not work up the nerve . He ran a hand nervously through his thick mop of hair . Kelvin seemed perfectly at ease , smiling affably , his hands laced across his stomach just below his beard ; he was the man of authority , acknowledged by the world as the leading scientific figure of his generation . <p> " Can it be really true ? " Albert blurted at last . " Have we learned everything of physics that can be learned ? " <p> He spoke in German , of course , the only language he knew . I immediately translated for him , exactly as he asked his question . <p> Once he understood what Albert was asking , Kelvin nodded his gray old head sagely . " Yes , yes . The young men in the laboratories today are putting the final dots over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . We 've just about finished physics ; we know at last all there is to be known . " <p> Albert looked crushed . <p> Kelvin did not need a translator to understand the youngster 's emotion . " If you are thinking of a career in physics , young man , then I heartily advise you to think again . By the time you complete your education there will be nothing left for you to do . " <p> " Nothing ? " Wells asked as I translated . " Nothing at all ? " <p> " Oh , add a few decimal places here and there , I suppose . Tidy up a bit , that sort of thing . " <p> Albert had failed his admission test to the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich . He had never been a particularly good student . My goal was to get him to apply again to the Polytechnic and pass the exams . <p> Visibly screwing up his courage , Albert asked , " But what about the work of Roentgen ? " <p> Once I had translated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean that report about mysterious rays that go through solid walls ? X-rays , is it ? " <p> Albert nodded eagerly . <p> " Stuff and nonsense ! " snapped the old man . " Absolute bosh . He may impress a few medical men who know little of science , but his x-rays do not exist . Impossible ! German daydreaming . " <p> Albert looked at me with his whole life trembling in his piteous eyes . I interpreted : <p> " The professor fears that x-rays may be illusory , although he does not as yet have enough evidence to decide , one way or the other . " <p> Albert 's face lit up . " Then there is hope ! We have not discovered everything as yet ! " <p> I was thinking about how to translate that for Kelvin when Wells ran out of patience . " Where is that blasted waitress ? " <p> I was grateful for the interruption . " I will find her , sir . " <p> Dragging myself up from the table , I left the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiveled his head back and forth , understanding not a word . Every joint in my body ached and I knew that there was nothing anyone in this world could do to help me . The cafe was dark inside , and smelled of stale beer . The waitress was standing at the bar , speaking rapidly , angrily , to the stout barkeep in a low venomous tone . The barkeep was polishing glasses with the end of his apron ; he looked grim and , once he noticed me , embarrassed . <p> Three seidels of beer stood on a round tray next to her , with a single glass of tea . The beers were getting warm and flat , the tea cooling , while she blistered the bartender 's ears . <p> I interrupted her vicious monologue . " The gentlemen want their drinks , " I said in German . <p> She whirled on me , her eyes furious . " The gentlemen may have their beers when they get rid of that infernal Jew ! " <p> Taken aback somewhat , I glanced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No use asking him to do it , " the waitress hissed . " We do not serve Jews here . I do not serve Jews and neither will he ! " <p> The cafe was almost empty this late in the afternoon . In the dim shadows I could make out only a pair of elderly gentlemen quietly smoking their pipes and a foursome , apparently two married couples , drinking beer . A six-year-old boy knelt at the far end of the bar , laboriously scrubbing the wooden floor . <p> " If it 's too much trouble for you , " I said , and started to reach for the tray . <p> She clutched at my outstretched arm . " No ! No Jews will be served here ! Never ! " <p> I could have brushed her off . If my strength had not been drained away I could have broken every bone in her body and the barkeep 's , too . But I was nearing the end of my tether and I knew it . <p> " Very well , " I said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She glowered at me for a moment , then let her hand drop away . I removed the glass of tea from the tray and left it on the bar . Then I carried the beers out into the warm afternoon sunshine . <p> As I set the tray on our table , Wells asked , " They have no tea ? " <p> Albert knew better . " They refuse to serve Jews , " he guessed . His voice was flat , unemotional , neither surprised nor saddened . <p> I nodded as I said in English , " Yes , they refuse to serve Jews . " <p> " You 're Jewish ? " Kelvin asked , reaching for his beer . <p> The teenager did not need a translation . He replied , " I was born in Germany . I am now a citizen of Switzerland . I have no religion . But , yes , I am a Jew . " <p> Sitting next to him , I offered him my beer . <p> " No , no , " he said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . I think perhaps I should leave . " <p> " Not quite yet , " I said . " I have something that I want to show you . " I reached into the inner pocket of my jacket and pulled out the thick sheaf of paper I had been carrying with me since I had started out on this mission . I noticed that my hand trembled slightly . <p> " What is it ? " Albert asked . <p> I made a little bow of my head in Wells 's direction . " This is my translation of Mr. Wells 's excellent story , The Time Machine . " <p> Wells looked surprised , Albert curious . Kelvin smacked his lips and put his half-drained seidel down . <p> " Time machine ? " asked young Albert . <p> " What 's he talking about ? " Kelvin asked . <p> I explained , " I have taken the liberty of translating Mr. Wells 's story about a time machine , in the hope of attracting a German publisher . " Wells said , " You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time machine ? What on earth would a time machine be ? " <p> Wells forced an embarrassed , self-deprecating little smile . " It is merely the subject of a tale I have written , m' lud : a machine that can travel through time . Into the past , you know . Or the , uh , future . " <p> Kelvin fixed him with a beady gaze . " Travel into the past or the future ? " <p> " It is fiction , of course , " Wells said apologetically . <p> " Of course . " <p> Albert seemed fascinated . " But how could a machine travel through time ? How do you explain it ? " <p> Looking thoroughly uncomfortable under Kelvin 's wilting eye , Wells said hesitantly , " Well , if you consider time as a dimension  --  " <p> " A dimension ? " asked Kelvin . <p> " Rather like the three dimensions of space . " <p> " Time as a fourth dimension ? " <p> " Yes . Rather . " <p> Albert nodded eagerly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever we move through space we move through time as well , do we not ? Space and time ! Four dimensions , all bound together ! " <p> Kelvin mumbled something indecipherable and reached for his half-finished beer . <p> " And one could travel through this dimension ? " Albert asked . " Into the past or the future ? " <p> " Utter bilge , " Kelvin muttered , slamming his emptied seidel on the table . " Quite impossible . " <p> " It is merely fiction , " said Wells , almost whining . " Only an idea I toyed with in order to  --  " <p> " Fiction . Of course , " said Kelvin , with great finality . Quite abruptly , he pushed himself to his feet . " I 'm afraid I must be going . Thank you for the beer . " <p> He left us sitting there and started back down the street , his face flushed . From the way his beard moved I could see that he was muttering to himself . <p> " I 'm afraid we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how could he become angry over an idea ? " Albert wondered . The thought seemed to stun him . " Why should a new idea infuriate a man of science ? " <p> The waitress bustled across the patio to our table . " When is this Jew leaving ? " she hissed at me , eyes blazing with fury . " I wo n't have him stinking up our cafe any longer ! " <p> Obviously shaken , but with as much dignity as a seventeen-year-old could muster , Albert rose to his feet . " I will leave , madame . I have imposed on your so-gracious hospitality long enough . " <p> " Wait , " I said , grabbing at his jacket sleeve . " Take this with you . Read it . I think you will enjoy it . " <p> He smiled at me , but I could see the sadness that would haunt his eyes forever . " Thank you , sir . You have been most kind to me . " <p> He took the manuscript and left us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street toward the bridge back to Linz proper . I hoped he would not trip and break his neck as he ambled down the steep street , his nose stuck in the manuscript . <p> The waitress watched him too . " Filthy Jew . They 're everywhere ! They get themselves into everything . " <p> " That will be quite enough from you , " I said as sternly as I could manage . <p> She glared at me and headed back for the bar . <p> Wells looked more puzzled than annoyed , even after I explained what had happened . <p> " It 's their country , after all , " he said , with a shrug of his narrow shoulders . " If they do n't want to mingle with Jews there 's not much we can do about it , is there ? " <p> I took a sip of my warm flat beer , not trusting myself to come up with a properly polite response . There was only one timeline in which Albert lived long enough to make an effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was gassed in one of the death camps . <p> Wells 's expression turned curious . " I did n't know you had translated my story . " <p> " To see if perhaps a German publisher would be interested in it , " I lied . <p> " But you gave the manuscript to that Jewish fellow . " <p> " I have another copy of the translation . " " You do ? Why would you  --  " <p> My time was almost up , I knew . I had a powerful urge to end the charade . " That young Jewish fellow might change the world , you know . " <p> Wells laughed . <p> " I mean it , " I said . " You think that your story is merely a piece of fiction . Let me tell you , it is much more than that . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Time travel will become possible one day . " <p> " Do n't be ridiculous ! " But I could see the sudden astonishment in his eyes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of time travel to him . We had discussed it for months back when he had been working for the newspapers . I had kept the idea in the forefront of his imagination until he finally sat down and dashed off his novel . <p> I hunched closer to him , leaned my elbows wearily on the table . " Suppose Kelvin is wrong ? Suppose there is much more to physics than he suspects ? " <p> " How could that be ? " Wells asked . <p> " That lad is reading your story . It will open his eyes to new vistas , new possibilities . " <p> Wells cast a suspicious glance at me . " You 're pulling my leg . " <p> I forced a smile . " Not altogether . You would do well to pay attention to what the scientists discover over the coming years . You could build a career writing about it . You could become known as a prophet if you play your cards properly . " <p> His face took on the strangest expression I had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did ; he was suspicious , curious , doubtful and yearning  --  all at the same time . Above everything else he was ambitious ; thirsting for fame . Like every writer , he wanted to have the world acknowledge his genius . <p> I told him as much as I dared . As the afternoon drifted on and the shadows lengthened , as the sun sank behind the distant mountains and the warmth of day slowly gave way to an uneasy deepening chill , I gave him carefully veiled hints of the future . A future . The one I wanted him to promote . <p> Wells could have no conception of the realities of time travel , of course . There was no frame of reference in his tidy nineteenth-century English mind of the infinite branchings of the future . He was incapable of imagining the horrors that lay in store . How could he be ? Time branches endlessly and only a few , a precious handful of those branches manage to avoid utter disaster . <p> Could I show him his beloved London obliterated by fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by man-made plagues ? Or a devastated world turned to a savagery that made his Morlocks seem compassionate ? <p> Could I explain to him the energies involved in time travel or the damage they did to the human body ? The fact that time travelers were volunteers sent on suicide missions , desperately trying to preserve a timeline that saved at least a portion of the human race ? The best future I could offer him was a twentieth century tortured by world wars and genocide . That was the best I could do . <p> So all I did was hint , as gently and subtly as I could , trying to guide him toward that best of all possible futures , horrible though it would seem to him . I could neither control nor coerce anyone ; all I could do was to offer a bit of guidance . Until the radiation dose from my trip through time finally killed me . <p> Wells was happily oblivious to my pain . He did not even notice the perspiration that beaded my brow despite the chilling breeze that heralded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said at last , " that my writings will have some sort of positive effect on the world . " <p> " They already have , " I replied , with a genuine smile . <p> His brows rose . <p> " That teenaged lad is reading your story . Your concept of time as a dimension has already started his fertile mind working . " <p> " That young student ? " <p> " Will change the world , " I said . " For the better . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Really , " I said , trying to sound confident . I knew there were still a thousand pitfalls in young Albert 's path . And I would not live long enough to help him past them . Perhaps others would , but there were no guarantees . <p> I knew that if Albert did not reach his full potential , if he were turned away by the university again or murdered in the coming holocaust , the future I was attempting to preserve would disappear in a global catastrophe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save as much of humanity as I could . <p> I had accomplished a feeble first step in saving some of humankind , but only a first step . Albert was reading the time-machine tale and starting to think that Kelvin was blind to the real world . But there was so much more to do . So very much more . <p> We sat there in the deepening shadows of the approaching twilight , Wells and I , each of us wrapped in our own thoughts about the future . Despite his best English self-control , Wells was smiling contentedly . He saw a future in which he would be hailed as a prophet . I hoped it would work out that way . It was an immense task that I had undertaken . I felt tired , gloomy , daunted by the immensity of it all . Worst of all , I would never know if I succeeded or not . <p> Then the waitress bustled over to our table . " Well , have you finished ? Or are you going to stay here all night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's go , " he said , scraping his chair across the flagstones . <p> I pushed myself to my feet and threw a few coins on the table . The waitress scooped them up immediately and called into the cafe , " Come here and scrub down this table ! At once ! " <p> The six-year-old boy came trudging across the patio , lugging the heavy wooden pail of water . He stumbled and almost dropped it ; water sloshed onto his mother 's legs . She grabbed him by the ear and lifted him nearly off his feet . A faint tortured squeak issued from the boy 's gritted teeth . <p> " Be quiet and your do work properly , " she told her son , her voice murderously low . " If I let your father know how lazy you are . . " <p> The six-year-old 's eyes went wide with terror as his mother let her threat dangle in the air between them . <p> " Scrub that table good , Adolf , " his mother told him . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked down at the boy . His eyes were burning with shame and rage and hatred . Save as much of the human race as you can , I told myself . But it was already too late to save him . <p> " Are you coming ? " Wells called to me . <p> " Yes , " I said , tears in my eyes . " It 's getting dark , is n't it ?
