<p> IS THERE a middle in the new Congress ? The answer is yes and , surprisingly , it may be found on the Republican side of the aisle . Since election day , the new center in Washington has received much less attention than the ideological polarities of the incoming Congress . But that is sure to change as the president and the Congress take up the tasks of governing . <p> On the surface there is no middle , only a polarized , partisan and ideologically split House , dominated by the victorious conservative Republicans . Surveying the 1994 Minnesota Senate race between a left-wing Democrat and a right-wing Republican , political scientist Steve Scheier said , " If you 're standing in the middle , you need binoculars to see either candidate . " The same thing might be said surveying the two parties ' delegations in the new House of Representatives . Democrats are smaller in number but clearly more homogeneously liberal in viewpoint . More than 20 of the departing House Democrats were members of the Conservative Democratic Forum , the Boll Weevil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowland and Dave McCurdy and cutting its ranks virtually in half . <p> At the same time , the new Republican class , 74 strong , is overwhelmingly composed of Gingrichite conservatives , who uniformly ran on the " Contract with America " : less government , term limits and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution . The specter is of a House that can pass partisan and sharply ideologically conservative legislation , only to see it stymied by filibuster or veto  --  a seeming sure-fire formula for gridlock . <p> But that scenario may be too rigid . Power in Congress is not just a process of adding and subtracting numbers and ideologies ; it is much more complicated and variegated than that . The changes in both parties and the dynamics of the new Congress may well create a new set of power brokers who represent the opposite of what conventional wisdom suggests  --  pragmatic leadership interested in bipartisan compromise . This , in turn , could create an opportunity for real action , in the center , on a range of issues . <p> To be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle if the Republicans maintain the extraordinary party discipline they have demonstrated the past two years in the minority , this time to enact a bedrock conservative agenda . Indeed , the GOP has maintained a strikingly high level of party unity for decades , leaving the Democrats to deal with their own disunity . Through four decades in the minority , either stuck with a Democratic president or trying to find ways to build a bipartisan majority to promote a Republican president 's agenda , Republicans in Congress had no alternative to party cohesion to achieve any of their goals . <p> But moving to the majority makes a difference . The larger numbers make unity , especially near-perfect unity , more difficult to achieve . A party with smaller numbers tends to have members who are predominantly from the safest districts , and who are more immune to immediate voter pressures and more willing to subordinate their own desires to the greater goals of the party . In any event , the peer pressures to conform are greater when the numbers are smaller and each marginal vote matters more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always easier to achieve than unity to pass a program  --  especially a controversial one . <p> For all these reasons and more , the majority Democrats have been unable except on rare occasions over the decades of their congressional rule to match their counterparts ' unity . In 20th century American politics this often meant that the key to legislative success was in the hands of a swing group of the more conservative and centrist Democrats  --  the so-called Boll Weevils . Democrats could not form partisan majorities without them ; Republicans could stymie the majority of Democrats by luring the Boll Weevils to form a " conservative coalition " with them . More often than not , through the Roosevelt , Kennedy and Carter administrations and in the early Reagan years , the conservative coalition worked to block liberal social welfare legislation , support strong defense budgets and implement Reagan economic policies in 1981-82 . <p> Since 1983 , coalitional politics in Congress have changed , more than once . After sizable Democratic party gains in the midterm election of 1982 , a conservative coalition became problematic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decline both in relative and absolute terms in the Democratic caucus  --  thanks to the effects of redistricting shaped by the Voting Rights Act . For the final Reagan and the Bush years , finding a majority in the House often forced minority Republicans to capture more than Boll Weevils ; indeed , the need to move further to the center and even to the left to get enough Democrats occasionally led to revolt on the Republican right , most notably as with the 1990 budget agreement . <p> With Bill Clinton in the White House , the coalition dynamics changed again . Republicans united , this time in opposition , leaving Clinton to find his majorities on key votes with Democrats alone , from Boll Weevils to liberals . That worked  --  by the barest of margins  --  on the budget in 1993 , but it fell apart on health care and on the vote on the rule on the crime bill . <p> To be sure , other coalitions did form in the 103rd Congress . One came on NAFTA , where the president was able to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , including from key congressional leaders , but was able to win enough votes in the middle to combine with support from the bulk of Republicans to win a key victory . Another very different coalition emerged on final passage of the crime bill , where a small core group of centrist Republicans joined with the bulk of Democrats against the opposition of the vast majority of the GOP . <p> That kind of coalition in the center was what " New Democrats " like the Democratic Leadership Council had in mind as the rule , not the exception , in the Clinton years . It did n't turn out that way in the 103rd Congress , in part because of the strategy of the White House and congressional Democratic leaders . They tried to form their coalitions with Democrats alone , reaching out to Republicans only at the 11th hour if they fell short in their own ranks . <p> But even when the president tried to build a bipartisan bridge , Republicans usually resisted . Of course , 40 consecutive years of minority status made Republican opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House had suffered from majority arrogance and condescension . There were still times when moderate Republicans considered joining with the president and more like-minded Democratic colleagues  --  but they faced intense pressure from their hard-line colleagues and leaders . <p> Why then should the 104th Congress  --  populated with dozens more hard-line confrontationalists  --  be different ? Ironically , it will be because of the overall level of GOP success , fueled by those same confrontational conservatives . With 230 seats , only a dozen more than needed for a majority , the Republicans have just a small cushion for a purely partisan success . To succeed , the Republican leadership will need the votes of a group of centrist Republicans who are not averse to making bipartisan policy in the middle . <p> They are the swing votes , the 104th Congress 's version of the Boll Weevils . They may drive more confrontational Republican leaders and followers bananas , but the leaders ca n't afford to alienate or punish them any more than the liberal Democratic leaders could afford to punish apostatic Boll Weevils when their partisan margins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontational , Republicans . There are at least 40 candidates for this group in the House . This is no liberal bloc , ready to join forces with the minority Democrats . Indeed , it includes many whose voting records are staunchly conservative , like Henry Hyde of Illinois , John Kasich of Ohio , Jim Kolbe of Arizona and David Dreier of California . Some are close allies , going way back , of Newt Gingrich . But what distinguishes them is their attitude and approach to policy-making and the legislative process . <p> The coalitionist Republicans now have clout . The confrontationalists trash or purge them at their own peril  --  a reality that Gingrich , the presumptive next speaker , has long recognized . Over the years Gingrich has gone out of his way to cultivate and protect coalitionalists like Nancy Johnson of Connecticut and Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin from his own right-wing radicals . <p> Moreover , and just as important , Democrats now ignore the coalitional Republicans at their own peril . If House Democrats and the president have learned anything from their election disaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans at the beginning of the policy process . That in turn will require the large liberal bloc to understand that making policy will require party unity in the center and swallowing some differences . Only then will Clinton and the Democrats have the opportunity to make a center coalition akin to the old Boll Weevil-driven conservative one . <p> These are big ifs , especially for a shell-shocked White House and a Democratic Party inclined to form its firing squads in circles . And even if Democrats show discipline , it will take Republicans a while to loosen their tight reins . Every House Republican comes to the 104th Congress with a profound gratitude to Gingrich for having driven the strategy that led them out of the minority desert to the lush majority oasis . Few , if any , will be willing to buck their leader on key strategic votes on passage of the linchpins of the Contract with America . <p> But votes on amendments to bills in the contract are another story  --  and all the bills will be brought up under open rules . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will prove much less palatable to the less hard-line GOPers . Finding perfect party unity on a welfare reform provision to send children of teenage unwed mothers to orphanages , for example , is not going to be easy to maintain . Nor on a school prayer amendment , nor on provisions to eliminate arts and humanities funding , slash Medicaid or cut back on Head Start  --  all possible targets in the next GOP budget . And bipartisan coalitions on bills like Superfund , safe drinking water , mining reform and telecommunications reform remain tangible possibilities . <p> Remember too that any real centrist coalition on policy in the House will have a receptive audience in the Senate  --  a body with only 53 Republicans , including in their ranks such coalitionists as Mark Hatfield , Jim Jeffords , John Chafee , Bob Packwood , Bill Cohen , Olympia Snowe , Arlen Specter and Nancy Kassebaum . <p> If the Democratic Party can somehow avoid its usual self-destructive and self-righteous impulses  --  no sure thing  --  it will likely have much greater opportunities to shape and direct policy-making in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ironies , thanks to a conservative tide , for the first time since Eisenhower , mainstream Republicans are in a position to be both respected and heeded on both sides of the aisle . <p> Norman Ornstein is a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute .
