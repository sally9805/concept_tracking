October 10 , 2005 Andes Mountains of Peru The skeleton reclined in the sediment of the deep pool as if resting on a soft mattress , the cold unwinking eye sockets of the skull staring upward through the liquid gloom toward the surface 36 meters ( 120 feet ) away . One arm was held in an upright position , the bony fingers of the hand as if beckoning the unwary . From the bottom of the pool to the sun above , the water gradually lightened from a dismal gray-brown to a pea-soup green from the pond scum that flourished under the tropical heat . The circular rim stretched 30 meters ( 98 feet ) across and the sheer walls dropped 15 meters ( 49 feet ) to the water . Once in , there was no way a human or animal could escape without help from above . The place was more than a sacred well where men , women , and children had been thrown alive into the dark waters as sacrifices during times of drought and harsh storms . Ancient legends and myths called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events occurred . There were also tales of rare artifacts , handcrafted and sculpted , along with jade , gold , and precious that were said to have been cast into the pool to appease the evil gods who were ad weather . In 1964 two divers entered the depths of the sinkhole and never returned . No attempt had been made to recover their bodies . A great deal of unresolved controversy had surrounded the sacred pool since then , and now archaeologists had finally gathered to dive and retrieve artifacts from its enigmatic depths . The ancient site was located on a western slope beneath a high ridge of the Peruvian Andes near a great ruined city . The nearby stone structures had been part of a vast confederation of city-states , known as the Chachapoyas , that was conquered by the renowned Inca empire around A.D. 1480 . As she stared down at the stagnant water through big , wide , hazel eyes under raised dark brows , Dr. Shannon Kelsey was too excited to feel the cold touch of fear . Her hair was straight and soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the skin that showed on her face , arms , and legs was richly tanned . Dr. Kelsey had enjoyed a ten-year fascination with the Chachapoyan cultures . To work where an enigmatic and obscure people had flourished and died was a dream made possible by a grant from the Archaeology Department of Arizona State University . " Useless to carry a video camera unless the visibility opens up below the first two meters , " said Miles Rodgers , the photographer who was filming the project . " Then shoot stills , " Shannon said firmly . " I want every dive recorded whether we can see past our noses or not . " Rodgers was an old pro at underwater photography . He was in demand by all the major science and travel publications to shoot below-the-sea photos of fish and coral reefs . His extraordinary pictures of World War II shipwrecks in the South Pacific and ancient submerged seaports throughout the Mediterranean had won him numerous awards and the respect of his peers . A tall , slender man in his sixties , with a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon 's air tank so she could slip her arms through the straps of the backpack . " I wish you 'd put a hold on this until we 've finished constructing the dive raft . " ... Shannon smiled at her colleague , Dr. Steve Miller from the University of Pennsylvania . " That 's two days away . By doing a preliminary survey now we can get a head start . " " Then at least wait for the rest of the dive team to arrive from the university . If you and Miles get into trouble , we have no backup . " " Not to worry , " Shannon said . " Miles and I will only do a bounce dive to test depth and water conditions . We wo n't run our dive time past thirty minutes . " Shannon spit into her face mask , smearing the saliva around the inside of the lens to keep it from misting . Next she rinsed the mask from a canteen of water . After adjusting her buoyancy compensator and cinching her weight belt , she and Rodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satisfied everything was in place and their digital dive computers properly programmed , Shannon smiled at Miller . " See you soon , Doc ! " The anthropologist looped under their arms a wide strap that was attached to long nylon lines , gripped tightly by a team of ten Peruvian graduate students of the university 's archaeology program , who had volunteered to join the project . " Lower away , kids , " Miller ordered . Hand over hand the lines were paid out as the divers began their descent into the ominous pool below . Shannon and Rodgers extended their legs and used the tips of their dive fins as bumpers to keep from scraping against the rough limestone walls . They could clearly see the coating of slime covering the surface of the water . The aroma of decay and stagnation was overwhelming . To Shannon the thrill of the unknown abruptly changed to a feeling of deep apprehension . When they were within 1 meter ( about 3 feet ) of the surface , they both inserted their air regulator mouthpieces between their teeth and signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miles slipped out of their harnesses and dropped out of sight into the odious slime . Miller nervously paced the rim of the sinkhole , glancing at his watch every other minute while the students peered in fascination at the green slime below . Fifteen minutes passed with no sign of the divers . Suddenly , the exhaust bubbles from their air regulators disappeared . Frantically Miller ran along the edge of the well . Had they found a cave and entered it ? He waited ten minutes , then ran over to a nearby tent and rushed inside . Almost feverishly he picked up a portable radio and began hailing the project 's headquarters and supply unit in the small town of Chachapoyas , 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) to the south . The voice of Juan Chaco , inspector general of Peruvian archaeology and director of the Museo de la Nacin in Lima , answered almost immediately . " Juan here . That you , Doc ? What can I do for you ? " " Dr. Kelsey and Miles Rodgers insisted on making a preliminary dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we may have an emergency . " " They went into that cesspool without waiting for the dive team from the university ? " Chaco asked in a strangely indifferent tone . " I tried to talk them out of it . " " When did they enter the water ? " Miller checked his watch again . " Twenty-seven minutes ago . " " How long did they plan to stay down ? " " They planned to resurface after thirty minutes . " " It 's still early . " Chaco sighed . " So what " s the problem ? " " We 've seen no sign of their air bubbles for the last ten minutes . " Chaco caught his breath , closed his eyes for a second . " Does n't sound good , my friend . This is not what we planned . " " Can you send the dive team ahead by helicopter ? " asked Miller . " Not possible , " Chaco replied helplessly . " They 're still in transit from Miami . Their plane is n't scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't afford government meddling . Certainly not now . Can you arrange to have a dive rescue team rushed to the sinkhole ? " " The nearest naval facility is at Trujillo . I 'll alert the base commander and go from there . " " Good luck to you , Juan . I 'll stand by the radio at this end . " " Keep me informed of any new developments . " " I will , I promise you , " Miller said grimly . In Chachapoyas , Chaco pulled out a handkerchief and mopped his face . He was a man of order . Unforeseen obstacles or problems irritated him . If the two stupid Americans drowned themselves , there would be a govemment inquiry . Despite Chaco 's influence , the Peruvian news media were bound to make an overblown incident out of it . The consequences might very well prove to be nothing less than disastrous . " All we need now , " he muttered to himself , " are two dead archaeologists in the pool .
