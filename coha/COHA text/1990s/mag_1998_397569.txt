<p> Like Coke , Nike , and the tobacco industry before it , Microsoft now has to hook new consumers abroad . But the company has discovered a way to bully foreign companies into buying Microsoft  --  and only Microsoft . <p> In 1995 , the national telephone company of Uruguay , was caught pirating $100,000 worth of unlicensed software programs from Microsoft , Novell , and Symantec . Antel was nabbed by the Business Software Alliance , a trade association that partly acts as a global bounty hunter for the software industry . The BSA 's lawyers in Uruguay quickly filed suit . <p> But instead of waiting for a ruling on the case , the BSA abruptly dropped the suit in the fall of 1997 . The BSA receives funding from most of the top software companies but appears to be most heavily funded by Microsoft . And , according to Antel 's information technology manager , Ricardo Tascenho , the company settled the matter by signing a " special agreement " with Microsoft to replace all of its software with Microsoft products . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tascenho 's story : <p> " Microsoft told me to stop working on the case because they would write an agreement with Antel . " DeFreitas says 8Microsoft 's Uruguay manager , Tomas Blatt , instructed him to drop the suit so that Microsoft could " work out a deal for the future . " Blatt refused to answer questions about the settlement , claiming , " I do n't have any information about the Antel case .... You should call BSA in Uruguay  --  Eduardo DeFreitas . " <p> Antel 's situation suggests that when the BSA cracks down on piracy overseas , it 's Bill Gates who turns out to be the pirate . Representatives from rival firms complain that Microsoft is abusing its power within the BSA to speed its global dominance . <p> Microsoft denies that the BSA acts solely on its behalf . " I am not aware of any instance where that has happened , " says Microsoft attorney Brad Smith . And the BSA dismisses the charges ; spokeswoman Diane Smiroldo calls them " hard to believe . " But officials at Novell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped actively participating in the BSA 's programs in Asia and Latin America . Novell says these allegations played a part in its decision ; Lotus refuses to comment . Such concerns are also among the reasons Netscape is reluctant to join the BSA , says Netscape attorney Peter Harter . <p> The accusations are n't just limited to Uruguay : <p> Felipe Yungman , Novell 's manager of security for Argentina , says he and another staffer at Novell discovered , while pursuing their own investigation for the company , that the BSA was setting up sweetheart deals for Microsoft . " Companies or government offices had to , as a condition that the BSA forgive them of piracy , replace Novell products with Microsoft products , " he says . <p> Yungman would not divulge the names of the companies he believes were bullied by Microsoft , saying that he is trying to convince them to come forward . " Most of the companies do n't want to get involved , " he explains . " They think they need Microsoft . You can not oblige them to testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Latin America , supports Yungman 's allegations . " If you call BSA , you will reach Microsoft , " he says . " They shield Microsoft 's actions with the BSA name . It 's bad for us and for the software industry . " <p> In 1996 , when the BSA sued the Australian shipping company Toll Holdings for piracy , BSA lawyer Charles Gonsalves , of the Sydney-based firm of Mallesons Stephen Jaques , oversaw the case . <p> " I generally handle cases for both Microsoft and the BSA , " Gonsalves told Mother Jones . <p> But while the suit alleged that Toll illegally used copies of programs made by Lotus , Novell , Symantec , and Microsoft , Martin Dunne , Toll 's chief information technology officer , says the company settled by paying fines to only Symantec and Microsoft . And , Dunne says , other than keeping Symantec 's anti-virus software , the company has made a significant change : Toll only buys Microsoft now . <p> According to a Novell official , Toll " offered to legalize on all Microsoft products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BSA and Toll deny any impropriety . While a written agreement between Toll and Gonsalves does exist , neither party would reveal the terms of the settlement . When Gonsalves was asked if Microsoft ever paid for his handling of BSA cases , he chuckled and said , " That 's a confidential matter . " <p> In Slovenia , where 96 percent of all software is pirated , the head of the BSA office , Aaron Marko , is also Microsoft 's country manager . Marko says that because enforcement is difficult in the country 's court system , he offers discounted Microsoft software to companies caught pirating by the BSA . Does Marko see this as a conflict of interest , since he also supposedly represents other software firms ? " BSA is trying to find the pirate . Then it is a question of marketing and product awareness to see who will get the legal market share , " he says . When asked which BSA members have local subsidiaries that do local marketing , Marko says only Microsoft and Oracle , which is not a direct Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the BSA serves the interest of its members or whether it serves its dominant member , " says James Love , director of Ralph Nader 's Consumer Project on Technology . And for the foreign companies , he says , " these seem to be stories of blackmail . " <p> The BSA employs a team of more than 100 lawyers and investigators to find cases of software piracy  --  a crime it says costs the industry $11 billion a year . The BSA says it catches " thousands of cases a year , " many through its 55 piracy hotlines , the most famous of which urges employees to " Nail Your Boss " by calling . <p> While the BSA wo n't release its funding details , it does say that money comes from membership dues , which are based on each company 's software revenues . This is one way in which Microsoft dominates the BSA : Microsoft 's annual revenues , for example , are eight times that of Novell , its largest rival . <p> In the future , Novell and Lotus say they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Latin America . <p> But other BSA members , while concerned about Microsoft 's role in the organization , are n't quite willing to go their own way . Greg Wrenn , senior corporate counsel for Adobe , says his company has stayed with the BSA despite having had some uneasy experiences with Microsoft . For example , Wrenn says , the Microsoft attorneys who worked for the BSA refrained from going after big Microsoft clients caught pirating Adobe products  --  until Adobe prodded them . <p> Wrenn says Adobe will stay in the BSA , pressuring the organization to play fair . But he acknowledges Microsoft 's upper hand . " If an attorney does Microsoft work and BSA work and never hears from another company besides Microsoft , he 's going to do the work for the guy who 's in his office every week , " Wrenn says . <p> Unquote : Microsoft appears to use a software industry trade association to cheat , bullying foreign companies into buying only Microsoft products . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Overseas invasion <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Former Indian Prime Minister H.D.
