Information Overload ? <p> Sulfiting warnings at restaurant salad bars ... Wax coating statements in produce sections of food stores ... A cancer warning on saccharin ... Proper handling instructions on packages of raw flesh foods ... A voluntary label warning on unpasteurized juices ... Advisories about health risks of eating raw shellfish ... <p> These are a few of the growing numbers of cautions , warnings , and advisories given to food shoppers and food preparers . Based on recent findings , some may be justified , others may reinforce what is already known , but some may be merely frivolous and unnecessarily add to the clutter . <p> Advisories and Warnings . Fish consumption advisories are at an all-time high . The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) reported that there are nearly 2,200 such advisories in effect , and they are increasing by 20% yearly . They cover 15% of all U.S. lakes , including the Great Lakes , and 5% of U.S. rivers . The advisories list some 45 contaminants , mainly mercury , PCBs , chlordane , dioxin , and DDT . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contaminant assessments rather than increased contamination . The EPA issues different types of advisories , depending on the degree of the health risk . When the general population is at risk , a no-consumption general population advisory is issued . When certain subgroups , such as pregnant and lactating women , and children may be at risk , a no-consumption specific population advisory is issued for contaminated fish or wildlife . The EPA may issue restricted consumption advisories directed to the general population or to sensitive subgroups . Or , the EPA may issue a commercial fishing ban that prohibits the harvest and sale of all species identified in the ban . <p> For years , the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) had recommended to judge doneness of cooked hamburger by color and juice . Recently , the agency has withdrawn this advice , and now recommends the use of a meat thermometer . The USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) has advised that all of the agency 's publications that contain the earlier recommendations should not be distributed until they can be revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many food preparers continue to follow the earlier recommendations because they feel that meat thermometers are " impractical " with hamburger use . ( See box , page 26 . ) <p> Even small businesses have become concerned about potential lawsuits resulting from foodborne illnesses . Some owners are taking advisories to the next step . A food outlet in Saranac Lake , N.Y. , now requires its customers to sign waivers if they request hamburgers less than well cooked . <p> In view of recent findings , some researchers recommend that information about trans fatty acids deserves to be listed specifically on food labels , separate from other fat listings . This recommendation was made by the Wageningen Agricultural University , and endorsed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization . Many lipid researchers in the United States and elsewhere also support this proposal , although some believe that the listing may be premature . ( See " Why Butter is Good for You , " CR , March 1996 . ) <p> California Proposition 65 , effective since 1986 , requires warnings on products with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gram ) of lead . This limit applies to dietary calcium supplements and calcium-containing antacids , but it does not apply to food . <p> Import Labeling . At present , only minuscule amounts of imported foods are inspected by federal officials , yet seizures are much greater with them than with domestically-produced foods . Interest has developed to label food with its country-of-origin , especially in the wake of outbreaks of illnesses such as hepatitis A from Mexican strawberries , cyclospora from Guatemalan raspberries , and E.coli 0157:H7 from Canadian beef . Also , from time to time , there are seizures of imported produce with illegally high levels of residues of approved pesticides , or residues of banned pesticides . The U.S. Custom Service has proposed federal regulations that would mandate front-panel country-of-origin labeling for imported frozen produce . This proposal has widespread support from groups such as the American Farm Bureau and the Florida Department of Agriculture . It is opposed by the American Frozen Food Institute , a group that describes such legislation as creating nontariff barriers . <p> " Imported vs. domestic " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Hampshire lawmakers passed legislation to ensure the authenticity of products grown on local farms . As a result , it is illegal for retailers to designate anything originating outside of the state borders as " local , " " locally grown , " " locally produced , " or " native . " The ludicrous result is that such terms can not be applied to many products brought in from the neighboring state of Vermont ( merely across a river ) , yet the terms can be applied to products shipped from the distances of hundreds of miles within the state . <p> Special Labeling Information . Some people with special health needs seek better label information . For example , individuals concerned with weight reduction would like to have food labels state calories per ounce . Those who are sensitive to very low levels of certain food additives , such as sulfiting agents or monosodium glutamate , want declarations of sources and amounts of these substances , even if the levels are below the official tolerances . Individuals who are lactose-or gluten-intolerant want clearer information so that offending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other people seek to have specific flavors or seasonings stated on labels . <p> To date , food products that contain genetically engineered ingredients are not required to have any special label statement , unless the food 's composition differs significantly from its conventional counterpart . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approves each food on a case-by-case basis . In a " Consumers Right to Know " initiative , some 120 scientists , doctors , legislators , food industry members , government officials , and others requested labeling of genetically-engineered food . The European Union requires a label declaration if genetically-modified organisms are in food . This policy has created a trade barrier issue . <p> The issue has been fought legally . In one case , Ben &; Jerry 's persuaded the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago to allow its ice cream products to be labeled as being free of recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone ( rBGH ) , and a statement as to why the company opposes use of the hormone . However , the company encountered problems elsewhere . Ultimately , a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We oppose recombinant bovine growth hormones . The farmers who supply our milk and cream pledge not to treat their cows with rBGH . " <p> The FDA challenged the statement , and issued interim guidelines on voluntary labeling . As a result , the following statement must also appear on the label : " FDA has said no significant difference has been shown and no test can now distinguish between milk from rBGH treated and untreated cows . " Ben &; Jerry 's decided to add a caveat to the text , stating that not all of its ingredient suppliers  --  such as chocolate chips  --  can promise that the milk they use comes from untreated cows . It is quite a feat to print this extensive text on an ice cream lid ( If irradiated food becomes widespread , expect a similar pattern . No doubt , some producers will desire to make a label statement that their food is untreated , and the FDA probably will mandate an additional statement that there is no significant difference between irradiated and non-irradiated food . ) <p> Changing Information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to foods or beverages . Caffeine is classified as GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) . The FDA is considering a petition to have caffeine levels listed on labels . ( This request is reminiscent of earlier requests for the alcoholic content listing on beer labels . See " More Informative Beer Labels , " CR , October 1996 . ) <p> After a warning label has been established , it is rare to have it withdrawn . However , this action might be taken with saccharin . <p> In 1977 , based on findings , the FDA proposed a saccharin ban . The U.S. Congress intervened and passed a moratorium on the ban , but required a warning label to state that " use of this product may be hazardous to your health . This product contains saccharin , which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory rats . " <p> Twenty years later , in 1997 , the National Institutes of Health announced that it was reviewing data from its National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) that could delist saccharin from NTP 's Biennial Report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a known carcinogen . " Guidelines established in 1996 had broadened the criteria for review , and allow for substances to be removed from the list . Delisting could result in the removal of the present warning statement on saccharin . However , in late October 1997 , a panel of independent experts recommended that saccharin remain on the government 's list of suspected carcinogens . Although the panel 's recommendation carries great weight with the NTP , the recommendation is not binding . Removal of the warning statement could be achieved through FDA rulemaking or an act of Congress . Either group could drop the warning statement , despite the NTP classification . <p> Information Overload . " We need to know what consumers want to know and what behavior practices they are willing to adopt , " noted Vicky Fremuth , from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . She referred to the science of " social marketing " at the first national meeting of food safety educators , convened jointly by the CDC , FDA , and the USDA . Research showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time they practice more unsafe food-handling practices . Are the numerous advisories and cautionary warnings being ignored ? <p> The " disconnect " has reasons , suggested Alan Levy , chief of FDA 's Consumer Studies Branch . For the past 30 years , Levy reports , " a dominant theme has been that we have the safest food supply in the world . Consumers have internalized this message and believe that problems can be solved by government controls and not by personal behavior . People think that food-safety failure occurs in processing plants and restaurants , but not in their own homes or due to their own actions . " Levy notes that focus-group work concerning the dangers of Vibrio vulnificus in shellfish found that people were knowledgeable about the risks , but considered themselves " experts " in knowing how to control the risks ( see " Foodborne Viral Illness " CR , August 1989 ) . The focus group found that people had a negative reaction to consumer warnings about V. vulnificus . The common response was that they know , and do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about food-safety issues , have serious misconceptions about food-borne illnesses and their consequences . According to Levy , " to the extent that people do n't see this as a serious problem , they wo n't feel an urgency to change their behavior . " And advisories may fall on deaf ears . <p> The FDA 's social marketing team attempted to teach safe food handling practices during summer cookouts . Team members conducted interviews , and videotaped picnickers at a local park . The setting provided real-life feedback from participants about their perceptions of safe food handling . Among the samplings were : " I 'm not at risk ( be ) cause I know the grocery store where I shop , " " the important thing is to have a real hot flame ( on the grill ) , then you know the food will be O.K. , " and " there 's no water here , so I use a bit of alcohol to clean my hands . " <p> The American Dietetic Association 's Nutrition Trends Survey found that more Americans are paying " only slightly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1997 , compared to 1995 . As consumers are subjected to more and more advisories , the information needs to be sorted out . Is it vital or frivolous ? Or , does it merely reinforce what is already known ? Should it be voluntary or mandatory ? How much is enough , and how much is overkill ? The answers are not easy , but judgments need to be made , as more and more messages continue to clutter shopping expeditions and food preparation activities . How Effective ? <p> " Not practical , " or " not necessary " were two of the dismissive responses to a panel of social marketers who questioned people about the use of meat thermometers . The panel then brainstormed about motivating food preparers to use meat thermometers . First , they defined their audience . Men were targeted , because demographic data showed that men frequently prepare cookouts . Next , the panelists attempted to devise some strategy to motivate the men to use meat thermometers . The problem might not be an advisory to cook meat adequately , but rather to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacle : if a man used a meat thermometer , others might think that he did not know what he was doing . " If the image of a guy using a meat thermometer is one of not being a ' real guy ' how can we re-position that image ? " asked one panelist . One suggestion offered was the use of a high-tech thermometer with " guy appeal . " Another was to encourage a meat thermometer cook-off competition . The social marketers believed that just because the use of a meat thermometer is a tough sell , it is not necessarily a no-sell . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Beatrice Trum Hunter <p> <p> Mrs. Hunter is food editor of CR . <p>
