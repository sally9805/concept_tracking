// before you wolf down that double cheeseburger or take a swig of diet cola , you may want to peek through the family album - the family of mankind , that is . Neither of these foods ( or any processed food , for that matter ) ever graced the lips of Cave Woman Jane . Check out her dwelling , and you 'll find etchings of fish , deer , even wild boar . But when 's the last time you saw a petroglyph of a Pop Tart or a pepperoni pizza ? For millions of years our ancestors evolved on diets of plants and very lean wild game , says S. Boyd Eaton , M.D. , adjunct associate professor of anthropology at Emery University in Atlanta and author of The Paleolithic Prescription ( Harper &; Row , 1988 ) . Apparently their diets served them well . Thanks to a plant-based , nutrient-rich diet and vigorous lifestyle , Cave Woman Jane , who arrived on the scene about 40,000 years ago , was probably as fit , lean , and strong as today 's well-trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , life expectancy at birth was very low . Nevertheless , those who did n't die in childbirth or from the ravages of infancy , battle , the hunt or other factors ( including genetic flaws ) , had the potential of living to a ripe old age - or up to 120 years , the same as todayaccording to Leonard Hayflick , Ph.D. , author of How and Why We Age ( Cell Associates Inc. , 1994 ) . Remember that our ancestors had the same luck of the genetic draw as we do today - with the right parents , we could live to be 100 ; with the wrong ones , we could do everything right and still not live past 65 . Even so , far fewer people in Jane 's day suffered from cancer , diabetes , hypertension and osteoporosis  --  diseases that may be triggered by a poor diet , says Eaton . Archeological evidence indicates that our ancestral elders were robust and strong , engaging in battles well past today 's retirement age . With the exception of arthritis , their healthy diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflict us today  --  those Eaton listed as possibly triggered in part by diet . So Much for Progress As the centuries rolled by , the advent of farming followed by the Industrial Revolution and the onslaught of fast food ushered in cataclysmic changes to Jane 's dietary habits , converting her from a hunter/gatherer to a farmer and finally to a woman who " picked " her food not from bushes or fields but from supermarket shelves . Yet it takes tens of thousands of years for the body to adapt to even small modifications in the environment , says Eaton . Despite drastic changes in culture , lifestyle and diet , our biochemistry and physiology are still fine-tuned to diets and activity levels that existed 10,000 years and more ago . " For millions and millions of years , people were hunters and gatherers , " Eaton says . " Compare that to the 500 generations people have been farmers , the 10 generations since the Industrial Age and the one generation since computers , and you see that there have been major changes in how we live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same Old Genes Escalating obesity rates are just one result when genetics and lifestyle collide . " Those of our ancestors who stored fat efficiently resisted starvation during famines and lived to reproduce , " says George Armelagos , Ph.D. , professor of anthropology at Emory University in Atlanta and author of Consuming Passions : The Anthropology of Eating ( Pocket Books , 1983 ) . " But our bodies were n't designed for today 's never-ending abundance of easily digested carbohydrates and fats , along with no activity . " Today we are Janes in Calvin Klein jeans , genetically programmed to thrive on a diet of nuts , seeds , leaves , honey and wild game but subsisting instead on a diet high in fat and sugar and low in fiber - one that 's as alien to our bodies as is a meal from Mars . We consume just a fraction of the antioxidants , calcium , iron and other minerals that our ancestors ate every day . It 's no wonder we 're experiencing runaway rates of diabetes , osteoporosis and heart disease all related largely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed enough vitamins , minerals , phytochemicals and fiber to defend her against nearly every form of degenerative disease without the saving grace of modern-day medicine , so imagine what it could do for us . To find out for yourself , follow us back in time to when men were men and women really knew how to eat . We 'll show you how to obtain maximum health and vitality ( and maintain your weight ) by eating in balance with your evolutionary makeup - as Jane did . We 'll also provide you with a five-day Stone Age Diet Meal Plan , page 90 , that takes you back to nutritional basics in a delightfully delicious , modern-day way ( no digging sticks or clubs required ) . Maybe Jane could n't read , write or count fat grams , but after a week on this meal plan , we think you 'll agree there was nothing primitive about the way she ate . New Age vs . Stone Age Diets // The Stone Age Pyramid Photograph Photograph // So just how different was Jane 's diet from ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of healthy foods than we do . While she did n't have 89 varieties of breakfast cereal from which to choose , her natural " supermarket " was stocked with 50,000 to 100,000 edible plants ( and only 600 of them have ever been cultivated ) . " Once people began to subsist on farming , rather than the diversified food supply obtained from hunting and gathering , they depended more and more on staples like corn and wheat , " explains Armelagos . Jane also consumed three or more times the amount of plant foods that we do about nine servings daily of fruits and vegetables vs. the American average of three or four , says Susan Krebs-Smith , Ph.D. , research nutritionist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Md . And our servings typically include just one portion of a dark green leafy vegetable each week , with potatoes being the top-ranking vegetable in our diet . Worse , only 9 percent of us meet even the minimum daily recommendations for five fruits and vegetables - the most nutrient-dense foods - and that 's a conservative recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston . " While it 's not yet known what constitutes an optimum amount of fruits and vegetables , we do know the more you eat , the more protection you get , " says Winston J. Craig , Ph.D. , RD. , chairman and professor of nutrition at Andrews University in Berrien Springs , Mich . Life Before Bessie Even without cows and yogurt stands , Jane managed to get more calcium than we do , primarily because of the dark green leafy veggies in her diet - 1,900 milligrams compared with the 600 most women consume these days . This may explain why osteoporosis was rare in humans preagriculture despite the absence of dairy products . In addition , Jane consumed three times more vitamin Bsub 12 than we do , two times more folic acid , eight times more vitamin C , five times more fiber ( about 100 grams vs. our 15-20 grams ) and a whopping 10 grams of beta carotene daily  --  compared to the 1 or 2 milligrams we get today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also minimal : about 770 milligrams of sodium daily compared to our 20,000-plus milligrams , Eaton says . And while plants were the mainstay of her diet , when Jane managed to hunt down a critter for dinner , it was usually ultralean wild game like deer or boar , with far less saturated fat than our domesticated meats have ( 4 percent vs. 25 percent to 30 percent ) and far more healthy polyunsaturated fats and Omega-3 fatty acids. jungle Workout A healthy diet was just part of Jane 's recipe for living a long and healthy life . Unlike modern-day women , who consider it a good week if they squeeze in three 30-minute workouts , Jane was a study in perpetual motion . Her very survival , until the advent of agriculture 10,000 years ago , relied on spending entire days hiking and climbing for food - often while packing a 20-pound baby on her back , Eaton says . To fuel her labor , she consumed about 3,000 calories a day or more - which may sound like a lot until you start adding up all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bag of fries or a slice of cheesecake ) . Only within our grandparents ' lifetimes has physical activity plummeted drastically . At the turn of the century , most people walked an average of seven miles a day . The mechanization of farming alone dropped energy expenditure by 50 percent ; between 1956 and 1990 , labor-saving devices cut it by 65 percent . We 're not suggesting you quit your job to forage for meals , but it 's obvious that our Stone Age bodies thrive on far more movement than we 're giving them . The Stone Age Dozen You may be closer to your inner Cave Woman than you think . Much of Jane 's evolutionary lifestyle fits easily into current diet and exercise recommendations - it just takes those recommendations a few steps further . Here are a dozen easy ways to move even closer to Jane 's great diet and exercise habits . 1 . Eat like an ape . Go beyond the USDA food pyramid 's five servings of produce per day mantra and shoot for at least two fruits and/or vegetables at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Consider skipping the french fries and focus on anything with color , crunch and juice - from leafy greens and carrots to oranges and apricots . 2 . Learn to love it raw . Eat one third to one half of your produce raw . Grow your own whenever possible . 3 . Seek unprocessed grains . The carbohydrates in the Stone Age diet came from roots , tubers , berries , shoots , leaves , flowers , seeds , fruits , legumes , fungi , seeds and honey . " People did n't evolve eating refined grains , " says Walter Willett , M.D. , Dr. PH. , at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston . " We 're much better off eating breads and cereals in their whole-grain forms . " 4 . Grow a milk mustache . Stone Agers did n't have cows , which means they consumed no milk , yogurt or cheese . Today we 're hard-pressed to meet our daily calcium allotments without dairy products . Include two or three nonfat milk products in your daily menu , which will eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Eat meat , but only extra lean . Modern meats that most resemble wild game include fish , shellfish and white-meat poultry . Roasting , baking , grilling and steaming would be most akin to Stone Age cuisine . 6 . Eat fat and sugar sparingly . Other than meat , the only fats in the Stone Age diet came from seeds , nuts and regional goodies like avocados or olives . Use nut and olive oils in moderation . Limit refined sugars and use small amounts of honey or molasses . 7 . It 's still the best drink on earth . Water was the beverage of choice for Stone Agers , so make sure you drink at least 8 cups daily ; more if you exercise . 8 . Hold the added salt and take it easy on alcoholic beverages . There is an overabundance of salt in our foods , particularly in our processed food choices . Wean your taste buds to enjoy less salty flavors. 9 . Become a grazer . Stone Agers invented snacking and grazing . Eat a small meal or snack every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be more Jane-like , aim to accumulate an hour or more of exercise during the course of each day . Do n't use energy saving devices : Walk or bicycle rather than drive , take the stairs , not the escalator , turn a manual can opener , push a motorless lawn mower . Also combine weight training with cardiovascular exercise , a crosstraining mix that most closely resembles the variety of exercise Jane got . 11 . Learn how to create a temporary food shortage . Stone Agers averaged a lower percent body fat and body weight than modern humans do . When you notice your weight creeping higher , do what your ancestors were forced to do and create a temporary food shortage : Lower calorie intake and increase daily activity . dust make sure you do n't diet drastically or exercise excessively , which will put your body in starvation mode. ) 12 . Take your vitamins . Even the best diet is no match for that of our ancestors . Take a moderate-dose multiple vitamin and mineral supplement to fill in the nutritional gaps .
