The revolution of 1989 short-circuited history , jolting the late 20th century with some vexations that everyone thought would wait until the 21st . In no time at all , German unification went from almost unthinkable to all but unstoppable . Last week 's hints out of Bonn that citizens of both Germanys will vote for a single parliament later this year was just the latest reminder that from now on , there will be German answers to the German question in all its complex and troubling dimensions . The four wartime Allies that crushed the Third Reich in 1945 can still consult , negotiate and harrumph to their hearts ' content , but they can not dictate on any matter . That includes the most sensitive and controversial of all : whether a united and fully sovereign Germany will eventually become a nuclear power . <P> During a visit to Camp David in February , Helmut Kohl was asked whether his country would " see fit to develop an independent nuclear-weapons capability . " <P> " No , " said the Chancellor . " This discussion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an atomic power . " <P> That was an artful dodge . The question pertained not to any current debate going on in Germany but to a dilemma that could arise years from now . By then the U.S.S.R. may have shrunk and changed its name , but it will doubtless still be a large country armed with far too many weapons of mass destruction for the comfort of its neighbors . <P> Tomorrow 's Germans may not be " longing " for a nuclear status symbol any more than today 's are . They may have followed the example of Japan , that other phoenix risen from the ashes of World War II , and learned to be an economic superpower without wanting , or even needing , commensurate military might . But like everyone else , the Germans will certainly want safety . They will want to know who is going to deter whatever threat they still feel from the missiles and bombers of others . <P> Kohl 's answer is NATO . His Camp David host , George Bush , agrees . They both &lt; believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't fix it . " NATO has kept the peace for 40 years , and there 's no reason to believe it ca n't do so for another 40 . <P> The trouble is , NATO is broken , at least conceptually . Its reason for being was to deter the Soviet Union from launching an invasion through West Germany to the English Channel . With that danger diminished to the vanishing point , NATO is already undergoing its own deconstruction , more subtle , dignified and gradual than that of the Warsaw Pact but in the long run just as relentless . <P> Whatever Kohl says now , it is highly unlikely that after unification his citizens or their parliamentary representatives will welcome either American nuclear weapons or soldiers on their soil at more than token levels and for more than a transitional period . For their part , U.S. Congressmen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are unenthusiastic about sending combat units overseas to serve as political symbols  --  and temporary ones at that . So the only real suspense in the next stage of the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American troops or the U.S. brings them home first .
