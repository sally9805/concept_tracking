His name is Jim Mauro . He 's the senior editor of this magazine . He 's 33 years old , a conservative in everything from his politics to his neckties , and keeps his emotions pretty close to the chest . So I felt nothing short of total shock when I managed to talk him into undergoing Mt . Sinai 's battery of diagnostic tests . Part of our deal was , even though the results threatened to reveal the innermost secrets of Tim 's personality , he had to publish them , regardless of their content . The future implications of this research suggest that the dialogue between doctor and patient may include a chemical prognosis before conversation ever begins in earnest . Clearly , this was a serious experiment , but it was downright fun watching Jim wait for his results . About six months ago , in response to our article on Prozac and the new antidepressants " The Transformation of Personality " ; July/August , I began to wonder whether the tremendous advances in diagnostic techniques and prescriptive medicine held any promise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder , but who nevertheless sometimes feel recurrent " aftershocks " from one or another of life 's little curveballs . Would there someday be a test , for instance , whereby T could walk into a physician 's office , announce that I 'd been feeling out of sorts for the past , oh , two or three months , and be given an accurate diagnosis , complete with recommended treatment ( medication in combination with therapy ) that would have a 90-whatever percent chance to improve my condition ? That 's how I got roped into the offbeat idea of going through the battery of psychophysiological , biological , and neurological tests developed by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health , the Mt . Sinai School of Medicine , and the Bronx VA Medical Center . It 's a program normally reserved for people with actual personality disorders . Not for okay guys like me . When I agreed to be evaluated I also agreed to an important codicil : Whatever the results , I had to publish them . Should the tests reveal some secret strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to report it . There was no backing out once the process had begun . ( Since I will be writing this as a journal , I have no idea at this point what the findings will reveal about me . Perhaps life 's events have taken their toll ; perhaps the way I sort my socks is evidence of some disorder not immediately apparent but waiting , like Banquo 's ghost , to strike on a specific cue . ) No matter how healthy I think I am , there is a nagging suspicion on my part that these tests may " find something . " As I 've discovered , one does n't ever fully recover from divorce , for example , and perhaps the mental prosthetics I 've developed to compensate have been inadequate . In any case , I 'm prepared for anything . At the very least , since the program requires numerous intravenous injections and blood samples , I suspect I 'll lose my phobia of hypodermic needles . TUESDAY , SEPTEMBER 28 TEST #1 : COMPLETE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND MOOD PROFILE The Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed neighborhood . Inside , it 's a hospital like every other  --  filled with the sick and the frantic . Mina Apovian and Irene Lopez are two researchers who work with Drs . Larry Siever and Bob Trestman in the psychiatric division . Fielding the questions posed by the two young , attractive women is uncomfortable at times . Mina asks me my height and weight , marital status , whether and how much I drink or smoke , and if there 's any history of mental illness in my family . I feel like I 'm on a very intense first date . An intern enters the room and examines me , draws a blood sample for what seems like forever ( while I 'm lying down so I do n't faint ) , and asks me to fill not one but two cups with urine ( my own , I assume ) . Then she tells me that for the next two weeks ( the duration of the testing protocol ) , I can not drink alcohol or coffee ( two of my four favorite food groups ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not depressed already , I will be by a week from Saturday , when I finish up the program with a CAT scan . I end the day with an EKG ( electrocardiogram ) on a cold metal table with what look like jumper cables attached to my chest and belly . When the nurse asks me which department sent me and I answer " psychiatry , " the look on her face changes . Even the technician keeps a closer eye on me . THURSDAY , SEPTEMBER 30 TEST #2 : SELF-REPORT SCALES The Klingenstein Building at Mt . Sinai seems a bit more forgiving in its overall demeanor  --  perhaps because the donut shop located right in its lobby suggests you 're merely taking a short commuter ride rather than a long journey to recovery . In a ridiculously small room , spartan as a nun 's boudoir , a research assistant asks me question after question from a 50+page document  --  questions ranging from my childhood ( " Did I have many friends ? Did I have a best friend ? " ) , through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I drink/use drugs ? " ) , and into adulthood ( " Have I ever felt unusually up/down for a period of more than one week ? Did I sleep/eat/work/have sex more or less during that time ? " ) A lot of the questions are vague and difficult to answer  --  how does one know when one is feeling " unusually up or down " ? When I answer that I have many ups and downs ( especially when the Mets are playing ) , he gives me a quizzical look . " But they do n't last long , " I hurry to explain . " And they 're not really " up " ups or " down " downs . " It occurs to me then that I 'm trying to " pass " the test , as though there were such a thing . When it 's over , he mumbles a few sentences , shakes my hand , and hustles me out . I feel like I 've blown it , but I 'm not sure what " it " is . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING The maddening thing about these evaluations is how repetitive the questions are : " How am I feeling how have I been feeling any trouble sleeping ? " I go through the usual answers , feeling the same reluctance to reveal so much of myself to yet another stranger . Rachel DuPre , a research assistant , administers several tests that I later learn are called Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement ( SPEM ) , Backward Masking ( BM ) , and Continuous Performance Task ( CPT ) . All three are designed to measure my levels of attention and impulsivity  --  the idea being that certain personality disordered patients have trouble with both . Basically , it means I 'm either visually following Xs across a computer screen ( SPEM ) , identifying letters flashed briefly on a screen before another pattern of Xs ( BM ) , or identifying matching sets of numbers and shapes by pressing a button whenever two in a row appear on another monitor ( CPT ) . On a descriptive pamphlet for these tests , the warning reads : " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than boredom . " It gets interesting , though , when , during the last CPT , as I 'm identifying matching shapes and four-digit numbers , the image on the screen grows distorted and Rachel starts playing a tape behind my head . The room is dark , and I 'm reminded briefly of that scene from The Right Stuff when Dennis Quaid is in some kind of giant test tube and the lights go out , smoke enters , and a horn blows loudly . Before the interruptions , Quaid , like me , is ready to fall asleep . Only then Rachel starts asking me questions about the dialogue I heard on the tape , which only registered in my head as a scene from It Happened One Night with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert . The object of the test is , you 're supposed to divide your attention between the voices on the tape and the numbers/shapes . It 's challenging , and I can only imagine some patients getting up and running from the room , as Quaid 's partner did in Stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the tests . " That 's exactly what some patients do . They get so frustrated , they just walk out . " I do n't . I stick around and finish them . Because I 'm normal , right ? Rachel does n't answer . WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY , OCTOBER 6 AND 8 TESTS #4 &; 5 : D-AMPHETAMINE CHALLENGE ( AND PLACEBO ) Now it gets interesting . And painful . At 8 A.M. T show up at Bronx VA , get in a hospital bed , and have an N catheter shoved up my arm . Mina comes in and asks me more personal questions , and I feel like I 'm on a very intense second date  --  blood tests and all . In fact , they 'll draw blood from me five times aver the next six hours . At 10 o'clock , another doctor comes in and gives me a cup of orange juice that may or may not contain amphetamine ( like I would n't know ) . I have to go through this twice , you see  --  once with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another researcher , enters and begins neuropsychological testing on me : the Wisconsin Card Sort Test , the California Verbal Learning Test , more mood scales , more personal questions . Suddenly , the TV does n't bother me as much . I scan the Daily News in about 20 seconds and edit an article in 2.3 minutes . You know , IVs are really fascinating , if you think about it . So are hospitals . This program really is n't so bad after all  --  nice people , tasty orange juice , Clark Gable .... I think I got the amphetamine today . I 'm whipping through the cards and words now , and on a mood test I recognize that my answers are a little brighter than they were a couple of hours ago . Of course , the main objective of this challenge is to test whether or not the amphetamine will stimulate the production of growth hormone , which may indicate the level of activity in my norepinephrine system , which may play a role in influencing personality traits such as impulsivity ( see " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end , Irene takes more and more blood out of my arm , replacing it with cold saline , and after a while I feel good and miserable again . Then they let me go home . TUESDAY , OCTOBER 12 TEST #6 : SPECT ( SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ) Now that I 've taken amphetamine , I 'm ready to move on to radiation . Excuse me ? Radiation ? I meet Mina at 1 o'clock in the Nuclear Medicine department of Bronx VA , a section of the hospital that looks as foreboding as it sounds . There , another patient and I sit down , roll up our sleeves , and accept yet another IV into our veins . Clara Schaeffer , Ph.D. , stands behind a screen and administers Ceretec , a low-level radiopharmaceutical , while I 'm performing the Wisconsin Card Sort Test ( WCST ) on a computer . The WCST is a frustrating little game in which there are no rules . Basically , you sort cards of different colors , shapes , and numbers of shapes in a trial-and-error fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes shapes , sometimes number of shapes . The computer tells you if your choice is right or wrong . Then it changes the rules on you , and you have to figure out all over again which cards go where . The computer does this a number of times throughout the test , and while I 'm busy figuring it out , the Ceretec is attaching itself to the areas of my brain that are being used , which will then show up on the SPECT . After I finish , Dr. Schaeffer puts my head in the Tomomatic , which looks like a big hair dryer for guys named Tom but is really an elaborate camera that takes pictures of my brain . Half an hour later , eight images appear on a computer screen  --  each a different slice of my brain . The areas in red are where activity has taken place . Past research with psychiatric patients who are impulsively aggressive showed reduced activity in the front and left regions of the brain . My nice distribution of Ceretec lets me off the hook there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before anything can be stated conclusively . FRIDAY , OCTOBER 15 TEST #7 : FENFLURAMINE CHALLENGE My final needle , and sort of the big finish as far as these tests go ( aside from a quick CAT scan tomorrow morning ) . The " fen , " as it 's known , is thought to be an accurate indicator of serotonin activity in the brain ( see page 43 ) , so it 's perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this program in light of newer serotonin-inhibiting drugs such as Prozac , Zoloft , and Paxil  --  all of which selectively alter the amount of serotonin made available in the brain . Neurotransmitters such as serotonin are active when they sit in the gap , or synapse , between nerve cells in the brain . Transmission is ended when the chemical is taken back up into the transmitting cell . Drugs such as Prozac , et al , act as antidepressants by slowing this reuptake of serotonin , making it more available to the receiving cell and prolonging its effect on the brain . The trick is , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do react to the drugs range from " some improvement " to " complete transformation " of personality . Once again I crawl into a hospital bed at 7:45 A.M. while a nurse works an IV catheter into my arm . This time there 'll be no neuropsych tests , just mood self-report scales every hour throughout the day and more questions from Damon . Oh yeah  --  and blood will be drawn 12 times from my rapidly depleted arm : every 15 minutes for the first hour and then every half hour after that , until 3 o'clock when the test is over . Terrific . I notice only subtle changes in my mood throughout the course of the test  --  some of them , I suspect , having more to do with Oprah , Sally , Phil , and their guests ( the TV perched above the bed gets only local stations , and I 'm not allowed to sleep ) . I do get more tense and grumpy , but my arm is starting to hurt , I 'm hungry ( no eating , either ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head ( this is my last day on the diet regimen ) . The consent form for this test warns that the medication 's side effects may include nausea and depression . I feel neither , but then I 'm looking forward to getting out of this bed more than the Birdman wanted out of Alcatraz . On my way home , the experience hits me  --  hard . My head feels expanded , full of pressure and hammering pain . The sunlight burns my eyes ; even after they adjust from the hospital 's fluorescents it still hurts to look at things . I pass a record store and the rap music sounds unbearable ( even more than usual ) . The smell from a hot-dog vendor makes me so nauseated I literally double over and hold back the vomit . In my apartment , I have to draw the blinds and lie down . Dr. Siever 's description of the experience of certain mental disorders as similar to a powerful stereo playing a beat-up album seems appropriate : Is this what some forms of mental illness feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fen test is an accurate measure of serotonin activity in the brain ; and if low serotonin activity indicates that a drug such as Prozac would be beneficial in alleviating distress ( by prolonging the effects of whatever amount there is ) ; and if depressed patients actually do respond well in significant numbers  --  then a great deal of guesswork might soon be eliminated regarding treatment for these patients , and Siever and his colleagues may really be on to something . RESULTS Written Evaluation Form : " This is an essentially normal profile except for the presence of a depressive episode earlier this year and a dysthymic episode in 1990-91 ( although not enduring enough to meet criteria for dysthymia ) . The self-report scales were normal , with the depression inventory showing no elevation . While at the margins of the normal range , the slightly elevated scores on the Hostility Index and Impulsivity Scale are compatible with a tendency to internalize or hold in hostility and anger , which may be associated with a susceptibility to depression . " This could be seen as a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to direct aggression towards themselves , and who tend to have both reduced responses to serotonergic and norepinephrine challenges . " The psychophysiologic tests were all normal , demonstrating excellent attention and information processing . There was perfect recognition on the Backward Masking test , no errors on the Continuous Performance Test , normal eye tracking , faster than normal completion of trials A and B. The vocabulary subscale test score was high , consistent with high verbal intelligence , but the block design was only average . This kind of differential is often seen in depression , but is not diagnostic . The Wisconsin Card Sort is normal although there were a few errors . " On the D-amphetamine , the error rate was lower on the WCST ; there were no pronounced psychologic changes on amphetamine although slight increases in suspiciousness and guilt and a reduction in depression . There was slight reduction in mood on the fenfluramine challenge , though the prolactin response was normal . " Verbally , Dr. Siever describes me as " disgustingly normal . " But there 's more , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  some things I suspected and others I did n't . First off , there 's some degree of depression , meaning that I fall in the " high end of the norm , " as Siever puts it . I also scored higher than average in anhedonia  --  the inability to experience pleasure in pleasurable or experiences . And I tend to react less intensely to both good and bad experiences . The most cheery way to look at this is that I am steady . A less sympathetic observer might say I 'm a little insulated . I prefer the former . Oddly , I tend to internalize anger while at the same time I scored above the norm on measures of hostility . Which means that the person I may beat up the most is myself . I 'm is more deliberate in my manner than many  --  a thinker , a planner , a muller-over of every angle before I take action . ( Like writing this article ? ) Basically , the findings shed new light on some aspects of my character while confirming old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the tests that Larry Siever and other top researchers are working on , perhaps even the word " physical , " when it regards health examinations , will be phased out . Given the current emphasis on prevention , it seems outdated already that physical and mental status are not now programmed into our routine checkups . What we need to recognize is that with newer medications that can pinpoint specific functions of the brain while leaving others virtually untouched , more and more of us may find our family doctors writing out prescriptions rather than ( or in addition to ) the name of a therapist in response to our psychological complaints . That 's scary to a lot of people , of course . Overprescription is a genuine fear , as is the unreal expectation that a pill can completely replace the therapist 's couch . Yet if certain drugs allow patients to begin their therapy at Point L or M rather than Point A by alleviating a good deal of initial distress ; if they arm patients with the proper tools they currently lack to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing process  --  then we may all benefit . And medical practice may be heading in the right direction . Editor 's Note : As for Boy Scout Jim , I have to report here that his test results were eerily on target  --  a slightly-too-accurate schematic of a guy who 's something of an enigma around here . In fact , the curiosity with which the other editors awaited the findings resembled a barroom betting pool . ( The final odds , I believe , for Jim needing Prozac were running something like 6 to 4 against . ) He 's also better company these days . A little indisputable self-knowledge goes a long way . At least some of his innermost secrets are exposed now for himself ; the staff  --  and the readers of this magazine . So much for keeping things close to his vest . <p>
