<p> LAS VEGAS - After all the robbing was done , after his 3 1/2-month dash from the law ended in a fateful traffic stop , the thing that bothered Jimmie Hays the most was that the cops would n't let him kiss his teen-age sweetheart , Shannon Ludington , goodbye . <p> They just slapped handcuffs on the 29-year-old divorced meat packer and the 17-year-old high school basketball star and hauled them off to jail . Soon they will be transported back to Texas on arrest warrants for kidnapping , auto theft and robbery . <p> " All we wanted , " a hollow-eyed Hays said this week in a jailhouse interview , " was to spend our lives together . " <p> The couple , both from the small town of Panhandle , Texas , met in November through his sister and her brother , who had become engaged and since have married . <p> In the clarity of hindsight , Hays admitted the chances of their romance surviving the yawning age gap and the stern disapproval of both sets of parents were minute at best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clandestine meetings and all-night telephone conversations - they were blinded by love . <p> " We had joked about leaving and living on a beach in Mexico , " Hays said . " We had laughed about it . But doing it was a spur-of-the-moment thing . We did n't decide to do it until five minutes before we left . We left so fast that we did n't even pick up my last paycheck . We were in love , and love makes you do crazy things . " <p> Ludington was being held in a facility for juveniles , and authorities would not allow an interview request to be made to her . <p> On the afternoon of Feb. 23 , as the pair sped south to Lubbock in Hays ' beat-up Buick sedan , the one-time Panhandle football hero confided to Ludington that he might have " to do some things " to finance their flight . <p> The first thing they did was rob a Lubbock deputy sheriff , an old acquaintance of Hays ' , of a 9 mm semiautomatic and a .22-caliber target pistol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull robberies , " he said , " and the only other person I knew had them was my stepfather . I could n't bring myself to steal from him . " <p> If Ludington was alarmed at the turn of events , she concealed it , Hays said . The couple drove into New Mexico , then cut across to El Paso . <p> " We drove forever , then sat around in El Paso , " Hays said . " I kind of put a plan together in my head . I knew we could n't stay in Texas . " <p> The plan was to raise funds through robbery , then retire to southern Mexico until the heat faded . Hays reckoned $ 30,000 would be sufficient to keep them in style . <p> " I told Shannon that all I needed was one big hit , " he said . " She never was involved in the robberies . " <p> Somehow , though , the plan never quite worked out . <p> As the pair meandered through the West - Colorado , Utah , Nevada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hays said he pulled small jobs every couple of weeks , but declined to say how many such crimes he committed . <p> " They 've been saying on TV and in the papers that we were Bonnie and Clyde , " Hays said . " It was n't anything like that at all . . . <p> " I did n't want to get shot , and I certainly did n't want to shoot anyone . I never leveled my gun at anyone . I just showed where it was tucked in my pants . " <p> Sometimes the victims - proprietors of outlet mall shops or movie ticket booths - would hand over the cash . Sometimes they would just laugh , Hays said . In the latter case , Hays said he would beat a hasty retreat with as much dignity as he could muster . <p> On April 1 , Hays said , he and Ludington kidnapped an Amarillo car salesman , Gil Reeves , during a test drive at an auto dealership . <p> " I know he was scared , " Hays said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I told him we 'd call the sheriff and get him set free . " <p> Reeves , left bound to a tree about 100 miles east of Amarillo , was unhurt in the episode . Hays said he did call the sheriff as promised , but authorities said Reeves was discovered by a farmer before the call was made . <p> As the weeks dragged by , the couple spent their time bowling , playing miniature golf and watching movies . Their dream of a Mexican beach began to fade . <p> " I knew that I would have to rob a bank , " he said . " And I scoped some out . But every time I did , I always saw an armed guard there . I knew that if I tried to rob a bank , there was going to be gunplay , and I did n't want that . " <p> Beyond his qualms about violence , Hays said , the couple found that leaving the United States would be difficult without documents . " When we were in San Diego , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't do it without passports or whatever and Shannon did n't have any identification at all . <p> " It was a short-sighted situation we were in , " he conceded . " But once the ball starts rolling , you ca n't stop . " <p> Hays contends his criminal career left him feeling guilty . A one-time Abilene Christian University history major , Hays had been brought up in a strict household . The family attended Church of Christ services three times weekly . <p> " Twice on Sunday , " Hays said . " Those people are in no way to blame for what I became . Yes , I felt guilty , but I would do anything for Shannon . I just did n't want to lose her . I did all of this for love . I wish you could understand that . This was not a joy ride . " <p> Hays said he often fretted that he would " ruin Shannon 's life , " and , from a brief job he held at the Lubbock County Jail , he knew well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know what jail is like , " he said . " It 's a hellhole . Screaming . Fights . Jesus knows what else . " <p> The couple wound up spending the past month here . <p> " It was cheap , " he said of Las Vegas . " You could get a good clean room for $ 25 . Not any $ 100 room . We enjoyed it here . " <p> Occasionally , he said , they attempted to increase their stake by playing blackjack at the town 's casinos . But mainly they hung out . " We 'd go bowl 10 games at a time , " he said . <p> Last Friday afternoon , they were making their way back to their room at the Showboat Hotel , Casino and Bowling Center with a takeout meal from Taco Bell when they were intercepted by police for an expired license plate . <p> They were still driving the Jeep Grand Cherokee stolen from the Amarillo dealership . <p> " I thought about running for it , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She grabbed my hand . I could tell the cops recognized me . When they told me to step out of the car , I knew it was over . He was reaching for his gun . " <p> " They would n't let me kiss her goodbye , " he said . " They cuffed me , and then got her out of the car and cuffed her . " <p> They were put in separate patrol cars . " She said , ' I love you . ' I said , ' I love you , too . ' <p> " I could see there was a tear rolling down her cheek . <p> " Then they took her away . " <p>
