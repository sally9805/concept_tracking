Parking : free valet or street . <p> Now that the streets of Chicago are running red ( and white and green ) with the sauces from a zillion Italian restaurants , watch for a culinary counterattack from the bistro boys . Rumor is that Lettuce Entertain You , a.k.a . Richard Melman , has plans to open a French bistro ( a few years ago , stringing those two words together would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ( Cafe Brulee ? Chez Joe ? Bistro La Bouche ? ) next spring . <p> Melman knows when to fold ' em and when to hold ' em . When Sir Richard says " bistro , " you can bet there 's a trend just around the bend , so you will soon be hearing cassoulets bubbling and brulees burning in every room of the castle . <p> But this bodes well for the bistro scene already in place . The current fever and passion for Italian food was caused largely by the sheer number of Italian restaurants that opened , giving these restaurants  --  old and new  --  a presence as imposing as Mt . Vesuvius . I predict that bistro ( the very word suggesting simple , casual , inexpensive ) will erupt in the same way . <p> The only question in my mind is size . Mr. Melman does not like to do small restaurants ( the return on investment is too slow and small ) , so how big will his bistro be ? Big bistro is an oxymoron . Little bistro sounds nicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is very , very nice . Slightly off the trodden culinary path at the edge of the River North neighborhood , Kiki 's Bistro has been steadily winning over the stomachs of people looking for real bistro food in a real bistro atmosphere . <p> Kiki 's is bistro every which way you measure it . Just as the owners of French bistros are imposing presences , Kiki 's owner Georges Cuisance is M. Everywhere , as he seats patrons , checks a tablecloth fold , positions a knife or fork more precisely and chats with customers . He is , in fact , a classic example of a French restaurant owner . <p> And in every other way , Kiki 's has all the right goods . It 's inexpensive yet interesting , small yet comfortable , casual yet appropriate ( I 've seen sandals and I 've seen silk , I 've seen jackets and I 've seen jeans ) , spirited yet sensibly ordered . Underneath it all , the restaurant is pleasantly comfortable ( if you 're in need of a quiet spot for lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , a quiet refuge . <p> A small bar as you enter sets the bistro scene , as do the wood floor , the fresh table flowers and the pleasant but not solicitous service staff , who are neatly clad in classic bistro attire ( white shirt , tie , vest , long white apron ) . The wine list , too , follows the bistro profile , offering a nice selection of French and California wines at a price range that accommodates big spenders and little spenders ( and those in between ) with equal consideration . <p> On the food end of things , Cuisance has complete confidence in his man in the kitchen  --  John Hogan , who cut his carrots at the illustrious Everest Room ( 440 S. La Salle ) . And well he should , as Hogan has a firm grip on what bistro fare should be and carries it out with a je ne sais quoi that is most pleasing . <p> Oxtail soup provided a good example . The fact that it was even on the specials menu pleased me immensely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slickness that was most pleasing ) studded with pieces of tender meat , the tiniest cuts of asparagus tips and scallions was enough to win me over . <p> Other bistro classics abounded : plump snails sizzling in a Pernod-laced garlic butter ( $ 5.95 ) ; a rich and satisfying duck pate ( $ 5.75 ) studded with pistachios ( I love to smear this over the small rounds of delicious French bread that is freely dispensed ) ; rosemary-scented potato salad and zesty grilled lamb sausage ( $ 5.95 ) . And that 's just a sampling of the appetizers . <p> But all is not cooked by the classic bistro cookbook alone . I like the way Hogan blends classic bistro with modern bistro  --  a la mode meets au courant , I suppose . It shows up in the daily pizza specials , a super-thin-crust model that is just the right size for two to share as a first course . A recent encounter was a rabbit sausage , spinach and taleggio cheese affair that was very good , though the saltiness of the cheese threw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple arrangement of big and little red and yellow tomatoes  --  thickly sliced beefsteaks and miniature pear-shaped  --  glossed with a light balsamic vinaigrette and perfumed with fresh basil . <p> Another modern-day bistro dish , enjoyed at lunch one day , was a grilled breast of chicken with guacamole and spicy corn relish . It was not a dish you 'd likely find in a bistro in , say , Paris , but it roused the dickens out of my taste buds . <p> Returning to the classics , a fine example of bistro came forth with the steak pommes frites ( $ 13.95 ) . The steak was a thin butt cut , which got the simple and delicious French treatment  --  grilled and buttered . Coasting along with the steak was a haystack of frites  --  almost matchstick-sized fries that were almost impossible to stop eating . It was a great dish . <p> Another steak classic was the steak au poivre . A strip steak was literally embedded with coarsely cracked black peppercorns , pan-fried and served with a light yet lavish Cognac cream sauce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrots , shaped potatoes and green beans , it was a tasty and excellent dish for only $ 15.95 . <p> And on the fish side of things , a pan-roasted salmon fillet topped with a strip of fluffy whipped potatoes and embraced by a flavorful beurre rouge , or red butter sauce , was perfect in every way . <p> Desserts are bistro to the core , and all that we sampled were excellent . The apples in the tarte tatin were chunky , soft ( but not mushy ) and perfectly spiced . A poached pear on crisp puff pastry , topped with slivered almonds and sitting in a pool of caramel sauce was eating-sweet dynamite . Similarly , a nougat glace ( frozen meringue filled with dried fruit and nuts ) served with a sauce cassis was like eating a luxuriously made candy bar . <p> And something as basic as a lemon tart had all the right lemon bells ( properly tart ) and tart whistles ( tender crust ) . <p> If you catch Kiki 's Bistro now , you 'll be able to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Friday in WeekendPlus : Readers move their tail to tell Pat Bruno about their favorite places for lobster tails . @x HEATH SHULER KNOWS HOW TO make a splash when he comes to Washington . He began his first stint in the nation 's capital as quarterback for the Washington Redskins , the third overall pick in the 1994 NFL draft . Shuler held out on training camp until he was awarded a seven-year , $19.25 million contract . Shuler seemed to attract nearly as much attention when he returned to Washington as a congressman from North Carolina . After he unseated eight-term Republican congressman Charles Taylor in 2006 , Democrats celebrated Shuler as proof their party could win again in Southern , culturally conservative areas . No congressional district was safe from the emerging Democratic majority . But Shuler held out on his new team too : the pro-life , pro-gun , anti-amnesty evangelical Christian promised to buck House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's leadership on a regular basis . Conservatives held him up as evidence that conservatism was n't to blame for the GOP 's recent drubbings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , the Democratic congressional leadership probably wishes it could do the same thing . During the stimulus debate , Shuler said publicly that Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid " failed " to act in a bipartisan manner . He voted against the package both times . Reid 's office did not hide its displeasure . The majority leader 's spokesman cracked , " Let me get this straight- this is coming from a guy who threw more than twice as many interceptions as touchdowns ? " Reid 's man is right about his football statistics . During four seasons in the NFL , Shuler threw 32 interceptions while recording just 15 touchdowns , completing fewer than half his passes for an abysmal 54.3 lifetime passer rating . It remains to be seen whether he will enjoy more success in his latest team sport : trying to keep Capitol Hill Democrats from veering too far to the left . In 2006 , the party 's national leaders valued Democrats like Shuler . They do n't need them as much now that their majorities are bigger . Shuler today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue Dog Coalition , a group of 51 centrist to conservative Democrats who mostly hail from districts where it 's not easy for a dyed-in-the-wool liberal to beat a generic Republican . With Republicans almost completely shut out of power , business groups and some conservative interests have been looking at the Blue Dogs as the last line of defense against Reid , Pelosi , and President Barack Obama . The Blue Dog Political Action Committee nearly doubled its fundraising haul in 2008 over the midterm elections , approaching the top of congressional PACs . By the fall of last year , it had collected more than $2.3 million , including $455,800 from the health care industry , $440,500 from the financial sector , and $150,000 from traditionally Republican agribusiness . Individual Blue Dogs fared even better : according to the Center for Responsive Politics , they raised $7.5 million from finance , $3.8 million from health care , and $3.7 million from the agricultural sector . Even the National Rifle Association ponied up , giving nearly $5,000 to the Blue Dog PAC in 2008 . " We 've supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " NRA Institute for Legislative Action executive director Chris Cox told Roll Call last year . Cox himself is a former aide to Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee , a top Blue Dog rainmaker . A BKSH &; Associates lobbyist quoted in the same story said of the Blue Dogs , " Much of corporate Washington has glommed onto them like white on rice . " The Blue Dogs have plenty of friends and alumni in high places . Former Blue Dog chairman Charles Stenholm , a longtime conservative Democratic congressman from Texas , is a K Street lobbyist affiliated with Olsson Frank Weeda . Others are ensconced in different high-powered firms . And in the last Congress , they held the balance of power- serving members of the Blue Dog Coalition exceeded the Democrats ' margin in the House . They had the ear of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Rahm Emanuel , now the White House chief of staff . They were well funded , well covered by the press , and well placed to affect legislative outcomes . Until Obama 's coattails grew the Democratic majority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the legislative process in the House . Observes Christopher Hayes , Washington editor of the Nation , " in the 111th Congress , the Democrats ' margin is big enough to pass legislation without a single Republican or Blue Dog vote . " Perhaps that 's why the Speaker of the House often takes them as seriously as her Senate counterpart takes Heath Shuler 's professional football record . " Speaking of the Blue Dogs , " a reporter began a question at Pelosi 's weekly press conference . " Were we speaking about them ? " she replied , according to Politico . The first sign of the moderates ' relative weakness appeared before the new Congress was even sworn in . Rep. John Dingell of Michigan was squaring off against Rep. Henry Waxman of California for chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . Although the Blue Dog Coalition did n't take an official position ( that requires a two-thirds vote of the members ) , most of them were backing Dingell because Waxman was too far to the left on environmental regulation . Yet Waxman won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most senior House Democrat , has built more than 50 years of political alliances in Washington . The Blue Dogs ' ranks were augmented by the votes of many Congressional Black Caucus members and those of other Democrats interested in preserving seniority for committee chairs . If the moderates could n't prevail within the Democratic caucus under those conditions , it is hard to see when they could do so . OF COURSE , the Blue Dogs do n't have to carry the day inside the Democratic caucus when they can add their votes to unanimously opposed Republicans . Consider moderate misgivings about the stimulus . " I got in terrible trouble with our leadership because they do n't care what 's in the bill ; they just want it to pass and they want it to be unanimous , " Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee complained on a Nashville radio program . " We 're just treated like mushrooms most of the time . " Some Blue Dogs pressed for substantive concessions , like pay-go rules requiring all tax cuts and spending increases to be offset by tax hikes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House " fiscal responsibility summit . " Either way , the Blue Dogs ' bark proved worse than their bite . They accepted that their proposed budget rules would never be applied to the stimulus package , despite its $1 trillion price tag ( counting interest ) . Then they were willing to settle for a vote on those rules rather than their passage . True , more than half the Blue Dogs sided against their party 's leadership after receiving only token assurances on their rules change ( though nearly as many Blue Dogs voted with the leadership ) . But only six of their members plus one additional Democrat from a conservative district bothered to vote against the precompromise stimulus bill . " We did n't want to embarrass the president , " Rep. Charlie Melancon of Louisiana , a Blue Dog cochairman , explained to reporters . So they got letters reaffirming the administration 's support for pay-go . They got their late February fiscal responsibility summit ( with entitlement reform mostly taken off the agenda ) . But at the price of helping pass an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and likely swell the annual budget deficit to $1.9 trillion . After the compromise with the Senate , which cut $100 billion in House spending only after senators added a comparable amount of their own largesse , the number of Democrats opposing the stimulus fell from 11 to seven . One of those Democrats , Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon , opposed the package from the left because it contained too many tax cuts and too little spending . The other six no votes , like Shuler , came from relatively conservative- and comparatively unsafedistricts . Leading Blue Dogs like Melancon and Cooper , the man who did n't want to be treated like a mushroom , joined the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues in voting yes . Maybe they will have more muscle in upcoming debates over health care and card check . Moderates may also be heeded in debates over social issues , like taxpayer funding of abortion , since they represent the districts most likely to fall to Republicans in the next unfavorable election cycle . But so far , business groups have n't seen much return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it continues to resemble Shuler 's Redskins contract , it will be one costly bust .
