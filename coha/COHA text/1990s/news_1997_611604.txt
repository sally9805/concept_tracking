<p> U.S. oil companies got an unpleasant surprise on Sept. 24 when the government of Kazakhstan unexpectedly sold a controlling interest in its second-largest oil field to a new player in the international energy game : the Chinese National Petroleum Co . <p> Aggressive bidding by Beijing 's state oil company on the $ 4.4 billion deal was reinforced by repeated phone calls to Kazakhstan 's president from Chinese Premier Li Peng , who more than matched extensive lobbying efforts led by Vice President Gore on behalf of U.S. bidders . <p> The Chinese leader 's personal involvement , the use of government funds to sweeten the bidding and the offer to build two multibillion-dollar pipelines as part of the deal signaled a new determination by Beijing in pursuing its economic interests abroad  --  even when that means paying top dollar and risking political fallout in other capitals , according to U.S. officials and international trade experts . <p> China 's booming economy and rapid industrialization mean , " pure and simple , they need oil , " said Ming Wan , a China-born international affairs specialist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of post-Cold War battleground on which three old military rivals  --  China , Russia and the United States  --  vie for markets and access to resources . But the larger issue for U.S. officials is whether China 's vigorous approach to securing energy supplies over the last 18 months  --  in Iraq , Iran , Sudan and Venezuela , as well as Kazakhstan  --  indicates a new Chinese mercantilism that will butt up against American commercial interests . <p> U.S. officials publicly have welcomed China 's involvement in the oil-rich Caspian Sea region of Central Asia , noting that Chinese investments will help diversify the world 's oil market and lessen dependence on the volatile Middle East . " The Chinese need to have access to the vast energy supplies in the Caspian region , " Energy Secretary Federico Pena said during a recent international conference in Washington . <p> Yet China 's tactics could pose future problems for American companies , according to Jeffrey E. Garten , undersecretary of commerce for international trade from 1993 to 1995 . Chinese officials , Garten said , told him they will do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key industries competitive in world markets . <p> " They want the world to make room for them at the top . They do n't want to wait , " said Garten , now dean of the Yale University School of Management . " In Chinese minds , their strategic advantage is that they can out-subsidize us . Their prices are going to be lower . " <p> Top Chinese officials have made no bones about their intentions . " We are going to take advantage of our strength to participate in global oil and gas exploration , " Zhou Yongkang , president of the Chinese oil company , told a Houston conference earlier this year . <p> In the Kazakh oil competition , a Chinese promise to build pipelines not only to China but also to Iran added a provision that private U.S. oil companies could not match . " This adds a new level to the game , " said Sheila Heslin , a former National Security Council economic specialist . <p> Whether China 's foray into Kazakhstan , a country long part of the Soviet Union and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benign economic globalization is uncertain . But Beijing has displayed an increasing willingness to use the Chinese National Petroleum Co. to challenge U.S. and European oil giants around the world . <p> Since becoming a net importer of oil and refined products in 1993 , China has tried to tap new sources of oil and gas in several countries that the United States has sought to isolate economically . These include Iran , Iraq and Sudan , all of which are on a U.S. blacklist of countries alleged to support terrorism or to be building weapons of mass destruction . <p> As part of the proposal that enabled China to beat out such American companies as Amoco , Unocal , Texaco and Exxon for oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan , Beijing promised not only a $ 3.5 billion , 1,800-mile oil pipeline to China but also a pipeline to refineries in northern Iran . While providing a southern export outlet for the former Soviet republic , that route would collide with U.S. policy aimed at preventing the construction of new pipelines from the Caspian Sea to or through Iran . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint venture with the National Iranian Oil Co. to explore offshore in Iran , China and other countries and to upgrade Chinese refineries for purposes of processing more Iranian oil . <p> In June , China signed a $ 1.2 billion agreement with Iraq to develop its Ahdab field once U.N . sanctions against Baghdad are lifted . And last year China replaced the the U.S. firm Occidental Petroleum Corp . in a $ 1 billion oil and pipeline deal in Sudan after Congress barred U.S. companies from dealing with countries accused of supporting terrorism . <p> China 's developing commercial ties with Iran and Iraq put it on a potential collision course with Washington . In the U.N . Security Council , China has supported an early end to U.S.-backed sanctions against Iraq . And Beijing has clashed with the Clinton administration over Beijing 's sale of anti-ship missiles to Iran . " Depending on Iran is no way to meet China 's need for reliable energy supplies , " said Commerce Department counselor Jan H. Kalicki , an administration spokesman on Caspian oil issues . <p> But American experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the corporate ambitions of China 's national oil company and the national security concerns of China 's political and military leadership , " Daniel Yergin , president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , wrote recently . <p> China 's domestic oil production peaked at about 3 million barrels a day several years ago  --  about one-sixth of daily use in the United States . Hopes for finding a substantial oil patch in China 's vast Western deserts so far have failed to be realized . As a result , the country 's oil import needs are certain to grow steadily in the years ahead . <p> But depending on established international oil companies would undercut what some experts describe as the Chinese leadership 's deep-rooted instinct for self-reliance , nurtured during decades of isolation . <p> The state oil company has invested in or conducted exploration in 23 countries . It bid more than $ 350 million to win rights to restore two marginal fields in Venezuela  --  outbidding American firms by $ 100 million . It also formed a joint venture with the Italian oil company Agip and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its offshore drilling arm has moved into joint exploration in Southeast Asia . <p> The latest commercial triumph , Kazakhstan , will be one of China 's main oil sources and supply 200,000 barrels a day by 2000 , according to official announcements . On Oct. 21 , the first trainload of oil from China 's Kazakh holdings headed toward Chinese refineries across what until recently had been one of the most tightly shut borders in the world . <p> That oil was the first payoff from China 's newly won concessions at Uzen and Aktyubinsk in western Kazakhstan , both of which had been coveted by major U.S. oil companies . <p> In the case of the Uzen field , bids by Amoco and Unocal were supported by phone calls to top Kazakh officials from Gore and Commerce Secretary William Daley . Although Amoco officials said their company was the front-runner , China ended up winning a 51 percent share with the Kazakh state oil company keeping the balance . <p> The Chinese won the Aktyubinsk field in June in a privatization deal involving a former state-owned company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of $ 5 billion , the Chinese agreed to assume $ 71 million of debts , pay $ 320 million in cash upfront and guarantee the pensions and housing of some 5,000 employees . <p> While U.S. oil company representatives arrived at the Kazakh capital after 12 hours of air travel , some Chinese oil officials drove  --  a gesture emphasizing the proximity of China 's western oil industry to Kazakhstan , according to an American who monitored the bidding . <p> California-based Chevron is still the top foreign oil firm in Kazakhstan with its 45 percent share of the consortium developing the gigantic Tengiz oil field , the country 's largest . And major U.S. companies , including Texaco and Mobil , won offshore drilling rights and another concession . <p> But Beijing 's interest in Central Asia 's oil and gas riches has injected a new factor into the rush by international oil and gas companies for what is widely regarded as the largest untapped energy reservoir outside the Middle East . <p> " This is a strategic move on China 's part , " said S. Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It symbolizes that Central Asia is China 's new backyard . "
