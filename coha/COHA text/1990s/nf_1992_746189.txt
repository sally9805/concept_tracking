The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire ( MDQ ) is the most widely used method of assessing premenstrual symptomatology . It is also the most frequently criticized instrument in this field . A review of the criticisms made toward the MDQ revealed three major issues concerning the reliability and validity of this instrument and the sample from whom normative data were gathered . These issues were examined in light of 49 studies that used this instrument between 1968 and 1990 . Many of the criticisms were found to be justified . A marked lack of adequate research into the MDQ 's reliability , problems associated with the normative sample , and uncertain validity were found . In particular , the MDQ appears to measure constructs unrelated to the menstrual cycle and define premenstrual syndrome inaccurately . In addition , the factor structure of this instrument may be unstable . These conclusions were tempered with the knowledge that the MDQ has not been utilized to its full potential in most of the research conducted to date . <p> Medical observers since the time of Hippocrates have ascribed a variety of mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern research in this area is generally traced to Frank 's ( 1931 ) report of the existence of " premenstrual tension " in the 7 to 10 days preceding the onset of menstruation , with offset of symptoms soon after onset of menstruation in women . Greene and Dalton ( 1953 ) have described premenstrual symptoms as being of extraordinary diversity and Dalton ( 1964 ) has suggested that there are few tissues in the body which may not on occasion be affected by menstrual variations and premenstrual exacerbations . <p> While much information has been obtained regarding the etiology and treatment of the premenstrual tension syndrome , also called the premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) , this information is , at best , contradictory and incomplete ( Siegel , Myers , &; Dineen , 1987 ) . As such , it remains a poorly understood phenomenon to date ( Hackett &; Abplanalp , 1982 ) . The major causes of this lack of understanding are those of inaccurate conceptualization of the syndrome and resulting measurement problems . <p> As the syndrome has been conceptualized in different ways , measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables . Indeed , the area of premenstrual research has been plagued by the use of assessment devices that have not been validated . The belief that a large proportion of women experience premenstrual changes has evolved out of research that has used these unvalidated instruments . Moreover , the media 's wide endorsement of these research findings has greatly influenced the public in regard to this belief ( Maddocks , Hahn , Moller , &; Reid , 1986 ) . As women who do suffer from PMS may be particularly vulnerable to the promotion of unproven and potentially costly treatments offered by specialized PMS clinics , more vigorous investigation into currently used assessment devices is therefore urgently needed . <p> There are currently several instruments for assessing PMS ( e.g. , Menstrual Distress Questionnaire ( MDQ ) , Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) , Premenstrual Assessment Form ( PAF ) , and Menstrual Symptoms Questionnaire ( MSQ ) ) . All of these devices have been criticized to varying extents . A review of the major criticisms reported revealed similar areas of concern , these being the reliability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects from whom normative data were gathered . <p> Interestingly , while these criticisms have been reported , no comprehensive review has been undertaken in order to assess if these criticisms are indeed supported by empirical data . The present study addresses this issue . <p> As the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire ( MDQ ) ( Moos , 1968 ) is the most extensively criticized instrument for assessing premenstrual symptomatology , and as it is the most widely used instrument for assessing such , there is a real need to assess its many criticisms . Further , sufficient data are available from its use on which these criticisms can be evaluated . This paper does not evaluate the less commonly used questionnaires ( e.g. , MSQ , PAF ) as there is insufficient empirical data presently available . This is particularly true of the promising and recently developed Premenstrual Assessment Form ( PAF ) ( Halbreich , Endicott , Schacht , &Nee,; 1982 ) . Additionally , the present evaluation of the MDQ is of great importance when one considers that Moos ' ( 1968 ) definition of PMS has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thus , the aim of the present paper is to determine the usefulness of the MDQ as an instrument for assessing premenstrual symptomatology . To do so , studies that have used the MDQ are examined in light of the criticisms made toward the instrument . As previously stated , three basic criticisms are ( a ) the reliability of the MDQ , ( b ) the validity of the MDQ , and ( c ) the normative sample of the MDQ . These issues are dealt with below . First , however , a brief description of Moos ' questionnaire and its development may be in order . MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRE ( MDQ ) <p> Prior to 1968 and the development of the MDQ ( Moos , 1968 ) , the major problem in premenstrual research was the diversity of assessment techniques used . Each experimenter defined and rated symptoms in an idiosyncratic way that made it difficult to compare results across studies . In recognition of this problem , Moos developed the MDQ in order to standardize the assessment of PMS and thus enable researchers to compare large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inclusion on the MDQ from several sources : ( a ) detailed review of previous research on menstrual cycle symptomatology ; ( b ) open-ended interviews eliciting possible menstrual cycle symptoms ; and ( c ) a selection of control symptoms from the Blatt Menopausal Index ( 1953 ) which 20-30 year old females endorsed with low frequency . After removal of redundant items , 47 symptom items remained ( e.g. , insomnia , headache , anxiety , decrease in efficiency ) . <p> Moos ' ( 1968 ) factor analysis of these 47 items revealed seven highly correlated subscales . These sub-scales were : pain , water retention , negative affect , autonomic reaction , concentration , behavior change , and arousal . Additionally , an eighth or control scale was included in order to assure that the answers given on the seven sub-scales were related to the menstrual cycle experience and not simply a result of general feelings of dysphoria or a general tendency to complain . <p> Subjects are asked to assign a numerical weight according to their experience of each of the 47 items , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 3 ( " symptoms present , mild " ) to 6 ( " acute or partially disabling symptoms " ) . They are asked to do this for each of three phases of their ( a ) most recent and ( b ) worse menstrual cycle . <p> Forms <p> This original version of the MDQ is Form A. Moos further made available a complimentary prospective version of the MDQ , Form T ( 1969 ) , where subjects rate each symptom with respect to how they are feeling at the time they are completing the questionnaire ( T = today ) , and another version , Form C ( 1977 ) , which asks subjects to rate each symptom with respect to the most recent menstrual cycle . <p> Versions <p> In 1979 , Clare and Wiggins designed and published a modified version ( both a prospective and a retrospective measure ) of this most recent MDQ version . They adapted Moos ' Form C by omitting symptoms contributing to the arousal and control scales . Clare and Wiggins claim that the retrospective measure systematically obtains information on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permits the identification of different premenstrual and menstrual symptom profiles . In place of the eight factors of the original MDQ , this instrument covers seven symptom factors ( concentration problems , negative emotions , autonomic symptoms , pain , water retention , behavioral changes , and clumsiness ) , is composed of 34 items rather than 47 items , restricts respondents to a 4-point scale and only requests information related to the 7 days prior to onset of menses . <p> Versions currently in use <p> All versions of the MDQ are currently used . However , most studies continue to use the original version of the MDQ ( Form A ) and its complimentary prospective form ( Form T ) . For example , 48 of the 53 studies examined presently used the original versions of the MDQ , one study used Form C , and eight studies used the modified MDQ . Consequently , the results of this paper are primarily related to the original versions ( i.e. , Forms A and T ) . <p> Searching procedures for studies using the MDQ for the present review <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the MDQ . These included the use of the Psychological Abstracts ( 1968-1974 ) and four computer-based index systems which covered material from 1974 to 1990 : Psychological Literature , Eric , Sociofile , and Medicus . Terms used for searching were premenstrual , menstrual , menstrual distress , premenstrual tension/syndrome , Moos , and Menstrual Distress Questionnaire . <p> These terms identified over 1,000 studies that have been performed in premenstrual research . The abstracts of each of these studies were then examined for the use of a questionnaire in measuring PMS symptoms . Over 100 studies met this criteria . These studies were then examined in detail in order to determine if the questionnaire used was the MDQ . The MDQ was used in 53 of these studies , which are shown in Table 1 , and which are included in the present paper . Table I also includes information regarding the use of MDQ as a diagnostic tool , oral contraceptive , and psychiatric status control , and the sample composition of studies included in this paper . These issues are discussed in the following sections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Validity of the MDQ , and the Normative Sample of the MDQ are evaluated in view of relevant studies performed in the area . RELIABILITY <p> Internal Consistency <p> Internal consistency estimates of reliability are based upon the average intercorrelations among the items on a test . The only data available here is that of Markum 's ( 1976 ) split-half analysis of Form T. She reported that the MDQ ( Form T ) is internally consistent with alpha 's ranging from .82 to .98 . <p> Temporal Stability <p> Moos and colleagues ( 1969 ) tested the stability of factors over time using the data of 15 women selected from Moos ' normative sample on the basis of their high or low responses to the MDQ . Thus , the stability reported by Moos et al . ( 1969 ) may be solely due to the selection of this small specific sample ( Englander-Golden , Whitmore &; Dienstbier , 1978 ) . Further , while Moos et al . ( 1969 ) interpreted the correlations ( calculated between the symptoms reported on two consecutive cycles ) as being generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible eight scales , four are below .40 in the menstrual phase , four are below .50 in the premenstrual phase , and five are below .40 in the intermenstrual phase , including two that are below .15 . While Moos et al . ( 1969 ) purpose was to assess the test-retest reliability of the MDQ , the analysis was performed on only 24 of the 47 items . <p> While Markum ( 1976 ) and Lahmeyer , Miller , and DeLeon-Jones ( 1982 ) report the MDQ ( Form T ) to have good stability over time ( e.g , Markum , .80 to .96 except for the menstrual phase of .26 ) , the number of subjects in some cells of analyses in both studies was small . Similarly , Abplanalp , Donnelly , and Rose 's ( 1979 ) report of a high degree of overlap between scores on two administrations of the MDQ ( Form A ) was based on a small sample of women ( N = 33 ) . To determine if these results are true reflections of the reliability of the MDQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is generally agreed that two or more cycles must be monitored in order to obtain meaningful results . AIthough Wilcoxon , Schrader , and Sherif 's ( 1976 ) research showed no evidence of instrument deterioration ( Form T ) ( i.e. , no systematic increases or decreases in self-report attributable to loss of effort or interest ) , the time period involved was only 5 weeks . Information regarding instrument deterioration over longer periods of use remains unknown . VALIDITY <p> In discussing the validity of the MDQ , the present paper will focus upon hve different types : ( a ) content , ( b ) construct , ( c ) factorial , ( d ) concurrent , and ( e ) discriminate . <p> Content Validity <p> Definition . During the last 10 years , there have been a number of significant developments in the definition of PMS , especially with the advent of the inclusion of PMS in the Appendix section of the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Marital of Mental Disorders ( revised third edition ( DMS-III-R ) , 1987 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although this definition has been available for 3 years , no comparison has been made between the content of the MDQ and that of the Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder ( DSM-III-R , 1987 ) . <p> In contrast to the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-III-R , the MDQ includes items of arousal ( e.g. , bursts of energy ) and autonomic reactions ( e.g. , hot flushes ) , yet does not include items related to hyposomnia . Further , the MDQ does not require that the disturbance severely interferes with working , usual social activities , or relationships with others . Both definitions do , however , agree that the symptoms must be phase-related . <p> Consistency of findings based on Moos definition of PMS . Moos ( 1968 ) claimed the amount and type of reported premenstrual symptomatology varies with certain phases of the menstrual cycle and that these changes are reflected in lower intermenstrual scores on the MDQ . Indeed , the majority of studies ( 9 of 11 ) , 3 which assessed phase differences , reported these effects to be present on some scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; Dienstbier , 1978 ; Golub , 1976 ; Golub &; Harrington , 1981 ; Haskett , Steiner , &; Carroll , 1984 ; Kirstein , Rosenberg , &; Smith , 1981 ; Slade , 1984 ; Van Der Akker &; Steptoe , 1985 ) . However , there exists two alternative , non-menstrually related explanations for these results . First , of those studies which reported phase effects present , all but one ( Abplanalp et al. , 1979 ) failed to control for the absence of psychiatric disorders in their subjects . In contrast , all of the studies which screened for psychiatric disorders reported no phase effects evident . <p> Secondly , the presence of phase effects may be related to the use of a retrospective instrument . For example , of the nine studies that reported significant phase effects , seven studies show inconsistency between retrospective reports on the MDQ and prospective measures ( Abplanalp et al. , 1979 ; Englander-Golden et al. , 1978 ; Golub , 1976 ; Golub &; Harrington , 1981 ; Kirstein et al. , 1981 ; Slade , 1984 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies did find that phase differences on physical symptom items were present when measured by retrospective and prospective measures ( Englander-Golden et al. , 1978 ; Kirstein et al. , 1981 ; Slade , 1984 ) . These findings suggest that the MDQ may accurately measure physical symptoms . <p> Classification and diagnosis based upon Moos ' definition of PMS . Seventeen of the studies examined in this paper used the MDQ for diagnostic purposes ( see Table 1 ) . Of these 17 , 11 utilized an operational definition of PMS similar to Moos ( 1968 ) , whereby a woman is considered to be suffering from PMS if her premenstrual symptom scores are significantly elevated from her intermenstrual scores on 3 to 4 of the symptom scales on the MDQ ( see Table 2 ) . However , as this operational definition does not account for a subject 's general level of complaining , the results may be more indicative of a subject 's complaining style rather than her menstrual cycle symptomatology . Moreover , 6 of these 11 studies employed even more problematic operational definitions of PMS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 ) diagnosed PMS on the basis of scores from only 24 of the 47 items , Van Der Ploeg ( 1985 ) and Hart and Russell ( 1986 ) used differences on only 10 and 8 items ( respectively ) for diagnosis of PMS and Clare ( 1979,1983 ) and Clare and Wiggins ( 1979 ) diagnosed PMS on the basis of one symptom on the MDQ being rated as moderate or severe , failing to even examine difference scores . ) <p> Four other studies ( see Table 2 ) used a method of correcting for subjects ' complaining style by subtracting intermenstrual phase scores ( baseline ) from other phase scores . However , as Busch , Cosata , Whitehead , and Heller ( 1988 ) point out , this method is also problematic in that it is based upon total scores when identical such scores on the MDQ do not represent the same degree of severity in symptoms . For instance , as the severity ratings are summed , it is possible that two respondents may have the same score with one rating many symptoms as mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Two studies overcame the problems associated with using total score differences for diagnosing PMS ( Table 2 ) . They employed instead Sampson and Jenner 's ( 1977 ) method of fitting a least mean squares cosine wave to factor scores of each individual , to obtain a degree of increase in complaining from each subject 's mean level of complaining . Hence , PMS is diagnosed only when there are significant peaks in complaining in the premenstrual phase of an individual subject . This method also argues against criticisms that the MDQ does not measure change in symptoms over phases ( Halbreich &; Endicott , 1984 ; Mohan &; Chopra , 1987 ) . <p> Sampson and Jenner published this method in 1977 . Yet , as Table 3 demonstrates , only 2 of the 17 studies that have been conducted since utilized this most adequate operational definition of PMS . Thus , criticisms aimed at the content validity of the MDQ , in regard to it leading to correct diagnosis of PMS , must be tempered with the knowledge that the instrument has not been utilized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major issue regarding the construct validity of the MDQ is whether it measures PMS symptomatology or something entirely different . Moos ( 1968 ) states that a woman 's responses on the MDQ represents her direct personal experience of menstrual changes . However , Parlee ( 1974 ) found that males and females gave similar reports on the MDQ ( Form A ) in regard to the kinds of symptom changes during the menstrual cycle . Similarly , Brooks , Ruble , and Clarke ( 1979 ) found that when subjects were asked to report symptoms " as if " they were in the premenstrual phase , more symptoms were reported , while Brooks-Gunn and Ruble ( 1979 ) found that expected symptoms of females not yet menstruating were similar to symptoms reported by menstruating females on the MDQ . In addition , Stevens and Gardner ( 1981 ) found an attitude of menstruation as a illness when relating menstruation to the self , and a shift in attitude to more psychological symptoms when subjects were asked to relate menstruation to a friend . These results suggest that responses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . Indeed , that retrospectively reported symptoms have not been confirmed on prospective measures ( e.g. , Englander-Golden et al. , 1978 ; Golub , 1976a , 1976b ; Golub &; Harrington , 1981 ) further suggests that retrospective responses may be the result of stereotypes or a socially desirable response set ( Gannon , 1981 ) . <p> Several researchers have suggested that stereotypic responses are given due to the menstrually related purpose of a study being known to the subjects . Three studies have examined this possibility by employing a hidden purpose design ( Markum , 1976 ; Rogers &; Harding , 1981 ; Van Der Akker &; Steptoe , 1985 ) ; each reported that concealing the purpose of the study did not affect the symptoms reported and that these symptoms are not likely to have been produced by cultural stereotypes . However , an attributional processing biases explanation can not be ruled out . For instance , Ruble ( 1977 ) has shown that women who were led to believe they were in the premenstrual phase prospectively reported more symptoms than women led to believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actual cycle phase . It may therefore be , as Rubinow and Roy-Byrne ( 1984 ) indicate , that woman attribute negative symptoms to the premenstrual and menstrual phases even though such experiences may be randomly distributed throughout the cycle . <p> Pazy , Yedlin , and Lomranz , ( 1989 ) suggest that the MDQ may be measuring something different to stereotypes and yet still not be measuring variables related to the menstrual cycle . They proposed that the MDQ 's method produces a priming effect , whereby the intermenstrual period is used as a comparison base from which subjects rate menstrually-related symptoms . Their results are indicative of the existence of such a priming effect ; intermenstrual scores were close to those reported in the premenstrual phase when priming was removed . These studies suggest that the responses on the MDQ are the result of the measurement of variables other than those related to the menstrual cycle . <p> In summary , it can not be concluded that the MDQ is measuring premenstrual symptomatology . There is a great deal of evidence suggesting that the retrospective and prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al . ' s ( 1989 ) results further suggest that the MDQ measures variables not related to the menstrual cycle . <p> Factorial Validity <p> Four studies have investigated the factor structure of the original version of the MDQ , while one study has investigated the factor structure of Form T , and one other study has examined Clare and Wiggin 's ( 1979 ) modified version of the MDQ ( Prospective ) . <p> Form A. The results of Woods , Dery , and Most ( 1982 ) are not examined here as only 16 items were entered into their factor analysis . The results of the remaining hve studies are conflicting . For instance , Moos ' eight-factor structure was found by Brooks-Gunn &; Ruble ( 1979 ) and Silbergeld , Brast , and Noble ( 1971 ) ( though with some symptoms loading on different symptom clusters in the latter study ) . In contrast , these eight factors were not evident in Cullberg 's ( 1972 ) study . Ruling out sample differences , Cullberg suggested that the factor analysis was blurred due to several items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects interpreting the questions differently . This may be tied to Cullberg 's use of a Swedish version of the MDQ . Hence , the different versions used may explain the different results obtained . <p> Another possible explanation is that of cultural stereotypes . For example , Englander-Golden et al . ( 1978 ) point out that as the eight factors were established on the retrospective responses of 839 females , the factors may be the result of cultural stereotypes that exaggerated cycle variations . In the absence of any comparative study in regard to Swedish and American menstrual cycle stereotypes , Cullberg 's results can not be used to determine the validity of the MDQ 's factor structure . <p> Form T. Form T is an identical measure to Form A , except that subjects report on symptoms prospectively . Siegal , Myers , and Dineen 's ( 1987 ) factor analysis of this form failed to replicate Moos ' eight factors . Instead , five clusters were found : Withdrawn mood , anxious/tense mood , explaining together 79% of the variance of the overall score , physical discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arousal ( &lt;4% ) . <p> One reason for the failure to find the original eight factors could be due to the use of different samples . That is , Siegal et al . ' s ( 1987 ) sample comprised subjects who complained of severe PMS and were obtained from PMS clinic sources . <p> MMDQ ( prospective ) . One study has investigated the factor structure of the modiBed MDQ . Unfortunately , no distinct symptom clusters were identified ( Van Der Akker &; Steptoe , 1985 ) . Again , differences in samples may account for this result , in that Van Der Akker and Steptoe 's sample were hospital staff and nurses , whereas Clare and Wiggin 's sample comprised women who attended general health clinics . <p> In summary , out of the five studies that have examined the factor structure of the MDQ ( Forms A , T , and MMDQ ) , the original factors were only replicated in two . While differences in samples may explain the failure of the other three studies to identify these factors , these findings do question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research employing comparative samples is needed to determine if the scales of the MDQ do constitute PMS . <p> The conflicting results have great relevance to the etiology of PMS and therapeutic interventions aimed at PMS . That is , it is possible that each of the five symptom clusters found by Siegal et al . ( 1987 ) has a unique etiology and that women whose symptoms fall under different categories respond differently to different interventions . Consequently , conclusions that have been drawn regarding the effectiveness of interventions that were based upon Moos ' original factor structure may need to be rethought . For instance , a particular intervention that was unsuccessful in treating symptoms clustered in Moos ' structure may prove to be beneficial in treating symptoms clustered in Siegal et al . ' s ( 1987 ) structure . Supporting this interpretation is Moos and Liederman 's ( 1978 ) cluster analysis of the MDQ Form A. They found two clusters , one in which subjects complained of only one symptom area/scale , and another where subjects complained of more than one symptom area/scale . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etiologies and , as such , may respond differently to the same treatment . <p> Concurrent Validity <p> There is a marked lack of information pertaining to correlations between the MDQ and other concurrent measures of PMS . Some studies have , however , assessed the concurrent validity of certain scales of the MDQ . For instance , Golub ( 1976a , 1976b ) and Golub and Harrington ( 1981 ) used both the Depression Adjective Checklist ( Lubin , 1967 ) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( Speilberg , Goruch &; Lushene , 1970 ) and a set of cognitive tests in order to compare these measures to the respective negative affect and concentration factors of the MDQ . They reported no significant correlations between the MDQ negative affect scores and the other negative affect measures . Similarly , no significant correlation was found between the MDQ 's concentration scale and concurrent performance on cognitive tests . <p> Further , Abplanalp et al . ( 1979 ) found no changes on measures of mood ( Profile of Mood States ) and social interaction ( Social-Sexual Activities Log ) over two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales . These data are indicative of various scales of the MDQ lacking concurrent validity . <p> Discriminant Validity <p> Morse and colleagues ( 1987 ) report that the MDQ could not discriminate between a group of confirmed PMS women and a community sample of women who did not complain of PMS symptoms . However , as some women in their group of noncomplainers did in fact report complaints/symptoms , the lack of discrimination between the groups may have been a result of sampling errors , rather than lack of discriminant validity on the MDQ . Surprisingly , no other information regarding the MDQ 's discriminant validity was stated in any of the other 52 studies . NORMATIVE SAMPLE <p> Characteristics of normative sample <p> A crucial requirement in the use of any instrument is that of the comparability between the subjects who are tested and the standardization sample that yielded the norms . Unfortunately , Moos ' standardization sample is subject to sampling problems . For example , women with severe PMS are typically older than those in Moos ' sample , which is made up almost entirely of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myers , &; Dineen , 1987 ) . In addition , 50% of the sample were taking oral contraceptives , nearly 10% were pregnant , and over half of the subjects had not yet had children ( Parlee , 1974 ) . Of importance , this information-vital to the interpretation of results-was not reported in the MDQ manual ( Parlee , 1974 ) . Indeed , the use of oral contraceptives and age have been shown to influence symptom experiences ( Dalton , 1982 ; Moos et al. , 1969 ) and thus comparisons to the MDQ 's norms must be considered cautiously . <p> Comparability of studies using the MDQ <p> Based on the findings that many of the MDQ items were reflective of mental status abnormalities ( e.g. , 30 of the 47 symptoms on the MDQ are often found in association with psychosis ) , Zola and colleagues ( 1979 ) suggest that the MDQ is an inappropriate means of measuring PMS in psychiatric populations . They further suggest that studies which do not screen for psychiatric disorders in subjects should consider this conclusion when planning the PMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing the MDQ was to enable researchers to compare large groups of women . However , inspection of the different types of subject sources used by the 53 studies which have utilized the MDQ suggests that such comparisons should not be made . For instance , of the 53 studies examined in this paper , 24 studies were conducted on volunteer samples , 18 studies were conducted with student samples , 4 studies were conducted on mixed samples ( i.e. , students and volunteers ) , 5 studies were conducted on clinic samples , 1 study was conducted on a sample of subjects who answered a newspaper advertisement for sufferers of severe PMS , and one other study was conducted on a psychiatric patient sample ( see Table 1 ) . <p> Those studies which used volunteer , student , and clinic samples can not be compared as these are not representative samples ( Halbreich &; Endicott , 1985 ) . Further complicating the matter of comparability of studies using the MDQ , is that 26 studies controlled for the psychiatric status of subjects ( 8 of which also controlled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studies failed to control for either of these potentially confounding variables . Thus , it appears that Moos objective of providing an instrument which would enable comparisons of large numbers of women has been unsuccessful . However , this is not a fault of the instrument as such , but rather the failure of different studies to control for different subject sources . If studies are performed on subjects from similar sources , with similar oral contraceptive and psychiatric status controls , the MDQ may be a way of comparing large numbers of women . <p> Generalizability of studies using the MDQ <p> A related problem to comparability is generalizability . While the results of those studies which assessed specific populations ( e.g. , psychiatric patients ) are not generalizable to the general population , this conclusion may also apply to studies which sampled more normal populations because of high attrition rates ( refer to Table 3 ) . That is , Dennerstein and Burrows ( 1979 ) suggest high attrition rates result in data that is solely representative of highly cooperative and motivated females . Thus , the outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to similarly co-operative and motivated females . CONCLUSION <p> The criticisms that have been made toward the MDQ as a PMS assessment device were summarized into three basic questions concerning the reliability of the instrument , the validity of the instrument , and the normative sample from whom data were gathered . In regard to the validity of the MDQ , it appears that many of the criticisms are justified . That is , a major problem for the MDQ is a lack of data which unquestionably shows it to measure what it purports to measure . Further , the factors that Moos originally thought constituted PMS , and which guided PMS research for over a decade , have not been consistently verified in other studies . Thus , interpretations of the effectiveness of interventions based upon the existence of these clusters and their distinct nature must be conservatively regarded . The MDQ 's concurrent and discriminant validity are relatively uninvestigated areas . The little research that has been conducted does not reflect favorably on the MDQ . <p> However , not all the criticisms are valid . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , many authors failed to use this method . As such , criticisms aimed at the ability of the MDQ to accurately diagnose PMS should be moderated by the fact that the MDQ has not been used to its potential . Similarly , in regard to the reliability of the MDQ , there exists a marked lack of adequately designed research into the MDQ 's stability over time and the internal consistency of items for all versions of the MDQ . This is surprising given that reliability is a basic issue in any research endeavour . Thus , criticisms aimed at the MDQ 's reliability must also consider that only four studies have examined this important area . <p> Further , due to sampling problems in the normative sample , the reliability of the MDQ 's norms is not established . Also , the limited generalizability and comparability of studies which have used the MDQ points to the need for researchers to examine subject sources and the related comparability of various sources in the initial study design . <p> One final note must he made . It appears that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies that used retrospective measures on the MDQ are of no value . However , these studies do give valuable information , in regard to what other variables are related to the reporting of symptoms on the retrospective device ( e.g. , attitudes to menstruation or to the female role ) . <p> While some of the criticisms aimed at the MDQ as a PMS assessment device can more properly be directed to the general poor use of this instrument in past research , the present findings do indicate that the original versions of the MDQ have a problematic normative sample , and all versions of this instrument have uncertain reliability and questionable validity . As any assessment procedure must be both valid and reliable for it to yield information that is useful in classification , and therefore for diagnosis and treatment , the present findings do not lend themselves to recommending the set of MDQ questionnaires , and the original versions in particular , as adequate research tools for assessing premenstrual symptomatology . <p>                 @ @ @ @
