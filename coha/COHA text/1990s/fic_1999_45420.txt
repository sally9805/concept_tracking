1 <p> The telephone interrupted Alex while he was digitizing a reproduction of Goya 's Third of May . " Viktor 's disappeared again . " His mother 's voice , slow and faintly masculine . A branch pecked the pane and a black squirrel landed on the ledge . Their eyes met . " How long has he been gone ? " " Three days . " " You 're a regular missing person 's bureau , Adriana . " " Your picture 's on the wall , too , darling . How will I know you when I see you ? " <p> " I 'll be the one wearing the stigmata . " He stared at the screen where the gray Spanish cathedral town slowly assembled itself . Abraham whistled . Alex looked up at the cage dangling from the white ceiling fan in the middle of the studio . The parakeet , bright as the produce aisle , blinked back . Alex stood up and stretched . <p> Adriana retained a weakness for her unpredictable brother . She felt protective . Viktor the Spinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AWOL . The last time , he returned after three days sporting a bruised cheek . He refused to say where he 'd been . Viktor 's love for vodka verged on patriotism and rumors reached Adriana that her brother had been seen in unlikely neighborhoods in the company of young men . <p> After Alex 's collapse , when she realized her son wanted little to do with her , she found even Viktor a comfort . Though she was past seventy , she kept busy . She smoked , she rode her exercise bicycle , she read . Occasionally she visited the last restaurant where she worked in Elmora and once during lunch she even put on her old apron and helped her friend Deidre behind the counter because another girl had gone home sick . <p> Mrs. Florentina , who 'd moved to her own home a few blocks away , still visited , and the women shopped together at the malls on Route I. Adriana began cooking , trying new recipes . She fried tofu , Mexican food , brown rice . She got a library card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with images of tropical places where she might have lived . What would her life have been like in New Guinea ? She often kept the books for months , then strained her social security paying the fines . She did n't mind . The books helped her feel freer . She was as powerless now as she had been during the war . Age was another battle . <p> Her ghosts returned periodically : no longer lyrical presences , they 'd become sullen shades whose frowning faces shadowed her everywhere ; even tiny Nina hovered in the air reproachfully , finally faded from green to pale yellow . <p> Only Jesus remained an exuberant witness to her life : she reconnected with her church and it provided community . She loved chatting with the ladies who 'd shunned her once . She was at last one of them . The way time hardened her left her yearning for a place of repose . And suppose something had happened to Viktor ? An old-world feud , a sexual vendetta . More likely , it was a spree that would end with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life was war , and the odd bout of rowdiness raised few eyebrows among the emigres . Alex ignored the politics that absorbed his mother half a century after Ellis Island . " Imagine you 're going to China , " he explained to a succession of visiting girlfriends when he brought them to Jersey : " Remember , you 're crossing a border . " <p> He 'd just finished a project that had absorbed him over the last year : Enemies of the Future , a series of dream-photographs of his father . He had reached the end with one subject and one medium and he was ready to move to the next thing . Machines had played a part in his working life from xerox days-time to check out computer art . <p> He studied the Goya on the screen : a man in a white shirt and mustard pants stood before a firing squad , arms raised in despair , fear , invitation . With a few keystrokes or mouse clicks , Alex could morph him to Donald Duck . What was the stuff below his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to materialize on paper . <p> He went to the kitchen area , picked up a stale muffin , opened the window , and squeezing it , dribbled crumbs onto the ledge . A kid on roller blades dodged the cars crawling the narrow North End street . Last week someone had slashed the tires of his Orange VW-it was the third or fourth such sign of welcome from the closely knit neighborhood . He was unintimidated-the violence of his past immunized him . The February air , as he held his hand out the window , felt slippery and sexual and he heard a familiar aria off that new CD by the Three Tenors drifting up from a neighbor 's room . <p> He surveyed the sparsely furnished studio to see what needed doing . Besides the trestle table of paints , and the canvases everywhere-stacked , hung , and folded-there was a futon on the floor , a brown bean bag chair , a round butcher block table in the kitchen area , a metal computer desk , a thirteen-inch black and white Tv , and two custom-made floor-to-ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to weed out her thingsthe sweaters and underwear in the drawers , the Spanish books stacked on the floor , the pricey enamelware and china ? Alex walked up to Abraham , who 'd grown morose , and offered his finger-the bird was a love child , born the evening he and Luz-Marie spent at the Galleria Mall . He 'd have to ask his neighbor , Mrs. Dorfman , to feed it for a few days . And do n't forget the Xanax . <p> He lifted the black and white image from the printer . This time , he stared at the dead man lying at the feet of the next victim . Apparently Goya watched the execution from his window . Napoleon 's soldiers had rounded up men they accused of supporting the deposed king , and shot them on the spot . <p> He tucked the paper inside his black sketch pad . Then he picked up the phone and called the plant to say there was an emergency , and he would need a few more days off . He sank down into the bean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex did not look forward to going to New Jersey . He had a bad feeling about it . <p> He picked a book on Goya off the floor-that had been LM 's only lasting legacy . Then he remembered the bull . In Spain , Luz-Marie took him to a bullfight where they watched four bulls slaughtered in two hours . Shorter than the average movie . The animals ' energy surged like a current through the arena , animating even the drunks behind them . Alex felt his fiancee 's thrill ; if she could she would have licked the dead bull before it was hauled off by its feet , blood mapping the dust . The Cathedral of Burgos with its barnacled spires piercing the sky , and the fiestas of Seville had bored her . He should have known then the different tones to which they tuned their souls . Yet he convinced himself he loved everything about Luz , from the way she brushed her teeth to how her jaw jutted , as though daring the world to take a swipe at it , to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had such charms and gifts : she tap-danced , did magic tricks , and could speak backwards . She could repeat backwards whatever you said to her . In bed after sex , he would make some intimate confession and hear it parroted : Toh er'uoy dog . And she made up words . Zapatenku became their code . Movies they did n't like were zapatenku , people about whom they had reservations were zapatenku . In Spain they drove everywhere , from Barcelona to Granada , taking the road up La Veleta , la mas alta via in todo Europa , where the subtlest ether flowed between them as they stood outside the car at the top looking at the unreal , shimmering landscape . They visited Salamanca , home of philosopher Unamuno , rector of the university during the war : when the fascists showed up at the gates of the school , the philosopher , elegant in a beret , stood outside the entryway , facing down hundreds of soldiers with guns : <p> " This is the temple of the intellect and I am its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to them . They entered , arresting him-and where were they now ? We live for eternity , Alex thought , in the memory of the generations who follow us because of what we 've done and said during our brief stay on this mysterious field . Soon after they returned , LM became busy at work , taking double shifts at the hospital , telling him not to wait up , spending more time at her place , where he finally drove one night when he was sick of sleeping alone . He found her in the car outside making out with her boss . He honked his horn and they looked in the mirror . The man drove off , she got in his car , and he could still remember feeling his future dissolve in a slow fade to black . She was n't sorry , she was doing what she wanted . He thought he was past such aching . He remembered the first time he 'd been betrayed , at eighteen , by a girl who worked in the local sweet shop . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to choose how to respond , whether to act on the hatred and rage in his heart , or to transmute it-the world could be divided into those who 'd been betrayed in their lives and those who had n't , who lived in an entirely different moral universe , an early Eden . Later he himself initiated others into the ways of the world . For weeks he called LM late at night at her lover 's place and listened to her curse him , felt his heart gouged by burning beaks . He woke hours before dawn wanting a drink . Sometimes he 'd call me or Tom , but not often . We urged him to lean on us , but he was determined to go solo . After several months they began speaking again . <p> Adriana did n't know yet about the break-up and asked him sometimes about Luz-Marie. 2 <p> Sunday morning . A dog barked several houses away . A siren , children 's laughter , a trill of city notes . Sitting in a plastic lawn chair on the back porch above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adriana appeared to nod in the wind . Back from eight o'clock mass , she looked ahead to the prospect of the day . Clouds were moving in but at the moment the sun depressed her spirits . She read about storms , avalanches and quakes around the world , while here she sat amid blessings . Did she deserve it ? <p> Father Myron frightened her with his fugue about the Sermon on the Mount . She 'd watched him slip out of his round little body and rise to a place in his head where he mingled with the words , looking down on them all far below . After concluding , he 'd cleared his throat , brought the water glass to his lips , and the congregation had sat in silence . " Woe unto you that are full . For ye shall hunger . " She felt terribly full at that moment and as she looked around at Mrs. Hlib and Mrs. Dumka and Mrs. Plishko , it seemed that everyone was equally full . They 'd been hungry once a long time ago and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still hungry even though they certainly were n't . She 'd squeezed the folds of flesh over her hips and felt her thighs rubbing together . She was aware of her breasts and how her self had settled like a seed in a bed of lard , drawing her mind away from the higher things . Her corns , her veins , her knees-they gripped her and kept her from reaching higher . Pity humans had broken down to the point where they had one doctor for the body and one for the soul . She had been hungry , and now she was full , which meant that she would be hungry again . Her heart beat quickly and she looked around at the faces of her friends who seemed serene except of course for Mrs. Hlib who , ever since her husband 's death , kept her eyes open extra wide in case he made an appearance . She knew that the fullness and emptiness might refer to matters of the spirit but she thought of those faces of the starving children she 'd seen on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wait . The men were doing it in Africa now-all her suffering had been at the hands of men . <p> Walking home , she could n't focus on the ground beneath her feet because there was another thing Jesus said that kept coming back to her . A tree is known by its fruits , and what did that tell her about herself ? When she was pregnant with Alex she saw herself as Mary , of course . All Catholic mothers did . But that was n't how it turned out . Life had reduced her , left her crabbed-her shell , anyway ; she 'd spent too much energy on the dead . She sometimes felt wildly free , yet when she tried to show her satisfaction , a sedimentary sarcasm deposited by the years interfered . <p> Watching a woman two houses down attacking the garden with an unseasonable shovel , she sought words for the inner structure of the plot that had been her life . Had she achieved any of her desires ? No , the answer was obvious . It was unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young girl cultivated by kindly parents who began the job of arranging her life and then be swept into the vortex of a few madmen whose violent cores no nuclear weapons could match-she had reached for the natural solution : a child . Two . <p> Her parents had offered the illusion of normalcy : the harvest was tied to the sowing , the Bible was the heart of wisdom , and so on . And she 'd accepted it despite the soldiers . But she failed to pass these truths on . Now the patch of grass before her that had stayed green throughout winter suggested an indolent sweetness , saying softly that here was the promised peace , but it had taken her too long to reach it . How could she have known ? It was her first time ; it was everyone 's first time . A large bird , possibly a hawk , spiraled above her . <p> Each day to work , to school , to church : routine and ritual were the handmaidens of reason . Under siege . The voices infiltrating homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying , leaving her alone with this hallucination , this television , without the resonance and grace of summer or the wisdom and the horror of night . She found herself dreaming less when she slept and more when she woke : her mind tuned out the sensual realities crowding around her and dropped instead into the past . But not even the dead were good company anymore . As she drew nearer to them herself , she grew more skeptical . She was less sure death would live up to her expectations . <p> That her son would n't give her grandchildren bewildered her . Was there another solution to life ? The problem was that her spirit was as strong as ever , even if her body was tired . Denied youth , forced into a second childhood , and now even this stolen from her by her own flesh and blood . Which she had designed . To a certain degree . Because the gardener planted the tulip after preparing the soil but he did n't control the weather , and the frosts and hail of the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw himself as separate , a being discrete and apart . Cult of the individual . But the autonomous soul inhabited an interdependent body . And a child was the dream of the future made flesh . Where was meaning without the future ? <p> She remembered ice-skating around Christmas while visiting her aunt with the family . Every night grandparents and parents took their children to the pond . Half the village , old and young , friends and enemies in brown scarves , mufflers , hats with earflaps , found their way to the ice , gliding past each other , a soft murmur of voices , laughter , a child 's cry when it fell , and the distinct click and scrape of the skates on the ice below , while indolent carp dreamed of the worlds above . <p> Later , on the Rahway , Lev and she held eight-year-old Alex between them while Paul moved on alone . The younger child was clumsy , pudgy , afraid . He wriggled , his knees wobbled , but they held him as they pushed forward across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tingled , yet soon they were sweating . <p> Alex had grudges against her . He thought she did n't know , but she knew the litany of her sins by heart : he wanted her to take a broader view of the world . Here his imagination showed its limits . He 'd never grasp the web tying him to Viktor and a world whose loss he experienced without understanding it-like a man leaning forward to put his elbows on the bar only to find nothing there , falling forward before catching himself . Maybe . <p> She was n't worried about her brother . She had trained herself not to be curious about his secret life . She was sure that he was somewhere nearby-she could feel him-but she was glad to use him as bait to lure Alex home . She sighed . Instead she listened to Anton the poet reciting his incomprehensible verses in her head . This was what was there : for this , then , she would be grateful . <p> Only , sometimes rage seized her . Murderous . The betrayers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The list of condemned men was long . She shook her head as though to dislodge the images that had arisen . <p> She rose slowly . Walking up the stairs of the back porch , she realized that soon , any day , she would need a cane . 3 <p> It was snowing when he woke , the first storm of the season though it was late February . Surprised , not yet sick of it , people smiled as flakes shimmied down from a deep sky . Alex listened to the soft cough and lash of trucks with chains moving slowly down the powdered street . <p> The weather was what he loved best about New England . Standing on the platform at South Station , waiting for the 9:30 train , he watched the snow thicken . Piling up under the posts , it looked like paste . He did n't hurry to board , leaping on at the last possible minute in response to a gesture by one of the blue-coated conductors who reminded him of Union soldiers . <p> Tall and fleshy , Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could gulp eyefuls of ocean . His reflection in the mirror , if he 'd cared to look , would have shown a man at the coda of youth : his dark hair was still long , but it had thinned , and streaks of early gray singed the temples . <p> The car was crowded . An Asian couple sat two rows in front of him , discussing a casino in Atlantic City . Diagonally across , a woman who boarded in Providence chatted on a cell phone all the way to Stamford . He began reading an article about how the government controlled the media but before he could finish it , he fell asleep , waking outside Mystic to watch a swan rise out of the marsh . The bird rowed its wings through the snowy sky . He lurched to the club car where he bought peanuts and a coke . Outside Bridgeport , someone had built a castle of stone , scrap , and boxes . There was a turret of barrels , head lamps peered from the crenallations , and antennae sporting flags flapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train pass . He took out his pad and sketched the scene . Heaps of junked cars curbed the tracks-urban eczema . Cost of doing business . Forget it . There had been judgments enough , Alex thought . <p> He dozed again , waking abruptly to the sound of his own snoring . The woman with the cell phone had been replaced by a black man who slept clutching a paperback under his chin . And there was someone beside him-a dark-haired young woman , in her mid-twenties . She wore a black silk shirt and black pants . There was something clean and crisp about her face , a feeling of precision-she looked well-made , from the hair cut straight across her forehead to the strong chin-some chins simply fell off a face without finishing it , but this one ended cleanly , like a paragraph . <p> She was writing on a yellow pad using a blue pencil . He opened his notebook to the Goya . This time he looked at the seven faceless executioners aiming long rifle barrels at the condemned man . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote something , tore off the paper , and slipped it to him . Was she a mute he wondered , accepting the sheet . He glanced at her , but she kept her eyes averted . He read the page . <p> I love Goya . I was just thinking I wanted his Saturn Devouring His Son for my cover . <p> Her handwriting was clear as a school teacher 's . He took his charcoal pencil and wrote down a question , then passed it back to her . The sound of the train had settled into a mellifluous regularity . I 'm Shelley . <p> Her face reminded him of Jesse at the copy center years ago . She was going to New Jersey to help her parents pack for their move to Florida . <p> Are you an art teacher , she asked a clean sheet . I 'm a painter , he wrote , getting into it . He improvised a little essay : I paint what 's missing . I do still lives , only I paint what 's not there . I put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs beside it . Rest of the tree , for instance , or the worker from Guatemala who picked it . I 've done a series called The Russian Revolution based on objects in my mother 's house . <p> His scrawl colonized the page . He did n't know why he lied . What kind of name is Kruk ? she wrote . When she read his response , she seemed to withdraw a bit and he felt history settling on his shoulder like a familiar bird : Alex the Crow . <p> Her next question was about his family . It felt strange and enchanted , writing things to this pretty woman with a slight cough . A children 's game . The words flowed . He wrote her about his family , embellishing , omitting , and finally turning the tables . She wrote that a couple of years ago she had been living in Italy where she almost married a museum guard at the Uffizi who turned out to be the son of a Sicilian don . <p> " There 's a good story . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , speaking for the first time . " That what you wewe doing ? She nodded . " A writer ? . " Trying . I teach ESL in Boston . " <p> They had just entered the tunnel under Manhattan when the lights went out and the train slowed to a stop . Someone struggled with the door behind them , then a conductor , a black man with gray sixtiesstyle sideburns , came in and announced that there had been a power failure . It would take half an hour at least to repair , sorry for the inconvenience we might lose some heat . <p> A volley of shits echoed around the train . " It 's the second time this month , " she said . Her voice was higher than he 'd expected . <p> She brushed back her hair . Her face , in shadows , seemed to grow sharper , more concentrated . Alex felt the strangeness of the moment . " I can see your breath . " <p> " You do n't seem glad to be going home . " Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about his mother-her work , her life as an emigre , stories about the old world he did n't know he remembered . <p> " Sounds like a horrible life , " Shelley said when he was done . " People do n't just get over things . " <p> He studied the long , straight nose and dark , humid eyes . She was trying to decide how open to be : intelligence moved over her face . " My mother 's cousins died in Auschwitz . " The silence should have lasted longer . " And your father ? " he asked . <p> " He 's Italian . An American , I mean . They 're both from Brooklyn . " " Tenas . Have you ever been to Poland ? " " Do n't think I want to go . " Then she added : <p> " For years I wished my mother would assimilate , but then I started thinking : look at the Jews of Germany . Her family had been there since they were expelled from Spain . They 'd become German . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . " <p> " So are you orthodox ? " he asked . " You do n't know much , do you ? Most goyim know nothing about Jews . It 's not any body 's fault , especially . People go down their little trails and nobody looks in places that are n't already on their map . We all live in ghettos . How many black people do you really know ? " <p> " Do n't know . So what have you heard about my people ? " " Pogroms . Nazis . The usual . And you ? " " Usurers . Communists . The media . " Then he added : " And of course Einstein , Freud , Pollock . " " So where do we start ? " <p> " With the hardest thing . Always say the hardest thing . " " OK . How come you hear about the Holocaust all the time , but never the Famine ? " " Go out and tell the world about it . " <p> " The community thinks information 's suppressed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we do n't have money or power or even an independent country . We 're an easy target . " He found this hard to talk about-indeed , he spoke about it with no one , except for myself . " For years people did n't believe the country I came from existed . All the newspapers called it Russia . It 's like if you were from Boston and moved to Europe and people called you Canadian because people in Canada also speak English . " " You start down this road and who knows where it ends ? " " Fine , let 's stop . We 're Americans . " " You 're right . This is interesting . I 've heard your people were the worst . Camp guards . " <p> He was tense . He too had heard this before . " There were some , sure . And every American owned slaves . " " The point is many Jews feel most Slavs are antisemitic . " " What about the Jews in the party ? There were more of them there than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your mother taught you ? Interesting . " <p> " Here 's the history I heard : the Jews came to Eastern Europe when Western Europe would n't have them . The Russians , who controlled my parents ' country , created the Pale where the Jews could live . They limited the jobs they could have , put them at odds with the native population , pitting people against each other so they do n't see who was using them . Anyway , what 's Russia ? Who were the czars ? There was very little Russian about the Romanovs , who 'd intermarried so much they were more German and Danish than Russian . The Gottorp-Holstein dynasty . " <p> " You think of Jews as coming from elsewhere , not native . You see them as a them in relation to your people . That 's what I mean . That 's antisemitic . " <p> " What should I say to that ? Jews are antislav ? Do you feel that ? I mean , I feel like an American first of all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even now can you admit your complicity ? Just once ? " <p> " Sure , out of forty million people , thousands worked with the Nazis and some were guards in the camps . Some were monsters , those are the odds . Some did it because if they did n't they would have been shot . I do n't know . What would you do if your life was on the line ? " " That is the question . " <p> A long silence followed , during which they both stared at their reflections in the window . Rat on the tracks . " So are you reformed ? " <p> " Do n't change the subject , " her voice was sharp with experienced anger . They stared at each other . " Why is it so hard for you to say these things ? " " Because I 'd like to think I 'm better than I am , " he said . The lights went on , followed by the heat . Still the train did n't move . " I used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she had no idea where his eyes were . This was something he wondered about : could women tell when you were staring at their breasts ?

" " Do I remind you of her ? " Then she changed the subject : Why do you paint ? " " For the power . " " More . " " The power to create the values by which I 'll be measured . " " Yep . " " See . That 's it . " <p> " You know , " she said , backtracking , " I think everything changed after the Holocaust . For everyone . Forget the Famine right now . This is how I see it .

" " But listen , I have to ask you . Do you feel you 're different because of what your family went through ? " " Kidding ? " <p> " Stuff that bothers other people does n't bother me . I could have lived in the Y for years . Friends said I was crazy . I kept thinking : it 's not Siberia , not Germany . There 's nobody about to arrest you , no foot-long spiders in the corners , no man-eating trees in the hall . How bad is it ? " <p> The train began moving . " I know what you mean . For years I 've been trying to figure out this competition angle . My parents pushed me . But their stories told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes most of what people worry about seem crazy . " <p> As the train drew to a stop inside the station , he leaned toward her . " Can I have your number ? " " No . " <p> The snow had stopped , but there were plows on the roads and the traffic out of the city had been bumper to bumper . Standing on the rush hour bus with his fist gripping the rail , he fixed his gaze on a high-cheeked brunette in a brown business suit a few rows up who felt his stare and scouted around for the source of the irritation . He kept thinking about Shelley . He did n't believe in chance . It was a twilight of orange and violet clouds when he debussed at Dairy Queen , a few blocks from the green triple decker in which his mother lived . 4 She was sitting in near darkness when he entered the living room . Everything was neat and in its place-magazines and books rose like powdered sepulchers and stones on the coffee and end tables . Embroidered curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a museum after closing hour . It was cold , of course-as though the new furnace were no better than the iron octopus she 'd replaced a few years back . The apartment had windows loose in their casements and high ceilings . <p> Adriana 's long , even-featured face seemed stretched by the earrings dangling down almost to her shoulders . " You 've gained weight , " she said in greeting . " Should I turn on the light ? " <p> " Why ? I know what you look like . I know what 's in this room . Why waste electricity ? I 'm not afraid of the dark . I like it . " " Has he called ? How long has Viktor been away ? " " I do n't think he knows how to use a phone . I do n't remember his ever using one . Do you ? " After a silence , Adriana said : " Alex , will you excuse me ? I need to be alone . " So he was dismissed . But he knew he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she loved having an audience . Now he was home , she 'd use him like a tape recorder . <p> His own earliest drawings covered the walls : an old man walking a horse by the river , portraits of Viktor and Paul . When had Ada put them up ? <p> The furniture throughout the house was ugly and mismatched . The high-backed cane chairs in the living room , arranged in a circle as though anticipating a group , looked uncomfortable , and were . After a while he heard her calling him and he came back in . " Sit , " she gestured to one of the stiff chairs . <p> " Viktor stepped out of the apartment to buy sugar for the cook , who was baking a cake , " she began . " We did n't see him again for thirteen years . That was just how things were in I942 . I was in the kitchen watching the cook make dinner . I sat near the stove , which did n't give enough heat to warm the high-ceilinged , two room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cook stirred her soup wearing a fox around her neck . The tail , head , and legs-dangling toward the pot of simmering leeks-looked like a hairy spider . " <p> He wanted to wash up , get something to drink . But he could n't move . " I remember the cook chopping the carrots and the onions . " " You had carrots and onions ? " " This was n't the famine . Anybody can grow carrots and onions . Even you , if you took an interest in anything besides your work . " " Do n't get personal , " he said . <p> " Who can get personal with you if not your own mother ? " " My girl friend . My girl friend can get personal . " " How well does your girl friend know you ? I could tell your girl friend things she did n't know to ask . " " Adriana , you tell her anything you want .

But I could n't concentrate . I closed my eyes and smelled the vegetables , the little bits of meat . I was sorry there was still enough meat to go around . I looked forward to the day the shortages would include all the meat . I 'd been a vegetarian for a couple of months . Of course I was a pacifist . It was a male pastime , this war . " At night Father came back from City Hall , where he worked as a judge . Remember , your grandfather was a judge . An important man . The cake was for his birthday , but everyone soon forgot about it . By that time everyone knew something was wrong .

She checked the hospitals , the secret police , friends in the underground . By the time she came home , Father 'd gone out again to confer with his contacts . He returned late , but Mother and I were still awake . He 'd learned something . Viktor had been arrested . Not for buying sugar on the black market . For trying to cross the border a few miles away . They 'd taken him to the capital . There was nothing we could do . We had to get some sleep . Even during a war , people slept . <p> " Years later , my brother came back . By then we were living in New Jersey . He spent most of that time in Siberia . It did n't do him much good . " The darkness was now complete . The howl of a dog suddenly made Alex feel they 'd slid out of space , into another world . New Jersey had folded into a deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 've heard all this . " <p> " I doubt it . Anyway , you have n't heard the one about the prostitute . " He sat down again . He had n't heard about the prostitute , that was true . He looked into the blank television screen . Adriana was addicted to game shows : " Jeopardy , " " The Match Game , " " Hollywood Squares . " She loved Alex Trebek . <p> " They may still be around , the people who arrested my brother . They were no older than him . Who ages faster : the prisoner or the guard ? The prisoner lives lean and never worries about having a roof overhead . Meanwhile , the guard 's life is all worry : about the prisoner escaping , about his wife sleeping around with the other guards , who 're always making jokes . My brother said he never dreamed about escaping . He said he did n't dream at all . He must have dreamed . Did you ever ask him about his dreams ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never mind . I 'll ask him in heaven . He does n't have Jesus , I 'm sure of that , though he goes to church with me sometimes . I watch him thinking about his next drink . " " What about the prostitute ? " Alex asked . <p> " I knew she 'd interest you . It 's my story , I 'll tell it . Did I ever mention the dances on Friday ? In the hall on Second Avenue , your father and I went-across from Filmore East . I came to hate that street of music-not the whores on the corner at midnight when we walked to our cars ; they were fine , people trying to get by . During the war many women took that route . They had reasons . Some did it for money , for others it was a way to stop thinking about husbands , brothers , sons , and fathers . Or a way to get revenge . <p> " But there 's one night in Vienna , before we went to the displaced persons camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train station , maybe your father . I started talking to this girl . She was eighteen , younger . She had green eyes , red hair , nice lips . How old was I ? Twenty at most . My German was n't good but I wanted to know . I could tell right away what she was , her blouse was open , and her lips were violent as sunsets seemed in those days . One of her legs was in a cast . I asked her why she did what she did , and about her leg . She did n't get angry . It must have been a quiet night , or maybe she was already done , the meter was off . <p> " She told me how boring everything was , the war , her life , the men she was with . Little tormented her ; nothing surprised her . Nothing caught her unprepared , no man made her heart beat faster , no dawn left her wondering what turns life might take . Her life had no seasons , she said . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought he was making fun of her and he did n't hit her back . Instead , he spent the night . He had a pencil mustache , she said . Looked British , though of course he was German . Turned out , he was a paratrooper . <p> " The next morning he invited her to go sky diving . She 'd never been in a plane , much less used a parachute , but she 'd always wanted to touch a cloud . He swore there was nothing to it , and because they were all drinking-during the war , most everyone was drunk most of the time-he had some friends take them up . It was a clear bright cloudless day . There were a few other girls , a few other soldiers . " As she put on the parachute , she felt her heart pounding at last , her body recognizing the madness , even if her mind denied it , and then she and her friend jumped out of the airplane together , holding hands . At a signal from him , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . She remembered the moment hers burst against the blue sky with a whump , yanking her up so she had to let go of his hand . <p> " She said she heard him scream : What should I do ? What should I do ? ' In German . She said if she had a knife she would have cut the ropes of her chute-instead , she watched the earth grow larger , and thought how beautiful it was , and when she landed , she broke her leg . She never saw him again . That was all for that . " Then she asked if my war had been different , and I had to answer no , not by much . " 5 <p> The overhead bulb in his room was burned out but the one table lamp was enough . He hardly needed that-the dark paper was like a second skin , the ceiling a lid on his soul . He and his brother had grown up here . He hung his shirts and pants in a closet bulging with his father 's old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-foot silk screen of his father 's face done from a photograph . The stern , thick-browed eyes were neutralized by the comic-book colors Alex had used : dayglo pinks and tangerines . There was a connection between family pictures and the posters of dictators , he 'd concluded , even as he got better at portraits . Lately , however , his imagination felt cramped-as he himself did . He worked to reach the bottom of his breath . Not home an hour and already he felt in a panic . He reached for his travel kit and a pill . <p> The apartment too held its breath , unsure how to respond . He felt the room hesitate around him . He looked for a way to break the silence . Though there was no one to talk to . Not true , not true , the air seemed to say . He thought of Adriana 's ghosts . He , more than Paul , sensed the presences . The boys ' favorite game had been funeral parlor . In the hallway leading to the bathroom sat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ocean . It was now a chest for clothes out-of-season , large enough for the children to crawl into and hide in , which , for a period , they did nightly . They took turns being dead . Alex would lift the light yellow lid and slip into the soft bed scented with mothballs , the smell rubbing against a nerve so that whoever lay in the box would be hyper-awake , with pins under the skin . Paul would be funeral director-cum-priest who 'd spout a spree of gibberish into the air as a benediction for the deceased . The dead one would lie there with his eyes closed , imagining that other place . Alex would close his eyes and fall into himself : it was dark , there was a scratching on the floor and fist-sized spiders with stiff hooped legs coated in bristles , each of which writhed lightly , the legs ending in enamel nails , and the mouth a pulsing malevolence , entered . He 'd shut his eyes , feel the vision materialize , while above him , his brother spoke words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters of transit . Once his brother shut the lid and the darkness was complete and then he recognized that heaven or hell depended on what filled your head , but how did some things get there in the first place ? Had he met these monsters around the house ? Meanwhile , the smell of mothballs slowly became suffocating and he 'd shout and when his brother did n't respond , he concluded that hell was a place where no one answered when you called . <p> He stood up and walked into Viktor 's room next door . Former site of the Museum of the Horrors of History . Now there was a large wooden cross above a single bed covered in a beige chenille quilt , a desk , and book shelves on cinder blocks crammed with volumes in several languages . There were also rows of black marbled notebooks in which Viktor the Spinner wrote journal entries , poems , stories . Alex pulled one of these and took it back to his room . He opened it to a handwritten title page : Contemptus Mundi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole aim of scripture is charity . <p> He suddenly felt very cut off-he 'd been in the city among strangers a long time . The novelty had faded . Now what he felt was relentless pressure , and the sensation that he was first of all among competitors rather than friends . Competition was something he did n't like facing anymore than seeing himself for who he was , or his mother for what she was . He had late night Catholic thoughts . The large cross was draped with an embroidered towel . He wanted to say a prayer , but who would he say it to ? He said it anyway . <p> That night he dreamed that he was out in the yard with Luz-Marie and his father when a bull jumped over the fence . LM and Lev ran into the house , leaving him alone with the animal , whose white horns were half as long as its body . Alex raced for his father 's black Chrysler by the river , with the bull right behind , but he slipped and fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The next morning , back home after breakfasting at the diner , he hung his dark blue pea jacket in a closet bursting with Adriana 's coats-a winter coat , a rain coat , a green coat , a leopard coat-who were all these women ? He left his umbrella to dry in the tub . His mother was lying on the couch . A woolen blanket , patterned with reindeer , was tucked up around her neck . She blinked at him , half-way back from a dream . <p> " Why do you listen ? " " What ? " " You come here for the stories . Do n't you have any of your own ? " " I do . I have plenty . I ca n't tell you them , of course . " " Why not ? " <p> " They 're not son to mother stories . That 's all . They 're not even father to son stories . They 're basically sinner to priest stories . But I do n't know any priests . " " Oh come on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to slip back to sleep . Then her lids rose lazily . <p> " I remember what happened when I did n't . When I made everything up myself , " Alex said . <p> " That 's not it , " answered Ada . " I know why . Because they 're better than yours . My stories are better than yours . " <p>
