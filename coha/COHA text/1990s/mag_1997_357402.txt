Such joy . It was the spring of 1985 , and President Reagan had just given Mother Teresa the Medal of Freedom in a Rose Garden ceremony . As she left , she walked down the corridor between the Oval Office and the West Wing drive , and there she was , turning my way . What a sight : a saint in a sari coming down the White House hall . As she came nearer , I could not help it : I bowed . " Mother , " I said , " I just want to touch your hand . " She looked up at me  --  it may have been one of God 's subtle jokes that his exalted child spent her life looking up to everyone else  --  and said only two words . Later I would realize that they were the message of her mission . " Luff Gott , " she said . Love God . She pressed into my hand a poem she had written , as she glided away in a swoosh of habit . <P> I took the poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free verse , 79 lines , and is called " Mother 's Meditation ( In the Hospital ) . " In it she reflects on Christ 's question to his apostles : " Who do you say I am ? " She notes that he was the boy born in Bethlehem , " put in the manger full of straw ... kept warm by the breath of the donkey , " who grew up to be " an ordinary man without much learning . " <P> Donkeys are not noble ; straw is common ; and it was among the ordinary and ignoble , the poor and sick , that she chose to labor . Her mission was for them and among them , and you have to be a pretty tough character to organize a little universe that exists to help people other people are n't interested in helping . <P> That 's how she struck me when I met her and as I watched her life . She was tough . There was the worn and weathered face , the abrupt and definite speech . We think saints are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints are steamrollers , and great saints are great organizers , great operators , great combatants in the world . <P> Once I saw her in a breathtaking act of courage . She was the speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington in 1995 . All the Washington Establishment was there , plus a few thousand born-again Christians , orthodox Catholics and Jews , and searchers looking for a faith . Mother Teresa was introduced , and she spoke of God , of love , of families . She said we must love one another and care for one another . There were great purrs of agreement . <P> But as the speech continued it became more pointed . She asked , " Do you do enough to make sure your parents , in the old people 's homes , feel your love ? Do you bring them each day your joy and caring ? " The baby boomers in the audience began to shift in their seats . And she continued . " I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For about 1.3 seconds there was complete silence , then applause built and swept across the room . But not everyone : the President and the First Lady , the Vice President and Mrs. Gore , looked like seated statues at Madame Tussaud 's , glistening in the lights and moving not a muscle . She did n't stop there either , but went on to explain why artificial birth control is bad and why Protestants who separate faith from works are making a mistake . When she was finished , there was almost no one she had n't offended . A U.S. Senator turned to his wife and said , " Is my jaw up yet ? "
