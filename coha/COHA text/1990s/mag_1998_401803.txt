Today 's bullies have moved beyond taunting and shoving to vicious , violent acts . When school officials look the other way , how can parents protect their kids from dangerous punks ? // It was 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon in November 1996 when 13-year-old Andy* walked out the door of Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View , CA , having stayed after classes for a tutoring session . The school is in a neighborhood of modest ranch houses , their lawns strewn with toys-the sort of place where parents feel comfortable letting their children play outside unattended . On his way home , Andy did n't have to fear gang shootings or drug dealers battling for turf . Yet the eighth grader had a different menace to worry about As Andy left school for the day , he found himself surrounded by five adolescent boys . The leader of the pack , a 14-year-old high school freshman named Jared , stood close to six feet tall and weighed 240 pounds , nearly twice as much as Andy . Jared grabbed Andy and held him so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Andy did n't come with them willingly , if they had to make him , things were going to get worse . Andy knew to take the threat seriously ; this was not his first encounter with Jared and company . Only a couple of weeks earlier , they had roughed up Andy at a party , then repeatedly held him underwater in a swimming pooljust for laughs . Too intimidated to cattle , and too fearful of retribution , Andy did n't say a word to his family about the harrowing encounter . Ask most parents to conjure up a schoolyard bully and they 'll remember the big kid who took other children 's lunch money or shoved them around when the teacher was n't looking-an endurable if unpleasant part of growing up . But they 'd scarcely picture a living nightmare like Jared , whose sadistic acts against fellow students ran to dangerous extremes . On this particular afternoon , Jared had plotted some really twisted fun . He and his buddies marched Andy to the mobile home where Jared lived with his mother , who at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worked . Along the way , they smacked their prev over the head with his loose-leaf binder . Once inside , one boy hastily cleared the furniture from the living room while the others handcuffed Andy . Jared started throwing punches , then all the boys joined in , using their fists and feet Over the next two hours , Andy , pleading for mercy all the while , was whipped with a chain , burned with candle wax , and shot in the back with a BB gun . With dusk approaching , a battered , bruised , and bleeding Andy was tossed out the door with a warning : Do n't tell anyone what happened to you . After staggering to a fast-food restaurant , Andy telephoned his father with a trumped-up tale of having been kidnapped and brutalized bv a band of men . Enter the police , who finally persuaded Andy to tell the truth . Jared and his cohorts were ( continued on page 182 ) promptly arrested and charged with kidnapping , assault , and torture . If Jared were an isolated example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bigger than most of us think . Seventeen percent of junior high school students admit to Ix:ing victims of in-sch ( ( ) l intimidation , physicsal assault , or robbery , according to a 1995 survey conducted hy the National ( , enter for Education Statistics . And authorities who 've investigated bullying suspect that the numbers are much higher . " Thirty to forty-five percent of kids in the suburbs I 'm familiar with tell us they 're being bullied , " says lI.cawood , KS , police officer Randy Wiler , who 's trained teachers and administrators at sch(X)ls throughout the Kansas City , KS , area on how to deal with the problem . What 's more , today 's bully is not just an inner-city phenomenon . Nine percent of suburban students reported being victims of violence , roughly the same proportion as in urban schools , according to a 1997 study hy the Reason Public Policy Institute , a Los Angeles-ha.sed think tank . The trend is escalating ; 54 percent of principals of suburban schools polled during 1988 to 1993 said violence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency of incidents up , but so is the level of ferocity . For example , in suburban Fresno , CA , in February 1996 , a high sch ( ool junior was surrounded hy a dozen other boys outside the lunchroom and beaten so severely that he suffered a concussion and temporary memory loss . One attacker subsequently was convicted of felony assault . Researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans found that 8 percent of suburban high school students thought it was okay to shoot someone who had offended or insulted them , and 20 percent thought it was appropriate to open fire if someone stole from them . Indeed , in the most extreme cases , bullies do graduate to killing . Witness the shooting deaths of four girls and a teacher outside a middle sch ( xil in Jonesboro , AR , last March , allegedly by two boys , 11 and 13 years old . The 13-yearold , Mitchell Johnson , was described by one schoolmate as a bully who " could pick on anybody that would let him . " Just two months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " an anger problem , " according to one classmate , allegedly shot his parents to death , after which , armed with a semiautomatic rifle and a backpack full of ammunition , he went to school and allegedly opened fire on his classmates , killing two and wounding 22 . How Children Turn Cruel Jared 's troubles surfaced early on . School records describe him as having " control problems " and being " defiant and belligerent " as far back as second grade . He was fanatical about the World Wrestling Federation and loved to act out the vi ( r lent fantasies he spent countless hours watching on lV . Jared 's mother , divorced from his father , attributes Jared 's troubles to a learning disability and severe attention deficit disorder . After the boy 's arrest , the California Youth Authority mental-health team assigned to his case said Jared had a propensity for dangerous behavior and was " an immature , intensely self-centered , and probably truly narcissistic individual who sees his own behavior as acceptable in every case . " Jared 's mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities argue , may have only contributed to the problem . " l he mentalhealth team theorized that " Jared 's mother has condoned and excused her son 's negative behaviors for many years , not holding him responsible and thereby exacerbating such behaviors . Both Jared and his mother believe that he is misunderstood and mistreated and is just fine the way he is . " Indeed , despite Jared 's eventual guilty plea to kidnapping , attempted torture , and " using force likely to cause great bodily harm , " his mother claims he was actually the victim-of teasing hy peers about his size and weight . One day four years ago , his mother says , " Jared came home and stood in front of our full-length mirror and said , " Mommy , am I scar . ' v ? " And I told him , " No , honey , you 're not scary , you 're just a big handsome hoy . ' " ( In a chilling footnote , after Jared 's arrest , his mother was arrested for allegedly ramming her truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case against her son . She eventually pled no contest to felony hit-and-run and was sentenced to 200 days in jail and five years of probation . She also had to pay $1,600 in restitution to the victim . ) The consequences of coddling bullies can be tragic . Last April , a 12-year-old Wayne , NJ , boy brought a pellet gun to school , hoping to scare a bully into leaving him alone ; he ended up suspended from school , then pled guilty to unlawfully possessing a weapon . And in 1993 , after several years of torment from bullies who 'd bang his head into lockers and trip him in hallways , 14-year-old Curtis Taylor of Burlington , IA , killed himself . When Schools Pass the Buck Clearly , kids ca n't he expected to solve a bull ing problem by themselves . The trouble is , parents ca n't count on schools to protect their children , either . Victims often charge that authorities do n't do enough to prevent bullying and sometimes even look the other way . For example , Jared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawenforcement officials who 've reviewed them , but the files contain no mention of attacks , and the principals at both middie schools he attended say they do n't recall any seriously violent incidents . All of which leads Rick Gardner , the Santa Clara County deputy district attorney who prosecuted Jared in juvenile court , to take a skeptical view . " When you 've got a kid with this many problems , it 's hard to believe that the sch ( xis did n't notice his violent behavior , " he says . And the parents of another of Jared 's victims recall that shortly after they went to the school to demand protection , Jared was abruptly transferred ; the principal contended that she discovered by chance that Jared actually lived within the boundary of a neighboring sch(x)l district . In fact , schools have been found to neglect documenting bullies ' attacks and to pass the problem along to someone else , according to the National School Safety Center 's Ronald Stephens , himself a former school administrator . " A lot of administrators do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fear of litigation and a reluctance to look bad . " Desperate parents have resorted to legal action . In Export , PA , Elizabeth Barcellino recalls the day in the fall of 1996 when her daughter , Christina , then a seventh grader at Franklin Regional Junior High School , came home from sch ( xl terrorized because two girls on the bus had tried to set her hair on fire . After Barcellino reported the attack to a school official , the situation worsened , according to a lawsuit filed by the Barcellinos and another family , the Clingers , whose tighter %%as also harassed . " Ihe lC I ) lIlies and their friends began harassing Christina and her classmate , Jessica ( linger , staring at them menacing ; ly and hitting and shoving them in school hallways . Instead of taking action to stop the bullies , the lawsuiit alleges , the school 's vice principal advised the girls to keep a low profile and wait for the bullies to move on to someone else . At another point , he sent the nvo girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually the school board cl assigned a teacher 's aide to escort Christina and Jessica to classes , but the bullies allegedly remained undaunted ; thev continued to harass the pair in the hallways even in the escort 's presence . Eventually , the parents of the victimized girls withdrew them from the school . ( A lawyer representing the scil district argued in court that a school does not have a legal duty to pn , tect students from other students . ) Like the Barcellinos and the Clingers , parents in other states have tried to pressure schools to take action by going to court . In Brooksville , FL , Al was aghast when his daughter , then 12 , came home from school in October 1996 holding an icepack to her head because she 'd been punched by a bully on the school bus . When the school failed to punish her attacker , Holm enrolled his daughter in a private school and filed a suit against the school district . Though the school suit is ongoing , the bully pled no contest to battery and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some parents , through trial and error , have found ways to work successfully with schools . Lydia Brown of Mansfield , TX , says that when her son , now 13 , first tolder he was being harassed by school bullies two years ago , she did n't grasp the severity of the situation . Instead , she did as many parents would : told her son to either fight back or ignore his tormentors . One day last March , after being chased home and pelted with rocks as he frantically tried to unlock the door , the normally nonviolent boy grabbed his BB gun and began shooting at the bullies in frustration . Later , he confided to his mother that he 'd considered suicide as an escape . Brown had five meetings with school officials but says that as far as she could tell little was done that made much difference . Citing school records ' confidentiality , officials would n't even tell her if the bullies had been disciplined . When her son moved on to junior high , Brown asked for a meeting with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a list of the hollies from the last school , " she recalls . " I told them , " If he has a problem with these kids , you know this is part of a pattern , not just an isolated thing . ' ' " The school 's principal , she says , let the bullies know that they were being watched to make sure they did n't pick on anyone in the future . At the start of the school year , there was at minor incident ; the principal promptly suspended the bullies for five days , and there have been no further problems . Meanwhile , in California , Jared 's case was well out Of the hands of school officials . A juvenile-court judge , citing Jared 's " horrendous conduct and misbehavior , " sentenced hill to a state youth authority prison . ( His companions were variously sentenced to reform schools and a local facility for juvenile offenders . ) " I hope , for the sake of his victims , Jared stays in prison for as long as possible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . She wo n't get her wish . Prosecutor Gardner says that as a juvenile , Jared is likely to serve no more than four vears behind bars-and possibly less . Gardner hopes the shock of incarceration will keep Jared from becoming one of the estimated 60 percent of childhood bullies who go on to commit adult crimes . But the prosecutor is n't optimistic : " Anybody who does n't have any empathy and tends to get enjoyment OUt of hurting other people-that sort of young person can grow Llp to become One Of your Charles Mansons , your Jeffrey Dahmer . They always present a risk . " <p>
