THERE WAS A MAN NAMED MCNEER who lived in my hometown of Arrow Catcher , Mississippi . I saw him only infrequently , though I knew his wife and two children . Mr. McNeer worked all night in a Rose Oil service station in a town ten miles away , and so he was rarely visible around the house . The four of them lived near the school at the end of a cottonfield in a prefab shack with peeling yellow paint . Mrs. McNeer was a tall , dopey-looking woman who operated a little store on the same property . The store had a gas pump and a few groceries , and she made pimento-cheese sandwiches to sell to schoolchildren at lunchtime . I was eleven years old . <p> The McNeers had a son a year younger than myself , John Wesleynamed after the founder of Methodism  --  and a daughter a couple of years older . Her name was Dixie Dawn . Their conspicuous names seemed a part of their tragedy . John Wesley looked like his mother , which is to say he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter was overweight and wore heavy makeup and had a pathetically angelic look about her . Although she was only thirteen she had large breasts . She sang in the Methodist Church choir and said she wanted to sing soprano " at the Met " when she graduated from high school . <p> I was embarrassed by the family 's appearance . In a way I hated them for it , and yet I felt a certain sorrow as well and wished they had better things . Often I wondered how a person lives his life as a part of such a family . I grieved for Dixie Dawn , and though she sang better than anyone I had ever known , I knew that she would get no closer to the Metropolitan Opera than a gas pump and a plate of cheese sandwiches at the end of a cotton row . <p> I rarely thought of the father at all , he was so seldom around . <p> And then one day as I was walking to the lot where I played baseball , I noticed that he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoe . He was drunk and dirty , wearing baggy , unzipped trousers . His big belly was hanging out from under a sleeveless undershirt . <p> Dixie Dawn had come outside at the moment I was passing and had brought something to her father , something cool to drink . <p> Then for no apparent reason she stood there near him among the cabbages and began to sing . It was music of some operatic sort , some aria I suppose , clear and foreign and completely surprising . <p> This spontaneous music infuriated Mr. McNeer . He began cursing Dixie Dawn and berating her and calling her names . I was standing across the street watching . They did not see me , though it would not have mattered ; he would have kept on in any case . <p> The abuse continued until Dixie Dawn was crying . Still it did not stop . Dixie Dawn was dressed in crisp seersucker , and though I hated her for her poverty and her fatness and her social ineptitude , she looked almost beautiful standing there among the cabbages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McNeer 's anger grew and grew , and the abuse became worse . Finally he walked towards her through the garden patch , and I was astonished to watch him strike Dixie Dawn over the head with the side of the hoe . <p> She staggered but did not fall . She turned to run . He followed and struck her many more times on the head and shoulders and back . He flung the hoe behind him and ran and caught her and stopped her . He was heavy and strong . He spun her around to face him and he held her by the shoulders . Her hair was black with blood . Her crisp dress was ruined . He shook her until she was as limp as a rag doll . <p> I could not hear his words , only the anger in his voice . Finally he let her go and she ran into the house crying . <p> I hurried away from the scene , embarrassed and frightened . Before I was completely out of sight of them I turned and looked back and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily to her husband . I did n't wait to see more . <p> I hung around the vacant lot and waited for someone to show up to play ball . For a long time I was alone . I tossed the ball up in the air and caught it with my fielder 's mitt . There was not much else to do . I thought of Dixie Dawn getting cracked over the head with the hoe . It was summer and the sun was beating down on the Delta . Fields of cotton plants stretched like long green carpets in all directions from where I stood . I could smell the cotton flowers on the wind . On the street a mule-drawn wagon trundled past , driven by a black man . The wagon was filled with blocks of ice and covered with a tarp . The ice melted and water poured out in streams beneath the wagon wheels . <p> At last another boy showed up , Roy Dale Conroy . Roy Dale was a white-trash child . He had milk-white skin and large coppery freckles . His hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister . He spit constantly , ptooey ptooey ptooey . It was a habit , a compulsion I would say . <p> Roy Dale was worthless as a playmate . He had no ball or glove or bat . He relied on the charity of others . He did n't really know how to play ball anyway . He would put the bat between his legs and make sexual jokes . Or he would put the ball down his pants and strut around . Nobody wanted to play with Roy Dale . <p> He said , " Hey , Sugar . " Ptooey ptooey ptooey . <p> I said , " Hey , Roy Dale . " <p> He said , " Throw me the ball . I want to show you something . " Ptooey . <p> I said , " Mr. McNeer just beat Dixie Dawn over the head with a hoe . " <p> Roy Dale went ptooey ptooey ptooey . <p> I said , " She was bleeding and everything . " <p> He said , " Did she let you see her tits ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along and caught up with me . <p> He said , " Hey , man , just kidding . Take a joke . " <p> I kept walking . <p> He said , " No kidding , let me see the ball . Just for a second . I 'll give it right back . " <p> We walked along towards my home . Roy Dale kept nagging me about the baseball . <p> I said , " She wants to sing opera songs . " <p> He said , " I 'll give you a quarter to let me see the ball . " <p> We cut down an alley , a short way to my house . There was a weedy ditch with water running through it . Roy Dale said , " Hole up . " He climbed down in the ditch and scrambled around , this way and that , grabbing at something in the weeds and finally cornering it in the water . He stepped in the ditchwater and did n't seem to notice that his shoes were wet . Finally he caught the thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ping-pong ball . <p> We were in sight of my house now . <p> Roy Dale said , " What shall I do with it ? " Talking about the mouse . <p> I said , " Let it go , Roy Dale . " <p> He said , " I do n't know ... " Teasing me . <p> I said , " Here , take it , take the ball . " I held it out to him . <p> He said , " H 'm . I do n't really need the ball anymore . " <p> I said , " Do n't hurt the mouse , Roy Dale . C'm on , take the ball . " <p> He held the mouse tight in one hand . Its head stuck up between his fingers . It was tiny as a button , the little head , and yet all the features were distinct , the big ears and pointy face and little whiskers and frightened eyes like bright punctuation . It had little mouse-teeth , small as sand crystals . <p> Roy Dale took the baseball from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder which one I could throw farther . " <p> I said , " You can have the ball . I 'll give it to you . Let the mouse go . I 'm telling you Dixie Dawn was bleeding all over the place . I thought he was going to kill her . " <p> He said , " Do . you mean it ? I can have the ball ? " <p> I said , " Just let the mouse go . " <p> He said , " You 're lying , " and made me think he was about to hurl the mouse to the ground . <p> I said , " No , really . You can have it . " <p> He said , " I do n't want your fucking ball . " He dropped the ball into the ditchwater and tossed the mouse underhand out in front of him in my direction . It was spinning in the air . I tried to catch the mouse , but I missed it . It hit my hand and then my thigh and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not badly injured . In a couple of seconds it got its bearings and scuttled off into the weeds . <p> Roy Dale picked the ball up out of the water and dried it against his pants and handed it to me . " Good as new , " he said . <p> I said , " Thanks . " <p> He said , " You might as well not lie to me about being your friend . " <p> Roy Dale went his way and I went mine . <p> My mother was in the kitchen making homemade noodles and chicken broth . She hated noodles and broth , but it was the only thing my father would eat when he was drinking . <p> I walked into the kitchen and said , " Roy Dale caught a mouse and let it go . " <p> She said , " To my mind a body needs a balanced diet . " <p> I said , " Mr. McNeer hit Dixie Dawn over the head with a hoe and made her bleed . " <p> Mama said , " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me with sadness , her hands still covered with flour . I was glad I had told her . <p> I said , " She did n't do nothing . He just started beating her with the hoe . " <p> She said , " Anything . She did n't do anything . " And then she said , " Those poor sad people . " <p> Soon after the incident with the hoe Mrs. McNeer began a campaign to make her children 's life happy . She surprised local children on the street by giving them money . She would say , " My treat ! " She volunteered to " help out " in the youth groups of every church in town . She made sandwiches for Methodist kids , she hired a truck for the Presbyterian hayride , she taught in the Baptist Vacation Bible School , she folkdanced with the Episcopalians . <p> Her unhappy children were always there with her . Dixie Dawn was forced to sing solos . John Wesley , who was tone deaf , stood around with his knuckles on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town grew to fear and despise Dixie Dawn and John Wesley all the more . <p> The saddest event in the attempt to conscript an army against the McNeer children 's misery was a birthday party for Dixie Dawn . I should say " birthday party " in quotation marks , since it was still summer and nobody 's birthday at all . Dixie Dawn 's birthday was not until February . <p> The party was elaborate . Maybe the most elaborate single event in white-trash history . Mrs. McNeer had prepared for forty or more children . She worked day and night for weeks . She strung crepe paper streamers from every available place , four separate colors of crinkly paper twisted together in a bright rope looping and swagging from house to store , from tree to bush . The yard was practically canopied in streamers . <p> Mrs. McNeer had rented a tent in case of rain and had set it up and rolled up its sides and placed long cloth-covered tables beneath it . On the tables were foods that most of the children of Arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches cut with a cooky cutter , pickled herring , olives , smoked oysters , raw vegetables with a mustard dip , smoked bluefish and trout and salmon , even a liver pate . There was no sign of any food that a Mississippi child might have actually been able to eat : cornbread and turnip greens , cold baked sweet potatoes , pimento-cheese sandwiches on light bread , fried chicken and slaw and watermelon . The food before us was designed to prove that nobody in attendance at this party , host or guest , could ever be accused of white-trashery . There were two large cakes . One of them said , You 're a Big Girl Now . The other said , Let 's Boogie Down . There was a banner that said Happy Birthday , and another that said Let 's Have a Party . <p> All across the lawn there were areas arranged for various games . Card games here , board games there , blindfold games , running games , croquet , badminton , every game you can think of , all over the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tooters and squeakers and clickers and tasseled hats and sheriff 's badges and painters ' caps and small magic tricks . Handcuffs , fingercuffs , whoopee cushions , hand buzzers , squirting flowers , leaky fountain pens , play money , sneezing powder , itching powder , loaded dice , Mexican jumping beans , nose flutes , nose putty , glow-in-the-dark teeth , riding crops . There were Japanese lanterns and one million helium-filled balloons on strings . <p> Most impressive of all was the ice cream . There was enough ice cream for a hundred hungry people . It was homemade and completely fresh . Fresh strawberry , fresh peach , fresh fig , I do n't know what else , but fresh , all of it fresh . Mrs. McNeer lifted the freezing cold lid of each metal canister and the perfect cream pulled into a long , smooth curl . The clop-clop of hooves sounded in my mind as I imagined the ice wagon leaving off its entire load at the McNeer doorstep so that this perfection might be accomplished . <p> The problem with all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the party , no one else . <p> The afternoon was hot . We sat for a long time in new lawn chairs , me , Mrs. McNeer , Dixie Dawn ( swollen with tears ) , and John Wesley , his hairline threatening to grow down over his eyes . All of us sat in the chairs and waited and waited for someone else to appear . <p> I could not even hate my parents for sending me here . I had not been sent . I came to this terrible place because I had to . ! came because I had seen Mr. McNeer beat Dixie Dawn with the hoe . For that reason only . I was the only true guilty-responsible witness to the sadness of their lives . <p> The minutes were hours , as we waited . Mrs. McNeer said , " No one wants to be first at a party . " And she said , " Who said small-towners do n't know how to be fashionably late ? " And she said , " Where could all those other scamps be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , " Their parents practically promised me . " <p> No one came . The afternoon lengthened . The sun moved down the sky . Mrs. McNeer made a few futile phone calls . Finally there was nothing more to say . <p> One other person did come to the party . After a long while Roy Dale Conroy showed up . I am certain he had not been invited . He seemed only to happen past the house and to see us in the lawn chairs . He had been wading in a swamp and was wet to his knees and smelled like fish . <p> I had brought a small gift , a jar of hard candy wrapped in tissue paper . Roy Dale had brought no regular gift , of course , but he tried to give Dixie Dawn a quarter and a dime he found in his pocket . <p> Dixie Dawn refused to take the money , and then she refused to take the gift-wrapped package from me as well . <p> Mrs. McNeer insisted that she take the candy and then thank me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later Roy Dale offered the money to John Wesley , who took it and grinned like an ape and thanked him sincerely . <p> We played as many of the games as the five of us could play . We ate as much of the food as we could eat . We filled up bags of party favors to take home . Gallons of ice cream went to waste . We sang " Happy Birthday " to Dixie Dawn , and she cried like the Missouri and went inside and lay down on her bed under a fan . <p> And so it was over . Or I thought so . <p> There was one more event on Mrs. McNeer 's bizarre , pathetic agenda , final punctuation to this bad day . A campout , a sleepover . Boys only . That was the way Mrs. McNeer put the proposition to us . Good news ! What fun ! It 's all decided ; your parents have agreed . A pup tent ! Have you ever heard of anything so wonderful , so fun ! You ca n't escape ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I say about my life that explains what it meant for me to lie hostage in a tent with these two companions  --  Roy Dale and John Wesley ? <p> None of it is important . Only this day . The smell of gasoline at the pump , of souring cream , of defoliant and crisp leaves , a wagon pulling ice , noodles , broth , alcohol . <p> When the sun was down at last , the birthday party that had begun earlier in this same day seemed to have been going on for centuries . Mrs. McNeer lighted a couple of lanterns in the backyard . She spread clean , soft quilts on the bottom of the tent and laid out cheap sleeping bags on top of those . She opened up both ends of the tent so that we could catch a breeze , and dropped mosquito netting over the ends just in case . <p> I forgave her for the lies she told to get us there . I doubted whether she had even bothered to lie to Roy Dale 's parents . Probably he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone 's knowing or caring whether he came home that night . <p> We talked for a while in the tent , the three of us , John Wesley , Roy Dale , and me . Roy Dale said that he would teach us how to jack-off if we wanted him to . John Wesley said , " Oh boy ! Yeah , sure , that would be great ! Thanks ! " But nothing ever came of the offer , and I was relieved . <p> We lay quiet for a while . We removed the mosquito netting and looked at the sky . <p> I said , " That 's the North Star . " <p> Roy Dale . said , " You 're lying . " <p> He was right . I did n't know one star from another . <p> Roy Dale said , " I wish I had a cigarette . " <p> It was a soft night . I was beginning to be glad I was here . I told Roy Dale and John Wesley the story of the day when I was five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the neighborhood . I made the memory sound dramatic . " No one was allowed on the streets , " I said . " A mad dog . A rabid dog . " I told them that the air was filled with the fragrance of rotting persimmons and the sounds of wasps drunk on the ferment . This part was not true ; I only told it to make the story sound better . <p> I thought Roy Dale would say , " You 're lying . " <p> Instead he said , " I remember that . " <p> I said , " You do ? " <p> He said , " I remember that mad dog . " <p> I said , " You 're lying . " <p> He said , " I saw it . It could n't hardly walk , it was so crippled up with the disease . " <p> I said , " Tell the truth . " <p> He said , " There was ropes of spit stringing out of its mouth . Its eyes looked like busted marbles . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " A man with a rifle killed it . It was a shepherd dog . I saw a bright red bullet gash in its side . Mock it down : I watched that dog breathe its last breath . " <p> We lay in the night silence and watched the stars . I wished I knew the names of all the stars and all the constellations . Or even just one of them . <p> I said , " Jeeziz . " <p> Roy Dale still smelled like fish , but it was a good smell . The earth and its waters . <p> John Wesley spoke then . Soft , little , faraway , ape-boy voice . He said , " The man who killed the dog was my daddy . " <p> For a while there was only silence . For a while neither Roy Dale nor I even looked in his direction . <p> John Wesley was not lying . His father had been the man who killed the mad dog and saved lives . <p> In a while Roy Dale was still ; maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then maybe I did fall asleep , and not long afterwards I woke up again and John Wesley was crawling out of the tent . John Wesley was barefoot and wearing only his underwear . <p> He was headed towards the house . <p> I shook Roy Dale . I said , " Look . " <p> John Wesley went inside the house through the back screened door , and we saw him through the window , in the kitchen with his sad mother beneath a light bulb hanging from a cord . They sat together at the kitchen table amidst the birthday wreckage , and though we could not have heard them in any case , I think they did not speak . <p> And so we lay back in the tent , on our sleeping bags , and did not speak either . We pretended to be asleep , though I was not , and I am sure Roy Dale was not . After a while John Wesley came back to the tent and crawled in between the two of us and cried quietly until he slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then to Roy Dale , as well . The birthday party was over . <p> I suppose there is one more thing to tell . For many years , after I was grown and no longer lived in Mississippi , I told this story to my friends . And when I told it , I always added one detail that was not true . <p> I always said that after we had settled down and had drifted off to sleep beneath the canvas roof of the tent , I was awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of Dixie Dawn 's sweet , pure , angelic voice in song . I said that beneath the bright stars her voice was a crisp spirit , a lyrical , hopeful pause in the terrible drama of our narrow lives . I said  --  and even as I invented this I believed it  --  I said that in the foreign-language music of her song my ears and my heart opened up to a world larger and more generous than the world of my parents and our geography . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I ever made up such a thing . It is not true , of course . Dixie Dawn did not wake up that night , as far as I know . She lay in her bed in a hard , deliberate sleep , where song had put her and from which song could never draw her out . These many years later I am happy not to know what that interior , silenced music later became in that innocent child  --  what rage or desolation or passionate utterance or prayer for transformation . <p> <p> By LEWIS NORDAN <p>
