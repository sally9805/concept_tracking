<p> Consider this story : A middle-aged man , repulsed by the adultery and promiscuity of his society , and determined never to be cuckolded , is about to reap the benefits of the long-range plan he devised . <p> The woman he intends to wed is , in fact , the young girl he took as his ward many years before . Born to a poor peasant woman , the child was adopted by the wealthy man in early childhood , and then sent to a convent , where she was completely sheltered and shaped to be sweet , submissive , and more or less mindless . Determined to marry a chaste and incorruptible young woman , he was willing to wait until he 'd raised the perfect one . <p> No , this is not a thinly veiled take on the marriage of Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn . It is the plot line of Moliere 's scandalous and highly controversial 17th century comedy , " The School for Wives , " which opens Monday night at the Court Theatre in a production staged by Hungarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris in 1662 , where Moliere was under the patronage of King Louis XIV , is one of Marton 's favorites . Over the past 18 years , his productions of it  --  in Budapest and Helsinki , Finland , as well as at the Habima Theatre in Israel ( where it has been running in repertory for more than three years ) , and at the Actors ' Theatre in Louisville , Ky.  --  have all met with great success . But he was eager to try his hand at it one more time . <p> " I think " The School for Wives ' is one of the masterpieces of dramatic literature , " Marton said . " Certainly it is one of Moliere 's best plays  --  on a par with ' The Misanthrope ' and ' Tartuffe . ' And each time I direct it I think I get closer to its heart , go deeper in my analysis . " <p> This time around , Marton , who is using the scintillating rhymed translation by Richard Wilbur , also has new research to draw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff of which paparazzi dreams are made . <p> " In traditional European productions of this play , Arnolphe , the principal character ( to be portrayed here by Kevin Gudahl ) , is generally played as an older , rather stupid man , and his ward , Agnes ( newcomer Judy Greer ) , is bright and wonderful , " the director explained . <p> " But I recently read a new biography of Moliere that sent me back to the play . I realized that Arnolphe is only 44 , just a few years older than Moliere was at the time " The School for Wives ' had its premiere . That premiere coincided with Moliere 's marriage to Armande Bejart , who was 16 . And on top of all this , Moliere played the role of Arnolphe and Armande played Agnes . " <p> Some say that Armande was the younger sister of Madeleine Bejart , Moliere 's longtime mistress and the leading lady in his acting company . But others , particularly Moliere 's enemies at court , claimed she was Madeleine 's daughter , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that original production made the play seem even more impudent and provocative than it is , " said Marton . <p> As he reread the play , the director became increasingly intrigued by its autobiographical nature . Not surprisingly , the initial Paris production and its real-life parallels caused a huge scandal . The King ultimately came to Moliere 's defense . <p> " The confessive , subjective monologues in the play 's final scene also happen to be some of the most beautiful ever written about the pain of love and about the futility of possessiveness and isolation , " said Marton . <p> " Arnolphe becomes a laughingstock . And Horace , the rather dim-witted and narcissistic young man who has wooed Agnes despite all Arnolphe 's efforts at isolating her , succeeds . Yet Arnolphe is correct to hate the society in which he lives , where everyone lies , where human connections do n't work anymore , where marriages are in crisis , where everyone knows who is sleeping with whom and who is cheating on whom . Of course his solution to these problems is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has directly widely in the United States , as well as throughout Europe , knows that American audiences bring different attitudes to the play than those , for example , in Hungary . <p> " There is more sensitivity here to the whole issue of women , and less patience with the male view of women , " he said . " From one point of view the rules of marriage that Arnolphe dictates to Agnes during the play are absolutely hilarious . And many men , even in this country , probably think the same way . On the other hand , if you really consider how Arnolphe has handled Agnes from the age of 4 , there are many who might say he should be held on criminal charges . " <p> Marton is returning to work at the Court just two seasons after he triumphed here with his effervescent production of " The Play 's the Thing , " the Viennese romantic comedy . At home in Budapest he has served for nearly two decades as head of Budapest 's Vigszinhaz or Comedy Theatre , a huge operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has staged many new works , including " Push Up , " a look at military life , and " The Attic , " a musical . <p> One of the biggest hits in Budapest these days is " The Last Dance , " an intensely personal , completely dialogue-free look at the past 70 years of Hungarian history . Created by Marton , and based on memories of his own family , it requires 22 actors , 350 costumes , and 300 wigs and moustaches . <p> Although Marton 's theater in Budapest still receives about 50 percent of its funding from the state , he says the major problem facing theaters all over Europe now is not so much money as it is the continuation of culture . <p> " There is a real crisis in terms of how to keep theater alive for the next generation , " said the director . " We know we have to attract larger audiences . At the same time the theater 's political braveness during the Communist era does n't count anymore . So we keep asking ourselves : What attracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet at the same time not give in to commercialism ? <p> " To create good art , and at the same time respect a large audience , is the ancient duty of the theater . The Greeks and Romans and Elizabethans did it . We ca n't just exist for a limited audience . " <p> " The School for Wives " runs Monday through Feb. 1 at Court Theatre , 5535 S. Ellis .
