<p> A FRIEND of mine likes to repeat an anecdote about the summer he worked in a bread factory . Working in the bread factory was one of the best jobs he ever had , he says : no worries , good pay , and , from time to time , a chance to reflect on human nature . <p> The highlight of the day in the bread factory , he says , was when the man in blue overalls appeared , unannounced , at the end of the assembly line . Suddenly , everyone would chant : " Here comes the magic man , here comes the magic man . " With that , the magic man would mount a platform over the assembly line , push a few buttons , and bingo - what was once one brand of bread , complete with blue labels and a smiling maiden , was suddenly another , with smiling children and an entirely different label . <p> " So now I always smile when I look at the bread shelf at the grocery store , " my friend says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the bread is the same . It might be ' new and enriched , ' or just ' enriched , ' but it 's the same bread . The only difference is that the magic man would push different buttons . " <p> The anecdote has a certain relevance to the life of Yitzhak Rabin , who has been portrayed over the past week as a man transformed . We marvel at the way he changed - from the leader of an underground movement to the head of an army , from ambassador to prime minister , from " Mr. Security " to the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize . But in truth , Yitzhak Rabin never changed at all . He was - first , last , and always - an Israeli patriot . And therein lies the real tragedy of his death . <p> Rabin was the magic man . He grew up as a young Zionist and , after a flirtation with a life as a farmer , joined the Zionist Palmach , the Jewish underground army . Over the next 30 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Syrians , Jordanians , and Palestinians . In the end , he would have fought even those in Israel who , in his estimation , threatened the life of the nation . But he was always the same man : Israel and its well-being came first . Over the years , he proved to be its most ardent and successful defender . <p> I learned this firsthand just after the signing of the Oslo Accord , when I was given the task of writing a short address to be used to introduce Rabin to an audience of Arab journalists . I wrote that he had traveled the long road from confrontation to peace and that , while he had made his reputation as a warrior , he had changed . <p> He was visibly upset by the introduction and shifted uncomfortably in his chair . I interpreted his discomfort as a sign that he did not want his victories recounted to an audience who might have other views of the same conflicts . <p> After his speech and the press conference that followed , he set me straight . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have : " I have not changed at all , " he said . " I am the same man now as I ever was . " And with that he walked away . It was only in studying that remark over the next few hours that I came to understand what he meant . Yitzhak Rabin 's choice for peace was not an attempt to redress historical wrongs ; defending Israel could never be wrong no matter what form it took . <p> I have never worked in a bread factory and so can not support my beliefs about Rabin with such a colorful anecdote . But I have studied history . One of my favorite stories in US history is of Abraham Lincoln , wrestling with the question of emancipation . We now know that Lincoln thought of the Union first and slavery second : " My paramount object in this struggle , " Lincoln said of the Civil War , " is to save the Union , and it is not either to save or to destroy slavery . If I could save the Union without freeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could save the Union by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that . What I do about slavery , and the colored race , I do because I believe it helps to save the Union ; and what I forbear , I forbear because I do not believe it would help save the Union . " <p> Yitzhak Rabin would have been comfortable with Lincoln 's reasoning : If waging an unremitting war with the Palestinians would secure Israel 's future , he would have done that . If he could have secured Israel 's future by making peace with some of them , but not with others , he would have done that . If making peace with all of them would secure Israel 's future , then he would do that . <p> A year before the signing of the Oslo Accord , I asked Rabin if he would ever negotiate with PLO leader Yasser Arafat . " Never , " he said . " Never , never , never . " Given this , I assumed that when he appeared on the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian rights , that something profound must have happened to him . He must have changed . But he had not . Only the circumstances had changed ; Rabin remained the same . Israel was Yitzhak Rabin 's guiding principle . He would have done anything to defend Israel and to secure its future . He would even shake Mr. Arafat 's hand . <p> Rabin was absolutely single-minded when it came to defending his nation . But his commitment to defending Israel does not detract from his special role as a peacemaker . He believed Zionism could only succeed if it was true to its fundamental moral principle - that the Jewish people would never oppress another . He said this again and again . For Rabin , Israel was not simply the Jewish state , the culmination of Zionism 's dream , it was a Jewish home . He knew the difference . <p> I did not know Rabin well and only spoke with him on three occasions . I interviewed him , briefly , only once . But I know this : Rabin believed that Israel could play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as an example to other nations . He believed that the Jewish people had a special mission . That they were truly the chosen people . Chosen to show the world that even a people with a history of 2,000 years of ceaseless war and persecution could make peace with their enemies . If the Israeli people could not , what chance would there be for the rest of the world ? <p> Rabin 's assassination does n't make Israel more secure , but less . What a terrible irony it is that a man who fought in all of Israel 's wars was gunned down by a man who fought in none ; that a man who sacrificed his life to build a home for the Jewish people was murdered by a fanatic who wants a larger state ; and that a man who believed Palestinians and Israelis " are destined to live together in the same land " was murdered by a Jew who can not live with another Jew - let alone a Palestinian . Rabin 's killer must have concluded that Rabin had changed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have known better : Rabin lived and died as a warrior . He did n't change , he adopted new methods . <p> Rabin was murdered by a man who holds his hatred of others above his love of country . It is this denial of the future that makes the murder of
