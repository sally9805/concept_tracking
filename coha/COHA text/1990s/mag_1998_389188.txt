Section : U.S. News By patiently waiting for a mistake , Clinton won the diplomatic support to back his use of military might <p> The story line has played out before . The world and Saddam Hussein go to the brink . Leaders condemn Iraq and demand unhampered weapons inspections . Iraqi officials don military fatigues , vow defiance , and hurl epithets at Washington . American soldiers bid farewell to tearful families as they file aboard transport planes for the long flight to the Persian Gulf . In Israel , gas masks are distributed as a precaution against chemical attack . Then something intervenes : a concession , a diplomatic smokescreen , a reason not to take the final step that so many abhor . <p> This time is different . Last week , the ambiguity evaporated . The Clinton administration  --  including the Pentagon  --  overcame its past indecision and resolved to punish Saddam 's regime . The Americans were supported  --  sometimes prompted  --  by an ad hoc coalition whose voices ranged from British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's stout assertion that his country stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quiet but powerful pronouncement of the gulf Arab states as well as Egypt and Syria that Saddam was on his own . The French finally boiled over at Saddam 's gamesmanship . Even the Russians could only mumble a perfunctory dissent . Not since the eve of the 1991 ground invasion has the world been more united in its opposition to the mustachioed dictator from central casting , and most agreed that Saddam has only himself to blame . <p> President Clinton has come to believe that Saddam is by turns looney and lucid . " The president considers him someone who has some understanding of his situation but who tends to overplay and miscalculate , " says a top U.S. official . The Iraqi leader was far more clearsighted last February when he won sympathy for his appeal to see sanctions against Iraq lifted and splintered the international coalition . Much criticized at the time , the administration decided to stand down . <p> Months of patience paid off and Saddam overplayed his hand , to the point where last week the American policy debate had shifted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  spookspeak for targeting the dictator and the powerful Revolutionary Guard units that keep him in power . ( The decision was not to go after Saddam personally , but American policy makers would have no regrets if some ordnance happened to land on him . ) <p> The changed power equation has allowed Clinton to deal from a position of strength . Unlike past showdowns , he flatly ruled out further diplomatic compromises to delay a fight , insisting that only a complete Iraqi reversal would suffice . Saddam said he welcomed diplomatic intervention , but only as long as it met his demands for an end to economic sanctions . No one was buying . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright phoned United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to say she saw no point in another last-ditch mission to Baghdad . Annan agreed . <p> No light . This latest encounter began to unfold on July 17 , when , at the 30th anniversary of the coup that brought his Baath party to power , Saddam declared that 1998 would be the year sanctions end . As they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see no " light at the end of the tunnel " of sanctions , which have choked the Iraqi economy as they ban oil sales except those used to buy food and medicine . The rational explanation for Saddam 's seemingly irrational actions is that his regime now has little to lose in a new clash . <p> But Saddam 's unprecedentedly brazen challenge to the arms inspections that he had formally accepted  --  as recently as February in a deal with Annan  --  proved a diplomatic windfall for the United States . Saddam had at last turned many of the critics of military strikes in the Arab world and on the U.N . Security Council into reluctant supporters of U.S. policy . As if on cue , Saddam barred the U.N . ' s surprise weapons searches in early August and then expanded the ban to all inspections on October 31 . Even erstwhile supporters at the U.N . were flabbergasted . " We did n't automatically pull the trigger , " said a senior State Department official . " That helped rebuild the coalition . " <p> By last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer necessary . Further warnings and delay would destroy American credibility . One gulf Arab diplomat said his government was sick of unfulfilled administration threats and wanted an attack massive enough to end Saddam 's rule . ( He doubts that will happen . ) The essence of that country 's private argument : Put up or shut up . President Clinton seemed to accept that choice . " A failure to respond could embolden Saddam to act recklessly , signaling to him that he can with impunity develop these weapons of mass destruction or threaten his neighbors , " he told a Veterans Day gathering at Arlington National Cemetery . His secretary of defense , William Cohen , framed the terms of the confrontation in clear , high-stakes language : " The U.N . ' s credibility is on the line and , I think , U.S. credibility as well . " <p> Still , there remains no shortage of skepticism  --  inside the administration and around the world  --  about what even a " significant " ( Cohen 's word ) strike would accomplish . Clinton and his national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saddam 's ability to reconstitute weapons of mass destruction and to deny him the capacity to threaten his neighbors or the world . By that vague standard , it may be easy to declare victory after a few days of missile barrages and bombing runs . But there is little likelihood this would solve the weapons problem . " Airstrikes are by no means the preferred instrument for arms control , " said one senior military official . <p> Yet the new consensus creates an opportunity to inflict deep wounds on the Iraqi regime , with the U.S. military identifying a plethora of targets . Since the same Iraqi leadership organs that underpin Saddam 's rule are " engaged in concealment " of weapons facilities , says one official familiar with U.N . inspections , " they 're legitimate targets . " That includes the 26,000-strong Special Republican Guard that protects Saddam , the Special Security Organization , and his power base in Tikrit . <p> After Saddam ? But the American determination to act leaves unresolved several dilemmas that have bedeviled Iraq policy for years . The first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the operation . U.S. officials are of two minds on the question . Albright and others say they look forward to working with a post-Saddam Iraqi government , and they virtually invite the country 's military establishment to stage a coup in order to avert a devastating strike on their troops and equipment . On Capitol Hill , sentiment is strong for ousting Saddam  --  finishing the job some say was left undone in the gulf war . Sen. Richard Lugar , an Indiana Republican and a veteran member of the Foreign Relations Committee , advocates sending in ground troops to force Saddam from power . <p> Yet the gulf states and U.S. officials also worry that if the Iraqi state splinters , mass refugee flows , terrorism , and instability could spill across the region . No Arab state would be able to provide a sufficient military counter to Iran across the gulf . That prospect preoccupies top U.S. military officers : " A Saddam in place and contained is better than promoting something that causes Iraq to explode or implode , fragmenting the pieces , and causing turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who commands U.S. forces in the gulf , warned last month . The fact is , sustained bombing campaigns are not a finely calibrated political tool : They can not be counted on to destroy a regime without plunging the country into chaos . <p> The next dilemma is how to preserve future weapons inspections of Iraq . The administration and U.S. allies fear that an attack will spell the end of the probes by the U.N . Special Commission , or UNSCOM , for chemical and biological weapons and missiles , and by the International Atomic Energy Agency for Saddam 's nuclear weapons program . Those inspections , it is said , have discovered and destroyed more weapons than have all of the bombs dropped and missiles fired during and after the gulf war . Clinton officials still acknowledge that inspections remain the best assurance against an Iraqi " breakout "  --  the deployment of weapons of mass destruction . <p> Hide and seek . Inside the administration , Saddam 's October 31 halt to all inspections made that debate seem academic . Saddam has eviscerated the inspections , officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , had to be abandoned . " UNSCOM is not functioning now , " says one senior aide to Albright . " If it can not operate , we have to look elsewhere . " <p> Yet few officials see an attack eliminating Saddam 's unconventional weapons . " By the time we start bombing Iraq , " said Scott Ritter , the former chief UNSCOM inspector who resigned in protest , " we may be in danger of pumping million-dollar cruise missiles into empty buildings . " U.S. military planners agree . Many of the Iraqi facilities that house Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction are moved regularly ; some can be housed in spaces as small as a garage . Says a senior military official : " Nobody expects this to solve the problem . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Clear choice .

Auster ; Kevin Whitelaw <p> Section : U.S. News Radio war Baiting Baghdad over the airwaves <p> PRAGUE  --  Deep within a glass-and-steel building on this city 's busiest boulevard , in a makeshift office divided by a blue curtain , the United States is trying another way to get rid of Saddam Hussein : a radio station . <p> Ever since the 1991 gulf war , all efforts to oust Saddam have sooner or later run into the fundamental problem that there is no viable opposition movement inside Iraq . Whatever the outcome of the current confrontation , that reality will remain . <p> At this point , the most concrete effort by U.S. officials to create an opposition is Radio Free Iraq  --  staffed by a handful of exiles and funded by $5 million from U.S. taxpayers . Congress also has authorized $97 million of surplus military equipment and training for the " Iraqi opposition , " but the Clinton administration has no immediate plans to provide that equipment to anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible to receive it . <p> Radio Free Iraq began beaming Arabic-language news toward Saddam 's impoverished minions on October 30 . Housed in the Prague headquarters of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty , it is supposed to do for Iraq what RFE/RL did for Eastern Europe in the cold war : gradually undermine totalitarian rule with the most potent weapon of all , information . <p> Staffers say the news is presented as objectively as possible , without any hostile propaganda . But Baghdad nevertheless has reacted angrily . Iraq 's foreign minister called the station " poisonous " and warned of " huge losses "  --  apparently in trade  --  for the Czechs . Radio Free Iraq 's chief editor , Kamran Al-Karadaghi , a Kurd who left Iraq in 1980 , says that several of the radio announcers use pseudonyms for security reasons . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Jeremy Druker <p>
