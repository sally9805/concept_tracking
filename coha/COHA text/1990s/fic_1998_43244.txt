The note was slipped to me on Wednesday , July 20th , at two minutes before three . I know the exact time because I happened to be staring at my watch , wondering if Dr. V. would be running late today , as she sometimes did , when the double doors burst open , and Peacock Throne walked out . I called her that because she had the darkly imperious ethnicity of an Iranian princess , and also , of course , because I did n't know her name . Sometimes she was crying when she came out , her mascara softly running , but today she seemed actually giggly , as though she and Dr. V. had been in there exchanging amusing stories about bad dates . Usually , Peacock Throne threw me a cursory smile when she left , the smile of a princess to a subject . But now she seemed to veer toward me as she walked through the narrow waiting area littered with old copies of Gourmet . I swung my knees to the side to let her pass , like someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let something tumble deliberately into my lap . I was shocked . In thirty seconds , Dr. V. would be poking her head out of the double doors , having done her little preparations for the next patient , which apparently consisted of ripping off a single sheet of Viva paper towel and placing it over the headrest of her couch . I 've never understood whether that piece of paper towel was supposed to be for my protection , or for the protection of her couch , a beige Jennifer Convertible covered with a thicket of woolly nubs . <p> Peacock Throne just kept walking , leaving the waiting room and heading outside , the front door clicking quietly shut behind her . In my lap was her carefully folded , slightly used-looking note . I opened it . The note read : " If you are interested in discussing Dr. V. with her other patients , please meet outside this building on Monday , August ist at 12:00 . Also , kindly pass this on to the next patient after your session . Whatever you do , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And please do n't break the chain . Thanks ! ! ! " <p> The three exclamation marks after the last word gave me pause ; they seemed such a young and girlish garnish to this forceful letter . Had Peacock Throne written this herself ? Or had it been lobbed into her lap by Lighting Booth , the heavy , melancholy man in the rotating collection of Broadway show bomber jackets ( Carousel had recently replaced Miss Saigon ) . Or maybe it had been thrust at her by Learner 's Permit , the kinetic teenaged boy with the blurry bad skin and beautiful eyes , whose therapy probably consisted of tentative pontifications on whether death really is final . Before I had a chance to sift through the possibilities , the double doors opened again , and Dr. V 's head appeared : the quick smile , the scarf , the big blue-framed glasses . I dropped the note into the pocket of my shoulder bag , then walked into her office , where I carelessly tossed the bag over a chair , as always , and headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were lying there choking on a sourball , she would not say a word until I managed to emit some guttural , farm-animal sound first . Dr. V. seemed so passive that at times I felt as though we were two polite strangers occupying different corners of an otherwise deserted subway car , looking everywhere but at each other . On July 20th I kept quiet about the note , and instead began the session by dredging up a minor dream from a few nights earlier , which I had almost forgotten . I would often leave a single dream in reserve , one which I was n't sure I even wanted to mention , so that if there was another subject lurking which seemed too mortifying to discuss , I could always sigh and say , " So I had this interesting dream . . " The spiral pad and pen would dutifully appear ; I could hear them , the paper asserting itself as it crackled on its spool of wire , the Bic pen clicking into readiness . Dr. V. loved dreams , especially dreams about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were there , " like Dorothy after she returned from Oz and lay in her bed surrounded by familiar Kansan faces , Dr. V. instantly perked up . <p> " Oh ? " she would say . " Tell me . " <p> On this particular day , I launched easily into the dream , something about my father secretly being the real person responsible for the Salk vaccine . Soon I stopped thinking about the note entirely , and when the hour was up , I was reluctant to go . What if I did n't get up ? What if I just lay there , ignoring her suggestive rustling ? Usually , when I stood up and looked at Dr. V. at the very end , I would be reminded of how shocking were the things I had said to her only moments earlier . " The mole on my great-uncle 's shoulder made me sick ! " I had cried one day . I told her everything , while she remained a cipher to me . I could not even imagine her going home at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the door would lead only into a dark , empty stockroom , not a home . She would never tell me anything about herself , of course : whether she had a husband , or children . She would n't even say where she went every August when she closed up shop . Did she stay in the city like I did , sitting in front of the air conditioner blast , eating take-out kung-pao chicken and doing the Jumble in the newspaper ? Or did she migrate up to Wellfleet with her husband and their two or three children , the family car packed with the belongings of the family V. ? <p> On my way out of the office on July 2oth , I slung my bag over my shoulder and closed the double doors behind me . There in the waiting room sat Game Show Host , his hair high and blown . I could not imagine what men like this discussed with their psychoanalysts . He was so carelessly handsome ; he seemed the kind of man who would do better committing himself to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people and take place in the conference rooms of midtown hotels . But here he was , under the quiet , fairly traditional care of Dr. V. , just like me . I tossed him the note , while gazing into his clear and startled eyes . <p> " Hey , wait , " he said . " What is this ? " But I was out the door . I said goodbye to Dr. V. on the last Thursday of July . I admitted that I would miss her during August . I said that no doubt I would call her answering machine once or twice during the month , just to hear her recorded voice , and then hang up without a word . The session ended now , and I stood awkwardly . She actually smileda slight wince , as though she 'd located a tiny chink of glass in a mouthful of food-and then she reached out to shake my hand . " Goodbye , Susan , " Dr. V. said , and then our hands were touching , warm palm to warm palm . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her ; this happened every August . Last summer when we shook hands , I noticed that she had a widow 's peak , which I have , too . My whole life , this widow 's peak has been a problem , causing my hair to remain jaggedly parted . I wanted to say , " Look , look ! " and pull a hank of hair back from my forehead in solidarity , but I did n't . I glanced at her face now , trying to notice some new detail for future use , but all I could see were the things I already knew . She was a middle-aged woman in a scarf and big-framed blue eyeglasses , not unlike the women in my mother 's book discussion group . I used to see them whenever the group was held at my parents ' house ; they arrived with their copies of Middlemarch or Anais Nin 's Diaries , the text of the book feverishly marked up . " Symbolism ? " they would write in the white space , or " How true ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day of August , of what we did and said , or of the damage we caused . But it was as though , once we started this , we had to finish it one way or another , like an analysis itself . Shortly before twelve o'clock , I stood alone under the awning on East 83rd Street . I assumed that we would all meet here and then go to a restaurant . I pictured the bunch of us crowded into a big wooden booth , nervous and jangly as strangers at a singles ' brunch . I looked over at the lineup of brass professional nameplates nailed to the outside of the building , the catalogue of psychiatrists , psychologists , and the occasional , proud M.S.W. who were housed in the first-floor offices inside . Now , though , the offices were silent , and even the white noise machines had been unplugged . Every August , it was as though a virus had wiped out the entire New York population of people in the helping professions . <p> Peacock Throne arrived , and to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Next came Learner 's Permit , in his hightops and backpack . Then I noticed that , a few feet away , Lighting Booth was approaching , humming a song I knew from Fiorello . By ten past twelve , there were eight of us in front of the building , several whom I recognized from occasional schedule changes over the years , a few whom I did not . There was a man who I was pretty sure played a young father in a Bell Atlantic commercial , and an ethereal woman carrying a battered edition of Proust-Volume II , I glumly noticed . I myself had never been able to get beyond Volume I. I imagined that this woman and Dr. V. spent their sessions in gentle contemplation of literature , not to mention language itself . She was probably a graduate student who read late into the night , subsisting on bowls of ramen noodles . A couple of patients were still missing , and we gave them a few more minutes ' leeway until finally , a dark , compact man carrying a strongbox arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall we what ? " Lighting Booth asked . <p> " Well , " said the man , " this whole thing was my idea , and I thought we 'd just , you know , go in . " He turned and walked into the vestibule . We followed him , watching as he squatted down , snapping open his box and removing a few small , serious tools . " I 'm a locksmith , " he explained . " This should n't be very difficult . " Within three minutes he had worked open the door to the lobby , then the door to Dr. V 's anteroom . We others followed sheepishly behind , stunned at the illegality of this , but undeniably thrilled . The locksmith popped the lock on Dr. V 's double doors , and we filed in without saying a word . The room felt as warm and close as the stage set for a production of No Exit . At first , no one could bear to turn on a light . Then Proust Woman began to laugh nervously , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halogen lamp , which flooded the office with that familiar yellow light . <p> The room was orderly , with very few changes . The paper towel on the end of the couch was gone , and so was the plant that usually sat on the windowsill . Learner 's Permit went over to the couch and flopped down hard . " Feels good to sit , " he said . " I 'm sick of lying down . The ceiling is boring . " <p> " Did you ever notice , " said Lighting Booth , " the way the cracks in the ceiling above the couch form the shape of a baker 's hat ? " <p> " Not really , " said Peacock Throne . " And can we just get started ? " <p> Then she actually sat herself down in Dr. V 's chair . We all just stared . It was one thing to break into the office of your psychoanalyst , and another thing entirely to sit in her chair . She swiveled the chair from side to side ; it made a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard many times before during sessions . " First of all , " said Peacock Throne , taking over , " does anyone know where Dr. V. goes in August ? I mean , really know . Not just a guess . " How would we possibly know ? " asked Laura Ashley . " It 's not as though she tells us anything . " She paused , then added suspiciously , " Why , does she tell you things ? " <p> " No , " said Peacock Throne . " Not a word . But my brother-inlaw found out that his analyst spends August in a house in Dutchess County , because his friends , who also have a house up there , were talking about this couple who have a house down the road , a psychoanalyst and his wife , and they mentioned that the husband 's name was Nathan , and my brother-in-law started shouting , Not Nathan Kantor ! Not Nathan Kantor ! ' And the friends said yes , their country neighbor was Nathan Kantor the psychoanalyst . And they told my brother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he has raspberry shrubs growing all over his property , but he never lets the neighbors ' children pick raspberries . " <p> Then Proust Woman said in a small , trembling voice , " My theory is that Dr. V. goes to France every August . She and I have discussed certain aspects of French life before , and she 's always struck me as very sensitive on the subject . I asked her if perhaps she and her family rented a home in Provence , and she did n't disabuse me of the fact . " <p> " Fact ? " said Lighting Booth . " It 's not a fact . It 's a fantasy , that 's all . " <p> But I thought to myself : I can see her in France . Tooling around the countryside with her family in a rented Citroen , wearing her big blue eyeglasses , using her rusty Seven Sisters French language skills . It made sense to me that even as we all sat here in her office , she and her husband and children were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at JFK . <p> Suddenly I noticed that the locksmith was starting to go through the drawers of Dr. V 's desk . He took out a few papers , and we all grew excited , but they merely turned out to be fliers for the annual " Fling into Spring ' Blowout " at the Karen Horney Institute . Then he reached deeper inside a drawer and fished out an opened pack of Trident , followed by a pen that read PROZAC on the side . The objects were passed around for inspection , and Proust Woman discreetly pocketed the pen , but these little details brought us no closer to knowing who our analyst was . <p> Just as I began to think that this whole adventure was misbegotten , Laura Ashley suddenly said , " Did you ever notice the way Dr. V. really starts to pay attention only when you talk about her ? I mean , " she continued , " I can be telling a story about the day my father walked out on us , and Dr. V. does n't say a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how angry you make me feel sometimes ; she always says , Oh ? Tell me . " <p> Several of us laughed bitterly . Oh , that " Oh ? Tell me . " We knew it well . <p> " The thing is , " said the locksmith , " I have no idea whether my analysis is helping me , but I 'm very sexually attracted to her , so I enjoy coming here . She has a wonderful body , under all those big blousy things she wears , and those scarves . You know , " he continued , " many people in my profession undergo psychoanalysis in their lifetimes . It 's quite common . " <p> " Really ? " I said . " I did n't know that . " <p> " Oh yes , " he said . " Two of the other guys at Keys Plus have been in treatment for years . Something about the image of the key in the lock fills us with dread and intense longing . I suppose it 's like being small boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate womanly secrets . It 's all very interesting , of course , and I 've been coming here forever , but you know something ? Lately I 've been thinking that I could find better ways to spend my ninety dollars . " <p> A shocked silence fell over the room . Ninety dollars ! I paid a hundred dollars a session ; when I first came for a consultation , Dr. V. had said that her usual fee was one hundred twenty-five dollars , but that she would lower it to meet the needs of my budget . I had felt special , chosen , tapped for Skull and Bones . Yet now , many years later , I was learning that all along she had been charging the locksmith less . Maybe if I had pushed her a little more , I could have talked her down . But how could I have known that you could treat a degree-holding psychoanalyst like a Florentine street-merchant ? <p> We went around the room , telling one another how much we paid . Most people were squarely in the ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the highest fee ; that honor went to Learner 's Permit , whose parents , he admitted , paid their son 's analyst one hundred and fifty dollars a session . " What can I say ? " Learner 's Permit said , shrugging lightly . " My dad 's a big fat art dealer . " The only person who had n't revealed the amount she paid was Proust Woman . She looked very nervous now , as though hoping that everyone would forget about her . But I had to know . <p> " You did n't tell us how much she charges you , " I said mildly . <p> " That 's kind of personal , " she answered . <p> " Come on , " said Lighting Booth . " Nothing 's personal here . We do n't even know one another 's names . " <p> The woman uneasily plucked at the spine of Volume II . " Well , actually , " she said in an apologetic whisper , " she charges me fifteen dollars a session . " <p> We all gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encircling her in rage , yanking the Proust from her small , pale hands . " Fifteen dollars ! " said Lighting Booth . " How could she do that to me ? I give her all my money . I ca n't even afford cable ! " " While she waltzes off to France for the month of August " added the young father . " Or should I say , off to France for the month of Aout . Oo-la-la , renting a villa , sitting and eating les brioches . " <p> " And you know what else , " said Learner 's Permit . " I really do n't like her eyeglasses . They make her look so average . " <p> " Exactly , " said Laura Ashley . " So undistinguished . Why should we give all our money to such a person ? And her answering machine , can you believe that message ? " <p> Lighting Booth sprang up and went to the answering machine , which sat on its own low table . He pressed a button , turned up the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overenunciating into the room . We all laughed , agreeing that this was the lamest message ever recorded . When the beep sounded , the locksmith announced that he was going to erase her message and replace it with a new one . We listened , impressed and appalled , as he rewound the short tape and recorded a new message in its place . " Hul-lo , " he said in his husky baritone , leaning close to the built-in microphone . " This-is-Dr. -V . " In the background , despite our disapproval , we all began to hoot and cheer . " I can not come to the phone right now , " he continued , " because I am spending August in the South of France , on your money ! Having a great time without you , far away from your disgusting little homoerotic fantasies- " <p> " - and your boring dreams , " added Peacock Throne . " - and , " I found myself piping up , " the oil from your hair on my paper towel ! " The others screamed with laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the answering machine , talking into it and howling , when the door opened . We turned , and there in the doorway stood Dr. V. We were silent . Behind her stood Game Show Host , bobbing up to peer over her shoulder . " You see ? " he was saying with triumph . " I was n't making it up . " <p> For a long time she stood and looked at us . " What am I going to do with you ? " she asked us sadly . I ca n't quite remember what else she said , so shocking was it to hear her voice . I only know it had something to do with the bonds of trust that we had broken . Proust Woman suddenly interrupted , asking her why she was n't on her way to France , and Dr. V. just looked puzzled . " France ? " she said . " What gave you that idea ? " No one could answer . " So , did you find out what you wanted ? " Dr. V. asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say that we had found out anything . We stared down at our hands , or at the rug , and we apologized over and over . Finally she said that we could go , and that we would sort this all out individually in September , but I knew that that would not happen , at least not for me . I could not imagine that my analysis would be strong enough to withstand the shame I now felt as she looked us over . We said our goodbyes to Dr. V. , then we left her office and walked back out into the sunlight , like the stunned survivors of a massive wreck . <p> My new therapist does not need to be referred to by only one initial . " This is n't Kafka , " she said cheerfully . Her name is Linda Manzini , Ph.D. , and her office is located downtown in the West Village , in a brownstone that also happens to be her home . The edges of her personal life are occasionally revealed to me by accident . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance in the waiting room , and once a package lay in the front hall when I arrived , a delivery from Williams-Sonoma that bore the shape and heft of a cheese board . I always notice the details , but it 's really out of habit , not curiosity . <p> Mostly , I am relieved not to be in analysis with Dr. V. anymore , but sometimes I do miss the mystery of it all , the pointed silences , the sheets of paper towel , the strange , inarticulate understanding that lived between us . I now sit upright , once a week , in the palm of a big leather chair that has a slight fall of cat hair on it , and when I speak , Linda Manzini always meets my gaze . She is a motherly and sympathetic woman who wears caftans year-round . I know exactly who she is , and I have to say I am disappointed . <p>
