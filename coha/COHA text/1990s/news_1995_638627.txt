<p> Aurora will support best reuse of Fitzsimons after closing <p> I was pleased to see The Post 's continuing interest and support for making sure that the upcoming closure of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is conducted in ways that meet the needs of the traditional customer and that the facility remains in use and serves as an economic driver for the City of Aurora and the rest of the metropolitan area . <p> We have been actively working to assure that needs of all Fitzsimons users are addressed as the base is closed and reuse begins . <p> While we applaud your vision and spirit in suggesting the specific reuse alternative addressed in the July 13 editorial , there are a number of problems with it . These problems are so serious that they call the proposal 's viability into question . <p> First , to our knowledge there is no interest on the part of the Department of Defense in maintaining a presence at Fitzsimons . The BRAC recommendation was for closure , and the recommendation by the commission is , regrettably , to provide retiree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attempt to legislate a joint facility , the most likely result would be strong DOD opposition to the effort . <p> Second , it is not obvious that the Veterans Administration would have the funding to implement the plan . There is no funding in this year 's VA budget for new construction and precious little for major renovation . Funds available to the VA are likely to shrink as Congress attempts to balance the budget over the next six years . <p> Moreover , it is not clear whether Defense or the VA has done any planning whatsoever regarding this proposal . We know there has been a generalized expression of interest , but that is it . <p> I applaud your interest in finding the best solution and pledge to you that the City of Aurora will continue to lead a coalition effort to find the best , most feasible reuse solution for Fitzsimons . <p> PAUL E. TAUER , Mayor <p> Aurora <p> Need for affirmative action still exists <p> The American Friends Service Committee applauds President Clinton 's recommendations to reaffirm the principles of affirmative-action programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination which has continued against many people in this country , and because the entire society benefits from it . <p> Affirmative action is not a matter of giving special rights , but of breaking historic and continuing patterns of exclusion , ensuring equal opportunity for all people against discrimination in jobs , housing , health care , education and economic livelihood . <p> Until we widen the pool of candidates and let people from all segments compete for jobs , how can we say there is equal opportunity ? For example , the mean income of African-American men graduating from college is still a third less than that for white men . <p> The American Friends Service Committee has a long history of standing with people who are facing discrimination based on race , gender , sexual orientation , disability , religion , national origin or legal status . Our belief in the value of each person calls us to work in the struggle for greater justice for all , and to call for greater inclusiveness in all our communities and institutions . <p> GREGORY JOHNSON <p> American Friends Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into films <p> Rene Rodriguez 's article in the July 16 Post , " Films get their kicks from smoking habit , " aptly described the role of smoking as a prop in the movies , where " cigarettes are almost as prevalent as Demi Moore 's cleavage . " Rodriguez may be unaware that tobacco companies frequently pay to have their products featured in films . One of the best examples of this was in Superman II , which received underwriting from a tobacco company . Not surprisingly , one of Superman 's fight scenes is staged in front of a tobacco billboard . And Lois Lane , who never before smoked cigarettes in the comics , TV or movies , suddenly is depicted as a smoker . <p> Yes , the smoking habit continues to be ubiquitous in Hollywood movies , and tobacco advertisers wait in the wings with fat checks in hand to ensure that it stays that way . <p> JOHN A. WOLFE <p> Fort Collins <p> Your July 20 , edition carried a small story on page 21A about the increase in teenage smoking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer believing smoking is harmful or socially objectionable . " He also said " movies and TV programs portray smoking as more common and socially acceptable than in fact it is in the general population . " <p> The same edition had two articles and one sidebar in the Living section , one headlined " Smokin ' , " showing the smoking of cigars as trendy , glitzy and cultish . It is none of those . Any use of tobacco is highly addictive and deadly . Secondary smoke is offensive to nonsmokers and endangers their health . The articles showed cigar smoking in a very positive light , including pictures of happy , smiling movie stars . There was virtually no mention of the dangers involved . <p> With articles such as those found in the Living section , is it little wonder that teenagers believe smoking is more common and socially acceptable than it really is ? <p> JOHN E. PRICE <p> Littleton <p> Since the tobacco industry is prohibited from advertising in newspapers , I am at a loss to understand why The Denver Post printed what in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 13-year-old son who reads the paper with me each morning , and your story showing the glamorous side of cigar smoking was most unwelcome . <p> The tobacco industry has been lambasted for marketing cigarettes to youngsters , and here you are showing how cool Bruce Willis , Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson are with their cigars . <p> When will The Post publish a story of equal prominence explaining the negative side of cigar smoking with the following information : <p> 1 . Cigars contain nicotine which has been determined by the U.S. government to be an addictive drug . <p> 2 . Cigars can cause lip , throat and lung cancer . <p> 3 . Cigar smoke is much more dangerous than cigarette smoke if inhaled . <p> 4 . Cigars produce a much larger volume of second-hand smoke and are thus more dangerous ( and offensive ) to nonsmokers . <p> H. PIERSON <p> Denver <p> Thanks for ' Atomic Legacy ' series <p> Thank you for providing your readers with the series of remarkable articles and photographs entitled " Atomic Legacy : Post Cold War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern science and of the profound moral questions which these capabilities have raised for all humanity and especially for the United States as a nation . <p> WILLIAM DAVIDSON <p> Loveland <p> People can disagree <p> on the death penalty <p> I was amused at criminal defense attorney Phil Cherner 's letter ( " Death penalty is morally bankrupt " ) attacking capital punishment . Unlike most people , liberal extremists such as Phil fail to even acknowledge that reasonable and moral people can disagree about the death penalty . <p> Phil utilizes the hackneyed claim that killing a killer makes the government no better than those who are executed . Does that illogic extend to the serious crime of kidnapping ? <p> If your child or loved one is forcibly abducted and taken to a small room which she is not allowed to leave , how do you feel the government should respond ? The rational and moral response is to punish the proven perpetrator by forcibly removing him from society and taking him to a small room which he is not allowed to leave . <p> Does jailing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps Phil Cherner , who so frequently writes letters to the editor criticizing the utility of prisons , would answer yes , but most reasonable and moral people can see the distinction . <p> CRAIG SILVERMAN , Chief Deputy DA <p> Denver <p> Monument rite today <p> honors service in Korea <p> A monument will be dedicated today as a memorial to those who served in the Korean War from 1950-1953 . On July 24 The Denver Post finally had an article on the subject . No wonder it 's called the forgotten war . I 'll attend the ceremony , but only because my son sent a clipping from the Spokane paper . <p> To the majority of Americans , the TV series M.A.S.H . typifies the Korean War . Great comedy between dashes to the helipad and serious moments in the OR . It was n't real to those under 60 years of age . It was , however , a bloody three-year conflict in which 34,000 American service men and women lost their lives . We were unprepared , overconfident and politically confused . The lesson we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited ground conflict against a force backed by China , on their continent , was doomed from the start . We fought the same war in Vietnam , but are still talking about it . <p> We who survived , took the Korean War G.I. Bill , raised families and helped rebuild this country should take time to remember those 34,000 who never had a chance . <p> CHARLES C. SEEBER <p> Littleton
