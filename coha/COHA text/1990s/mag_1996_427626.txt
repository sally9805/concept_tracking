The founder and namesake of the Dave Matthews Band took the long , painful approach to musical success . So why is he so happy ? i. mr. a psychs up <p> In a dusty parking lot 100 yards behind the stage of DeVore Stadium , where 10,000 fans await his appearance , Dave Matthews begins his pre-performance ritual . The location is Southwestern College in Chula Vista , Calif. , another stop of the 1996 H.O.R.D.E . Festival , and the leader of the Dave Matthews Band is cranked . Beloved by fans for his achingly lyrical songs ( and dismissed by some critics as a bland , Hootie Nation jammer ) , Matthews offstage is a guy neither his defenders , nor his detractors , would recognize . g " I feel good ! " Matthews yelps in a full-throated James Brown . He leaps and shimmies , tossing his gangly , goofy , loose-jointed frame down the narrow aisle of his tour bus . From here , Matthews glides into an imitation of fellow H.O.R.D.E . act Lenny Kravitz , thrashing at a low-slung air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a gyrating stripper , then he 's the ninja master from his favorite martial-arts movie , chopping the air , bellowing : " You have hurt my students . I will kick you hard in the intestines ! " <p> Alex Stultz , the 23-year-old merchandising manager , barely glances up from his magazine . After nearly four years with the Dave Matthews Band , he 's seen this more times than he can count . He 's heard Matthews ' rapid-fire repertoire of voices , impersonations , accents ; he 's seen Matthews ' dead-on imitations of Germans , crazy professors , Brazilian exiles , stuffy Brits ; and he 's heard Matthews ' endless stream of toilet jokes  --  a raft of anal-fixated japes that from a less boyishly enthusiastic 29-year-old might be offensive and weird . But coming from Matthews ( whose younger sister , Jane , affectionately calls him Mr. Anus ) , the unceasing allusions to his bowels  --  and the manic , high-speed , free-associative monologues  --  all come off as more funny than weird . So much so that it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Jim Carrey-like comic . Indeed , six years after Matthews began to supplement his full-time bartender job with musical gigs , his mother is still making backup plans for him . " If this rock &; roll thing does n't work out for David , " she says , " he could become a comedic actor . " <p> That wo n't be necessary . With sales around 5 million ( and counting ) for his three records , Remember Two Things , Under the Table and Dreaming , and the recently released Crash , Dave Matthews ' musical career is working out just fine  --  far better , in fact , than anyone had reason to expect , given the improbabilities of just about everything touching Dave Matthews and his band . <p> Five years ago , when the rest of the music world moshed to shredding grunge bands , Matthews was leading a virtually acoustic outfit : Carter Beauford on drums , Leroi Moore on sax , Stefan Lessard on bass and Boyd Tinsley on violin . Accomplished players all , they blended their disparate influences  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic , lilting folk music that reflected Matthews ' formative years in South Africa . The band 's sound bore greater affinities to ' 60s hippie bands like Fairport Convention than such grunge role models as the Stooges , Black Sabbath and the Sex Pistols . The spirit of Matthews ' songs , too , could not have been further from that of his rage-ridden grunge confreres . Good vibes radiate from the titles : " The Best of What 's Around , " " One Sweet World , " " Lover Lay Down , " " I 'll Back You Up . " But Matthews ' lyrics , sung in his wafting , Sting-like croon , are more likely to limn bittersweet emotions . In the song " Tripping Billies , " which has become a virtual anthem for his fans , the singer entreats : " Eat , drink and be merry/For tomorrow we die . " <p> Music critics , for the most part , hate it . But audiences have embraced the band with a fervor that the group 's multiplatinum sales only hint at . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever-changing set lists , making band-sanctioned bootlegs that are traded with fellow Daveheads via the Internet , the group 's fan base  --  mostly well-scrubbed college kids and tie-dyed latter-day hippies  --  have appointed DMB ( along with Phish and Blues Traveler ) as torchbearers for the Grateful Dead . It 's a legacy the Dave Matthews Band is living up to , thanks to the strength of its live show , which it has honed during five years of relentless touring . <p> Back on the bus , Matthews dispatches the last of his phantom ninja attackers . Minutes later , he is facing the DeVore Stadium crowd with his band mates . Their entrance is met with a cheer that hits the stage like a gale-force wind . " Hey , how y'all doin ' ? " Matthews asks , as if he 's just happened upon a few friends . " We 're the Dave Matthews Band , and we 're from somewhere in Virginia . " <p> With that , Matthews begins the staccato guitar figure that opens the song " Drive in Drive Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbroken skein of entwined sax and fiddle lines anchored by Lessard 's bass , Beauford 's rock-steady drumming and Matthews ' agile riffing . It 's a tight but improvisational sound that seems to draw this crowd of 10,000 into an intimate circle , in which Matthews is the center , the " party guy , " as he puts it later , the entertainer . Only by listening to the words of " Drive in Drive Out " would you guess at the singer 's ambivalence . " I hear more than I like to , " he says with a growl , " so I boil my head in a sense of humor/I laugh at what I can not change . . . . When all that I want is so badly to be/By myself again . " ii . the racial bonus <p> Dave Matthews ' speaking voice is , like his music , a weave of accents and influences , a laconic Southern drawl one moment , a precise British inflection the next . Matthews ' image is equally tough to pigeonhole . His oversize T-shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shells , fossils ) shout hippie ; his close-cropped dark hair is too short to justify the description " brush cut , " too long for a skinhead ' do . <p> Matthews ' protean image , it turns out , fits him well . He was born Jan. 9 , 1967 , in a suburb north of Johannesburg , South Africa , where both sides of the Matthews family have deep roots . When David was 2 years old , his family moved to the New York suburb of Yorktown Heights , where Matthews ' father , a physicist , worked for IBM . For one year in 1974 , the family lived in Cambridge , England , before returning to Yorktown Heights . <p> Matthews , who much of the time brims with the potential for a joke or a laugh , grows quieter when he speaks about his father . Matthews calls him , with obvious pride , " one of the granddaddies of the superconductor , " and describes a loving and close-knit family that included , besides Jane , an older sister , Anne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disrupted early in Matthews ' life when his father , John , developed lung cancer . " We figure he might have got the disease from the radioactive material he handled , " Matthews speculates . His father died when Matthews was 10 . <p> This was not the only tragedy to visit the Matthews family . Shortly before the release of Dave 's 1994 breakthrough album , Under the Table and Dreaming , Anne died , the victim of a tragic incident that also claimed her husband . Matthews asks that the details of their deaths not be published for the sake of her two children , ages 6 and 9 , whom he and Jane are raising . Although Matthews has never spoken publicly about the tragedy , he dedicated Under the Table to Anne and included in the CD 's jewel box a photograph of himself and his nephew . <p> Matthews says that these experiences have inevitably colored his songs . " I think a lot of the reason my choruses conclude , ' Make the best of it '  --  or maybe , ' Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hit our family were also an inspiration for me , " he says . " They make me want to live now , desperately  --  and to try to affect things positively . " <p> Having returned to Johannesburg with his mother and siblings after his father 's death ( " For family connections and support , " he says ) , Matthews was an indifferent high school student whose antics earned him the lash at his British-modeled private school . His time was devoted not to schoolwork but to noodling on the guitar , drawing and listening to music . <p> " It was n't like the rest of us , however , " says Jane about her brother 's passion for music . " He listened very purposefully . He knew every word to every single Beatles album . " He also fell in love with the indigenous African pop music and was especially drawn to the emphasis on drums . " I 'm very into percussion , " he says . " That 's the way songwriting started for me : imitating different folk music that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , and trying to move with the guitar rather than just strumming and singing a vocal line over it . " Matthews prefers to play unplugged : " Electric guitar is not as much a percussive instrument as an acoustic is . I feel at home with an acoustic because it 's hollow ; it 's got a drum quality . " <p> To avoid South Africa 's compulsory military service , Matthews returned alone to the United States , in January 1986 . Although he had become a U.S. citizen at 13 , he still considers South Africa his spiritual home . He says that his mother , a painter and a former architect , helped to shape his views on South Africa 's segregationist apartheid regime . " She was involved in the Quaker church , " Matthews says , " and was extremely aware of the political scene and very involved . It was an integrated church and often a place for a political voice . . . to protest the government . We were brought up , very aggressively , that bigotry and racism are evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his later trips to the country , Matthews himself became active in protesting the crumbling apartheid regime : " I would go back and stay with friends , and political conversations were going on because they were all in college now . My friends would go to marches , and I would join them . It was a really interesting , vibrant time . The theater and music we 'd go to see was always a voice of opposition . Going back there now and seeing the striving for freedom is such an amazing thing . " <p> Matthews says that his later decision to enlist three black men for his band reflects , at least obliquely , his experience as a white person growing up in segregated South Africa . " I approached Carter , Leroi and Boyd because they were the most fantastic musicians I 'd ever seen , " Matthews says . " But if the way our band looks onstage  --  two white guys and three blacks guys all playing together  --  sends out some kind of positive racial message , that 's a bonus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matthews lived in New York . He took a job as a temporary clerk at the IBM research center where his late father had worked . Matthews did not attend college and says that his mother and sisters were not pressuring him to firm up a plan in life . " We did n't really know what he was going to do , " says Jane with a chuckle , " but I always assumed it would be something fabulous . " <p> His extended family was not so understanding . He recalls how his South African uncles used to hassle him . Matthews slips into an Afrikaner accent : " ' David , you 've got to have a foundation . ' " Matthews laughs . " It got to the point where they 'd ask me what I was going to do with my life , " he says , " and I 'd just say , ' Nothing . ' That 'd really piss ' em off . " iii . home-grown <p> Like such musical breeding grounds as Athens , Ga. , and Seattle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for the nurturing of bands . A college town of some 50,000 , it 's a laid-back city of green lawns and tree-lined avenues  --  a place well-stocked with music-hungry students and replete with hole-in-the-wall bars and restaurants where pickup bands spring up with all the fecundity of the local kudzu . <p> It was to this town that Matthews migrated , in 1986 , along with his family . " Before I was born , my dad taught in Charlottesville , " Matthews says , " which comes around to why we ended up there . " <p> Though he bridles a little at the description , Matthews , who then sported a long ponytail , does n't deny that he was something of a hippie . " I 'd draw and wander , draw and wander , " he says . " That 's kinda all I wanted to do , was walk around . For me that was my college , just making enough money to get from one place to the next place , going back to South Africa , working temporary jobs . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy but little else ) did n't take . Vague plans to attend art school also evaporated . Meanwhile , he indulged his hearty appetite for transcendental and consciousness-raising substances . " A little dabbling in everything , " he says with a grin . " Smoke a little something with somebody ; drink a little something with someone else ; whatever 's going around . Whoever 's there . " <p> In 1987 , he took a job as a bartender at a local Charlottesville bar called Miller 's . The step hardly seemed one that would put him on the path to multiplatinum pop stardom . But Miller 's was a hangout for local musicians who played gigs on the small stage at the front of the room . Among them were local music teacher and hornman John D'Earth , who later put out a solo record and now plays in Bruce Hornsby 's band ; guitar virtuoso Tim Reynolds , whom Matthews later recruited to play second guitar on his band 's albums ; and a fine saxophone player named Leroi Moore  --  a saturnine , Buddha-shaped presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We used to get into these weird conversations about South Africa , " says Moore . " We 'd mostly get drunk and talk about how evil apartheid was . I had no idea that Dave was a musician . Not the slightest idea . He was just the bartender . " <p> " My friends in South Africa knew I played guitar because I played all the time ; that 's all I did , " Matthews says . " But no one in Charlottesville really knew . " Gradually , he let his secret be known among his new friends at Miller 's : " I sat in with Tim Reynolds a few times , and I played with John D'Earth . I started to open up . " One day , Matthews let everyone know that he 'd also been writing songs . " It 's weird , " he says . " After a trip to South Africa , I cut off all my hair . Somehow that gave me the confidence to show people my stuff . " <p> Miller 's regular Ross Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was the guy who pushed me , " Matthews says . " He was the one who 'd say : ' No , do n't smoke that pot . Finish that verse . Finish that song . ' He was my musical mentor , the guy who said , ' You should do this . ' " <p> When Matthews decided in late 1990 to put together a band , he approached his old customer Moore . Having joined the school band as a sax player in the seventh grade , Moore was by now one of the most respected and sought-after saxmen in Charlottesville . " He said he wanted to do this project , " Moore recalls . " He wanted to make this demo . I said , ' Sure , I 'm down with that . ' " <p> At the same time , Matthews enlisted drummer Carter Beauford . Moore and Beauford had grown up as good friends on the same street in a middle-class black neighborhood in Charlottesville . In their post-college years , they played together in bands . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheerful man of 39 whose barrel chest and meaty arms suggest the athleticism and power of his drumming . By 1990 , Beauford was playing in several bands  --  fusion , jazz , a swing orchestra  --  as well as appearing on Black Entertainment Television 's BET on Jazz channel . <p> For a bass player , Matthews turned to D'Earth , who recommended one of his music students , Stefan Lessard , a 16-year-old prodigy and the only other white musician in the band besides Matthews . Raised in a cash-strapped hippie family that spent its early years migrating between California and Rhode Island , Lessard settled near Charlottesville when his parents became followers of Swami Satchidananda , who established an ashram nearby . Lessard lived out of a trailer from the age of 5 until he was 10 . " A bunch of hippie potheads , " Lessard says with genuine affection . " These are my childhood memories . " <p> Violinist Boyd Tinsley , recruited just weeks after the band formed , grew up right around the corner from Moore and Beauford , and had studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the locally famous " hippie frat house " Sigma Nu . " Lot of brothers were doing Bob Dylan covers , " says Tinsley . " Neil Young covers , Grateful Dead . " <p> The Dave Matthews Band 's first gigs were at a minuscule restaurant , Eastern Standard , down the street from Miller 's . Within weeks , crowds were lined up outside the door , listening . The band then landed two weekly slots at Trax , a local nightclub , and Flood Zone , a club in nearby Richmond , Va . Now the audiences were more than 900 people a night  --  every night . The clubs ' owner , Coran Capshaw , took immediate notice . He signed on as the band 's manager and told it he wanted it to take a " different route " to success . A bearish man with a wiry head of graying hair , Capshaw is the veteran of some 400 Dead shows . He detected in DMB something of the Dead 's free spirit , but , more important , he saw an outpouring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band on similar principles to the Dead 's : through a grass-roots following built on the strength of Dave Matthews Band 's live show . Record labels came sniffing , but Capshaw turned them down . Instead , he booked the band at every paying gig in the Southeast . " I doubt ICM , William Morris or CAA would put them in a frat house , " Capshaw says . " I did , and I put them in resorts and at beach clubs . . . . Lots of people have an ego problem with that . " <p> Not Matthews and the boys . He calls the band 's frat days " good work . " But it was also an education for Matthews in American college life . " Boy , was that the educated class ! " he laughs , then imitates the sound of someone vomiting . " The hurling , puking , tertiary education that every good American should have . " <p> Soon , the band was playing 200 nights a year , " three or four hours a night , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It often crossed paths with a band on a similar mission , Hootie and the Blowfish . " We have real respect for each other , " Matthews says , " because we played on the same circuit . Our music is clearly different from theirs . But they are such nice guys , and they know the score . These are not guys who say to you , ' We are badass players . ' " <p> The Dave Matthews Band are badass players , and word spread fast . " People were bootlegging our shows and sending tapes to their friends , " Tinsley says . " People in Colorado knew about us before DMB toured there . We 'd never been to Alabama before . We 'd go to this place , and cars would be lined up down the road , and there 'd be all these people going to this big club . We 'd be sitting in our red van saying , ' Oh , my God ! ' " <p> By late 1993 , Capshaw thought the band had built a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The 1993 independent CD Remember Two Things had just been released and would go on to sell 366,000 copies . ) The band 's major-label debut , Under the Table , was released in 1994 and went to No. 11 in the Billboard 200 , driven by the hit " What Would You Say . " The band deliberately did n't release a video of the song to MTV until more than two months after the record 's release . " I wanted people to be a fan of the band , " Capshaw says , " not the single . " The band 's label , RCA , went along with the unorthodox strategy . " We could have sold hundreds of thousands more copies of Under the Table if we 'd wanted to go for the fast buck , " says Bruce Flohr , the label 's West Coast A &R; man . " But the idea was to bring along the core base of fans , then add new ones . " <p> The strategy seems to have worked . The band 's sophomore RCA disc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Billboard  --  robbed of No. 1 by fewer than 5,000 units by their old buddies Hootie and the Blowfish . But Crash ran afoul of some critics , who dissed the album as boomer-friendly rock . Matthews laughs off the critical backlash . " I do n't really read reviews that much , " he claims . " Really , really , really crappy ones  --  I like to read those . A guy from New York Newsday gave us the best insult . He said our success was somewhere between America 's tolerance for Barney and France 's love for Jerry Lewis . I was like , ' At least we 're up there . ' I mean , that was right when Barney was burnin ' , just tearing it up ; and Jerry was still as big as he always will be in France . " Meanwhile , the Dave Matthews Band sold out all 35,000 tickets for its two-night stand in October at New York 's Madison Square Garden ; the first show sold out in three hours . iv . the wild dogs <p> Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlottesville to begin a rare three-week vacation . He will be flying off to St. Maarten in three days with his girlfriend of four years , Ashley . <p> He gets off the plane at 10:30 p.m. and an hour later is at his old stomping grounds , Miller 's , where he joins his sister Jane and a few friends to watch Tim Reynolds play his regular Monday solo gig . Back in the room where Matthews tended bar for years , it seems , for a short while , as if he never left ; then strangers begin to recognize him . He is approached by a string of well-wishers  --  including a dark-haired , black-clad girl who has been sitting along the wall , scribbling in a notebook . She slips him a piece of paper that includes a quote from Kierkegaard , her phone number and the P.S. : " You need to see Trainspotting . . . . P.P.S. : With me . " Later , out on the sidewalk , where he 's weaving a bit from a string of tequila shots and some herbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , then says to Jane : " She definitely seems like an intense person with a strong mind . " Then he adds with a laugh : " And a giant , illuminated sign over her head saying : Do n't Come Anywhere Near This Girl . Danger ! " With that , he wobbles off into the night to Jane 's house , which is nearby ; his final destination : her guest bed . <p> Last year , in an effort to stake out his own retreat , Matthews moved into a house in the secluded foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains . The day after he arrives home , Matthews drives out there to check on the place . The house , a hermit 's retreat , is at the end of a winding , narrow dirt road and perched on the side of a waterfall . A converted flour mill built in 1750 , it comes with 65 acres and a price tag of $500,000 . He strolls around , inspecting the grounds and making plans . " I 've got the design in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lots of light , high ceilings , so that friends of mine , people who need a place , and artists , can come and live and just have a place that they can do their art and do n't have to worry about money . " <p> But Matthews is a long way from starting his artists ' colony . During the past six months , he 's spent perhaps two nights here . Packing boxes sit , still full , in the mill 's vast , loftlike interior , and the place has a lonely aura . The few personal touches are a set of dusty museum display boxes containing the African cicadas that Matthews collects as a reminder of his homeland . The singer 's CD collection , which has not yet been removed from its packing box , offers a catalog of Matthews ' influences : Pink Floyd , Peter Gabriel , the Beatles , U2 , INXS , Traffic  --  as well as a cache of South African and other international musicians : Vusi Mahlasela , Ali Farka Toure , Baaba Maal , Abdullah Ibrahim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique sofa that Jane recently bought for the place . He picks up a guitar that leans against the wall . Alone , far from the stage and the cheers of his fans , Matthews coaxes from his melodies a melancholy that he says was often the impulse behind the songs . Between playing soulful , slowed-down versions of his hits , he talks about the price he has paid for musical success . " Sometimes I get a little afraid that being on the road  --  and in this separated position  --  that I will lose sight of some of the things that were inspirational to me when I was bartending and meeting people , " he says . Matthews also says he 's beginning to feel the pressure to keep coming up with hits . He plays the riff to " What Would You Say " and looks up . " See , I look at that and think , ' Where did I come up with that lick ? ' I 've also been plagued by the song " Recently . " I want to write another lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . I wish I could figure it out . When I get one , I think ' Phew , I got another one I like . ' " <p> Matthews then plays the chords to " #41 , " a song from Crash that reflects the new album 's darker mood . " Remember , " he sings in a voice abraded by too many cigarettes , too many days on the road , " when I used to play for all the loneliness that nobody notices now . " <p> Still fingering the guitar , Matthews reveals that this song was written around the time that he was undergoing a messy split over money with his mentor , Ross Hoffman . " I was thinking about where I come from , and why I wrote songs and what was my inspiration , " Matthews says . " And how I was now in this situation where those things that I 'd done , I so loved , had now suddenly become a source of incredible pain for me . Suddenly there 's all this money and people pulling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs come out . The innocence of just wanting to make music was kinda overshadowed by the dark things that come along with money and success . " Then Matthews , catching himself , smiles  --  and like one of his songs , he turns the melancholic moment , searching for the upside . " So it 's a song about looking back , " he says , " but at the same time , a song that 's still adamantly looking forward and going , ' But I 'm still going to carry on , regardless .
