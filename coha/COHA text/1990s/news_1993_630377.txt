<p> A few years back , a ubiquitous TV commercial tried to persuade baby boomers to turn from beer to beaujolais with the phrase , " You get older and your tastes change . " <p> That may be true of wine , but it 's even truer of rock ' n ' roll . <p> The common complaint of former rock fans as they move through their 30s and into their 40s is that it gets harder and harder to stay current with popular music . And there seem to be fewer reasons to bother . <p> " People ca n't necessarily escape through pop music like they used to in their youth , " says North Side resident Chris Scott . " Priorities change . Suddenly , instead of hearing rock as rebellion and independence and freedom , other things like mortgages and children move in to take that place . " <p> Scott , 33 , was the Midwest college promotions manager for A &M; Records in the early ' 80s , and he played a role in breaking bands such as R.E.M. , Oingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's an associate editor at Crain 's Chicago Business , a weekly trade magazine . <p> Scott admits that pop music is n't as big a part of his life as it once was . But unlike many of his peers in the business world , he makes an effort to discover new sounds . <p> " I watch , unfortunately , way too much MTV , " he says , laughing . " And the Video Jukebox channel , which is a lot more interesting and progressive and not nearly as censored as MTV . <p> " Anyone who falls into the trap of saying there 's nothing as good now as there was then is fooling themselves . It 's a very shortsighted notion . " <p> But it 's a common tendency for people to wax nostalgic about the music of their youth . " Rock today just is n't as good as it was when I was growing up in the ( fill in the blank : ' 50s , ' 60s , ' 70s ) " is the usual refrain . <p> A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eras reveals that 98 percent of the releases turned out to be junk . The rest endured , and that 's as true of the music released in 1963 as 1993 . <p> " Someone pointed out to me that if you read all the novels written in England in the 19th century , it would take your whole life and 98 percent would be absolute - - - - . But what we have ( in rock ) is a medium that gives us all the - - - - with the good stuff and we have n't had time to sift through , " says Larry Grossberg , who 's taught a course on rock music at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for the past 15 years . <p> " Actually , I think there 's been more great music since 1976 or ' 77 then there ever was before , " Grossberg says . " What 's more , the important music out there today is doing a better job giving voice to what it feels like to be alive in America today than ever before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " <p> " There is always a lot of bad stuff that comes out , and you 've just got to sift through for the good stuff , " says Johnny Mars , who 's been spinning records at Chicago 's WXRT-FM ( 93.1 ) since he was 22 . <p> " After a certain period of time , you become inundated with going to shows , seeing the concert , waiting for the encore , " he says . " Sometimes I find that I ca n't wait until they get done . There 's a lot of stuff that does n't speak to me , whereas before it was easy to relate to what was going on . <p> " But when you hear something that completely blows your mind and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up , that 's when you say , ' This is why I 'm doing this . ' It just renews your faith that somebody 's still doing stuff to get that kick . " <p> Yet many boomers would rather listen to the music they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they listen at all . Classic-rock radio , rehashed " unplugged " albums and geezer reunion tours are the musical equivalent of comfort food : familiar and reassuring , but ultimately insubstantial . <p> Although Lollapalooza ' 93 was popular , the Grateful Dead had the biggest-grossing tour of the season again last summer . And the top-rated rock station in Chicago is classic-rock WCKG-FM ( 105.9 ) . <p> Arbitron ratings show that the majority of ' CKG listeners are men ages 25 to 54 . But the familiar diet of " Truckin ' " and " Stairway to Heaven " also draws a significant number of teens . <p> " I wish there was some way to convince baby boomers to stop listening to oldies and start listening to new stuff , " Grossberg says . " But what I ca n't figure out is why the kids would want to listen to oldies . " <p> Mike Pinera believes it 's a healthy process of discovery . Once the guitarist with Iron Butterfly , Pinera now leads a group called ( without irony ) the Classic Rock All-Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry Corbetta and former Rare Earth drummer Peter Rivera . <p> The All-Stars perform hits by its players ' old bands , including songs like " I 'm a Man , " " Ride , Captain , Ride " and " In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida . " A recent plum gig saw the group performing for 14,000 at the Fargo Dome in North Dakota on a bill that included REO Speedwagon , Badfinger , Molly Hatchet and Cheap Trick . <p> " Parents stick their albums in the garage , and when the kids are 9 or 10 , they start exploring through the house , and they go , ' Wow ! ' " Pinera says . " And other kids discover the Doors and Led Zeppelin , and soon word gets out that these were the guys who pioneered the field , paving the way for Guns N ' Roses and everything else . " <p> Not just nostalgia <p> Pinera maintains that the Classic Rock All-Stars are n't a nostalgia group because the band leaves plenty of room for spontaneous jamming . That keeps things fresh , while the many 12- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original emotions of the songs . <p> " The same thing Nirvana and N.W.A and vintage Iron Butterfly and the Doors have in common is the motivation for writing the composition in the first place , " Pinera says . " There 's a serious , deep-seated theory that the effect comes when the song is charged with emotion when it 's written . They 've even tracked this down to plants , man . <p> " They 've attached sensors to plants , and they 'll play like classical music or Ravi Shankar 's music , and the plants grow new blossoms . They 're finding that if you really charge something with emotion and depth from your innermost being , that translates onto the record or CD . " <p> The secret life of plants aside , a more realistic explanation for the young teens listening to Iron Butterfly is that their parents consider the music " safe " because they grew up with it . They 're more than a little frightened of current , unfamiliar sounds . <p> " Rock 's rebellion in its mainstream forms was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Grossberg says . " Increasingly , good new music is going further . It 's really angry , and that 's much more problematic for baby boomers . <p> " As a result , we get all these rock fans sounding like their parents attacking rap . All this stuff that was said in the ' 50s and ' 60s to us , now we 're doing to our kids . And that 's how we get Tipper Gore , " who advocates censorship of rock lyrics . <p> Emotional rescue <p> But while the language and specific styles may change , the emotions expressed in the Rolling Stones ' " Satisfaction " are n't much different than those in Nirvana 's " Smells Like Teen Spirit . " Similarly , Sly Stone 's " There 's a Riot Going On " has more than a little in common with Public Enemy 's " It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back . " <p> Chances are people who deny that link never understood the music in the first place . <p> " Some people will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creep ' is such a big deal , " Scott says . " Those are the types who it wo n't make a difference one way or another whether they try to stay current . Because they 're probably the ones who did n't get it way back when , either . " @x POLITICO.COM OPENED A rich vein of controversy in March when it reported that " President Obama does n't go anywhere without his teleprompter .... No other president has used one so consistently and at so many events , large and small . " Indeed , I have learned Obama sometimes brings a teleprompter to the Indian Treaty Room at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and uses it to speak to as few as 15 people . Obama 's reliance on the device has led some to assert it has become a crutch he ca n't throw away-much like the cigarettes it 's been rumored the chief executive still sneaks puffs on . " After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches , reports surfaced that he was training to wean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no luck , " noted Politico.com . Indeed , several reporters took notice of the new teleprompter that Obama unveiled at his late March news conference . Fox News opened its post-conference analysis by showing a picture of a 52-inch teleprompter that had been positioned in the back of the room , replacing the usual two screens flanking the podium . The change had clearly been made to make sure the TV cameras covering the event did n't pick up a view of the device . Moderate columnist Ruben Navarrette acknowledged that " the popular narrative from conservatives-that Obama stumbles when he is off the teleprompter-is becoming more believable . " But do conservatives agree on the significance of the fact that a man known as a gifted orator often uses a teleprompter ? There are sharp divergences of opinion . Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution is acidic : As it turns out , Obama has been such a bumbling incompetent that he probably could n't handle a trip through a Wendy 's drive-in window without a teleprompter telling him what to order . " Michael Gerson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle : " With a teleprompter , Obama can be ambitiously eloquent , without it , he tends to be soberly professional . A teleprompter speech represents the elevation of writing in politics . And good writing has an authenticity of its own . " Tucker Carlson , the former MSNBC host , took issue with Obama critics such as Glenn Beck who worry that the teleprompter should cause Americans to worry " about who 's writing every word for this man . " " I am completely for the teleprompter , " he told a New York authence this month . " I know it 's frustrating for conservatives that there 's this narrative that Obama is stunningly eloquent when he 's often not . But you ca n't change a narrative once it 's set in people 's minds . They will even reject direct evidence to the contrary . " Deroy Murdock , a syndicated columnist for Scripps Howard , also gives Obama a pass : " God bless him and his teleprompter . Ronald Reagan used one to great effect to give great speeches , so who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to the Obama teleprompter issue by dismissing it and using it as an excuse for more Bush bashing . CNN 's Rick Sanchez introduced a segment on the issue by claiming " the far right this week has been saying that President Obama is too stupid to talk without a script . " He then played David Letterman 's skit titled " Teleprompter vs . No Teleprompter , " which pitted an excerpt from Obama 's first speech to Congress against a clip from an informal town hall meeting given by former President Bush . It was no contest , although it would have been fairer also to compare an Obama speech with one of his own gaffe-prone speeches when he was winging it on the campaign trail . All that said , Obama sometimes gets a bum rap for mistakes related to his constant traveling companion . At a March St. Patrick 's Day event , he was standing next to Irish prime minister Brian Cowen when the foreign leader started giving President Obama 's remarks off the teleprompter . Mr. Obama then stepped in and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Obama .... " But he was ad-libbing to break the tension , not reading mindlessly from the screen . Yet even Obama 's joke served to underline an impression that he 's become overly scripted and too dependent on the device . THE JOKE HAS GONE SO FAR that a satirical blog ( **36;1558;TOOLONG ) has been started in which the president 's teleprompter dishes up presidential gossip and snarky comments about White House message development . In mid-March , the blog noted press reports that Obama 's aides were trying again to wean the president off the teleprompter crutch . " Are they insane ? With this rabid press corps constantly looking to pin Him down for every ... detail about obscure legislation like the TARP funding ? Or the economic stimulus bill ? All that kind of detail ca n't be fit on little note cards . " Indeed , the teleprompter blog has confirmed reports in The American Spectator online that the White House is now " looking into how to hide video screens in podiums the president uses . " Such placement of screens would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical data or quick points to be made by Obama in answering press questions . That would create a " wow " factor- an impression of competence and skill that would be unwarranted- akin to when President Kennedy was leaked in advance some of the questions that would be posed to him at White House news conferences , which reinforced the liberal narrative that he was a charming master of all subjects . Using teleprompters for speeches is fine . What worries some Americans and should worry reporters is if use of such devices goes further and allows a president to pretend he is something he is not . As former Bush administration speechwriter Peter Roff notes , a presidential news conference is a test of sorts- a test of presidential skill under pressure . Having top aides transmit behind-the-scenes updates to be used during a seemingly spontaneous event would be akin to a student writing the answers to a test on a shirt cuff . After all , it was n't so long ago that left-wing bloggers fell into a frenzied lather complaining that the bulge in President Bush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him electronic assistance in answering questions . Barack Obama is n't the first president to use a teleprompter , and such a device can clarify his thinking and make it easier for the American people to understand his policies . But it 's also appropriate for the media to note just how much more he is using it than did his predecessors , and that there is a line beyond which a " Great Communicator " becomes a " Wizard of Oz " - a puffed-up figure who is much less impressive once people look behind the curtain .
