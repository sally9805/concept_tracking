<p> LISTENING to Philip M. Condit and Harry C. Stonecipher talk about the difficulties facing the Boeing Company , the global aerospace powerhouse and national icon they jointly run , oddly brings to mind the feminist battle cry of the 1980 's : They just do n't get it . <p> After an awful year of monumental production foul-ups , $4 billion in unexpected accounting charges and lots of talk about illusive recovery plans , the news from Boeing only seems to get worse . Earlier this month , the company stunned investors and its 232,000 employees , more than 40 percent of whom reside here in the Puget Sound area , with the announcement that it would cut as many as 48,000 jobs by 2001  --  and still make only a negligible profit . <p> The news from the nation 's single largest exporter rippled across the country like the storms that pour rain on this city and then head east . President Clinton weighed in with his concerns about the company 's health . And on Wall Street , shareholders  --  who had been led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anger , even disgust . Boeing stock closed at $33.125 a share on Friday after selling for as much as $56.25 in April . <p> " This is one of the great American industrial franchises of the 20th century , " said John Hayes , an analyst at Independence Investment Associates , an institutional money manager that sold its stake of several million Boeing shares last year . " For the business to be in this kind of disarray is unfathomable . These guys have been doing this a long time . They should know how to build planes at a profit . " <p> Yet in their first interview since announcing the latest cuts , Mr. Condit , the chairman and chief executive , and Mr. Stonecipher , the president and chief operating officer , spoke last week as if Boeing had no choice but to make the decisions that have laid it low  --  to sell hundreds of airplanes at cut-rate prices in 1995 and 1996 and then to nearly triple production rates , from 18 airplanes a month to the current record rate of 51 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last year , " said Mr. Stonecipher , the former chief executive of McDonnell Douglas , who joined Boeing after it acquired McDonnell last year for $16 billion , creating a national monopoly in large passenger jets and the world 's biggest military contractor and aerospace company , with more than $56 billion in revenues expected this year . <p> " The systems were overloaded to the point where it does n't matter who was in charge , " he said . " You could have worked it a lot of different ways ; the result would have been the same . " <p> MR . CONDIT 'S credibility seems especially weak , because he has had to revise so many of his public positions in the last year . Yet while contrite , he still has trouble , even in hindsight , viewing the company 's actions as a colossal blunder . " I think we were very close to making it , " he said of the ill-fated ramp-up in production . " So it is n't , gosh , you can look back and say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boeing 's 13-member board is set to meet tomorrow in the wood-paneled boardroom where Mr. Condit and Mr. Stonecipher were talking . And for the first time in anyone 's memory , as The Seattle Times pointed out in an editorial last Sunday , the ouster of a Boeing chief executive is being openly discussed by employees and on Wall Street . <p> " If I was on the board , I would be taking a hard look at whether to keep him , " said Bill Whitlow , an analyst at Safeco Asset Management in Seattle and manager of a fund that holds 67,500 Boeing shares . <p> Seven of the outside board members declined to comment ; three did not respond to telephone messages and one other board member could not be reached . While Mr. Condit acknowledged that he was in the hot seat , he said that he was working harder than ever and that he did n't think a change at the top made sense . <p> " I think we are better together than either one of us would be alone , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could not imagine a better partner . " <p> Still , if Mr. Condit 's days are numbered , Mr. Stonecipher , 62 , may be positioned to cap his long career as Boeing 's next chairman . That idea rankles many employees of the old Boeing  --  " heritage Boeing , " in the company 's post-merger parlance  --  because after years of bruising competition they , not McDonnell Douglas , had prevailed in the marketplace . <p> " I have heard internal comments that , ' Hey , we won , but now they are running the show , ' " Mr. Whitlow said . <p> Boeing loyalists especially resent what they see as the heavy hand of Mr. Stonecipher , a blunt talker who became popular on Wall Street first by turning around the Sundstrand Corporation , a maker of aerospace components , and then by sharply improving McDonnell 's financial performance before selling that company to Boeing . <p> As Boeing 's problems worsened in the last year , Mr. Stonecipher 's power appears to have grown . He , rather than Mr. Condit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a number of Boeing executives with whom Mr. Stonecipher is said to have clashed , including the longtime chief financial officer and the head of the commercial airplane division . <p> Mr. Stonecipher , who had a large stake in McDonnell Douglas , is now one of Boeing 's largest shareholders ; so is John F. McDonnell , the son of one of McDonnell 's founders , who like Mr. Stonecipher is on the Boeing board . Mr. Condit , like other board members who came from the old Boeing , owns relatively little stock . <p> Investors and analysts credit Mr. Stonecipher with sharpening Boeing 's focus on shareholder value . Boeing 's decisions to increase greatly its communication with Wall Street , disclose earnings targets , announce large job cuts and buy back up to 15 percent of its stock all echo Mr. Stonecipher 's previous stints at Sundstrand and McDonnell . ( The company 's new candor , of course , has contributed to its problems , as promises and predictions have failed to materialize . But Mr. Condit says he still thinks that Boeing should keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stonecipher is also seen on Wall Street as a strong executive who holds his charges accountable , while Mr. Condit is widely viewed as a talented engineer who is out of his element running the country 's 11th-largest industrial company . <p> In the interview on Wednesday , Mr. Condit and Mr. Stonecipher dismissed talk about differences between them as idle gossip . Mr. Condit said that they leaned on each other and often swapped roles , but that Mr. Stonecipher 's job was to focus more on day-to-day operations while he concentrated on longer-term strategy . <p> Few people privy to the inner workings of Boeing 's executive suite would comment on relations between the men . Current and former Boeing executives are reluctant to criticize them . <p> The two men could not be more different . Mr. Stonecipher is tough-talking , quick-tempered and unsentimental . He was raised modestly in the coal-mining regions of eastern Tennessee and worked his way up through General Electric for 27 years , rising to become head of its jet engine business before spending seven years at Sundstrand and three at McDonnell Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 40 years . <p> Mr. Condit grew up comfortably as an only child in San Francisco , where his father was a chemist for Standard Oil . He joined Boeing in 1965 after getting a master 's degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton and was quickly identified as a golden boy destined for greater things within the company . In addition to doing engineering work on a variety of airplanes , Mr. Condit had stints in sales and marketing . He was named president of Boeing in 1992 , rising to chief executive in 1996 and to chairman last year . He is currently going through his third divorce . <p> WHILE Mr. Stonecipher is feared , Mr. Condit , who is known for his people skills , is genuinely liked . " I 'm a little more aggressive than Phil , " Mr. Stonecipher told a group of potential investors in New York last year . " I 'm more likely to shoot you and then ask you your name . Phil is likely to ask you your name and then shoot you . " <p> Mr. Condit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he led the team that designed the 777 , Boeing 's newest and most modern jetliner . In the course of that project , he promoted an uncharacteristic degree of teamwork that he has since tried to spread to the entire company . <p> A self-described lifelong learner , Mr. Condit received his Ph.D . last year from the Science University of Tokyo . He is also not afraid to help Boeing executives  --  not the most introspective group  --  get in touch with their feelings . Four years ago , he hired David J. Whyte , a poet and motivational speaker , to run workshops with top managers . In one meeting at Mr. Condit 's home , the executives were asked to write down negative stories about Boeing and toss them into a bonfire so that only positive , inspirational stories would remain . <p> These days , executives would likely be tossing Boeing 's last five quarterly earnings reports into the blaze . <p> The company 's difficulties building commercial jets have prevented it from capitalizing on one of the biggest sales booms ever . Though Boeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European consortium  --  and is building more jets than ever , it says it will make hardly any money for the next two years from selling them . Analysts say that by the time Boeing fixes its problems , demand will have dried up . <p> In acquiring McDonnell Douglas , Mr. Condit wanted his rival 's large military operations . Along with the space business of Rockwell International , which Boeing bought for $3.2 billion in 1996 , they were supposed to help Boeing balance the ups and downs of the notoriously cyclical passenger airplane market . But even with all those new businesses , Boeing expects to earn only $1 billion this year , a meager 1.8 percent return on sales . <p> In hindsight , it seems obvious that Boeing 's commercial airplane business was headed for trouble , given what the company was trying to do . Two years ago , when demand for new planes began to pick up after a drought in the mid-90 's , Boeing made a bold bid to gain market share by offering steep discounts . Executives believed that plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II and are still largely paper-based  --  would allow the company to lower the unit cost of each jet by 25 percent , so that it would make a profit even at the low prices . <p> As orders poured in , Boeing was forced to increase production to 40 planes a month , from 18 , in a year and a half . Rather than help , the efforts to consolidate 400 separate computer systems , track millions of parts and digitize thousands of drawings added to the rising confusion . Parts shortages developed , and work fell behind schedule as thousands of new workers  --  hired to replace older , skilled laborers who took early retirement during the previous down cycle  --  could not handle the load . <p> At the same time , Boeing was trying to introduce several new models , each of which required certification by regulators in Washington and Europe , adding to the delays . In addition , many of its new orders were from new customers , which meant tens of thousands of hours of engineering work to customize the planes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boeing 's assembly lines around Seattle had seized up . The company said it would halt production of its 747 and 737 jets for a month to catch its breath . Along with costly changes on the new 737 , that resulted in a stunning $2.6 billion in accounting charges . <p> Investors were angry ; Boeing had been insisting for months that reports of production difficulties were exaggerated . Over the next year , as the airplane division struggled to recover , a pattern developed . Executives led by Mr. Condit would try to put the best face on the situation . But just when it seemed things were turning around , the company would drop another bombshell . <p> A low point came in July , when Boeing released its second-quarter earnings and , for the first time , offered earnings guidance to Wall Street analysts . While most analysts were estimating that Boeing would earn $1.64 a share this year and $3.24 a share in 1999  --  down from as high as $5 before the production difficulties arose  --  Mr. Condit said the company expected to make $1.01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 . <p> Boeing 's share price plunged , and analysts were irate . The next day , when Mr. Condit met in Boston with institutional investors and analysts , one analyst all but called him a liar . At a similar session in New York the next day , another analyst implied that Mr. Condit was deliberately trying to drive down the price of the stock to buy it on the cheap . <p> Shaken , Mr. Condit , returned to Seattle and told colleagues he never wanted to be put in such a position again . <p> But his credibility has continued to deteriorate . In the spring , Mr. Condit strongly defended Ronald B. Woodard , the head of the commercial airplane division , when many people were calling for his head . Five months later , he ousted Mr. Woodard , who had been in line to become Boeing 's president . Insiders now say that Mr. Condit 's mistake was not firing Mr. Woodard sooner . <p> Boyd E. Givan , Boeing 's chief financial officer for 32 years , was also forced to resign after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot the messenger , " said Dean Thornton , a retired Boeing executive . Mr. Givan will be replaced by Deborah C. Hopkins , former chief financial officer for General Motors Europe , who starts work tomorrow . <p> Mr. Condit said that if he finds fault with himself , it is in underestimating the challenge of transforming Boeing from a company of the cold war era , which valued engineering performance above all , to one that also values financial performance . <p> Now , he said , " we have unhooked ourselves from market share intentionally and said what we are about is running a profitable company . " <p> Mr. Condit and Mr. Stonecipher said that the bad news this month was unavoidable , because the economic downturn in Asia had forced the company to cut back its production in 2000 far more than it had thought . <p> The explanation is puzzling : For more than a year , the company 's assessment had been much less pessimistic than those of outsiders ; now , when some experts are beginning to say that conditions in Asia are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . <p> " I think most of the world is really in denial about what 's going on in Asia , " Mr. Stonecipher said . <p> What really alarmed investors about Boeing 's recent disclosures was the company 's acknowledgment that margins on its commercial airplanes would be even lower in 2000 than in 1999 . Boeing attributed the deterioration to expectations that it will sell more of its new models , which command lower margins than older planes . But the announcement raised analysts ' concerns that it will take Boeing longer than anticipated to make its assembly lines more efficient . <p> Already , Alan Mulally , the new head of the commercial airplane division , has delayed the production modernization program ; instead , the company will try to deliver planes on time and avoid penalties . " We are probably the least efficient we have ever been making airplanes , " Mr. Mulally said in an interview last week . Thousands of extra workers are on the payroll simply to get planes out the door , he said . <p> With this month 's layoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , even as Boeing depends on them to help it out of a jam . " It 's a helluva Christmas present to give Boeing employees , " said Bill Johnson , president of the machinists union local that represents 39,000 Boeing workers . <p> The union , which struck Boeing for 69 days in 1995 , is gearing up for negotiations next August , and it believes it has Boeing over a barrel . The company wants to introduce a new workweek to cut overtime and institute co-payments on health insurance . The union will have none of it . <p> " We are not going to be mean , " Mr. Johnson said . " We are just going to make sure we get the things we want . They can not afford a strike in September . I see them somewhat on the defensive already . " <p> Can Mr. Condit ride out the current storm ? On paper , the odds look to be in his favor . Only 4 of the 13 board members , including Mr. Stonecipher , came from McDonnell Douglas . Eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including such pillars of the Northwest as George Weyerhaeuser , the paper magnate , and Charles M. Pigott , the former chairman of a truck maker , Paccar Inc . <p> EVEN with Mr. Stonecipher in the executive suite , there is no clear succession plan . He would be popular with investors , but faces mandatory retirement in less than three years . The only other obvious candidate within Boeing is Mr. Mulally , 53 , who has his hands full turning around the jet business and is not yet considered seasoned enough to be chief executive . <p> Bringing a new leader into Boeing from outside would be a dramatic step for the proud company . But it could hasten changes that Mr. Condit and his predecessors have talked about implementing for the last decade , with little apparent progress . <p> " Boards really are n't very compassionate , " Mr. Stonecipher said . " The moment the board decides that somebody else can get this thing done for them , we will be out of here the next day . " <p> Is Boeing at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " he replied . <p> Chart : " Flying Through Turbulence " 1997 AUG. 4  --  Completes merger with McDonnell Douglas .
