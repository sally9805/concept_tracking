REDECORATING DOMBEY : THE POWER OF " A WOMAN 'S ANGER " VERSUS UPHOLSTERY IN . DOMBEY AND SON I find I am " used up " by the Exhibition . I do n't say " there 's nothing in it " - there 's too much . I have only been twice . So many thins bewildered me . I have a natural horror of sights , and the fusion of so many sights in one has not decreased it . I am not sure that I have seen anything but the Fountain - and perhaps the Amazon . <p> Charles Dickens , 11 July 1851 <p> Perhaps The Amazon , an imposing statue on display in the Great Exhibition of 1851 , reminded Dickens of his own amazons from the 1840s ( Plate 1 ) . Exploring the implication of his culture 's gender economy in its political economy , Dickens filled Dombey and Son ( 1846-8 ) with angry women whose dissatisfaction with an " earth made for Dombey and son to trade in " ranges from unremitting shyness to explosive anger . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriarch who violates the cultural imperative of separate spheres . We see Mr. Dombey 's failing most clearly in his daughter 's displacement : lost in London for the first time , Florence asks directions to the House of Dombey and Son in the City but never she is again lost in London . No home for Dombey and Daughter complements the house of business called Dombey and Son . Eventually both of Dombey 's houses are empty , and when all his women have left him , Alice Marwood , the angry prostitute , asks him , " Do you know nothing of a woman 's anger ? " ( 819 ) . As the masculine enterprise called " Dombey and Son " colonizes domestic space and destroys women 's lives , Dickens invokes the corrective power of female anger . The novel suggests that Dombey must make room in his house for Florence and come to terms with the feminine sphere of Victorian culture . <p> Although dickens disapproves of Dombey 's " Home-Department , " Dombey and Son neither restructures it nor restores women to their proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot is to persuade Dombey to relinquish the notion of home as his castle for faith in the angel in the house . Only that notion , however , is finally relinquished , and for no more than that faith . In the novel 's final chapters , Dombey 's stately house disappears , and Florence is displaced once again as Dombey himself becomes the center of a large , and largely male , community of feeling - a Crystal Palace of the spirit , built of sentiment and ideals . Licensed by Dombey 's chauvinism , the power of a woman 's anger is forgotten in the bright exhibition of Dombey 's sentimentality . Rather than deal directly with domestic politics , Dickens merely redecorates Dombey and thus escapes the problem of separate spheres . In the end , we can be sure that neither Dickens nor Dombey has really seen the amazon . <p> Describing the Great Exhibition of 1851 , Francis Klingender says that " in the noise and colour of the great fair , England for a time forgot the agonies and struggles of the hungry forties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " opened up a phantasmagoria into which people entered in order to be distracted , " but he also sees the middle-class home serving the same purpose : " the phantasmagorias of the domestic interior " also distract the bourgeois from social concerns . Though it enclosed raw materials and machinery under one roof , the Great Exhibition was a place of consumption rather than production . As a collection of commodities and art objects which both reflected and influenced the style of Victorian interior decoration , the Crystal Palace was a national ( with ) drawing room of sorts , a public refuge from history and politics . The Crystal Palace and middle-class houses were similarly and extravagantly furnished with ornate , heavily upholstered furniture and assorted sculptures ( such as The Amazon to which Dickens refers ) portraying women in a variety of guises . Though different in scale and construction , the cluttered Palace interior that so " bewildered " Dickens is similar in style to the cluttered Victorian parlors one sees in any illustrated history of interior decoration , similar as well to the interior of Dombey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrator H.K. Browne depicts it . <p> The Victorians ' prodigious use of upholstery originated as a defense against urban industrial experience , says Wolfgang Schivelbusch in The Railway Journey , where he connects trends in Victorian interior decoration with the development of the railroad . Schivelbusch says it is in the railway carriage " where upholstery originates as a central cultural-historical phenomenon of the nineteenth century . It starts out on the railway train as something merely functional : its initial purpose is simply to protect the human body from the mechanical shocks caused by machinery . " Eventually , however , upholstery " becomes an end unto itself " and spreads from the railway car into other spaces , primarily the home . With this development , " such upholstery is no longer functional when it appears in realms such as the living room , where there are no mechanical-industrial jolts or jerks to be counteracted . Thus the jolt to be softened is no longer physical but mental : the memory of the industrial origin of objects . " Therefore , the secondary function of upholstery is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible and thus forgettable " ( 123 ) . By softening and padding the domestic interior , the spread of upholstery helped the Victorians to forget such disturbing social realities as the industrial origin of domestic comforts . <p> Dickens uses " upholstery " as a metaphor for all the domestic comforts and ameliorative feminine qualities absent from the Dombey household . On being separated from his sister Florence and abandoned to the " cold , and bare , and strange " atmosphere of Dr. Blimber 's school , Little Paul Dombey feels " as if he had taken life unfurnished , and the upholsterer were never coming " ( 215 ) . " Upholstery , " however , has also long been used figuratively - and critically - to signify false appearances or insubstantial improvements ( the OED dates such usages back to the late 1500s ) . It is this usage that Schivelbusch begins to develop in his work on the industrialization of consciousness . He is inspired by a letter from Adorno to Benjamin : " all reification is a forgetting , " says Adorno , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being actually present in all their parts - the moment when some part of them has been forgotten " ( Schivelbusch 209 , n.2 ) . The domestic interior is not Schivelbusch 's primary subject , but I want to extend this notion of Upholstery-as-forgetting to read domestic and sexual politics in the nineteenth century and argue that narratives achieve closure " when some part of them has been forgotten . " In he case of Dombey and Son , this occurs when the angry female characters and their criticisms of patriarchal domesticity have been forgotten , obscured by sentimental " upholstery . " <p> Upholstery not only produces the illusion of a world separated into public and private spheres , but it also maintains the gender inequities inherent in the notion of separate masculine and feminine spheres . The Victorians celebrated domestic comfort as a legitimate manifestation of female power . At the center of the Victorian idea of home is a woman who unifies the household and embodies all the domestic virtues . Reinforcing comfortable notions of what constitutes femininity , the proper kind of woman upholsters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , textures the home with her comfortable personality , adds depth to it with her feminine qualities , and affirms its difference from the public world of the marketplace . Merely covering and padding hard surfaces is not quite enough to support an impression of escape from the marketplace into a realm of docile women ; it is necessary to decorate every available surface with idealized images of women and fill every empty space with knickknacks whose only function is ideological . Only the omnipresence and continuous production of images of the angel in the house , upholstery in its broadest sense , can maintain the illusion that the domestic is feminized and the female domesticated . The plenitude of Victorian upholstery - clearly seen in the fixtures and furnishings in the Great Exhibition - betrays an anxiety about the security of domestic space and the stability of gender identity ; it suggests that women do not live up to the domestic ideal but rather threaten to expose it as mere upholstery . It is this anxiety that structures Dombey and Son . <p> From its beginning , Dombey and son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redecoration . To point up Dombey 's proprietary attitude toward people ( especially women and children ) , Dickens focuses on the texture and quality of Dombey 's domestic life and provides highly rhetorical descriptions of Dombey 's private house . Since Dombey refuses to separate business and pleasure in the culturally sanctioned ways , his " wilderness of a home " is " old-fashioned and grim , " full of " dark heavy furniture , " and not so very different from " the wild wilderness of London " ( 395 , 76 , 759 ) . Dickens shudders his disapproval : " Ugh ! They were black , cold rooms " ( 109 ) . John Ruskin , too , would shudder at this patriarchal perversity , this obvious display of male prerogative . In " Of Queens ' Gardens " ( 1865 ) , Ruskin declares that " so far as the anxieties of the outer life penetrate into the home , and the inconsistently minded , unknown , unloved , or hostile society of the outer world is allowed by either husband or wife to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then only a part of that outer world which you have roofed over , and lighted fire in . " A part of the outer world roofed over is exactly Dombey 's idea of a home , and it puts him at odds with his culture . <p> It certainly puts him at odds with the women in the novel . Always on the wrong side of windows and doorways , languishing on thresholds , raging at boundaries , women can not survive in Dombey 's " Home-Department " ( 74 ) . As they die like Dombey 's first wife Fanny , get dismissed like his housemaid Susan Nipper , or run away from home like his daughter Florence and second wife Edith , they reproach Dombey . A portrait of embattled masculinity , Dombey is hypersensitive to sexual difference and affronted by the mere existence of women , not to mention the many roles they play in his life . For many of Dickens 's male readers , this portrait of a nervous father and defensive husband must have hit home . John Stuart Mill in " The Subjection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his male contemporaries found themselves : " The association of men with women in daily life is much closer and more compete than it ever was before . Men 's life is more domestic . " For instance , " Married people do not now live in different parts of the house and have totally different visiting lists , as in the reign of Louis XV " ( 232 ) . Nevertheless , Mill says , " The generality of the male sex can not yet tolerate the idea of living with an equal " ( 181 ) . <p> With the rise of idea of separate spheres ( that a feminized or upholstered domestic life supposedly balances and counteracts the masculine evils of public life ) , middle-class men faced not only a more domesticated life , but a more democratized domestic life . Mark Girouard , writing in The Victorian Country House , notices , however , that " one curious feature of Victorian houses is the increasingly large and sacrosanct male domain . " Although a " gentleman 's house " was ideally supposed to " protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " protecting womanliness can result in lead to male empowerment ( 16 ) . Therefore , billiard rooms , dining rooms , gun rooms , smoking rooms , and libraries exclusively for the use of men multiplied in opposition to women 's growing domestic authority ; a separate male sphere , inside the already separate female sphere , formed in defiance of " the idea of living with an equal . " As Girouard explains , " in the first half of the Victorian period , " the increase of masculine rooms in the house was " kept in check because of the religious bias of the time and the idealization of the family and the domestic virtues . The second half was increasingly secular in tone , and such rooms proliferated " ( 34 ) . The upholstery that was supposed to transform male behavior instead helped disguise male resistance to change and reproduce male rigidity . <p> Mr. Dombey 's use of domestic space prefigures this male resistance to increasingly close association with women . Treating women like pieces of " plate and furniture , " mere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dombey erases the evidence of their existence in his house ( 54 ) . He redefines the domestic sphere as his own " sacrosanct male domain , " and his house , which " had been inhabited for years by his father , " becomes even more a theater of male pride , a tribute to Dombey and Son 's power to exclude from its domain those who are neither Dombeys nor Sons ( 76 ) . Dickens begins Dombey and Son with a critique of this overt male appropriation of domestic space . The novel opens with Fanny Dombey 's death in childbirth - an obvious indication that something is rotten in Dombey 's Home-Department ( 74 ) . With such a beginning , Dickens provides the paradigm for women 's experience of domestic space Dombey-style and implies that it must be altered . <p> Dickens describes how , " when the funeral was over , " Dombey redecorated his house : " Mr. Dombey ordered the furniture to be covered up ... and the rooms to be ungarnished , saving such as he retained for himself on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating layers upon layers of textiles ( rugs , shawls , and cushions ) in the drawing room usually is an intelligible system of representation , calling attention to the inhabitants of the house . As Benjamin says , " Living means leaving traces . In the interior , these were stressed . Coverings and antimacassars , boxes and casings , were devises in abundance , in which the traces of everyday objects were moulded . The resident 's own traces were also moulded in the interior " ( Benjamin 169 ) . The purpose of Dombey 's redecorating scheme , however , is to erase all traces of his wife : thus , " Mysterious shapes were made of tables and chairs , heaped together in the middle of rooms , and covered over with great winding-sheets " ( 74 ) . Even Fanny 's portrait is covered over , though not entirely : " The dead and buried lady was awful in a picture-frame of ghastly bandages " ( 75 ) . Portraits hung in houses usually declare sentimental connections between the persons portrayed and the inhabitants , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's my last Duchess painted on the wall , " says Browning 's Duke . By upholstering Fanny 's portrait with " bandages , " Dombey retains his sense of possession while forgetting his dependence on her : the " bandages " exaggerate and confirm her absence . In Dombey 's house , upholstery does not feminize the interior , rather , it marks the denial of femininity , indicated that women are intentionally forgotten . <p> With Fanny forgotten , the life of the house , such as it is , centers on Dombey , who retreats into the suite of rooms which he " retained for himself " ( 75 ) . He rearranges the house and changes the functions of its rooms to " encourage his manliness " and create his own " sacrosanct male domain , " a house within the house : " The apartments which Mr. Dombey reserved for his own inhabiting , were attainable from the hall , and consisted of a sitting-room ; a library , which was in fact a dressing-room ... and a kind of conservatory or little glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 75-6 ) . The same dressing room which becomes a library later serves as a dining room when the christening party assembles there for its cold dinner . And after Little Paul 's death , Dombey is back " in his den " again , and the house contacts to the circumference of his self-regard : the result is an interior wilderness of neglect , featuring " hecatombs of furniture , still piled and covered up " since Fanny 's death ( 76,394 ) . <p> The space outside Dombey 's egocentrism , where Florence lives , is cold , dark , empty , wasted . Dombey refuses to participate in the collaboration of the sexes , prescribed by the separate sphered ideology . The Crystal Palace itself-the glass and iron building - was seen by some as just such a proper collaboration or joint venture , as a wedding of virtues coded feminine and masculine which was to promote national prosperity and avert domestic calamity : " We all know the hubbub that you , Mr. Paxton , have so magically hushed , " wrote Punch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... And then - Joseph Paxton came . And the Prince clapt his hands and said - Paxton , go forth into Hyde Park , take glass and iron , and - beauty wedding strength - produce the Industrial Hall of Nations ! ' " ( Fay 14 , my emphasis ) The Crystal Palace Dombey tries to build for himself is not even in theory such a collaboration ; all Dombey 's private and professional troubles follow from his misuse of the women at his deposal . As a domestic economist , Dombey 's error is wastefulness : he thinks of his daughter as " merely a piece of base coin that could n't be invested " ( 51 ) . " Girls are thrown away in this house , " says Susan Nipper , and all the females of Dombey 's houshold are literally marginalized , treated as if they do not , in fact , live within the house proper ( 79 ) . <p> Offering no relief from the " blank world " outside , Dombey 's home is continuous with it . Inside Dombey 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young child , lost and alone in the streets , " bewildered " and " perplexed " ( 132 ) . Attempting to be the domestic creature she feels she ought to be , Florence makes a " nightly pilgrimage " through the wasted house to Dombey 's apartments . And one night , " Stealing lightly down the stairs , " she finds his door slightly open . Though conflicting feelings " held her in irresolution on the staircase " for a moment , she finally goes in and speaks to Dombey , only to be rebuffed ( 327 ) . He tells her , " the whole house is yours above there ... You are its mistress now " ( 329 ) . Banishing her from his part of the house to solitude and empty space , he escorts her to the stairs , which always function Dombey 's house as a divide rather than a link between separate spaces , between his all and her nothing . <p> Years later , on the night Edith leaves Dombey , Dickens sets up another staircase scene that echoes Florence 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Florence " put on a shawl and bonnet , in a dream of running through the street until she found Edith ... But when she hurried out upon the staircase , and saw the frightened servants going up and down with lights , and whispering together , and falling away from her father as he passed down , she awoke to a sense of her own powerlessness ; and hiding in one of the great rooms that had been made gorgeous for this , felt as if her heart would burst with grief " ( 756-7 ) . Looking down at the scene opening beneath her , Florence watches the domestic traffic , and all the passion of her plan to " save " Edith changes course to explode inside her and drive her deeper into this " wilderness of a home . " Just as Dombey would not recognize Florence " if he was to meet her in the streets tomorrow , " says the Nipper , so he does not acknowledge her moving along this interior highway ( 79 ) . Because Dombey always forgets Florence , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the pilgrimage and the wilderness : " She dreamed of seeking her father in wildernesses , of following his track up fearful heights , and down into deep mines and caverns " ( 591 ) . Dickens describes Florence 's psychological pilgrimage as an attempt " to learn the road o a hard parent 's heart , " as a journey " along that stony road which ended in her father 's heart " ( 397,477 ) . <p> The argument has been made that " in a house we all feel of the proper proportions . Everything is subordinated to us , fashioned for our use and our pleasure , " but only a true Dombey could say such a thing and mean it . Oscar Wilde , whose argument it is , goes on to say with very un-Dombeyesque irony that " egotism itself , which is so necessary to a proper sense of human dignity , is entirely the result of indoor life . " In other words , exaggerated notions of identity and individuality are a " phantasmagoria of the interior , " a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence Dombey in mind , without some positive attachment or creative relationship to a definite space , one can not develop a sense of self at all . The question is whose egotism is the result of what kind of indoor life . Dombey 's house is designed to lionize Dombey and inflict a sense of powerlessness on those who live in that " wilderness of a home " under his authority . The interior design ( imposing grand staircase , large hall , and gorgeously decorated rooms ) produces the same effect as being lost in the " wild wilderness of London . " While this is the substance of Dickens 's complaint against Dombey , Dickens will not replace this kind of indoor life with one in which Florence might achieve a more measured sense of proportion . Instead , Dombey will grant her the inflated status of domestic angel , which is so necessary to a proper sense of Victorian domesticity , but which is , for Florence , just as unmanageable and still in Dombey 's control . <p> In Ruskin 's formulation , the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is protected by " a true wife " who embodies the idea called home : " Wherever a true wife comes , this ideal homes is always round her . The stars only may be over he head ; the glow-worm in the night-cold grass may be the only fire at her foot : but home is yet wherever she is " ( Ruskin 145-9 ) . For Ruskin , a proper home is not so much a structure that can be invades or abandoned as it is a woman who can identify with an ideal image of herself . Dombey , however , resists even the image of female authority because he confuses that image with real power for women in the domestic sphere : his problem is that he does not understand the ideological nature of ideology . He refuses to recognize Florence and rejects her even as an element of his interior decor . The only ornament Dombey ever imagines with " luxurious satisfaction " is not an angelic woman but the name of the firm " in a device of flowers , " a domesticated emblem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 49 ) . Dombey sins against the angel in the house by usurping her place and perverting her role , becoming " the beadle of private life ; the beadle of our business and bosoms " ( 313 ) . <p> The house of Dombey and Son is not build around an image of domesticated femininity ; rather , it is built in Dombey 's image , the image of misguided patriarch . The house wears " a frown upon its never-smiling face , " and its " glowering visage , with its thin lips parted wickedly ... surveys all comers from above the archway of the door " ( 109,393 ) . It 's " great wide areas containing cellars are frowned upon by barred windows , and leered at by crooked-eyed doors leading to dustbins " ( 74 ) . Playing with a face/facade pun , Dickens argues that a man 's home is not only his castle but also the index to his soul . Like its master , the house threatens to turn its inhabitants to stone , to deprive them of the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household artifacts . Just as Fanny 's postpartum " languor " and " general absence of elasticity " are a result of living under Dombey 's petrifying influence , so Florence is likewise in danger of fading into the background , of being transformed , as Dickens imagines it , into a statue ( 53 ) : " Florence lived alone in the great dreary house , and day succeeded day , and still she lived alone ; and the blank walls looked down upon her with a vacant stare , as if they had a Gorgon-like mind to stare her youth and beauty into stone " ( 393 ) . The domestic space under Dombey 's control is barren ; Florence withers away under Dombey 's glance . Dickens thus exposes the violence inherent in envisioning the name of the firm " in a device of flowers " : the house of Dombey and Son has as its genius a " Gorgon-like mind " with the face of the Father - blank like Dombey 's , and paralyzing like William Pitt 's . <p> Just as Dickens repeats ( three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorgon-like " intent to paralyze Florence , so H.K. Browne ties together his illustrations with repeated visual details , the most important and effective of which is a bust of William Pitt the Younger . Having Dickens 's indications of " the marble lineaments of busts on pedestals , fearfully revealing themselves through veils " to work with , Browne shows Dombey 's house to be decorated with heavy , solid , overbearing art objects , making it prefigure a smaller version of the Crystal Palace ( 394 ) . As Richards argues , " Nothing happened at the Great Exhibition but the sight of things just sitting there , mute and solid " ( 30-1 ) . Sculpture dominated the Fine Arts category of the Exhibition , and the Crystal Palace was well furnished with three-dimensional figures in marble and bronze . Many of these sculptures , some of which were created long before 1851 , had already been , or later would be , reproduced in smaller sizes and sold as knickknacks . And some of the statuettes Browne places in his illustrations for Dombey and Son eventually showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pitt , in bronze , " atop the bookcases in the library - the center of Dombey 's private domain ( 109 ) , and that is where Browne puts Pitt in " The Christening Party " ( 112 ) . But Browned , acting on his own , outdoes Dickens , mass-producing the stony face in six more of his illustrations and moving it to other parts of the house . Busts of Pitt glare down on Diogenes comforting Florence ( 325 ) , on Toots kissing Susan ( 391 ) , on Edith meeting Florence ( 485 ) , on Dombey and Edith coming home from their wedding ( 527 ) , on Dombey conferring with Bagstock and Feenix ( 810 ) , and Dombey brooding alone when Florence returns at the end . Browne uses Pitt to insert a concentrated image of Dombey into scenes where Dombey himself is not present , thereby pointing up the powerful influence of the absent father-the power of male entitlement which operated even in Dombey 's absence . As Browne furnishes Dombey 's Crystal Place with portraits and busts which gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects which mirror and criticize their behavior , he is taking seriously what Dickens repeatedly suggests : men own things , and women are in danger of becoming things , of being displayed as art objects , regarded , like fanny Dombey , as " plate and furniture , " as upholstery in men 's houses ( 54 ) . <p> Appropriately , then , Pitt stares down from his cold heights when " Mr. Dombey introduces his Daughter Florence " to Edith ( 485 ) . Here , Pitt presides over the redecoration of the house in preparation for Dombey 's wedding . The bust , still guarding the bookcases in the library , has retained it position in spite of the chaos of the alterations . It has been put back in takes place after a dropcloth has been draped over the bookcases . Dickens 's description of this scene is somewhat different from Browne 's version for when Florence enters the drawing room , she notices that " her mother 's picture was gone with the rest of the moveables " ( 483 ) . Browne , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half hidden by another dropcloth , it hangs just behind Florence , as if watching over her ( Plate 2 ) . Fanny 's portrait appears again in tow more illustrations along with the bust of Pitt , as if the two were vying for attention and precedence , for control of the drawing room . <p> Indeed , as the story progresses , Pitt and Dombey , who usually stare down on anything playful of feminine , gradually begin to seem more threatened than threatening . After Edith runs off with Carker , her husband 's villainous business manager , the house turns on Dombey ; his own face reproaches him . Dombey " feels that the world is looking at him , " and " that Mr. Pitt , upon the bookcase , represents it " ( 809 ) . And " Mr. Dombey and the World " shows Fanny 's portrait , hanging directly above the chimneyglass in the place of honor , partially covered by a veil or curtain ( 810 ) . One of her eyes is just visible , and Pitt appears to be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depiction of Dombey 's house , Pitt is again glancing nervously at the portrait of Fanny , which is looking right back at him . The portrait is partly visible behind a large embroidered or painted folding screen which separates it from the brooding Dombey . These insertions of Fanny 's portrait would seem to foreshadow he establishment of " proper " female authority in Dombey 's house.Browne exposes the portrait of fanny at precisely the same point in the novel that Dickens bring Edith into Dombey 's house to threaten him with the power of a woman 's anger . Angrily opposing Dombey , Edith created a female domain for herself and Florence . Thus , Browne places a statuette of an amazon right behind her in one of his drawings Exhibition , a gigantic zinc casting by Moritz Geiss form a life-size bronze original by August Kiss , depicting a woman riding a horse which is being attacked by a tiger or panther ( Plate 1 ) . Visitors like Dickers ( see epigraph ) were fascinated by this woman-with-a-weapon , by this battle between wild animal and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies in conflict . Neither coy nor seductive , neither a " fallen " woman nor an instance of virtue distressed , The Amazon defends herself with sheer physical strength . Likewise , Edith Dombey , by force of will , repels tigers : she threatens her husband sexually and socially . Perhaps more than any other Dickens novel , Dombey and Son dramatizes a sexual struggle for control of domestic space . Furiously reversing Dombey 's decorative alterations , Edith marginalizes Dombey in his own home by occupying its rooms with more skill than he can master , by crossing it thresholds with more feeling than he can fathom . Similarly , The Amazon asks a question about power and territory : is the woman or the tiger going to claim the horse ? Discouraging any image of domestic community , both woman and tiger climb up over the horse 's body to get at each other and fight it out . Courageous and self-possessed , the amazon seems certain to kill the tiger , to save her horse and herself . <p> Dickens refer to women who deviate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edith is " a beautiful Medusa , " and Alice 's hair is like " a heap of serpents " ( 741,565 ) . Susan Nipper claims the name of amazon in her typical way , that is , by disclaiming it : " I may not be a Amazon , Miss Floy ... but anyway I 'm not a giver up , I hope ! " ( 399 ) . The fact of deviance being the point , not the exact nature of the deviance , " Amazon " and " Medusa " are interchangeable labels , and indeed Medusa 's powerful gaze has the same effects as The Amazon 's calm courage and steady aim . An image like Kiss 's Amazon seems just as motivated by male fears as " the mythological construct of the Medusa 's head , " which , as Klaus Theweleit says in Male Fantasies , " for several millennia has haunted the emotions of men . " Theweleit describes paranoid male fantasies of " the Medusa ' in action : as visions of Spartacist women ' galloping across our path on shaggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dickens uses such sensational figures throughout the novel to remind Dombey of what he is trying to forget , what he is trying to cover up with his elaborate and perverse upholstery - women 's anger . <p> In preparation for his second marriage , Dombey redecorated his house ; calling in the " upholster 's waggon , " he arranges for full-scale alterations ( 483 ) . The middle-class habit of redecoration , unnecessary in practical terms , is a periodic display of wealth , a class signature . It also involves ritual Mr.-and-Mrs. squabbles about budgeting , choosing colors and styles : it restages the establishment of domestic authority . On a larger scale , " the design of the Crystal Palace " persuaded visitors " to believe in the transformative power of interior decoration , whereby the arrangement and presentation of manufactured objects becomes not only a model for human habitation but also a blueprint for social change " ( Richards 28-9 ) . The changes issuing form this blueprint would involve " the complete transformation of collective and private life into a space for the spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's efforts to display his commodities and reestablish himself as king of the drawing-room fail , for Edith does not play the game . William Pitt has no effect on her : completely indifferent to the decorations , she habitually ignores Dombey 's valuation of particular domestic spaces and traffic patterns . She upholsters the house in her own way by valuing only the spaces where Florence live , by crossing thresholds to be with her . Dombey , impelling Florence into liminal space and exploiting her anxious movements , intimidated and controls her , forces her upstairs , confines her to abandoned rooms , and drives her out of doors . But it is in similar spaces and through similar movements that , for much of the novel , the power of " a woman 's anger " most effectively intimidated Dombey and defends Florence . <p> In the midst of the alterations , Edith passively allows herself to be presented to Florence like an item , of " plate and furniture . " But Florence , who immediately " fell weeping on the lady 's breast , " closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edith goes to great lengths , literally , to reciprocate and prolong this exchange of feeling . Called away from Florence to tour the redecorated rooms , Edith " release her hold of Florence , and ... Withdrew hurriedly . " But moments later , while Florence is busy being " happy , sorry , joyful , and in tears , she knew no how , or how long , but all at once , " Edith walks back through the house to take Florence " in her arms again " ( 486 ) . Feeling as if Edith never left the room , Florence begins to internalize Edith 's affection , reversing the scene in which Dombey banishes her from his rooms . Form this moment on , Edith does her best to be in tow places at once and to be in them in different ways . Edith turns a medusa 's face on the men in the novel and a mother 's face on Florence . With Dombey , she plays her role of wife with a critical indifference that eventually imprisons him in his own frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without Florence , Edith is the deliberate mother , determined to substitute a powerful , premeditated performance of that role for the lack of biological relation . " I am prepared to love you , " she says to Florence - prepared , like The Amazon taking aim at the tiger , to cross any threshold for Florence , prepared , ultimately , to cross Dombey ( 486 ) . <p> Because of Edith , the atmosphere of Dombey 's house is no longer gorgon-like , but maternal and comforting . When medusa plays mother no one turns to stone . Florence no longer feels entirely " thrown away , " for Edith created an atmosphere in which a happy Florence begins to develop out of an unhappy one : " Florence went to bed in a room within Edith 's , so happy and hopeful that she thought of her late self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be pitied for her sorrow " ( 510-1 , my emphasis ) . The house now has a new nucleus - Edith 's suite - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dombey finds himself excluded from this feminine sphere within his house . Viewing the world as a collection of objects to be appraised , possessed , and forgotten , he is always " a mere spectator , " positioned on the margin , " quite shut out " ( 83 ) . Edith ignores him at every opportunity . Returning to the house after the honeymoon , " Edith sought Florence out , upon the threshold , " and " she hurried o Florence and embraced her " ( 582 ) . That night after dinner , declaring Paris " dull " and " cold , " Edith " passes the folding-doors which were thrown open to display the suite of rooms in their new and handsome garniture , and barely glancing at them as she passed , sits down by Florence , " implying that Florence 's presence is warm and interesting in contrast to Dombey 's ( 583 ) .

Dombey sits by , " hardening " under this amazon 's sexual slight ( 650 ) . <p> Dombey can not tolerate the indifference of the amazons and medusas who roam the corridors of his house . As he sees it , he is supposed to be indifferent to women ; they are not supposed to be indifferent to him . Adrienne Rich , asking why " violent strictures should be found necessary to enforce women 's total emotional , erotic loyalty and subservience o men , " argues " that the male need to control women sexually " is the result of a fear " that women could be indifferent to men altogether , " that men might find themselves " left on the periphery of the matrix . " Dombey is so excluded that even his furniture comes to life and lives without regard for him : at dinner , he stares " down into the cold depths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and decanters lay at anchor " and sees images of Edith and Florence but not himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape them " ( 510 ) . Edith is not interested in Dombey , sexually or otherwise , and as long as she lives in his house with Florence , Dombey is indeed " on the periphery of the matrix . " <p> Edith turns Dombey 's upholstery against him by playing her role to extremes ; since he has acquired her to add to his decor , she violently and obviously objectifies herself . Dickens gives Edith " a Gorgon-like intent " of her own ( 398 ) . Dining with Dombey before the wedding , Edith " Sat apart by an open window ... until Mr. Dombey took leave , " sitting " like a handsome statue : as cold , as silent , and as still " ( 510,508 ) . Likewise , after the honeymoon , she " sweeps past the gold and silver demonstration on the sideboard as if it were heaped-up dirt " and sits " like a statue , at the feast " ( 584 ) . Whenever Dombey 's name is mentioned , Edith becomes as " stately , and quiet as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " a handsome mask " 9589,590 ) . Now , as Dickens says , Dombey is " a good deal in the statue way himself " 9584 ) . He always assumed that " with Edith 's haughtiness subservient to his , " he would be " haughtier than ever , " but " he had never entertained the possibility of its arraying itself against him " ( 648 ) . " Her cold supreme indifference " is " his own unquestioned attribute usurped " ( 650 ) . <p> Angry , self-conscious , intelligent women endanger the whole patriarchal system that fosters Dombey and Son . Alice Marwood is particularly dangerous : the chapters entitled " Secret Intelligence " and " More Intelligence " deal with the dangerous knowledge she possesses . As Edith 's illegitimate " first cousin " and Carker 's jilted lover , she seems to know more about Dombey 's domestic affairs than he does himself ( 921 ) . When Dombey offers to pay for news of his runaway wife , Alice asks him , " Do you know nothing more powerful than money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger ? " She looks him in the eye and says , " A woman 's anger is pretty much the same here , as in your fine house " ( 819 ) . Most dangerous , however , is Edith 's and Alice 's knowledge that they are commodities in a system of sexual and economic exchange . Alice explains to Harriet Carker that her mother made " a sort of property of me , " and Carker " made a short-lived toy " an object constantly on display : " There is no slave in a market ... So shown and offered and examined and paraded " as she has been ( 473 ) . Dombey , " I will hold no place in you house to-morrow , or on any recurrence of to-morrow . I will be exhibited to no one , as the refractory slave you purchased " ( 748 ) . This female statue steps down form the pedestal and walks right out of Dombey 's Crystal Palace , never to return , Once granting his amazons such furious " intelligence , " Dickens can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Edith says that " more than once " when she has been looking out the window , she has seen " something in the faded likeness of my sex " walking the streets and has thought of herself as a prostitute ( 514 ) . Edith 's insistence that the drawing room is continuous with the marketplace is confirmed by what she later reads in Alice 's eyes , while Alice , looking at Edith , learns it is not only working-class women who are made into property and toys , for the two women encounter each other " upon the Downs " in " A Chance Meeting , " as it is called in the caption to the illustration of the event ( 662-3 ) . In Alice 's figure , Edith sees " something of her own air and stature , " and Alice seems " to reciprocate her own thoughts " ( 662 ) . Moreover , Edith and Alice are revealed to be related by blood : " Show me Mrs. Dombey , and I 'll show you my Alice 's first cousin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could have seen my gal , as I have seen her once , side by side with Edith , you 'd have seen for all the difference of dress and life , that they were like each other " ( 921 ) . Edith sees the likeness , Browne draws it for us , and Alice thinks , as she walks away from the encounter , " we had need to know each other when we meet again ! " ( 665 ) <p> However , they never do meet again ; their " Chance Meeting " turns out to be a mere coincidence after all , and a sympathetic narrative turns out to be ambivalent . Thus linked , the two women are all the more easily dismissed as committing the same sin against femininity : anger . Edith and Alice refuse to live up to the sanctioned image of femininity their culture imposes on them . dickens , in what seems at times like sympathy , shows us a great quantity of female anger in this novel : Alice Marwood rages and tears her hair , wanting revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against the " marble chimney-shelf , " wanting to injure both Carker and Dombey for insulting her and injuring Florence ( 692 ) . Enraged at a sexual-economic system that commodities women and sends them off to market , they find it difficult to control this sensational passion and direct their anger at its cause . Eventually they do , but the critical force of their anger is confined to the realm of personal revenge , which can , as the narrative moves towards its conclusion , be interpreted as an error for which they can be punished . <p> After acknowledging women 's complaints against Dombey , after foregrounding women 's anger at a system which destroys and degrades them , the novel ultimately separates women from their anger , and from each other . Fanny 's pathetic death , which left Florence alone in a hostile house , is reenacted , rather than remedied , many times : Dombey dismisses the nursemaids Polly Toodle and Susan Nipper ; both Edith and Alice lose their mother ; Florence loses the exiled Edith , and Harriet Carker loses her repentant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one way or another , impossible . These angry amazons , all finally seen as sensational examples of female aberration , disappear from the story . Likewise , Dickens himself dismisses The Amazon in the Crystal Palace from conscious memory and can not even be sure he has seen it . Instead , as the " subject of so much fantasy " - male fantasy in particular - " these imagined pariahs " become " central " to male " identity and self-definition " ( Warner 279-80 ) . Ultimately such female figures serve the purpose of sustaining patriarchal aims , of redecorating Dombey 's identity . <p> Through Edith , the novel seems to lament like J.S. Mill that " the totally different bringing-up of the two sexes make it next to an impossibility to form a really well-assorted union " : in the end , Edith tells Florence , " when I thought so much of all the causes that had made me what I was , I needed to have allowed more for the causes that had made Dombey what he was " ( 968 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles , " two friends of the same sex , who are much associated in their daily life , " would be more likely to achieve the ideal of the companionate marriage ( Mill 233 ) . Despite the cluster of comic wedding cluttering up its conclusion , Dombey and Son ultimately lends support to this idea : the most intense moments of emotional connection are between members of the same sex , and the most developed and complicated relations are between women , with the most convincing reconciliations and compromises worked out between mothers and daughters . <p> Using Dombey 's domestic life against him opens up question of sexual politics with which Dickens is not quite comfortable . The novel purges relationships between women , saving and eventually fore-grounding the simpler , more sentimental , easily achieved relations between the male characters . Edith 's love for Florence works , finally , not against Dombey but against Edith . More aligned with Dombey on this point than he realizes , Dickens sees " compressed into the one handsome face " of his medusa " the burning indignation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he translates the look on Edith 's face into a paranoid vision of an army of angry amazons ( 472 ) . Having employed Medusa 's gaze against Dombey , Dickens finds he must cover her face , having invited the amazon into Dombey 's house , he fins he must banish her . The power of " a woman 's anger " is so dangerous that Dickens suppresses it before it really develops . <p> The narrative shifts from exposing the monstrous father in his monstrous house to transferring that monstrosity to women who are eliminated from the novel . Thus , angry Alice finally turns out to be so susceptible to the middle-class charms of charitable Harriet Carker that she falls ill , presumably beneath the weight of her sinful past , and dies . " I took up with the belief that duty had not been done to me , " the dying Alice says to Harriet , but " that is all past . It is like a dream , now , which I can not quite remember or understand " ( 922 ) . Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired by Harriet 's " kind face " ( 922-3 ) . Alice 's " intelligence " fades , as Dickens uses the angel in the house to subdue her rebellious sister . Earlier sympathy turns to disapproval when he warns those readers who sympathized with Alice too much : " Scorn , rage , defiance , recklessness , look here ! This is the end " ( 919 ) . A reduced , penitent Alice , " shrinking with her face behind her hand , " says to Harriet , " you brought me here , by force of gentleness and kindness , ... you made me human by woman 's looks and words , and angel 's deeds ! " ( 920 , my emphasis . ) Seduced by an image of virtuous , domesticated womanhood , medusa recants , covering her face . <p> The novel substitutes the comforts of the middle-class drawing room for a " round world of many circles within circles " where " extremes touch " ; it replaces Alice 's political consciousness with upholstery ( 579 ) . By the same means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider , for instance , the geologist Gideon Mantell 's report of a visit to the Crystal Palace : Went again to the Exhibition ; the crowed tremendous ... Vulgar , ignorant , country people : many dirty women with their infants were sitting on the seats giving suck with their breasts uncovered , beneath the lovely female figures of the sculptor . Oh ! how I wished I had the power to petrify the living , and animate the marble : perhaps a time will come when this fantasy will be realised and the human breed be succeeded by finer forms and lovelier features , than the world now dreams of . <p> For Mantell , this is perhaps a fitting fantasy , to consort Pygmalion-like with perfectly sculpted females . The marble bodies of the Crystal Palace - inanimate , sterile , pure , noble - tempt him to dismiss the active , vital , sexual bodies of real working-class women . In this fantasy of a more upholstered world , evolution is a process of reification in which women disappear beneath the ideological burden they bear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dickens , like Dombey and Mantell , now finds it necessary to " petrify the living . " When Edith abandons Dombey and his house , she encounters Florence on the staircase : " crouching down against the wall , " convinced of her inferiority , Edith " crawled by her like some lower animal , sprang up , and fled away " ( 754 ) . Browne 's illustration of the scene shows Edith descending Dombey 's grand staircase ( as well as the evolutionary scale ) , leaving behind her several paintings and sculptures that speak of maternal feelings and domestic virtues ( Plate 4 ) . The next , and last , time we see Edith in one of the illustrations , she is resolutely allied with The Amazon ( see Plate 3 ) . Florence , however , is on her way up that staircase , soon to embody those feelings and virtues . When the two women meet for the last time , Florence has completely internalized that same " staircase , " that hierarchy of loyalties which Edith descends and rejects - but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failed to " reconcile " her feelings for her father and her step-mother , Florence is effectively absorbed into a transformed Dombey 's transformed household ( 701 ) . As the two women say goodbye , we see them hardening into their final postures : Edith " dumb and motion less , " resigned to exile , and Florence keeping her distance , doing her " duty to Papa " ( 964-5 ) . <p> At the top of this staircase , under a glass dome , Browne draws a small statue of a woman riding a panther or bear to represent Florence 's destiny : this statuette is tranquil and relaxed , telling a more conventional story than The Amazon about what makes women . Allegorical representations of women taming or consorting with animals were widely current ( and perhaps have always been ) , and this piece resembles The Lion in Love by the Belgian sculptor Guillaume Geefs ( Plate 5 ) . Like The amazon , this sculpture was exhibited at the Crystal Place , and a contemporary observer explained that this group " allegorically represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . Unable to resist the seducing loveliness of a nude female who is seated on his back and fascinating him with her eyes , is quietly submitting to be deprived of his claws " ( Gibbs-Smith 127 ) . The Lion in Love presents a powerful fantasy of domestic life as a sexual/social contract between the sexes that grants women authority : inside this circle ( created by the lion 's uplifted foreleg. continuing through his gaze , and descending in the curve of her arm ) , woman 's innate virtue ( note her neatly bound hair ) corrects man 's natural savagery ( see his shaggy mane ) to make the world a better place . <p> The Lion in Love was inspired by Aesop 's fable of the same name , which tells a story different from Geefs 's . In the fable , the lion sees a forester 's daughter , falls in love , and asks for the girl in marriage . The father craftily agrees , on condition that he be allowed to remove the lion 's teeth and claws , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love to think clearly , consent . No sooner is he toothless and declawed , than the forester attacks him . The moral of the story warns that love is dangerous ( for the lion ) . Geefs 's interpretation , however , not only suppresses the father 's violence but transfers it to the daughter and sexualizes it . It covers one story with another and invents a relationship between the two characters who in the fable do not interact - the woman and the lion . The woman 's seductive behavior is pure upholstery , a narrative embellishment that disguises the cause-and-effect relationship in the fable . The woman 's sensationally fore-grounded and sexualized body disguises a story of paternal violence , preempts the realization that women are sacrificed to power exchanges between men , and precludes even the implication that a woman might resist rather than cooperate . And since the statue does not suggest the eventual violence against the lion , it offers men a vision of the pleasure of sexual submission . It implies that the risks are acceptable , that a lion , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , king of all the beasts in the drawing room . Thus , in the interest of supporting patriarchal ideals of domesticity , the sculpture obscures of upholsters male violence with a fantasy of female power . <p> The conclusion of Dombey and Son has often been read as a triumph for Florence and defeat for Dombey . Julian Moynahan reads the novel as a struggle of " Firmness versus Wetness , " and deplores the shift from " a tensely masculine world " to " a slackly feminine one . " In his reading , Florence castrates Dombey , who is finally the victim of " a maundering , guilt-ridden submission to feminine softness . A Victorian patriarchy of stiff and tyrannical men of affairs surrenders to a matriarchy of weeping mothers and daughters " ( 130 ) . Moynahan seems to prefer the faults of that patriarchy to the indignities of that matriarchy - which , in any case , is an invention of his disgust with things sentimental and " feminine , " for most of the mothers and daughters are dead or gone by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the novel 's conclusion but does not see through Dickens 's upholstery to the situation beneath . Dombey is still more powerful than Florence : as a sentimental patriarch , he recovers his position at the center of all feeling and action . His male privileges ( violence and misogyny ) are not eradicated , only forgotten , upholstered . <p> Dickens associates the collapse of Dombey 's houses with Dombey 's collapse into feeling . Finally , the " great House " of Dombey and Son in the City is " down , " " published " in the " List of Bankrupts , " and the private house Dombey and Son is empty , ready to be sold , it s lease " to be disposed of " ( 908,942 ) . At the return of his long-absent daughter , Dombey " felt her draw his arms about her beck ; he felt her put her own round his ; he felt her kisses on his face ; he felt her wet cheek laid against his own ; he felt - oh , how deeply ! - all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Dombey feels , and has done with houses . Dickens and Browne took great pains to make that hose speak to Dombey of his errors , but Dickens now deserts the argument which was so inseparable from his descriptions of Dombey 's house - that Dombey must swallow his masculine pride and learn to live with women . Consider the ominous refrain . " Let his remember it in that room , years to come , " threatening eventual punishment for Dombey 's neglect of Florence ( 329 , my emphasis ) . For the duration of half a chapter , Dombey does " remember it . In agony , in sorrow , in remorse , in despair ! " ( 934 ) . But Dombey 's brief reunion with Florence " in that room " leads to no serious conversation or substantial resolution of past problems . The painful memories disappear with the room while dickens merely repeats over and over that " the house is a ruin , and the rats fly from it " ( 923,928,929 ) . <p> Dombey 's punishment , the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house has the effect of emptying the novel of its women , and Dombey need never again struggle to live in a house full of them . Dickens does not rebuild Dombey 's private house , nor does he replace it with Florence and Walter Gay 's house . There is vague mention of a house " out of London ... away on the borders of a fresh heath , " but no description , no details , no new house in which we see a now happily married Florence and a reformed Dombey getting to know each other ( 955-6 ) . Once so acutely aware of women 's status as " plate and furniture " in Dombey 's " wilderness of a home , " so careful to describe " the wild wilderness of London , " Dickens sketches a vague , shifting , expansive scene in the " Final " chapter . The novel ends on " the sea-beach " with the " ceaseless murmuring " of the waves under a bright " shining " sky ( 975-6 ) . Rather than restructure domestic relations , Dickens redecorates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed , and emotional , never comes to terms with the difficulties women brought to bear against him - he is occupied with memories no more disturbing than the soft sea air , no more intrusive than the gentle waves . The conclusion is more soft than solid , more comfortable than convincing . <p> Dickens prepares a complete nervous breakdown for Dombey , from which he will emerge transformed - into The Lion in Love . The Dombey of the first chapter resists what the Dombey of the last chapter accepts : a sentimental Dombey is a better man , the Lion in Love the better tiger . Dombey simply gives in to more profitable feelings , and yielding ultimately delivers a higher yield than resistance . Years before , Dombey did experience one " yielding moment " toward Florence ( 586 ) . Sunk deep into " an easy chair " in " a shadowy corner " of the drawing room , he had " covered his head with a handkerchief " and looked at his daughter as if through a " veil " ( 585-6 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible ( like the father in the sculpture ) and changed Florence 's appearance ( as Geefs revises the daughter 's ) . Dombey " saw he for an instant by a clearer and a brighter light " as " a household spirit bending at his feet , " and realized he " had a happy home within his reach " ( 586 ) . The realization passed when Edith entered the room , but now , with Edith exiled , Dombey will acquiesce and see everything through that veil of sentiment , that distorting , self-serving upholstery . Bluntly put , since beating Florence did not destroy her influence , Dombey can have her " bending at his feet " if he joins her.Such Sentimental conclusions are , or course , the stuff of nine-tenth-century novels . Philippa Tristram notices that , during the course of the century , fictional descriptions of domestic spaces gradually change : walls , once significant , " become almost invisible " and are internalized , while " object " once beneath description " positively jostle for attention " and occupy the foreground ( 229 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that " the very solidity of Victorian interiors was partly the result of an effort to disguise their transient nature " ( 261 ) . But Dickens takes this upholstery project a step farther in the aftermath of Dombey 's bankruptcy : the display of emotions , replacing the display of commodities , disguises Dombey 's failures as husband and father . Walls and houses disappear to disguise the continuity of Dombey 's character , and the upholstery of Dombey 's sentimentality obscures the fact the Dombey still does not like women . <p> Foregrounding a redecorated Dombey , the last chapter are meant to convince us that he and his daughter are now in sympathy rather that at odds . Dombey 's response to his granddaughter demonstrated that Dombey finally acquires competence in the " feminine " realm of sentiment and domesticity , the he can behave more like Florence than Florence ( weep and grieve for himself and other , gaze lovingly at , worry about , and over-identify with others ) . Dombey 's feelings for this child occupy his mind , agitate his imagination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bear to see a cloud upon her face . He can not bear to see her sit apart . He fancies that she feels a slight , when there is none " ( 975 ) . Even the novel 's last amazon . Susan Nipper , completely disarmed by Dombey 's displays of sentiment , is convinced . Recovering from his collapse , Dombey calls Susan to his bedside to prove that " Florence and he were very different now ... and very happy . Let her look at this ! He meant his drawing the gentle head down to his pillow , and laying it beside him " ( 958 ) . Managing and manipulating Florence with his caresses , Dombey can show her off , present her as proof of his fatherly feeling . And Susan , always complained , " girls are thrown away in this house , " she now expressed Dombey 's desires for him , saying , " from Dombey 's daughter , after all , another Dombey and Son will ... rise ... triumphant ! " ( 974 ) . By playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism . <p> Dombey finally accepts the idea of the angel in the house , but Florence 's final position in Dombey 's family is no more stable than it ever was . Just as the once disruptive Edith is exiled , her movements on the Continent rendered meaningless in comparison to their former oppositional force in Dombey 's drawing room , so the once disturbing Florence is powerless because there are no thresholds for her to cross , no rooms for her to mark with her presence . Without doorways , hallways , and stairways , exclusions are invisible , distances immeasurable , and distinctions unmanageable . When Florence is finally elevated to the status of an image of domestic virtue , her actual position and location in any house is no longer important . A figure of ideal virtue , the angel in the house has corrective influence over undomesticated men only in the context of their failure and error ( most visible and keenly felt within domestic spaces ) . Erasing all the spatial boundaries and thresholds which provoked women 's anger , the novel 's conclusion provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , Florence is once again overshadowed by her father , fading into the background - all the more so because she is now " always with him " and always in his thoughts ( 957 ) . Paradoxically , Dombey is more aware of her when he consciously detests her . When Florence occupied her own rooms in Dombey 's house , her own separate space , Dickens focused on her , gave her details and depth . But when she is " always with " her father , Dickens 's attention drifts to Dombey ( 970 ) . When Dombey stops opposing Florence and starts imitating her , when his violent misogyny turns to pacific indifference , he is finally undisturbed by her presence . The novel translates Dombey 's violent hatred of Florence into mindless kisses and strategic caresses . Florence makes it to the end of that " stony road " to " her father 's heart , " but she might as well be back in his old house , for there is little difference between that " Gorgon-like " house and " her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate and furniture , " the novel 's conclusion disguises women 's final status as such . <p> Florence is finally embedded in Dombey 's new upholstery just as deeply as the female figures which were sometimes sculpted into furniture frames ( Plat 6 ) . This particular sofa by Jackson &; Graham insists that the skeleton of the piece is female and domestic , not manmade and industrial . The female body emerging from beneath the deep curves of the cushioning brings to mind anything but the metal springs and machine-turned wooden frame that actually support the sister . Moreover , that sculpted body is a solid sign that Woman 's in the home and all 's right with the world . As the pillar of the household , she is immobilized : decorous drapery , lashed around her waist , ties her securely to the home , and she possesses no lower limbs , only those other Victorian unmentionables - sofa legs . Sexually available , she is not herself sexual : her invisible hands are bound above her head , raising her exposed breasts just within the reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she has no genitals . This domestic woman need not ( indeed , can not ) do anything except exist : a purely decorative object d'art , she is not the image of a household manager . Florence is finally idealized as " the most beautiful , the most amiable , the most angelic of her sex , " but she serves as an image sanctifying the sentiments that circulate within a male community of feeling ( 973 ) . Such idealization manifests itself in practical terms as a thorough-going in-difference . Avoiding a real relationship with Florence leaves Dombey with room and energy for more comfortable pursuits , the pleasures of male companionship . <p> Unlike any other in the novel , the " Final " chapter is divided with blank lines into three scenes , each shift introduced with a reference to " the last bottle of the old Madeira . " Symbolic of sentimental investments finally matured , the " golden wine " is " brought into the sunshine " where it " sheds a lustre " over the ranks of the sentimental minor characters : Sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toots . Shunning them earlier , Dombey joins then now to drink " To Walter and his wife " Florence . Like the entire chapter , this first scene is suffused with golden light and peopled with glowing male faces : Captain Cuttle " beams with joy . There is a very halo of delight round his glowing forehead , " and Dombey 's face , thought marked with " care and suffering , " is nevertheless as " clear " as the " evening . " The conversation is vacuous , and the conversants are fairly bursting with satisfaction . Once could hardly imagine a more congenial Dombey than this one who chats about the wine , " nods at the Captain , " echoes the toast , addresses Florence as " my child - and turns to kiss her . " The last lines of the scene focus on Captain Cuttle who " exhibits a strong desire to clink his glass against some other glass " and Dombey , who " with a ready hand , holds out his . " This bright vision of domestic bliss fades out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merry ringing , as of a little peal of marriage bells " ( 970 ) . One might well ask : who has married whom ? With whom is the Lion in love ? <p> A triumphant Dombey now basks in the light of what Eve Sedgwick , describing Pickwick , calls " an image of the family that is in fact appropriate to none of the affectional or cohabitant groupings in the novel . " Dombey sits at the center of a group of male friends and relatives , much like Dickens reading his work to his spellbound male associates ( Plate 7 ) . This extended male family is too large and , as this last chapter suggests , too happy to live in one house or any house . Presumably , the unspecified setting is the " parlour behind the little Midshipman , " but not necessarily ( 89 ) . Capable of upholstering any space , fellow feeling usurps the function of hoses to " encourage manliness . " From Dombey 's expressive face and Captain Cuttle 's " speechless gratification , " Dickens builds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " immaterial walls " ( 970 ) . <p> Within the " immaterial walls " of this Crystal Palace of the spirit , women can be more effectively forgotten than ever before . Florence is ever present , by also more passive than ever , displaced by her sentimental father , Captain Cuttle , and her own children . With its lack of physical limits and definite thresholds , the novel 's final community of feeling is more exclusive than Dombey 's house was . Though he punishes Dombey for refusing the ideology of separate spheres , Dickens , too , escapes the issue by diving he plot between competing male households : the vision of " Dombey and Son " in " a device of flowers , " which so entranced Dombey at the beginning , is replaced at the end with " GILLS AND CUTTLE , " names which " shine refulgent " in " golden characters " ( 971 ) . Dickens has consistently sanctioned " the home of Walter 's Uncle , " and , in the end , the resolution of class differences among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Captain Cuttle usurps Florence 's place next to Dombey in the final domestic scene , and in the friendship between these two men , we see that Dombey 's character is now upholstered in Florence 's style : Dombey behaves like Florence without altering his behavior toward her . <p> The glass-and-steel architecture of the real Crystal Palace " disoriented the traditional perception of space , " for " the impression of glass architecture can be summed up in one word : evanescence ... the space of ferrovitreous architecture appeared as pure and abstract light-space " ( Schivelbusch 47 ) . As an attempt to roof over both the outer world and the domestic world , the Great Exhibition represented neither and produced something else altogether . The bright , breezy charm of Dickens 's conclusion , similarly disorienting and distracting , seems to move beyond any notion of separate spheres . With this evasion of domestic space , the novel suggests the separate spheres ideology is unworkable . Dombey begins the novel " looking out through the glass room " of his dark , gloomy house ( 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , golden , and unbounded , still protect and preserves his feelings . In the " pure and abstract light-space " of this last chapter , women have no place . Florence , only a faint presence at the table with Dombey and Captain Cuttle , is kissed but says nothing . There is finally so much " feminine " feeling circulating among the men of the reconstituted family that women , and their criticisms of Dombey , are forgotten . <p> Dombey and Son rises question Dickens was interested in exploring but eventually found too disturbing to sustain . In spite of the hopes Dickens raises , Dombey and Son will never " be a Daughter after all " ( 298 ) . That Dickens can not in the end represent men and women living together in houses suggests the problem was felt to be real and pressing . Sensational images of female resistance provide the occasion for the reconsolidation of domestic ideology , yet only the inflated upholstery of male sentimentality , the bright , golden vision of a redecorated Dombey , can fill the void left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic woman functions as a kind of upholstery disguising the fact that a man 's home is his castle , the specter of an angry , powerful woman , disloyal to the ideal of the angel in the hose , haunts the drawing room s of the nineteenth century . Just as the comfortably upholstered railway carriage provides only the illusion of safety and does not eliminate the very real possibility of railway accidents , so the notion of an angelic domestic woman creates only the illusion of a female sphere of culture . Not even the continuous production of images of domestic angels can truly prevent domestic derailments or guarantee women 's cooperation with that feminine ideal . In Browne 's last illustration for the novel , the portrait of Fanny is still competing with the bust of Pitt . The hard frame and the coiled spring remain beneath the heavy padding an the deep buttoning . And " even as a silenced ' zone , the female voice competes and contests for authority " in a community of voices . <p> Likewise , as a large-scale Victorian drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aspects of the same figure . Diagrams of the layout of the exhibits show that The Amazon and The Lion in Love would have been situated relatively close together in the Foreign Nave . Viewed side by side , these two statues comment on each other , Kiss 's statue suggesting there may be an amazon in every woman , and Geefs 's statue upholstering that amazon . One can almost imagine how , as her muscles dissolve to soft flesh , the amazon lays down her spear , which becomes a nail-clipper ; at the same time . The tiger metamorphoses into a big , soft , lazy lion , more spaniel than feline , but a carnivore nonetheless . And yet Geefs 's upholstered Lion in Love can not completely eliminate the disruptive power of The Amazon . What The Lion upholsters and forgets , The Amazon still exposes and remembers . And no matter how they saw her , visitors to the Crystal Palace remembered The Amazon . Dickens did . NOTES <p> 1 .

Richards points out that " no single element of the Crystal Palace was new ; the Victorian taste for luxury , ostentation , and outward show had long been reflected on the stage as well s on the street and inside the home . What the Crystal Palace did was to synthesize and systemize these elements of spectacle by putting them all together under one roof in the service of manufactured objects " ( 21 ) .

It is possible to read the label " Gorgon-like " to mean a gender-neutra or masculine force that petrifies . This , in fact , is how the OED interprets Dickens , quoting the usage " Gorgon-like " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " objective and instrumental , " quite separate from the definitions in which monstrous femininity is important . <p> 12 . The Art-Journal Illustrated Catalogue explains that Geiss produced a " half life-size " copy of august Kiss 's The Amazon that was " admirably calculated for gardens in England " ( 37 ) . Browne puts a small reproduction of a statue very much like The Amazon in the hotel room with Edith and Carker ( Plate 3 ) . Michael Steig points out that advertisements for reproductions of John Bell 's Purity ( also exhibited at the Palace ) appear in one of the monthly numbers of Dombey and Son , and Browne seems to have placed a similar reproduction in his illustration of " Florence and Edith on the Staircase " ( Plate 4 ) , Dickens and Phiz ( Bloomington : Indiana UP , 1978 ) 102 .

Jane R.

Neither Cohen nor Steig pay attention to Pitt 's frequent appearance in Browne 's drawing : Cohen notices a " pompous bust overhead " in the picture of Florence meeting Edith but never notices it elsewhere or recognizes it as Pitt ( 96 ) . Steig notices " Pitt 's bust " in " Mr. Dombey and the World " and in the scene of Florence 's return but no where else ( 103 , 108 ) . John Robert Harvey says merely that " the bust of Mr. Pitt is a further detail given pointed use both by dickens and by Browne : in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflecting his expression and projecting its stony nature onto him , " Victorian Novelists and their Illustrators ( New York : NYU Press , 1971 ) 142 . <p> 15 .

See Steig ( 104-5 ) and Cohen ( 99 ) for other discussions of this illustration . Neither Steig nor Cohen suggests Kiss 's statue as a source for Browne . Both focus more on the painting above Edith 's head , which depicts Judith and Holofernes . <p> 17 . Additionally , in Browne 's drawings , Mrs. MacStinger is accompanied by print of a foundering ship labelled " Medusa " ( recalling the notorious French shipwreck whose aftermath Gericault treated in The Raft of the " Medusa " ) , and by a poster referring to an " Amazon " ( 642 , 951 ) . <p> 18 .

Harvey notes the static quality of the illustration of this scene : " Wh the text offers a noble sentimental drama of beautiful women , Browne adopts a sedate and dignified manner , with a majestic architectural backdrop and elegant properties , and we can see that the tow beautiful women are playing parts " ( 139 ) . <p> 25 . Cohen , however , refers to this statuette as " a fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 ) . <p> 26 . Steig ( 101-3 ) discusses possible sources for Browne 's statuette , among them John Bell 's Purity and Heinrich Dannecker 's Ariadne . In spite of the more obvious similarity to Dannecker 's work , I find comparisons with The Lion in Love to be more fruitful . I have not been able to date this sculpture . Richards explains that " the little cards , so hard to read , that accompanied each exhibited article rarely told their readers when and where the article was invented , much less who used it and for what purposes . Unlike a museum , the Exhibition made it extremely difficult to pinpoint the origins of individual objects " ( 60 ) . The point was , rather , to overwhelm the visitors with the spectacle of the glorified commodity .

Richards provides a diagram which places The Amazon in the middle of Eastern Avenue only two sections down from the Belgian exhibits , which include a group of " statuary " also occupying the avenue ( 26 ) .
