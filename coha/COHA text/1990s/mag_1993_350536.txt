When Bobby Ray Inman goes up to Capitol Hill for confirmation hearings in January , he will not have any talking dogs with him . He does n't need them . " Talking dogs " is what the Pentagon calls the notebook-carrying aides who sit behind senior officers , looking things up to whisper into their " masters ' " ears . Inman has a memory that is close to total recall . He can , and does , speak cogently for half an hour without notes and answer questions on almost any topic . It is a skill that has helped make the retired admiral a legendary figure in Washington , though most Americans have never heard of him . <P> " Legendary " is no exaggeration , as the salvos of praise saluting his nomination as Defense Secretary attest . His friends and colleagues keep using the same words : " brilliant " and " honest " and " decisive . " He impresses and astonishes people , even the blase power brokers of the capital . The fame and admiration are real , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bookish fellow named Bobby Ray ( he hates it and will settle for Bob ) from East Texas who joined the Navy 's officer-training program during the Korean War . <P> Standing beside Bill Clinton at the White House last week , Inman described himself as an " operator . " He meant , in military terms , an officer in charge of operations  --  but it has another echo in Washington . Networking is one of his great strengths . He is smart and powerful as well as soft-spoken and approachable . So much so that everyone wants to be his friend . Though some think he is a Republican , he is registered as an independent . " He has extraordinary bipartisan support , " says Walt Rostow , who was Lyndon Johnson 's hawkish National Security Adviser . Ron Dellums , the dovish chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , calls Inman a " brilliant thinker . " Most members of Congress value Inman for his straight answers even about secret and sensitive programs . " Admiral Inman always tells the truth , " says Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is at least as good with the press as White House spinmaster Dave Gergen . <P> Inman is also loyal and willing to stake his name on controversial associates  --  within clearly demarcated limits . For example , Inman wrote a letter last year to a U.S. district court judge in Philadelphia commending the " patriotism " of arms merchant James Guerin , who has since been sentenced to 15 years for fraud and smuggling weapons to South Africa . While he praised Guerin for providing the U.S. with " information obtained during his foreign travels , " Inman did not ask the court for leniency . <P> If the ability to speak well is important , so is the audience . As a young lieutenant , Inman landed on the staff of Admiral Arleigh Burke , then Chief of Naval Operations , and became Burke 's favorite briefer . " He is one of the great briefers of our time , " says former FBI and CIA director William Webster . It is a talent important men treasure : someone who tells you everything you need to know quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little backstabbing . " Most people , " says retired Rear Admiral Don Harvey , a friend , " were able to spot that this was a creature not of their ken . He was so good it decreased the normal competition .
