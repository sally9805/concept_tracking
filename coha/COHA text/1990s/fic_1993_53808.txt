When she needed to say something just to hear the sound of her own voice , she said " Sam , " struck to find his name on the tip of her tongue : she would have reasoned she was so angry that his name would have needed some summoning up , but no . <p> The stream tilling past Jenny 's boots ran , with erosion , the reflectionless soft cafe au lait of adobe . She waded with what she told herself was caution , fearing a submerged strand of barbed wire . Rain had sleeked her T-shirt to her skin , and each breath was a brief-lived heartache , so cold was the air , so charged with ozone . The arroyo 's far wall was washing out in a dangerously deep arch , a red-clay cave marbled with exposed juniper roots and resonant with lapping water . Crouching , she counted twenty or more cigarette butts in a wobbling raft . The Delgado kids played in there , however often she asked them not to . Purely from self-consciousness , Jenny was charming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-eyed , truant Delgados failed to take her seriously . Jenny dragged sandbags back into alignment in the low wall meant to stave off further erosion . The adobe slip that smoothed the burlap weave greased her freezing hands . The wall was useless . Sam needed to assess the damage and come up with their next move . Sam needed to warn the Delgados about keeping their three boys out of the arroyo , which flooded fast , often more than knee-deep , after rains like this evening 's . The last time she 'd talked to them , the two older boys stood pitching stones at a fence post while the smallest , who liked Jenny , stared ashamed at the toes of his sneakers , his unthrown stone in his fist . She was afraid for them : it had made her voice hard , frankly forceful , and of course they 'd hated that . And still had n't  --  the cigarette butts proved  --  listened . <p> Jenny sat heavily on a sandbag that soaked through the seat of her jeans . Her neck was bitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working air that seemed too cold for them . From here , a corner of the house was visible , though it was fading fast . The bedroom window , whose blue shutters were the secret reason she 'd agreed with Sam to buy the house , was n't lit . A trick she could have learned in ten days alone : Leave a light on when you go out near dark . A scrap of paper blew shyly past her shoulder , winced and was alive , hyper , a bat after mosquitoes . Echoing back . and forth between the arroyo 's walls , more bats . Between clouds , the moon emerged , the dazzling white of fireworks , to cast her shadow down running water . <p> Sam has been sleeping , with his Army surplus bag and a borrowed futon , on the cement slab that will be the floor of a greenhouse , the roof already raised in bright blond two-by-fours . A cat crouches on Sam 's chest at dawn , tucking its paws under and purring . The first time the cat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . <p> " Dying ? " <p> " I wake up thinking heart attack , and it takes me a minute : cat . No , it 's a cat . My heart 's going wham wham wham , and gradually I figure out this means it 's still working . " He 'd told this to Jenny long distance last night , expecting her laugh , counting on her laugh , and what did Jenny say ? " Are you coming home ? " <p> " Ever ? " he answered , and she noted the hushed exhale that meant he was smoking a cigarette she would have bitched at him about if she 'd been surer of his mood . He was calling from half an hour distant , from the Santa Fe place of the couple whose greenhouse he was building . The greenhouse was ambitious , passive solar , and he 'd told Jenny it could easily need another month . Another month . " How are you ? " he asked . A Sam tactic : Try acting as if nothing 's wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This disingenuousness got them out of various scrapes , at least those neither of them wanted , or wanted badly enough , to be in . <p> " I hate the nights . " <p> " You 'll be fine . " <p> " ' You 'll be fine ' is how you blow away whatever serious thing I 've just said . " She blew across the receiver , vehement illustration , and was surprised by a faint zinging reverberation like a tuning fork 's . <p> " Jenny , all I mean is I know you . You will be fine . " <p> Fine alone ? Or fine with you ? is what she did n't ask next . Maybe we need this time apart is what she did n't provoke him into saying . <p> Jenny waded back down the arroyo and climbed the skiddy path between drifts of Christmas-tree scent that were wet junipers in the dark . Cascades from the gutters  --  canales , she amended  --  foamed down the footers for the porch  --  portal , in Spanish  --  she and Sam had imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table homesteaded by their clutter of spoons and saucers , Jenny 's gloves , Sam 's watch cap , its navy wool glittering with the clear pinheads that snowflakes shrank to in the close cafe warmth . A hundred futures for their house have appeared on napkins , torn envelopes , the backs of checks for two cups of coffee . However fitful , this was their deepest conversation , these sketches one or the other of them pushed away from the wet ring left by a lifted cup . In this exchange , they played hookie from themselves . Sam grew covetous , ingenious , rash , Jenny sober , calm , calculating , adding up , sometimes aloud , the probable cost of his schemes . They argued more or less softly . When she was pregnant , Jenny began drawing a child into the sketches . The child had an agile , compact body and heavy , fair , straight , stick-straight , bowl-cut hair that could n't completely hide its too-large ears , but it did n't confront the viewer ( her , Sam ) directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dawned on Jenny that she kept drawing the same child . <p> Something else occurred to Sam . " You draw a kid , never a baby . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So you skip the worst helplessness . The first year  --  entire , total dependency . " <p> " You think I 'm frightened . " She was more interested than accusing , though she was a little accusing . <p> " I think you 're smart to be frightened . " <p> Just inside the front door , Jenny dropped her clothes in a mud-died knot . Her jeans had grown skinny and cold and had to be weaseled out of . She stood pale , even in the dark , hugging herself . Ah : there was still , despite the storm , electricity . The bathroom went bright at a touch . She bathed in water so hot it was primarily consoling , a cirrus of steam lolling from its surface , like a hot spring , with a hot spring 's weary mineral taint , which was really the corroded-iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meditating on . Nearly every project Sam undertook was initiated by a hole in the wall . Jenny towel-dried her hair into strings and hid her mirrored nakedness in clothes from the floor  --  leggings , undershirt , sweatshirt , socks , Sam 's bathrobe . She remembered marveling at her ignorance after the little stick turned decisive blue . In the mirror , her tongue had gone to the corners of her mouth , she had tilted her chin this way and that . Her eyelids did seem subtly fattened , the definition of her hipbones blurred . The areolas of her nipples had pinked and swollen . In their stems , openings had appeared , tiny as tear ducts , in a ragged ring . I ca n't believe it : the vertigo of not having known some grand body change was taking place , the sense of being dragged forward in time , not ready , victim of a careening loneliness . <p> From that loneliness , she cast forward . Eventually , her certainty that she was going to die would be this sharp . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is me ! Me ! You have to listen to me ! Her body had recognized its chance and closed around it like some gentle fist . Tick tock , Jenny thought , without happiness , and then , far too fast for any transition , with happiness . She considered her reflection with new regard . It could get pregnant . She had n't known that . She knew herself , irresolute and thirty-six and full of trouble . If she wanted this , if she ever wanted this , now was the time . <p> When Sam said , " Do you want it ? " she countered , " Do you ? " <p> " Jenny  --  Do you ? is the question . " <p> ( What did that mean ? ) ( How much would he help ? ) " Not the only question . " <p> " The first question . " <p> It was clear from their voices , from the possessiveness of her arms around him , from the persuasive tenderness with which he ran a hand down her back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide what she thought , then her chin tipped up because she could n't stand not knowing what he thought  --  but it was already clear , clear what they wanted , what they had learned , that minute , to want . <p> I , I , I went the fairy tale . You 'd been listening ever since you could remember to Now I 'm going to or I changed my mind about or All I really need is , absorbed in each twist and turn of the narrative . I love  --  you did n't know how to begin to perceive I love for what it was . Distrusting I constructions was tantamount to distrusting consciousness . Impossible not to believe the universe  --  sun and moon and stars  --  swung around I love . " I do want it , " in an amazed voice , was meant as an answer , was meant to decide the future . <p> Miscarriage had taught Jenny : I could be so small , could be the magnet for a vast helplessness . This ca n't happen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a freak , not to have known that . She was no longer a fool , a freak , a child . <p> The kitchen was an almost safe place , almost because she was acutely aware of being alone for the night . She set out a cup and saucer . <p> As a child she 'd made a game of passively letting the tears streak where they wanted , slicking her nostril wings , even creeping in , dampening breath , or beading on her upper lip and insinuating themselves into the corners of her mouth until they were a taste , searing fresh salt . Crying 's rhythm had been distinct . It escalated , peaked , fell off , and raggedly revived . it finished in dear-eyed calm , even elation . No more . Crying now is ugly , exacting , bitter through and through , monotonous from the beginning , ending only in exhaustion . Sam said , Unreasonable , he said , Come on , he said , This ca n't be good for you , honey . He said honey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever else she felt , something went sweet , as if a single leaf in an aspen tree flipped over and caught the light . That 's how she keeps herself from crying now . He 's not here to say honey . He ca n't seem to say it on the phone . It could be he needed her face to say honey . <p> Was it a change , did it matter , that she did n't cry , was she further along in the course of grief ? She was aware there were supposed to be stages , but she 'd resisted knowing what they were , or what somebody thought they were . The kettle shrilled . The tea bag bled itself an amber nimbus . Jenny drank , tucking dry cotton feet on a chair rung , newspaper all over the table . <p> WEDDING DRESS , never been used , size 8 petite . $400 . Plus veil . Josie . <p> Nobody tolerated , in a wedding , any whiff of previous failure , did they ? Or could some couple believe their love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The wind was back , shivering the reflection of the kitchen in the big kitchen window , lofting the page of newsprint a hair 's breadth from the table . Sam has said that window needs caulking . <p> FOR SALE , small six-year-old Paint Mare , Pretty , goes English or Western . Asking $500 or best offer . Call Jim evenings . <p> Jenny had learned English , but Western was practical in Rio Arriba County 's gopher-dug fields , wash boarded dirt roads , and eroding badland bluffs . A painter , she liked " paint " used of a horse  --  liked , too , the cheerfulness of errant capitalization , and the confusion over whether the mare 's name was " Pretty " or Jim just thought she was . Evening . This was evening . Getting late . Sam 's calls , from the greenhouse couple 's place , have been late , evasive , as coded and inconsequential as a boyfriend 's . Maybe he became husband too young , so that boyfriend floated out there , a state whose possibilities had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased on ( her friends pretend distress ) when she was twenty . He was twenty-two . She will have to learn girlfriend all over , the light provocativeness , the essential friendliness . This idea makes her feel tired and sad and heavy-handed . <p> She reread the ad 's last line , finding it simple to lose interest . Sam had said , " Borrow a horse , then , " sounding like himself again in his impatience with her . She skipped past cords of pinon , ten-speeds , chain saws , tipis , and automatic baby swings to : <p> FOR SALE , good mountain and pleasure horse , 5 years old , QH type , good disposition and solid dark feet . For an intermediate rider , $700 . Leave message for Rick . <p> Jenny liked this horse for standing so foursquare on his solid dark feet . What she suffered was attraction : Here was such calm . His lip cringed up like a chimpanzee 's , elastic , whiskered ; his teeth closed on her weed bouquet . He jerked at the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braininess between the ears  --  Rocky , his name was . A ten-year-old in a baseball cap had guided Jenny to this field , and was waiting , still straddling his dirt bike , a presence she wished she could ignore , because it was a kind of lie , or at least an act , for her to be here at all . In a fit of blackly descending detachment , she knew she could n't buy the horse . She lacked the energy to return to the trailer and carry on the nice , vague , glancing negotiation with the boy 's father  --  Rick  --  that would have shaved some amount from the seven hundred asked-for dollars . <p> Actually , the boy 's father had n't been alone in the trailer , but with another man , like enough to be his brother or cousin , and they 'd been making breakfast , an entire refrigerator 's profusion emptied onto the kitchen table  --  jars of jalapenos , mayonnaise , and salsa , an onion minced right onto Formica , a carton to which the broken eggshells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar lid gleaming the broken-glass purple of grape jelly . " Can you cook ? " Rick wanted to know . He 'd gestured helplessly with a spatula . This is a mess . <p> " You look like you 're doing fine , " Jenny said . <p> Rick studied her up and down . She supposed she looked tense , standing there in her T-shirt and jeans , hands shoved deep ; m her pockets , a boyish pose , defensive ; in fact , she could n't have said what she was doing there , or how she was going to get out of there , but Rick unexpectedly helped . " If you can find my kid , he can take you out to that horse we 're selling . " <p> Now , " Are n't you going to ride him ? " the boy demanded . He yanked his bike around and pedaled hard to catch her . <p> " I just remembered something , " she said foolishly . <p> " What ? " he cried . " What ? " incredulous as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't watching , the dirt road all ruts and stones , but he jarred along gymnastically . <p> She avoided the trailer stranded on its cinder blocks , but starting her Volkswagen , she had to recognize , through the windshield , the boy 's disappointment . He did n't wave . She had , obscurely , no right to leave . <p> A dusk without rain , but growing steadily colder , kindling by the woodstove but no fire lit , tea in its cup by Jenny 's elbow . The dark-footed gelding finally disappeared from the want ads a week ago . <p> Six-year-old chestnut Quarter Horse mare , nice mover , reliable . $500 . Call evenings . <p> Not sinful , wanting a horse , but inexplicable , in Sam 's view . Or , Sam 's code for the irrational , " Not something we need . " Their road winds down a hill , two dirt streamers with a central mane of parched grass , and where it passes Delgado 's and Salazar 's orchards , it 's so narrow Sam 's truck is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tools . Sam 's gunning of the engine at the foot of the hill is the single familiar sound the night withholds . She knows the phone wo n't ring . It rang last night , and before they got very far , their mutual evasiveness fell through  --  did a gaudy collapse into tension so flagrant she asked , " What do we do now ? " <p> When he said nothing , Jenny caught herself rehearsing an answer for him : We try again , O.K. ? <p> In the space of a held breath , this little inward voice instructed Jenny in her answer to that answer : Oh , I want to , too . <p> Imagine trying , knowing what you knew , trying deliberately , eyes open . <p> " What do we do now ? " was still waiting , and it was what he answered , obliquely . " You 're so angry at me . " <p> She was scared to find herself so alone , and turned on him with consummate scornful patience . " Because you act like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I 'm the only one who has to think about it . I dream about it , did you know that ? I dream about you not getting there . " <p> " Jenny . This is n't the time . I ca n't go into it . " <p> " Of course you ca n't . " <p> She 'd meant to hurt . Another wary , hidden-from-her exhalation . He smoked more when he was away , and kept the clothes in his duffel neater than in his drawers in their bedroom dresser , and bought lottery tickets . He told her he was tired and when she said she knew that , he said he was too tired to come home . <p> Six-year-old Thoroughbred mare , race winner at Santa Fe Downs last spring . $400 . Call Mack . <p> The cost of Josie 's wedding gown plus veil , and " Thoroughbred " functions as a one-word seduction . You 're not thinking , Jenny told herself . Not using your head . Sam 's stress on using . Anyone could own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had warned that they should not rush themselves , but give each other time . Boxed , wrapped , ribboned , to be exchanged like anniversary gifts , or did Dr. Chavez mean time was an element they were to share , like the oxygen you both breathed when you lived in the same house , like a bed ? The cup rang in its saucer . She could n't guess how destructive last night was . The injury 's dimensions were shadowy because it had occurred in Sam . <p> The morning after they became lovers , Sam broke two fingers in touch football with his housemates , and because she 'd been sitting on the sidelines , barely awake but on the verge of disenchantment , anyway  --  he 'd seemed the silliest , the least familiar , of seven boys  --  her morning-after doubt abandoned her . She had to drive him to the hospital : he was hers . They waited out red lights with held breath . The doctor told Jenny , " Here 's what 's going on with your boyfriend . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  to be shown his x-rays ? Nobody had thought she should be uneasy , seeing inside , seeing irremediably deep , seeing slender bones . He said , " What 's come over you ? " when they made love that night . <p> He said " What is it ? " so tenderly . What had come over her was fear . He was real to her , and she was n't real to him yet . <p> He would say that the skittishness with which the mare observed this stranger , Jenny , was proof of the continual high-strung singing of the nerves that wrecks Thoroughbreds . The mare 's owner , end of a blond braid showing under her riding helmet , coaxed the mare 's nose into the bridle cat's-cradled between her hands , then let the reins drop to the mare 's withers , which flinched , even that lightly struck . <p> " I should warn you , " the woman , Lindsay , said . Mack did n't exist ; Lindsay had n't wanted any crazies on the phone . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rested a palm judgingly on the mare 's chest . " Feel . " <p> The slickness was like a wet dog 's , muscled , hot , holding a potent faraway heartbeat . Sweat stung a paper cut . Jenny sucked the finger and heard herself : " I have n't been on a horse in so long . " <p> " Really ? Is the Bad Girl who you want to start with ? " <p> " Bad girl ? " <p> " Cortez 's Shining Daughter , her papers say . Shiny Little Bitch when I ca n't catch her . The Bad Girl . " <p> " She 's beautiful . " <p> " That 's the thing . " Lindsay was bumped a step forward , butted from behind . " Horse for ' Can we please rock-and-roll ? ' " <p> Jenny recollected then that people who hung around horses a lot liked making up dialogue for them . " Why are you selling her ? " This was n't rude , Jenny figured , not given this coyote-fenced paddock , the lap pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saltbox ?  --  beyond that . She had parked her VW beside a baking black Mercedes , and felt fraudulent . <p> Lindsay said to the horse , " Me kiss you goodbye ? Can that , can that happen ? Is it really a question ? " <p> Jenny assumed the last question meant her . " If you want it to be , " Jenny said . " I like her . " <p> " You 're still on the ground . " <p> Jenny , given a leg up , hoped this mocking , pitiless person could n't tell how unsure her seat was . Her hands transmitted an unfamiliar tension , at which the mare 's ears flattened . " Anh-anh-anh , " Lindsay chided , handing up the black velvet helmet , still warm from her head , a secure fit , Jenny 's jaw daintily underlined by the strap . Jenny dug her heels in harder than she meant to , and the mare startled into a canter , ears clicking forward to frame a movie of the ground , sage and junipers reeling past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly panic rising , The mare perceived mistrust , which was incorporated into her canter as an imprecision , the not-entirely innocent threat that she 'd put a foot wrong . Jenny relaxed hands and knees , faking a confidence the mare bought . Her canter settled , the field was crossed , space flung itself out and grandly outward , as if in reaction to them  --  space set off like rings radiating from a skipped stone  --  like fast , serial touches of stone across water , and Jenny , remembering it completely as she felt it again , had the sweetly fearless sensation of loving speed . The fence rose before them , the mare cornered neatly , and a magpie flared from a juniper . The mare jarred sideways , dodging the bird and then dodging from haywire momentum , and Jenny was seized by a long , weightlessly pure moment of grief . <p> Her shoulder smashed first and she rolled , fearing hooves , hoofbeats concussing the ground she was sliding across , her forearm in front of her face , knees and elbows grinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a prickly pear , before stony gravity fixated on her , before the silently dilating , slowly steadying earth let her lie there . A line of ants wound past her nose in huge close-up , bearing a butterfly wing , a backlit yellow shard carried along , scarcely trembling . The ants that followed carried the butterfly 's antennaed head . Jenny sat up , holding her wrist , trying her fingers . <p> In her bathroom , Lindsay doled out Tylenol before concentrating on the arm jenny extended . <p> " I 'm a coward , " Jenny said . <p> The thorns were as wickedly elusive as fish bones , translucent but , unlike fish bones , rigid , bristling . Lindsay said tensely , miserably , " Ow , " each time she nicked one free . " What 's this ? " Tweezer tips indicated linked hives . <p> " Red ants . " <p> " For somebody who did n't get hurt , you got hurt . " <p> " Do you think it needs a doctor ? " Jenny asked , a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisingly practical face . <p> " I can do this . " <p> " O.K. " <p> " If you trust me to . " <p> Like all people who ask you to trust them , she was a little offended . " O.K. " <p> " Bear with me . Ow . Can you hold any stiller ? " <p> Relief washed through Jenny , seated on the john with nothing more to do . All around them , Mexican tiles sported small blue birds , naively painted , their wings spread wide . Jenny began painting birds . Jenny dashed off wings , curved breasts , swallows ' tails in rapid dozens ; she lived in a sunstruck Mexican village and she made her living painting exactly the same bird again and again and she was never coming back : it was too nice knowing just what would happen next . <p> " Done . Now for your face . " Lindsay lifted Jenny 's chin , Jenny shutting her eyes against the painful glare that was the skylight . Lindsay washed Jenny 's face so gently that Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of tenderness , as only an adult can be shaken . <p> In her kitchen , Lindsay poured Scotch into tumblers . " Cliche , " she said . <p> " Cliche ? " <p> " Doctor 's wife drinks away the lonely afternoon . That was your first ride in how long ? " <p> " I do n't really drink , " Jenny said . " Years . I 'm on her back two minutes , maybe . " <p> " You fell well , you know . Not everybody can , not even good riders . Do you remember Jackie Kennedy calling Jack in a rage because paparazzi caught her landing on her rear ? He says , ' Honey , if the First Lady falls on her ass , it 's news . ' He was what none of them are now  --  funny . " <p> " I loved him . " <p> " God , I loved him . " <p> " I cried . " <p> " God , I cried . " <p> " Then we find out about Marilyn Monroe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig . Well , " Lindsay said , " to news , " and they chinked glasses . <p> " You 're not telling me to go out there and get right back on . " <p> " Nope . I 'm for getting back on when you want to . " <p> Lindsay poured again , talking  --  the worst tricks Cortie had played on her ; other , truly vicious horses she 'd known ; falls she 'd seen . " It 's a lot to ask . " Lindsay brooded over Scotch barely paled by Perrier . " You 're all right , and she 's all right . " <p> Jenny grew increasingly dreamy in Lindsay 's gleaming , finished kitchen . No holes in the walls anywhere in this house . Maybe this was what Sam got from being away . The details of other people 's lives were a distraction surprisingly intense , as if you 'd secretly believed your own depression had starved everyone else of vitality . Here was Lindsay , saying , " A bite , " scratching at a shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond strands that wavered , buoyed by static electricity , from her loosening braid , and past her shoulder the dishtowel hanging from the oven door , a shadow replicating each fold , farther , infinitesimally scaled shadows cast by each pane in the waffled cloth , like the tranquil iteration of cells across a honeycomb , the compounding of facets in a butterfly 's eye , cratering of rain in a stream , the transcendent perfectionism of the world , which Jenny had trusted , which had , in her body , miscarried . <p> " You have kids ? " <p> " Two of my own  --  ours  --  plus one from Kenny 's first marriage who lives with us . You ? " <p> " We want one , " Jenny said . " I think we want one . " <p> The ambiguity attracted Lindsay . She leaned forward over her own crossed arms . Jenny had found that her friendships with women often began this way , with an ambiguity threaded into small talk . If the ambiguity was taken up , then something would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , gain in seriousness . Between women , a neglected ambiguity was a rebuff . Between men , it was a courtesy . Therefore , when you set a man and a woman talking together  --  <p> Lindsay touched Jenny 's wrist to ask , " Does it still hurt ? " <p>  --  you laid the groundwork for disappointment  --  <p> " Hurt much , I mean ? " <p>  --  incomprehension , recrimination  --  <p> Jenny interrupted her own slightly woozy line of thought . " No . Yes . Not really . You were so patient . I ca n't thank you . " She remembered she was supposed to add enough . " I ca n't thank you enough . " <p> " For a minute I was afraid we 'd have to call my husband . " <p> " He 's a doctor ? " <p> " The worst , an O.B. , gone all the time , and when he 's here , he thinks I should be like a patient and adore him .

" You do . You know him . He 's your doctor . " <p> " He 's my doctor , " Jenny said with a lilt . <p> " Well  --  what does he say , about your wanting a baby ? He likes to tell women your age  --  you 're thirty-five ?  --  to get with the program . He can be crude . " <p> " He said wait before trying again . He was kind . I had a miscarriage at five months . " <p> " I 'm sorry , I 'm so  --  " Lindsay shook her head . " Such a  --  " <p> " It 's all right . It is . It was seven  --  it was eight weeks ago .

I want to , too . " You 're right . " <p> To the hospital : Jenny , wearing the paint-graffitied sweatshirt and torn jeans she cleaned house in , had tugged her cowboy boots on over dirty bare feet to go out . In the Pojoaque 7-Eleven , she bought Windex and the newspaper and a Hershey 's bar she ate two bites of before clicking off Van Morrison so she could concentrate on the interval of disbelief that followed the first pain , and then  --  oh , fear took her over , and she let it , because she thought fear might know what to do . One downward-dragging menstrual rush followed another , and Jenny thought , I can drive , it 's fastest , but she could n't imagine walking to EMERGENCY , which was red letters through falling rain . She let the wipers sweep their half-moons and the engine idle and the headlights keep pouring into the rain until somebody knocked at her window  --  an orderly , still in his hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He helped her . Dr. Chavez had been in the hospital , making rounds . Alone at last , Jenny found the hostile room nearly dark . Her miscarriage had absorbed the light , like a day 's work . They had given her something ( a lot of things ) . She curled up , bare feet and gown and sheets and pillowcases quite clean , curling into herself , into the plush cozening of the drugs . During the night , a slit widened into a doorway , in which her doctor , like a half-dreamed , half-seen father come home late , stood studying her . " You 're awake . Good . I 'll get Sam . " <p> Sam , illumination from the hallways allowing her to piece together , in quick , slanting takes , the angles and shadows of his face . She was sure she was incoherent , but he answered , " Jenny , you ca n't believe that . " <p> " I did n't want him enough . Not enough . " <p> " Sweetie , sweetheart , shit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad thing that happened . " <p> " I did n't love him . Not all the time . Not enough . " <p> " You loved him . Let 's not do this so late at night . Let 's really not . Go back to sleep . I 'll hold you , all right ? I 'll hold you , but you need to shhhhhhhh . Shhhhhhhh . " <p> Dr. Chavez had said the next morning , " We hope we do n't get this situation . We like to determine a cause , because that 's better all round , so I 'm sorry . As far as I know , there 's nothing wrong with Jenny , and there was nothing wrong with the baby . That we could find . " He 'd stopped , anticipating Sam 's anger . <p> " We do n't get to know why , and you ca n't rule out the same thing happening again . " <p> " I 'm afraid that 's the shape of it . But chances are very  --  " <p> He 'd gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less circumspect , from urgent kindness , than the doctor in this morning 's conference , had told Jenny the night before that the baby was a boy . <p> " I 've got to go , " Jenny said . <p> " Oh , I think you need coffee . " Lindsay set the kettle on the burner . Jenny knew from magazine ads that the kettle was in a design museum somewhere . Even in her sweaty , horsy T-shirt , Lindsay was fresh , together , somehow visibly rich . Envy , Jenny told herself , that 's ugly . Considering Lindsay 's concern it seemed a new low point . Lindsay poured coffee into glass mugs transparent even to their handles . " Cream ? " <p> " Yes . Thanks . " Cream rolled through the soft explosions of time-lapse roses . <p> " Know why I 'm selling her ? " <p> " Selling her . Liar . " <p> " Kenny expects to happen to me what happened to you , only more serious . He claims it distracts him . Some days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me lying in the field hurt , when his mind has to be on what he 's doing . " <p> " There 's nobody very nearby if you did get hurt . " <p> " I can tell him I tried to get rid of her . That might help calm him down . Listen , you do n't have to be looking for a horse to come back . " <p> " I 'd like to . " Jenny stood , waiting for her head to clear , and was led through a living room done in Saltillo tile and teak and taupe leather couches . The walls were Rothenberg , T. C. Cannon , a sullen Scholder , the front doors massive and carved , long ago stolen from somewhere . <p> Lindsay said , " Will you call ? " <p> " Or you can . " <p> " You 're in the book ? Your last name 's  --  ? " <p> " Small . " <p> Lindsay said , " You 're a painter . " <p> " Right . " Jenny was confused : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . <p> Lindsay dragged her back through the room , past a grand piano crowned by a vase of calla lilies . How to get your money 's worth out of lilies : have them twice , once real , once reflected in the oil slick of a grand piano 's lid , Jenny thought , before she was aimed at a wall where there hung a small drawing she 'd done two years ago  --  the bedroom window , the Taos blue of its shutters barely figuring in the composition , which was mostly soft umbers and burnt sienna . The window was open a few inches . You could see , though not far , into the dim interior , the wide planks of the floor , the corner of a bed , the crosshatching that was a nine-patch quilt , and , scarcely there , merest suggestion , the intertwined legs of a couple . <p> Lindsay said , " It 's a tiny daydream , not a drawing . It happens in my head . " <p> " My dealer did n't want it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't ask to who . I missed it . " <p> " Why I bought it  --  this sounds silly  --  was because I could cover it with my hand . Make it go away , make it come back , with my hand , and it kept being beautiful . " Lindsay paused . " Do you want to borrow it ? You said you missed it . " <p> " No . I 'm just glad to see it again . " <p> At Lindsay 's front door , they said , " Well  --  " <p> " Well  --  " <p> They parted awkwardly , new friends . <p> Sam came home that night , tense and formal , ready to be patient with her , but it happened that both of them desired an evening without confrontation . It was n't as strange as it should have been , by any rational scale , to lie aimlessly talking to him again in bed . It had n't felt as strange as it should have to make love . Their attraction to each other had often enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question it . <p> She said , " I sold a painting . " The message had been on her machine . <p> " Which ? " <p> " The pale green apples on the windowsill with our hill in the background . " <p> " But that 's huge . " Sam often thought of her work in terms of size  --  of money , really . <p> " To a couple from Fort Worth , Callie said , who have lots of brand-new bare walls . " <p> " Walls needing paintings ? " <p> " They like me , Callie says . " <p> " People from Fort Worth like you . Rich rich people like you . " <p> " Uh-huh . Oh , you have to talk to the Delgados . They do n't like me . They like you . " <p> " Well , I 'm more easy-going . " <p> She said , " Will you ? " <p> " I already did . I passed Juan on the road . I said that arroyo keeps flooding . He said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm from the sheets , and would have run his thumb deftly down the line of rash if she had n't jerked away . She said , " You have to fix those stairs . " <p> The wooden stairs down the slope to her studio , she meant . He had often wondered if those stairs were all right . Prickly pear grew close against them , and it was a believable scenario . He said , " Jesus . Meanwhile , can you be careful ? " <p> She did n't tell Sam she was looking for a horse , and he was gone in the morning before she was awake enough to be vulnerable to questions . She got kissed , and smelled coffee , and woke again an hour later alone . Leaning to pick his shirt up from the floor , Jenny felt generous and capricious and consumed by curiosity about what would happen next : in love . " We need to talk , " she told his shirt . When she held it to her nose , there was a carpenter 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny in her nightgown , two a.m. , read of Chevy pickups , wicker love seats , roof shingles , CD players , sets of encyclopedias and outgrown skis ; well drilling , bail bonding , marriage licensing , engine rebuilding ; guitars , violins , banjos , and mandolins adrift in the Chagall-like night sky that was the true backdrop of want ads everywhere ; vacant spaces for trailer homes with complete service hookups ; Sikhs to guard warehouses ; child care in my home , Christian atmosphere ; Navajo rugs restored to their original beauty . <p> GREEN broke quarterhorse colt , $550 unfinished , $650 finished . Also kid 's pony , make offer . <p> HORSES : one chestnut gelding , $750 . One black filly , halter broke , $200 , or deal on the pair . Call Larry after 5 or all day weekends . <p> What was Sam thinking ? It 's been two days since their night , and he has n't called . When she gets in from the studio , PLAYBACK yields a dozen voices , none of them his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could identify every sound the night offered , though she 'd washed every dish in this kitchen a thousand times , this was the disorientation of crushed expectations . She cupped her tea 's heat between her palms , drank , and found : <p> PUREBRED , registered Arabian gelding , broke , kid gentle , $800 cheap . <p> " ' Kid gentle ' means ? " Jenny asked the man , early Saturday , and he had a shy , maybe hungover unkemptness , unshaven . The black hair , combed straight back , still wet from the shower , was a little embarrassing , as if she were seeing him at the wrong time or in a too-intimate way , as only a girlfriend should . She caught herself thinking girlfriend , not wife . He was the kind of handsome Jenny qualified privately as almost too . <p> " What it sounds like . " He hoisted his four-year-old , and the boy , in his loftiness , touched the horse 's nose . His fingers got snorted on , and he giggled . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip fluttering accommodatingly upward , then reached for its ear and worked it like a lever . " Jase , you let go now , " the man , Carlos , said . " I think you proved my point . " To Jenny he said , " You want to ride him ? " <p> " I 'd like to . " <p> " Can you keep my kid from getting stepped on a minute , and I get the saddle ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> Jenny sat cross-legged , sun very warm on her back . The little boy took a slice of sugar toast from the plank in the fence where he 'd left it balanced . " Let me see , " Jenny said , and shook an ant from it , and a brief rain of sugar . " You know that was a red ant , do n't you ? " she said . " Look . They got me . " He considered her garish arm , fascinated , then turned his toast over and over before taking a bite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , level fields running down to a wash brimming with spring cottonwoods , that green , the mesa opposite the red of cayenne pepper , and the boy said , " He 's my mom 's horse . " <p> " Oh ? Your mom 's ? " <p> " She wants to live in Albkirky with no room for a horse . We do n't know if we go with her or not . " <p> " Hey , are you telling all our secrets ? " The father ruffled the boy 's hair , leaning slightly , balancing the saddle against his side . " Are you going to be just like I am with pretty women ? " <p> Jenny laughed . The child , confused , serious , laughed . When she was in the saddle , Carlos measured the stirrup leather against Jenny 's extended leg , and though she wished she did n't , she liked that . Carlos kept a hand on her knee , pointing . " You can go as far as you want down that dirt road , see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the neighbors wo n't mind if you get a little past it . He ca n't get lost . " <p> " What a good quality . " She thought he should probably take his hand off her knee now , and he did . <p> " This is a good horse I 'm selling you . " <p> " What 's his name ? " <p> " We never named him . Had him how long ? , and never did . It seems funny now , but he was just ' the horse . ' It 's not like we had twenty . I can make one up for you if you want . " <p> " No , thanks . " <p> The horse had a smart canter , chin down , ears pricked . His style was unassuming and mindful . She gave him a little more leg . His new speed , matched by a fractional gain in interest , was just as judicious . He 'd be unlikely to put a foot down one of the gopher holes in the bluffs behind Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jenny was under no illusion that the gelding experienced anything like the improbable affection she felt for him  --  why should he ?  --  but he had sweet manners , willingness , quick wits . <p> " Can I have some time to watch him ? " Jenny asked , when she got back , and Carlos grinned , though this time the grin was a shade conscious in its appeal , before saying , " Buy him . Then you get a lot of time to watch him , " taking his son by the hand , and leaving her there . Jenny rested against the fence , following the horse 's methodical grazing , the muscled slant of his shoulder , the way he put his nose into the grass and nudged once , twice , so that the small bees were driven out . <p> " Yes , " she said at their back porch . She got high-fives from father and son alike , and sat beside them on the steps to write out the check . <p> Carlos leaned back on his elbows , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tack , " Carlos said , " and my feeding him until you come for him , I throw that in for free . He trailers real nice . " <p> " I wonder , " Jenny said . <p> This attracted a slantwise doubtfulness ; Carlos thought she could have changed her mind . " Un-hunh ? " <p> " Can I keep him here ? " <p> " Here ? " Impolite to ask , directly , Why ? " It 's a drive for you . " <p> " Twenty minutes . I 'll come a couple of times a week . I mean "  --  the pause was awkwardness  --  " not for long . Until I find a place closer to home for him . " <p> Carlos said , " That 's our field . Nobody 's using it . You can if you want to . " <p> " Really ? " She did n't know how to sound properly grateful  --  enough , not too much , not stupidly but gracefully appreciative . <p> " Sure . Really . He 's happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can work that off him . Want some coffee ? " <p> She raked strands of her hair from the corners of her mouth , where the wind had blown them , as it was blowing Carlos 's drying hair , as it was blowing around his son 's . She wanted a cup of coffee , a kiss , a life she knew inside and out  --  wanted , with an absurd passion , this man , this child , this place . Who would she be if she let that show , if she went inside , if she had a cup of coffee ? <p> " No , " Jenny said , " I think I 'd better go , " and she and Carlos shook hands : <p> That night , unerringly , Sam came home . He sat across from her , the table between them lit by a citronella candle . She supposed that if they ever came to an agreed-on break  --  separation , divorce  --  Sam would cook for that occasion , too , and they would discuss it like friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table into the middle of the imaginary portal . Beneath their bare feet , warm , turned earth . Stars were out . <p> " So you went ahead and did it . " He did n't want to sound so angry . He was too far in the wrong to carry such anger off . <p> " It was my money . " <p> " It 's not only money . " The half-coyote mongrel of their neighbors across the arroyo , the Quintanas , leaped the footer , sat and whined , and Sam tossed him the skin of his grilled chicken breast , gone in a snap , and then a heel of French bread the dog trotted off with . <p> " We 'll have ten dogs here . " <p> " Naw , he can keep a secret . " Sam poured more wine . " I do n't want you keeping the horse that far away . " <p> " Oh , you do n't want me . " <p> " You 'd be gone all the time . It would turn into something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did that turn into ? " <p> " It turned into me right here . Honey , I 'm home . " He could do this , go from antagonistic to charming , skipping conciliatory altogether . She still expected the concessions she would have made , in his place  --  the strategies to disarm , to rationalize . <p> She said abruptly , " How sad were you , Sam ? " <p> " You really want to talk about it ? " <p> " That 's just one question . " <p> " And if I was n't as sad as you , I lose you ? " <p> " If I do n't know you anymore , do you have me ? " <p> " All right . How sad was I. " His voice was absolutely careful . " I thought , before this happened , that we would always be fine . I did n't know you could be in pain and I would n't even know  --  that I 'd only get to you hours later . I never believed in my mind we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was living as if we could n't be touched . " <p> " Other things have happened . " She did n't want to say , But that 's what I felt , because it would stop him . <p> " Not like this . It was finding out I 'm not the person who can protect you . I do n't know if I thought about the baby as much as I thought about you . Maybe I ca n't take care of anything , I do n't know . I do n't know what we do , I do n't know what comes next , and you  --  that 's what you want to ask me , is n't it ? ' What do we do now ? ' " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Maybe we do n't plan . Maybe we just see . " <p> And did he mean a baby , or did he mean see what things were like between them ? It was their usual accord , spoken only to a certain point , trusted  --  she feared  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their days apart , they went to bed together , and before long she knew she was pregnant . She waited to take the test , she waited to tell him  --  waited , spending the long afternoons riding , or in Quintana 's two-stall shed , long unused , where the gelding was kept , for now . Under the corrugated-tin roof , the straw-fragrant heat formed a room of its own , stifling , luxurious . Dust fumed from the chestnut flank . The curry comb scoured in circles , the brush followed the grain of the hair . The hoofpick flaked chips of gravel from the massive , upturned bowl of bone weighting her knee , her thigh , her entire side . She rested a palm against his neck  --  like satin flushed from within by a sunlamp . His neck quaked when flies landed , his head lifted and was shaken irritably , the large eye vulnerable , lashed in languid flies . She swept her hand across it , making the eye blink and flies shoo . She did n't know if anything was changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more remote  --  affection , but she was sure kindness had to be gestural here , consistent , patiently repeated . <p> One morning , later than usual , she shoved the gate open to find the Delgados ' smallest boy under the horse , playing with Star Wars figures in a cave , in shade a glint with motes of straw , anchored at its four corners by immobile hooves . The horse flirted its ears nervously at Jenny , who said softly , " You 're doing great . You 're doing fine , " and bent until the boy granted her his attention . His upward gaze had the uncomprehending felicity of a child getting away with something dangerous . She told him to come out slowly , and he came in a sneakered half-crouch , the crown of his head brushing the horse 's belly but not distracting the horse from his deliberate , delicate motionlessness . <p> Jenny caught the boy 's wrist and knelt down . Facing her , he got scared at last and clasped her neck , leaning into her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What could have happened withered and grew incredible and blew away , leaving them alone , her arms around him , and his arms around her . <p> <p> By ELIZABETH TALLENT <p> ELIZABETH TALLENT divides her time between Little River and Davis , California , and teaches at he University of California , Davis . the author of two collections of stories , Time with Children and In Constant Flight , and a novel , Museum Pieces , her work has appeared in The New Yorker , Esquire , Grand Street , The Paris Review , and elsewhere .
