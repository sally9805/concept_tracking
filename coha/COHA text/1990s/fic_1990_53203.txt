In the mornings I get to the mall before anyone else , even the other shop owners . They have n't got the music on yet , and all I can hear as I set up is the plish-plosh of the fountain . Without any flowers covering my cart , you can notice the builder 's skill  --  wooden pegs at the joints , not nails , the solid oak body I stained and polyurethaned myself . Fifteen hundred , unfinished , it cost me . Next year I 'll get another cart , put it at the other end of the causeway , and hire someone else . <p> My hunch was right  --  if there 's one thing people will buy , again and again , it 's flowers . I 'm already establishing a regular clientele , just as a restaurant owner might , though I do n't even need anything like a cook , waitresses . The flowers sell themselves . I say , " Here , smell that , " and hold a rosebud up to a young lover 's nose . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins hearts for sure . Guaranteed . " Then he buys a dozen , and I 'm twenty bucks ahead of the game . When someone buys a set of encyclopedias from you , you 've got to move on  --  that 's what I was up against at Great Books . They wo n't be buying another set from you the next week , or the next year , or probably in their lifetime . It 's a one-shot deal . But flowers die . And people always want more . <p> Now , if Al had pulled that trigger , if he had channeled all his anguish and hatred to that one small muscle action , I would n't be here today . I think back on it now and it does n't even seem a part of my own history ; it 's more like the memory of a film watched late at night with Johnny Walker Black for company . <p> How could it have gotten out of control ? I ask myself . When things are so stable and smooth and everything is rolling along at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to fathom the rough times . So , when the phone rang the other night , and there was Linda 's voice chatting about her life now , asking how things were going with me , my business , all I wanted to do was hang up , keep it all behind me . But if there 's one thing I can always talk about , it 's my work , and I started telling her how well things were going , about my plans for expansion . And then , for some reason , I ended up asking about Al , whether she 'd heard from him , just as if nothing had ever happened , as if he were still her husband , my boss , and a friend . She said when Al was back in town on business he called her , was sweet as pie ; then he asked about me : he wanted to know if she still had her rigger . <p> Big Bad Al , we called him at Great Books of the Western World . " Alberto Bernardo Salerno , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on or off at will . We were managers of neighboring territories when we first met , had both gone from working one route to overlooking five . We did it the hard way , too , by being the best and pushing ; because even if you sell more than anyone else out there  --  which happened plenty for both of us  --  you 'll stay right where you are . You 've got to talk with the man up top , let everyone who knows anyone know you want to move . Otherwise , they leave you stranded , because having people at the lowest levels who can sell is , in a way , the most important part . <p> But Al got the call from upstairs , not me . And he told me point-blank , " Ai n't no smart-ass boy like you ever gon na move up without a lot of help . " So when he was promoted to VP of the upstate New York region , he gave me a shot at district manager of sales . " Jimmy , I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll move with me every step of the way because you 're one of the best there is . It 's as simple as that . You could sell the Pope a salami on Friday . " And I like to think he was right , that selling has been my one special talent in this life , one thing that at least has remained consistent , stable . <p> There 's a saying of Al 's I remember every day as I string the flowers onto my cart , stack bouquets all around me , unfold the wooden sign that points people in my direction . It goes : you con your friends and I 'll con mine , but let 's not con each other . Then I might chuckle to myself if I remember the variation he 'd tell after a few Scotches : you can pick your friends and you can pick your nose , but you ca n't pick your friend 's nose . I guess I think about these words so much because I know it 's all a con game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me conning you , conning me , conning someone else , ad infinitum . <p> But Al was wrong about the not-conning-each-other part because we 're all of us always conning each other , no matter what ; or maybe that 's why it was so imperative for him to say the words on such a regular basis , maybe he knew , as I know now , the way things really are . And maybe that 's where the nose-pickng fits in , too , because there 's always some one thing that you 'll never do or say , even with the closest of friends ; there 's always that part of yourself you keep hidden . And that 's all part of the con . <p> I met Al 's family for the first time just before we flew out to Iowa , of all places , for a conference on the newest line of encyclopedias and other typical management training BS you ca n't possibly learn by sitting around a table talking ; but what the hell , they pay you for it . He wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like the idea of his wife driving out to the airport through rush-hour traffic . He said he could imagine her running herself and his boy into a telephone pole on the turnpike . " Jesus Christ , then where would I be ? " he said , and I knew just what he meant . I knew all too well what it was like to suffer and lose  --  had felt firsthand what he only imagined over Scotches , down at Sandy 's , our hangout . So when he told me in vivid detail how a killer might break into his house when he was gone and in one small moment wipe out all he had , it bothered me  --  it was one of the only things Al ever said before that day that bothered me ; because he possessed a family , he had what I only once had the promise of , and then only briefly . Yet all he could do was talk about losing it , about trees falling in on his house , about freak accidents and crimes that happen to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got my kid , but he is n't even mine . He 's my mother 's as much as I was my mother 's . When I look at him , when I go back into the house I grew up in , I do n't see my son , but only me some thirty-five years ago , taking all the love and discipline my mother could muster , living in the belief that there 's not a whole hell of a lot beyond that pea-green shingled house in Albany , New York , that will ever bother me , that will ever mean so much to me as her hot meals and perfume the scent of lavender . <p> Al said , " You ever love a woman , a child , so much that you can feel it surging right through your whole body when you stop to think about it ? I mean , almost like sticking your finger in a light socket . " We were drinking steadily in the dimness of Sandy 's ; outside the sun was bright as knives . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well , " I said.Al <p> " So what happened ? " Al said . <p> " She died , " I said . It was a lie , of sorts . In my mind she no longer existed . She was just another part of me that had gone by , was so far removed as to no longer have much relevance . So , she , Amalia , was dead . That was the only time I told him . I never even told him about the boy , Reg . <p> " Shit , " he said , bowing his head , tapping his empty glass against the thickly coated wooden tables . " Shit , that sucks . That really sucks , " he said , and I thought he was going to cry . <p> What was so ironic , of course , is Al could never figure that rather than some natural disaster , or crazed killer , or sordid twist of fate robbing him of his family , he himself would bring the whole thing down . And then he 'd try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " his best friend in the whole world , " someone who had as little to do with it all as the fucking Shah of Iran , but who just happened to be on the scene and was trying to do what any man should do . I guess that was Al 's problem as much as anything  --  he could never quite figure what he was supposed to do , right up to that day , Linda 's sister sobbing louder and louder , his goddamned ivory-handled pistol reflecting the overhead light like a bundle of pure energy in his hand . <p> I cleared eight hundred bucks the other day  --  can you imagine , eight hundred clams  --  just standing in a mall , letting buyers come to me , then turning on the juice . When you work a territory there 's always that one thing against you , that one big strike : you 're the intruder , the stranger , tap-tapping at the door when no one usually does . You 're the man who people peer out at by turning one corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight through unknown doorways , hallways , to your insistent knocks . So when they swing the door partway open and give you that inquisitive stare , you first have to wade through all that fear and anxiety and unknowing . You have to put them at ease , as they might tell you at a conference table , though it 's so much more than that : you have to convince them that you 're not a stranger , not a part of the unknown , that you 're as welcome a sight as their long lost son would be . ' Cause when it comes right down to it , it does n't matter squat what you 're tugging around in your samples case ; what matters is that they accept you . <p> Now , they 're the ones who feel ill at ease , who are intruders on my abode , my space . And how much easier to play off that kind of emotion ! When they realize they 've wandered into the territory of a friend , of someone who will give them what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do but buy ? And boy do they buy . The roses go the fastest , long-stemmers . Then there are the corsages and carnations ; they 're always hot . I ca n't even tell you how many yellow lily arrangements I 've pinned onto women 's blouses  --  their men too shy to do the honors . Though , in the end , I think they like seeing me come out from the confines of my cart to attach a thing of beauty , for them , on the women they love . It shows that even after the sale I 'm willing to sustain the moment ; they buy more than just a flower , they buy the presentation , too , each and every time  --  that small part of myself that makes everything fall into place .... They 'll be back . <p> I left the car running in the driveway when I went to his house that first time . Their boy came running out to greet me . It was raining , but he was n't wearing a coat . He bolted across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who works with my dad ; are you Jimmy ? " <p> " One in the same , " I said . <p> Al 's wife called from the open door , " Bernie , Bernie , get back in here . What the heck do you think you 're doing ? You 'll get double pneumonia ! " She wore a cotton summer dress . She looked cold . Her fine brown hair was pulled to one side and fell across her shoulder . A floral print apron hung down over her dress . I thought , Here is this little boy 's mother , Al 's wife , and this is their home in the suburbs , and here I am walking across their lawn , her husband 's fellow worker , ready to go away with him on a business trip halfway across the country . The boy looked up at my Afro as if he 'd never seen such a thing before . The rain fell in a light mist on my black pinstripe . A pigeon coo-cooed up under one of Al 's eaves ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his pistol when he got really fed up ) . Linda held out her hand as we went up the steps . <p> After all that 's happened , what I recall most of my short acquaintance ( for lack of a better word with Al 's family of two is that one moment when I walked across his lawn with little Bernie at my side and climbed those steps and held her small , damp hand and introduced myself , then went into their home . It was the most positive time of the whole affair . I think now it was the moment in my life that was most full of possibility . " I 'm Linda , you must be Jim . Al will be ready in a moment , can I get you anything ? " and Al 's voice echoing down the stairway , " Hey , Jimmy , make yourself comfortable , but not too comfortable , " followed by his clucking , loud laugh , Bernie wanting to show me every piece of sports equipment that he owned and trying to get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insistent voice telling him to leave me alone .... It was all but overwhelming . <p> Iowa 's about the dullest place I 've ever been , and people look at black men as if they were something from Mars . We flew in on a DC-8 at midnight and took a cab to the Holiday Inn , where we were told reservations would be waiting for us . They had reservations , but they were under two different names  --  two other guys we worked with . Al told the clerk that if he did n't give us a goddamned room within a half hour that he 'd be spit-shining loafers come morning  --  told him that Brittanica owned Holiday Inn , and that he was VP of the whole region  --  that all it took was one phone call . <p> We waited in the bar . It was on the top floor  --  a large circular room that rotated slowly to give you a three-hundred-and-sixty degree view of the city . One year I 'd won a cruise from the company  --  sold more than anyone ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ; it looked out on nothing but ocean . I could never figure why they boasted that it was six stories high , that you could see for twenty miles , when I had the same view from the porthole of my cabin  --  the blue , white and gray rolling waves that kept me sick for most of the whole damned vacation . And here , again , I had to keep my eyes on the table so my stomach would n't start to flip-flopping . The subtle rotation that made the lights slide by outside was like an ocean swell , and the Dramamine I 'd taken for the flight was wearing off . <p> Before long we were working on our third Scotch , and Al was telling me a joke he 'd told me before . He stopped abruptly and said , " Well now , looks like the Midwest might not be so flat after all . " The waiter was within earshot , and he turned and smiled . Two women had walked into the bar . They each had frizzed-up hair , wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one was a blonde , the other a redhead . " Only one way to tell if redheads are real , you know , " Al said , laughing out loud . I laughed with him and shook my head . I felt like shit , and the Scotch was n't helping any . I could feel the movement of the room coming to me right through the floor . <p> " I also hear that these womens out here really go for big black guys like yourself , " he said . I held my lips shut tight . He was smiling ear to ear . He slurped off the last half of his Scotch . <p> " You 're something , Al really something , " I said . He just kept laughing . It always happened after a few drinks  --  the subtle jibes  --  Al trying to get a rise out of me . With any other man I could imagine wanting to rearrange his face . But even now , after all that 's happened , I remember he never made me angry . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly intrigued by me , by my color and presence . He felt , though he would never admit it , that we were two men of the same ilk . Two men who wanted to make something of themselves and not just sit idly on the sidelines , who were always reaching . He snatched up his empty glass and went over to where the women sat , right next to one of the large windows , drinks with pink-and-red umbrellas in front of them , the world slipping by outside . <p> When the bellboy came in to tell us that they had a room , but that we would have to share  --  it was the best they could do under the circumstances  --  at was still over at their table . I had been watching him closely  --  the way his mouth flashed into a smile at regular intervals , the way he watched the women , carefully , knowingly , eye to eye , the way , though I could n't hear his words , he worked them as he or I might work a customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school  --  or before , standing on someone 's front steps in the pouring rain ( rainy days were the best  --  then , at least , you got in the door ) . I told the bellboy my associate would n't be pleased at all , and he apologized again then gave me the key . <p> It was two in the morning , and though the feeling of exhaustion had already passed over me , I went immediately to our room , to stable ground . But as I stood brushing my teeth in front of the bathroom mirror in my undershorts , Al came bursting in . " Hey , Jimmy , what the hell you doing running out on us like that ? I did n't even know where the goddamned room was . Had to go ask the bellboy . " He stood in front of the bathroom door , his tie undone . I watched him in the mirror , fully clothed , his stomach bulging slightly , pushing out the pattern of his silk shirt , his face olive and red with drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the dim light of a bar . I thought how funny I must look to him , right there next to him in the mirror , the fluorescent light shining off the black of my skin , making my white briefs glow . <p> " Now , listen , Jimmy , I got someone here who 's dyin ' to meet you . " He signaled with his hand and said , " Come on , do n't be shy , now . " The blond woman appeared at the door . I thought we had the same expression when we looked at each other in the mirror . Al said , " Jim , Lois . Lois , Jim . Elaine and I will just be down the hall if you kids need anything . " Elaine said , " C'm on , will you , " from the next room , and Al was gone . <p> From the look on her face you 'd never know that she was slowly undressing in front of me . I thought at any moment she would flinch , rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sprint down the thirteen flights of stairs to some secret corner of the basement . She looked vulnerable and tired , a look that means they 're ready to buy  --  you 've worn them down  --  they just want to get rid of you . <p> " Now you 're not going to accomplish much with those on , " she said as she stepped out of her panties , stood naked on the tile floor . She was looking beyond me , in the mirror now . I pulled off my briefs . She took my hand and led me into the next room . Her face never changed ; it was always there denying every action . I turned off the light and shut my eyes . She let her hair fall on my chest . She touched me behind my testicles . She pushed me into her breasts and held my head between her legs , the only places where I lost the smell of her perfume . When she turned me onto my back and guided me into her , I kissed her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I woke up she was gone . There was just her smell , like strawberries , maybe , all over everything . Al was singing a Sinatra song in the shower . It was almost noon . <p> We both made some good contacts in Des Moines . Al , in fact , was asked by the regional chairman to return later in the month to help him revamp the entire Midwest division . <p> We were in our booth at Sandy 's when he asked me both questions  --  if I could handle being a VP for a month , and if I 'd stop in on Linda and the kid now and then , just to make sure everything was all right . He told me to take them to the lake , to shake the cobwebs out of his boat and do some fishing . " You know , keep her out of trouble , " he said , and winked . That was the last time we 'd ever speak to each other as friends , the last time we 'd sip our drinks and talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the look on some poor new secretary 's face when Al told her the joke about a different kind of dick-tation . Do n't get me wrong . I 'm not getting sentimental or anything . It 's just that I 've never gotten over how one minute things can be a certain way and in the very next everything can come apart . <p> At the bottom of my sign are these words : Flowers are a key to our souls . Look closely . You 'll see what I mean . Notice how the layers of petals overlap , how the stamen stand erect and sticky , probing the air . Notice , too , how they lean toward the light , opening themselves to it . Watch carefully the process of a rose unfolding . You 'll see how it twists upon itself as it opens . Some live long  --  lasting days and days before their leaves wither brown . Others drop their leaves almost immediately after they bloom . I once stayed up all night long determined to see the whole process  --  a grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it seemed as if nothing was happening . Then I noticed a gap where there had n't been one , then another . At one point a petal shot out an eighth of an inch as if a strong wind had caught it . I fell asleep on my hands at the kitchen table , and when I woke up just before dawn the flower was almost fully opened . <p> He left on a Thursday , and I went to his house for the second time ever that Saturday . The boy was in the front yard throwing a tennis ball against the second-story clapboard face , trying to catch it in his bare hands , but the ball took funny bounces , so he was having a rough time of it . I had the top down on my Lincoln . It was a perfect summer day ; the kind of day where you wish you could be a kid again  --  just stand in front of your house knocking a ball off it for hours on end . I was happy to see him out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull up in my big car  --  this strange man of a different color , this friend of his father 's . " Hey , Jim , catch ! " he yelled , and I let the ball hit me right in the chest , pretending to miss . <p> " You trying to kill me , boy , " I said , and he did n't know to laugh until I started laughing myself . <p> Linda was out back pulling weeds from her garden . She was on her knees , a bandanna covering her hair , a portable radio playing classical music on the patch of grass between the two small patches of vegetables . <p> When I said hello , I startled her . I 'd forgotten that you should always speak from a distance and not stand right over someone when you introduce yourself . That 's a trick I learned : if you startle someone , you 'll get the negatives to rolling around in their mind before they 've even heard what you 've got to say . Shout from a distance or wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down the street , curious about who you are and what you could possibly want . But I 'd been off the streets too long , I suppose . Linda brushed off her knees and walked slowly out of the garden to regain her composure . <p> She insisted I stay to dinner that first time . We did a steak on the barbecue . The boy brought me a gallon paint can that had both ends cut out of it and small holes all around the base . He filled it with coals and told me not to pull the can off until they were almost white  --  that 's how his dad did it . We sat at the picnic table and I told them different stories about my life  --  about the time I was Golden Gloves , how I thought I was so good , but once I started getting up into the big leagues I got the crap knocked out of me . I told them that I stuck to fast-pitch softball , that way I would n't end up scarred and unable to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his softball and some gloves out and asked me to show him what a windmill pitch was . He crouched like a catcher up next to a big tree , and even though I took a lot off the thing , I nearly knocked him over . He whipped off his glove and stood there fanning his red hand in the air . I started laughing so hard it did n't seem like I 'd ever be able to stop . It got them to laughing , too ; then they just watched me in amazement . <p> I would get to laughing like that quite a lot with the two of them , a laughter that starts out about one thing but soon deepens and grows , so you do n't even remember what got you started . You think about something that happened long ago , or it 's simply that a moment has arisen where you can let yourself go , where you are happy in a way that for long stretches of time you did n't think was possible . <p> We went to the lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen-foot wooden Lyman with a 75-horse Evinrude , a thick coat of varnish , leather seats . Al bragged about it all the time . I was glad that the lake water was calm , at least , that I would n't need any Dramamine . <p> At the marina a group of men stared at us from the bar patio . They watched as we brought the cooler , our poles and life jackets out onto the dock , undid the canvas cover and got ready to go . They watched us still as we rode slowly out of the small inlet , flipped the engine into reverse to clear the weeds from the blade , then sped away , the bow rising almost straight up into the air before planing off , and it felt like we were hovering a few inches above the water . I remember Linda holding her hair against her face to keep it from getting tangled , Bernie hollering something I could n't hear , all the white men sipping their beers , wondering what the hell I was doing with Al 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , in the evenings , and on the weekends . Bernie would fish a jointed Rapala , twitching it on the surface the way his dad had taught him so it looked like a near-dead fish . I 'd been fishing with Al once in the Adirondacks . We skipped out of some training classes because he 'd heard such good things about the fishing up there . His technique was perfect . He could land the lure right next to a lily pad where , moments before , a largemouth had slurped up his prey , and he 'd twitch the thing , then let it lay still , then twitch it some more , knowing instinctively that a big daddy bass was down there watching , and that it took a lot to fool them into thinking the lure was real . And he seemed to know just when they would come plunging through the surface and how long to wait before he hit back ; and then , when he had it hooked , he 'd shout , " Here he comes now . Baby , supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got you now ! " <p> Linda talked a lot about " the old days , " and " what it used to be like , " how they 'd come to the lake every weekend , but that never seemed to happen anymore ; things were changing . She 'd say , " Al 's just not the same , Jim . He ca n't even take his family out fishing anymore . I do n't know why he has to work so hard . It drives me nuts , and you can tell him so for me . We 're doing fine now . Hell , we were doing fine years ago ; we 've got everything we need . What more does he want ? " I tried to explain how it was just the way the job worked , that you could n't let up or you 'd start slipping . I tried to tell her that when you reached a certain point you could finally kick back and no one would touch you  --  until then you had to keep looking over your shoulder , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck blinds near shore and say , " I suppose . " <p> Bernie was always getting bites , always thought he had one on , only to bring in a clump of weeds . " It was there , " he 'd say . " I must have lost it in the weeds . " One time I remember he really did have one , and a big one at that , because I 'd seen the thing come clear out of the water to take the lure . Bernie even started yelling , " Supper 's on the table . " But then his pole went perfectly straight . When he reeled in the slack , everything was gone . I tested his line and sure enough it was rotten ; you could break it just by pulling at it with both hands , and you should n't be able to do that with any weight line . <p> To dock the boat I 'd let Linda steer us in while I stood on the bow with the line in my hand . I 'd shout , " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse , then say , " O.K. , " and she 'd slip it back into neutral as I put one foot on the edge of the dock and pushed back against the boat with the other , until the two forces were equal . <p> But that one time when I shouted , " O.K. , " and stuck my leg out expecting the boat to glide freely into its spot , she could n't get it out of reverse . The boat started slipping backwards , and I was stuck with one foot on the dock , the other feeling the bow drift away behind me . I remember shouting as loud as I could , " Forward then forward ! " and foolishly trying to pull the boat back in by hooking my foot around the steel rail on the bow-top , my arms wrapped around a post . I remember not wanting to let myself fall into the murky water at any cost , and so I hung on , and felt the two bones pulling apart , the ligaments stretching like rubber bands . Linda says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . I remember so clearly watching the boat ram right into the dock , gouging the carefully varnished finish , throwing me forward , how Bernie leapt out and ran to me , and Linda came right up over the bow . She said my whole leg was turned around so the foot was facing the wrong way , that she 'd never seen anything like it . She thought they 'd find me in two pieces . <p> It did n't start hurting until they got me to the car . At the hospital they put me in a removable cast , gave me pain killers , and said that all they could do was wait and see what the ligaments looked like in a few weeks , and if they were n't healing , they 'd have to operate . The pain got worse and worse even with the pills . Linda insisted I stay at their house that night . <p> I do my own arrangements now . When I first started I 'd buy them all prearranged , looking just like the photographs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and they cost half as much if you buy the individual components . I 'll start with one random flower or piece of greenery . I punch it into the foam , and from there it 's a building process . I look at the piece carefully , from all angles  --  above , below , from the sides . I wait until I envision just what it needs . I add that , and it needs something else . I ca n't let myself think too long or hard about it  --  it just has to come to me , within a few minutes , When things stop coming to me , the process is complete . <p> I was n't able to sleep . If I kept the leg perfectly still , I did n't feel anything , but the slightest motion caused the pain to grab me by the throat . I could hear Linda walking around downstairs after Bernie had gone to bed . This must be what Al hears if he goes to bed before her , I thought  --  the clanging pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Doing what ? Pouring herself a drink ? Watching television ? I remembered Al 's face when the thought of loss crossed his brow , how all the inner power and force that usually jumped right off his skin had vanished . But then I thought about her eyes  --  the color of my skin , darker even  --  and the way she 'd looked at me when she eased me into bed , helped me get into Al 's pajamas top , what hearing her move around downstairs did to me  --  without her visible , just present . I thought , I am doing Al 's job right down to the last detail , and laughed . <p> Bernie tossed in his bed on the other side of the wall , letting out a long , in-sleep sigh . I thought of Reg then , how I did n't even sleep under the same roof with him , would never give him a real family life , never be his daddy in any real sense of the word . I thought about Amalia . I said her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and as always I remembered our one month together , living with her and her roommate in a dive apartment in Thatcher Hill  --  going out nights and dancing till I could n't breathe . How she split and then came back pregnant , then told me it was mine , told everyone it was mine , and while it certainly could have been , I could never figure why she 'd left , just up and left when the opportunity arose , and then to come back and expect me , at seventeen , mind you , to delve into a serious relationship  --  her with a child that might not even be mine , her whom I could never trust again . And so Momma kept the baby , said it was the least she could do , then Amalia was gone again , but not before she named him Reggae , for the sweet vibration of the music , she 'd said , so his life might find some harmony , she 'd said , so that maybe he would escape some of the callousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you to call me callous , you who left behind the possibility of a family , a home , when you abandoned something real and good for the first dream that showed itself to you , and then to expect to take it all back , to pick up right where we left off . Me ? Callous ? <p> I thought about how life just seems to go along and then for no particular reason you find yourself at a moment where you know something is going to happen , something that will make a difference in everything you 've done up to that point and in everything to come . I lay there knowing the light knock would come at the door , just wondering when it would happen and what I would do . <p> She sat on the foot of the bed and asked me if I wanted anything before she turned in . I thought I smelled booze . She said , " You 're a wonderful , wonderful man , Jim . You really are . " <p> " You just do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you . Al used to be wonderful , too . " <p> " And now ? " <p> " Now he 's just a shit . Now he could care less if I live or die . " <p> " He cares , Linda . He really cares . " <p> " It 's just the goddamned company and how big he can make it . Big Bad Al Makes me sick . Tells me we might have to go to Iowa , of all places . " <p> " It 's not that bad .... " <p> " And he sleeps around . Thinks I 'm so stupid I do n't know . But he does n't try to hide it . Not at all . He 's such a shit ! " She had been drinking , now I could tell . She looked in through my eyes the way you do when you 've gone just so far that your tongue starts to move on its own , and the words that spill out surprise even yourself because you know how true they  --  are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever be . She put her hand softly on my good leg and started to cry . <p> " Hush now , hush , " I said . Then I held her in my arms . I felt the warmth of her cheek against me  --  blood moving under skin , her hair looking so soft I had to touch it . <p> From my chest , she said , " I 'm leaving him . I ca n't take it anymore . I know it 'll be hard , but I 've got to do it . I 've got to . We deserve better . " <p> I thought , Yes , we do . I 'd forgotten about Bernie , about everything else . Then , for some reason , I said ; " He loves you very much , more than anything you know . " <p> " He 's forgotten the meaning of the word , " she said , as if she 'd been waiting for her cue . " He thinks love is getting a piece of ass in some cheap motel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thinks love is seeing how many women he can make in a month , just like selling goddamned encyclopedias  --  thinks if you tally up enough of them , you 'll be better off , that it 's all just like trying to get some poor sucker to buy something he does n't want , but he does n't realize I wo n't play along anymore . " <p> When she left she did n't close the door , and I heard her sobbing in her room down the hall . I looked down at Al 's silk pajamas and saw the wet spots where her head had been . I lay awake until everything was quiet , until the dull light of dawn made the world look black and white , until the sun put everything in living color ; and I went to sleep . <p> " You 're one dead nigger . " It was Al 's voice , and it was n't Al 's voice , on the phone . I was in my own apartment , a week later , at least able to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I said his name , I heard my own voice , and then the hollow buzzing of the dial tone . The phone rang again a minute later . It was Linda . She was at her sister 's with Bernie . When she told Al she was leaving , he went crazy , started throwing things . She said he thought it was because of me . She said she could n't believe that he was acting like this , that I should have seen his face . She was scared . She said she needed to see me . I asked her directions and told her I 'd be right over . <p> I drove as fast as I could , using just my left foot . When I got there she was having a drink with her sister , who was much older . No one ever told me her name . Linda put her arms around me . " Oh , Jim , I 'm so scared , " she said . Then she told me Al said he 'd kill us all , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he was just overreacting , that he 'd calm down sooner or later ; it was bound to be a shock to him . <p> I sat outside on the porch to get some air and to try and stay cool while Linda and her sister talked quietly at the table . The apartment was a second-story flat that looked down on a long , tree-lined street of other two-family homes . I tried to relax , breathing in through my nose , out through my mouth . One , two . <p> Al came a few minutes later , just as the late afternoon heat was getting my leg to aching almost as badly as it ever had . When he turned the corner , I realized how stupid I 'd been to leave my car out front ; and I wondered why I had even come , what good I could do . <p> He left his car right in the middle of the street , and I could hear him slamming against the door downstairs before I was out of my chair . I asked Linda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Linda , you do it , " I said . <p> Then he was at the door , shaking it . From across the room I noticed it was n't even locked . <p> He was wearing his black pinstripe . His tie was off . You could see his chest full of dark hair , just as dark and oily as the hair on his head . I 'd seen the gun once before . It was his father 's , he 'd said , though he probably won it in a card game . He pointed it at my head . I could see the ivory through his hands . For a time the pain in my leg went away . The angular lines of the strange apartment swayed up and down as if I were the only thing in the room that was n't moving , as if I were standing in the center of a seesaw watching images move all around me . He said , calmer than I thought possible , " Does she know you were there , too ? Did you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell her that while you fucked her in my own bed ? " <p> " Al , you 've got it wrong  --  " <p> " Shut up ! " he shouted , and Linda 's sister started crying again . Linda did n't move . Bernie came down the hallway , but did n't say anything either . I looked at the gun , that small thing , a tiny black hole , a bullet that could whiz right through me . I was calm , waiting for the flash . I thought I knew what it would feel like . I thought he would do it ; it never crossed my mind for an instant that he would n't . I thought that same gun had been pointing at me since the beginning of time ; it had finally caught up with me  --  everything seemed right . The apartment I 'd never been in . The woman I 'd never have , the hysterical sister who had started to pray . The way Bernie clutched at the bottom of his flannel shirt and Linda 's mouth hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd been happy , and now I 'd have to pay , again . Amalia had run away . Reg was n't mine . Linda and Bernie were lost .... Al would shoot . These all converged in that moment  --  that was the great fulcrum I thought I had reached , so when he turned and left , all I could do was leave , too . <p> Here 's what I do when business is slow . I look around my cart at all the different flowers and try to imagine which ones are like the people I have known in my life . Tall , ordained with rows of flowers , Amalia is often a yellow gladiolus . Al is anything that is fiery and dark . Linda is opaque , white or blue . Last week I got some carnations for the senior proms . In their packaging , rows upon rows of them , I saw a mass of tiny children waiting to gain form . I wondered if Reg was still among them . <p> I drove the Lincoln downtown , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we worked . I stopped next to the curb and popped twice the dosage of pain killers . I counted up six rows of windows , over four , to our adjacent offices . The Venetian blinds were pulled shut . I watched them for a long time , feeling each breath come only if I willed it , as a child in a movie house waits for the featured phantom to claim another victim . I thought at any moment the blinds would burst open , though I wondered who would be standing there , me or Al . <p> I drove pest the capitol buildings and all the construction . This will be a new town soon , one I wo n't recognize , I thought . I drove past my high school , the playground where I shot hoops and played baseball and sometimes brawled about childish things . I drove through alleys to a spot where I 'd party with some friends . It looked the same . I drove past rows and rows of brick apartment buildings joined together like some huge , segmented creature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker , thought I could hear the streetlights humming as their filaments warmed and they pushed out a faint light . I pulled the knob that turned on the car 's headlights , revealing black faces , white eyeballs , grins , a dog with red-brown matted fur , cars without license plates , cracked glass , no tires , garbage cans turned on their sides , torn-apart plastic bags spilling out their contents . I turned a corner , rushed through a light changing from green to yellow and saw a couple walking arm in arm . The woman wore a fur coat , hair in a bun , black leather pumps . My lights fell on her neck , the tip of her ear , the corner of her cheek . A child ran across the road in the distance , just beyond my headlights . I could barely see his lanky frame reaching for a ball in the gutter . I turned another corner and I was in a different neighborhood . A few lights were left on in each of the shops along Canal Street . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on small wooden signs , the shiny brass cymbals of a drum set , colorful clothes hanging side by side on long racks  --  mannequins holding out their arms , kneeling , as if to say , Please , please . <p> Al 's living in Iowa now , still with Great Books , still big and bad , as Linda put it when she called the other night  --  after almost a full year of not calling , for no reason that I could figure  --  but I can just hear him talking to her , starting out smooth and relaxed , heavy on the chitchat , then suddenly changing the tone , catching her off-guard , asking if she 'd remarry him , telling her that without their time together his life would n't have been worth a dime . But soon he was asking about me , working her hard , allowing those long , uncomfortable periods of silence where you know they 'll have to say something , anything , but just before they do , you break in , cut them off , weaken them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget what 's going on , who you are . It 's when you need the sell , when you know this one 's got to be it , or things will keep slipping . So you push them to the breaking point ; you pull out all the stops ; you do n't give them a choice . <p> If you put cut flowers in cold water or feed your plants cold water , you are , in effect , killing them . The water should be right at body temperature , so when you put your hand under the faucet you do n't feel anything at all . People do n't realize this . Especially when it 's hot , people think , " I 'll give my plants a nice , cool drink . " It does n't work that way . <p> Plants are so fragile , so delicate . Look in people 's eyes sometime when they 're admiring a flower . It 's a different kind of gaze than you 'll see anyplace else . ' Cause what they 're seeing is something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't find the colors of a flower on any sign , in any magazine . You wo n't find their texture in even the best materials . That 's what my customers are buying . That 's the beauty of it . I 'm not a salesman , I 'm just an intermediary . I make it possible . I provide . <p> <p> By Arnold E.
