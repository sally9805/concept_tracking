The study examined the related and unrelated employment placements of regular and " special needs " students in school-to-work programs . 168 regular students and 25 " special needs " students who completed the school-to-work programs where surveyed nine months after the program completion . Total program related employment placement for both the regular student and the " special needs " students was PSUB 69 . Total unrelated program employment placement was PSUB 68 , duplicated counts . School-to-work programs founds high employment placements for the students who completed their programming . <p> Thirteen years are spent by a student , kindergarten through twelfth grade , attempting to attain a good education . Reading , math , writing , sciences , and the many other disciplines are introduced to the student during these thirteen years . The student graduates from high school with a high school diploma . This diploma is to denote the student completed and attained a good education . However , all too often students graduate and receive a high school diploma , yet have not attained skills necessary to enter the work force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates fall short of employable skills when they complete the twelfth grade . Many of these students do not continue their education past the high school level . The students who drop out of school or are " special needs " students fall even further behind the students who graduate from high schools . Thusly , educators are attempting to improve the pedagogical processes of youth with curriculum geared directly toward the work force . The school-to-work programs offer students such a program . School-to-work programs allow students to select from a variety of programs , an alternative to traditional high school curriculum , finding success with many of their students finding employment once they have completed the programming . Many school districts are now looking at school-to-work programs for their students . <p> Traditional high school curriculum offered students an introduction to many areas of study . The major disciplines , offered as required courses , taught students English , science , math , and history . Elective courses in high school offered students an introduction to areas of study in which the student held an interest such as foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the elective courses built a foundation of cognition in their areas of study . However , neither the required nor the elective courses prepared the students adequately for the work force . Math , as well as the other areas of study , offered sufficient cognition for day to day living , but did not prepare the student to enter the job market . Computer classes built a foundation of computer skills but lacked the necessary curriculum for a student who desired to become a lab technician . School-to-work programs offer students an entire curriculum focused on a career goal . Classes are offered to prepare a student for a specific job position . The lab technician curriculum in a school-to-work program may require a sequence of eight courses to complete the program . Each course in the sequence is geared to complete a holistic career program . Once all courses are successfully completed , the student has received more than an introduction into the area of study . <p> The student emerges with intensive training in a school-to-work program and is more thoroughly trained to enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high school graduation never continue their education past high school . Those students that attempt to continue their education beyond high school never complete their degrees in schools of higher learning . Since the majority of high school graduates never continue their education , nor complete higher degrees , it becomes imperative to educate students in high schools with employable skills . School-to-work programs allow students to commute to their centers via school buses . The students receive high school credits upon successful completion of courses offered at the centers . The students also may earn collegiate credit for successful completion of certain programming and meeting certain criteria set forth by the local community college . By attending courses at the centers , the student avoids paying tuition for the comparable courses offered at community colleges . School-to-work programs offered to high school students eliminates tuition , and also eliminates the additional time needed to attend courses beyond high school . <p> When students drop out of school , their chances of obtaining employment which will sustain a comfortable lifestyle drastically declines . Educators must address the needs of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . School-to-work programs help address the dilemma of drop outs . School-to-work programs offer areas of interest to students , not traditional required courses . Lack of interest is a major consideration to the drop out . Should a student still elect to drop out midway though the programming , some employable skills have already been learned , and the remainder of the program can be completed in the future . <p> " Special needs " students are welcomed and their needs are tried to be met at the centers offering school-to-work programs . Paraprofessionals are assigned to the " special needs " students . " Special needs " students are trained in employable skills while attending high school ; whereas , traditional high school curriculum fell short of teaching " special needs " students employable skills . <p> Students who do not excel at academia are serviced with school-to-work programs . The counselors at the centers felt the centers serviced more average to below average students . The average student seemed to find more success at the school-to-work programs due to enrollment in courses of their interest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive to the average student . The courses offered hands on programming , allowing the students to actively participate in the learning processes instead of learning by lecture and self-study . The average student tended to comply with the strict attendance policy in the school-to-work programs more readily , gaming more knowledge with everyday presence . Time clocks placed in almost every classroom helped the students adjust to a work routine . Students are required to punch in on their timecards to log the amount of class time . The average student at the centers offering school-to-work programs found more success academically , attendance wise , and was more geared routinely toward employment with the school-to-work programs . <p> The school-to-work programming varied with instructor availability and student interest . When enrollment declines , certain school-to-work programs are deleted . When enrollment increases , additional instructors are recruited to offer additional classes . Programming is versatile . Programming ranges from health , technology , business , and industry . New technology , with its fields of employment initiate new programming . The programming not only offers a complete career program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their program . School-to-work programs try to incorporate modem educational procedures along with the state 's goals and objectives , giving their students the optimum educational experiences . <p> The centers began introducing students to their school-to-work programs in the eighth grade . Recruiters gave talks , video presentations , tours , etc. to the junior high students and continued to promote the centers through-out high school to encourage students to enroll in the school-to-work programs . Students were given every opportunity to attend the school-to-work programs and to enroll through their counsellors at their home high schools . <p> Articles written by educational critics are citing the need to educate students toward employment . Two such articles , " Schools urged to stress job skills " and " School-to-work programs have merit , study reports " addressed this need . The first article reported the results of a Gallup survey regarding the education of youth . In the survey , 64% of the adults responded , " not enough is done to find jobs for kids who drop out or graduate . " 57% of the adults responded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not only did the educational critics believe in school-to-work programs , but the majority of the adults responding to the survey were also in agreement . The second article stated the Michigan Senate approved $300 million to school-to-work programs . School-to-work programs , according to this article , aid in two primary educational issues concerning youth : " how to give our young people the skills needed to compete in the global economy ; and how to educate all of America 's youth including the 75% who will not graduate from four-year colleges or who are disadvantaged and at risk of dropping out of school . " <p> It does little good to educate students in antiquated programming or in skills which are no longer employable . We no longer need to teach students blacksmithing to shoe a horse when the automobile is today 's mode of transportation . It makes better sense to teach a student automobile mechanics and automobile maintenance . Education evolves as does technology and society . The mode of education of yesterday , no longer prevails today . It becomes imperative to educate students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method <p> The programming offered students consisted of advertising design , auto body repair , automated office , automotive electronics , building maintenance , and building trades . Climate control , Culinary arts , dental assisting , diesel technology , and electronic technology were also offered students . Floral design and sales , landscape technology machine technology , marketing , and print technology completed the programming . A total of 198 students completed the two-year programming ( 11th and 12th grade ) . Of the 198 programming completers , 172 were regular students and 26 were " special needs " students . In March and April of the following year , after program completion , students were contacted via telephone and surveyed in regards to their employment . Of those students who completed the programming , 98% were contacted for the survey . The results of the survey are tabulated in a duplicated count ; whereas , if a student was working and attending school , the student was counted in both applicable categories . Results <p> Since this study concerns student employment subsequent to the training received from the school-to-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have been included for informational purposes . <p> Of the 98% of returned surveys for the regular student population , employment related placement was P 73 . Unrelated employment placement for the regular student population was P 66 ( table 1 ) . Each employment placement , related and unrelated , are substantially above the mediam of the distribution . Of the 96% " special needs " student population returned surveys , related placement was P 44 , unrelated placement was P 80 ( table 2 ) . Total related placement for the regular student and the " special needs " student was P 69 , unrelated placement was P 68 . Both percentiles are substantially above the median of distribution for the duplicated counts . Graph #1 shows the related placement of regular students with employment , education and military service . P 73 of regular students are in fields of their school-to-work program training . Graph #2 shows the unrelated placement of regular students with employment , education , and military service . P 66 of regular students are not in fields relating to the training received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related and unrelated employment placement of the " special needs " students and those students unavailable to work for a total of P 125 , duplicated count . Graph #3 shows total placement , unrelated and related , duplicated counts . Conclusion <p> The results from this study adds support to the validity of school-to-work programs offered by technical schools . The high employment placement upon program completion attests to the success of skills learned in school-to-work programs . Since most regular students were felt to be the average/below average students as well as the " special needs " students , employment placement was extremely high . One wonders if these students had not elected to enroll in a school-to-work program , would they have found employment , either program related employment or program unrelated employment after high school ? One also won-tiers if more of these students would have fallen " between the cracks " and not completed high school at all . Even though there was a high percentile of unrelated employment , one must consider the student in school-to-work programs has learned employment skills and employment ethics while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired socialization skills . The completed , holistic training program could possibly aid the student in future employment .
