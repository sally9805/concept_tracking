Our cover story this week focuses on marriage , a subject we have covered often through the years , most recently in a muchdiscussed cover story in August 1994 that looked at its flip side : infidelity . This time the focus is an informal but widespread movement , noted by senior editor Lee Aitken , aimed at shoring up marriage through the counseling of engaged couples and troubled husbands and wives , as well as through efforts to protect the children whom discord places at risk . <P> To write the story , Aitken turned to our newest senior writer , Elizabeth Gleick , who came to us from PEOPLE magazine ( as did Aitken ) . Gleick , raised in New York City , attended Yale , where she enjoyed editing the Yale Daily News Magazine more than going to classes  --  though she still graduated magna cum laude in 1985 . Back in Manhattan , she found an entry-level job at Vogue . I think I worked out because I could type fast and still get lunch every day for five people , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress as well as everyone else in the elevator . ' ' <P> In 1987 Gleick joined a short-lived magazine , New York Woman . She relished writing and editing stories , but she was conscious of working in a one-sex world . When the magazine folded , one of the things she liked about moving to PEOPLE was the chance to work with men and write about them . ' ' While there she wrote about such men as Jesse Jackson , Michael Jackson and various Kennedys , as well as about crime and earthquakes . <P> She came to TIME looking for a new challenge , and a major one awaited her : the story of O.J. Simpson 's murder trial . Last month Gleick wrote the cover story on the opening of the trial , and we shall doubtless hear more from her on that subject . Says senior editor Howard Chua-Eoan , who has worked with her both at PEOPLE and TIME : She has a particular talent for delineating character , for sifting through reporting for the detail that is just right . She would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or lack of it . ' ' <P> Marriage is a subject that Gleick , who is single , was happy to explore . She and her friends ponder it frequently . Personally , I am sometimes amazed that people can make it work , but as a society we are re-examining it at many levels . There is an urgency about saving children , although I do n't think that need necessarily involve marriage  --  families can take different forms . ' ' Enlightened views , but Gleick also has good reason to value the family 's most traditional form : to date her parents ' marriage has spanned 42 years .
