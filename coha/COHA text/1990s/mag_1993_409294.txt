Windborne snow stings the few exposed parts of my face . I am wearing woolen long johns , a woolen shirt , over-trousers made from a metallic space-age material , a dacron vest , and a jacket  --  a huge jacket  --  filled with goose down . My thick-soled mukluks would not look out of place on the moon , and my polypropylene gloves are covered by mittens made from the reversed hide of some furry animal long dead . A woolen balaclava , polarized ski goggles , and wolverine-fur-trimmed hood complete my ensemble . And despite the combined warmth of the best natural and high-tech fibers available , I am cold . I 've been sitting still for about three hours , and the antarctic wind , the snow , and even the view of the icebergs has chilled me to the bone . During that time , the Adelie penguins I have been watching have hardly moved . Apparently untroubled by the bitter cold , they lie snug on their nests of stones , incubating eggs , standing occasionally to shake the snow crystals from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I see them now , against an inhospitable landscape of ice and snow . So when I speak of penguins and thermoregulation in the same frosted breath , one might suppose that penguins need mainly to find ways to keep warm . That , however , is far from the case ; when on land , the problem most penguins face is how to keep cool . This predicament stems from their life in the sea . Penguins are flightless , aquatic creatures , and water has about twenty-five times the thermal conductance of air . To survive for long periods in water , warmblooded animals must have insulation . Whales have blubber to buffer their body heat against the waters that would draw it away . Seals have thick pelts , as well as fat . But birds have no fur and , because their ancestors dispensed with any feature that would encumber becoming airborne , they have only a limited amount of body fat . Their covering of short , stiff feathers interlock to trap air , forming the ornithological equivalent of a diver 's suit . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high latitudes where most other birds fear to tread . The same feathers that keep heat in also keep it from getting out . Thus , penguins ashore risk overheating especially penguins of temperate and tropical zones . For temperate zone penguins , such as the yellow-eyed penguins that breed on New Zealand 's South Island , walking around in a feather wet suit when temperatures approach 85deg F can be downright uncomfortable , and in the case of their chicks , life threatening . My student Phil Seddon and I found that the species avoids direct sunlight by choosing a sheltered place to nest in the coastal forest . Plants one to three feet overhead are the most important feature of the ground nest site . Birds with shaded nests rarely display signs of heat stress , while those whose nests are less than 50 percent shaded spend more time standing up and panting . Penguins breeding even nearer to the tropics seek shelter from the sun by nesting in burrows and caves . Some , like the little blue penguin , which breeds on the coasts of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ashore only after sundown . Humboldt penguins , found on the coasts of Peru and Chile , dig burrows in their own guano ( an example of food being eventually recycled as shelter ) . A close relative breeding at the equator , the Galapagos penguin avoids the sun by nesting in cracks in the lava rocks of the volcanic islands . Even at the equator , where the water temperature reaches 80deg F , the sea still acts as a huge heat sink for birds that must keep their internal temperature at about 102deg F to survive . So even tropical penguins must maintain the integrity of their feathered shield . This armor limits the penguins ' potential for physiological management of heat stress . Preventing overheating is the best tactic , but the shade of bushes and burrows can do only so much . Penguins also need " windows " that allow superfluous body heat to escape . Humboldt and Galapagos penguins and their relatives do have patches of unfeathered flesh on their face . But the chief heat radiators of penguins are their flippers and bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely short and provide , at best , only modest insulation . By controlling the position of the flippers and feet , and the blood flow to them , the birds can minimize or maximize heat loss . Hot penguins , for example yellow-eyed penguins with poorly shaded nests , hold their flippers out at an angle of about 45deg to the body . The blood vessels in the feet and underside of the flippers dilate , turning those areas pink . This is easiest to see in a bird that has just come ashore and needs to rid itself of the heat generated by swimming . When the birds are even hotter , they pant . Hyperventilating evaporates body water , using up body heat in the process . My Adelie penguins and Phil Seddon 's yellow-eyed penguins pant mostly just after midday , when temperatures are highest . Chicks also face the danger of overheating because on calm days their down is even more efficient than the feathers of adults at retaining heat . Penguins that breed in the open often shade their young chicks by standing over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate their own temperatures , and they may move away from the protection provided by their parents . The down-covered flippers of chicks hold in more heat than the flippers of adults , so chicks rely more on their disproportionately large feet to act as radiators . On hot days , they lie spread-eagled , their flippers at their sides and their feet exposed . Yellow-eyed penguin chicks may even seek out marshy ground and stand with their feet in water . Water is the true element of penguins . They come onto land only to breed and molt . The risk of hyperthermia from insolation when they are on land is the price they pay for the insulation they need at sea . Ultimately , if the heat becomes unbearable , they can go back to the sea . At the equator , Galpagos penguins have been observed to abandon their nests and retreat to the ocean , leaving their eggs or chicks to fry in the sun . The nesting Adelies I have been observing should not have to resort to such extreme measures . And as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cool dip is the last thing I want to contemplate . <p>
