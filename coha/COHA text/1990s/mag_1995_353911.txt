THE CHINESE , WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR SHARE OF HISTORICAL cycles , say there is a visible momentum governing human affairs . Their epic novel Three Kingdoms begins by declaring that empires rise and then fall into chaotic fragments ; but from those many small kingdoms , powers coalesce to form new empires to restore order to the cosmos . A grandiloquent way of saying , Sometimes you 're up , sometimes you 're down , sometimes you 're big , sometimes you 're small . For those who believe in such chronic convulsions , the business world last week provided the spectacle of two cycles reaching opposite apogees at once , of simultaneous expansion and fragmentation . But here is the twist on the ancient adage : one corporation divides , the better to thrive ; two companies , meanwhile , join for astonishing cash flow  --  but in so doing step into new uncertainties . <P> " I 'm tired of being little all the time , " Ted Turner crowed last week . " I want to see what it 's like to be big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a conglomerate , is bigger better ? Or is less more ? Americans could be forgiven if they were confused by last week 's economics lesson . First they witnessed the three-way breakup of AT &T,; and then , just 48 hours later , the rebirth of Time Warner as the world 's largest media company with its agreement to buy Turner Broadcasting . To the old but continuing question , " What 's happening to the big old phone company I grew up with ? " is added , " Will I now get all my news and entertainment from only a couple of media behemoths ? " And both are thrown into the debate over proportions and perspectives . When is an organization too big for the good of its members , its customers , its citizens ? And does the loss of human scale have a lot to do with America 's crisis of confidence about its institutions ? <P> " Big " and " small " may be elementary concepts , but defining them can be complex and contentious . Thus , is a company downsizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-party system is decrepit , but what kind of chaos would a third and fourth party bring ? The Federal Government is too big , but if it devolves its responsibilities to the states , local governments may not be big enough to take up the burden . The questions devolve to everyday life : I owe too much money , but if I did n't , I 'd never live anything close to the American Dream , which only seems to clutter itself up with a wider range of requirements each day . <P> American business has been dreaming big dreams for the past several years . Acquisitors from Disney to Chemical Bank continue to gobble up firm after firm . So far this year , there have been more than $270 billion worth of such expansions . Yet the corporate divorce rate runs high , as companies spin off partners they once bought with great fanfare . In fact , Wall Street investors are scouting bargains among once acquisitive companies that are now dubbed " tangerines " because they seem ripe to be taken apart in segments . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be most remembered for the resulting layoffs by the thousands as employees were spat out like fruit seeds .
