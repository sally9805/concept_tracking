<p> When you 're talking drag on the U.S. economy , drain on worker productivity , pernicious influence in the workplace , you are talking , of course , about . . . <p> Rotisserie baseball . <p> This week marks the start of the season in Major League Baseball - that is , real baseball played on grass by millionaires with bats , balls and chewing tobacco . But the coming of spring and the annual rebirth of our national pastime herald the arrival of another kind of baseball - the kind played on paper by accountants , secretaries , bankers , lawyers and dentists with computers and , perhaps , too much time on their hands . <p> About 2 million people are expected to play Rotisserie baseball this year , up from exactly 10 in 1980 . In their drive to keep up with the stupefying stream of statistics they need to track the performance of their players , many Rotisserians will make use of the office computer , fax machine , long-distance lines and photocopier . Instead of reviewing loan applications or filling teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next Kirby Puckett or Greg Maddux . <p> So the question must be asked : Rotisserie baseball - boon or bane ? <p> " You can not use the rise in popularity of Rotisserie League Baseball as an explanatory factor for the decline in the growth rate of U.S. productivity , " says David Berson , chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association . This is not the opinion of an objective economist . Berson has two Rotisserie teams - the New Town Nine and the Columbia Cassowarys . At the time of his statement , he admits , 90% of the material in his briefcase is Roto-related . <p> Rotisserie baseball is an obsession , a sickness , a blight , says Valerie Salembier , publisher of Family Circle magazine . She was one of the game 's 10 founders and the only woman among the original team owners . <p> By the time she quit in 1984 , " I was totally obsessed , " says Salembier , who found herself walking out of business meetings to take calls from other team owners anxious to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be playing , " she says . " Those guys were serious and competitive and mean . They 'd be really nice to me , trying to get me to think they liked me , and then they 'd screw me on some trade . " <p> Some committed Rotisserians could be , well , committed . San Diego dentists Ron Johnson and Gordon Dixon , who play in a league with seven other dentists and a lawyer , maintain a Rotisserie hot line in their office . <p> " Our priority calls are about ( Rotisserie ) transactions , " says Johnson . " Dental emergencies follow that . " <p> When Johnson bought into Dixon 's dental practice , Dixon insisted that the contract contain a Rotisserie clause . It requires Johnson 's team , the Honduras Hosemonsters , to trade one key player to Dixon 's Cuban Redheads every year . <p> Meat Loaf , the rock singer and actor , says he chose to put together his fantasy-league draft list rather than work on his 1992 income-tax filing . " I had to file for an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things . " <p> On the road , Meat Loaf , who plays a Rotisserie-like game run by Prodigy computer service , travels with a laptop computer , a modem and a suitcase full of baseball books and fan magazines . <p> Chicago paralegal Steve Melcher lists Rotisserie on his resume . For James Wingate , a Lompoc , Calif. , accountant , the ritual begins right after Thanksgiving dinner . He pushes himself from the table and begins making a list of players he wants for the following season . He writes their names on his " goal board , " which sits next to a photo taken of him when he was the Cleveland Indians batboy in the 1960s . <p> Almost all Rotisserians agree on two things : <p> First , you can tell a lot about a person 's work habits by how he or she runs a Roto team . " There 's a very close correlation , " says Dan Okrent , managing editor of Life magazine and the father of Rotisserie baseball . " If you saw how I run my team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't know talent when I see it . That 's pretty much my style here in the office , too . " <p> The numbers bear him out . He has never finished first in the 13 seasons since he began playing the game and named it for La Rotisserie Francaise , the Manhattan restaurant where he concocted it . <p> Salembier says Rotisserie taught her enough about Okrent and their fellow founders to know she never wanted to do business with them in the real world . " They 're garbage . They 'd sell their mothers for a good rookie , " she says . <p> Second , lawyers are the meanest , nastiest , most contentious Rotisserie players . <p> " No question , " says Lew Fidler , executive director of the Rotisserie League Baseball Association and himself a lawyer in private practice . Fidler says more and more Rotisserians are asking the RLBA to mediate their disputes by issuing rules interpretations . " Several of the lawyers keep asking for written opinions , but that 's where I draw the line , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer at NBC , gets his rulings closer to home . His office assistant , Tammy Brown , acts as commissioner of the league in which his Friedman Fools play . In return , he says , " she gets to keep her job . " <p> Workplace experts are divided about Rotisserie baseball . Where several team owners work in the same office , the game " allows people to build relationships that pay off when it comes time to work together , " says Bill Fromm , author of The Ten Commandments of Business &; How to Break Them . <p> The RLBA 's Fidler says the fantasy sport acts as a social lubricant in the office . But some Roto players acknowledge spending up to an hour a day - at work - going over stats , making roster changes or trying to arrange trades . Those workers are , in essence , " stealing from their bosses , " says Neil Lewis , a management psychologist . <p> Columnist and baseball nut George Will agrees . " A boss has a right to be concerned . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can go to the ballpark , " he says . Besides , " fantasy baseball is to baseball what Monopoly is to capitalism . " <p> The Japanese , who are good at both baseball and capitalism , are about to encounter Rotisserie . An American entrepreneur - the RLBA wo n't disclose his name until a contract is signed - is negotiating for rights to use the Rotisserie name and rules in Japan . <p> Most Japan experts , though , say Japanese offices are too serious-minded to countenance workers playing Rotisserie baseball . Should Rotisserie triumph in Japan , " it will be the ruin of the Japanese economy , " predicts Okrent . <p> The mushrooming popularity of Rotisserie baseball has made its inventor uneasy . Okrent says he began to sense trouble seven years ago when he gave a speech about the New England economy to a group of bankers . " When it was over , the host asked for questions , " he recalls . " This guy stands up and says , ' I have one , Mr. Okrent . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Okrent Fenokees are set to play their 14th season , but their owner says his sympathies have swung . " I 'm with the people who say , ' Get a life , ' " he says . " This has just gotten to be nuts . "
