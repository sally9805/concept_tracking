<p> Chuck Muncie 's last public appearance as a football star was in front of a judge . <p> But more than six years after being sentenced to prison , Muncie , possibly the best running back in Cal history , has apparently straightened his life out . Talk about coming from behind . <p> He now is drug free , educated and trying his best to see the next generation does not fall victim to the same temptations that nearly ruined him . <p> As executive director of the Port Hueneme ( Ventura County ) Boys and Girls Club , he is not hesitant to let the members hear his history . <p> " I do n't hold anything back about myself , " said the former All-American and NFL star by telephone this week . " I disclose everything about myself to these kids . That is one of the things that makes it real easy for me to communicate with them , ' Hey guys , been there , done that . ' I did it all . I did some great things , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one thing , does n't mean your life is going to be smooth all the way out . " <p> Muncie certainly has done quite a bit in his 41 years , and now the youngsters in the Southern California coastal town ( population 21,000 ) are getting the benefit of Muncie 's experience . <p> " Most of them know who I am , although they do n't remember me as a player , " said Muncie . " Their parents do , and word sort of filters down . " <p> If the parents ' recollection is accurate , it is of a 6-foot-2 , 228-pound dynamo with sprinter 's speed . He set the Cal career rushing record that lasted for 15 seasons until Russell White broke it in 1991 . The 1,477 yards Muncie netted in 1975 still stands as the school 's single-season record . In nine pro seasons with New Orleans and San Diego , he gained 6,702 yards on 1,561 carries , setting an NFL record with 19 rushing touchdowns in 1981 and appearing in three Pro Bowls . <p> " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said San Jose State assistant Roger Theder , who recruited Muncie to Cal . " I used to love to stand behind the huddle and watch him in practice . He was so graceful . It is incredible the things a man that size could do on a football field . " <p> Of course , memories of celebrities ' shortcomings tend to have a longer shelf life , and many recall Muncie as both an academic slacker whose scholastic misdeeds put Cal in the NCAA doghouse and later as a habitual drug user , who was suspended by the NFL and wound up behind bars . <p> Muncie denies nothing . <p> " Mike White ( the Cal coach during Muncie 's time ) emphasized education , but it was n't really mandatory , " said Muncie . " They made sure we did what we had to do to stay eligible , and that was it . " <p> He realizes that he and his peers brought the NCAA watchdogs down on the school , but he claims that the Bears ' sudden rise to success while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anybody that brought in as much notoriety before we came , " he said . " We had a successful team , and a lot of people started looking at what we were doing . But I do n't think we were doing anything different than any other college in the country . " <p> Not every school had players as adept as Muncie as avoiding the classroom . Even when the coaches would walk Muncie to the front door of a class , Muncie would often duck out the back . However , the postscript is that Muncie says he did finally compile enough credits to earn a degree four years ago . <p> " The majority of guys I played with did n't graduate on time , but some of us went back and got it , " he said . " It took us a while , but we made it . " <p> As for the drugs , Muncie says he picked them up as a natural adjunct to college life 20 years ago . " I started in college , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say 90 percent of the people I knew were doing it . Some people would relax with a beer , we would relax with a beer and something else . " <p> FAMILIAR PATTERN <p> Muncie 's drug use continued during his NFL career . Although puzzling at the time , Muncie 's behavior patterns are now depressingly familiar : denials , suspensions , missed games , confessions and promises to live clean . Vida Blue , Mike Norris , John Lucas , Steve Howe , Doug DuBose , Eric Show , Dwight Gooden , Chuck Muncie . The tale is the same , just change the name and the ending . <p> Muncie admits the drug-rehabilitation programs he entered during this period did him little good . " The NFL program I went through was a joke , " he said . " You go in for 30 days , and on the 31st you are out among the same people doing the same things . A rehab program is just a tool , and you have to be willing to use it . I was n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muncie 's football career was essentially over . His training-camp trial with the Vikings the following year failed . But his lifestyle continued until he was arrested in December 1987 , ironically while he was on probation for income-tax violations . He was charged with trying to sell two ounces of cocaine . " It was more like an ounce , " said Muncie . " But it was wrong , and they wanted to make an example out of me . I got slammed . " <p> So Muncie got to spend much of the next three years in the minimum-security prison at Lompoc . " That was the best thing that ever happened to me , " said Muncie . " When the judge pounded that gavel is when I decided I had to change . Jail was my rehab program . " <p> All the while Muncie says he never lost his affection for the Boys and Girls Clubs . While not directly involved in the operations , he put considerable effort into fund-raising during his playing days . <p> " As a young kid , I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Muncie , whose formative years were spent in Uniontown , Pa . " It was a great opportunity for me to stay out of trouble and do some of the things that you are supposed to do as a kid , enjoy yourself as a kid and participate in activities and programs . Back then it was more recreational , like playgrounds . <p> " I got involved a little more heavily when I started playing pro ball . I did a lot of volunteer work and helped Boys and Girls Clubs in fund-raising . I became a spokesperson for them . I was trying to raise money because it is a nonprofit organization . " <p> After his release from prison , Muncie moved to Bullhead City near Lake Havasu , Ariz. , where he was partners in a houseboat and jet ski rental business . By this time he wanted to get more involved in the Boys and Girls Clubs and accepted the offer to run the Colorado River Boys and Girls Club in 1993 . <p> TIGHT BUDGET <p> " I had been traveling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January I was asked to speak here ( Port Hueneme ) at a board installation dinner . It must have been a helluva speech because that night they asked me if I wanted to take over and help rebuild this club . " <p> So this past March Muncie took over , and his efforts have increased membership from 126 to more than 1,600 . And as welcome as the new members are , they have put a strain on Muncie 's budget . <p> " This is n't a high income area , the average family makes somewhere between $ 18,000 and $ 20,000 a year , which is pretty low , " he said . " It 's only $ 5 a year to join our club . Kids ca n't afford the YMCA or the country club . Since Parks and Rec have pretty much vanished in this city , we are the only show in town . " <p> And it is quite a show . <p> " We are the host county-wide for Punt , Pass and Kick , " he said . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls basketball , karate . We offer tutoring and a homework club where kids can come and study . We have woodworking shops , arts and crafts , and we are setting up our computer lab . " <p> ' I 'M ALL RIGHT ' <p> And Muncie is a hands-on administrator . " I do it all , " he said . " When I first got here , I set up all the activities , hired a staff , swept the floors , repainted the inside of the place . " <p> Although his professional parting with the Chargers was not pleasant  --  he was ripped by then- owner Alex Spanos before he was traded to Minnesota  --  he has since made his peace . Former coach Don Coryell wrote a letter to the prison system on his behalf , and Muncie attended Coryell 's induction into the San Diego Hall of Fame on October 9 . Muncie , who was traded from New Orleans to San Diego in 1980 , set a club single- season rushing record with 1,144 yards in 1981 . <p> Still , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cal and signed his seven-year $ 1.6 million contract  --  a whopper at the time  --  rumors surfaced that he had squandered all his money . Those rumors are still around . <p> " I know about money , " said Muncie . " I know about making it , I know about spending it , and I know about losing it . But early on I did make some good investments in real estate . I 'm not broke . I 'm not rich , but I 'm all right . " <p> Which comes back to Muncie 's biggest asset in his new job , his experience . No matter how troubled a youngster might be , Muncie can find some common ground . " Whenever I have to deal with a kid that is having some problems , I can relate to it , " he said . " I know about drugs . I know about jail . . . . There is n't too much I ca n't cover . As a kid myself , I was run over by a truck and I was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of history . "
