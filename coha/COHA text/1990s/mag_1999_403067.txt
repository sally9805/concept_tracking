WHO DO AMERICA 'S FOOD GIANTS , FROM BURGER KING AND MCDONALD 'S TO KRAFT AND PILLSBURY , CALL WHEN THEY 'RE PICKING OUT NEW ITEMS TO PUT ON MENUS AND SUPERMARKET SHELVES ? THE TREND TRACKERS . THEY KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE EATING . // Every evening , Katie Wagner sits down at the dining table and writes in her diary . But instead of reporting her thoughts about the events of the day , the people she 's met , the places she 's been , she meticulously records what she and each member of her family-her husband Gary and their two boys , Kyle and Kalebhave eaten at breakfast , lunch and dinner as well as in-between snacks . " I 've done it fo the last four or five years , " says Wagner , a part-time social worker and waitress from Enumclaw , Washington . " It helps me set up for the next day because I know what we 've had . " Serving her family a varied diet is n't the purpose of her writing exercise , however . Rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just one of 13,000 families participating in two annual surveys aimed at tracking the tastes-literally-of American consumers : NET ( what we eat at home ) and CREST ( what we order in restaurants ) . Conducted by The NPD Group , a New York-based market research firm , the surveys provide a banquet of data that subscribing clients , including companies from McDonald 's and Burger King to Kraft , Heinz and Nestle , use to direct the creation and marketing of food products . Over the past decade , NPD 's annual reports have had a direct impact on what we get in grocery stores and fast food restaurants-as well as what we do n't . Vlasic , the pickle producer , jumped when the firm observed that among Americans , the most popular way to eat pickles is in a sandwich . Vlasic 's Stackers , pickles that are sliced as thinly as sandwich meat , soon made their appearance on supermarket shelves . NPD 's finding that Americans were struggling to fine ways to get more veggies into their diet spurred Pillsbury to introduce " Create-A-Meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes and sauce to which consumers need add only meat or chicken . " Create-A-Meal " now adds $150 million a year to PiLlsbury 's coffers . Prompted by NPD data on Americans ' increasing fondness for grilled food , Kraft generated new versions of its market-leading Bull 's Eye Bar-b-que Sauce , including Bull 's Eye teriyaki and Cajun grilling sauces aimed at consumers on the West Coast where the popularity of barbecuing was growing fastest . And when the surveys indicated families were eating more poultry Burger King brought out the BK Broiler , a chicken sandwich . The chain also nixed following Wendy 's lead in introducing pita bread when NPD discovered that pita patrons cut back on orders of French fries , a high-profit item . And Burger King backed away from offering a lean burger similar to McDonald 's McLean ( since withdrawn ) when tracking showed that families were less concerned about fat and sodium than they had been . " Thanks in part to NPD , we did n't go down that road , " crows Barry Schwartz , director of consumer research for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have food giants paying NPD hundreds of thousands of dollars annually " We get at real behavior , " says NPD Vice President Harry Balzer , who has been involved in the surveys and their analyses since he joined the company two decades ago . NPD started tracking restaurant orders in 1973 , and in 1980 began tracking general eating trends . " We specialize in finding out what people are doing rather than what they say they are doing , " he declares . " Often those two things are quite different . " THE CURRENT EDITION of Eating Patterns in America , a 293-page tome of tables and commentary put together by Baker and based on data collected in 1997 and 1998 , documents that discrepancy . Among the unflattering findings , drawn from more than a million bits of information on 450,000 meals , everything from the way people prepare their eggs to the kind of packaging each ingredient they buy comes in : Despite our loud concern about healthier diets , eight of the 10 most popular lunch and dinner items are the same as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly sandwiches , hot dogs , macaroni and cheese , steak , baked chicken and hamburgers . ( On the plus side , turkey sandwiches and frozen entrees have replaced sandwiches made of cheese or bologna in the top 10 . ) The number of individuals consuming low- or nocholesterol , low-sodium and sugar-free items continues to drop from peak levels in 1990 . We 're eating fewer vegetable side dishes , but our devotion to desserts remains unchecked . Chicken nuggets fried in fat are the most popular dish at I restaurants and soda is the fastest-growing drink . Pop tarts are more popular than ever , appearing in 3% of all breakfasts eaten in the U.S. , up from 1% in 1990 . BALZER IS N'T SURPRISED . He finds that though a few individuals may be quick to change their habits , as a nation we move very slowly " If you bet on what is true today being true in the future , 80% of the time you 'll be right , " he observes . Clients get the message . " When we work on new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president of consumer knowledge , " we remember not to make anything too strange , that it 's important to keep food familiar . " Not all of Balzer 's advice is heeded . Alarmed at the rising number of consumers eating in their cars , he urged fast-food companies to make their offerings easier to eat while driving , noting that burger condiments invariably ooze out the sides and pizza toppings frequently slide off the slices . Balzer also recommended that auto makers install food trays as well as cup holders in cars . There were no takers . " No one wants to promote eating in the car because of the liability issue , " he says . THE MOST SURPRISING news of the 1998 report , says Balzer , is that " for the first time , alcohol appears on dinner tables more frequently than coffee . " The percentage of people who have a drink with dinner has been steadily rising since 1990 . The trend is being driven primarily by those aged 45 and older , who 've been reading that a drink a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the percentage of those who have a daily drink has nearly doubled , from 10% in 1990 to 19% last year . " That age group tends to glom onto health trends faster than anybody else , " Balzer explains . " It was true of low-sodium and low-fat diets . They are always looking for an easier way-other than eating less and exercising more-to better health . " Balzer believes the uptick in drinks with dinner also signals another significant shift in our habits : rather than subtracting unhealthy foods or ingredients from the diet , we now prefer to add healthpromoting ones . The percentage of people who take a daily vitamin , mineral supplement , herbal product or other dietary aid has hit a new peak : 45% . " I tell my clients , if you put something good in your food , tell consumers about it , " Balzer advises . WHAT DO THE FINDINGS say about coffee ? Not that alcohol is replacing java . Rather it reflects coffee 's basic problem : it 's inconvenient . " You have to make it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either easier or cheaper . Coffee is neither and its intake at home has held steady over the years . // In a Dinner Slump // The convenience factor is also what 's spurring the hottest food trend of the decade : home replacement meals . For the uninitiated , that 's industry jargon for take-out foods sold in restaurants and grocery stores . The average American household brings home a restaurant meal about once every 10 days , compared to once every 20 days during the mid-1980s . " This has been a trend for as long as I have been looking at the data , " says Balzer . " We still eat most of our meals at home because of budgetary restrictions . But we try not to cook . And if we have to cook , we try not to make anything from scratch . " Dinners that include at least one homemade item are continuing to slump , he notes , and onedish meals are on the rise . LOOKING 100 YEARS INTO the future , Balzer predicts that the number of people who are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third of all women and one-quarter of men will still be bemoaning their weight . Myriad diet plans have been in and out of favor over the past 15 years , Balzer notes , but " these numbers have not budged . " Where he does forsee a difference is in food preparation . Indeed , he predicts that the way we prepare our foods will change more than what foods we eat . The kitchen of the next century , says Balzer , will have more warming and heating than cooking appliances , continuing a trend that started with the introduction of the microwave . " That 's another thing I tell my clients , " he declares . " Do n't ever underestimate how lazy people can be .
