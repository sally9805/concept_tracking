IF SHE WANTS to make herself feel wistful , she remembers this : The family was young . The mother , the father , and the three girls set off for the beach . <p> It was unusual for them to go anywhere special , since the family did n't have much money . Kennedy had just been elected . The price of bread and milk had gone up , and the family went through a lot of bread and milk . Also butter and jelly and roast beef . Bologna for the sandwiches . Campbell 's scotch broth soup . The father worked a lot . The mother was beginning to worry a lot . She was beginning to snap at the girls , desperation growing in her voice . <p> The family drove to the beach and stayed at what seemed to the little girls like a mansion . A big gray clapboard house with a two-car garage . A lawn that went on and on before dropping off into the ocean . The father 's boss lived there with his second wife . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girls . The new wife wore her hair swept up , like a Miss America contestant . She wore lipstick in the house ! <p> She remembers the other visitor , the boss 's sister . She , too , was mysterious . She wore short-shorts and a shirt that showed her bellybutton . The mother whispered to the girls , " Mae is divorced . " The oldest girl shared a room with Mae-a room with two twin beds . Lilacs on the bedspreads . Mae went to bed late . The little girl got in her bed and opened the drawer of the bedside table . Inside was the biggest Nestle Crunch Bar she had ever seen in her life . It was already open . <p> The idea of having food in a bedroom was new to her . She folded back the wrappers , the blue-and-white outer wrapper and then the thin aluminum one , and broke off an even row of chocolate . She was n't afraid of being caught . She was sure that someone who was divorced did n't notice things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , that row of chocolate savored in the dark under the lilacs . But the best thing happened on the second and last day of the visit . The new wife put on an apron that said , " Kiss the Cook . " She gave the mother a cup of coffee and made her sit down at the kitchen table but would n't let her help . " You just relax , you little thing . Y'all are company . " The boss was still asleep . He had had a lot to drink the night before . The drink he liked had a man 's name . " Get me another Johnny Walker , " he said several times to the wife . " Yes , Frank , " she said every time . <p> Two of the sisters were reading the funnies from the Sunday paper together on the floor , loving the feel of the shag carpeting beneath them . Then the father came into the room and said , " Hey , who wants to go for a swim ? " The oldest daughter jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put on her bathing suit , a red one-piece with a white anchor at the chest . The girl and the father walked across the lawn and down the sandy hill . She could n't believe she had her dad to herself They held hands and ran into the ocean . The tide was way , way out . They walked and walked , but still the water did n't go past her knees . The water was clear and there were shells there for the taking . The sun was on their shoulders . They walked and walked . Girl and father . Father and girl . <p> They did n't think about the breakfast that was being made or the mother or the other little girls . The girl thought about a picture she saw once of the father when he was nine years old . He was sitting at a school desk , wearing a white shirt and tie , hair parted don the middle . His face showed that he was already a serious little boy . His father was dead ; his family was poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She decided she would always , always protect him . <p> The breakfast was good-grits and bacon and eggs and biscuits-but nothing compared to walking in the gentle ocean with the boy-father . <p> The now-grown daughter comes out with a blue plate of sliced oranges and joins her father on the front stepwhat her mother used to call the stoop-waiting for the delivery boy from the Chinese takeout to find Lake Street . They 've put in a sweat-soaked afternoon together . Joe worked the electric lawnmower , which apparently operates best when cursed at every few minutes . Maureen raked and gathered the clippings . Then they trimmed the hedges , the pine trees , and the finger-piercing rose bushes . At 68 , Joe is still able to muster the energy and optimism he 'd summoned in teaching his daughters to ice skate , to play tennis and to drive . <p> " Maureen , you 're one heck of a worker . " <p> " Me ? You 're the old workhorse . Anybody else would take two days to do all that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue a fresh coat of paint . Then I 'll mun up to Minihane 's and buy a couple of scarlet geraniums to put in front of her . " <p> " How exciting , " Maureen says . It bothers her that he spends more time with that statue than some people do with their spouses . He pants it twice a year . Sometimes he goes with a classic all-white look . Other times he 's a little more ambitious and does the veil in pale blue ( Blessed Mother blue , he calls it ) , the snake under Mary 's foot in green with black spots , the snake 's tongue a sinister red . He wipes it down with a wet cloth a couple of times a week . When it snows , the statue is the first thing he uncovers-before the steps , before the driveway , before the front walk . He keeps it ringed with flowers-geraniums in the fall , pansies or tulips in the spring . <p> " Why do n't you forget about old Mary on the Half Shell and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maureen , I hate senior citizens . They 're boring . All they talk about is their aches and pains . You see them in the aisles at Shop &; Save , their carts always in the way , while they stand there and compare the price of Feenamint and Ex-Lax . " <p> They see a pin-curl flattened head on the other side of their hedge . It 's the neighbor from next door , Lucy Rufo . She yells for her dog , " Mitzi ! Mitzi ! Get in here , bad dog . Bad dog ! " <p> Joe says , " Mitzi is making another break for freedom . " <p> " Run , Mitzi , run ! " Maureen says in a low voice . <p> Then , like a woman remembering a cake in the oven , Joe puts his orange slice down and says , " Where 's your mother ? " <p> " I put her in on the bed . Let 's let her sleep . " <p> Joe makes a movement as if to stand up . Maureen knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a fake . Her father expects her to say , " Stay . I 'll go , " and jump up to check on her mother . It 's a game that started years ago , a game that involved a competition between Maureen and her sisters to see which of them could be Daddy 's favorite . " Do we have any cream ? " he 'd say with a quick glance at the table as they all began breakfast , half out of his chair . " I 'll get it , " Maureen would say , rushing to wait on , help , be of use to Dad . <p> Maureen remains seated next to her father on the steps . She puts her hand on his arm and says , " She 's only been napping for half an hour . Eat your orange . " <p> She worries he is n't getting enough potassium . He lives on microwaved prepared foods . The higher they are in sodium , the more he likes them . He never ventures beyond microwaving into , say , cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been touched in years . Patty once brought the cheese grater out to her father as he sat reading the newspaper in the living room and said , " Dad , do you know what this is ? " <p> " You 've got me . I do n't go in for that fancy equipment , " he said . He ca n't be bothered peeling potatoes or broiling a steak . The only function of the big roasting pan is to serve as a reminder of the kind of meals that once came out of her mother 's kitchen . <p> Maureen and her sisters often tease their father about exerting minimal effort in the kitchen , and he plays along . When Maureen arrived this morning , she was thrilled to see that he 'd bought bananas since her last visit . " Dad , you bought bananas ! Great . " <p> " Now all I have to do is eat them , " he 'd said . <p> " Do n't forget to peel them , Dad , " she 'd shot back . <p> He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Oh , no wonder they tasted funny . I thought all I had to do was take that little sticker off . " <p> Joe sighs and picks up the orange . " I do n't know how anyone can sleep in this heat . " <p> " Mom can sleep through anything , and that 's what I want to talk to you about . Dad , your loyalty is out of this world . I admire it . But the other side of it is that , even though you 're the king of denial , you 've got to admit it 's getting to be too much for you . It 's been ten years since the diagnosis . It 's time to put her in a nursing home . Our whole family is becoming dysfunctional over this . " <p> Joe hears her out before saying , " Denial . Dysfunctional . Gee , those are nice things to say to your father . I remember when we were a happy family . I do n't want to talk about this , Maureen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange , trying to command some of his old authority in hopes of cutting her off . <p> " I said it to Patty and Susan . I 'll say it to you . I can manage . She 's no trouble . She 's very meek , very resigned . She 's accepted it . She 's shown great courage . " <p> Maureen can hear the fear in his voice , which almost breaks on the word " courage . " I am hearing an old man 's last stand , she thinks . She shuts her eyes , takes a deep breath in , and blows it out through her mouth . She does n't believe her mother has made a choice of acceptance as some magnificent act of courage . She believes her mother had always been resigned- " defeated from birth , " Susan put it . The disease has affected her brain in such a way that it 's made her docile and childlike . Those are the facts , as the daughters see them . <p> JOE IS staring at the grass , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He can see her in the black knit dress that she wore with a simple strand of pearls . Why do n't women get dressed up like that any more ? Friends and family called her Honey . It was the color of her hair . It was the sweetness of her nature . Honey . She wore the dress with black suede high . heels and a belt to match . People said she looked like Grace Kelly . <p> He feels tired . He 's been unable to sleep in the heat , and he 's weary of his well-meaning daughters urging him to institutionalize his wife . <p> " Maureen , 38 years ago I took a vow to love , honor and obey that girl , " he says , motioning with his head toward the quiet house . <p> " Dad , do n't call her a girl . " She hurls an orange peel . <p> " I would have tremendous guilt feelings if I broke those vows just because she got sick . Remember , in sickness and in health . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rebuttal . " Dad , what makes you think putting her in the nursing home means you 're breaking those vows ? She 's incontinent . She 's almost nonverbal . God , she does n't even know us . The doctor said her reasoning is at the level of a twoyear-old , which puts her at about the level of Jay . " Jay was Maureen 's last boyfriend . Neither of them cracks a smile , despite being a family fond of making light of human foibles , tragedies and bad hairdos . <p> " Sweetie , I know all this already . What 's your point ? " <p> " Dad , we 're worried about you . " <p> " I 'm all right , " Joe snaps . " She 's no bother . " <p> Maureen is incredulous . " No bother ? " Then she 's quiet . She can see she 's making her father angry . The high blood pressure shows in his face . <p> The doctor says her mother should n't be left alone . So Maureen comes twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fun . He goes grocery shopping . Sometimes he 'll go to the mall . Sometimes he goes to lunch with one of her sisters . While he is out , Maureen gives her mother a shower , first removing her easy-to-remove clothing . She unzips the velour robe or pulls off the velvet jogging outfit as her mother sits on the toilet . She tells her mother , " Skin the cat . " A few years ago , her mother understood that that meant she should raise her arms . Now Maureen says , " Skin the cat , " and then stares at the motionless woman in front of her . Sometimes Maureen says , " Damn it . " Then the remorse comes . " Okay , Mom . We have to take your clothes off so you can take a shower . Wo n't that be nice ? Do n't you want a nice warm shower ? " Then she struggles with her mother 's arms , lifting one and then the other . She looks at her face in the bathroom mirror . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being a good daughter . She smiles at her mother . " Come on , we 're going to wash your hair , honey . " <p> She sits her mother down on the toilet and takes off her rubber-soled shoes . Next she pulls off the stockings : knee highs in summer , knee socks in winter . The skin on her mother 's shins is dry and flaky . Maureen feels like gagging . She quickly undoes the adult-sized diaper , a tab on each side . She reaches into the bathroom closet and pulls out a plastic bag . She drops the diaper in and then knots the bag several times , as if the sodden diaper was going to try to fight its way out . She chats during this procedure , saying the most inane things imaginable . " Mom , I made Dad try Indian food last night . Can you imagine Dad eating Indian food ? You know , Mom , it 's going to snow tonight . Yup . Lots of snow . We 'll have to make you some hot chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Maureen during the shower ordeal . She avoids eye contact like a dog being reprimanded . This infuriates Maureen . " Damn Catholic Church , " Maureen mutters , directing the nozzle over her mother 's head , " you do n't even know your own name , but you ca n't forget that you 're supposed to feel shame about your body , huh , Mom . Okay . Close your eyes now . Good girl . Does n't that feel nice ? " <p> The doctor says that , with her healthy heart and lungs , she could live another 20 years . She is , after all , ten years younger than her husband . The doctor says Joe is being unreasonable , that the daughters must leave him to his own devices , stop helping him , let him become so exhausted that he admits he ca n't manage . <p> Maureen presses on , pitying him but determined . " Dad , I love Mom , but the fact is she is a bother . I understand your guilt . I have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to put her in a nursing home and slapped me across the face . " <p> " Good for her . I hope it was a good slap . " <p> Maureen touches his arm again . " Dad , we 've been dealing with this for ten years now , and you 're tired . We 're all tired . Why ca n't we have one more happy holiday as a family , one birthday where the birthday personnot Mom-is the center of attention ? I want to invite you to the Cape for the weekend and not have to hear you refuse in your fake cheery voice because you ca n't trust anyone else to take care of her . " <p> Maureen feels her chin start to tremble . It 's a family trait , one she hates . She 'll be crying in a minute so she ends quickly . " Dad , will you just think about it ? I 'll visit a few nursing homes with you . It 'll take forever to get her in one anyway , but we should start looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe says , cross now at his daughters and at the damned disease working against his keeping things as they 'd always been . How did his kids get to be so strong-willed , he wonders . They sit together quietly for a couple of minutes . He thinks Maureen is wiping her eyes , so he does n't look at her . She gets up and picks the orange peel out of the hedge . She walks back to him and they smile at each other . <p> " Thanks for all your help , Maureen . You 're a swell kid . Let 's go in now and see how the poor thing is doing . It looks like rain , " he adds , " thank God . " <p> Joe extends his arm . Maureen takes his hand and says " one , two three , " and gives his arm a good pull . " Hey , you 're strong , " Joe says , on his feet now . He holds the screen door open for her . " I 'm going to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> " I 'll check on Mom . " Maureen pours some apple juice for her mother and sticks a flexible straw in the glass . She wonders why kids and old people are forced to drink so much apple juice . If she ever gets around to making a living will , she must get a no-apple-juice clause put in there . <p> She takes the stairs two at a time on tiptoes . She stands at the door of the master bedroom , dim because all the shades are pulled down . She and Susan and Patty shared it for awhile , three single beds with puffy bedspreads and matching curtains . When the girls worked themselves into one of their bedtime frenzies , jumping on the beds , hurling pillows , dolls and pajama tops at each other , their mother would appear suddenly in the doorway and say , " Girls , do n't make me have to come in to you . " <p> Now it 's Maureen in the doorway . Her mother is in the same position she was in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She needs to be changed , Maureen thinks . She watches her mother , feeling a little guilty about it . Her mother seems to be fascinated by something on her left ear . She 's rubbing the lobe as if it 's a worry stone . <p> " Hi , Mom , " Maureen says , as determinedly cheerful as a student nurse . She walks over and sits by her mother 's side . " You 're awake , " she exclaims , as if that were some extraordinary feat . Her mother looks in her direction and takes in Maureen 's face . She gives Maureen a searching look , like a partygoer trying to place a fellow guest who has just affectionately greeted her by name . <p> " Boy , it 's hot , " Maureen says . That pointless comment for some reason causes her mother to grin . Maureen sticks the straw in her mother 's mouth . Her mother chews on the straw . " No , honey , drink it . Suck . " Maureen 's voice has an edge to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen thinks she ca n't take any more . That 's exactly what she says to herself , " I ca n't take any more . " She has had this thought so many times it 's become a mantra . But then it becomes clear that she must-because there is more to take-and she does . Or at least she has so far . As long as he can take it , she can . If she falters , lie might . What would he be like without his hope , his acceptance , his faith ? If he gives up , she would fall apart . <p> Maureen smiles and tugs the straw out from between her mother 's teeth . " Hey , I love you , " she says . Her mother continues to gaze at her , lifting her eyebrows but not saying anything . " Love you , Mom , " Maureen repeats , a little louder , a little slower . <p> " Love you , " her mother parrots back in a dutiful , emotionless monotone . <p> Joe appears in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bed and takes the glass of juice from Maureen . He slips the straw into his wife 's mouth and she sips . " Just heard the weather report . Your old man was wrong , Maureen . No rain , " he says . " No relief in sight . " <p> The little boy was five years old when his father died , but he remembers the night of his father 's death . The older children were all crying . They were assembled in the living room with neighbors and relatives , saying the rosary with Father Nolan . The boy 's mother brought the children into the bedroom one by one to say good-bye to their father . The little boy cried when it was his turn . He did n't want to go . The grown-ups told him to be a brave boy and not to cry . The boy and his mother went into the shadowy bedroom . The boy 's father said to his wife , " Open the curtains , Kate . Let me see God 's beautiful moon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the little boy , " Be good now . Do n't forget to say your prayers . " Then he said , " Kate , hold my hand . Do n't leave me .
