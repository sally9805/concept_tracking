<p> Led by rapid increases in California and seven other Western states , the number of single fathers in the United States more than doubled in the past decade , and they now represent a significant portion of the single parents in the nation . <p> Today , one in every six single- parent households in the United States is headed by a man , according to unpublished U.S. Census figures acquired by The Chronicle . <p> " There 's been a revolution in joint custody and awarding custody to fathers , " said Andrew Cherlin , an expert on families at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Md . " Men are getting and sharing custody more than they have in the past , particularly in California , which has been a leader in divorce law changes . " <p> This revolution was the result of men 's increasing interest in child rearing , mothers ' desires to have careers outside the home and dramatic societal shifts in sex-role expectations . It also reflects a mass movement by state legislatures in the 1980s away from the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The doubling in the number of single fathers in the 1980s contrasts with the pattern during the first seven decades of this century , when divorced men were rarely given custody of their children . Now , in more than 1.6 million homes , children live with their divorced fathers all or most of the time . California has almost 260,000 single fathers . <p> Beginning in the late 1970s , California moved to promote joint custody of children after divorces , and dozens of other states followed . Only seven states  --  all in the South  --  still give clear preference to the mother . <p> Divorce experts say it is not clear yet how well single fathers are doing and whether the trend to making children live alternately with both parents has been a good move for the children . However , they agree that the increasing interest of fathers in their children 's day-to-day upbringing is good for children overall . <p> Most of the men counseled by Jeff Clark at Family Services of the Mid-Peninsula in Palo Alto " are considerably better parents after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most had not really been involved in the nitty-gritty of raising the children . " They change , though , " Clark said , " and work on ( being a better parent ) in a way that they never had to in their marriage . " <p> Although almost three-quarters of all U.S. children live with their married parents , the percentage decreased significantly between 1980 and 1990 . During the same period , the proportion of single fathers doubled from 2.1 percent of all parents to 4.9 percent . <p> The percentage of single mothers increased only slightly during the past decade , from 19.4 percent to 21 percent . <p> ONE MAN LIVED IT TWICE <p> Clark is an expert on families after divorce . He wrote his master 's thesis on the subject , and he lived it  --  twice . <p> When Clark 's parents ended their marriage years ago , everyone  --  the judge , the family , friends and neighbors  --  assumed correctly that his mother would get the children . When Clark divorced his wife four years ago , no one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His two children spend the school year with him and summer with their mother . <p> " I never even gave any thought to not having custody , " the 41- year-old counselor said . " The thing I enjoy most and am best at in life is being a dad . " <p> Other divorced men he counsels feel the same way . <p> " Modern dads have been in the delivery room and tried to nurture children better than their dads did them , " Clark said . " They become invested , and they want to remain a significant part of their children 's lives . " <p> In the time between his parents ' divorce and Clark 's breakup , not only did men become more interested in raising children , but society began to expect new parental tasks from men and women , according to Robert H. Mnookin , a Stanford University law professor who is director of the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation . <p> As a result , state legislatures swept out old custody laws in the 1980s and " judges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good parents , too , " said John David Rothschild , a Sonoma County lawyer who is chairman of the California Bar Association family law committee . <p> Mnookin and sociologist Eleanor Maccoby of the Stanford Center for the Study of Families , Children and Youth are about to publish a study on custody arrangements of 1,100 Bay Area families . <p> The book , " Dividing the Child : Social and Legal Dilemmas of Custody , " found that more fathers are " spending significant amounts of time with their children following a divorce , " Mnookin said . <p> Unlike past studies , the Stanford researchers looked not at legal custody orders but at where children from broken families actually lived in the first three years after a divorce . They found that many families had worked out dual-residency arrangements in which their children spent at least four nights with each parent during a typical two-week period . <p> Although " the overwhelming majority of children after divorce still reside with their mother , " Mnookin said , " in nearly a fifth of our families , the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 10 percent of the cases , the children were living with the father . " <p> Unlike studies in past years , Mnookin 's recent research with Maccoby " did not find nearly as many fathers dropping out ( of child-rearing ) over time , " Mnookin said . <p> SMALL PHENOMENON <p> The phenomenon of single-parent fathers has been such a small one that few experts are willing to draw sweeping conclusions about whether the trend is good for children . <p> Isabel Sawhill , an Urban Institute fellow who wrote a 1975 book on the rapid growth in the numbers of single mothers , said children are better off in general " if fathers begin to take more responsibility for their custody after a divorce . Whether they will also be better off in terms of their emotional and social growth is difficult to say . " <p> The relatively small number of children who live with their fathers seem to be better off financially , at least . In 1989 , the huge number of children in the custody of single mothers were five times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of children residing at their father 's home . <p> To make matters worse for single mothers , half of all men who are supposed to pay child support to single mothers either do not pay the full court-ordered amount or pay nothing at all . <p> But a 1989 study of U.S. and Canadian children of single parents concluded that " both single mothers and single fathers can be effective parents and that the presumed assumption that the mother is the more competent parent to raise the children in the case of separation and or divorce may not be a fair or an accurate assertion . " <p> The authors , Canadian educators Reuben Schnayer and R. Robert Orr , reported in the Journal of Divorce that custody " should be based on an assessment of the parents ( e.g. , financial situation , emotional adjustment and individual qualities ) and what they each have to offer their children , rather than being predetermined by their sex . " <p> Although researchers and judges are realizing that " fathers can be good parents , too , " as Sonoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that a preference for joint custody has worked as well as expected . <p> " Many mental health professionals believe that joint custody does n't work well if the parents are still ( fighting ) years after the divorce , " said Jeff Atkinson , a DePaul University law professor who is chairman of the American Bar Association 's child custody committee . <p> " If one parent does n't agree with it , the kid gets caught in the middle , " said demographer Cherlin , a single father who has custody of his children four days a week . <p> Another problem with joint custody arises because men usually have a higher earning potential than women . When men with joint custody agreements insist that because they are sharing in child- rearing they should not have to bear a disproportionate financial responsibility for the children , the children often end up living in conditions of near-poverty at the mother 's home , said Jan Johnston , director of research for the Center for the Family in Transition in Corte Madera . <p> " The women are actually worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the house and the kids and child support , " Johnston said . <p> That has led women , particularly many feminists , to rethink their initial support for joint custody , which was based on women 's desire " to get out and work and share the burdens of child-rearing and get on their feet again , " she said . <p> It also has led state legislatures in California and two other states to backpedal on their early 1980s backing of joint custody . In 1988 , California removed its presumption in favor of joint custody and instead told judges to give custody to the father , mother or both based on what would be best for the children . <p> " The real question  --  whether it 's a father or a mother  --  is : Are they really committed to taking care of the children as best as possible ? " said Drew Liebert , a legislative aide to Senator Gary Hart , D- Santa Barbara , who wrote the 1988 law . <p> In response to studies showing that California women appear to suffer financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective July 1 , that ties child support payments to income , not to how much the parent without custody visits the child . <p> Social change in the area of family law has come so fast , Liebert said , that lawmakers have not been able to keep up with the changes . <p> " We 're playing catch up , " he said . " Clearly , the law is behind the social change , and we do n't have much of the information we need  --  whether it be about the desirability of joint custody , the cost of raising children split families or how much step-parents ' income should be considered in raising families  --  and on and on .
