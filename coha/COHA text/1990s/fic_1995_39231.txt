I 'm going to tell you about the last time I went to confession . I met this priest at the nursing home where I work spoon-feeding the parish 's old folks . He noticed I had a finger off , and so he knew I was oil field and wanted to know why I was working indoors . This priest was a blond guy with eyes you could see through , and did n't look like nobody inside of two hundred miles of Grand Crapaud , Louisiana . He did n't know that when sweet crude slid under twelve dollars a barrel , most oil companies went belly-up like a stinking redfish and guys like me had to move out or do something else . So I told him I took a night class in scrubbing these old babies , and he said I had a good heart and bull like that and invited me to come visit at the rectory if I ever needed to . <p> One day I needed to . Everybody 's got something they got to talk about sometime in their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good about . I went to the old brick church on LeBlanc Street on a Saturday morning and found him by himself in his little kitchen in the old cypress house the church gives its priests , and we sat down by the table with a big pot of coffee . <p> So I told him what had been going through my head , how I used to have a 1962 Chevrolet pickup truck , a rusty spare I kept parked out by the road just to haul off trash . It was ratty and I was ashamed to drive it unless I was going to the dump . One day after Christmas my wife Monette told me to get rid of the tree and the holiday junk , so I went to start the truck . Well , in a minute I 'm standing by the road with a key in my hand looking at a long patch of pale weeds where the truck used to be . I 'm saying to myself that the truck could have been gone an hour or a week . It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So I called Claude down at his little four-by-four city jail and he said he 'd look for it the next day , that he had mote expensive stuff to worry about . Ai n't that a hell of a note . Then I call the sheriffs office down at the parish seat , and when I tell them the truck 's over thirty years old they act like I 'm asking them to look for a stolen newspaper or something . It was my truck and I wanted it back . <p> The priest , he just nodded along and poured us our first cup of coffee from a big aluminum drip-o-lator . When he finished , he put the pot in a . shallow pan of water on the gas stove behind his chair and stared down at his shoe , like he was hearing my confession , which I guess he was . <p> I told the priest how the cops searched a little bit , and how I looked , but that old truck had just disappeared like rain on a hot street . Monette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I needed something for hauling . So after not too long I found a good old ' 78 Ford for a thousand dollars and bought that and put it right where the other one was . <p> One day my little girl Lizette and me was at the nursing home together because of some **32;122;TOOLONG deal at her school . She was letting the old folks hug her little shoulders and pat her dark hair . You know how they are . They see a child and they go nuts to get at them , like the youngness is going to wear off on their old bodies . At the end of my shift one of the visitors who was there to see his dried-up wife  --  I think he was a Canulette , kind of a cafe au lait dude from out by Prairie Amere  --  his truck wo n't start , so me and Lizette decided to bring him home . We went off in my shiny thirdhand Buick , old man Canulette sitting between the two of us like a fence post . We rolled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went way back into the tree line toward Coconut Bayou . We were passing through that poor folks ' section on the other side of Tonga Bend when Lizette stuck her head out the window to make her pigtails go straight in the wind . Next thing I knew she yelled , Daddy , there 's your truck , back in the woods . I turned the car around in that little gravel road and sure enough  --  you could n't hardly see it unless you had young eyes  --  there was my old Chevy parked up under a grove of live oaks maybe a hundred and fifty yards away . <p> We walked up on it , and judging from the thistles that grew up past the bumper it 'd been there three months . I held back and asked Monsieur Canulette if anybody lived around there , and he looked at the truck and said his first word since town : Bezue . He said here and there in the woods a Bezue lived and they all had something wrong in their heads . I told him I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , but he just looked at me with those silver eyes of his in a way that gave me les frissons . I brought the old man to his little farm and then came back to Tonga Bend Store to call the deputy , who took most of an hour to get out there . <p> They sent Sid Touchard , that black devil , and he showed up with his shaggy curls full of pomade falling down his collar , the tape deck in his cruiser playing zydeco . He got out with a clipboard , like he knows how to write , and put on his cowboy hat . He asked me if I was the Bobby Simoneaux who called , and even Lizette looked behind her in the woods for maybe another Bobby Simoneaux , but I just nodded . He looked at the truck and the leaves and branches on it and asked me do I still want it . Mais , yeah , I told him . Then Sid walked up and put his hand on the door handle like it was something dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw was a lot of trash paper , blankets , and old clothes . I looked close , and Lizette stepped back and put her little hands on her mouth . The air was nothing but mildew and armpit , and by the steering wheel was a nappy old head . <p> He 's living in it , Deputy Sid said . His eyebrows went up when he said that . Even he was surprised , and he works the poor folks of the parish . He asked again do I still want it . Hell yeah , I said . He spit . He 's a tall man , and it takes a long time for his spit to hit the ground . Then he reached in and woke the man , who sat up and stared at us . He was black  --  back in the country black . He was n't no old man , but he had those deep wrinkles the old folks call the sorrow grooves , and he looked like he was made out of Naugahyde . His eyeballs was black olives floating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him what he was doing in the truck , he took a deep breath and looked over the rusty hood toward the road . <p> Finally he said , I 'm Fernest . Fernest Bezue . My mamma , she lives down that way . He pointed , and I could see he 'd been drunk maybe six years in a row . The old cotton jacket he had on was eat up with battery acid , and his feet was bare knobs . Sid give me that look like he got on bifocals , but he ai n't . Hell no , I told him . I want my truck . He stole it and you got to put him in jail . So Sid said to him , you stole this truck ? And Fernest kept looking at the road like if was something he was n't allowed to see , and then he said he found it here . When he said that I just about snapped . <p> Deputy Sid tugged Fernest out into the sunlight , slow , like Fernest was an old cow he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the cruiser and told me and Lizette to get in the front seat . He said where Fernest 's mamma lived my Buick ca n't go . So we rolled down the gravel a mile , turned off on a shell road where the chinaball and sticker bushes about dragged the paint off that beat-up cruiser . The road gave out at a pile of catbrier , and we turned left into a hard-bottom coulee full of rainwater next to Coconut Bayou . The water come up to the hubcaps , and Lizette wiggled and told Deputy Sid we on a ferry-boat for sure . <p> There 's this little shotgun shack up on brick piers with the tar paper rotting off it , stovepipe stub sticking out the side wall , no steps to the door , cypress knees coming up in the yard , egg cartons and water jugs floating around on the breeze . In the backyard was a raggy hill of garbage . Deputy Sid leaned on the horn for maybe fifteen seconds until the front door opened and a woman look like a licorice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rolled down the window and asked if it was her son in the backseat . She stooped slow , squinted a long time . That Fernest , she said to the water . She sure was n't talking to us . Sid stepped our on a walk board and told me to follow . <p> While he talked to the woman I looked in the house . All this while my shoes was filling up with water . <p> The first room had nothing but a mattress and a kerosene lamp on the floor and some bowls next to it . The walls was covered with newspaper to keep the wind out . In the second and last room the floor had fell in . The whole place was swayback because the termites had eat out the joists and side beams . Termite mud tracks ran up the walls , and it did n't take no genius to tell that the rafters was n't gon na last another year . A wild animal would take to a hole in the ground before it lived in a place like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck , and she said he was living in it . He turned to me and said , look around . You want me to put him in jail ? <p> Hell yeah , I told him , and Sid looked at me hard with those oxblood eyes he got , trying to figure a road into my head . He told me if I file charges and put him in jail , that 'd cost the parish . My tax money was gon na pay to feed him and put clothes on him . He said let him stay with his mamma . So I looked around again and saw that putting him in jail would be a promotion in life , all right . <p> Sid took off the bracelets and walked him to the house . The old lady said he could stay . Then we left , that cruiser bottoming out and fishtailing through the yard , its mud grips digging down to the claypan . Back at my truck I threw all his stuff in a pile , old coats with cigarette holes burnt through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty drawers I handled with a stick , knit caps , tangled blue jeans , fried chicken skin and bones , a little radio with leaking batteries . I put my key in but the engine did n't make a sound . When I opened up the hood all I saw was a pile of a thousand sticks and three long otter-looking animals that took off for the woods . The sheriffs tow truck brought the thing back to my house , and that was that . My wife took one look at it and one smell of it and told me it had to go . I already had one truck . <p> A rainy spell set in and the truck sank down in the backyard for a couple weeks with the crawfish chimneys coming up around it till I got a nice day and scrubbed it inside and out . Down at the home we got five new poor helpless folks from the government without nobody dying to make room for ' em , so another week passed before I could get to the hardware store and buy me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when the priest kind of leaned back against the window frame and made a faraway smile and looked out to the rose garden Father Scheuter put in before they transferred him to Nevada . Priests try not to look you in the eye when you 're telling stuff . Scared maybe you wo n't tell it straight , or tell it all . So I told him straight that the second night that old truck was parked back out on the street wearing that sign , it got stole again . I called up Deputy Sid direct this time and told him what happened . He said , you want me to look for that truck again ? I told him , hell yeah . He said , do n't you got a truck already ? I think that pomade Sid been smearing on his head all these years done soaked into his brain , and I told him that . He said , you got a nice brick house , a wife , three kids , and two cars . He said , you might quit at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gas looking for a forty-dollar truck . I told him I would talk to the sheriff , and he said okay , he 'd look . <p> I wound up at the home helping out for Music Day , when Mr. Lodrigue brings his Silvertone guitar and amp to play songs the old folks recognize . Man , they love that rusty stuff like " As Time Goes By , " " The Shrimp Boats Is a-Coming , " and such 78 rpm tunes they can tap their feet to . I get a kick out of them people  --  one foot in the grave and still trying to boogie . And Mr. Lodrigue , who has wavy silver hair and kind of smoky gray eyes , he looks like Frank Sinatra to them old gals . <p> I got through with Music Day and went out to where my car was at behind the home , and there , big as a hoss , was Sid sitting on the hood of his muddy police car . I walked up and saw his arms was crossed . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said , where it was before . I said , you mean Fernest Bezue got it back in Prairie Amere ? Man , that made me hot . Here I let him go free and he comes back on me like that . I cursed and spit twice . Deputy Sid looked at me like I was the thief . I asked him why did n't he haul him in , and he looked away . Finally he said , he 's alcoholic . That got me hotter . Like I could go down to Generous Gaudet 's used-car lot drunk and steal me a car and somebody would let me off . Deputy Sid nodded , but he said , Simoneaux , you play with those old people like they your own grandpere and grandmere . You do n't know what they done wrong in their time . I sat down next to him when he said that . The hood metal popped in and shook loose a thought in my head that kind of got me worried . It was about the folks in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was paid for that . Nobody was paying me to be nice to a drunk Bezue from Prairie Amere . I spit on the sidewalk and wondered if Deputy Sid 's as dumb as he looks . Then I thought about Fernest Bezue out under the oaks staring at the road . So I said , okay , get the tow truck to pull it in , and he says , no , I ca n't make a report because they 'll pick him up . <p> How about that ? I got to go get my own stolen truck . That 's my tax dollars at work . <p> The pot on the range gave a little jump like a steam bubble got caught under its bottom , and the priest turned and got us another cup . He was frowning a little now , like his behind was hurting in that hardbottom chair , but he did n't say anything , still did n't look . <p> I went on about how I wanted to do the right thing , how me and Monette got out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderstorm coming up from the Gulf . When we got to where the truck was , the wind was twisting those live oaks like they was rubber . Monette stayed in the Buick , and I walked up to the old red truck , and in the bed was Fernest , sitting down with a gallon of T &T; port between his legs , just enjoying the breeze . You stole my truck again , I told him . He said he had to have a place to get away . He said it like he was living in a vacation home down on Holly Beach . He was staring up into the black cloud bank waiting for lightning . That 's how people like him live , I guess , waiting to get knocked down and wondering why it happens to them . I looked at his round head and that dusty nap he had for hair and started to walk off . But he had what was mine and he did n't work for it , and I figured it would do him more harm than good to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get two hundred dollars he could have the truck . I did n't know where that come from , but I said it . He said if he had two hundred dollars he would n't be sitting in the woods with a five-dollar gallon of wine . I wondered for a minute where he wanted to go , but just for a minute , because I did n't want to get in his head . So I looked in the cab where he 'd hot-wired the ignition , and I sparked up that engine . I pulled out his blankets and some paper bags of food and threw them in a pile . Then I jumped up into the bed and put down the tailgate . I had to handle him like the real helpless ones at the home , he was that drunk , and even in that wind he smelled sour , like a wet towel bunched up in the trunk . I put the truck in gear and left him in the middle of that clearing under them oaks , him that would n't pay or work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monette in the Buick , the rain come like a water main broke in the sky . I looked back at Fernest Bezue , and he was standing next to his pile of stuff , one finger in that jug by his leg and his head up like he was taking a shower . Then a big bolt come down across the road , and the rain blew sideways like busted glass , and I headed back for town . <p> All that night I rolled like a log in the bed . I thought the weather would blow over , but the storm set on Grand Crapaud like a flat iron and dropped big welding rods of lightning almost till dawn . On the way to work I got tempted to drive back to Prairie Amere , but I did n't , and all that day I was forgetting to change bed linen and slopping food on the old babies when I fed ' em . It took me a week to relax , to get so I could clean the truck some more without seeing Fernest looking up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on the lawn , but this time I took the battery out and left it in the carport . Nobody looked at it for about a week . One morning Lizette she kissed me bye and went out to wait for the bus . A minute later I heard the screen door open and Lizette said the old truck was trying to run . She said it was making a running noise . So I went out and looked through the glass . Fernest Bezue was in there , snoring on his back like a sawmill . When Lizette found out it was a big drunk man she yelled and ran for the house . She was scared , and I did n't like that . I opened the driver door , and it took me five minutes to convince him I was n't Mr. Prudhomme , a cane farmer he used to work for ten years back . When he sat up , his left eye capsized , then come back slow , and it was weak , like a lamp flame at sunup He stared out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Fernest I ought to pull him out and turn the hose on him for scaring my little girl like he did . He mumbled something I did n't catch , and I told him to get the hell away . But he just sat there in the middle of that old sprung bench seat like he half expected me to get in and drive him somewhere to eat . Finally he told me the house had fell in arid his momma had gone off somewhere and had n't told him . Man , I let him have it . Told him to stop that drink and get a job He said that his drinking was a disease , and I told him yeah , it was a lay disease . He said if he could help it he would . That his daddy was the same way and died in a wreck . I told him he was in a slow wreck right now . I looked back at my house and them wilting camellias Monette planted under the windows . Then I told him if he could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him a mopping job at the rest home . He could save up and buy my truck . Then he put his head down and laughed . I ca n't stop , man , he said to me . That pissed me off so bad I went in and called the cops : After a while Claude come over from the city jail . How they made a gun belt skinny enough for that man I do n't know . He asked me , mais , what you ' spec us to do with him ? Claude is real country , ca n't hardly talk American . He said Fernest ca n't do nothing to that truck he can take him in for . I said , arrest him , and I could see in Claude 's eyes that nobody was on the night shift to keep a watch on Fernest down at that one-cell jail . Do something , I told him . He 's scaring Lizette sleeping out here . <p> What Claude did is put him in the squad car , stop by Bug 's cafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the town limits , by the abandoned rice mill buildings . They told me that when I called the station later on . <p> This was when the priest got up and stretched . He pointed to my cup and I shook my head . He fixed himself one more with lots of cream , got a glass of water from the tap , and sat down again , looking at me just once , real quick . <p> That made me feel like I could keep going , so I told him how that night and a couple nights more I could n't sleep without dreaming something about that no-good drunk . I mean , lots of people need help . My one-legged uncle needs his grass cut , and I 'd do it , but he says he do n't want me to mess with it . Says I got better things to do with my time . Other people deserve my help , and that Fernest did n't deserve nothing , yet when I went to sleep , there he was in my head . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture until I focused real good . But after a while he started to fade again . I settled into business at the home , putting ointment on the bald men 's heads , putting Band-Aids on the old ladies ' bunions so they can wear shoes , though there 's no place for them to walk to . <p> Then one morning here she come , in with three poor folks the government paid us to take , Fernest 's mamma , all dried up like beef jerky . She had herself a stroke out on Mr. Prudhomme 's farm , where she was staying for free in a trailer , and one side of her would n't work . I stayed away from her for three days , until it was time for Mr. Lodrigue the music man , when everybody gets together in the big room . I was just walking by to get Mr. Boudreaux his teeth , which he 'd left in the pocket of his bathrobe , when her good arm stuck out and grabbed my fruity little uniform . I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid out her tongue and wet her lips . The mailbox is the onliest thing standing , she told me . The house fall in . I told her it 's a shame , and I wanted to walk away , but she got hold of my little smock and balled it in her fist . <p> She told me his government check come in and he goes to the mailbox , then walks five miles for the wine . She said he was gon na die of the wine and could n't I help . I looked at her and I felt cold as a lizard . I asked her why me . She said , you the one . I told her he was past all help . He had the drinking disease and that was that . I pulled away and went and got old man Boudreaux 's choppers , and when I come back I saw her across the room , pointing at me with the one finger that 'd still point . You 're the one , that finger said . I laughed and told myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no black drunk truck thief that could n't be helped . <p> The priest , he made to swat a mosquito on his arm , but he changed his mind and blew it away with his breath . I did n't know if he was still listening good , but I kept on . Who knows if a priest is supposed to listen . I think you 're supposed to be talking to God and the man in the collar is just like a telephone . Anyway , I kept on . <p> I told him how after work I used the phone out in the parking lot to call Deputy Sid to help me find Fernest . I was ashamed of myself all right . I did n't know what I was going to do if Sid found him for me , but I had to do something to get the old lady 's pointing finger out of my head . I went home , and about an hour before sundown Deputy Sid pulled up , and I went out to the front yard carrying Lizette , who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's feeling bad . Sid had had him a long day . His pomade hair hung down like a thirsty azalea . He said we got to go out to Prairie Amere , and so I put my little girl down , got in the old truck , and followed him out . <p> We went through the pine belt and past the rice fields those Thibodeaux boys own , and by them poor houses in Tonga Bend , then we broke out into Prairie Amitre , which is mostly grass and weedflowers with a live oak every now and then but no crops . The old farmers say everything you plant there comes up with a bitter taste . All of a sudden the cruiser pulled off into the clover on the side of the road , so I rolled up behind . There was n't a thing around , and I walked up and Deputy Sid said , empty land is a sad thing . He stretched and I could hear his gun belt creaking . I asked why we stopped , and he pointed . Maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a little barn , the kind where a dozen cows could get in out the sun . We jumped the ditch and scratched through the buttonbush and bull tongues . Deputy Sid stopped once and sneezed . He said I told him to find Fernest and he did . It was n't easy but he did . He asked what did I want with him , and I said his mamma wanted me to check , but that was n't it . It was the people at the home that made me do it . I was being paid to be nice to them . I wanted to do something without being paid . I did n't give a damn about some black truck thief , but I wanted to help him . I could n't tell Deputy Sid this . <p> We got to the tin overhang on the barn , and ' we was n't able to see much inside . The sun was about down . We stepped in and waited for our eyes to get used to the place . I could smell that peppery-sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it 's made of cypress you going to smell that . Along the side wall was a wooden feed rack three feet off the ground , and sleeping in there was Fernest , his face turned to that fine-grain wall . Deputy Sid let out a little noise in his throat like a woman would make . He said Fernest was trying to sleep above the ground so the ants could n't get to him . He said one time two years before , Fernest passed out on the ground and woke up in blazes , with a million fire ants all over him like red pepper in an open wound . He stayed swollen up for three weeks , with hills of running pus all over him , and when his fever broke he was half blind and mostly deaf in one ear . <p> I went over to the feed trough and shook him . He smelled strong , and it took five minutes before he opened his eyes , and even in the dark you could see them glowing sick . I asked him was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mamma , so I waited a minute for his head to pet straight . Deputy Sid came close and picked up an empty bottle and sniffed it . I reached through the slats and hit Fernest 's arm and asked him why he drank so damn much when he knew it would kill him . He looked up at me like I was stupid . He said the booze was like air to him . Like water . I told him maybe I could get him in the home with his mamma , and he stared up at the tin roof and shook his head . I asked Sid if maybe his mamma could get him picked up and put in the crazy house , and Sid told me no , he 's not crazy , he 's just drunk all the time . The state thinks there 's a difference . Fernest sat up in the trough , hay all stuck in his hair , and he started coughing deep and wet , like some of the old folks do at the home late in the evening . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . That stopped me . I opened my dumb mouth just to see what would come out , and told him that Deputy Sid bought my truck and was giving it to him so he could stay in it sometime . I held up the key and gave it to him . He nodded like he expected this , like people wake him up all the time and give him cars . I looked at Sid and I could see a gold star on a tooth , but he stayed quiet . Then I told Fernest I knew he could n't drive it , and I was going take the insurance off anyway , but he could use it to sleep out of the weather like he done before . He looked at Sid and reached out and gave him some kind of boogaloo handshake . I went and pulled the truck up to the barn , then pulled the battery out just in case , and Deputy Sid brought me and the battery toward home . We moved away from all that flat , empty land , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him the car . I looked at a tornado-wrecked trailer on the side of the road and said I did n't want nothing for what I did . <p> I went home and expected to sleep , but I did n't . I thought I 'd done something great , but by 2:00 A.M. I knew all I 'd done was give away a trashy truck with the floor pans rusting out and all the window glass cracked . I gave up the truck mostly to make myself feel good , not to help Fernest Bezue . And that 's what I told the priest I 'd come there to tell him . <p> The priest looked at me in the eyes then , and I could see something coming , like a big truck or a train . Then he leaned in and I could smell the soap on him . He told me there 's only one thing worse than what I did . I looked at the linoleum and asked , what 's that . And he said , not doing it . I like to fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mamma died in the night , and I called up Deputy Sid at dawn . He went out to look but he could n't find Fernest nowhere . Sid brought his big black self to my house , and I saw him bouncing up my drive like he got music in his veins instead of blood . He got on a new khaki uniform that 's tight as a drumhead , knife creases all over . He told me the liquor store past Coconut Bayou said they ai n't seen him . The mailbox at the old place been eat down by termites None of the farmers seen him . I said , it 's a shame we ca n't tell him about his mamma , and Deputy Sid looked at me sidewise and kissed his lips like he 's hiding a smile . I told him to come inside , and Monette fixed us all a cup of coffee , and we sat down in the kitchen and cussed the government . <p> Summer come and the weather turned hot as the doorknob to hell . The old babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to keep ' em happy in the big room by playing cards and like that . I had to play canasta with six ladies who could n't remember the rules between plays , so I would spend three hours a day explaining rules to a game we 'd never finish . <p> I guess it was two months after Fernest 's momma passed . I got home and sat in my easy chair by the air condition when Lizette come by and give me a little kiss and said Deputy Sid wanted me on the phone . So I went in the kitchen , and he told me he 's in his cruiser out at Mr. Thibaut 's place in the north end of the parish , west of Mamou . He found Fernest . <p> I could n't say nothing for half a minute . I asked him was he drunk , and he said no , he was way past that , and I said when , and he said he died about yesterday in the truck . I got a picture of Fernest Bezue driving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windshield , picking his spot for the night . I told Deputy Sid I was sorry , and he said , do n't feel like that . He said we could n't do nothing for him but we did it anyway . <p> Tom Gautreaux is director of the creative writing program at Southeastern Louisiana University .
