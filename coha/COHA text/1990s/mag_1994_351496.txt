Bundled in a stark white hospital blanket , Rafael looks like any other month- old baby . But when his mother , Luciene das Dores , unwraps the snug cover , the sight is shocking : Rafael has no arms or legs . " I got very upset and started to cry when I first saw him , " says Das Dores , 23 , a part-time cleaning woman who lives in Belo Horizonte , Brazil . " When I saw him with only a head and a torso , I was devastated . I wanted to kill myself . " She could not help feeling guilty : unaware that she might hurt her baby , she had taken the powerful sedative thalidomide during her pregnancy . <P> Her story is a flashback to an old nightmare . Yes , Das Dores took the same medication that made headlines 33 years ago when it produced 12,000 severely deformed children around the world . But while the word thalidomide became synonymous with tragedy and its use as a sleeping pill was banned , the drug did not disappear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all its dangers , thalidomide has benefits that have made it an increasingly valuable medicine when used carefully . Misuse , however , has caused a grim side effect : the reappearance of " thalidomide babies . " <P> Trouble strikes when patients do n't know about thalidomide 's dark side  --  and when those selling and dispensing the drug do n't give adequate warning . Although the U.S. has strict rules governing thalidomide 's use , controls are much laxer in some other parts of the world . The consequences are now apparent in Brazil , which has at least 46 new instances of birth defects caused by thalidomide . If there are cases in other countries , they have n't received the same publicity , but given the increasing use of the drug , health officials fear that the problem will be widespread . <P> A few years after the initial thalidomide disaster , researchers discovered that the drug has an almost miraculous ability to treat complications of leprosy . Then they learned they could use it against some of the potentially fatal side effects of bone-marrow surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may help fight tuberculosis , a common cause of blindness called macular degeneration and even AIDS . <P> Brazil is one of the largest producers of thalidomide because it is home to perhaps 300,000 people who suffer from leprosy . About 30,000 of them take the drug to soothe the excruciating pain and eradicate the lesions that occur in severe cases of the infection . The only alternative treatment , corticosteroids , does not work as quickly or as completely . " The pain was so great that I could n't walk , " says Irani , 24 , a former patient at the Santa Isabel leper colony . " I almost died . Thalidomide was my salvation . " <P> Irani was lucky to have doctors who cared enough to take precautions . They administered the drug only after putting her in a hospital , where they could make sure she did not become pregnant . But some doctors give out prescriptions without telling patients of the danger , much less keeping them under observation . In other cases , the patients , who are often poor and barely literate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Greed also comes into play . Although only two companies are authorized to produce the drug in Brazil , several underground laboratories reportedly sell it to people without a prescription . Health authorities shut down one illicit operation last year , after a TV-news crew showed how easy it was to buy the pills .
