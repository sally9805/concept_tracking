I begin with what I see plainly , before and around me . There is much to curtail . To one side , my neighbors are a family , extremely nuclear in a contemporary way . There 's a mother , a father , a girl , and a boy , both children from previous marriages , the girl blond , the boy brunette , both juniors at the local private high school , both athletes ( soccer ) . The kids , Jeff and Amie , own ( that is , were given for Christmas ) a basset hound named ( by Jeff ) Spliff , a word that his parents pretend they do n't understand . A good family : Mrs. Craven runs an antique store , and Mr. Craven is a corporate theft deterrent specialist . Amie plays clarinet , and Jeff 's hair is longer than Amie 's . Spliff runs in small circles and bays like a donkey , true to his breed . When Mr. Craven goes to another town to deter theft , Mrs. Craven goes along . She says they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says instead of missing one another , they are making applesauce and lemonade , so to speak . The kids say , " Yeah , Mom , you just do n't want him screwing around . " Mom says , " That 's me , I smother , " and points at her cheek for a kiss . <p> I see it all though my sharp eyes , hear it all with my keen ears , and I 'm mired with experience , dense with unfound wisdom . Mr. and Mrs. Craven pull out of the driveway , and soon , a dozen private high school kids , along with a dozen of their friends who were kicked out in seventh grade , and a dozen of their friends from public school , and a dozen of their friends who dropped out last year . . . dozens and dozens of kids arrive . I am the one who waits until the two-foot water pipe is pulled from under the bed and passed around , and then I am the one who calls the police . I am the bitch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have nothing better to do , no business of my own to mind , and I do n't shave . You can smell my bitterness , it 's so old . When Mr. Craven does not have a business trip , I crouch in my car and wait for Amie and Jeff to sneak out their windows and hop into a van that waits up the block with its lights off . Then I follow the van to a neighboring development , and when the block is lined with cars and the house is filled with kids , I call the police on my cell phone , which I bought for this purpose and this purpose exclusively , since regardless of the fact that I am a young maid , and not an old maid , this is the business I mind . <p> I wait until the police have come , dispersed the children , and gone . Then I wait for the kids to gather at the golf course because it is not raining , and once they have set up their keg in a thicket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm having a good giggle , but I 'm serious , in a dead sort of way , because I have come to this , and , of all things , in this I believe . I know what happened to me . I became crotchety . En route to wisdom , I wizened . I terrorize with my morality . But I do take pleasure as well . <p> My neighbors to the other side are a homosexual couple about my age . They are graphic designers and work in a furnished garden shed in their backyard . In the morning , at eight o'clock , they walk out their front door with their briefcases , kiss like Europeans , and then one turns left and one turns right . Around their house they go , meet up at their shed , and shake hands . It 's such a good , old joke to them that they do n't have to laugh aloud for me to know how happy they are , how deep and ironic their ritual . When I go through my junk mail , I separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Check here for your free magazine . " I peel away my address and leave the fat envelopes in their mailbox . When their Dalmatian bitch Goody digs a hole in the Cravens ' yard , I fill it when no one is looking . I do n't want a spat raging across my yard . I do n't want the Cravens to have anything on the homosexuals . <p> Also , I experience compassion in my distanced way . Across the street lives a woman who is older than me , although no one knows it , because I have adopted the role I have adopted . I wear appropriate thick stockings and waistless housecoats . Vivian 's husband left her a year ago , and so eager was he to travel around the world without her that he allowed her the house , makes the payments , and took with him only his credit cards , their daughter , their pet cockatoo , and , it is evident from my observations , his wife 's will to survive . The bird died in the baggage compartment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eight and has yet to speak a word , flies in from places like Crete and Bangladesh for monthly visits , collecting the exotic airline stickers on her suitcase . Various breeds of men hang around the house with Vivian , sometimes more than one at a time . They sit on her front porch in their boxer shorts . They play catch with the little girl in the dusk . <p> One at a time , each man 's immoral afflictions are revealed to me . One man spent an afternoon in the yard , aiming a gun ( not registered ) at Goody , Spliff , and the front door of the homosexuals ' house . One broke a bedroom window when he was trying to open it , then told Vivian it had always been that way . One slapped the little girl when she threw a ball and it hit his crotch . One refused to use a condom . One pocketed the change from Vivian 's bedside table . It 's the sneaks I ca n't stand . There are too many people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how people get tangled up , sneaking around . If there were n't so many people , the sneaks would n't matter . They would n't tangle things up . The sneaks could sneak all by themselves . One of Vivian 's men , though , a man with a willowy body and big , marble eyes , shot up heroin on my side of Vivian 's hedges , under a streetlamp , at seventhirty in the evening . I left him alone . I admired his gumption . The rest : I find out where they work and let their bosses know . I find out where they live and tell their wives . This , if not all things , is possible if you do your research and commit the time . <p> This is my sphere of influence . I have drawn a circle around the homes , making a fine subset for my purposes . In its center , I have drawn a circle around myself . I cover myself with clothes . Somewhere , I am inside the circles , inside my clothes , seeing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the context of my role , my worldview . Irrelevant eyes are elsewhere , living in the forms of sight I 've rejected . Outside are the larger circles of the housing development , the earth , the orbits of other planets , and who knows what . If God appeared , He would be a circle . <p> When Spliff sneaks across my yard to have sex with Goody , I throw stones at him until he goes home , baying in circles . When Vivian 's mute daughter falls from her bicycle , I set her on the porch , ring the bell , and run away . When Jeff and Amie ding the car , I spray-paint a circle around it , so it ca n't be missed . When the homosexuals begin to romance with the lights on , I close my shades so that they may have privacy , although , when I 've had my nightcap already , I do allow myself to peek . Sometimes I spend the day making things for my house . I cut the bodice off an old sundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room floor with sandpaper and paint it blue . <p> I am twenty-seven , and I have been crotchety for a good three years . I moved here when I felt it coming on . It began with a fear of other people 's genitals . They are taking over the world . The fear filled me ; a city of fear grew inside me , unarticulated , a mess of fear without unity , with outdated maps and such . I was , in fact , living in a city when I articulated the fear for the first time . It was all the people , trying desperately to organize themselves into box-shaped buildings but spilling into the streets , stepping all over each other , building and scrapping , and , worst of all , when they felt their humanity at its height , humanity in the form of lust or sentiment , extracting their sex organs and producing more of themselves . <p> When it comes to genitals and humanity , I give the homosexuals a break , because I think they have promise . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not give myself a break , either . My parents have moved from this , my childhood home , to an identical house in another development , another cul-de-sac , another state . I think they had nothing to do without a mortgage . Three years , I 've come to this and remained . My parents send me money because I hate them so much . I already tried thinking that it 's time for something new to happen to me , for some new thought to take the place of my articulated fear . But I have already heard all the ideas . They 're towered in the city of my fear . And I swear , I never get over it , the prospect of cleaner space , wider spheres , consequent mass widenings of individual existences . It gets me ga-ga , floats my boats , recharges my engines when I imagine it , so I work on my scheme for reduction , which comes down , plainly , to people . It 's not the genitals as such that I mind , so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gun is not really a gun unless it 's shot , you know . <p> It 's along the lines of Jonathan Swift 's idea on how to cure hunger using sick and starving children to feed folks . People thought he was serious , but then smarter people caught up with his irony . Smarter people still , like me , know exactly what was going on . The man knew he was right , and he knew the futility created by the condition of the biologic human heart . I mean , it was a good idea , and the problem is the old one where the heart says , in this case , " You ca n't kill people , " and the mind says , " It sure would be good for those alive . " So I work on my scheme , which involves the identification of pressure points on fault lines , the poisoning of potato chips , the introduction of ravenous , rabid animals to a metropolis or two , a grand network of anonymous assassins . I 'm working it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting my self-doubt and grandiosity alternately into perspective , trying to construct a way to allow the remaining population a pure mourning , one that can not blame , one that results , finally , in cleansing . This one , this idea , after many small ones , fills my mind . I can not conceive of a better one , and I 'm currently convinced it simply ca n't be done . The weaseling I do each day with the Cravens , with Vivian 's men-the way I resort to the law of all things to clean my neighborhood-none would be necessary if I could finish the scheme . Not an easy job , but it keeps me going , and for now it keeps my great shakes in place . But truly , I confess I am not stupid enough to believe I can do a thing to help people on such a scale , especially as I am no good at networking and hold no fascist claim to fame . So I keep the scheme to the sphere of my mind , because I have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a good person , and can therefore be no more than an itch on a person 's butt , a salve on a pimple , a bane to my own existence . I 'm done examining why . It 's so old hat , and it smells up a room . <p> II . One Person <p> Which is not to say that I am always by myself , and which is not to say I never question the time I spend . For instance , merely months ago , someone knocked on my door . It 's true , I ran upstairs , afraid that something had fallen from something , but I did , eventually , discover the cause of the banging , and interaction ensued . <p> It was a fellow , an up-front one as it turned out ( I admire upfront ) , seventeen as it turned out . I invited him in , and he said , " Look , I 'm not gon na dick around . Jeff next door , you know that kid , basically dared me to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I considered . I straightened my stockings , which I wear even in the summer as part of my role , and asked him if he wanted tea . He said , " I drink coffee . " I said , " Okay . I have some here somewhere . " <p> The fellow 's name was Shannon , which as I remember can be difficult for a boy in school unless he is blessed with social acuity and popular acceptance , which this Shannon was . Good-looking in a contemporary way . Would make a pretty girl , but also played basketball . <p> It 's true , I am wizened , sullen , frustrated , crotchety , but although the world generally annoys me , I have not lost interest in it . " What does Jeff want you to do ? " I asked , hoping my smile was as wry as intended . Shannon scratched an ear and leaned against my kitchen table . <p> " He was n't too clear , really , " Shannon said . " Everyone knows what you 're like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the kind of thing , if I was seven , I 'd ve knocked and run away , that kind of thing . He 's laughing his ass off right now . " <p> " I 'm sure , " I said . <p> I was still looking for coffee . Shannon walked around the room and then said he had to piss . I could n't find any coffee , so I put water on to boil . Shannon came back . <p> " I 'm gon na take off , I guess , " he said . <p> " You 're not going to ask me out ? " I scratched an ear and leaned against my kitchen counter . <p> " How old are you ? " he said . <p> " Thirty-five , " I told him , settling for a balance between truths . " Damn , girl . I 'm in high school . " <p> He considered . Then he said , " Okay , let 's go out . I 'll come over tonight . " <p> " It 's not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the prospect of , well , a prospect , I suppose . An inkling of kindness aimed at myself , I suppose , a lightness in my old bones . <p> So then he came over that night . I opened the door to him , and he said , " Let me in quick . I do n't want everyone to see . " <p> His hair was combed and wet . I 'd taken my stockings off and dressed up the way I had in college when I went to the parties fraternities held at hotels . I 'd looked at myself in the mirror for a while that afternoon , and in a girlish way , decided I would make a pretty boy . But by the time Shannon arrived , I 'd almost forgotten my outfit , so busy had I been all evening , organizing my license plate file , which I use to keep track of people who speed on this road , and working on my scheme . <p> " You dean up good , " Shannon said , and I thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and then something happened to me for a moment , something really kicked in , calm , even poignant as I remember , a softness he culled and leant me . Then we had sex on the blue floor in the living room . <p> And that 's not all since I wizened : a couple years ago a friend of mine from college showed up on her way to visit someone else and borrowed my guest room for the night . She said it seemed I 'd grown up a lot , which is what you say to someone who remains virtually silent for an entire visit , smiling in a wry way as you talk about a variety of things that are half-heard , old hat , and immediately forgotten . <p> Also , I wrote a letter to Ann Landers once , before I knew the scheme . Only half joking , I wrote , " Dear Ann Landers , I need some advice . So what should I do ? " And I started a chain letter once , in an effort to solicit ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea to four more people , and so on . If the ideas are good we will all have good ideas ! " Someone sent me a dollar , which is illegal , so I reported it , and that was that . <p> And my folks invited me for Thanksgiving , but I knew if I went I would seem to be giving solicitous thanks in exchange for food , which I believe is underhanded . So I let them know , by ignoring them , that I was still uncomfortable with their presence on the planet , and they sent me a check for fifty dollars . <p> So it 's not like nothing ever happens to me . In fact , things continue to happen , which , it turns out , is a potential problem when it comes to settling on a way of life , or a continual sense of truth regarding one 's ideology . For instance , I was supposed to have my period about two weeks after I met Shannon , but I did n't . I started jogging . I wanted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . I went jogging with a pen and paper , so I could note the actions of sneaky people in the housing development sphere . I saw a man piss on his neighbor 's lawn . I saw a pizza guy exit a house zipping his pants . I saw a girl drop an enormous vase from a second-story window . I wrote little notes , planning to place them in appropriate mailboxes , so that people would know what was going on . But then I suddenly felt like cutting up my flannel sheets and sewing them into layered squares to make diapers . And then I knew it was about time to check on the homosexuals ; they had never disappointed me , never required correction , but I knew that if I was n't vigilant , I could not be sure . And then I felt like cleaning out the guestroom and painting it yellow . <p> In short , I felt different . I thought about how I should adjust my scheme so that only the right people would die . I had never wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't wanted Vivian to die , or her little girl , because they were so wounded , and of course , I admire wounds . I knew all this was my human weakness , and I tried , in my own way , to get over it . Trying to calm my human weakness was part of what I did when I worked on the scheme . With this new development , this lack of my period , a mere month ago , I began to find it so frustrating to work on my scheme that I cried a lot . I could n't figure out how to sort through all those people . <p> It 's hypocrisy I ca n't stand . It 's how I 'm always two steps from paradox , if not residing in it , if not allowing it to reside in me . I cried so much that soon , I did n't think I was upset about the loss of an ideological structure . I admitted that the scheme could , after all , be one in a series of ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ring true , something different . After all , I am only twenty-seven . Some people do n't get wizened until they 're old . Some people do n't at all . I wondered what I really meant by wizened . Did I mean bitter ? Static ? It is not necessary to think one thing and not another . It made sense , and felt good , to blame the tears on my newly churning hormones . It felt like something new , this unexpected lack of bleeding , a new something that I had never encountered , something of my own invention , that could not be thought up by anyone , or done by anyone else , a thing that had nothing to do with anyone else . This went on for a week or two . I felt light . I felt like a child . I felt full of potential , and it was great . <p> III . Another Person ( Myself ) <p> A long time ago , I guess it was before high school because I was still trying to find God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They shared one . Her stuff was in the drawers on the left , and his in the drawers on the right . The surface was for bills only . I found my father 's old cigarette roller , the kind with the handle you pull , and tried to make it roll various office supplies into Post-its , which did n't work out so well . Then I found a couple of chess pieces and some nail polish , so I painted faces on the chess pieces , which made them look downright demonic . Then I found my mother 's collection of fortunes from Chinese restaurants , which were old , I knew , because my father hated and hates all that is Chinese . The fortunes said that her life was going to turn out in ways it had not , not then , not now , and they told her she possessed virtues I 've never witnessed . <p> I found six photographs of our house , each taken from the same spot in our yard , right in front of the maple tree where I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I was working on a novel . I 'd been reading about Nazis , and asked my mother , " Who is our enemy now ? " and Mother had said , " We do n't have enemies anymore . The Russians , I guess " In my novel , a family would hear someone breaking into their house and whisper , " The Russians are coming ! " and for pages and pages they would hide and plot and then emerge , trying to beat the Russians back with pitchforks and garden hoes , but the Russians would keep coming , so then the family got to live in the woods with kind animals . <p> In any case , the photos taken from in front of the maple tree preserved each color scheme in which the house had been painted-six colors already-the primaries , a couple secondaries , even Williamsburg Blue when that was the rage . All these colors , and I was still just a kid , though I felt older . It was as if someone wanted to keep track of what they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if they 'd ever had it right . I remember thinking that they had n't , and that I did n't even have a favorite . They had n't ever had it right . <p> I found a sketch my father had made found a box of cherry stems , in brittle knots . Buttons never returned to shirts . Rusty paper dips . Single , double , and quadruple gummed staples that would never do a thing because anyone who can afford a stapler can afford new staples . Idiocy , everywhere . Idiocy just crammed into a decent-seeming piece of furniture , and I remember every item of it , every bit of hidden , accumulated , puerile waste . An inventory of other people 's ideas . <p> That afternoon , when I forgot I was looking for God and examined the items at hand , that afternoon stretches when I think of it and holds years of weight . A small period of time can mean years in a person 's life . A person knows only what a person knows , and time feels as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space it takes up now , in a person 's heart and mind . The time I have been living through in this house is permanent in this way , and this is why I can call myself , why I can be , why I am old . History is all bunched up behind me : what I know other people do and have done , all categorized , lumped , the facts of lives and occurrences undermined by failure , by the constant increase of trouble taking and having taken place , of lives documented , or forgotten , or both , or worse , remembered and useless . Useless ? Failed ? What on earth can I mean by that ? I mean Vivian 's men keep traipsing , the Craven kids are wallowing in banality , the homosexuals are shaking hands in their backyard . I mean , after a while , the pregnancy wore off . My period came back , innocent , saying , " Oops , I forgot , sorry , " and instantly , that new feeling , the new idea , crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a nightmare . <p> I think there are too many people , and that 's all I think . Still , looking from my little sphere with my relevant eye does not mean I 'm without memory , or without imagination . For instance , I never liked Vivian 's husband . I knew he would leave , or should , but I can see him , suited up for Safari , plainly and purely glowing , standing where giraffes knuckle over to drink , where tigers and zebras materialize from the grass as his past recedes . His little daughter holds his hand , and her first word is " Oh . " At seventhirty , the heroin addict steps off Vivian 's porch and stands under the streetlamp until , at the end of the dusk , the light bursts on and he takes in his drug , linked , in his mind , with the stars . Vivian can see him from her window , and she allows him his pleasure , tacit , pretending for its sake that it does n't exist . Her hair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the nightgown she has worn all day . <p> No one is left out when I watch my people . I can see Amie 's subtle , appropriate sneer when she finds herself sleepless , watching the television sputter and chat . She makes tea , wanders the house and the yard . The night , the insomnia , is like years for her . She converses with it : she says , " I banish you , insomnia ! " and walks it up and down the street . By morning she 's collapsed on the couch , and when Jeff finds her he pulls an afghan over her body . He 's a little confused , momentarily filled with a recognition of the vast spaces of which he 's never conceived and never experienced . The day passes like wind . At dinner , their father breaks down at the table , half weeping , half laughing at the stock of his life . " I ca n't deter theft ; ' he says . " It 's too much . It 's just everywhere . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with berries in cream . <p> In the morning , the homosexuals lay a gingham tablecloth on the lawn and picnic for breakfast . They are dressed in their suits , but one stretches out and lays his head on his lover 's lap . For hours , I think , his lover strokes his face from above . After a while Goody comes over , puts her head on the man 's chest as he sleeps , and I think it 's a family , whole . <p> A sphere , even if it is only one body wide , can be comfortable . Shannon gave me a good fuck , and I 'm sure he will give many others , and better . He 'll draw tenderness from the cluttered world and let it spill , making other people feel as I felt . The weight of the world can rise , history all fog and ghosts . I lift my eyes from the cul-de-sac and take a jaunt around my own place . Years ago , I threw a yard sale and relieved myself of the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in design or content to move . I look at what I brought to this house on my own , what space is taken or empty . I look at what I see and what I know . I think about war , how it can make a person feel half a unity , and I grow frigid with my fear . I repaint the guestroom a careful shade of neutral . I build a shelf in my kitchen and line it with empty jars . In due course Mother and Dad Craven go out of town . Amie and Jeff throw a rockin ' shindig . Kids come from all over the county , and the cops hang up when I call . They recognize my voice . Vivian slaps the shit out of her little daughter for walking in on her and the heroin addict . The girl , dumb in this country , finds the addict 's stash and mixes it with roach poison . <p> Spliff sneaks up on Goody , and one night Goody lays a litter of spotty , baying puppies . The homosexuals creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take one puppy at a time by the hind legs , and slam it against the wall of their garden office , drop each into the hole , and cover it up . <p> I am old , after all , and plenty dead . I 've barely begun to work out the angles in my scheme , ridden as it is , still , with sloppy thinking , hypocrisy , and logistic impracticalities . As it is , with nothing new , there is too much work to be done . <p>
