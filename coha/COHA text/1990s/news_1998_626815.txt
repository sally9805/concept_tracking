<p> I drew a line in the sand with my mother the summer I turned 15 . It was 1962 , and a new high school had opened in Corpus Christi to serve families in homes on the other side of town , an early version of " white flight . " Mama landed a teaching job there , a promotion from the multiethnic junior high where she 'd taught for several years . <p> I was preparing to enter high school at our neighborhood school , built before World War II , a place where Anglos , Mexicans and blacks amicably attended school together . Sometime in the mid- ' 50s , before the days of legally enforced integration , the roof of the high school on the " other side of the tracks " had caved in . The school board either could n't or would n't spend any money on it , so they made room for these students , most of them black , at our high school , which served a neighborhood of genteel weathered homes that were pretty close to those tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the option of attending my neighborhood school or going with Mama to the pristine new one . I chose to stay put , despite the pressure she brought to bear . I 'd get a better education in the new school , she insisted . I said no . She raged and ranted all summer . She cajoled and punished . I dug in my heels for reasons that I could n't explain . <p> The old school was three stories tall and had a bell tower and a verdigris patina on its old bricks . It lacked air conditioning , but it had history . It had traditions , and it had lessons to teach me . Perhaps I perceived that on some unconscious level . <p> I was part of the " in crowd " only because I clung tenaciously to the outer fringes of it , willingly participating in petty gossip and discrimination against any who threatened my precarious social standing . I was skinny and gawky , pale and freckled . I had a dishwater-blond ponytail , a flat chest and no self-esteem whatsoever . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knee of my boisterous father . I never thought about the fact that many of the jokes ridiculed minorities . I just told them , timing the punch lines perfectly , then basked in the laughter of my audience . I was a shadow person , trying to please everyone and without a clue about who I really was . I look back on the teen-ager I was with dislike . <p> I made the varsity tennis team my sophomore year . I was scrawny but athletic . The team was coed , our coach was fresh out of graduate school and terribly cool , and we traveled all over Texas . My doubles partner was Elena Vasquez , and I quickly came to adore her . She was gentle and kind , and her influence on me was a beneficial one . We were usually roommates on our trips , staying together in the homes of the host players . I envied her tawny skin and was intrigued by her crucifix and rosary , the trappings of her deep Catholic faith that made my bland brand of unexamined Protestantism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior year brought a turning point in my life . It came at a dingy roadside restaurant in West Texas , somewhere out past Odessa . We had played three days of hard tennis in bone-chilling temperatures we were unaccustomed to . Most of us had colds , we were tired of cramped quarters and each other , and we were cranky and hungry . As was our custom , we had eaten a lot of fast food the first two days of the tournament , hoarding the bulk of our allotted food budget for a magnificent feast at the end of the competition . We drove many miles , passing several places that looked suitable for our food orgy . Coach seemed determined to put some distance between us and West Texas before we stopped . He seemed nervous and somehow not himself , as did Ray Carrington , the only black team member , who recently had moved up from junior varsity and was making his first road trip . As usual , I was too self-absorbed to give it much thought . I was busy blowing my nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt on the court that day , whining and blaming my loss on my cold . We were starving . and Coach finally pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant after our wails of despair convinced him he could stall no longer . <p> The atmosphere inside the restaurant was more frigid than the weather outside . Men in cowboy hats stared with icy eyes from leathery faces . We took a table . Coach gently pushed another student away from the chair next to Ray and took that chair himself . He placed his arm around the back of Ray 's chair and leaned toward him slightly , affectionate and protective . I was consumed with jealousy . My stomach growled ; it was the only sound at the table . I cracked a joke , but no one laughed . The others sensed the situation , but I did not . I rarely read the newspaper , seldom watched the news on TV and thought prejudice was some relic of the deep South . I did n't think of myself as prejudiced and was oblivious to most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too caught up in my own teen-age angst to notice . <p> A porridge-faced waitress waddled to our table carrying one menu . She tossed it at Ray with a look of malevolence I will never forget . As the bubba-manager looked on approvingly from his throne behind the cash register , she spat her hateful words at our teammate . " The law says I have to serve you , but they cai n't make me serve these others . " She looked at us as if we were filth , then smirked in anticipation of our immediate departure . Ray looked as if he 'd been shot . Stunned , he started to rise , but Coach put his hand on Ray 's shoulder and held him still . I felt trapped between an awful reality and the dark hole of denial I always climbed into in the face of real ugliness . <p> Noise roared in my head , and I held onto the edge of the table until my knuckles turned white . I could see Coach 's mouth moving , but I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone except Coach and Ray was looking at the tablecloth . Coach kept his eyes on the waitress , and Ray kept his eyes on Coach . Porridge-face brought Ray the T-bone steak with all the trimmings that Coach had ordered for him . We sat there silently , our appetites turned to stones in our stomachs , while Ray somehow managed to choke down a few bites . It took him a long time . I do n't know how he did it . We suffered with Ray ; for a moment in time , we were Ray . He finally put down his fork and shook his head as if to say , " No more . " <p> Coach drew himself up to his 6-foot-6-inch height . Towering over Bubba-man at the register , he requested change for a hundred-dollar bill . He paid for Ray 's meal . He then demanded change for a nickel and came back to the table , where he left a one-penny tip for Porridge-face . We rose as if on cue and left with our heads held high . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , then Coach started talking quietly about hatred and ignorance . My shock over the restaurant scene , the " this can not be happening " feeling , dissipated and was replaced by the red haze of rage . The sound of my own heartbeat made it hard to hear Coach 's words . Some of them filtered through , but they were not important . The lesson had been in the showing , in the doing . I will love that man the rest of my life for what he did for Ray Carrington that day , and what he did for me.
