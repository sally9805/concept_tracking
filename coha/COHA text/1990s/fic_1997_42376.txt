He was blind and lived in a world of total darkness . She was arthritic and lived in a world of constant pain . Was there any reason to keep on keeping on ? <p> DAY after day he sat in a huge , brown vinyl recliner . He was like a newborn baby in the arms of a great protector . It was his haven , and he felt safe there . Lymon Dodson would leave that chair only to shuffle and sometimes stumble his way to the bathroom and the kitchen table at mealtimes . He gripped the rolled arms of the chair and raised himself slowly . With three short steps , he was close enough to touch the wall with one hand and the room divider with the other These were his guideposts to get himself to other areas of the small bungalow he shared with Lily , his wife of 58 years . Feeling his way to the kitchen was a longtime habit he had developed over a period of years after losing his vision to glaucoma . His world had become total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone would take pictures in the house . With his hand flat against the wall he would sometimes raise it too high , touching the old picture of a seascape that had hung there for years and always seemed to be in his way . He shifted it off center and stopped to straighten it . Their house was cozy and spotless . The living room and kitchen was one large room divided almost in half by the large oak bookshelf . All the rooms , including the bath , were painted the standard beige with matching woodwork . Lily was the creative homemaker and always enjoyed colorful decorations . The drapes were antique satin of pale blue . The blue plaid sofa showed off her hand-made pillows in shades of blue and mauve . Mature , well-nurtured plants added to the " Home Sweet Home " atmosphere . In earlier years Lily was a tall woman , nearly six feet , a couple of inches taller than Lymon and larger than most women she knew . It never seemed to bother her . In fact , she would brag about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . " Tall and big-boned , that was the mark carried by our family , " she would say with a certain pride . Now she was frail , bent , and riddled with arthritis , most of which had settled in her knees . It was difficult for Lymon to think of her in such poor physical condition . He often said that the last thing he remembered seeing before he went blind was Lily 's smiling face and snappy brown eyes . Her skin was soft and reminded him of coffee with just enough cream . Lymon had finally reached his place at the table . It was Thursday evening and supper time . Lily watched as he went through what always seemed to her , a ritual of sorts . She handed him a wet cloth for wiping his face and hands . That was easier than forcing him to take an excursion through the bedroom to the bath and back to the kitchen . He gently wiped his rich , bourbon-colored hands , lifted his dark glasses , wiped his face and took a swipe through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his red flannel shirt and checked to be sure the tail was tucked in . This was his way of feeling dressed for meals . " Your soup is ready ; it 's hot and right in front of you , " Lily announced . Lymon sat down , bowed his head and blessed his food silently " Come on , Lily , sit down and have some supper with me , " he said . " I 'm not hungry . I 'll just have a cup of coffee . " Lily stood at the stove with the cane she needed for balance and maneuvering . She leaned on it as she poured her coffee with the other trembling hand . She turned slowly and gimped the distance to the table . Resting her cane against the chair , she placed both hands firmly on the table . As she lowered herself into the chair , a painful sigh came from deep within her throat . With his usual sympathy , he asked , " Did you take your medicine this morning , Sugar ? " When Lymon called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not this time . " Yes , I took the medicine , but it does n't help anymore ! " she snapped . " Now , do n't be upset with me . I just asked . " " Ah , no matter . Soon it will be over , and this old body can rest for good . I 'm tired , and I do n't want to go on this way , " she said . Lymon released the grip he had on his spoon , and it slid into his bowl . His once-hefty appetite for the chicken corn soup began to fade away . " I do n't like to hear you talk that way , Lily . It makes me sad , and I get all depressed . " Lily 's tone was firm and her words crisp . " Now do n't you go gettin " soft and emotional on me . We talked about this , and you know my mind 's made up . We 'll do this tomorrow just as we planned it . Besides , you promised to help me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few words she spoke told him they were there , and when he reached over and touched her face , he felt the wetness on her cheek . Quickly , she moved his hand away . He shook his head in despair " I just do n't approve of what you have in mind , Lily . " " You should just think about how you 'll get on without me . " Lymon put his head down shamefully as if she were scolding him . Then a heavy silence fell between them . It was true , Lymon thought . He should be thinking of how he 'll get on without her , for she had always taken care of him and everyone . She was all things to all people in her life . Her family was her life , and now she wanted to lie down with painkillers and end it all . Lymon sat there motionless waiting to hear her speak again . But Lily was quiet . She wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron as she gazed out the window at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It was the middle of winter and the ground was laden with snow . The sun was beginning to set when it sent a stream of warm light through the window . Feeling what she thought was a false sense of rejuvenation , Lily turned her face away , rejecting it . " Talk to me , Lily . You 'll feel better , and just maybe you 'll get rid of this fool notion you have . Take your medicine and talk to me . " Her voice was shaky . " It 's not just about all the aches and pains anymore . I 'm what they call disabled and incapable , " I ca n't take care of us anymore . " " You 've been doing a fine job all these years , " he said assuredly Lymon understood her pain and frustration , but he was terrified to hear her mention the deed she was contemplating . He wanted more than anything for her to think things over again , to reconsider , and most of all , decide not to go through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nearly impossible to drive the old Buick again with her legs in such poor shape . Several months ago she had fallen and had hip-replacement surgery . The recovery had been slow with lingering pain . It was just last week that her doctor found a lump in her left breast and highly suggested that she have surgery to remove it . " I 'm so afraid , " she thought . " It might be cancer and I probably wo n't recover . " She had convinced herself that folks her age could n't keep going under the knife and continue to live normally . Over and over in her head she repeated , " I 'm so tired of struggling with this agony and so little triumph . I 've had the drugs , the surgery , and the therapy . More surgery would leave me helpless . " Lily gasped- " Lord Jesus ! I ca n't imagine being helpless like a baby and a burden to anyone . Lymon would do just fine in a nursing home , but I would n't . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burst into tears . Her frail body shook with grief . Lymon got up and shuffled to her side . He bent over and gently embraced her . Her prolonged silence had brought her back to the same painful decision . The evening had nearly slipped away . Together they retired to the living room . Lymon plopped down in the recliner , and Lily seated herself in the large , old wooden rocker . She fiddled with the remote control until the TV turned on . She clicked through the channels . " Tonight the President is gon na deliver the State of the Union message . " " Well let 's hear him , " Lymon responded . Lily watched and they both listened attentively as the President spoke on the economy , violence and education . She scratched her head in thought and began twisting a strand of her long frizzy hair which had come unpinned from the rest . " I 'm sure glad he was elected to a second term because I think four years is just not enough time for anyone to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and events that we 've seen in our time , Lily ... the coming of television , the jumbo jets , the Civil Rights Movement , astronauts , a man on the moon and ... " Before he could go on , Lily tilted her head back and closed her tired eyes . She interrupted him . " Do n't go forgettin " the most important events in my life , " she said . Keeping her chair in a steady rocking motion , her feet bounced lightly off the floor . She smiled softly as she named their four sons . " Avery , Harlan , Alex , and Lymon Jr . " Lymon nodded his head in agreement , but his thoughts stopped there . He and Lily never mentioned their dead son , Lymon Jr. , anymore ... and those times Lymon would slip and make some remark about him would make Lily feel blue . Lymon Jr . was drafted into the Army in " 66 . He went to Viet Nam and died fighting a war he neither believed in nor understood . Still they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called upon . Their remaining sons made frequent visits , and Lily was equally as proud of them . She often boasted that each had a fine family of his own and they were all good men . Lymon was feeling relieved because it seemed that Lily was enjoying the conversation . He could hear smiles in her words , and she seemed more like her old self . Without warning she aimed the remote at the television and clicked it off . As she struggled toward the bedroom , she mumbled , " I do n't want to sit here and try to live my life over again in a few hours . I 'm goin " to bed . " Lymon 's relief disappeared and a nervousness swept over him . As quickly as he could , he rose from his seat and joined Lily in their room . He sat at the foot of the bed and leaned in her direction wringing his hands . He spoke just above a whisper . " Life is precious , Lily , and suicide is a selfish thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a temporary problem . Think of all those who love you and how this will hurt them . Think of our sons and the grandchildren . Please do n't do this . Do n't leave us this way . " He could n't think of anything else to say . It was just as well because he remembered Lily 's dislike for those who begged , especially if they were n't hungry or homeless . He said no more . Lily lay there bundled beneath her comforter watching him as he spoke . She made no sound and no movement . She closed her eyes and sleep came soon . " Tomorrow will come sooner if I sleep now , " Lymon thought . He dragged himself back to his recliner . As the night wore on , he sat alone staring into his own darkness , praying for a way to save Lily from herself . He was remembering a youthful Lily . She was a proud woman-so strong with overwhelming tenacity She was the one who had brought the family through the worst years . Those were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholism . She took on the role of both parents , worked a job , looked after the children and took care of him . She could have left at any time and never looked back . Instead , she stayed and saved his life . Not once did she give in or give up . By this time Lymon began to feel again the guilt , the shame , the regrets and embarrassment . Each one took its turn stabbing at him in the dark . A programmed voice in his wrist watch announced that it was 6:00 a.m . Lymon had gone to the kitchen thinking that he would try to make breakfast for Lily . He never tried to do anything culinary . In fact he never did much of anything an ) more . Though he tried to keep it a secret , he knew when he lost his sight , he had also lost a lot of his courage . He was frightened by the least unfamiliar sounds at night . He was reluctant to venture outside the house even when he was with Lily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to go to the State School for the Blind to learn to live with his handicap and dispel the fears he had . He refused . He thought that Lily would always be there to take care of him . Now alone , he had to contend with the gas stove or the microwave and its fancy buttons and beeping sounds . When Lily woke up , Lymon was standing at her bedside . Immediately she rustled the bedcovers to one side , sat up , and took the tray from him . " I ca n't believe this ! " She was surprised . " I 've made your breakfast , Lily , " he said proudly . Lily looked down at the tray and smiled . There lay two daisies that he had plucked from one of her dried flower arrangements . The oatmeal was piping hot and dotted with raisins just as she liked it , but the milk , like a tiny white waterfall , was running out of the bowl onto the tray . The buttered toast was too brown and was splashed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He leaned forward , resting his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands . His voice was dry and cracking . " Eat your breakfast , and when you 're ready , we 'll go on with your plan . " Lily set the tray aside . Her shaking hands reached for the drawer of the nightstand from which she took a small bottle . When Lymon heard the clinking sound of the pills , his brain went dark . His first inclination was to grab the bottle from her hands . Instead , he removed his dark glasses as if he wanted her to look right into his eyes . She did . " I was thinking that I could go to that school and learn some things . I just ca n't drive that old Buick in the garage . I love you , Lily , and I want to take care of you . Give me a chance . Please let me try . " " You know , I was just thinkin " too . Maybe I 'll have that surgery and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth . Lily knew he could n't control their movement any more than he could the tears that flowed from them . She was hearing him say for the first time that he wanted to help her-that he wanted to take care of her . The sadness in her heart dwindled and her small chest heaved gently with a sigh . Reaching out , she stroked one side of his face . Lymon pressed his face against her hand and kissed it softly . Lily leaned back , smiling and remembering their love and laughter . They were young again , walking through the cottonfields at dusk to get from his house to hers . A small creek , bubbly yet quiet , separated the cotton fields , and each time they reached the narrowest part , Lymon would hold onto her hand , giving it a squeeze with all his strength . Together , filling the air with laughter , Lymon and Lily would jump across the creek , reaching the other side safely Now Lymon held out his hand to her again . Without a moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were about to jump the creek again .
