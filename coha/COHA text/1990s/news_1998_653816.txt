<p> The Government 's antitrust battle against the Microsoft Corporation has not tarnished the company 's reputation as an outstanding business that makes high-quality products . But according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll , a majority of Americans do think that Microsoft is a monopoly and that the Justice Department should continue to investigate the company and its business practices . <p> Both in a nationwide telephone poll last week and in follow-up interviews , people again and again expressed deep admiration for the accomplishments of Microsoft and William H. Gates , the company 's famous co-founder and chairman . Yet the same people repeatedly said there was an important role for the Government to play to make sure that fair play was maintained in the high-technology economy that Microsoft has come to symbolize . <p> " Bill Gates has made an enormous contribution to this nation 's economy , creating jobs and wealth , " said Richard Denoyer , a 65-year-old education consultant in Evendale , Ohio . " But you 've got to give others a real chance to participate in these high-tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to check things out , to make sure that Microsoft is playing by the rules . " <p> In the court of public opinion , the burden of proof clearly rests on the side of the Government to show that Microsoft has done anything illegal . Fifty-five percent of Americans surveyed said that they had a favorable opinion of Microsoft , while only 15 percent held an unfavorable opinion . ( The remaining 30 percent had no opinion on the matter . ) Most people said their opinion of Microsoft had not changed as a result of the Justice Department 's investigation . <p> " People give Microsoft enormous credit for what it has accomplished , but they also recognize that bad things could happen and that market power can be abused , " said Nicholas Donatiello , president of Odyssey , a market research firm that studies how consumers view technology companies . " It 's pragmatic and entirely sensible . " <p> The Times/CBS poll , conducted June 7 to 9 , surveyed 1,126 adults nationwide . <p> When asked about Microsoft 's business practices , 54 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Microsoft uses legally acceptable business tactics to sell and distribute its products . " <p> By contrast , only 19 percent said they agreed that " Microsoft uses illegal sales and business tactics to force people to buy its products and keep other products from being used "  --  a pivotal point in the Government 's antitrust case . The remainder agreed with neither statement or had no opinion . <p> Even the 60 percent of people who say the Justice Department should continue to investigate Microsoft are not necessarily convinced that the Government was justified in bringing a major antitrust case against the company last month . The Justice Department has contended that Microsoft has used unfair practices to defend its monopoly in the market for personal computer operating-system software , the program that controls the basic operations of a computer , and to try to gain an edge in the new markets of Internet software and commerce . <p> Public opinion , to be sure , plays no direct role in antitrust policy . Yet it is inevitably a consideration when bringing a major case like the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a big case that is seen as too far out of step with public opinion could bring pressure from Congress . <p> So when the Microsoft suit was announced in Washington on May 18 , Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before a battery of television cameras . <p> " Part of that exercise is to convince people that what the Government is doing is in the interest of the consumer , " noted Robert Litan , a former senior official in the Justice Department 's antitrust division . <p> Public opinion , he added , also sets the limits of Government action . The Justice Department , for example , has not moved to break up the big software company , as was done with the Bell System in 1984 and as some industry analysts have advocated in the Microsoft case . <p> " The public is not ready for something that drastic , certainly not yet , " said Mr. Litan , who is the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution . <p> People are split almost evenly on whether the Government did the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was right and 27 percent saying it was a mistake . The remaining 38 percent were undecided or were not aware of the case . <p> People who said the investigation should continue but thought the Justice Department was mistaken in filing the antitrust suit tended to view the appropriate role for government more as a referee than as a prosecutor . They also regarded some of what they had heard of Microsoft 's aggressive business practices as part of the rough-and-tumble of capitalism . <p> Dianne Tytell , a 48-year-old office manager of a dental practice in Virginia Beach , Va. , said : " Bill Gates probably did overstep a few boundaries . If you 're powerful and on top , that 's what you do . He should get the equivalent of a parking ticket for that . But I do n't think he 's really done anything dishonest . And after all he 's achieved , I think it 's wrong for the Government to try to tear down someone like Bill Gates . " <p> The Times/CBS poll does illustrate the high regard that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five times as many people have a favorable opinion of Mr. Gates as have an unfavorable opinion  --  39 percent to 8 percent , with the rest undecided or unfamiliar with Mr. Gates . The favorable-unfavorable split for President Clinton in the same poll is much more evenly divided : at 45 percent favorable , 37 percent unfavorable and the rest undecided . <p> In the case of Microsoft , familiarity breeds respect  --  or at least familiarity with its products . On almost every Microsoft question asked in the poll , the more that people used computers , the more pro-Microsoft their answers were . For example , among people who not only use computers but have installed software on their own , 78 percent had a favorable opinion of Microsoft compared with 55 percent of all those questioned for the poll . <p> The high approval ratings for Microsoft , according to public opinion analysts , owes much to the perception that the company is a standard-bearer of a resurgent American economy in the 1990 's , led by high- technology industries . " Microsoft is the symbolic company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recent success , " observed Daniel Yankelovich , the public opinion analyst . " The captain of our side is Bill Gates . " <p> Most Americans are technological optimists , according to the Times/ CBS poll , with 59 percent saying that computers solve more problems than they create , while 29 percent say they create more problems than they solve . Among computer users , 71 percent see the machines as solving more problems than they create . And two-thirds of Americans now use a computer either at home or at work , according to the survey . <p> Still , many Americans appear to be embracing the information age tentatively , if not fearfully . More than half of all computer users , 52 percent , say they have never installed a software program  --  a basic step in computing . While technology enthusiasts never tire of extolling the virtues of computers as personalized tools of empowerment , the Times/CBS poll suggests that a large share of the computer-using public has no interest in tailoring their machines or changing them . <p> The portrait of many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt on one of Microsoft 's arguments in its dispute with the Government . The Justice Department , Microsoft says , has overstated the advantage the company enjoys because the main desktop screen that users see when they turn on their machines is Microsoft 's Windows . That first screen can be easily changed or modified , Microsoft insists . <p> It can , but the poll indicates that fine-tuning software is beyond many people . <p> Microsoft 's market power is viewed with both ambivalence and pragmatism , according to the Times/CBS poll . Monopoly , it seems , is no longer regarded as an economic evil . A majority of those questioned say Microsoft is a monopoly  --  a label Microsoft itself shuns  --  but 77 percent also say Microsoft makes high-quality products . And 58 percent of computer users and 67 percent of people who have installed software themselves consider Microsoft 's dominant role in the software business to be good for consumers . <p> A certain ambivalence about big , successful companies , and what the Government 's role should be in policing them , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . <p> Consider Christopher Rogers , a 25-year-old medical student in Philadelphia , who seems little concerned by the dominance of Microsoft 's Windows operating system . <p> " Microsoft 's Windows is a great product , " he said . " It is a monopoly but not in the traditional sense of controlling markets to raise prices . " <p> Still , Mr. Rogers , like others polled , is skeptical about whether consumers would benefit if Microsoft were to control the market for software used for browsing the Internet  --  a market that is a focus of the Justice Department 's case . Only 8 percent of those polled said it would be a good thing if Microsoft dominated the browser market , 41 percent said it would be bad , 39 percent said it would make no difference and 12 percent had no opinion . <p> " Microsoft pushing its Internet browser onto the market with every copy of Windows does seem like a domineering thing to do , " Mr. Rogers said . " And I do think that 's something worth investigating . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 7 to June 9 with 1,126 adults throughout the United States . <p> The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country . <p> Within each exchange , random digits were added to form a complete telephone number , thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers . Within each household , one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey . <p> The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region , sex , race , age , and education . <p> In theory , in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults . <p> For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample it is plus or minus six percentage points . <p> In addition to sampling error , the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll . Variations in question wording or the order of questions , for instance , can lead to somewhat different results . <p> The public has positive views of Microsoft . . . View it unfavorably  --  15% View it favorably  --  55% Neither  --  10% . . . and its business practices . It uses illegal tactics  --  19% It uses legal tactics  --  54% Neither  --  2% But a majority believe Microsoft has a monopoly on computer software . . . It does not have a monopoly  --  53% It has a monopoly  --  30% . . . and many believe it would be bad if it monopolized the Internet browser business . No difference  --  39% Bad if it had a monopoly  --  41% Good if it had a monopoly  --  8% While Americans are split over the Government 's antitrust case . . . It is doing the wrong thing  --  27% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing  --  35% . . . a majority want the investigations to continue . Government should drop the case  --  30% Investigations should continue  --  60% Based on telephone interviews with 1,126 adults conducted nationwide June 7-9 .
