The Malleable Student <p> TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY feet above the streets of Ottawa , on the construction site of an office tower , a workman clambered up the side of a column form . As the sun burned down on him through the blue summer sky , he straddled the top of the platwood from around the reinforcing steel . Grasping a bar in his hands , he used his body weight to bend it . His body leaned backwards from the form , elevenfeet above the gridwork of reinforcing steel on the floor . Each bar yielded until they last . He suspended his a full weight from it and it broke cleanly in his hands . He fell helplessly from the edge of the form , landing flat on his back on the steel . <p> In the structural engineering office of Angus McArthur , I heard about the accident in the mid-morning . McArthur himself had come to my desk to tell me about the man 's plunge to the steel . He had seen other site accidents in this forty years in engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , McArthur 's project . I had been his junior draftsperson for only two weeks . <p> He growled , " All the steel laid down that morning could have been bad . Maybe only the column verticals were , or even only that one bar . " He clutched at his hair , yanking it back from his forehead . " Now I 've got to solve the problem . I did n't except this , and I do n't have time to get down there . But someone has to bloody well go to the site . " <p> I absorbed his frustration with wordless empathy . We were inextricably involved in the problem . McArthur 's sympathy for the injured man had disappeared , replaced by irritation . He had no one to send to the site . <p> Construction had boomed that summer as developers with money in their pockets were building massive complexes uniting residential , retail , and commercial construction . Entranced by these glamorous projects , I had chosen to become an engineer after the my mother had sat me down , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urged me to get a profession . I had only begun my education and was completely inexperienced when , miraculously , I secured a job as novice draftsperson with McArthur . <p> The abundance of work that had snatched McArthur from the edge of bankruptcy had also strained his small company . The demands of the jobsites kept his engineers in the field , and on this day , as usual , McArthur , myself and his wife Honoria were alone . <p> McArthur was watching me closely with a look in his eye I recognized . At a young age he had apprenticed with a manufacturing company in Great Britain . My age and inexperience now led him to view me fondly as an apprentice , able to learn any skill required . He boasted that he could teach anyone an understanding of engineering , and I was the perfect recipient . The old Scotsman had no biases - he did not see me as a girl or an eighteen year-old-student , but as a malleable commodity . <p> " I 'm going to take you to the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry lips cracking into a smile at his inspired idea . " We 'll inspect the steel placement so later you can perform inspections yourself . " <p> " I can ? " I asked , believing he had lost his grip . I knew I was too inexperienced to inspect construction . But McArthur brooked no objection . His short , barrel-shaped body headed towards his office while I followed reluctantly . Learning the followed the new skill was not a request , it was a demand . <p> In his office , we squeezed in front of his one empty table . The others groaned under unstable towers of files . He stepped over a heap of books and grasped a box full of shop drawings , the schematic plans of the steel bars that reinforced the concrete structure . A genius in engineering , McArthur was an incurably disorganized businessman . <p> As he searched through the box , I grasped the implication of bad steel on the site . <p> " If the structure is reinforced with inferior steel , it wo n't perform as it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand , how did bad steel get used ? Are n't there quality controls or tests ? " <p> McArthur scratched a persistent itch in his robust stomach . Contempt for the industry glowed in his eye . " Why should there be ? " he grumbled . " No one in the bloody industry cares . No one has to take responsibility on this job except for me , the structural engineer . No one sues the trades fifteen years later , but they 'll sue me . So I have to fix any problem someone else creates . " <p> His face florid , he continued . " You do n't know much about liability , do you ? " <p> " We discussed it a little in class , but ... " <p> " Taught by people who do n't function in the real world , " he barked " You 'll need a hat and boots . I do n't suppose you have those ? " <p> He offered a huge old pair of his boots encrusted with cement , and a scratched white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white signified I was not a laborer , not that I had to worry about being mistaken for one . <p> A roar from McArthur announced we were leaving . On the stairs down to the garage , I struggled with the large boots which oozed a disgusting dampness into my socks . I tried to adjust the band of the helmet so it sat on my head and not over my eyes . <p> Aggressively working both brakes and gas , McArthur drove the ten blocks to the site . Over his racing engine at a traffic light , I asked , " The workman fell from the top floor ? " <p> " From top of the column from to the top slab . " <p> My fear that we were to inspect the twentieth floor was confirmed . Mut , I sat beside my large boss , unwilling and unable to tell him I could n't face the job he insisted I learn . I was mortally afraid of heights . Even elevators or stairs terrified me . The instant I left solid ground , I knew only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my ears were roaring . <p> McArthur stamped on the accelerator and jolted his big green car over a curb . It lurched to a stop amidst a cloud of choking dust at the base of the white concrete skeleton . The top floor , over two hundred feet above , was lost in the sun 's glare . <p> I ignored my churning gut as McArthur introduced me around to the men at the site trailer . I shook hands with the superintendent , a short , dark man named Luck whose glossy black mustache caught his spittle as he spoke . He took my hand in his sweaty one . <p> McArthur glowed as though he had invented me solely for this purpose , " Thi is Anne . She will probably be inspecting the site in the future . " Luigi , a formworker , greeted me with a broad friendliness . The third man , who supervised the steel setters , barely acknowledged me before bursting into a voluble discussion about the bad steel . McArthur silenced the man . <p> " We 're not wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the hoist up to the twentieth right away . " <p> As we stepped out of the trailer , McArthur cautioned , " Now you 're going to meet the one person on this site you had better not offend . " I balked at the slight of the hoist and its swarthy operator who I was expected to treat with the utmost respect . The hoist was a cage that lifted us up along the side of the structure . I stood rigidly in the thing , my eyes shut tight . The ground slid away . I felt my life simple cage and the integrity of those who had built and installed it . <p> McArthur 's bellowed cheerfully , " What an incredible view , eh ? " <p> " Yes , " I hissed through clenched teeth , my eyes closed , " yes , it 's unbelievable . " <p> The cage stopped . It shook slightly in the wind , and I opened my eyes to the blinding sun and the clamor on the top slab . Beyond the structure lay a limitless view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the safe floor and paused for me , his hand ready to take mine in assistance . <p> I swung out to find nothing beneath my feet and stumbled to my knees . There was no solid footing , only a gridwork of steel laid out to reinforce the concrete that would be poured to make the floor . I struggled to stand on the bars but in the bulbous , clumsy boots , my feet slipped off and became wedged . <p> McArthur pointed his finger at the drawings under my arm to remind me I was supposed to assist him . On the ground , the air had been still , but up on the steel the wind ripped at my t-shirt and threw my hat from my head . It hit the blueprint I was unfolding with a blow that spun me on my precarious footing . I looked up to see McArthur lumbering easily across the steel . He turned to speak to me and saw me whimpering by the edge of the building . Steel setters with hundreds of pounds of bars resting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards McArthur with the lurching , rolling swagger of a drunk . <p> " Come on , Anne , hurry up . Stand where the bars cross ! " McArthur called confidently , still sure I could be trained . <p> We stopped at the wall forms set in the center of the structure where half the floor slab had already been poured . The crane was flying in the metal frame supports to hold the wet concrete for the next floor . At the edge of the slab , the foreman instructed the crane operator with large gestures as he swung the frames to the waiting crew , who dropped from the edge to grab the frames and drag them back to the floor . <p> Inspecting the steel from the slab was impossible as it was enclosed in the wall forms . " Let 's have a look at the steel in the core walls , " McArthur suggested . The aging , overweight engineer grasped the metal straps and pulled himself up the side of the form . <p> I was inside the thick , hazy atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Above me , McArthur climbed like a gorilla . My reluctant feet and hands pulled me to the top , and I stood eleven feet above the slab on a wide catwalk . I hated McArthur for intruding on my simple existence in the office . Below me , the gridwork of steel bars waited for my fall . <p> I had forgotten the bad steel that had caused the morning 's accident . I braced myself against the wide . McArthur shuffled along the catwalk to the corner of the wall and around it . I followed , sliding my feet very slowly , and when he stopped , I froze . <p> Moving with ease , McArthur had hoisted himself over the wall to a rim built around the inside of the forms . The rim was the width of my foot . He barked , " Get over here ! " <p> " No ! " I shouted . <p> McArthur yelled , " You have to get out of the way . " <p> Furious , I shrieked , " Get out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall to stand on that narrow , sagging plank . <p> His eyes bulged , watery and pale blue . He waved his hand toward the world behind my right shoulder . " The form ! " Turning my head , I saw the form dangling toward the slab . I was standing where the forms were being set for the wall . The next one was about to placed right on top of me . <p> " I ca n't move , " I cried . <p> " Of course you can , Anne . Stop fooling around and step over here . " McArthur reached out and fastened his fingers into my shoulder . " Come on , I 'll just pull you over . It will be fine . " <p> He yanked me off balance . My scream stunned him as I slapped his hand away . " Do n't touch me ! I wo n't move . I ca n't . I 'm afraid of heights . " <p> " That 's ridiculous , " he hollered . " You 're not even ten feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know it 's irrational , but I just ca n't , " I whimpered . <p> " Irrational ? " he squawked . " If you do n't move you 'll be crushed ! " <p> " Stop shouting for once and think ! " I yelled . " I ca n't move . You ca n't force me . " I did n't care that McArthur 's face had deepened to purple , or that I had just slapped away my job . <p> At the moment the heavy form stopped its delay decent a few feet above me , where it swung lazily in the wind . A shout had risen up across the slab as a workman spotted my hunched figure clinging to the wall . <p> My unseen savior produced a ladder and I climbed slowly down to the security of the slab and into a group of grinning , cheering workmen . The men were proud of their grand rescue of a women in peril . Work on the multi-million dollar project stopped as they fused over me and word of my rescue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder . He joked with my rescuers but was ominously silent with me . A young and insignificant employee , I had n't cowered before his command but had slapped him . <p> " We 'll go back to the hoist now , " he said in a low monotone . <p> I glanced quickly at the core walls " But did you look at the steel ? " <p> " Yes . Yes , I did . Before you were ... stuck . " <p> I waited for McArthur to explode and fire me . He would n't look at my eyes and his face was pinched with pain . <p> " I do n't understand , " he finally sighed " why did n't you tell me you were afraid of heights ? I ... I would never have put you in such a position . " He lifted his hand as though to touch mine , but his arm stiffened and stopped . Instead he scratched his stomach . " This makes my assignments of inspection awkward . I wanted to have you doing inspections on this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for that kind of work , " I murmured . <p> " Of course you are , " he insisted . " You 'd pick it up in no time . There 's nothing to learn , really . I could have you out here on your own in a couple of days . " He stubbornly believed I could be trained to do the job I was not suited for . I wished he would fire me instead . <p> " But I could n't come back on this site and expect to be taken seriously , " I protested . My head was wet and dizzy from the thick heat of the sun , and I tore off my helmet . Sweat dribbled into my eyes . <p> " Why ? Because of being stuck on the wall ? That 's not the worst thing that 's happened to an engineer on site . I was n't wrong in believing you could learn to do inspection . You can , but if I 'd known about your fear , I would have introduced you to the site differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my near accident , he still refused to consider my phobia a problem . He refused to allow guilt to haunt his conscience . <p> Earnestly I appealed to his common sense . " But I thought you would fire me . " <p> " Fire you ? " His boisterous laugh was deafening . " Of course not . You require training . I had to be trained myself . I was uncomfortable , too , at your age , and too full of my youth and so-called education . It took a contractor who punched me in the nose to belt some respect into me . " <p> " Then I still have my job ? " I asked with hesitation . At his nod , my heart soared . I could continue to work in the office and learn , and avoid construction sites . My heart stopped in the next second . <p> McArthur had brightened . He announced my sentence : " I believe it 's best to start you on low-rise steel buildings . Tomorrow , I 'll take you out to a two-story warehourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , you 'll be fine . The beams and joists are a little springy when you walk on them , but you 'll get used to it . " <p> McArthur truly believed that I would find swaying steel less intimidating . He had more faith in me than I had in myself . If Angus McArthur represented the men of the old system , they had been trained to be eternal optimists . <p> Article copyright Tradeswomen , Inc . <p> Article copyright Tradeswomen , Inc . <p>
