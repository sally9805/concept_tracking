The phenomenon has seemed to be little more than an anatomical curiosity . <P> But a team of researchers based in the U.S. and Israel has shown otherwise . From animal studies , the scientists knew that some odors are detected more easily when they 're flowing past nasal tissue quickly , and others when they 're moving slowly . So the researchers tested human subjects with a mix of two chemicals , asking them to sniff through one nostril , then the other . Sure enough , as reported in last week 's issue of Nature , the sniffers thought they were smelling different mixtures when they were really just getting a different olfactory take on a single mixture . <P> Why did evolution create such an odd system ? Perhaps , the scientists theorize , to give humans the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a sort of stereo smelling that could have boosted the odds of finding food or sniffing out enemies . <P>  --  By Michael D.
