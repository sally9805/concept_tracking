Michael Johnson was the reigning world champion of the 400-meter dash . Butch Reynolds held the world record . Now they were meeting head-to-head in the 400 final at the 1995 World Track and Field Championships in Sweden . Awaiting the winner was a dazzling Mercedes Benz . But Johnson was after a bigger prize . He wanted to become the first sprinter ever to win both the 400- and 200-meter races in the same World Championships . Midway through the 400 final , the two Americans were dead even . Th% 's when Johnson shifted into overdrive . Blazing through the next 100meter curve in a blistering 10.45 seconds , Johnson took command . Roaring down the homestretch , he crossed the finish several meters ahead of Reynolds . Man of Gold Two days later , Johnson won the 200 meters , completing his historic double . And on the last day of the meet , he led America 's 4x400 relay team to still another gold medal . With that performance , Johnson , 28 , has shown he 's ready to take the baton from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case . " That would solidify me as the USA 's third great superstar in the sprints , following Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis , " Johnson says . Owens was America 's first great sprinter ( see box below ) . He won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics . Yet no sprinter has equaled Lewis 's combined eight gold medals and one silver in three Olympics . Lewis , 34 , rates his 100-meter victory at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles , Calif. , as his most memorable . " It was my first gold medal , and both my parents were there to see it , " Lewis says . When the starting gun sounded in that 100 , the USA 's Sam Graddy and Canada 's Ben Johnson were first out of the blocks . Graddy led with only 20 meters to go . But then Lewis rocketed past everyone to win by eight feet . That 's the biggest 100 margin in Olympic history . At the finish , he was clocked at 28 miles per hour . Carl 's Still King-For Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track , is n't ready to pass his reign to Johnson just yet . But he has hinted that this season will be his last . Lewis is determined to win at least one more Olympic medal in Atlanta . Hell focus on the long jump , which he has won three consecutive times-an Olympic record . " I think I 'm still strong enough to jump 30 feet , which would break the world and Olympic records , " Lewis says . That would be a wonderful way to complete my career . " Mega-Hero in Europe As the world 's hottest sprinter , Michael Johnson is a mega-hero in Europe , where fans call him " Magic . " Same name as the great basketball player-only a lot faster . He can make up to $70,000 just for entering a European track meet . He even was offered $124,500 if he could break the 400-meter outdoor record of 43.29 at a Swiss track . Johnson did n't break that one , but he does hold the indoor mark of 44.63 . A Run of Bad Luck But based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnson is no cinch to win the 200 and 400 in Atlanta . In 1988 , running for Baylor University , he hoped to win the 200 in the NCAA Championships and qualify for the Olympics . However , in the collegiate finals , he pulled up suddenly . He had felt severe pain in his left leg . Doctors discovered a stress fracture . Before his leg had healed , he tried running in the Olympic Trials . But he finished last in his first-round heat . Four years later , Johnson was favored to win the 200 in the Barcelona Olympics . Weakened by food poisoning , he did n't make the final . Later in the Games , though , he won a gold medal by helping the 4x400 relay team to a world record . If he performs at peak ability in the Summer Olympics , maybe America will adopt Michael Johnson as its new track hero . Then King Carl can pass the baton to its new owner . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
