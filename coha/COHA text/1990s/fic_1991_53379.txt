LYDIA CALLED ME ten days before Christmas and said , " Daddy 's dying . You need to go home . " She 'd flown home from Dallas at Thanksgiving with Amanda , her lover , and said just being in Tyler had brought it all back . " Thank God he 's too weak to beat Mother , " she said . " I ca n't go back again , " she half laughed , hysteria threading crazily through her voice . " It 's your turn , though believe me , I know what I 'm asking of you . He ruined us on men , Louise . I can not love them and you can not keep them . " <p> " I choose not to keep them , " I reminded her curtly . <p> " If that 's how you see it , " she acquiesced , then added , distracted and angry , " If you truly see things at all . " <p> " Do n't , " I sighed , the knot of my jaw rising against the receiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You would have kept Tommy Ray , " she challenged . She has always been quick on the draw . <p> " Do n't say that , " I answered . " Please . " <p> " He 's still there in Tyler , you know , " she sang out , her thin soprano racing two-noted through the wire from Texas to Georgia . " I saw him , " she added softly , then quietly hung up . <p> " Close your Eyes , " Tommy 'd said . <p> " All right , already , they 're closed . " I was poised on the edge of Daddy 's white-painted Grumby , rocking forward , my back to the plum of the dropping sun . Tommy padded down the steps to his black pickup . The door opened and closed with the buckle of the damaged panel where we 'd slid into a pine on our way to the river to swim naked . " I 'm waiting , " I stated , holding the fiat undersides of my fingers against my eyes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he warned . He took the steps slowly , then I felt him standing in front of me . " Open your eyes , " he whispered , in the same gentle tease of words he used when we undressed together in the dusty daylight of his parents ' Sunday-quiet bedroom . " Open your eyes , " he 'd whisper , while his parents prayed in the church on the outskirts of Tyler , heads bent solemnly as they sat in the dark pews of the First Baptist chapel , most probably praying for our salvation . " Open your eyes , " he 'd whisper as he lifted the chenille-tufted coverlet , folding it back with the weight of the bedding , standing shyly proud and naked , me under the cool sheet with my eyes squeezed tight , wishing us into darkness . <p> " Open your eyes , " he whispered on the porch , urgent and secretive , tapping the toe of his workboot to the tip of my white summer pump . I opened my eyes to the waist of his dungarees , the belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hips , and above that his hard-knuckled hands , and in his hands , an orange kitten , its fluff flowering in tufts between his fingers . Its tail hung down in a sleepy vine from between his wrists . <p> " Tommy ! " I whispered . <p> " Happy Sweet Sixteen , " he smiled . " It 's what you wanted . " His teeth showed even and white between his anxious lips . " Is n't it ? " <p> " It 's perfect , " I said , reaching up for the kitten , and it came into my hands without a sound , without curiosity , limp and warm and fullbellied lazy . <p> " What 'll Daddy say ? " I whispered . <p> " He ca n't say nothing , " Tommy said flatly . " It 's a gift . Ca n't go giving back a gift , " he said , placing the tip of his finger to the white silk throat in my lap . " Nothing wrong with a little gift , " he 'd said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savannah on a bright cool day the week before Christmas . The sky thinned out blue above me , wrinkling into cumulus banks in the rearview mirror behind me , near the coast . The last half of the trip was forty miles directly inland on the two-lane military highway . That road 's a peculiar stretch , one mile the same as the next and the one before , pines and scrub brush splitting away at each side , the army 's clay-dust heavy-vehicle trails running parallel to the highway the whole length . The forestry division was burning off overgrowth that time of year , and fingers of dark damp smoke curled up from the weeds to the edge of the asphalt . Just past the turn leading into the back gates of the post , I met up with a string of army jeeps and canvas-backed trucks heading south to Fort Elgin on the gulf , their tires dropping clots of red clay against the road . The camouflaged faces of the soldiers peered down from the trucks . The men squatted at the tailgates of the personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips by the wind , their white smiles a surprise in the mottled shadows of face paint . They looked straight into my eyes as I swung out to pass them , hands fiat to the bills of their caps , a mock salute , an invitation . I could feel what they wanted . Everyone knows about soldiers . <p> " Open your eyes , " Tommy 'd said at the edge of the pond . " Open your eyes . " <p> Tommy 's father sat in a flat-bottomed boat in the very center of the algae-fringed water . " I was thinking we ought to bury him here , " I suggested , wiping my hands at my eyes . The kitten lay wrapped in a pale yellow towel at my feet . I 'd left the house without shoes and the grass beneath the trees was cool and damp under my toes . <p> " I do n't think he suffered , " Tommy said , his voice so gentle I swelled up in tears again . <p> " He 's dead now , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go on , sit in the truck . Daddy 's got a spade behind the seat . I 'll make a good spot for him . " <p> The kitten lay in the towel , and only his head showed , like some pretend baby-doll wrapped up for play . " He was just little , " I said . Tommy 's father gave a shout out on the pond as his line shot down taut beneath the green glass mirror of the water . <p> " You go on now , " Tommy said , and he followed me back to the truck , his hand at my elbow . I turned up the radio , spinning the dial from station to station , covering the sound of the spade going into the wormy earth . And after awhile , Tommy came back to the truck , his fingers muddy and damp . " It is n't right , Louise , " he sighed , dropping the spade behind the seat . " Somebody ca n't just do something like that . It is n't right the things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " You going to stop him , Tommy ? Tell me that . " <p> I let up on the gas as I passed by Brandell 's onion fields , the migrant Haitians and local blacks bent at the waist , ankle-deep in the pungent soil . They stood chopping weeds between rows , their heads dropped and covered , some in bright kerchiefs knotted at the forehead , and others in straw skimmers and old cast-off felt hats . Just past the fields , two small white crosses stood at the base of the telephone pole next to the village limits sign , where , Lydia 'd said , Joe and Paula Broadwell died last July fourth , going eighty , high and drunk with her head in his lap . On into town , signs rose up at each side of the road , local-made hand-lettered signs for PECANS , PAPAYA JUICE , VIDALIA ONIONS  --  THE ORIGINAL . The quarter-mile in from the first yellow blinker to RED 'S GAS AND PARTY-TO-GO rolled under the wheels of my apple-red hatchback like a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago to remember the name . The business district had not changed in the ten years I 'd been gone : the square red-brick buildings with their intricate cornices , the same striped awnings and unblinking windows rising up from the cracked , weathered sidewalks running east to west where the highway name changed to Main Street . The barbershop pole still wound its red and blue illusion across from McDermot 's feed store , the blue and white clapboard filling station still retained its black-faced attendant , his ashen hands polishing the chrome pumps , a lawn chair unfolded in the shadows under the thick oak to the west of the building . The NO CREDIT sign remained nailed to the tree at eye level , which all blacks knew was meant for them alone . Other customers held standing accounts . <p> I turned left on $01 at the stoplight where Kicklighter 's funeral parlor remained , gray-shingled , white shutters nailed at each window , and I drove south down the business route , south past the farmer 's market and livestock yard , past the auction grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise where the drive to the house I was born in spit gravel across the tar . I pulled in the long narrow drive and rode slowly to the circle of dirt that roped around the back of the old white farmhouse . The house was the same , standing tall and bright in the center of the thinly grassed scalp of the yard . Behind the windows Mama 's starched muslin curtains hung in even folds , white and remembered . Daddy 's rocker sat as it always had , held in an expectant backward tilt by the weight of its heavy ladderback , ghostly and motionless at the west end of the porch . Mother 's black sedan was pulled to the edge of the sideporch , its tires worn smooth . The car was the only true sign of life . <p> " There now , " Tommy 'd said . " There now , open your eyes . " In the quiet of his bedroom in his parents ' house he ran his cool palm against the swell of flesh at my hips . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always the worst . " <p> I stared at the white sloping ceiling , following down to the window which looked out on the pasture to the back of the house . " Do n't fuss , " I said . " You did n't hurt me . " The sound of my voice in his room of insect collections and 4-H awards came out of nowhere , unfamiliar , unowned . <p> " I 'd thought you 'd bleed , " he whispered , turning just then so he lay on his side next to me , running his hands in a warm wash down my soft belly , down my belly to my middle , sliding his narrow-boned hand between my legs . He leaned gently against me , his other hand working up my ribs to the rise of my breast . He raised his face to mine . The May breeze lifted the ivory curtains above the sill , over and over , the slow fabric waltzing against the screen . " Maybe that 's just for some , " he said , eyes to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on now , " he said , his fingers inside me , his body wet still beneath his belly . <p> " I could n't fight him off , " I said , the lead of my voice dropping between our faces . I turned just an inch , just enough so our eyes met , so close his lashes brushed at my cheek . " Same with Lydia , only she left after the first time . Barely sixteen and she just packed and left . If Mama knew , it 'd kill her , just as sure as that . It would . She 'd die . " <p> " Your daddy ? " he said , and he held his fingers inside me so still I stopped breathing a minute . " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , " he said . " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph . " And then he was quiet , pulling his hand from my wetness , his damp and bloodless fingers coming up to my face , my scent against my own lips . His tears met my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay there with his arms at my shoulders , crying . Inside I was nothing but air . <p> The moment my eyes fell on my father 's face , I knew that he did n't have long . Mother ushered me through the parlor , her hand at the small of my back , nervous , light , and uncertain . We passed from the quiet bright parlor into the dark of their bedroom , and she stood behind me , chattering , working her hands at the waist of her flour-bag apron , then up at her temples , fingering the steely gray spit curls . Daddy took one long look at me , then he lifted up on one arm in the bed , his other arm flagging out from his shoulder , wild and spastic and feeble . " Get that cow out of my house , " he cried , his voice newly thin and whistling with his illness . There was no flesh left between his skin and his bones , only reminders of knotted and angry muscles and the cables of withering tendons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Daddy , look here at Louise . She 's lost weight now , and look how she 's dressed so pretty , and all for coming to take care of you . Daddy , tell her you 're glad she 's here . She 's got a leave from the bank to come tend to you . Daddy , it 's been so long , now . It 's your Louise . It 's your baby . " <p> " I know a whore when I see one , " he coughed , choking up beads of phlegm , then he spat in a tin cup on the nightstand . " Get her out of my house . I ca n't abide a slut in this house . " <p> I stood in the warm dark bedroom and breathed the air of his sickness . I stood in the room I 'd been conceived in and stared into the blue water of his eyes , his pupils wild and large with morphine . " I 'm here to help my mother , " I stated . I kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bed and faced the rose-garden wallpaper . " You 've no say in the matter , " I stated . " No say at all . " <p> Each morning I woke before Mother , stirring surprised in the bed I 'd known when I lived in that house as a child . I 'd rise early to the sound of semi-trucks as they passed our drive pushing into the final stretch before Florida , to the sound of the glossy bold crows in the spires of the pines out back of the house , to the vibrating chatter of smallbodied birds in the bushes beneath my window . I 'd make breakfast while still in my robe , wearing nothing underneath , the breath of the house passing cool against my breasts as I stood solidly at the linoleumcovered counter , the pattern of gray and red and black and yellow squares faded and bubbled with age . Mother had found fresh mocha java beans at the Red and White , and my delight at her purchase of two pounds of my favorite coffee reflected off her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us too quickly and never repeated itself . <p> I ate breakfast each morning in my father 's chair at the thick-legged kitchen table , slowly , indulgently , even as he began calling for assistance , and then I would bathe in the old porcelain tub upstairs while Mother began the rituals of caring for her dying husband . After dressing I helped her unwrap the gauze at his ankles , rubbing cortisone cream into the maps of ulcers , and he kicked at my hands when I touched him . He swore that I hurt him , that I watered his liquor , his head propped up on the saliva-stained pillows , his cheeks spidered purple , his eyes rolling , slow and golden with jaundice . <p> He sucked on his gin till the end . Mother nursed the liquor in through his dark swollen lips , tilting the spoon against the cracked and bleeding split of his mouth , even when he could no longer eat for vomiting . The work wore her out , made her thin , made her cry . I 'd hear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running in the downstairs commode , the low gentle sound of her words rising up through the floorboards , the grating of the small rocker as she pulled it up close to the bed . I said she should just let him die . She said I must not know how it is when you spend your whole life with one man , and I said she was right , that I did n't . And I knew she would n't last long without him . <p> Daddy died New Year 's day as Mother was bathing him . I came into the room with fresh towels , and his face was turned toward the door , his eyes open and fixed on nothing . I could not bring myself to touch him . I held mother gently as she moved in peculiar calm , bathing him that final time , working the rag against the yellowed bar of soap in the metal wash basin . I felt nothing but curious distance as she lifted him forward in her arms , so thin he seemed made of nothing as she pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his flaccid white belly , the winged bones of his hips , pulling the adhesive tape from the catheter . His genitals lay small and nestled between the death of his powerless legs , a shrunken souvenir . At last she folded his arms at his chest , and ran the tip of her finger the width of his wedding band , then up to his blind eyes , pulling the lids gently down . And then in the quiet morning , we stood , one at each side of the four-posted bed , and we lifted the sheet to his chest . I had thought we would cover his face , but Mother paused briefly , hesitant , her tongue at her lips . " Daddy , " she said . " Daddy , may death be a happier place . " <p> I stayed on for a few days after the funeral then had to go back to my job at the bank in the city . The morning I left , Mother promised to come see me in June . " Wo n't that be nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in my car . She stood at the front of the house as I drove off , lifting her arm once in a small gentle arc of good-bye . Early that spring , when the ground soaked up rain , Lydia called in the middle of the night and told me Mother 's heart had given out . I was n't surprised . <p> I went home to Tyler to tie up the estate , and I slept with the lawyer , a dark smiling man I remembered from the high-school debate team . He lifted my breasts to his lips as we lay in my bed upstairs at the back of the house . He said , " Why do n't I remember you from school , Louise ? I 'd remember a girl like you . " I told him I 'd been disguised by my fat , and that fifteen years was an awfully long time , time enough to forget someone like me . Then I told him to remember me now as I kissed my way past his navel , and he trembled against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . <p> I hired a man out of Reidsville to come auction the things I chose not to keep . I did not want the vinyl recliners , the colonial sofa , the dishes , the drapes , or the tractors and tools in the barn . After the sale the auctioneer stood in the quiet dark house and said , " Louise , with just the antiques here it 's really quite nice . " I smiled and took off my coat then unbuttoned his shirt , running my hands through his curly blond hair to the back of his tender neck . It was my house now . <p> I 'd never intended to come back to Tyler to stay . When I 'd left I had said I would never come back , but that 's what all fat girls say when they race to the city fresh out of vocational school to snatch up a job in an office or bank . That 's what all girls say when they pile their hair on top of their heads and look in the mirror and see Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined them and beat them , and the closest they 've ever felt to freedom is letting some gentle , tall , pimpled boy work his fingers down into their pants . <p> I kept telling myself I 'd go back to the coast in a week , maybe two . But the lawyer called up every morning , driving out after lunch , and the rain kept coming down , night after night , beating into the roof of the house as I slept , exhausted from afternoon bed-play . The storms finally dropped off into drizzle and mist , then after two weeks I woke up to sunlight , the sky stretched tight and wide and blue all the way to the horizon . The lilacs swelled open in Easter purples , wagging on branches under the windows , and the farmers came out , pulling their shirts from their shoulders as they struggled in the fields . They turned their pale naked backs to the sun as they dragged plows behind their tractors , tilling and turning the clay-pink soil , and I stayed . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living asshole-to-elbow . This is too good to let go . <p> I lived in the house with two heavy Blue Persians named Asia and Africa , who still had their balls . My men friends said , " Lou , you should get those cats fixed . That 's why they keep running off , do n't you see ? " I pushed a cool hand down the front of their pants and said , " Maybe someone should do that to you . " The cats wandered off , but they always came back . Done in . Hungry . Wanting canned salmon . <p> When Mother was living she had always kept dogs , collies and shepherds with dark grapes of ticks at their necks , dogs whose piss burned the edges of bushes and dried in streaks on the trees , the stink rising up after rain . I took the last one off to be shot when Mother died , paid twenty dollars to have it done . The owner of the filling station knew someone who 'd do it , but still he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep pets I do n't love . <p> In May I took a job uptown at Danner 's department store , and the women I worked with said , " Do n't you get bothered out there at that farmhouse , all by your lonesome and all ? " I said , " No , I have cats . " And I had my men friends , but I did n't tell them that , did n't tell them how many or why I could smile all day , how sometimes it was all I could think of while lining up testers of perfume on the glass countertop or trying a lipstick on a customer 's wrist . Some secrets should not be divulged . <p> Most of my men friends did not like my cats and complained they left hair on their clothes , said they 'd leave fleas in the bed . ! told them I kept my cats clean . They said , " Look how they lick themselves , " as the cats curled forward at the foot of the bed , spreading their legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like me to do that to them , and I did . <p> I worked in cosmetics at Danner 's , a position I valued but did n't need . I could 've lived years on the money that Daddy had left behind , squirreled and invested and holed away , kept from us all by sheer meanness . But the job gave my life order and it helped me meet men . They came into Danner 's to shop for their wives , for their girlfriends and mothers , and ! knew just the ones I could catch . They came to my counter looking for something to patch up a fight , something just right for a birthday , some little expensive sweet something or other . They never knew what they wanted . I showed them bath oils , Opium dusting talc , Chanel No. 5 , glittering body-mousse  --  " for that special occasion . " When they asked in confusion what scent I preferred , I 'd lift the hair at the nape of my neck , bending just so across the glass counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'd tell them , " Smell . " With their breath at my skin , I 'd lift my eyes from the mirror to the pale planet of their faces . " Obsession , " I 'd whisper , the very first secret between us . <p> There in the dark of the tobacco shed , there in the shadows and light that split through the missing shingles , that 's where it happened the first time . Daddy said , " You ai n't strong enough to stop me , do n't try , and maybe you 'll even like it , look at your face , do n't tell me this ai n't nice . " Three years later , Tommy was nothing new . <p> Lydia and Amanda drove out in August to pick up some things in their van . I 'd promised them a pie-safe , six pressed-back chairs , and the cradle Lydia and I had both used as babies a lifetime ago neither of us could or chose to remember . Lydia laughed right out loud when I explained in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and said perhaps they could borrow a man for a night or two , seeing as I had enough to pleasure myself , and then some . " We 're thinking of starting a family , " she said as she stood and washed dishes at the sink in the kitchen . Lydia stood to her left drying plates , and she put her hand on Amanda 's wrist , tilting her head . Then Amanda said , " Oh , go on , you can tell her . You 're sisters . Sisters can talk about these things . " <p> Lydia turned and looked over to where ! sat at the kitchen table , sorting out the glossy pages of coupons from the Sunday edition , cutting along the dotted lines with Mother 's best scissors . She 'd been with Amanda for seven years , ever since they met back in college . I knew right away they were lovers the first weekend I went to visit them both in their apartment in Statesboro back of the student union . Lydia had n't needed to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she 'd wanted to tell me , and she 'd cried when she 'd said , " We 're together , you know , " like nothing else ever in her life before had meant so much . And I 'd hugged her to me then , just like we 'd hugged in our bed those dark nights , trying somehow to save ourselves , trying somehow to stop the shaking world we could never control . <p> She looked at me there from the sink , tall and red-haired like me , but with her hair cut short on the right , tumbling long down her left cheek , with Daddy 's thin , mean body caught inside her , padded with breasts and hips . Amanda was short and dark with a heavy bosom and plump childlike legs . " Amanda has fits that her biological clock is running out , " Lydia smiled , running her fingers through Amanda 's thick tangle of hair . " And I 'd like a family , " she added as she piled the plates in the cupboard . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said softly , placing her palms flat against the counter with her back to . me . <p> The day they left to drive back to Dallas the house rose up empty around me . I fretted through the silent rooms all morning , pulling the sheets from the beds , running a wash , filling up time . At noon I decided to make up some chowder and I drove into town to the IGA . Shopping is something ! like , wheeling along the aisles like a regular somebody , thinking thoughts about food and my men and sometimes thinking on nothing . I was there at the produce counters , ice wedged in between the celery stalks and broccoli , when I looked up and saw Tommy Ray . <p> He was standing at the end of the aisle , next to a display of cereal boxes . Debbie , his wife , had her back to me , bent down and talking to two blond-haired boys , saying , " We 've got two boxes at home you have n't finished yet . " Tommy was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my face , and he never looked away . It 's funny how Debbie looked up just then , funny how she looked quick to Tommy then me , and then back to the boys . <p> I held both hands on the red plastic bar of the grocery cart , moving through the six feet between us like I was making some commercial for television , smiling so perfect my heart could stop . " Well , hey , " Tommy smiled , moving two steps to meet me . " I 'd heard you were back . " Debbie smiled as my cart nosed against theirs , her lips lifting up brightly and too quickly , a hand laid to each boy 's head as she moved closer to Tommy . <p> " I guess everybody still makes it their business to know everybody 's business in Tyler , " ! smiled , my face going all hot in a flush of blood . <p> " Now , do n't you look pretty , Louise , " Debbie said , tossing her hair nervously around her thin face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding band . " You have certainly become a citified woman . Savannah must 've treated you right . Do n't she look nice now , Tommy ? " she spoke all fast and sweet . Tommy pressed his lips together , smiling and nodding and wordless . <p> " Thank you , " I said . " Your boys are so handsome . They look just like their daddy , " I added . <p> " You going back to the city , Louise ? " Tommy asked . <p> " There 's no telling , " I answered , regular and even , like my heart was n't due to fly out of my chest . Then he smiled at me and I smiled at Debbie , and I turned and pushed my cart back through produce , leaving it off at the bakery at the front of the store . I sat in the car in the parking lot , turning the air on my face , swallowing down something that felt like tears , thinking just once how Tommy had cried out my name with his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tommy 'd said . " We 've got to talk about this . Lying there with your eyes all screwed shut wo n't help . " <p> Tommy lay half on top of me still , our legs damp and warm with sex . " Let 's just go off somewhere , " I cried . " Let 's just get out of this place and go somewhere no one knows us , " I begged . <p> " People get married at seventeen , " he Said . " We do n't have to feel so scared , you know . It 's not like we do n't love one another . I love you . Does n't that count ? " <p> Outside his bedroom window the winter rain had iced the trees in the backyard . " We got till June to finish school . " <p> " We could go nights to those special classes , " he countered . " I could go to full-time at Wadell 's . " <p> " Where we going to live ? " I sighed . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should 've known . <p> Then I laughed . " Tommy Ray , you mean living here with your parents , sleeping as man and wife right over their heads ? " <p> " I guess , " he grinned . <p> " You 're a spoiled only child , you know that , do n't you ? " ! said . " And what will your parents say ? " I asked , and he lifted his chest above me in a shrug . " It do n't matter what they say , " I stated . " We 'll be dead , anyway . My daddy 's going to kill us both . " Tommy 's face went slack next to mine . " That 's the truth , " I sighed , and Tommy held me tight against him . <p> September was unusually hot that year , and it made me go restless inside . Work kept me only half-occupied , so ! decided to start on the house . I called in a crew to plaster the ceilings and scrape off Mother 's old wallpaper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed from the front of the house to the back , and I set a black leather sectional sofa alongside the parlor windows . Then , on my thirty-fifth birthday in November , ! met Jacob , a roofer from Statesboro , and for the first time since Tommy I let myself go when he touched me . I knew what I wanted when he came inside me , and I narrowed my boyfriends to three . <p> Jacob also owned land and rented out properties , and that 's how he said he was spending his time when he came out to get me at night . We 'd drive out of town with the wind whistling in through the windows , speeding down the coast to Brunswick , or over the bridge to Hilton Head . He drove a Lincoln with dark-tinted windows , windows you could n't see into , a car full of gum-wrappers , hairbrushes , baby seats in the back , remnants of life with his family . He ran his hand up my thigh as we sang to the radio , talking about where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we eat in or get takeout . He loved Chinese so I loved Chinese , too , and we 'd eat in the car out of white waxy cartons . <p> Sometimes we went to Savannah and parked down on the riverfront , then we walked till our feet hurt , finding bushes and alleys and places to kiss on Oglethorpe Square , and he 'd say , " I 'm young again , Louise-baby , young . " Sometimes we never made it out of his car and did it right there in the seat just like some kind of teenage dream , looking out at the boats passing in and out of the rivet 's mouth . <p> Jacob 's last name was Talarino , and I called him my " Italian Stallion , " took him in my mouth and said , " This is my own special pasta . " One night I straddled his hips and moved real slow to the song on the radio , rocking him close in my arms . He said I sure knew how to move . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he swelled up inside me so hard that he moaned , holding so tight he left marks on my hips . When I showed him the bruises he said I was just like a peach , and he pressed his lips to each blue blossom he 'd left on my skin . <p> Craig liked my cats , but he would n't admit to it , calling them " Stupid somethings , " tossing them pieces of shrimp as we sat eating naked in bed at dusk . We sat on the porch and I 'd brush their hair in the moonlight , saying , " See , are n't they pretty ? " And he called me his Mistress of Cats . He was young , twenty-two , and he had his own trawler , shrimping the coast , coming inland to see me the nights his wife did their books . He 'd come to me smelling of sea salt and fish guts and kissing me into silence . Early in December the breeze blew in warm from the coast , and he took me fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes and swam naked where the river ran clear and strong over the sandy bottom and smooth stones . He talked to me from the riverbank , telling me Burt Reynolds had made a movie and filmed part of it right there , did I know that ? Told me that they should make a movie of me standing like I was , waist deep in the water , as he unzipped his jeans . He said he was too young for someone wise as me . I walked up the grassy incline to where he stood ; then he said nothing at all as I pressed my wet body against him . I took his hands and showed him what to do . He came like a flash inside me . " Not too young for what I need , " I told him . <p> Later that week Eddy Jo drove out right after church on a Sunday . He was peevish and mad at his wife for letting her mother move in with them , putting her up in the bedroom right next to theirs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the kitchen , one I had hinted would grow like a weed by the bay window he 'd paid to have put in . The cats sniffed around the soil in the pot and bit gently at the leaves on the lowest branches . Eddy Jo lifted my robe to . my waist , his hands to my hips , and I leaned back against him , saying his name , right there in the kitchen as I filled the teakettle at the sink . Then I whispered , " ! want you inside me , " and we dropped like that to the floor , touching the whole way down , the cats purring and winding between us . In the bright morning light on the small braided rug , I felt him burst loose with his seed . <p> Halfway to February I knew I was pregnant . I had been pregnant before . But this time there was no father to whip my back into bleeding behind the shed , no old drunk to bust my jaw with the back of his hand or to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tied in my womb . <p> Tommy 'd said , " Baby , what 's he done to you ? Baby , Jesus , what 's he done ? " Daddy blew out the windows of Tommy 's truck with the shotgun he kept by his bed , and after a while Tommy signed up and went off to Fort Benning . Nobody had to ask why . <p> Jacob paid for me to see the doctor in Reidsville , a man that he rented an office to . He was a young Jewish doctor from Chattanooga who said all his life he had dreamed of practicing in a small town , family doctoring , like it used to be . He was blond and blushed easily , but he never once asked was I married , only talked to me about my age . He weighed me every other week and prescribed vitamins , saying thirtyfive was n't old at all and that I only looked about twenty-five or - six at that . He 'd asked my first visit as I lay there with my feet in the stirrups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud . " Completely , " I told him , and he nodded and said , " That 's nice to hear , then . " <p> Craig took me shopping on Valentine 's Day , saying it was the least he could do . We drove to the mall in Savannah , and he smiled real watchful and kind as I modeled jumpers and tops that fanned out at my hips . On the way back to Tyler we drove past the trailer park where he lived with his wife . He pointed out their trailer to me , and said , " Do n't you ever get jealous about her ? " He laughed short and fast when I shook my head . He put a cigarette in his mouth and said , " I do . " <p> Eddy Jo asked first if he was the father . I told him fiat out that I did n't know , did it matter ? " No , I do n't suppose so , " he sighed as the winter wind swept past the trembling dark window , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You listen here , " I said , taking his hand , and I placed it palm down on my stomach . " This is my baby . Mine . You can share if you like , but if you get ugly , it 's over . " <p> " What are they like ? " he asked , rolling back toward me . " The others . What are they like ? " <p> " Like you , " I whispered . " They 're kind and good and lonesome . They say that they need me . " <p> " Like me , " he agreed , and the baby turned right then , rolling in a fist under my tight skin , right against Eddy Jo 's hand . " And you ? " he said then . " Do you need me ? " <p> " I do n't need anyone , " I answered softly . Then I thought for a minute . " I chose you , " I said . " It 's a matter of choice . " <p> In May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of mean around there , what with me showing and no genuine father in sight . My men friends were happy with that , and they all said I needed to rest . I put in a garden at the end of the month , turning up grass with a hoe in back of the house by the shed , setting in snap beans and summer squash , good food , food to grow babies by . I let myself freckle and my hair went light as I worked in the yard , and on warm afternoons I sat on the porch in Daddy 's rocker , my belly all round in my lap , and I embroidered flowers and bunnies and butterflies down the front of tiny sweet wrappers . In July I painted my childhood bedroom , rolling butterpale paint on the walls , then Jacob came out and ran wallpaper strips at the ceiling , in a pattern of bees and honeysuckle vines he 'd picked out himself . Craig built a unit of shelves next to the window , including a fold-out shelf for changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fit of pride . <p> I grew heavy as the baby stretched out from under my breasts to my bladder , and I napped with the cats all day long , waking at noon to fix lunch certain days for Eddy Jo , going out late in Craig 's truck for liver and onions at a truck stop out of town , where I looked just like anybody having a baby , not necessarily unmarried . It was hard to find comfortable positions to sleep in at night , and the cats pawed around me as I tossed back the covers and propped up my legs . But the days were long and lazy , and my men friends stayed till I was sleepy enough to fall off , rubbing lotion into the swell of my stomach , rubbing my back as I drifted off in the room where my parents had been man and wife , in the room where my father had died . <p> In the middle of August Asia ran off . I called out his name from the porch most of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia . After supper I 'd sat in the rocker outside and combed out Africa 's snarls , his fur shining and dense under my fingers . The moon was a perfect curved sliver by ten , and I stood on the steps and called for the cat when I felt the warm squeezing trickle between my legs . The baby fluids seeped through my clothes as I walked back into the house and gathered my suitcase and sweater . I filled the cats ' bowls with food and water for Africa , propping the basement door open so he could get to his litter box . I could have called my men friends , left a message with someone , maybe let them know it was time , but placing my bag in the back of the car , I decided against it . I 'd call them later , ask them to look out for Asia , tell them the news of the baby . Under the dark sky netted with stars , as I drove out of Tyler on $01 , past the diner , past the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just last week , I was strong and heavy with happiness . <p> The labor went slowly at first , and the doctor remained at the hospital on a bed in an empty room . By morning I moved into the throes of labor , begging the nurses for water and crying out for my mother , and once I believed she was there . It took eighteen hours to get me into the delivery room , and in between contractions I thought of my men friends and what they were doing right then , of their eyes and their wet gentle kissing . <p> We went home four days later to the house I was born in , Alicia blinking and blind in the sunlight of Eddy Jo 's car . We went home to my house , and Asia was waiting there , hungry and tired , with matted hair . <p> The cats like to sun in the nursery windows , and they purr in the warm summer air as I sit rocking Alicia , her lips clenched to my thick nipples . When the baby naps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose at the front of my gown where my milk has wet the bodice . " That milk 's for baby , " I chide , running my fingertips down the silk of their tender throats . <p> In the evening at dusk , the men come out , one at a time , taking turns through the last weeks of summer . They bring me fresh milk and gifts for the baby  --  rattles , small flannel blankets , tiny socks with lace at the cuffs  --  the pink little gifts men pick out . We sit on the porch in the shadow of Daddy 's rocker , watching the air go violet with night as the swallows scatter between the barn and the shed , while Alicia tugs at my breast . She makes the smallest noise as she suckles , and we hold our breath just to listen . Sometimes I call for the cats and I bring out the brush , pulling tangles and knots from their coats so carefully they do n't even feel it . Then the men hold the baby , turning her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a nursery rhyme , and look for a sign she is theirs . <p> <p> By PAULA K. COVER <p>
