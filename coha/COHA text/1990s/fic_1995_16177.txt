Parker looks like a different man from the one we saw in V.R. His face is hard , creased by pain and disappointment . His hair longer . His ear pierced . His eyes flutter as he comes to consciousness . Turns his head to look at John . John looks the same as he did in V.R. , but he 's being wracked by violent convulsions . &nbsp; PARKER ( barely functional ) There 's a problem here . You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs flail .

The big head looks immature , unformed.  --  63  --  The beams cross , and the two essences interact , an oddly violent act , like two macrophages putting out pseudopods , engulfing , then re-emerging ( probably mostly 2-D effect )  --  a single , combined symbolic trait . The Swastika . It emerges from the other side of the beam , multiplies and attacks the large immature head like scores of viruses . They surround it and merge , and an altered , more formed head emerges ( probably lock down VR camera and 2-D morph . ) The " FITNESS MAP " increases , " NET STATUS " shows more complexity , " TRAINING DATA " is some Nazi propaganda ( play some Wagner here ? ) etc .

Lindenmeyer had to grow him up , psychologically , like a real person with multiple personality disorder . The program learns like a child , but much faster , rewriting itself , evolving .
