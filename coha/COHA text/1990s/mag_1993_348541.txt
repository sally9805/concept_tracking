What will $7,000 get you ? <P> A Concorde round trip , New York-Paris , plus cab fare . <P> A frock from Christian Lacroix . <P> Ten months of expert baby-sitting at a Manhattan preschool ( mornings only ) . <P> Less than one second of Steven Spielberg 's summer epic Jurassic Park . <P> Or El Mariachi , the new year 's most entertaining movie and sweetest surprise . <P> Robert Rodriguez , the film 's writer , director , co-producer and editor , describes his action comedy  --  about a singer-guitarist mistaken in a Mexican border town for a killer who totes his artillery in a guitar case  --  as " a taco Western . " We 'd call it a rough , funny Mad Mex . Now all Hollywood is calling Rodriguez because Columbia Pictures is distributing his movie . Not bad for a 24-year-old who raised nearly half the film 's budget ( okay , $3,000 ) by serving as a " lab rat " in a medical-research project in his hometown of Austin , Texas . <P> How nice , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those . And thrifty too . Rodriguez , the third of 10 children of a nurse and a sales manager for a cookware firm , does seem an exemplary gent . To impress on his younger siblings the value of an education , he has resolved to take the last three courses he needs for his University of Texas degree . But goodwill does n't make a good film . And one of El Mariachi 's zestful pleasures is that you can enjoy it without awarding it affirmative-action points . It 's a real movie , high but not woozy on its own cinematic verve , and Rodriguez is the goods  --  not just for what his career promises but for what his film delivers . <P> The plot is familiar : a gentle stranger ( Carlos Gallardo , who also co- produced ) in a tough town ; a mysterious woman with a nasty patron ; and in 82 minutes , 15 perforated corpses . But that 's just the outline . Rodriguez , who 's been making films since he was 12 , and whose short comedy Bedhead won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get tired if there 's no wit and bustle in the execution . His mentors  --  Alfred Hitchcock , Sergio Leone , Sam Raimi  --  knew how to do it , and Rodriguez is a fast learner . Every shot ( of an astounding 2,000 in the movie , about four times the average ) is an aerobic workout for the eyes  --  a delirious too much of a muchness . <P> To Rodriguez , this calculated hysteria is an expression of family values . " That 's the way it was in my family , " he says . " Kids were always running around all over the place all the time . That 's what things looked like to me . " But really , the movie 's script and style were born of necessity . Rodriguez built the screenplay around the assets available to him for the 14- day shoot in Acuna , Mexico : a hotel , two bars , a school bus , a motorcycle and a pit bull . All became elements in the story  --  plus a turtle found on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexican videophiles and added a strong female character just to twit them . " If I thought a lot of people were going to see this , " he says , " I would have changed a lot of things that people ended up liking . "
