<p> Lawmakers in the last Congress worried that the Capitol was awash in special-interest money . This year , those complaints have virtually disappeared . Instead , members of Congress are muscling special interests so hard that even lobbyists are complaining . They charge that many lawmakers are demanding contributions before they 'll meet with them or address their clients ' problems . <p> They 're offended by threats from House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders that doors will be closed to lobbyists who continue to give to Democrats . <p> Some say they are simply broke , tapped out by a stampede for money that began 24 hours after Election Day . <p> Yet lawmakers are so loath to take no for an answer that some lobbyists are resorting to voice mail to screen them out . <p> " You say you 're out of money , and they say they 'll take a pledge , " explained one lobbyist , asking anonymity because getting along with politicians is his livelihood . " If you 've maxed out on them , " meaning given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their friends . Or they want you to do an event , a fund-raiser , for them . " <p> " Recently we 've been getting 20 calls a day and maybe 30 invitations ( to fund-raisers ) a day , " reported William Hermelin , government affairs director of the American Pharmaceutical Association . " Of the 20 calls , four or five are from members . <p> " Two years ago , " he added , " we might have gotten four or five calls a day in the same time period . It was astounding if a member of Congress would call personally . " <p> Jack Valenti , the powerful , courtly longtime president of the Washington-based Motion Picture Association of America , is among those who 've had a snootful . " Their relentless , almost druglike , appetite for money , " he says of the current crop of politicians , " is like a flesh- eating bacteria attacking our national soul . " <p> These comments emerged from a recent Knight-Ridder survey of nearly 200 Washington lobbyists . Forty-five responded to questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases anonymous , offer new insight into arm-twisting by lawmakers from those who experience it most but , literally , can not afford to talk about it openly . <p> Much of the current fund-raising pressure follows from one simple fact : Ruling parties raise more money than minority parties , with the predictable result that those who can change the system do n't want to . <p> So money is talking loudly in the current Congress , while campaign finance reform , though high on the public 's agenda , is not just absent from the House Republicans ' Contract With America , but unlikely to come up , according to Gingrich , until next year . <p> Instead , the lawmaker who warned in 1990 that " Congress is increasingly enmeshed in a system of corruption in which money politics is defeating and driving out citizen politics " - Gingrich - is now using campaign money to consolidate his party 's hold on power . <p> Before the election , ranking Republicans were told by Gingrich and other GOP leaders that their futures depended on their persuading interest groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned as mentors to GOP challengers and asked to raise $ 60,000 for them . <p> Since the election , the National Republican Congressional Committee has widely circulated a list of the nation 's 400 biggest political action committees and their 1993-94 contributions . The list , meant to pressure givers to Democrats to convert to Republicans , tallies how much each PAC gave to each party . <p> Many new Republican leaders also have sharply hiked the price of tickets to their fund-raisers . A recent Gingrich event , for example , cost $ 2,000 compared with former Speaker Tom Foley 's $ 1,000 standard . Sen. Larry Pressler ( R-S.D. ) , chairman of the Commerce Committee , asks up to $ 2,500 . His predecessor , Sen. Ernest Hollings ( D-S.C. ) , charged $ 1,000 . <p> Freshman Republicans , many of them deeply in debt , are proving a particularly aggressive lot , lobbyists reported . <p> " They 've got more moxie than the old guard , " said one . " The old guard was a little apologetic . They thought fund raising was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'll say : ' I 'm having an event Thursday . It 's $ 1,000 . You should be buying two tickets . Who are you sending ? ' " <p> In a larger sense , that blunt , take-no-prisoners attitude toward fund raising is the ascendant one . <p> Under federal law , members of Congress can promise no " benefit provided for or made possible by any act of Congress as a reward for political activity or support . " Nor can they " solicit or receive political contributions in a federal building . " <p> Nonetheless , fund-raising tactics that appeared to be near or over those lines were widely reported by the lobbyists who were surveyed . Without exception , the politicians identified as heavy-handed denied the allegations . <p> Many lobbyists said that in the past year they had received fund- raising calls or letters from lawmakers while awaiting an appointment with them or shortly afterward . <p> " This happens with a frequency that causes me to believe it is not a coincidence , " observed Lloyd Hand , a senior partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McPherson and Hand . " It 's a seamy thing . " <p> None of these ploys are new , nor is twisting lobbyists ' arms strictly a Republican pastime . <p> According to lobbyists , three of the most aggressive contribution- seekers in recent Washington history were Democrats . One is still a senator . <p> Some of the increasing pressure on contributors is natural : Limits on contributions to federal candidates have been fixed since 1974 ( at $ 5,000 per election for political action committees and $ 1,000 for individuals ) while the average cost of winning office has risen more than six-fold . <p> These days , the average senator must raise nearly $ 13,000 a week , all through a six-year term , to mount a serious campaign . Senators from big states like New York and California must raise that much daily . <p> Short of trading support for money , lawmakers can press for contributions in many brash but legal ways . <p> Once direct contribution limits are reached , the easiest way to get more money out of lobbyists is to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . Members have one obligation : to pledge and raise a sum - usually $ 10,000 to $ 30,000 - from colleagues , clients , friends and vendors . Few can afford to decline . <p> Rare is the politician whose appetite for money is sated . <p> Rep. James Quillen ( R-Tenn. ) , for example , is 76 , has faced no real competition in his last three elections , and already has $ 1.3 million in his campaign treasury . Yet Quillen is calling " friends " at home to raise more money 18 months before he faces re-election . <p> " I wish I had more , " Quillen explained in an interview . " I ca n't think of any politician who would n't like to have a good nest egg . " <p> Many lobbyists respond to greedy lawmakers with repressed disgust . <p> One lobbyist put it simply : " Politicians who need money kiss up to a lot of people they 'd otherwise throw out of their offices .
