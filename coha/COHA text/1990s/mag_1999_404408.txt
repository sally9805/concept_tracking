From the Lake District to the North Sea , a weeklong walk reveals the soul-both gentle and wild-of Britain 's countryside . Photograph Above : Below : // I 'VE BEEN TOLD YOU HAVE TO DRUM A PLACE INTO your head with your feet , that no judgment of a countryside or city is worth a straw that is n't made by eyes and mind conditioned by the sights and experiences gained by hours of putting one foot in front of the other . So on a sunshiny morning last year , I joined the Wayfarers , a Rhode Island company specializing in walking tours , for a weeklong , 85-mile walk across northern England . The trip began in the Lake District , moved through the Yorkshire Dales in gentle Herriot country , continued across the wild Yorkshire moors , and ended at Captain Cook 's stirring seafaring town of Whitby , on the North Sea . A land of wild , treeless mountains , the Lake District is a small place that feels vast . A meandering network of stone walls , cyclopean tarns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves except the black mouths of ruminating sheep . My group of nine walkers set off from the tiny village of Lowick Green . Trip leader Tony Witt , a retired Scottish banker who has led walks for six years , blazed the way . " Substantial ups and downs , " Tony 's description of our first day 's walk , proved correct as we left the road and wheezed up tussocky fields and moors of dead bracken and green ferns . Following ancient paths , or rights-ofway , that cross the English countryside , we stepped over wooden ladders called stiles and through " kissing " gates before Tony stopped our hard-breathing group for a short respite at Beacon Tarn , one of the district 's many glacial lakes . After a pub lunch , we strolled alongside the lake and town of Coniston , then shudderwabbled into the welcoming Skelwith Bridge Hotel around six o'clock for hot baths and dinner . We had covered 16 miles . By nine o'clock the next morning , we were headed up Mill Brow and past Ivy Crag in what the locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain had stopped and it was as if the sun were being held in a giant fist with a little light escaping through the knuckles . We walked into charming but crowded Ambleside , perhaps using the same route Romantic poet William Wordsworth used to walk from Dove Cottage , his home in Grasmere , I6 miles northwest of the town . Much of Wordsworth 's best poetry was composed while walking , including the appropriate " to stray about/Voluptuously through fields and rural walks , /And ask no record of the hours . " Photograph The picturesque town of Whitby marked the end of the weeklong walk . Photograph The 18th-century Blue Lion Inn , in East Witton , was a welcome sight after day four 's 16-mile country ramble . // After coffee and a short look around Ambleside , we hiked along a path high above Lake Windermere , England 's largest lake ( lot/z miles long , narrow as a river ) . Leaving the water behind us , we headed east and down into the beautiful village of Troutbeck . Following lunch at the Mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep ascent on the Far Orrest footpath . We traipsed across meadows and past farms before descending into the Gilpin Valley and the Wild Boar Hotel . By day 's end we had traveled 14 miles . Over Hill and Dale in Herriot Country On our third day , we left the Lake District and drove an hour east into the Yorkshire Dales , where the Wayfarer van left us on a country road between the huge rounded humps of the dales ' hills . We hiked up steep Tarn Hill through reeds and sedge grass , then up top , tramped steadily east on a path that moved through tiny villages that had tried to make an impression on the vast landscape but appeared lost and exposed . Since the 1980s , , these dales had become familiar to millions around the world as the setting of James Herriot 's widely popular books and the BBC TV series " All Creatures Great and Small , " about animals and the life and loves of a country vet . Carrying dog-eared copies of James Herriot 's Yorkshire , thousands of visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking out pubs , inns , churches , and natural landmarks mentioned in Herriot 's works . After this day 's 13 miles , we stopped for the night in Askrigg , which served as Herriot 's fictional village of Darrowby in the BBC series . Askrigg 's Cringley House became Herriot 's Skeldale House and our hotel , the I7th-century Kings Arms Inn , stood in as Herriot 's Drovers Arms . On day four , we followed a path to where the purling Ure River suddenly drops zoo feet in a half mile into Aysgarth Falls , a series of three terraced waterfalls roaring over great slabs and shelves of rock . Two understated English superlatives were then on our agenda : Aysgarth 's I2th-century church , with the largest churchyard ( four acres ) in England , and lunch in West Burton , often cited as one of the country 's prettiest villages . Later , we attempted the steepest , toughest climb of the trip , a 1,100-foot ascent done in 50 minutes to the 1,600-foot summit . A kindly descent led us into the village of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from London . In late afternoon we passed the imposing 17th-century Braithwaite Hall , a rare Elizabethan house in Yorkshire , before walking into East Witton at dusk , yet another picture-perfect English village , and our hotel , the 18th-century Blue Lion Inn . Another i6-mile day . The Last Leg After an hour 's van drive east through dense earlymorning fog , our fifth day began at the North York Moors National Park-heather-clad , unenclosed , remote , uninhabited-great walking country , the last leg of our journey heading toward the North Sea . Beginning near Osmotherley as the sun burned off the fog , we marched across miles of saturated earth and peat , a kind of spongy version of the sea , soggy rather than boggy . At times the earth sighed and shuddered and felt alive . The moors changed moods with a puff of wind or passing cloud , from a wildly delightful wilderness to something dark and foreboding-I thought of Charlotte Bronte , who died pregnant in her 30s supposedly of a chill caught moor walking . We passed no villages until the sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stopped for lunch at the Hawnby Hotel , a I9th-century drovers ' inn . We had arrived by the same route taken by John Wesley , the founder of Methodism , Hawnby-bound to preach in 1757 . That afternoon we viewed the soaring arches of Rievaulx Abbey , founded in 1131 . In the late-afternoon sun , walking through its ruins , Shakespeare 's " bare ruined choirs where late the sweet bird sang " inevitably came to mind . We spent the night a few miles farther along at the Black Swan Hotel in the handsome market town of Helmsley . Our final day began with a drive to Pickering , where we boarded the restored North Yorkshire Moors Railway , a steam-powered recreational railroad that takes passengers on the I8-mile journey to the town of Grosmont . Leaving the train , we crossed the Esk River and began walking toward Sleights . By midafternoon , I could detect the sharp smell of the sea as we entered Whitby 's suburbs , then the red-roofed town itself , split by the Esk River . Tony led us along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at last , down to an inlet of the North Sea . At water 's edge we participated in the Wayfarers ' ceremonial toe-dip in the sea , marking the end of our excursion . A company representative then offered each of us a glass of Champagne .
