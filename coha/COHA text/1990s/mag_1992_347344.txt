WHEN ROSS PEROT INTRODUCED HIS VICE-PRESIdential candidate last week , he called him a " hero 's hero " and " a man of steel . " James Stockdale , 68 , a highly decorated former Navy fighter pilot and POW , fits those descriptions . But it remains to be seen whether the retired vice admiral is too prickly and independent to weather the give-and-take of a presidential campaign any more gracefully than Perot . <P> A native of Abingdon , Illinois , and a 1946 graduate of Annapolis , Stockdale was one of the most celebrated POWs of the Vietnam War . Captured in 1965 when he parachuted from his crippled A-4 jet , he spent nearly eight years at the camp known as the Hanoi Hilton . He endured regular torture sessions , and was often kept in leg irons and solitary confinement . At one point he severely bruised and cut himself so his captors would not dare parade him in front of their propaganda cameras . Stockdale , who still limps from his wartime injuries , was awarded the Medal of Honor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up the POW/MIA cause , thus paving the way for his close friendship with her husband . <P> A conservative intellectual who quoted the Stoic philosopher Epictetus to the press last week ( " A life not put to the test is not worth living " ) , Stockdale has spent most of his post-Vietnam career in a succession of academic and think-tank jobs . He has taught at the Naval War College and Stanford University , and was president at the Citadel . Since 1981 he has been a fellow of the Hoover Institution , an independent conservative research center that is located on the Stanford campus . Stockdale also served on the board of the ultra-right-wing Rockford Institute in Rockford , Illinois , from 1989 to 1991 and contributed to its monthly periodical , Chronicles , at a time when the organization came under fire from other conservatives for being " insensitive " to anti-Semitism . Stockdale 's articles , however , dwelled on his own Vietnam experience . <P> Stockdale 's only previous involvement in presidential politics was running Ronald Reagan 's California campaign in 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post in the Administration overseeing White House fellowships . In the current race , he is likely to play the " outside " man , stumping in the hinterlands while Perot concentrates on television appearances . But Stockdale , who is intensely private and introspective , may not prove adept at the traditional hand-pumping and baby-kissing role . <P> Throughout his career , he has exhibited a stubborn unwillingness to compromise his principles . He quit after his first year at the Citadel because of disagreements with the school 's board over reforms he sought , including an end to freshman hazing . Stockdale went on to teach ethics at Stanford , but the university eliminated his course after only one year . Stockdale claimed that he was dropped because of his affiliation with the controversial Hoover Institution , a charge Stanford officials denied . No one , however , takes issue with Stockdale 's frank self-description : " I am not an organization man . "
