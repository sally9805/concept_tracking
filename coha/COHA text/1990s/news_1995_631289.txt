<p> ' I have this terminal condition called bitchiness , right ? " Linda Fiorentino smiled , and tossed her hair back from her forehead . Straight , black hair , framing dark eyes that level with you . Just the way she looked in " The Last Seduction , " and just the way she looks in " Jade . " <p> At a time when half the women on the screen seem to be bimbos or slashers , she came along in 1994 with a low-budget film that brushed them aside . A film in which she played a woman who was smart , evil and ruthless , and who got away with it . In the video stores " The Last Seduction " is always out of stock ; it 's a cult hit not only among film fans , but among women who relate to her strong heroine , and among men who . . . <p> " There 's a challenge there that some men relate to , " Fiorentino was telling me . " I could feel it from the reactions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that characters and thought , I want to be the one to bring her to her knees . I could take her down . That 's the challenge for them ; the turn-on . " <p> In " The Last Seduction , " she knows what she wants and gets it . There 's a would-be stud in a bar who thinks he 's going to act macho and pick her up , and she wraps him around her little finger , in more ways than one . In " Jade " ( opening Friday at local theaters ) , she plays a related role , as a woman who is wife , mistress , threat , solution ; strong cops , lawyers and millionaires are mesmerized by her . <p> " I 'm single , " Fiorentino said , " and I 've gone on a few dates since ' The Last Seduction ' came out and I could see the disappointment in the eyes of men who thought I was going to be hot date and teach them all this weird stuff . And then they find out I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have leanings toward strange sexual behavior and it 's like a disappointment crosses their faces . " <p> In person , she 's likable and warm . She sets people at ease . That is not the character she plays in any of her best roles , including Martin Scorsese 's " After Hours " ( 1985 ) , where she was the leather-clad domanatrix , or in " Vision Quest " ( 1985 ) , where she was the 20-year-old who gets involved with the complicated kid on the high school wrestling team , and turns out to be even more complicated . The string continues in " Jade , " which was written by a certain Joe Eszterhas , whose credits include " Showgirls " and " Basic Instinct , " and directed by the master of thrillers , William ( " The Exorcist " ) Friedkin . <p> Basically , she plays bad girls , women with a secret , women who see through men . I asked her how that got started . <p> " I keep asking myself the same question , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't necessarily see in myself . And a lot of it in Hollywood has to do with what you look like . I 'm dark and my eyes are dark and my voice is deep , and how the hell could I play a Meg Ryan role , the way I look ? " <p> She looks great this morning , sitting in a Ritz-Carlton Hotel room , and then later over lunch downstairs in Foodlife . She is smart and verbal , and knows it , and likes to play with it . Her movie roles depend on that verbal power , which is ever so much more intriguing than ice picks and the other standard tools of the Hollywood Bitch . <p> Actors often say , I mused , that the evil roles are more fun to play . <p> " They are , but I think I 've done it enough now . I think there is a certain catharsis in being as evil as you can and getting away with it , and getting paid for it . " That sounded splendidly villainous , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way she was kidding herself . <p> There 's a theory , I said , that Hollywood executives are afraid of women , and that explains why women are seen in the movies as either helpless sex symbols or perpetuators . If they 're not a victim , they have a knife in their hand . Very few of them are friends , lovers , mates in the movies . <p> " These men obviously have problems . " <p> What 's going on with that ? <p> " I think it must correlate with power , you know . When we were doing ' Jade , ' the way Joe Eszterhas wrote the sex scenes was so dated and so boring , and I just thought , I ca n't do this . And there was a lot of nudity , and I thought , we 've got ta come up with something a little more interesting , just to keep me going here . <p> " So I did a little random research , you know , and I asked a couple of women I had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invariably those men in powerful positions wanted to be dominated by the woman at the end of the day . They wanted to be the submissive party in the sex act , and it correlated with the level of power . Maybe men with no power want to dominate their women . I just thought , well , this is interesting . And it 's the same for women : Women want to be the dominant party because that 's their fantasy and the male fantasy is to be the submissive party . And so we got into that in ' Jade . ' " <p> It is a little strange , I said , for you to come off of " The Last Seduction , " which took no hostages , and now you find yourself in a screenplay by Joe Eszterhas , whose insights into women are , to say the least , on a different level . When I talked to Friedkin at the Venice Film Festival , he said you were the most courageous woman he had ever known . Now what did he mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest filmmaking experience . It was a courageous attempt on my part , and I think Billy recognized that . " <p> What took courage ? <p> " At the time . . . I 'm gon na tell you things I have n't told anybody yet . . . at the time I was reacting to a lot of things that were going on in my life in terms of , well , suddenly being recognized for a change . " <p> Tears started in her eyes as she said that , but she cleared her throat and carried on . <p> " I think that had a lot to do with my approach to the role . There was a lot of resentment and I think that became a part of the filmmaking process on ' Jade . ' I mean , I truly was living moment to moment and I think Billy recognized that . He knew how difficult it was for me at that point . I was very skeptical about doing this film . I 'm not a huge Joe Eszterhas fan , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole other world . I was very skeptical about getting involved in this production and I think that Billy , having had the experience that he had up until that point , became sort of a mentor to me , and said , ' You know what ? I screwed up , Linda , and as your fan I 'm not going to let you screw up . ' And I think that became part of the collaborative effort on the film itself and so in that way became more exciting for me . " <p> You mean , he felt that he had screwed up earlier in his career with certain choices ? <p> " Absolutely . At a very young age he was the biggest director in Hollywood for a while ( after ' The French Connection ' and ' The Exorcist ' ) , and I think he believed there came a time when he betrayed himself and his work . So I learned a lot from him . " <p> Fiorentino speaks with such a low voice it 's a surprise to discover she 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to confidences and asides and , in the movies , to seductive conspiracies that men are later going to regret they ever heard . She has presence and style that have always been there , in both good movies and bad . In the right role they make her intriguing , like the great bad ladies of the screen , like Barbara Stanwyck in " Double Indemnity , " or Faye Dunaway in " Network , " or the Marlene Dietrich who said , " You do n't get to be known as Shanghai Lil in one night . " <p> I asked her : Have you always been , more or less , like you are ? Is this you ? <p> " I do n't think so , " she said . " I think that we all reinvent ourselves . We all grow up with different experiences . I grew up in a large Italian Catholic family ; very operatic . It makes sense that I would choose acting as a career . I had a difficult time as a child trying to find my own place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and I think that we were all trying to find our way  --  and I literally reinvented myself for the attention . I became like this . " <p> Who were you before you reinvented yourself ? <p> " A nerdy little kid who always got straight A 's , which were never good enough for my parents : ' Yeah , you got straight A 's . Let 's see if you can do it again . ' And I was always in the advanced math class and I think by the time I got to high school , I realized that that was n't very attractive to the boys , that I was smarter than them . So I began to pretend I was a little more stupid , I think . " <p> I think you 've gone back to the " smarter than them " image . . . <p> She smiled again . <p> " Maybe a combination . What works on the surface may not work beneath the surface . " <p> Say what ? <p> " Is n't that the agreement that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make when you pay that $ 8 . You 're going to go in there and believe everything that you see , whether it 's true or not . It 's the surface that counts . It 's a complicity between the filmmaker and the audience and that 's what makes it work . After ' The Last Seduction ' came out , I 'd have a dental hygenist telling me , while I 'm having my teeth cleaned , ' I saw your movie and I went home and behaved like a bitch and my boyfriend loved it . We had the hottest sex that we had in a long time . ' I just thought , this is astounding . " <p> " That definitely was a dream role . After I read that script , I was in Arizona and I got in a car and drove six hours to get to the meeting because I had never read anything so unique in terms of a female character . And I walked in the meeting with John Dahl , the director , and I said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for this film . ' And I was n't kidding . I figured it was a kind of role and a kind of film that if it worked it would work very well and if it did n't , I would probably be in law school right now pursuing my other career . " <p> Yeah , I said , you were headed for law school when you got sidetracked into acting . Well , you could always play Marcia Clark . You look a little like her . " <p> " My eyes are dark enough .
