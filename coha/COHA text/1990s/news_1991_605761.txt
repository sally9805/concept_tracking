<p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> I recently witnessed the ticketing of two cars by a D.C. Department of Public Works ticket writer in a way that made my blood boil . <p> At approximately 5:45 p.m. on Nov. 13 , at 1720 K Street NW , DPW officer with badge 242 began writing a ticket for a car parked in violation of a No Standing-No Stopping-No Parking during rush hour sign . <p> The driver was in the car reading a book , apparently waiting to pick someone up leaving work in the adjacent building . The ticket writer stood precisely in the driver 's blind spot , about five feet from the right rear corner of the car ; the driver was oblivious of her . <p> After the officer had begun the ticket , being sure to get the license number of the offender onto her pad , she then walked up to the passenger window of the car , which was closed , and waved her ticket book . The driver , not knowing that the ticket already had been partly written , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . <p> At this point , the officer flipped the page of the ticket book and began writing a ticket for the next car in line , also parked in violation of the same sign . <p> Before she had finished the second ticket , the driver of the second car approached his vehicle , entered it , and drove away . She did nothing to inform or advise the poor fellow that he was to receive the pink slip from hell . In fact , she flipped back to the first ticket and completed that one , then flipped again to the second to finish the double-header . <p> At this point , I asked badge number 242 what was going to happen to the tickets . She replied that each driver will get a default judgment for $ 100 because the tickets will be mailed to them AFTER THE 15-DAY APPEAL PERIOD , thus doubling the $ 50 fine . <p> I pointed out to her that she had an opportunity in each case to either put the ticket on the car or actually hand it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was none of my damn business and that I should get out of her face . She also offered to have me thrown in jail . <p> This is a terrible scam on the public . There are two drivers out there who , though they did park illegally , have no idea that tickets were written , will not have an opportunity to exercise a right of appeal , or even give their side at a hearing , and will be forced to pay double the fine . <p> There is apparently nothing to prevent an unsavory ticket writer from writing up anyone , for any reason , and instead of placing the ticket on the car , the revenue will double if the ticket stays in the book . How many other poor souls have been the victim of this rip-off ? <p> P.S. A message to badge number 242 : Yes , it is my business to question your practices . DAVID M. LAUTENBERGER Washington <p> Dr. Gridlock read this complaint to the spokesman for the Department of Public Works , Richard He'bert . He declined to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview . <p> " This was a new recruit who had just finished her training . She had n't been on the street a week , and perhaps she was a little slow writing the tickets , " He'bert said . " Apparently some kind of altercation with your correspondent did take place . We do n't condone this kind of discourtesy , or rudeness ; we want our parking control aides to be ambassadors for the city . But you need to understand that aides sometimes get subjected to abuse ; all the abuse is not on one side . We 've had aides assaulted . No one likes to get tickets . " <p> Although she may have wanted to put you in jail , Mr. Lautenberger , parking control aides do n't have the power . Police do , but they write only about 25 percent of the parking tickets ; aides write the rest . <p> Now here 's what happens when the motorist drives off before the ticket can be issued : There is no violation . <p> Says He'bert : " The corporation counsel ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket has to be put on the windshield or given to the violator . " <p> If the motorist drives off before the ticket is written , the aide is supposed to note that on the pink ( motorist 's ) copy of the ticket . If the aide fails to note that , the aide will have to explain why two copies of the ticket are turned in , He'bert said . <p> If any tickets somehow slip through and make it to court , they are automatically voided unless the aide has failed to note that the motorist drove off before the ticket was issued . In that case , you have to convince the adjudicator you never got the ticket and therefore the fine should n't be doubled . You are then in the same boat with the poor souls who have their tickets removed from their cars by someone else . <p> Soon , the city will change its training program for parking control aides to place greater emphasis on people-to-people skills . " The focus will be on the need to be civil and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were right to question this procedure , Mr. Lautenberger , and it was a learning experience . But the folks you guessed would be victims in this instance probably were not cited . I would say that makes the real victims here the inconvenienced motorists who lost a lane of rush-hour traffic because of these selfish individuals . <p> Someone is reading a book , waiting for someone to get off work and sitting in a lane of rush-hour traffic ? Come on . You run into that kind of driver all the time : Their time is more important than yours . We want the city to be aggressive on this . These two bozos should have been ticketed , and apparently they were n't . That 's what does n't seem fair here . Preventing Backups on the Beltway <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> As someone who makes a daily morning trek up Landover Road in Prince George 's County and around the Beltway to Bethesda , I had to write and ask what is being done to help alleviate the constant stop and stop traffic on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beltway , from I-95 around to the Georgia Avenue exits , is a clogged mess . <p> The new collector/distributor lanes on I-270 seem to work well . Any plans in the works to add such lanes to the exits for New Hampshire Avenue , University Boulevard , Colesville Road and Georgia Avenue ? <p> Having CD lanes on the Outer Loop in those areas would help reduce the early morning jams and the benefits must outweigh the costs : the savings in wasted fuel dollars alone would be tremendous . <p> If not CD lanes , has there been any consideration of opening up shoulder lanes in these areas for rush hours ? Again , the benefits would be tremendous and the costs would n't seem that high . What can you tell us ? BARRY C. DOWELL Lothian <p> There 's some good news , short-term , but as for so many of our transportation problems , no comprehensive solution in view . <p> Next spring , the Maryland State Highway Administration will break ground to add one lane in each direction on the Capital Beltway between Route 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years to complete and will provide some relief . <p> There are some improvements planned for the Georgia Avenue interchange , but no funding . No other Beltway work is planned between New Hampshire and Georgia avenues . <p> As for the cost of paving a shoulder , it would seem like " savings in wasted fuel dollars " could help finance that , but there is no way I 've heard of to translate such savings into dollars for the state highway construction budget . Though paving the shoulder would seem relatively inexpensive , on this stretch several Beltway bridges would have to be widened to provide clearance requirements for a lane of traffic , according to highway administrator Hal Kassoff . <p> " Besides , the shoulder is our ace in the hole to convert eventually to an HOV lane , " Kassoff said . The regional thinking is to add an HOV lane around the entire Beltway , " but that 's looking like long-term , in the five- to 10-year time frame , " Kassoff said . <p> Now that the federal government has released millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out what its matching requirements are , and then what projects will get the money . From talking with Kassoff , it sounds like the next Beltway project that might have the best chance for funding would be the long-sought ( by residents in Montgomery and Frederick counties particularly ) widening of the Y split , where Interstate 270 comes into the Beltway . The Y is where six lanes merge into four . <p> The Georgia Avenue interchange work is important , " but would have to compete for money with tons of other projects all over Maryland , " Kassoff said . Does n't sound so good . <p> Meanwhile , your daily commute , Mr. Dowell , every day from Lothian in southern Anne Arundel County , through Prince George 's County and around the Beltway in bumper-to-bumper traffic to Bethesda makes me wince with pain . Is there any way to change jobs or move ? Is this what life has come to for so many of us ? Is it worth it ? <p> In Va. , Some Road Sign Innovations <p> Dear Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Innovative Technology have come up with a unique way of naming roads . <p> Heading northbound on Route 28 near Dulles Airport , you see a sign that reads : INNOVATION DR . An arrow indicates it is the next right . <p> Coming southbound on Route 28 you see a sign that reads INNOVATION RD. , with its arrow indicating a left turn . <p> When you actually get to the intersection , lo and behold , the street becomes INNOVATION AVE. ! <p> Do n't the folks at the sign department talk to each other before putting up signs ? GEORGE SANTULLI Leesburg <p> Innovative , were n't they ? This is what can happen when you get multiple agencies involved in any task . Here 's the accounting of the Virginia Department of Transportation , from spokeswoman Mary Anne Reynolds : <p> " VDOT maintains more than 140,000 signs in Northern Virginia , and , alas , an error like this sometimes slips through . In this case , the blue-and-white street sign installed by Fairfax County at the intersection ( Innovation Avenue ) is correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 improvement project installed the wrong signs . <p> VDOT thanks the reader for calling this to our attention . We 'll fix it in the next week or two so all the innovations agree . " Two Look Into Wilson Bridge Hot Line <p> A postscript to the reader 's plea for a hot line to call for Woodrow Wilson Bridge openings : Rep. Constance A. Morella ( R-Md. ) and the American Automobile Association 's Rob Krebs are trying to figure out how to set one up . The key information rests with the District government , which controls the drawbridge and is first informed of approaching ships . <p> Morella and Krebs have good track records . Morella , in response to reader complaints that having two George Washington Memorial Parkways was confusing , got the segment on the Maryland side renamed the Clara Barton Parkway . Krebs has set up several hot lines for the AAA . Good luck , folks . We can certainly use this . <p> Dr. Gridlock appears in this section each Thursday to explore local transportation matters . He 'll try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about them . You can suggest topics by writing ( please do n't phone ) to DR . GRIDLOCK , The Washington Post , 1150 15th St. NW , Washington , D.C. 20071.
