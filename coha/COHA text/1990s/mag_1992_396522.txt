The last time Gay Talese was in the public eye , he was buck naked . It was 1980  --  the twilight of the sexual revolution  --  and in the final scene of his incendiary study of America 's most bizarre sexual appetites , Thy Neighbor 's Wife , Talese stood in a nudist colony , unencumbered by fashion , contemplating the body parts of total strangers . The bestselling , critically lambasted book , along with Talese 's candor about his infidelities , caused such a scandal that it strained his marriage , embarrassed his children and left an unsavory odor on his solid reputation as a master of literary nonfiction . In order to lower all those raised eyebrows , Talese has spent the past decade immersed in a weighty act of contrition . The result is Unto the Sons , a book that places him back squarely in the bosom of his family . Unto the Sons is a 635-page historical saga of the Talese clan 's migration from the toe of the Italian boot to the heart of American letters . Furthermore , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former altar boy who has become a stylish exhibitionist and an unapologetic sybarite . It is an affectionate ode to a past that he fled . The son of isolated Italian Catholics living in rigidly Methodist Ocean City , N.J. , Talese was doubly ostracized as a boy , since even the Catholic minority in town was Irish . He grew up wearing perfect suits sewn by his tailor father  --  feeling like a tiny mannequin . " This is the first time that the public will see the man I married , " says his wife , Nan . " The sensitive soul who hides behind the stiff formality . " " You will not catch me without a necktie , " says the 60-year-old author , who has peculiar and unvarying work habits . He writes first in longhand on yellow pads , then copies at his electric typewriter while wearing one of his 64 $2,000 custom-made three-piece suits with a silk paisley handkerchief draped from the breast pocket . His manner is so aloof that even friends mistake it for arrogance . " He comes from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Pileggi . " His manner and style is of the 19th century . " It has been 12 years since Talese 's last book , but his track record is such that his publisher , Alfred A. Knopf , has ordered a first printing of 200,000 copies . Sons is a main selection of the Book of the Month Club  --  and the first book of three that will fulfill Talese 's $7 million contract . The reviews so far have been respectful , if not exactly enthusiastic . Most reviewers agree that the book , though sometimes mired in detail , provides a compelling glimpse of immigrant experience . " As usual with Mr. Talese 's books , the narrative weaves back and forth in time and space , looping flashbacks within flashbacks and spinning reveries within reveries , " wrote an admiring Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in The New York Times It was at the Times that Talese began his career . He calls his 1959-65 stint as a feature writer there " the only truly happy time of my life . The city room , with its sympathetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wept when he left , but he soon became famous for his contributions to the New Journalism , reporting with all the drama and color  --  and some of the license  --  of fiction . His lush magazine portraits of Frank Sinatra , Joe DiMaggio and heavyweight champ Joe Louis influenced a generation of writers , including Tom Wolfe . Talese became rich writing seamless books on the history of the Times ( The Kingdom and the Power , 1969 ) and of a Mafia family ( Honor Thy Father , 1971 ) , followed by the steamy Thy Neighbor 's Wife . After the reaction to Wife , with all the attendant gossip about his admitted affairs , he was crushed . " I knew that the book was good . I did n't expect this backlash , " he says . In 1981 , in order to plunge into something solid , he decided to write a biography of Chrysler chairman and fellow Italian-American Lee Iacocca . But after spending a year with his subject , he grew disillusioned . " There was the matter of the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on meetings in which Iacocca denounced the air bags as a waste of money . Later he took credit for pushing them . After that I could n't do the book . " ( Iacocca was unavailable for comment . ) And so , in March 1982 , he gave it up . " Besides , I really wanted to write about the family I had avoided , " says Talese . He started by returning to Ocean City , an island community founded by abstinent Methodists 20 miles south of Atlantic City , where his father , Joseph , settled in 1922 . Talese retraced the family odyssey from the town of Maida in Southern Italy . He talked for hours with such relatives as his cousin Antonio Cristiani , a Paris-based designer who once employed Emanuel Ungaro . Cristiani , who died in 1989 before the book was completed , provided stories about the Talese uncles and cousins who fought in both world wars . ( To Talese 's father 's anguish , they fought against the Allies in World War II . ) Gradually the threads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowards , running away from poverty , " Talese says of the immigrants . " They were brave to take such chances  --  gamblers but I do n't think I would have left . " The insular nature of Southern Italian towns , far from cosmopolitan Rome and steeped in superstition , explained for Talese his family 's provincial attitudes . " Never educate your children beyond yourself " was a saying in Maida . " Trust no one but family " was a rule to live by . " This is why Southern Italians , like Mario Cuomo ( Governor of New York ) , only trust relatives , " he says . In his own youth Talese was branded " dago , " and " wop , " and it was a relief in 1949 when he left Ocean City and went to the University of Alabama , which he liked because it was far away . " I was never a good student , " he says . " Too busy daydreaming or watching . From my earliest days I wanted to become a journalist to escape that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he served as a public relations officer , he landed a job at The New York Times . He has escaped and he has succeeded , and he remains drawn to stories of triumph pulled from defeat . Now , having fallen from literary grace with Thy Neighbor 's Wife , he hopes that Sons will be both a critical comeback and a popular winner . The likelihood of the latter worries him . " There 's very little sex in this book ... , " he says fretfully . Not that there were n't a few dalliances during the research phase . ( There was one with a translator , another with a diplomat . ) " All friends , all people I trust , " he says ardently , dismissing charges that he is recklessly promiscuous . His behavior now , he says , is more cautious than in the riotous days when he attended Sandstone , the experimental nudist colony in California . There , he admits , " I did everything you can imagine with everyone . " " But he called me every night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark , slender woman from New York 's affluent Westchester County by way of white-glove Manhattanville College . They were introduced by friends in 1957 and married in Rome two years later . " There have been some very hard times , " concedes Gay . " Especially after the last book . " A talented editor who has her own eponymous publishing imprint at Doubleday , Nan believes that Gay 's talent outranks all other considerations in their lives . She says that " he has to get close to his subject " and understands the implications . They are both convinced that their marriage will endure in spite of its testing of conventions . " I love my wife , " says Talese . " It is a very physical relationship . Very physical . And often . This very day ! " Nevertheless there are moments when Nan 's Irish Catholic reticence will surface . " Gay is a little too public with our lives , " she says . Quick though he is to part with privacy , Talese is nervous about how his public perceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading from Unto the Sons , he paces the stage , calculating the distance between himself and his audience  --  in feet as well as in cultural style . And as he begins to read of the lonely childhood years he spent gazing at Atlantic City in the distance , his voice takes on a tremulous quality : I was olive-skinned in a freckle-faced town , and I felt unrelated even to my parents , especially my father , who was indeed a foreigner  --  an unusual man in dress and manner , to whom I bore no physical resemblance and with whom I could never identify . His aloof mother , Catherine , now 85 , seemed powerful and alien : Once , during my preschool days , I put my hand inside the pocket of her coat .... I felt her hand , gently but firmly , remove my own . So painful are some of the passages that the audience winces . But Gay speaks later of his childhood with detachment and forgiveness  --  though he has not yet let his 88-year-old father , Joseph , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll like it .... There are things in it which he may find painful .... He wo n't understand .... He 'll hate it , " Talese says . This internal revisionism is a perfectionist 's quirk , a gyroscopic correction he makes after every utterance . No sooner has he ventured an opinion than he issues a counterargument . This is why his books appear so infrequently . Having triumphed over an astringent childhood , Talese now lives like a duke in a four-story New York City brownstone off Park Avenue . The rooms are fragrant with flowers and bracketed by bookcases . There is a deck where he once played paddle tennis with his daughters , Pamela , 27 , an art student who lives on the second floor , and Catherine , 24 , a landscape photographer now living in San Francisco . There is a conscious , almost perverse duality to Gay 's daily routine , which is carried out with clockwork precision . In the mornings he is the disciplined soldier . He awakens at 7 and retreats to his monk 's cell in the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his color-coded files . There he takes his breakfast , which never varies  --  bran cereal , coffee and fruit . And he furtively smokes cigarettes as he writes , rewrites and arranges his typewritten pages on a wall and studies them through binoculars . ( He is already at work on a sequel to Sons . ) " There is something important about how it looks , " he says . In the afternoon he plays a hard-hitting but joyless set of tennis at the chic midtown Vertical Club . ( " He has to win , " says Nan . ) In the evenings he and Nan frequently eat at the Upper East Side literary salon , Elaine 's , where he drinks exactly 1-1/2 vodka martinis . Then they float between the endless parties , openings and screenings available to a couple who belong to the celebrity set . The old childhood memories linger , but a soft reconciliation has occurred over the years . His only sibling , Marian , 56 , who runs an art gallery in Ocean City , says that she always knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the night . His father was not always certain . " When he told me he wanted to go to college , I went to the newspaper editor , " says Joseph . " I ask him , " Should I let him go ? " He tells me , " If Gay was my son , I 'd sell my house to send him to college . ' " Joseph smiles almost sadly . " But he would have made a great tailor , " he says . <p>
