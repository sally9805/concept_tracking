Section : On the Scene <p> Dateline : PARIS <p> WHEN ALGERIANS leave their country , their most common destination is Paris , which is where I heard what happened to the mayor of Ain-Fezza . ( Given the current climate in Algeria , his family would rather I not use his name . ) He was a pious man of about 40 whose family had given several martyrs ( as they are still called ) to the independence cause in the 1954 - 62 war against France . The family was rewarded with persecution by the victorious FLN ( National Liberation Front )  --  not an uncommon turn of events after the revolution . ' <p> The mayor was elected on the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) ticket in 1990 , as the Islamist party , in the country 's first multi-party elections , swept town halls across Algeria . Today FIS is joining names like Hamas ' and Hezbollah ' in representing the kind of militant , fundamentalist Islam that is bent on eradicating Western influence from the Muslim world . Divided by doctrinal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion that the problems of Islamic societies are best addressed by establishing theocratic republics based on the Koranic law . <p> German Chancellor Helmut Kohl considers radical Islamic regimes armed with ballistic missiles the number-one security threat to Europe , ahead of the potential for fascism ' or spreading anarchy in the East . Many Algerians agree with him . In a demonstration in Algiers on June 29 , leaders of the democratic parties called for a war to the end against Islamic fundamentalism . <p> In this they are going against the tendency of the Clinton Administration , which has indicated that it favors an opening to the nonviolent ' Islamists  --  to which category the mayor of Ain-Fezza decidedly belonged . To be sure , he entered politics because of what his family had suffered at the hands of the FLN . But he was also disturbed that in the villages that make up Ain-Fezza there was not a single paved road until 1989 . Electricity came in 1990 . The water system was a fountain built by the French during the colonial period . To get water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jerry cans . <p> The mayor could ask himself : For this my relatives died ? To build support , all the FIS had to do was ask people if they felt the FLN had treated them right . It is commonly alleged in Algeria that the personal accounts of the FLN elites in political and military circles are about equal to Algeria 's foreign debt . <p> So men like the mayor of Ain-Fezza were , in a very real sense , the voice of the downtrodden masses . The problem is that most frustrated young men in a country like Algeria do not go into politics to get a proper water system for their home town . Most frustrated young men want to make a clean sweep of things , proving their own worth in the process . The effective leaders of the FIS are not local reformers but fanatical preachers and gunmen trained in part with money from U.S. taxpayers . These are the Afghans , ' former allies of the mujahedin . <p> There have been some spectacular shootouts in Algeria 's hills and the slums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims it has cornered the leaders ' or finished off the MIA ' ( the FIS 's armed wing ) . Each time , the fighting resumes . At present , between three and four hundred people a week are being killed in a civil war that is approaching the Lebanese scale in its savagery . <p> When it outlawed the FIS in mid- 1992 , the army allowed Ain-Fezza to stay in the hands of the freely elected Islamists . But the Afghans are not men of water supplies . They ambushed soldiers on patrols , severed their heads , and left them at crossroads . After the last Ramadan , in February , they announced that women without the Islamic veil would be targeted . Secularists said they would retaliate against veiled women . Partly because of such violence , women were among the leaders of the June 29 demonstration , which was attacked with bombs . <p> In these conditions , the army hard-liners , despite the conciliatory gestures of the Algerian president , General Lamine Zeroual , are not inclined to seek Islamists with whom to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repression . ' <p> When you want to make an example , it is always easier to choose reasonable men as targets . The soldiers came for the young mayor of Ain-Fezza at three in the morning . They took him to the village square with four of his relatives and about a dozen others , and shot them all . <p> It may prove increasingly difficult to find nonviolent ' Islamists for the West to make contacts ' with . Several weeks ago Afghans murdered the president of the Algerian League for Human Rights , an austere , righteous lawyer named Fathallah , in his office in central Algiers . It was odd , on the face of it , because he had insisted on fair trials for terrorist ' suspects and had defended quite a few himself . But neither the Afghans nor the soldiers , at this point , believe there is anything anything that can be settled through the rule of law . <p> PHOTO : Algerian with a knife in his teeth <p> By ROGER KAPLAN <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
