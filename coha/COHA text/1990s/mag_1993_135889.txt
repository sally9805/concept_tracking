It was like hearing from an old flame who 'd dumped you the instant something better came along . Now she was calling to invite you to dinner ... to meet her fianc ? . // It had been 3 ? years since Norm Green bought the Minnesota North Stars , 3 ? years since he swept into the Twin Cities as the savior of professional hockey , criticizing the previous owners for threatening to uproot the team and take ii to another state . // It had been six months since Green uprooted the team and took it to another state . Now the Dallas Stars were in Minneapolis for a neutral-site game against the Ottawa Senators . Banners were forbidden at the Target Center last Thursday night , but plenty of jilted Minnesotans found ways to express themselves . The medium varied  --  from T-shirts to caps to a cathartic chant  --  but the message was the same , summed up by a slogan on a button : UPON FURTHER REVIEW ... NORM STILL SUCKS . // The game , in which Dallas dispatched the dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be played this season in the Target Center . The driving force behind getting those games is Dana Warg , the Target Center 's executive director , who is courting Edmonton Oiler owner Peter Pocklington , a man seeking a new home for his team . // A serendipitous scheduling conflict with the NHL 's Board of Governors meetings in Southern California gave the 59-year-old Green a good excuse to skip Thursday 's game , which he did . After all , a choice between soaking up verbal abuse and soaking up rays in Laguna Niguel is n't much of a choice . // But will Green soon be looking for excuses to avoid Dallas fans as well ? Texans have yet to join their Minnesota brethren in obscene chants directed at the Stars ' owner , but Green 's Dallas honeymoon was nonetheless fleeting . On Oct. 1 the Stars sued the city of Dallas for the right to advertise beer inside the arena at home games , a right now held exclusively by the NBA Mavericks . Then , 37 days after his team 's Dallas debut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team out of Big D. The club denied that Green had issued such a threat , but given his history in Minnesota , the quote seemed to have the ring of truth . // While Green was busy wearing out his welcome in Dallas in record time , Minnesota was waging a curiously halfhearted battle to regain an NHL franchise . Pocklington , who is desperate to get his team out of Alberta , has been speaking of the Twin Cities in glowing terms , which has made some Twin Citians nervous . One of the league 's most-cash-strapped owners , Pocklington has systematically unloaded the team 's best players . The Oilers have won just six of their 32 games this season ; only the Senators are worse . Most Minnesotans do n't see a Norm-for-Peter Puck swap as much of a bargain . // " It 's a moral dilemma , " said Mary LeTourneau , editor of the Minnesota North Stars Booster Club newsletter . " Of course we want NHL hockey back . But we 're afraid Pocklington will present us with a lousy team , fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team somewhere else . If that happens , we 'll never get another chance . People are n't sure how to feel about it . " // They do know how they feel about their departed team . In the 18,700-seat Target Center , the disappointing turnout on Thursday was announced as 14,058 , but it looked more like a crowd of about 12,000 . The impossible had happened . The team had gone , and some of its most loyal fans actually lived happily ever after . " I 'm speaking now as a private citizen , not as president of the North Stars Booster Club , " said Doug Rausch , lowering his voice to avoid being overheard by fellow boosters , " but I do n't miss the Stars as much as I thought I would . Plus , with the money we saved on season tickets , we bought a house . " Chimed in another former season-ticket holder , Tom Saari , " I paid off my cabin . " // The Star players , too , are surviving quite nicely , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf ) . They appreciate the absence of a state income tax . They even like flying into and out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport . They are only occasionally weirded out by the odd geographical twist their careers have taken . In filling out a lineup card before a preseason game against the Florida Panthers , Star head coach Bob Gainey found himself writing , " Dallas vs . Florida . " Says Gainey , who played 16 seasons for the Montreal Canadiens , " Once in a while , it hits you  --  this is different . " // But apparently it 's a welcome difference for Texans . The Stars have averaged 15,374 fans per game at 16,814-seat Reunion Arena . Some come for the hockey , some for the carnival atmosphere . Anyone who has ever attended a Star home game will not be surprised to learn that Jeff Cogen , the team 's vice-president of advertising and marketing , was once an employee of Ringling Brothers . It is the rare professional sporting event that offers such promotions as deejay dog races , in which local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sleds , and between-periods sumo wrestling . // In its first season as a hockey venue , Reunion Arena has become one of the NHL 's toughest rinks for visiting teams . The Stars are 15-10-7 but have lost just one of 17 at home . One key to their success  --  besides Cogen , of course  --  has been the play of 23-year-old Mike Modano , a No. 1 draft pick in 1988 , who is having a breakthrough season . When Modano pumped in the first of his two goals against Ottawa ( he now has 24 in 32 games ) , LeTourneau , of the North Stars Booster Club , shook her head . " I paid $2,000 a year to see this kind of performance from him , " she said . " As soon as they go somewhere else , he goes nuts . " // The shared ordeal of moving to a new city has resulted in a closeness they had not previously known , say most of the Stars . Says defenseman Mark Tinordi , " Moving means all these little hassles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shop . Doing it together has made us more of a family . " // And as in most families , there is a certain amount of bickering . " There 's such a thing as seeing too much of one another , " says Neal Broten , who skates on a forward line with his brother Paul . " The weather in Texas is the same all the time . Every day you throw on the same old shirt , same old pair of jeans . I do n't even need my winter boots . I miss the snow . I miss firing up my truck , cranking the heater , scraping off the windshield  --  all that stuff I grew up with . " // Broten 's mood might have begun to sour earlier this season when a stranger in Dallas provided him with an unsolicited hockey tutorial . Sidelined by a hip-flexor injury , Broten was in the stands for a game when a fan began explaining offsides . " The guy meant well , " says Broten , who recently played in his 900th NHL game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To teach Texans the game 's finer points , the club ran a weeklong series of ads in The Dallas Morning News this fall . The series was called Hockey 101 , and each day it explained a new term . " Icing  --  no , not the stuff on a birthday cake , " one lesson began . " Spearing  --  no , not what you do to get an olive , " said another . // There is plenty to learn . There is still the occasional panic in the stands when the goalie leaves the crease on a delayed penalty . Someone stop him ! He thinks the period is over ! " But for the most part , " says Star president James Lites , " our fans know when to cheer . After three or four games , they become experts . " // And the experts agree that the biggest need is simply to learn to live with Norm Green . On Nov. 12 Green was quoted in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram as having told the Dallas International Sports Commission that if the city would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new facility , he would consider moving his team to nearby Tarrant County . Although Green declined to be interviewed for this article , a team spokesman says his comments were " taken out of context . " // " So now he 's bitching about Dallas ? " said Steve Froehlig , who showed up at the Target Center for Thursday 's game with a haircut that read NORM STILL SUCKS . " There 's a surprise . " // For all the anti-Norm chants during the game against Ottawa , most of the people at the Target Center otherwise seemed content to applaud their old friends . In a nod to the Stars ' erstwhile home , Gainey put the two Brotens , Jim Johnson and Trent Klatt  --  all Minnesotans  --  on the ice to start the game . After his first goal Modano saluted section 101 , where the still-intact Booster Club was seated . // Later Modano was asked about his transition from Minnesota to Texas . Was it difficult ? Traumatic ? " Actually , " he said , " it was pretty easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf clubs . " // So much for sentimentality . Afterward , instead of driving to the suburbs where most of them used to live , the Stars walked to their hotel . The next morning they boarded a plane bound for the city that is their new home . // For now .
