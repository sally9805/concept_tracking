SCIENTISTS AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIversity in Baltimore knew something was wrong . Every morning when they checked the lab where their experimental animals were housed , they found one or two dead mice . At first they thought the rodents , whose genes had been manipulated to block production of a key neurotransmitter , might be having heart attacks . But when they looked more closely at the cages , they found bloodstains and tufts of fur , evidence suggesting an even more chilling possibility . <P> Was there a murderer among the mice ? Indeed there was . In a paper published in Nature last week , a team from Johns Hopkins and Massachusetts General Hospital reported that by " knocking out " a gene essential to the synthesis of nitric oxide , an important neurotransmitter in the brains of mice and men , they had inadvertently created a strain of extraordinarily ferocious male rodents ( females were unaffected ) . <P> Fast and fearless , these mice were six times as likely to pick a fight as normal , wild-type mice . And they scratched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from killing their rivals . Moreover , the males engaged in " excessive and inappropriate " sexual advances , mounting females despite " substantial vocal protestations . " " It was very dramatic , " says Dr. Solomon Snyder of Johns Hopkins . " The females would squeal , ' Rape ! Rape ! Rape ! ' but the males just would n't stop . " <P> Researchers speculate that nitric oxide may effect the emotion-regulating areas of the brain , perhaps by putting the brakes on aggressive male behavior . Could a lack of nitric oxide help explain violent impulses in humans ? Scientists caution against making facile comparisons . But they are watching the mad mice of Baltimore closely , looking for clues to treating similar behavior in humans . <P>  --  Reported by Alice Park/New York
