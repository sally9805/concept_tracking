Out of the darkness THE GHOSTS appear : JFK , EDITH PIAF , LEE HARVEY OSWALD , and PATSY CLINE . Each is framed by an archival news photo of themselves in the background . Each is caught in a defining gesture in a column of light . The following is spoken in rough unison , in a staggered manner , sometimes led by one of the Ghosts , sometimes by another : a spoken fugue . Each ghost is trying to make sense of the numbers , to remember a combination forgotten . JFK &amp; PIAF &amp; OSWALD &amp; CLINE Nineteen sixty-three , Nineteen thirty-six , Thirteen ninety-six , Sixteen ninety-one , Ninety-six thirteen , Ninety-three sixteen , Sixteen thirty-nine , Sixty-three nineteen , Sixty-nine thirteen , Sixty one thirty-nine , Thirty-one sixty-nine , Thirty-nine sixteen , Thirty-six ninety-one Thirty-nine sixty-one . . . A wash of light . Music is heard : Patsy Cline singing " Crazy " on a distant radio merging with the Ghost of PATSY CLINE , singing live . The WITNESS steps forward , as JFK , EDITH PIAF , and LEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following . . . WITNESS I am standing on a corner and I hear Patsy Cline has died . March , 1963 . I hear " Crazy " coming through the radio , and the ache in her voice has never seemed louder and I feel my stomach hurt . Kennedy is on the TV and he 's giving a speech , and I can barely see him . I never see him . He always seems faint to me . But Patsy 's real . She 's realer than anybody . And my mind goes : nineteen thirty-six , sixteen ninety-one , nineteen sixty-three . . . And I think where am I ? How could I be listening to " Crazy " now ? Before Beverly D'Angelo and Jessica Lange get a hold of it ? Before I even know who Willie Nelson is ? This is a corner in New Jersey . 54 North 11th Street . It 's gray . But this is n't where I was born . I was born in Philadelphia : The Liberty Bell , Betsy Ross , and all that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of the museum and I raise my arms like " Rocky , " only that movie wo n't come out until years later .

Can you name this ? " Cat . " Yes . Good . You 're fine . " There 's nothing wrong with my brain . " Next child . " The Beatles play " I Wan na Hold Your Hand " right in my ear . I put the transistor radio right up against my ear . I hear the whirring of the mechanism inside . Grinding . Buzzing . But the Beatles blast through : sings p. 3 " I wan na hold your hand . . . I wan na hold your hand . . . " I am standing on another block . Another corner . This time I hear She sings line from chorus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Take your lover by the hand . " But it 's not the Beatles . It 's someone else . A group . Faceless . But with a sneer . In rock n ' roll , there 's always a sneer . Elvis taught us that . A woman named Christine Keeler sleeps with a man named " Honeybear " and then with a bald guy named Profumo who hides his head behind a folded-up newspaper . I think to myself " Does he sell perfume ? Why is he called Profumo ? " What a fusty name . Fust . Is that a word ? Okay . The doctors have determined there 's nothing wrong with my brain , but I should wait a couple of days before I go home . A couple more days in the incubator . Thirteen ninety-six , nineteen thirty-six . . . Remember the Depression ? Okay . Cocoon . Bubble . Respirator . Hold me . My fingers small , and soon on my hips standing on the corner of 54 North 11th Street , and crazy . Music fades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLEASON , JACKIE KENNEDY , BOB DYLAN , and ANDY WARHOL .

And outside : the ice cream truck . Bells . The Good Humor man always drives by at two o'clock . The GOOD HUMOR MAN appears in light .

I try to catch the ice cream man 's eyes , but he 's got his head down in the barrels inside the truck . He starts to pull away . I hit the side of the truck with my hands , beating on the face of Good Humor . The GOOD HUMOR MAN looks at her . The truck stops and I point to the strawberry shortcake bar which is pasted on the outside of the truck along with the chocolate clair and the almond one that tastes like butter . Ick . And the Good Humor man shakes his head and says p. 8 GOOD HUMOR MAN Sorry . All out . GOOD HUMOR MAN laughs , and fades in light .
