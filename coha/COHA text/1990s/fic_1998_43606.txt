On her deathbed , as she drew what were to be her last breaths on God 's green earth , the old woman made a confession so terrible to her husband that-even under circumstances as solemn and sorrowful as these-he could hardly take the secret as true , let alone forgive her for it . He listened by her side , as if struck dumb with a club , and when she pressed her lips tight against admitting anything more and a silence had passed , a long silence in which she could hear herself swallow away the brackish taste in her mouth , the taste like wet pennies off the street , just when she expected the final lifting of the veil to all her life 's meaning , the old man hiccoughed . <p> It might have been the fever in her mind , but she could not accept this to be her life 's reward , and she lay there and blinked her eyes and half expected her husband to cough up an olive pit . She watched for his lips to purse and spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startle of his hiccoughs came , haphazard and loud in the room . She could feel each jump telegraphed through the bedsprings to her , and finally she asked him to go drink some seltzer water . She lay flat and let her eyes close to the dim room and tried to savor the slow lift and release of each breath in her chest , and on into the night she lay at rest and at peace . <p> But she did not die . <p> Contrary to all they had expected and provided for , in three days ' time the old woman was sitting up in bed and answering her mail . Scattered about her lay books and dishes and flower arrangements , bowls of ripened fruit , her little radio and reading lamps . The curtains and windows were opened wide . And on the morning of the fourth day the doctor clocked his tongue and pronounced , almost begrudgingly , that she was quite recovered . The undertaker came and rolled the casket and wreaths out of the old couple 's parlor , where she was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingered so long after him in the room that her husband lit matches to kill the scent . <p> Improbable as it became , in two more days the old woman 's appetite for chocolate and red wine returned . And her husband knew she was truly well when she asked for a pot of coffee and a bundt cake . As he ventured to the bakery , he caught himself whistling-it was a brilliant spring morning , after all , and he breathed in the cool air like water and stopped to look out over the hills in the distance , the clouds driven across the sky by the blue clear winds that never touched the ground , and all the trees in leaf and flower , and the traffic of people out walking and working , the report of hammers and whine of saws , the spring birds on the grass , the wet grass in the sun the color of old yellowed silver-and on he went walking for her cake , the thought dawning on him that soon she would be up and off to the market herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like usual , her Tuesday bridge ladies , her Thursday museum committee , her Friday reading to the blind . <p> The old man 's heart became divided after his wife 's almost being carried off . On the one side , all his prayers had been answered in full : his wife alive , their world restored , and the warm sun of another spring upon them . What more could he ask for ? And yet , in ways he could n't help , her confession of the thief lay heavy on the other side of his heart . And this half grew increasingly heavy as the days passed . He began to fancy that he had somehow been tricked by life , a thing he had never before thought possible . <p> Perhaps as a consequence of this division in his heart , or as a result of the wear of his wife 's illness put upon him , or even the peculiar strain of her growing wellness upon him , or the gout in his ankles when it rained , or the ceaseless passing of friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the troubled rags of feeling old and dull to the world . . . whatever the reason , all the things in his life grew increasingly strange to the old man . He would glimpse-or would think he had glimpsed-fruit bats hanging folded with the coats in the closet , turtles in place of pillows on the couch . A pair of boots became muskrats under the bench in the hall , then they were dachshunds , and then , a step closer , they were boots again . <p> As the days passed , the old man went around braced against the world . He did n't know if he believed what he saw or saw what he believed . Was it what you saw or what you thought you saw ? Or was it that what you believed in your mind was what you saw in the world ? He did n't know the way he used to know , or thought he had known , and it exhausted him to chase his tail like this . He often had to lie down on the daybed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world would be revealed to him . He did n't trust his heart could take it . <p> On the face of it , of course , the man and his wife were destiny 's darlings , not so much the envy of the little mountain town as its collective hope . You would have to be blind not to see the care and craft of the old man 's silver shop . Not to allow that the woman 's reprieve from death smacked of miracle and meant she had purposes unfinished in the town . And despite her years and her children all far-flung , would n't anyone say-among the many things people said-that the old woman appeared more radiant and unshakable than she had in months , if not years ? <p> And when she walked into town , she looked less frail in her summer frock than anyone could recall , her basket on her arm as she went , her hard heels on the sidewalk . And everyone who stopped her on the street told her how impossibly glad they were when they heard there 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly touched wood ) , she 'd never felt more , well , sprightly . <p> And they said yes , was n't sprightly just how she looked ? And they would hold her away at arm 's length and say how they wept for joy . Then they would bend close and ask had she gained weight and snuck off to a spa ? What , they whispered , are those new teeth ? <p> The old woman would blush to the roots of her white hair and throw back her head , brim with the pleasure of a schoolgirl , really , and she would switch the basket of collard and turnip greens to her other arm and keep smiling . " Oh , now , " she would say , " come sit ' n ' tell me how you 've been . " <p> And they would sit to lunch and gossip in the sleepy shade of the market 's trees , a drift of carnival music turned from the blind organ grinder , to whom she read on Fridays , and whose swift little squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimes and nickels-everything really was like usualthe pranks of the monkey , the storm crabs for sale in the cages , the ice and fish and roasting nuts and seeds , the smell of burnt sugar and salt , and the warm coins in her one hand ready to give to the laughing monkey , her wallet clutched tight in the other , because she knew how the monkey , too , was a thief . <p> Home from the market she walked with her basket of greens and dinner sausage , a newspaper packet of sunflower seeds and a bottle of red wine , and the notion to tell her husband of all the household scandals she had heard and of how she had watched the monkey sneak his tail around a little boy and tip the boy 's cap over his eyes . And as she went toward home she watched the sky for stray birds and for her old lost-to-the-world Romeo . <p> The sun settled behind the trees , and she stopped in a small garden park and set down her basket and rubbed the aches out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit water up over its head onto its back . She waited and watched the sunlit fingers of the highest tree branches . And softly she whistled his name , rustled his seeds against the newspaper , and again more boldly she called to him . <p> The air went powdery toward dusk , and she heard the slow ring of the vesper bells , and still there was no Romeo . She knew much better than to hope , but each stir of shadow in the damp air made her turn and call his name and see and know , despite her best hopes , that her thief was not there . <p> The old couple 's history came back to them , if it returned at all , like a story they had heard about or read about somewhere long ago , the memories scarcely their own anymore , unspooling about them like rhymes for children . Once upon a time , and the old man-a young man then , still sticky with the things he touched in life-would go walking in the Lost Woods near his boyhood home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest in the path . In the leaves lay a crow , black and folded open , its feet cut off . These days were days , back then , of great superstition and antique cruelty , days where local farmers poisoned whole cribs of corn to feed migrating birds , the birds thought to be omens of famine and death . For many years , you could pay your taxes with salted owl 's eyes and crow 's feet . Springtime brought festivals to the little towns , where cannons shot nets over fields of birds and children ran to club the struggling beasts with ribbon-tied broom handles . Many birds grew skittish over these years and learned not to sing . Some were thought to fly out to sea to become fish . And fewer and fewer returned each season , yet it was true that afowling parties still combed the woods every weekend and holiday and shook and chopped nests down from trees-no eagle , goose , or crane , no crow or lark escaping unharmed . All that remained of some species-the Scarlet Hurry Hawk , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller than jellybeans and sweeter than marzipan , or even the Passenger Pigeon , easily the most numerous bird on earth , so prolific its flocks hid the sun for hours on end , the cooing and the whirring of wings so loud that the firings of a gun could not be heard-these birds had only their names and the faded specimens behind the smudged glass of the museum cabinets . <p> But once upon a time , when the old man-a young man-came across the nest with the crow like an umbrella , the man could n't take his eyes from the perfect circle of twigs and sticks , at the broken eggs and the glint of tinsel in the cup of grass . And whenever he thought back to this , the old man would see himself standing mesmerized by the milk-green egg in the hold of the nest , one egg as smooth as a moon opal , and as empty and marvelous . <p> He would remember not a speck of sound disturbing the woods , the quiet columns of trees , the pools of light falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no wind . And when , as from a dream , the man awoke and removed his sweater and stooped to wrap the nest , he heard leaves rustle above him . And as he carried the nest back through the woods , carried it like a boy carries a bowl full of soup , he hoped to high heaven that his young bride at home would know what to do with a thing such as this . <p> Hatch and raise him-was it ever a question ? - into a silk-black crow , so perfectly black he moved like oil . Their orphan Romeo , they would keep him safe and teach him to speak and fly and to eat at the dinner table . And he learned to waltz and purr on the outstretched paws of the cat , and in the parlor at night the man would teach Romeo to sing like the nightingale , like the chaffinch , like the sparrow , like the gentle playing of the late-night radio , the piano and the soprano so like birds themselves . And with her knitting halted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's knee , the bird 's knuckle-skinned feet grabbing the man 's trousers , her husband 's eyes closed and head tilted , the bird singing and looking back and forth to him and to her , as though they were tossing something between them . <p> And in the mornings , after the man arose and washed and readied himself for the silver shop-where day after day he hammered the town hallmark into the clattering piles of knives and forks and spoons , so many spoons you would have never imagined mouths for all the spoons-Romeo would fly alongside him as he walked the road to work . And after the bird hurried home to the woman , all the rest of the morning long she would tidy the house and chatter on to her Romeo in what would start out as gladness at his safe return to her and what would amount , in the end , to a steady pour of loneliness . <p> By the time their children arrived-two boys , two girls , each a year apart-and by the time the children were half grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many things had come to pass in the couple 's life together , many things in what had seemed to the woman just a heap of idle days , days scarcely strung along together where not a thing appeared to happen or change or move and where time , if it existed at all , was the thinnest of strings suspended and invisible , with no end to hold the beads of days which slid clean off the skin of the world , as if they had never really been , or better still , as if they had always been , fleeting and eternal both . <p> She could n't quite get her head around this paradox-of time 's being something entirely different than her experience of it-nor did she try particularly hard . It struck her simply that the old man 's silver shop had always put the tableware in homes this side of the mountain . And no one had ever before read to the blind until she was there to read on Fridays . It was all like asking when Romeo had become her thief exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romeo had not so much learned to steal as he had forever stolen . <p> Just as sure as the sun crossed the day , the old man would arise and wet his head and go to work each morning to heat and shape the sterling bowls and caldrons and the endless and loud piles of cutlery . And each morning Romeo would fly along with him and perch from tree to tree to sing the songs of the whippoorwill , the bullfinch , the forktail , the bluebird , the naked-throated robbybell-it was a long walk-the songs of the whiskey-jack , and the waxwing , the waxbill , and as the man unlocked the door of his shop , Romeo stood balanced atop the roof 's peak , singing his catalogue of night lieder from the radio . Then , when he caught the first sweet whiffs of coal smoke from the chimney , Romeo would start home to the woman , who had already seen the children off to school and sat on the porch with her coffee and cake . <p> He knew she would scan the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And always he would come to the porch and walk his nodding walk , his toes clicking on the wood ; he would bow for her to come scratch the nape of his neck and to rub his feathers against the grain , as so he liked , and he would begin to purr . And when she reached out her hand to him , palm up , Romeo would open his beak and place into the cup of her open hand a child 's jack , or a bullet shell , a long necklace of pearls with a gold hasp , an earring , a heavy brass plumb bob , a crucifix , a pair of golden mustache scissors . . . <p> Each became a gift picked special for her , and the best of these prizes set to motion the scandals she brought home to her husband from the market each day . An eternity ring from the stable boy , the young man disappearing with the ring , his employer 's horses falling ill and nearly dying from , of all things , grief . A gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caravan leaving a bitter curse on the town that would scatter all the children to the winds far from home . There was a heart locket , which undid a promise and the lives of two young lovers . And there was the pair of platinum-rimmed eyeglasses taken from the jeweler , the man stumbling to his death out the open window of his studio , a scatter of uncut diamonds cast about his body in such a way that people said he must have become , through long practice and labor , the very stuff of his art . Even the holy priest requested that the undertaker eviscerate the jeweler for hidden gems . In the weeks that followed , children would throw stones at the glass blower to see him shatter , the banker would snip off his little finger with a cigar cutter , the aged silversmith-the old man 's mentor-would be bound to trees in the woods , his veins opened so that his blood could be drawn and cast into coins . And the town would never rise out of its shame to breathe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest his soul . <p> Many years passed in this way-the town secrets tied to and tied by a crow and a thin old woman-and anonymously she parceled her hoard to the museum and library and church charities . She gave to the organ grinder and quietly stirred the silver brooches and rings into her husband 's foundry pots , which cooked in the center of his shop . And though she wanted only to tell her husband the real secrets beneath the secrets she brought home from the market , she did n't know how to explain so he would understand . <p> Even when she confessed and felt the weight of the world lifted , she could n't dare tell how she held the picture in her mind of Romeo flying through the woods and town-a complete shadow-flying over the trees and streets for that glint of gold that he could bring home to her . She fell in love with that idea , fell in love so deeply that no matter how wrong and weak and terrible she knew it was , no matter that the longer she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become , until even a lowly tin soldier or a bell off a cat 's collar was enough to break her heart for an entire afternoon , she fell in love so deeply that nothing could bring her to deny herself her thief , nothing could bring her to deny herself the idea of him flying through town , a chain swinging in his beak . <p> And when all the years had passed , when even Romeo 's feathers had gone lusterless and grayed , the old man still worked the spoons in his shop and Romeo still flew as her thief . And at night , as she tucked the bird into his cage to sleep , Romeo would purr and coo back to her the voices and soft words of each of her children , the sighs and coughs of her husband , the squawk of the kitchen door being opened and closed , her own voice saying " Pretty bird . " <p> And she would whisper , " Yes , Romeo , pretty-pretty . " <p> The old man no longer slept well , especially during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napping on the daybed . He could sleep during the short winter 's days with the noises of the street to distract his mind from the bellows-like wheeze of her breathing and the pauses which he feared would not end . <p> When she had first taken seriously ill , their children all swarmed home with their caravans of spouses , pets , children , toys . And yet , as their old mother 's illness dragged into the spring , they begged off and returned to jobs in scattered cities far away , each traveling with silver goblets and cutlery from the front hutch and sideboard . And as the nights passed , the old man sat in the room alone again with his sleeping wife , listening to her labored breaths , and he thought it funny how none of the children had mentioned Romeo 's absence . He thought this showed how deeply they grieved the imminent loss of their mother ; but later , in the smaller hours of night , he took it more as a measure of the distance and time between them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt when , in the sober bright of the next days , he could see that not one of their children had become a friend to them , that he and his wife had passed all their years with his apprentice , with his wife 's bridge ladies , with each other and work and Romeo , with the town market . <p> He did n't do anything with this sadness , unless allowing it to wash over him was doing something , unless traipse-wandering through the Lost Woods with packets of seeds counted for something . And though he feared him dead , the old man whistled up to the trees and looked for the bird 's crushed bones amongst the ferns and the wood-roses , and all the woods held quiet around him , the clouds in the sky through the leaves far above like the breaking surface of the sea , the spears of light as though through water . And with a swell of sadness again and of sympathy-for the birds and his wife and Romeo and his friend the vintner and the numberless sufferings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and his hunched-over life of silver and chasing tools-and there in the woods the weight of the crow seemed to rest on him , that unmistakable weight of Romeo on his leg , light as a bird is light yet is n't light , and the old man found himself singing the night songs until his throat was red . <p> No Romeo came to him , and with his boots wet-through from pushing aside the morning ferns , the old man started home and a flash caught his eye , a baby 's bracelet . He brushed the dirt from it and hurried home all full of pride-sticky as pine pitch againsmiling to hold the little prize out to his wife . She would fly to him , he thought , her eyes all alight for him . But instead she screamed so fiercely that he thought she was in pain and dying right there . She clutched at the bracelet , and he tried to cover her with blankets . " What have you done with him ? " she cried , her face tight and scoured-looking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Her words fell on him like mallets , and the old man stuttered back to her how , in the woods , by chance , he 'd found the bracelet under a fern , with other ferns . He pointed to the toes of his boots , as if he needed more proof , and took mushrooms from his coat pockets and cupped them in his hand . He held out a tiny pine cone from his breast pocket . <p> She looked at his feet , the brown boots dark with wet , and she lay back heavily and brought the gold metal to her face , touched it to her tongue , and tried to catch the humid smell of Romeo on the bracelet . She did n't look to her husband , even when he sat down beside her on the bed and took her hand and toward his weight she tipped slightly and poured-until she closed her lips again tight against anything more-her life 's confession out to him . <p> The old man would go to his grave wondering what more he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spring upon them . And yet , as the days passed , he found himself unable to be roused from bed , unable to venture far from the house , and many mornings he would lie in bed , staring at the window , trying to listen to his heart as he would the sound in a seashell , and his mind would flit in and out of dreams and memories , the difference between the two no longer important for him . <p> What 's more , the old woman had become well with a vengeance . Her appetites restored and habits renewed , she went out each day and bounced as she stepped down the sidewalk into town . The old man watched her go , her white hair shining in the sun . And he watched , and kept watching , the empty street . A little breeze came in the window , and the curtains waved up and bowed down slow before him . And when the old man stepped outside into the light , he thought diamond necklaces hung on the wet grass . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears of stars ? <p> Stand up straight , old man , he said to himself . Enough . <p> And he would turn from where he stood and go back inside to lie down on the daybed and look at his dry , spotted hands until he had chased himself inside out . He looked through the window and curtains and was back to watching as the sun-with all the patience and fortitude of the mountain and woods-did its work of turning the shadows of the lamppost and the tree up on their ends , of holding those shadows there , and then of gently laying the shadows out again opposite . And dusk brought the vesper bells and the approaching click of his wife 's heels on the walk , the heavy creak of her basket filled with dinner greens and fruit , the old man 's heart chanting that the trouble 's no trouble , the trouble 's no trouble . . . <p> And over dinner and wine he listened as she chatted cards and told how , in the market , the monkey tipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirate story to the organ grinder and could swear the monkey was weeping when the parrot in the story was captured by the mutineers and was made to stand trial against his captain . <p> In the living room , late into the night , they sat and listened to the radio . Sometimes they would remember the past for one another-their marriage trees as saplings , their trip to Barcelona-but mostly they just remained quiet together in the room , the man absently turning through a book of still life paintings , and the woman 's knitting halted on her lap as she stared at the dark empty windows , the soprano on the radio rising onto her toes , her piano slowly falling to the floor-and coming to rest-like a leaf . <p> " You know who'd 've liked that song ? " he asked her . <p> The needles in her hands began to tick together again up and down , and she looked over at his finger running along the edge of a page , and when she raised her eyes to his , he winked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the skein tumbling on the floor . <p> After the next song-a waltz that had been popular when they were courting-she said , " That was n't so bad , either , was it ? " <p> " Incredible , " said the man . He hummed just slightly and closed the book on his lap and watched as she knit . He lay aside the book . " Know what I 'd most like to be in my next life ? " <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " A musician and play like that : ' <p> " I 'll see what I can do , " she told him . <p> He sat down . It was a joke and he had been sitting right along , but he sat down even more , as though forcing air from his body to touch bottom . He sat heavy in his old bones and looked at her . He had been looking at her all along , all his life he had been looking , but he looked more-and she was a wolf with knitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lost in gray hair and old lady clothes , knuckles swollen , and then again , what , old man , who was she besides the only one you 'd ever love in this life of clattersome spoons and singing crows ? - and sudden and soft he had landed in this chair in this room in this night . A smile floated up to his face all by itself , he could feel it rising in his cheeks and eyes , this brightening , and he found a laugh starting out of him , and soon he was laughing in that big easy way some men have , men of the moment who can shake off their troubles by the door and let out that **31;957;TOOLONG laugh , which rattles bottles against barroom mirrors . <p> When she started to say something , to apologize , he rose to his feet and took her hand and led her out to the porch , where they stood together and watched the night , the black trees , the moon , the stars so close you could stir them with a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they closed up the house and went to bed , it being so late , but the man had a tickle in his throat and could n't sleep in the quiet and began coughing . He got up and went to the kitchen for seltzer water and lemon . In the silvery moondark he sat at the kitchen table and cleaned his teeth with a toothpick . <p> That morning-the sunlight streaming into the house through the curtains , the birds outside singing-when she went to the room with the daybed , she carried a tray with their coffee and juice and muffins to him and found that , during the night , he had died . <p> There was consolation to be had in the busy details of the wake and funeral , in the playing of host to friends and family , in the attending to train schedules and sleeping arrangements . An odd , quiet solace also crept into the old woman 's answering of sympathy cards and her writing of money orders to the churchyard and stone carver and undertaker , that cologne of his carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other corner someone waited to keep her distracted with lunch in the market , with gossip , with invitations to dinner . It struck her that everyone-in a fit of pity-conspired to let her never be alone again . <p> And as the old woman withdrew from them all , they would talk of how she carried her grief-so sad , they said , silently worrying over their own ends-and they would turn their leading questions to the organ grinder , for he was believed to have second sight . What with his accent and those cream-clotted eyes and the littleman monkey over his shoulder , who would not look twice at the man and feel the cool , root-cellar air of an oracle about him ? Well , the bridge ladies , for one , could n't care less and complained mostly about forgetting their cards . And of what concern was it to the museum committee , their anonymous donors all but vanished , bankruptcy staring them in the face so close that by the middle of each month they had to rent out their halls to wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ grinder , either , to whom the old woman still read on Friday mornings , even though she wondered if he still cared to listen . It seemed to her that he would awaken only when she stopped reading or digressed from the story . <p> " Excuse me " he would say , " but it says that for real ? " <p> And she would smile over to the monkey-who crouched so attentive in his little mustard-colored suit-and she would return to the page and clear her throat before she picked up from where she had broken off . The man wanted only ghost stories , of late , and the more avenging the justice , the more haunted the conscience , the better . And the monkey would snort at each turn , at each squeaking door and midnight romp he would somersault in his seat , and a dull guilt would tie up the old woman 's neck , as if her reading held within it something mildly illicit . With the bright morning and the chirping birds , the stories of grave robbers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to see the monkey squirm in his seat and begin to clap as she reached lunchtime and the end of the tale , where the ghosts all marched onto the waves to their foggy ships , that was fine . And as the monkey clapped , the organ grinder opened his onionwhite eyes . " Brav-o ! " he said . " Brav-o ! " <p> And she whiled away the afternoon with lunch and coffee and the organ music in the market , the crabs and roasting seeds and fruit stalls , and the water-cool shade of the trees by the benches where she sat and met the usual passersby , whose pity she despised more and more with each smile and new scandal that came her way . And closer to evening , the old woman sat out on the porch with her wine and chocolate and the sun behind the trees , the branches in strong tangled shadow . It was autumn but the light was warm , and she waited for night to fall as birds flew home to their nests . She carried sunflower seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Romeo and his soft return , which she had once seen in her mind so clearly , a smudge of black against the horizon , his raucous flying home at one time so fully imagined to her , it seemed already fulfilled somewhere-the roll of his wings , the fanned spread of his tail , the silky hiss of his feathers , the tick of his feet upon the wood porch . <p> ' Hello , bird , " she said to a grackle in the shrub , who tipped his head and looked to the seeds she was holding out in her hand . <p> She said , " Take some , " and the bird squeaked a rusty gate of a song and flitted to a branch in a tree , slightly higher , and the old woman stood and came forward with her hand out . When she was close enough to see how his eye shone yellow and how his black feathers glossed purple , he whetted his beak and then twittered to a tree near the street and turned on his perch and watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past the post office and fire station and market , her bird before her in the tree just distant , past houses and smells of dinner , past the cemetery and church , she followed tree by tree until they were beyond even the railway station and he was gone from view . <p> The sky darkened left to right over the town , over which the moon also rose , nearly full , bright and clear enough to cast shadows . And into the gutter the old woman pitched the seeds from her hand . Beyond the shuttered market stalls , she could see the glow of lights against the museum facade . Every light must have been on-the whole place alive with light-but not a soul stood on the steps at the entrance , no guard or coat-check with his arm draped over the ancient lion in the foyer . Music , yes , and the muddled drone of voices and glassware from the ballroom , like some empty and haunted ship , the old woman feeling dose to invisible as she turned at the suits of armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with royal tapestries , the music and voices fading behind her , only the occasional burst of a girl 's laughter flying after her , as though released . <p> At the end of the hall , double doors with portal windows stood dark , and when she pushed them , all their heaviness swung easily and silently aside and opened onto her favorite of all rooms in the museum . The doors closed behind her and she let her eyes adjust to the dim light of the room . All was quiet . And slow and gradual , the sponged clouds came clear on the high-domed ceiling , and once more she was in the company of the gulls and kestrels suspended and the wandering albatross hanging there on wires above her . <p> She walked beneath them-the big wheeling birds under clouds-to the wall of bright cases , each holding a bird as posed and half-real as a painting of a bird , a painted bird under smudged glass and glare of lights . The last known Passenger Pigeon , who had been named Martha , sat alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , at the woman , at the other birds . And next to her , as remote as the rest , the Bourbon Crested Starling sat on a branch , holding a cricket in his beak forever , accounts telling how this bird could be batted down with a yardstick , it being so trusting and tame . And the old woman came to the Great Auk and could practically hear him say his name as she stood before the antique specimen , his feathers soft as velvet , his wings spread , her hand on the glass as if he could be frightened away . She passed the Mysterious Starling and the Paradise Parrot and the Rodriguez Solitary , who looked so delicate and alert that she had to remind herself that these birds-the Spectacled Cormorant , the Chatman Island Rail , the Bonin Wood Pigeon , the Society Parakeet-were all hollow inside , all staged , stuffed , and dead to the world . <p> And at the end of the room , and at the window , the old woman watched herself in the glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash and lifted open the window , the weights in the walls banging , the night dark outside , the air cool , the sounds again of a party , the stars , the streetlamp moon . And what was so wrong with admitting it , admitting that she would love to fly home right now like a bird ? That she would have given anything to go dark through the black air , instead of having to walk past the tuxedoed thickwits splashing in the fountain after the gold fish , the bare-shouldered women giggling as they held the men 's shoes dry in their arms . That the insolent look of the night guard with his feet up on the desk , that look enough to crush her , those eyes enough to make her feel more small and lonely-if this made any sense at all-lonely for her life when it was as yet undiminished , for the vanishing of her life behind her . <p> She walked home cold under the moon-which had two blue rings around it , meaning frost-and she was home again , her red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the chocolate and fruit . She took everything inside and sat in her chair and hugged herself with a heavy shawl wrap until her teeth stopped chattering . She stared tiredly at the room , the fireplace , the radio , the rug , her husband 's empty chair , her basket of yarn . And she did n't know , in the end , how to sit without hope , how to sit without wishing for his return , for her Romeo to open his beak and place a necklace in her palm and return to her all the many voices she had grown so lonely for . <p> She heard the rumble of a train running through town , and then all was quiet again . She raised her palm to her mouth to taste the salt , and she heard mice in the walls . Far away a dog barked . And she must have fallen asleep , for she was awakened by the scratching in the kitchen . She feared the mice had become rats , their clawings so persistent that she took the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , and the noise stopped . At the counter she checked that the flour and sugar jars were closed , and when she turned to leave , the scratching like tapping began again . <p> Then at the back door , his hand on the screen , she caught the little gray face in the bottom corner of the screen ; it was the organ grinder 's monkey in his mustard-colored suit , and she smiled and let him in . " My , my , " she said , " what a surprise ! " <p> And the monkey climbed up on the counter and held out his hand to shake . <p> " And what brings you here , you little rascal ? " <p> The monkey 's smile widened as he went across to the table and sat down , his tail coiled around the chair back . He crossed his legs like a gentleman . <p> " Well , then , " she said , " may I offer something to eat ? " She set the table and began putting out cheese and crackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit and wine , and the monkey nibbled at a pretzel and never took his eyes from her . And when she sat down , she offered him chocolate and began her talking . She told what amounted to a long pour of days and once-upon-atime memories , the monkey listening rapt , her voice stopping only long enough to refill a glass or crack a nut for her little friend . <p> Then , in the distance , they heard the voice of the organ grinder up the street . " Do n't do this , Archie , " he called , his voice breaking and raw . " Come home , please " <p> Neither the monkey nor the woman moved . They stared at one another , and the man passed the front of the house . " Arch-ie , please , " he called , and neither the monkey nor the woman seemed to breathe , they held so still . <p> " Bad Archie , " said the man . " You 're a bad , mean monkey . " <p> And when the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked out on the street to see the organ grinder , blind and bareheaded , stumble like a drunk along the gutter in the cool moonlight . The old woman turned to Archie and watched him sleeve a butter knife , his thin brown hand taking up his glass by the stem and placing it back down in the ring of wine on the tablecloth . <p> " Now , Archie , " she said and sat again , " where were we ? " <p>
