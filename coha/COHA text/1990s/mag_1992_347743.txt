To hungry pike as well as hungry humans , carp can be a most satisfying meal . But the freshwater fish has a way of fooling at least its piscine predators . According to researchers at Lund University in Sweden , when pike are placed in carp-filled ponds , the hunted fish begin to bulk up on food in the water until , after 12 weeks , they are simply too big for the pike to swallow . But the bigger carp expend more energy swimming . Once the pike threat is gone , the carp should revert back to their slimmer shape . Call them the Arnold Schwarzeneggers of the deep  --  at least for a while .
