Yellowstone struggles to retain its tranquility amid growing demands for winter tourism <p> THINK OF an isolated frontier in the dead of winter . You are in the Rockies-northwest Wyoming , to be precise , the least populated state in the nation . <p> Before your eyes , herds of bison trudge across a sweeping snowscape , leaving behind only temporary furrows that disappear into funnels of wind and dunes . Nearby , geysers puff their vaporous steam until crystalline pebbles of hoarfrost collect on bows of lodgepole pine . <p> Then , abruptly , the spell of silence is broken . First you hear the hum . Finally , you see a fleet of snowmobiles accelerating past a futuresque , tank-like vehicle called a snowcoach . Even in this remote area of Yellowstone National Park , these machines are a part of the daily ritual during winter months . For photographer Steven Fuller , there is a paradox in cherishing the winter environment of this 3.500-square-mile sanctuary and sharing it with the outside world . <p> " It is n't a matter of whether people should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , but how , " said Fuller , who lives in Yellowstone year-round . Eighteen years ago , Fuller was hired to look after several hundred tourist cabins at the Canyon Village development . After raising two daughters in the park , he still resides at Canyon with the romantic employment title of " Winterkeeper . " <p> " Even in the remoteness of a Yellowstone winter , " Fuller said , " space and emptiness , void of machinery and the smell of gasoline , are rapidly diminishing quantities . Tranquility is what brought people to this relatively hostile environment in the first place , and that 's why , I assume , people will continue to come . <p> " But one of the great luxuries of 20th century America is to be out of sight or mind of other humans , " he added , while skiing through a forest of lodgepole pines burned by the 1988 fires . " I 'm afraid that once we humans finally figure out how to preserve the beauty of Yellowstone in winter , there will be no way to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irretrievable ; it will be gone . " <p> But 25 years ago , the decision was made to develop Yellowstone as a winter destination . " If we 'd known then what we know now , " said Yellowstone Park Superintendent Bob Barbee , " we might have done things differently . " <p> At the time , fewer than 1,000 tourists journeyed into Yellowstone each winter , most of them on curious recreational machines called snowmobiles . In what many park observers consider to be a major miscalculation , no one in the Park Service expected the snowmobile industry to grow so large so fast . Nor did park planners know that winter visitation via snowmobiles would balloon sixty-fold . " In their wildest dreams , I doubt that anyone could have predicted it would grow like it has , " Superintendent Barbee theorized . " But we ca n't turn back the clock . Winter recreation in Yellowstone is here to stay whether we like it or not . " <p> This year , a record 105,000 visitors are expected to tour the park in the winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snowcoaches , while 25,000 other visitors , many of them cross-country skiers , will drive to trailheads along the park 's only plowed highway between Mammoth , Wyoming , and Cooke City , Montana . Within just two decades , the number of people staying in the park 's two hotels during the winter has risen from fewer than 700 to 34,000 . <p> Park officials predict that visitation will continue to grow 50 percent throughout the 1990s and then level off . Conservationists , however , are skeptical , saying Yellowstone is underestimating its potential for growth , and the time for confronting the impacts of winter tourism has already arrived . According to David Simon , natural resources coordinator at NPCA , parks all across the country , Yellowstone included , are already " venturing onto thin ice " with winter use . <p> " No longer can the park ignore the environmental consequences of winter tourism , which is running out of control and has been since it started , " said Don Bachman , program assistant with the regionally based Greater Yellowstone Coalition , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Yellowstone area . " It is clear that the change from a millennium of solitude to a generation of noise and activity has resulted in negative intrusion upon wildlife and the very essence that makes winter in Yellowstone unique . " <p> Conservationists say the increasing scope of winter development combined with strong political pressure to build additional facilities stand not only to harm the park 's aesthetics but could prove deadly to wildlife already stressed by the harsh weather . Some 2,200 bison and several thousand elk live in conditions where the mercury routinely drops to 40 degrees below zero and mountainous meadows are buried by six to seven feet of snow . In the 1980s , Yellowstone began seeing a phenomenon in the winter that normally only occurred during the summer-bison jams , in which tourists inadvertently surround buffalo to get a closer look . Wildlife biologists also say that the extra energy expended by animals when they are frightened off roads by snowmobiles and skiers is dangerous because many elk and bison barely survive the winter on stored fat supplies . <p> TO RELIEVE SOME OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter Use Plan for Yellowstone and adjoining Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller Parkway this spring , with plans to finalize it in early 1991 . Implementation will follow contingent upon congressional funding . <p> Unprecedented in its focus , the plan is significant , according to many conservationists , because it will shape the way winter tourism is approached in the Yellowstone area as well as in other national parks such as Mount Rainier , Glacier , and Rocky Mountain . Park Service officials feel the pressure will be on soon to develop these parks as winter recreation spots , too . <p> Largely at the urging of NPCA and other conservation groups , the Park Service has agreed to define the level of visitation , or carrying capacity , the park can handle without being harmed or degrading visitors ' experience . In its Winter Use Plan , the Park Service pledges not to expand winter development unless it can demonstrate that increased visitation will not advesely affect the park . <p> NPS defers implementation of the carrying capacity study , however , for as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over those years and will not cause unacceptable impacts , said Yellowstone 's Park Planner Kevin Brandt . <p> " I like the idea that people can come here in the winter and see the features of Yellowstone but with a whole new twist , " said Brandt , who worked at the Old Faithful development for three winters . " By the same token , I 've seen bison and elk being run down the road by snowmobiles . At some point , that probably gets to be too much . From what I 've seen and read in reports , we 're not at that point yet . Still , you never have as much data as you 'd like . " <p> Terri Martin , NPCA 's Rocky Mountain regional director , said that the park 's decision to implement a carrying capacity study is a major step in the right direction , but that it should be implemented as soon as possible . " Why speculate about whether or not existing or future visitor use levels are harming park values ? It makes more sense to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed when they arise . " <p> Under the National Park and Recreation Act of 1978 , Yellowstone is mandated to define acceptable thresholds on tourism . The Park Service , however , has failed to establish carrying capacities . As a result , NPCA has spent several years developing a state-of-the-art carrying capacity methodology designed specifically for use by park managers . The guide will be published this year . <p> " The objective of carrying capacity is not to lock people out of parks , " said Laura Loomis , deputy director of conservation programs at NPCA , " but to assure that visitor use patterns and levels do not harm the quality of visitors ' experience or degrade park resources . Carrying capacity begins with clearly defining the kind of experience and environment the park is there to protect , and then taking steps to assure visitor activities do n't harm those values . At Yellowstone , we need a carrying capacity program to protect the park 's pristine environment , vulnerable winter wildlife , and a visitor 's opportunity to experience the park 's stunning natural quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , however , are caught between political forces who want to expand the regional tourism industry and conservationists who want to ensure that winter development is guided by protecting the park and its wildlife . <p> While total winter visitation pales in comparison to the 2.7 million people who drove through the park in the 1990 summer season , the economic stakes are high . Studies show winter visitors spend twice as much as their summer counterparts , and park gateway communities are spending millions to lure more people into the region . <p> The town of West Yellowstone , Montana , which sits on the western edge of the park , bills itself as " the snowmobile capital of the world . " Snowmobiling in the national park forms the center of the town 's commercial marketing strategy . Similarly , business interests in Jackson Hole to the south , where 225,000 visitors converge to downhill ski in the Tetons , acknowledge Yellowstone as a primary drawing card . Meanwhile , tourism officials in Cody , Wyoming , on the park 's eastern boundary , have pressed for expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic pie , which is conservatively estimated at $6 to $10 million annually . <p> Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan and U.S. senators Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop have drafted a half dozen letters to Park Service regional chief Lorraine Mintzmyer during the past year seeking financial support for expanded winter development . Tourism officials in Cody , backed by those politicians , have asked the Park Service to winterize unused summer facilities at Caynon Village and transform the development into a destination center for snowmobiling and cross-country skiing . <p> Ironically , the proposal was greeted with hesitancy from Yellowstone 's largest concessionaire , TW Services , which oversees hotels at park headquarters in Mammoth and at Old Faithful . Because of high operating costs , the winter concession operation struggles to break even financially , even with Old Faithful 's 100-room Snow Lodge boasting 98 percent occupancy . " That could change with several ski areas in Montana trying to turn themselves into destination resorts and promoting Yellowstone , : said Steve Tedder , chief of operations for TW Service . In comments submitted to National Park Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter visitation of only 100,000 , additional facilities or areas should not be opened , " he wrote . " At this point , there is hardly enough use of existing facilities at all park locations to financially support the operation . Unless the National Park Service plans to increase winter visitation , expansion of overnight facilities and other services would only dilute the existing business . " <p> Despite Political Pressure Yellowstone released a draft plan last spring , which calls for no new winter development inside the park , instead focusing on rehabilitating Yellowstone 's winter facilities is no small proposition . In proposals submitted to the National Park Service , planners asked for $20 million to repair buildings , upgrade emergency oversnow vehicles , and import equipment that can hold the enormous amounts of trash accumulated at Old Faithful that ca n't be trucked out until spring . The biggest cost is a $9.6 million reconstruction of Snow Lodge . <p> Conservationists were pleases with the Park Service 's decision to hold the line on new facilities . They agree , however , that NPS clearly caved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail through Grand Tenton National Park . <p> Backed by Wyoming 's governor , its congressmen , and the national snowmobile industry , the Divide Trail would extend 370 miles from central Wyoming to northern Yellowstone . It would become part of the longest groomed network of snowmobile trails in North America . To establish a link through Grand Teton 's major highway because this road is plowed in winter . <p> " The constitution of a snowmobile trail through Grand Tenton , even if it is alongside the road , presents unacceptable environmental safety , and budget impacts , " said NPCA 's Martin . Martin believes that inexperienced snowmobilers are likely to slide off the trail and collide with vehicles on the plowed highway . She points out that the trail will require the cutting of roadside trees and construction of new maintenance buildings and housing in the park . It also may lead to future widening of the highway , Martin said . <p> Conservationist also object to the cost of the trail-$2 million to construct and $250,000 annually to maintain-an exorbitant and unjustifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , the proposed trail violates Park Services regulations , which confine snowmobiles to unplowed roads and waterways that are used by vehicles in other seasons . <p> Yellowstone 's Brant , who is helping draft the joint park development plan , says he never expected the issue to become so devisive . " It 's been an interesting experience trying to provide information to such divergent interests , " Brant said . " The key , of course , is to strike a balance between resource enjoyment and resource protection . With the controversy surrounding this winter development plan , we 're learning how to achieve some middle ground . <p> " Nobody 's expecting us to put up a Taj Majal winter resort in the middle of the Old Faithful geyser area , " he added , " and we 're not proposing to lock the gates and keep people out either . We have to find the balance . Everyone has their own definition of solitude . " <p> Finding that balance , Martin said , is not as simple as use versus preservation ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with preserving natural values . Otherwise , she said , society will be incrementally destroying the values of the parks that the nation set aside to protect . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : From a millenium of solitude to a generation of noise and activity : Yellowstone 's serenity is threatened by the park 's growing popularity as a winter recreation spot . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Already stressed by the harsh weather , animals are frightened off roads by snowmobilers and skiers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The number of tourists riding through Yellowstone on snowmobiles has increased sixty-fold in the past 25 years . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Many bison barely survive the harsh Yellowstone winter . <p> By Todd Wilkinson <p> <p> Todd Wilkinson is a freelance journalist based in Bozeman , Montana .
