<p> The lawyers for Theodore J. Kaczynski have a problem , and the problem is their client . <p> His attorneys believe Kaczynski is mad . <p> So do at least two psychiatrists they hired , who probed the mind of the former mathematics professor and found a deeply delusional , paranoid schizophrenic who was convinced " that every aspect of his existence is controlled by an omnipotent organization against which he is powerless . " <p> So does his younger brother David , whose tip led to the arrest of Kaczynski as the alleged Unabomber , and who hoped the federal government would help his troubled brother and not seek to put him to death by lethal injection . <p> Yet with a jury of nine women and three men seated Monday and opening arguments in the trial against the alleged anti-technology bomber scheduled to begin Jan. 5 in Sacramento , legal experts who are following the case say Kaczynski is resisting his only real line of defense : the introduction of evidence that might show he is haunted by the phantasmata of a deranged mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But such psychological evidence , as it bears on guilt or responsibility ( as opposed to punishment ) is a very tough sell with today 's juries , according to trial attorneys and forensic psychologists . <p> Despite public perceptions that insanity pleas are common , they are in fact extremely rare and usually result in plea bargains in which the prosecutors and defense both agree that the defendant is mentally ill . <p> But high-profile insanity cases  --  John W. Hinckley Jr. , Jeffrey L. Dahmer , John E. du Pont , Lorena Bobbitt , John C. Salvi III  --  tend to be remembered by the public . Hinckley and Bobbitt were found not guilty by reason of insanity . Juries rejected insanity defenses for Salvi and Dahmer . Salvi committed suicide in prison ; Dahmer was killed by another prisoner . <p> " The public gets educated by the media paying attention , but the public draws profound conclusions that are often false , " said Peter Arenella , an expert on the insanity defense and professor of law at the University of California at Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But it may be the only defense , however partial it may be , that Kaczynski 's attorneys have . FBI agents uncovered a trove of evidence in his Montana cabin , including virtual signed confessions and a signature completed bomb . <p> U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr . said after hearing motions in the case this week in Sacramento that he would rule later on how much psychological evidence will be allowed in the trial . But Kaczynski attorneys Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke have signaled their desire to argue that their client suffers from " a mental defect , " specifically paranoid schizophrenia . <p> Toward this end , they have had Kaczynski 's one-room cabin trucked from Montana to Sacramento as evidence . They plan to guide the jury through the tiny structure where Kaczynski , 55 , lived for two decades , without running water or electricity , and offer the cabin as a window into his mental state . <p> They may also attempt to use Kaczynski 's own writings  --  the journals , manifesto and letters  --  to show that he harbored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , are the very same writings that prosecutors will use to show that Kaczynski was a cold , calculating killer who knew exactly what he was doing . <p> Kaczynski 's attorneys are not arguing that their client is incompetent to stand trial ( he clearly is participating in his case ) , nor are they pursuing a traditional insanity defense , in which they would try to convince the jury that Kaczynski was so mentally impaired that he did not know right from wrong . <p> Instead , they are pursuing a variation of a " diminished capacity " defense : meaning he may be shown to be the Unabomber but not to have the legal " intent " to kill . <p> Kaczynski himself steadfastly refuses to concede that he may be mentally ill , which in itself is further evidence that he is paranoid and delusional , according to psychiatrists who have spoken with him . <p> And so the stage is set for a trial in which his attorneys may work to introduce elements of insanity  --  but very , very carefully . <p> " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Howard Zonana , professor of psychiatry at Yale University and medical director of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law . <p> A glimpse of that dilemma , and its explosive potential , was seen last month during a hearing in which one of Kaczynski 's lawyers , Gary Sowards , argued that his client is mentally defective and too paranoid to submit to examination by government psychiatrists . <p> During the hour-long discussion , Kaczynski became highly animated , furiously scribbling on a legal pad and constantly whispering to Clarke . At one point , he threw his pen across the desk . It was his single outburst to date . Otherwise , Kaczynski has sat alert at his defense table , even smiling at the occasional moments of levity during the month-long jury selection process . <p> Because of Kaczynski 's refusal to submit to neuropsychological tests by government examiners , the prosecution has argued that his defense team not be allowed to introduce evidence of mental illness during the guilt phase of the trial . Psychological evidence , however , would be allowed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty . <p> During this week 's hearing , Sowards said , Kaczynski offered to undergo limited psychiatric testing for the death penalty phase of the case , should he be found guilty , and withdraw a mental defect defense in the main trial . Prosecutors rejected the offer . <p> Kaczynski has not only refused to be interviewed by government psychiatrists but has been reluctant to work with specialists brought in by his own lawyers . <p> David Foster , a psychiatrist , stated in court documents that he reviewed the voluminous Kaczynski writings  --  personal journals , correspondence , collected news clips , treatises on technological society  --  and spoke with his family . <p> " Mr. Kaczynski 's writings , " Foster wrote in an affidavit , " cover a span of nearly four decades from adolescence to his arrest and chronicle his delusional thinking . Social isolation and preoccupation with delusional themes such as mind control , civilized society 's efforts to destroy him , and annihilation by technological society are consistently found in his writings . . . . Mr. Kaczynski chronically views accidental or intentional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances , commercial and residential development , air traffic , and radio and television broadcasts as threats to his survival . " Foster also visited five times for periods of up to three hours with Kaczynski , a Harvard-trained mathematician , former Berkeley professor and later hermit . Foster stated that an essential component of Kaczynski 's paranoid schizophrenia is " his deeply ingrained fear of being considered mentally ill . " The defendant considers psychiatrists to be agents of mind control , according to Foster . <p> " Upon broaching with any degree of specificity the symptoms and course of his illness , " Foster said , " Mr. Kaczynski became visibly upset and shortly thereafter discontinued the meetings . " <p> Another mental health specialist , psychologist Karen Bronk Froming , also met twice with Kaczynski , who she said " was intent on doing well on the testing and assured me nothing was wrong with him . " <p> In his writings , Kaczynski himself confesses his disdain of being labeled " a sickie . " He told Froming he would submit to her tests only to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broached the possibility of mental illness , he refused further contact . <p> " Mr. Kaczynski 's superior intellect should not be confused with sound mental health , " Froming stated in court documents . " While his intelligence enables him to think in more elaborate and convoluted ways , and to appear verbally intact superficially , his inferences and logic are clinically distorted . " Froming said she found her subject in deep denial . Government prosecutors , however , have unearthed correspondence showing that between 1988 and 1993 , Kaczynski sought psychological help several times . <p> Kaczynski wrote a number of neatly typed , cogent letters to mental health specialists in Montana asking for counseling via mail . He confessed in his letters to suffering from insomnia , suggested something was wrong with him mentally , but disdained " talk therapy " and " psychoanalytic theories . " <p> He asked instead if he could send $ 5 and a self-addressed stamped envelope and exchange letters with a therapist . It does not appear that any such exchanges took place . <p> If Kaczynski 's lawyers are barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guilt phase of the trial , they still may be able to suggest he was mentally ill through other witnesses and evidence , such as his brother and his cabin . <p> If he is found guilty , however , Kaczynski 's lawyers most likely will attempt to introduce his mental state as a mitigating factor  --  perhaps enough to spare him from the death penalty that prosecutors are seeking . <p> " This is one of those cases where you may have a recalcitrant client , and that is a dilemma , both strategically and morally , " said Richard J. Bonnie , director of the University of Virginia 's Institute of Law , Psychiatry and Public Policy . <p> What if the client refuses a possible psychological defense , even to ask for his own life ? " The way our law works , the client gets to make the decision , " Bonnie said . " Even if making strategic error . " <p> Prosecutors say the Unabomber is responsible for three deaths and 29 injuries in 16 bombings . Kaczynski is specifically charged with 10 counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has pleaded not guilty .
