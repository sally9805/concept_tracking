( PAMELA , an upright woman of forty-five or more , wearing a Toronto Blue Jays cap , is sitting on a chair beside a huge pile of baseball books and a telephone . The cap looks both incongruous and correct . It should appear that she is sitting in a large , impoverished , ancestral home . PAMELA seems to be from another time . She speaks to the audience as if they are a group of people that have paid fifty cents to be toured through the house , and have asked a leading question , like , " How are you ? " ) PAMELA I wake up in the middle of the night , and my heart is pounding , and I 'm overcome with feelings of loss and terror and horror and panic and horror and pressure and terror , and panic , and my mind races to see where I was in my dream that would bring me to such a state . Then , I remember  --  I was standing at the plate , and thousands of people were chanting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . " My team-mates behind me in the dugout were chanting , " Hit that ball . Hit that ball . Hit that ball . " It 's the bottom of the ninth . It 's all resting on me . And I know I 'm not going to hit that ball . As I lay there alone in my bed , I realized I 'd had my very first baseball nightmare . And I thought , surely now he 'll call . The light changed that day . There was the wet rain and the damp and the sliding about on the packed icy surface , but it did seem that an almost imperceptible change occurred , like the turning up of a dial of light . The turning of the season . The time when John used to look for the very first baseball magazines . You know the ones I mean ? They 're not very good , they 're made of newsprint and they herald the later abstracts and larger tomes that come out throughout the season . These magazines were like daffodils or tulips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Training . ( She looks towards the phone . ) I knew he would n't call in winter . I knew he would n't call Valentine 's Day . Ridiculous , the way it comes right in the armpit of winter . There 's no more depressing time of year . No , he has no use for those kind of occasions , the bleeding hearts in the store windows , the silly , humorous cards , " If you break my heart , I 'll break your face , " and so on . No , I knew he would n't call then . He 'll call in the spring . Or the summer . Or at the very latest , fall . ( She looks toward the phone again . ) I 'm aware that it 's ridiculous , being a virgin at my age . I should have just gone out and done it a long time ago and got it over with . But oh no , I had to wait . Still , I do n't know why everything has to be done at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They begin with a triangle , a circle , a square . They move on to a bowl of fruit , an apple , a pear . . . eventually a banana and then they go on to paint the " Blue Boy " and " Pinkie . " Of course it 's possible that some people just are n't very highly sexed . As if there was a kind of a gauge  --  with " nymphomaniacs " on the top , then " highly sexed , " " very sexed , " then just plain " sexed , " " lightly sexed , " all the way down to " barely sexed . " When I told my psychiatrist my baseball nightmare , he said something I know he 's been dying to say for a very long time . He said that this dream might mean that I was gay . This disturbed me , not because of any prejudice , but because I 've never felt particularly gay . But I told him that I 'd be willing to seek a second medical opinion and if they concurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with qualified professionals for several years if necessary . Still , it did n't feel quite right . It 's true , I never had boyfriends as such . Of course , I had the experience of " that dance . " You know the one I mean . My mother went out spent three hundred dollars on a dress . You know , in the fifties they had those dresses with the crinolines that stuck straight out ? In bright green taffeta and I weighed two hundred and four pounds . And then came the snow boots  --  large brown galoshes with soles as thick as bricks . I clomped into that dance carrying my shoes in a little bag . I saw the girls , batting their eyelashes and giggling and listening to the boys talk about sports , pretending interest  --  you know , the way women do . I was n't going to do that . I made for the couch and sat there watching like a giant frog . I was n't going to eat anything . I was n't going to drink anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just sat there and waited until it was over and then I went home . This is all that 's left , a giant house , some moldy antiques , a small annuity . I 've always liked to keep a room in my house empty , actually , not a room , an entire floor . I thought that if I filled up the whole house with things  --  with my voluminous collection of books on the female orgasm , the works of the modern French feminists  --  Angst : volumes One , Two and Three  --  with lamps and tables and things , then there would be no room for him when he came . I thought a lot about it that spring three years ago , inviting John to come and stay . I 'd had my eye on him , but then I 'd had my eye on other fish before . And I thought , " This is the way it 's done . The woman has the nest and provides , and the man is in between things , he does n't have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's done . " So I said to John , I said , " Well , if you do n't have a place to stay , you can always stay at my house , you can pay me two hundred and fifty dollars or . . . nothing . " And he said , " Sure . " The way they do . " Sure . " I sat in my kitchen waiting for him to come , and I wish I had known then about Sadaharu Oh . Sadaharu Oh was perhaps the most successful hitter ever . He hit more home runs than Hank Aaron or Babe Ruth . A Japanese man , he was a high school star until he hit the major leagues and went into a giant slump . He just could n't hit the ball . He 's in despair . Finally his teacher comes to him and says , " Oh , you must learn to concentrate on ki . Ki is point of spirit energy in the body . " Now , I would have thought that this point of ki would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the forehead or the mouth or , at the lowest , the chest . But no , it appears this point of ki is located . . . all the way down . . . about two inches below the navel , right down near the " Canadian parts . " And so Sadaharu Oh learned to concentrate on his point of ki and balance his spirit energy and still he could n't hit the ball . His teacher came back to him and said , " Oh , you must understand and eliminate the mah . Mah is energy between opponents . " In this case the pitcher and the batter . Sadaharu Oh had to learn never to think of the pitcher as his enemy . He had to think into the eyes of the pitcher , through his own eyes in a giant circle thus eliminating the mah between them . And he learned to do this and still he could n't hit the ball . Then , it 's terrible , they 're about to throw him off the team and he has one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and says , " Oh , you are a piece of shit "  --  the way they do . " You have one last chance . You must hit the ball standing on one leg . " Sadaharu Oh thinks he 's crazy but he does n't have any chances left , so he agrees . He goes out to the stadium to face the fans . They are so used to him striking out that every time he comes up to bat , they chant , " Oh , strike out ! Oh , strike out ! Oh , strike out ! " But he quiets them in his mind , concentrates on his point of ki , eliminates the mah between himself and the pitcher , and raises himself on one leg in the now familiar " flamingo stance . " ( She stands on one leg . ) He waits for the perfect moment , hits the ball with a resounding crack , it arches up and out of the park ! He runs around the bases , hits home plate , and flings his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two years . And the crowd chants , " Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh . . . Oh . . . Oh . . . Ohh . . . Ohhh . . . Ohhh . . . Oh . " ( The chant becomes rather orgasmic in nature . ) I sat in my kitchen , waiting for John to come , with some Lapsang Suchong tea in a perfect china cup , and a fresh strawberry tart with whole wheat crust  --  of course made from scratch  --  and I heard the doorbell ring . I looked down the long hallway and saw him through the glass , a huge black shadow with a suitcase . I waved him in and he walked down the hallway , coming closer and closer , looming larger and larger , seeming to cut out all the light behind him and . . . all of a sudden . . . all I can see is . . . the enemy ! ( She leaps up on the table , shrieking . ) A man a man a man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penis ! A rapist ! A warmonger ! An oppressor , a brute ! And I know all I 'll want to do is serve and serve and serve . I see forty-five years in one fell swoop . He is old and bald and has cancer and I 'm changing his colostomy bag . I want to take a piece of chalk and make a giant circle on the floor and say , " No ! You ca n't come here . This is me ! This is my mind , I fought for it ! This is me , you ca n't come here ! " Instead , I say , " Come on in . Take a beer from the fridge . " Of course , I 've stocked the fridge and the cupboards and the freezer with enough food to last seven nuclear wars . I know that he must feel my panic and yes , my . . . revulsion . But how could I tell him that although these things are true , he is also my beloved ? He moves in up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled by the very genes up to the third floor  --  just do a bit of dusting , not to move anything around , and I see his dirty laundry scattered on the floor . I 'm moved to pick up one of his shirts and smell that unbelievable combination of polyester blend and sweat . Just to get used to him , you understand . I 'm further moved to gather up the shirts  --  not the socks , only the shirts , and carry them downstairs and wash them and then to say casually , " Yes , no trouble really , I had to do a black wash anyway . " And it is as if we 've lived together for forty years , it 's that comfortable , that ordinary , at the same time there is this unspeakable tension between us . Then one day he comes in and he says , " Do you mind if I watch the game ? " Game ? What game ? " The Blue Jays and the White Sox . " I say , " Sure . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the living room and as I turn on " the game , " I hear that sound  --  the hard-edged announcer 's voice , the sound of all little girls being separated from their fathers . The voice says , " The Blue Jays are in the Skydome and they 've opened the roof . . . and they 've closed the roof . . . and they 're opening the roof . . . and they 've closed the roof . . . yes they 've opened , no they 've closed . . . " But I ca n't watch the game . I am only aware of him behind me on the couch , it 's as if the back of my head has eyes . I know he 's wondering whether or not he can puts his boots up on the couch . And I want to beam out to him , that of course I dearly want him to feel comfortable enough to put his boots up on the couch , at the same time , I feel that if he does , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contented sigh , stretches himself out on the couch , and puts his boots up . I tell myself , " You see , the world has n't fallen apart , the boots are up , so what ? " But I still ca n't watch the game . All I can think of is , " Does he want tea , coffee , pound cake , lemon meringue . . . any of the enormous meal I 've prepared and hidden in the back of the fridge ? " No , I ca n't watch the game . Then I think , is it possible that perhaps at this very moment , he is also thinking of me ? I glance at him . Wrong , wrong , wrong . He , of course , is only watching the game . I do n't know how many games we watched like that , without my seeing a single one . And I began to plot and plan the way women do , checking ahead in the television guide to see when the games were on , so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do you mind if I watch the game ? " Because the game would already be on . But we were , maybe only I was , exhausted with the tension and pressure of the unspoken between us . Then one night I was just fed up . He was n't home but I put the game on anyway and sat staring blankly at the screen . Then I heard him come in and get a beer from the fridge and I thought , " No , everything 's fine . This is how they do things . They come in , they get beers from fridges , they crack them open , they flop on the couch , they fart , and they watch the game . " But this night , for some reason , I was n't thinking so much of him . It was as if some dial of light is turned on , and for the first time I see these players , these White Sox . A bunch of men dressed in what looks like long underwear with numbers on them , loping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mouths like tumours , scratching and spitting great gobs of phlegm and tobacco juice and spit into some kind of trough that must be in front of them . A gang of fairly ordinary fellows , all shapes and sizes . . . and then , in come . . . the Toronto Blue Jays . . . warped and introverted and miserable . I think , " What 's wrong with them ? What have we done to them ? What have they done to themselves ? " The entire team looks like it 's in its second year of psychotherapy . As the game progresses , I understand more and more , till finally I know that it 's the top of the ninth , and that all baseball stories begin with , " it 's the bottom of the ninth or the top of the ninth . " It 's the top of the ninth and the game is tied and the bases are loaded and there are two down and the White Sox are up to bat and the Blue Jays are in the field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be losing his mind , quite literally coming apart at the seams . He gets a tragic , haunted look in his eyes and starts to twitch and shake in an almost Parkinsonian manner . Then he starts to pull at himself . And as if on cue , all the other players start to pull at themselves too . Now , the other players are more circumspect , they pull down and a little to one side , but this Dave Steib , he goes right for it . And then he starts to talk to himself and it appears everything is going to disintegrate until a calm comes over the entire stadium . Cito Gaston , the classiest man in baseball has come out to talk Dave down . He gets to the mound , and almost before he begins to speak , you can see the tension start to drain away from Dave 's face . He begins to regain control of his limbs , and do fairly ordinary things with his hands , like play with the ball . We do n't know what Cito has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well done , Cito goes back to the dugout to watch the game , sitting like Yul Brynner in The King and I. Dave strikes the batter out . The Blue Jays are up , and out comes George Bell , the most hated man in baseball . The Butcher of San Pedro . Clearly , George is a man used to boos . Booo booo booo ! " Eeeef the Canadian faaans do n't like me , they can keees my purple butt ! " " Booo . Booo . Booo . " But today , the fans are n't booing . They 're quiet , almost kind . It 's not putting George in a good mood at all . He looks like he wants to eat the plate , the bat , the ball and the pitcher . He swings , misses , and his statistics come up on the television set before you . And you know everything . You know he 's been in a giant slump , that he needs an eye operation , that his shoulder 's gone , his elbows are gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good either . . . we know his contract is up , that he 'll ask for too much money . Meanwhile the announcers are saying , " Perhaps George will get a single today . " And George raises his bat , big as a fence post , hacks and hews and slugs the empty air , strikes out , throws his bat to the ground with a curse and stalks off in a snit . Then in comes a large chin followed by curling blond hair coming to the nape of the neck , Kelly Gruber . Most young boys want to be baseball players and end up being policemen , Kelly wanted to be a policeman and became a baseball player instead . He 's holding his pinkie finger at an unusual angle , and his skin is stretched thin and taut over his cheekbones . It seems he 's been in a slump , and the fans are booing him , something about water skiing and a pinkie injury . With the black chalk marks smeared under his eyes , he looks like that rock singer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the plate , his lips thin with tension , and cracks the ball for a stand up triple . As he arrives on third base , you can hear him thinking , " Just let them call me Mrs. Gruber now . " Then , there is a curious dragging sound , a player appears to be dragging a giant cross onto the field , and on his face are tears from his latest appearance on Vision Television . He seems to be in a kind of shadow which hides his features more than his hat . Tony Fernandez is a man clearly tormented by the wounds of Christ . And I want to beam into the television set , " Tony , of course it 's all right to believe in Jesus and be tormented by the wounds of Christ . Just not right now , it 's the bottom of the ninth . " He clearly hears me because he seems to solidify , underneath his torment we see a body as neat and graceful as a young gazelle . He comes to the plate with no unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisibly whacks the ball and drives Gruber in ! We win ! We win ! At least , they win . . . the Blue Jays win . . . I win , John and I , we . . . we win . . . Yeah Team ! We 're very excited , John and I , because of the game of course , and it 's ten o'clock at night and it seems that something more could happen , that the evening could extend . But we do n't seem to be able to engineer it and I get almost Dave Steibian in my twitches as I say , " Coffee ? " " No . " " Tea ? " " No . " " Pound Cake ? " " No . " " Chicken breasts ? " " Broccoli with hollandaise sauce ? " " No . " Things are about to come apart at the seams when a calm comes over the living room . I turn and there is Cito Gaston , handing me a pack of cards . And Kelly Gruber has found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John and I play Crazy Eights by candlelight till four o'clock in the morning . Then , dawn just starts to change the light , it 's late , we are tired and yet it seems . . . that something more could happen with the evening . . . something more . . . there is a long silence , I look at him , of course I do n't speak , and then . . . finally he says , " Well , I guess I 'd better crash . " I say , " Yes . You should crash . " I should crash . We all should crash . We say good night , he goes down the hallway to the bathroom to leave the toilet seat up , then climbs the stairs to the third floor . Lying alone in my bed , I hear his heavy body fall on the mattress on the floor above me and I ache the way women ache when they want something they ca n't ask for . Then I hear a very curious sound . Like ice cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , sitting on the couch , is George Bell . ( Crying . ) " Agh , agh , agh , aaagh , agh , agh , agh , agh . . . Sheeet man . Sheeet . Everybody knows , man . They think I 'm feeneeesh . I 'm not feeneeesh . I got two years left in me , two years , and my contract is up . I got ta go out there and act like a king . My eyes are gone . My shoulder is gone . My knees gone . My ankles are n't very good . Cito , he says , keep our eye on the ball . I ca n't see the god-damn ball . Agh , agh . Agh . Aaaagh . " He looks up , sees me , and says , " Nice nightgown . " I go up to him , smooth as silk , and help him take the chips off his shoulders . First the left one , then the right , which is even larger . Then I am in his arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are travelling travelling travelling over me , finding places I did n't know existed . And all the moves I thought I would have to learn by rote or with professionals are coming in waves and waves and waves . He is no longer the Butcher of San Pedro , these are not butcher 's arms , but blacksmith 's arms and they are holding me so gently . Then . . . he touches me with the sweetest part of his bat , and we are . . . at first base . . . and we are . . . at . . . second base . . . we are . . . at third base . . . ohhh . . . home . Then I am curled in his arms and he is tickling me with his moustache . Now I do n't know if that was a proper orgasm . I do n't think anyone really knows what an orgasm is , certainly it 's not in all the books I 've read . All I know is that I was very pleased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I helped George strap the chips back on his shoulders , he says , " Pamela , they say I 'm pretty shitty guy , maybe that 's true , maybe that 's not true . But I tell you one thing , do n't you worry about this John . Just play your natural game . " And he was gone . I had a such a moment of peace , even the French feminists within were peaceful . Yes , of course , just play your natural game . But . . . how to be natural with Him ? I was becoming more and more unnatural . Seemingly unbidden , I was giggling and batting my eyelashes and wiggling odd parts of my body in coy ways . My voice had gone up octaves , I was running around like Betty Crocker in heat . Natural ? It seems natural when he goes out to say , " When are you coming home ? " Just like that , " When are you coming home ? " But when I say it , it comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to be home ? " I want to grab the words back . If I do n't say , " When are you coming home ? " there is an unnatural gap . There is no natural left . I 'm just a schemer now . And then , I think , " What he needs is a good shirt . It would look just like his other shirts , except it would cost two hundred and fifty dollars . He would n't be able to tell , they ca n't , you know . But fifteen years down the road , when he 's with someone a little closer to his own age , all the things from this time will have disintegrated , except for that one shirt , and he will think of me . " Just after the all-star game , he said that he was " getting it together " to look for a place again , and that pretty soon he would be off my hands . Again there was that silence . I just wanted to say , " Oh do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me marry me . I 'll nail your feet to a perch . I 'll nail mine to one . We 'll stay there immobilized forever , frozen forever , locked forever in this beautiful prison ! " But then I thought , " No , that ca n't be quite right . " Sometime after the Blue Jays lost the playoffs , he said that he was a little closer to getting a place and he pretty well had a line on one . Joe DiMaggio is standing at the plate . It 's the bottom of the ninth . It 's all resting on him . If he hits , the team will win the Series , he will break all the records . The crowd is electric , chanting , insane . The ball comes toward him and he waits for the perfect moment , swings , hits it with a resounding crack and it arches high over the park . He 's done it ! The crowd cheers wildly , everybody gets up to leave , the game is over . . . except for one outfielder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wall several feet when he makes the most astounding leap . He leaps up , arches back , reaches out that extra impossible quarter of an inch . . . and catches the ball ! The photograph of this moment shows the fans with their jaws dropped open , amazed that such a thing could happen . That outfielder never played baseball again . He opened a bar . Baseball stories are like that . They always seem to have that twist of lemon . Just after the World Series , which was hard to watch because , of course , the Jays had " choked in the clutch , " an expression I truly despise , John said that he had found a place and he could n't thank me enough and he owed me dinner . Even as he spoke I thought I caught something out of the corner of his eye , something that seemed to ask for something . . . but no , I was probably wrong . He is standing in the hallway with his suitcase and I am standing in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this nose coming toward me , looming larger and larger . I get what 's supposed to happen . I do understand the physics of it . Something has to occur so that our lips can touch . He comes closer and closer , and then . . . I do n't know why I did it , but I turned my head , I turned my head just a quarter of an inch and his lips brushed my ear awkwardly and a wall went up between us . A wall as cold and as grey as a Toronto sky in February . We try to reach our hands over the wall . I say , " Do n't worry about the rent . " He says , " I 'll give you a call . " I am standing under the ball . It 's one of those moments when the outfielder is standing directly under the ball , there 's no question that he 'll catch it . It comes closer and closer , looming larger and larger . . . and then , for some reason it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those ridiculous bloopers and there I am with my bum in the air , searching for the ball between my legs . I finally find it , too late to throw to third base . A couple of inches , one way or another . I hear the door close gently behind him . You can imagine what a meal the French feminists would make of such a moment . They 're very good in the politics , but about male/female relations , they 're very dicey , very dicey indeed . You can just hear them . " Oh , Philippe , Philippe , Philippe . I am woman . You are man . I am cunt . You are penis . I am penis . You are cunt . Oh , please fuck me . Oh , do n't fuck me . I hate you . I love you . I hate you . I hate you . Oooh , I will die if you leave . You will die if you stay . You must come , come , come , go , go , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I am not like that . I did n't get hysterical , instead I hid for at least a year , never leaving the house , and then one morning I woke up , threw open the window , smelt mud under the frost , and went down to the World 's Biggest Bookstore . Not Britnells 's where I usually buy my books , where the modern French feminists are given free rein , but the Worlds ' Biggest Bookstore , with its huge collection on the Royal Family , The Queen Mother 's Hats and so on . I walked in , some school children were milling about , and there he was , a nattily dressed Dominican man in a moustache and shades , flanked on one hand by a security guard with a gun ; on the other hand , with an overwrought , overachieving woman publicist . There were stacks of books off to the side and a long line of school children in front of him waving bits of paper , going " I got his autograph . I got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lined up with them . I was clutching a copy of Hard Ball to my chest . And as I got closer and closer to him , I felt my chest begin to heave and I thought , No , I want something more , something personal . I want him to write " To Pamela " in my book . When I finally got in front of him and I heard myself say in a shaking voice , " Could you write To Pamela in my book ? " And the overwrought woman publicist says , " No . He 's only going to write his name . " The man shook his fingers with the gold rings and wrote , " George Bell . " And I waited , for something more . Finally , he looked up and said , " Nice hat . " I left , but not completely . I found a vantage point by the section on the Royal Family , flipping through something about the Queen and her corgis and how they 'll never bite her fingers . George knows I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a baseball  --  you know how they like to have their baseballs signed with signatures of players  --  he 's got a ball like that and wants George to sign it . The security guard speaks in that tone policemen get , that over-politeness . " Sir , " he says to the lumpy child , " He 's not going to sign any baseballs . But if you want to buy a book . . . "  --  at twenty-four ninety-five . And the kid goes , " Ahh , come on . " And you know he 's living in some suburban hell in Scarborough , camped out in his parents ' basement , trying to keep his mind alive by quoting baseball statistics . The guard goes , " Sir , it does n't look like you 're going to take no for an answer , sir . " And all of a sudden , the child is escorted out of the store . Meanwhile George looks like he does n't understand English . Then it 's twelve thirty , the appointed hour is over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the security guard and the publicist are about to lead George off , he 's almost past me when I hear him say , " If you 're ever in the windy city , look me up . " Windy city ? And the lumpy fourteen-year-old , who has snuck back inside , says , " Yeah , did n't you know ? George Bell does n't play with the Jays anymore , he 's with the Chicago Cubs . And Fred McGriff , and Junior Felix and Tony Fernandez have all been traded . " Traded ? Traded ? I felt as if the ground beneath my feet was dissolving . What can it mean ? They were our team , those particular Blue Jays , not just any jays flying about the city . Can it mean he wo n't call ? And I am ten years old again and my best friend has moved away and the world is cracking cracking cracking there 's nothing left nothing left . But I pull myself together . The lumpy fourteen-year-old takes me over to the baseball section , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , give a copy of Hard Ball to the lumpy child , come home , and begin my training . The first spring of my training , I watched the Blue Jays build their new team . As I saw them bring in Joe Carter , his face splitting with that enormous smile filling up the dome , I worked on balancing the spirit energy of my ki . I was still having considerable difficulty eliminating the mah , between myself and just about everybody else , when I watched John Olreud , the man with no face , find a face , a girlfriend , and a batting average . As Mookie Wilson came and went I took to speed-reading my baseball books , learning that Yogi Berra once said , " Baseball is ninety percent mental , the other half is physical . " Still he did n't call . The next year I was more ready , even though I missed Fernandez and wished he 'd lose his shadow and come back . But it was Dave Winfield who walked into the living room and gave lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he asked the Toronto fans for " more noise , " I was able to stand on one leg for considerable lengths of time . I read that Babe Ruth once ate a hat , and that " The Iron Man " Lou Gehrig was obsessed with his mother , that Walter " The Big Train " Johnson , master of the fastball , used to give young batters a break , the catcher whispering , " The Big Train likes you today , " and somehow the ball would be right over the plate . As I devoured baseball stories , especially those with a sentimental slant , I watched Roberto Alomar , like a young bear cub , play the game with such ease it made me want to weep . Alomar took over Steib 's position as the player most likely to pull at himself without undue embarrassment . Nineteen times in one game , I think I noticed . And still he did n't call . Even though I felt fairly certain that the mah between myself and the world was significantly diminished . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Series looms ahead , I listen to the journalists drone on with macabre delight about " choking in the clutch " and the " curse of the Blue Jays . " " Cito ? Cito , stop chewing for a minute , and listen . I see how you 've built the team , and we all know where you 're trying to go . You want the big win , the World Series , entry into the Hall of Fame .
