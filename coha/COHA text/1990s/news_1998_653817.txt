<p> One thing is certain : Harold M. Evans at least looks busy . He arrives at the Waldorf-Astoria 's Peacock Alley for breakfast in a blur of flyaway hair and distracted energy , his briefcase bulging with that day 's Daily News , which he has already marked up with his scrawling critiques ( this article is repetitive , that one was underplayed ) . His manner is that of a charming , absent-minded British professor , the type of important person who needs to be introduced to someone he has already met several times before . <p> If people around town seem in the dark these days about just what he is doing , Mr. Evans says , that is just the way he wants it . " I 'm the invisible man , " he said . " And if people say , ' Harry 's doing nothing , ' that 's fine with me . " <p> Not long ago , Harry Evans lived in the public eye . As president and publisher of Random House 's trade group , he came to symbolize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary breakfasts at Barneys department store , multimillion-dollar writers ' contracts and paparazzi-chronicled party attendance with his wife , The New Yorker editor Tina Brown , made him the constant subject of speculation : " What 's Harry up to now ? " <p> Now the question is more like " Where is Harry anyway ? " <p> When he left Random House last fall and went to work for his longtime friend , Mortimer B. Zuckerman , it seemed to many in the media world that Mr. Evans had simply found a face-saving refuge in the nick of time . His new job  --  editorial director and vice chairman of The Daily News of New York , U.S. News &; World Report , The Atlantic Monthly and Fast Company , a business magazine  --  was widely assumed to be a way to bow out before Random House , weary of his high-spending , attention-getting ways , urged him out . His new job was seen as a comfortable place for a media phenomenon who turns 70 later this month to live out the twilight of his career . <p> Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Random House , which Bertelsmann A.G. is now buying from Advance Publications , was often depicted in the press . Indeed , he went to some lengths to challenge the conventional wisdom by threatening to sue a British newspaper for articles portraying him as pushed out of Random House . ( The newspaper , The Spectator , ultimately published an angry letter from him and Mr. Evans left it at that . ) He also says his low profile has been a deliberate attempt to feel out a new situation and begin to define his place in it . " Mort asked me to take six months before I did a single thing , " Mr. Evans said . " To study the situation . " <p> The study period is just about over . But what he will do , or try to do , is not clear . People working under him now generally agree that he is not much of a visible presence at the publications . They say that he flits in and out of The Daily News , the tabloid newspaper ; that he flies down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , about once a week , and that he has essentially ignored the other two publications : The Atlantic Monthly , a literary magazine , and Fast Company , a business magazine . <p> As to how Mr. Zuckerman feels about Mr. Evans 's contributions thus far , Mr. Zuckerman will not say much . " Harry is responsible for the editorial supervision , " he said . " That 's why I hired him . I do n't want to , in any sense , diminish his role by even talking about it . He and I have conversations , and I basically just support what he 's doing . " <p> But if Mr. Evans has a vision and has the latitude as Mr. Zuckerman maintains , he is in a position to make a significant impact , at least at The Daily News and U.S. News . Although The News recently won several editorial awards , including a Pulitzer Prize for the columnist Mike McAlary , it has been struggling to stem a circulation decline , particularly in its Sunday paper . And its attempt to shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new presses barely work and full-color images appear only on Sundays . <p> In an age of fast information , U.S. News continues to try to define its role as a newsweekly , particularly given that its competitors , Time and Newsweek , have advantages of greater resources and later closing deadlines . Moreover , just about every publication now offers the service journalism  --  " News You Can Use "  --  that had been a U.S. News franchise . ( U.S. News has a circulation of about 2.2 million ; Newsweek , 3.2 million and Time , 4.2 million . ) <p> One thing Mr. Evans has clearly been studying is the field of journalistic talent . He is in charge of hiring and firing at all the publications and has made no secret of having met with about 70 people in the media industry , leaving the impression that perhaps he is shopping certain positions around . " I 'm looking at candidates for every single slot for the business , " Mr. Evans said . " I always want to know who is out there and who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these meetings is uncertain . Mr. Evans acknowledged that the effort was something of a tease , given that he does not make his motives clear in many cases . " It 's like the three-card shell game , " he said playfully . " They do n't know where the egg is . " <p> Mr. Evans said some shifts could be expected . " We 'll have some changes of people eventually , " he said . " We 're discussing it . " <p> About the fate of two of his top editors  --  James Fallows , 48 , at U.S. News and Debby Krenek , 42 , at The Daily News  --  Mr. Evans is hardly Shermanesque . " I have no comment to make at this time , " he said . <p> Both editors have reason to be a little nervous . Churn has been a fact of life in upper management under Mr. Zuckerman . At U.S. News , Mr. Fallows 's predecessors within 12 years included Marvin L. Stone , Shelby Coffey 3d , David Gergen , Roger Rosenblatt and the husband-and-wife team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost fatalistic about his situation . " Like all of my predecessors , I serve at the pleasure of the owner or the owner 's representatives , " he said . <p> At The Daily News , Ms. Krenek is the fourth editor in less than five years . She followed Pete Hamill , who left in September after disagreements with Mr. Zuckerman . But Ms. Krenek said : " I do n't really worry about it . I feel that Harry is very straightforward with me . We do talk a lot , and I feel I know exactly where I stand . " <p> Despite being vague about her fate , Mr. Evans described Ms. Krenek as " a pistol " who has " enlivened the news section , " and he characterized their current working relationship as a collaboration . " I did n't want to edit The Daily News , " he said . " I 've edited every single type of publication as well as books . I do not want to get back inside the minutiae . " <p> Mr. Evans said he viewed The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and predicted that its circulation would rise in the fall . That is when he said he planned to beef up the business coverage , give a new emphasis to the opinion section , reorganize the sports pages and reorder the flow of the paper so that news pages are not so often broken up by advertisements . <p> Tinkering has already occurred at U.S News . On June 5 , the magazine announced a new science section , and Mr. Fallows said last week that the magazine would publish a redesigned " News You Can Use " section that is more clearly departmentalized  --  personal finance , health , technology  --  by the end of the month . <p> The magazine also seems to be moving away from featuring breaking news on its cover . Instead of the Arkansas school shooting , for example , the magazine featured an enterprise article on what life is like aboard a submarine ; instead of the death of Frank Sinatra , the magazine featured an article on why crime rates are down . <p> Mr. Evans does not seem to have much contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though reporters track his movements carefully when he is in the newsroom , trying to glean some significance from whom he stops to talk to . But several people in the upper editorial echelons said that if they had to choose , they would prefer Mr. Evans 's courtly input to Mr. Zuckerman 's abrasive meddling . " He 's a journalist , " one editor said . " He knows how to speak the language of journalists . " <p> Mr. Fallows said he communicated with Mr. Evans every day , by phone or E-mail , and discussed approaches to news coverage . Ms. Krenek also said she talked to Mr. Evans at least once a day . <p> Though Mr. Evans is perhaps best known in New York as a publishing man about town , in many ways his current job is closer to what he has done since he was 16 : print journalism . He established a reputation for tough investigations as editor of The Sunday Times of London from 1967 to 1981 . He resigned as editor of The Times of London in 1982 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of Conde Nast Traveler magazine in 1986 . <p> " He has tremendous newspaper instincts  --  the sense that newspapers are out there to slay dragons , " said Lars-Erik Nelson , The Daily News 's Washington columnist . <p> Given what Mr. Evans has accomplished and the fact that he has two young children and a new house in Bedford , N.Y .  --  in addition to an apartment on Sutton Place in Manhattan  --  one might well wonder why a man of his age would feel the need to take on anything new . <p> But Mr. Evans said he had no intention of slowing down . He rises at 6 A.M. and swims for 40 minutes every day . He recently completed his illustrated history of the United States , " The American Century , " to be published in October by Knopf , a unit of Random House . And he says he is having a wonderful time mucking around back in newsprint . <p> " I do n't know how to spell the word retirement , " Mr. Evans said , his cuff link catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My attitude is , I keep running . And somewhere in the dark there 's a cliff . And I do n't want to see it before I fall off . "
