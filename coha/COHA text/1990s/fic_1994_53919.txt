April <p> Owen shows up at my flat around midnight . He does n't knock , but I spot him waiting in lurk beyond the screen door . Outside , the rain jumps like pixies on the floodlit blacktop . His hair is soaked and his boots are muddy . <p> " Come on in , " I say , and he does , slowly . His eyes have that look they get when the cauldron inside his head boils . I wrap a towel around his head and clear some junk off the couch . Owen glances around and smiles , amused as always by the mess I live in . His own place is so clean and bare . <p> " It 's weird at home , " he says . " There 's somebody there . I had to get out of the house . " <p> I want to hold him then , but that does n't help . First I need to know what 's going on . " Think a minute , Owen . Is there really somebody there ? Or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in ghosts , Randi . " <p> " But you see them sometimes . " <p> Owen smiles a little . " It 's a real person . A girl . " He floats a hand out , winds the front tails of my flannel shirt into his fist . His thumb knuckle presses into my navel , and his fingers brush against my snakeskin belt  --  the one he made for me , three years ago . <p> " No , " I tell him . He lets go . I sit in the chair . Owen and I are lovers sometimes , when he 's thinking straight . He 's not a hunk , but his hands are slow as warm butter , and his mouth is like no one else 's . " So then , you want to talk about it ? " <p> " Her name 's Melissa . She 's sleeping . " <p> " Maybe . Maybe she 's loading your VCR in her car . " I fix our coffee . He likes lots of cream . " Do you like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he swallows hard . " I woke up and got scared . You know . I looked at her . . . " <p> I do n't ask whose face he saw . Mine , maybe . One of the ex-wives . So many others , I do n't want to know . In the old days he would call me by other women 's names . I played along ; I thought it was a game , and back then I thought games were cool . I did n't know then about Owen : the drugs , the jails , the dark and bloody maze of his childhood . I did n't know about the ghosts . <p> Owen 's confused but he 's trying hard , he sweats and blinks , and I put my hand on his . " She 's been there a couple days , " he says . " I thought maybe you could tell  --  if she 's bad for me . Or what . " <p> Owen used to trick me into running off his bimbos , then call me a jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise to be straight with me . I 've learned what to say : <p> " I do n't want to meet her . " <p> One hot July midnight four years ago , when I was still in my twenties , Owen sat beside me on somebody 's boat dock and showed me the scars on his arms . He had done them with cigarettes , he said , after his ex-wife left him . ( Later I found out how he really got them , pouring iron for brake shoes at the Rayco plant in Oklahoma . ) I told him about my own divorce , all that boring carnage that still seemed so unique to me then . We passed a bottle back and forth , trailing our bare feet in the moon-smeared water and watching skyrockets smash into green and gold fire above Bull Shoals Lake . <p> We knew some of the same people , and they had paired us up at a rockabilly club . He was my type : leathery skin , square , calloused hands , gray in his black hair . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track like the left one , but sat stonily fixed . " Randy , " he said . " That 's a boy 's name . " He squeezed my plastic lighter between his fists , then sparked it as he spread his hands . For an instant , flame swirled in his open palm . <p> We danced and sweated under those jagged lights for hours , then went for a ride . At some point it became easy to just let him talk , to lie back into the blur of his voice and let the words go . At some point it was easy to pull up my skirt and show him the tattoo on my hip , my green and scarlet feathered serpent . <p> " Quezalcoatl , " he said . " Aztec god of death . " <p> " It 's my sign , " I told him . " My coat of arms . " <p> Some people from the bar drove up then , and Owen got to rapping with a black guy who said he owned a leopard . <p> " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She might could die . " <p> " I ai n't a vet , Joel . I 'm a taxidermist . " <p> " You told me you went to vet school two years . " <p> " Yeah ? " Owen smiled just a little . I did n't know what that meant then . " Did I tell you that ? " <p> They drank some more whiskey , then started off , as if I were n't there . People forget me that way , because I 'm small and quiet . " Hey , " I called . " Can I come with ? " <p> Owen grinned at my Yankee talk . " Yeah , " he drawled . " You can come with . " <p> I think I passed out in the truck , but then we were at the fairgrounds , and there were rows of tractor trailers , and the sweet stench of manure and hay , and a tableful of roustabouts playing poker under moth-swarmed light bulbs . In a cage by herself , the leopard paced and let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her tail . <p> " She do n't act sick , " Owen said . " Something 's hurt her . " He pawed through a kit Joel brought him , dropping worn-out instruments to the ground in disgust . Eventually they knocked her out with a long hypodermic , and Owen pried her jaws apart and probed around inside with his finger . " She 's caught a needle in her pharynx , " Owen said . He cut it out with a scalpel , then stitched the wound . The blood and pus on his hands made me dizzy , and the next thing I remember was lying in the dark on a futon . Owen was beside me , eating something , watching TV with the sound off . " Where 's your stereo ? " <p> " I do n't like just music . " <p> He thumbed a cool strawberry into my mouth . " I took your dress off , " he said , " so it would n't get wrinkled . " <p> " Did we do anything ? " <p> " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wild with the cat . " <p> " I had two years of med school , " he said . He started massaging me , down my back and up my legs , rubbing me till his hands felt like part of my body , like my body was made of light . I let my eyes close and open , open and close . <p> " I can see through you , " he said . " Like stained glass . I feel like I know you . " <p> " You 're so full of shit , " I said . " Take off my panties . " <p> Owen and I saw each other a lot . I liked hanging out in his shop , watching him work on a deer 's head till the antlers shone and the brown eyes came alive . We went dancing , or drove out by the airbase and spread a blanket on a grassy hill , to drink a thermos of martinis and watch the C-130 's come in . But most of the time it was n't worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulked when I said no . He would n't show up for a date , and the next day I 'd hear he was at a party with some chippie . We were hot together , but he was n't my boyfriend . I could n't trust him . <p> When I got sober he was part of my old life , and I did n't see him . This year he started coming around again . <p> In the night I hear Owen walking around . I go to him , pulling jeans on first and making lots of noise so I do n't startle him . He stands at the window , backlit by the streetlight , watching the rain . His back is gnarled with tension and molten with sweat . When I say his name he does n't answer , just lifts his fist and starts hitting the glass slowly , a long breath between each blow . <p> " Stop it , Owen . Stop it . " <p> He stops then . Carefully I slip one arm around his shoulder . Then I notice what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when I got my own place . Owen had helped me pick it out , and he knew where I kept it . I take the gun carefully from his hand , check it out . It is n't loaded . I slip it in a drawer , under some linens . <p> " Do you know where you are ? " <p> He dares a glance over one shoulder , then looks back at the rain . " Your place ? But it do n't look right . " <p> " You 're thinking of the old place , the trailer . This is my new place . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " You want to sleep some more ? " <p> " Okay . " <p> I help him back to the couch . He tries to touch me , and I 'm glad I put on my pants . He 's not sure who I am . I do n't want him that way . <p> He tells me about his dream . " We were napping and you were teasing me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagina , only smooth flesh . See , you said . I told you . " <p> " It 's just a dream . " <p> " I love you , Randi . You know that ? " <p> " Do n't use the L-word , Owen . " <p> " I just wish . . . " He cups my chin , turns my face to catch the light from outside . " I wish that I could treat you better , " he says . " That you were mine . " <p> " It ca n't be that way , " I say . <p> He says , " I know . " <p> In the morning Owen cracks eggs one-handed into my iron skillet . I brush my hair in the living-room mirror . He cuts toast , squeezes oranges : everything appears with magical quickness . I sit to my basted eggs . The news drones on my countertop TV , sharp and clear instead of its usual muddy picture . Owen 's done something to it . <p> " So , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Are n't you dating someone ? " He just grins . <p> I take him home on my way to work . He likes my convertible . We play a game , his arms around me to steer and shift while I work the pedals . <p> " . . . so I dream I 'm on TV , playing Death Jeopardy . The host puts the knife by my ear and asks , When is New Zealand ? " <p> I clutch , he shifts . <p> " It 's Zen Jeopardy , " I say . " None of the answers have questions . " <p> " I was on it once , the real one . I won a thousand bucks . " <p> " Yeah ? " But I do n't believe it . He has that look he gets when he 's telling stories . Then he puts his head back into the wind and sings . When he was my age he sang with rock bands in Memphis and New Orleans , and under the whiskey blur you can hear the good voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the nightBut I could n't get it right , could n't get it rightKept on looking for a way to make it through the nightBut I could n't get it right Owen 's hillside house and workshop look the same as they always do : peeling boards , sheet metal roof , plastic he has n't bothered to rip from the windows . The same wheelbarrow and cement mixer still hulk in the gravel drive , the satellite dish in the backyard tracks its invisible god . As Owen gets out , his new girl opens the front door and stands there scowling . She 's just a kid . She 's wearing one of his shirts , and her hair is tousled , but she has on makeup . Owen glances at her and then back at me , his lips showing just the edge of a smile . He ca n't help out the clutch faster than I mean to ; gravel skitters behind my tires . Out on the highway I try to figure out why I started shaking when I saw her . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't really pretty . She could at least be pretty . <p> August <p> I 'm an airline ticket agent , one of those efficient and courteous voices who answer those 800 numbers . It 's harder work than you think . One 's eyes get tired of staring at ragged numbers on a video screen , and one 's flawless courtesy wears thin . You ca n't let up for a second , because the bosses spot-check you with their wiretaps . It 's a long day , and when I get home I want to drink . Instead , I go to meetings , and listen to more talk . <p> Tonight , for a change , I do some talking myself . I talk about Owen . After me , a woman named Sue says , " I 've been listening to what our sister here says , trying to get the logic of it . And while I do n't claim to know what 's right for her , I know a few things that have worked for me and for others in the fellowship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move away from anything that threatens your sobriety . You have to change your playground and your playmates . " People around the room nod amen . It sounds so cold to me , and I 'm getting pissed off , so I push back from the table and get some more coffee . She just goes on talking . " As for your friend , well , you know him , I do n't . All I know about him is what I know about everybody , and that 's that he 's got to find his own way . " <p> Finally she shuts up . Then this guy , one of the old farts with lots of sobriety , says , " My name 's Jorge and I 'm an alcoholic . " <p> " Hi , Jorge , " everyone says . <p> " I 've got a personal rule that works for me , " he says . " Never sleep with anyone who 's crazier than you are . " Everyone laughs . My fingers knot around the coffee cup , squeezing the ceramic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I get home the phone is ringing . I let the machine answer it . " My name is Melissa , and I 'm staying with Owen Rigdon . I 'd like it if you called me . Please . " <p> What the hell . I pick up . " Hello . What 's wrong with Owen ? " <p> " He 's acting kind of crazy . " She has a kid 's voice , cuddle-boppy . Just what he likes . " I wondered if maybe we could have lunch or something . " <p> " No . We ca n't . " <p> " He told me a lot about you . " <p> " Of course . " <p> " Maybe you could give me some advice or something . " <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> " You care about him , do n't you ? " <p> " That 's not your business . " <p> " I know . I 'm just worried about Owen . " <p> She sounds sincere , though how can you tell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sleight of hand usually leaves no trace . <p> I 'm dressed to beat her , sexy but discreet , like a lady lawyer . Nail polish , heels , a black dress that 's back in style . She 's tried to dress up , but does n't know how . Her skirt 's too short and her makeup too gaudy . <p> I like her , though . She does n't fool around with small talk . We get our salads , and she starts in telling her story . The cops come around , and Owen wo n't tell her why . He stays up for days , then sleeps twenty-four hours . He says he hears voices . <p> " How old are you , honey ? " <p> " I 'm eighteen . But I 'm old inside . I 've been through a lot . " <p> I tell her about the meetings . She looks puzzled . " Owen 's not an alcoholic . " <p> " Oh , he is n't ? " <p> " He gets wasted sometimes . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The problem is he 's crazy . " <p> " Well , duh . " <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " Sorry . But yeah , I know Owen 's crazy . Do you know how many shrinks he 's gone through ? " <p> " Owen went to a shrink ? " <p> " He 's been inside . Detox , shock treatments . And he was in prison , you know , before that . Armed robbery . " <p> " He never told me about that , " she says slowly . <p> I realize I 'm staring at the wine list , so I close it firmly . " Do n't you get it , honey ? He wants me to tell you . He wants us to worry about him . " <p> " Owen does n't know I called you . " <p> " I 'll bet he does . Anyway , I 'm not going to play this game . I can tell you one thing , though . You should leave . " <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way . But God , it 's hard to watch . " Then there 's one other thing I can tell you . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " Nine-one-one . " <p> " You mean the emergency number ? " <p> " You get it . Nine-one-one . " <p> October <p> Each day I get stronger . I do n't need to go to meetings anymore  --  all they do is talk and talk . I go to work at six and get off in the middle of the afternoon . At home , I sit on the porch swing and drink ice tea from a mason jar . This is a good place , I 've decided , this small town in Missouri I never thought to spend more than a month in . Now it 's been five years . This is where I belong , maybe . This is where I got sober . <p> Before I see it come over the hill , I recognize the deep hum of Owen 's truck . It 's a Chevy from the sixties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he climbs down , I try to size up his mood , like I used to in the old days . What I can see looks okay . There 's nothing weird in his smile , or the glint in his eye . <p> " Sit it down here , you dog . " <p> " You 're looking good . Healthy . " <p> He means it , and it 's true . I hold my shoulders straighter now , and my skin has a ruddy color . My blood pressure is normal . Each day I get stronger . <p> " So then , how 's that sweet girlfriend of yours ? " <p> " Drifted on . She wants to be a rock star . " <p> That sounds like a story , but I do n't ask . " Do you miss her ? " <p> " I du n no . I 've been dating . But it 's all gone flat , y'know ? " <p> " Maybe you want something else now , Owen . " <p> " I 'm not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want something else . " <p> He 's fencing with me , challenging me to lay a recovery spiel on him , so he can turn sulky and defiant . I do n't want to play that game . We sit side by side on the porch swing , pushing off lightly with our feet , listening to the creak of the swing chain . We do n't talk , and it feels good . For months I 've been talking , pumping the poison up out of my soul ; I 've been listening to people talk about their own struggles , as a way of finding a key to my own . But sometimes you need someone you do n't have to talk to . <p> At the 7-Eleven , Owen hangs on my arm while I read the labels on condoms . " Nyet , " he whispers as he tongues my ear . " I want my bare dick inside you . You should take the pill . " <p> " Grow up , Owen . People are dying . " <p> He sighs . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't like the old days . " <p> November <p> Owen likes to walk through the rooms of his house naked . He likes stepping barefoot from plank floor to terry-cloth rug , and he likes the feel of air-conditioning on his body . Some nights he works naked in the shop : not when he 's cutting molds on the band saw , or curing hides , but sometimes when he 's shaping the heads , packing the ears and nostrils with clay , airbrushing a trout with rainbow colors . He has a big , flat table he keeps sanded smooth as my inner thigh , and a walk-in freezer , with the fish he 's working with stacked on one side and his food stored on the other . He buys glass eyes by the barrel . <p> " Look at this . " He 's working on a bearskin rug . " They cut the throat to drain the blood , thinking they were helping me . Now I 've got to stitch it , and it 's going to look like shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sure , in Alaska . " I check his eye but there 's no gleam ; this is a true story . " You can salvage about three-fourths of a bear , and the meat is sweet and greasy . After a while even the dogs wo n't eat it . " <p> Up in the loft , stacked behind other old junk , are the last canvases he started before he quit painting . He studied at art schools , and exhibited in galleries . The Ancient Days , he calls them . But then somehow he lost that , and he has n't painted since before I knew him . " Come down from there . " <p> " You should finish this , " I say , staring at a half-done portrait of a nude woman . Her head is thrown back in ecstasy , her throat flushed . A layer of dust darkens the colors . <p> Later , in his big claw-footed tub , Owen 's hand-feathers the edge of a barber 's razor along my thigh , carefully scraping away the hair-flecked lather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me shudder . He dots a finger to the nicks and raises it to my lips . The blood tastes sweet . Owen smiles . But he does n't like this game ; it 's mine . I put one finger in the blood , then to his lips , but he does n't want it . " What were we like , Randi  --  in the old days ? " <p> " You were crazy . I was a drunken whore . " <p> " And we were in love . " <p> " You 're talking about sex , Owen . Not love . " <p> " Same thing . " <p> " Tell me about love . " <p> " Love is a blind worm that lives inside you . " He eyes the razor , turns it through slow angles . Light walks along the blade . " When it feeds , it thrashes in its excitement , and it gnaws at your guts , makes them open and bleed . " <p> " And if you do n't feed it ? " He shrugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my mouth on his shoulder . " Love is n't pain , my love . " <p> " Love is pain . " <p> The next time I get on top . His hands rub my ass as I bear down . <p> He 's different from most guys ; they let you on top but it makes them nervous . Owen likes to be the woman . I do n't mean like a fag . Just that he likes to lie there , and be fucked . <p> December <p> I have n't been home in three days . After work it 's closer to go to Owen 's , and after Owen it 's easier to stay the night . I keep some clothes there , and my makeup and blow dryer and things I keep in a carry-on in my car . Owen 's been staying home , staying out of trouble ; we make love and cook food and watch the million channels on his giant TV . We do n't use the L-word , but when he comes in me , he whispers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bottom more tightly and murmur , " I want to stay with you . " In the night , his mouth on my stomach wakes me . He takes up a flashlight and examines my body with it inch by inch , ending with the pearl of blood that is my clitoris . <p> " Oh baby , " I whisper . " O my detective . " <p> March <p> " We should go to the new club Gary told me about . The Locker Room . " <p> " It 's a strip bar . " <p> " Is it ? " <p> " You 're so full of shit , Owen . " He takes a slug of beer . We 've started getting wasted together again , but we only drink beer : our fantasy of control . <p> " Hell , Randi , we 're so straight nowadays . A little excitement never hurt nobody . " <p> " So go . But I do n't want to hear about it . " <p> We watch TV a while , flipping channels . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? There might be somebody working there we used to know . We could hang around with her . " <p> " Who is she , Owen ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . But I catch what he 's trying to hide , that bit of a smile . <p> " Okay , Owen . Tell me what the game is . " <p> " I do n't know . . . " <p> " Yes you do know , Owen , goddamn you ! You do know ! " <p> Without any warning at all I 'm shaking with rage . I dump the popcorn over his head . The metal bowl clangs on the floor . Then the lamp , the phone , bottles , anything within reach . But then I stop . It 's no good . Owen is grinning . <p> " Shit , girl , " he says . " You going to spit on the floor now ? " <p> " Just tell me the truth , Owen . Do you want to be with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my life . " <p> " That 's not what I want . " He 's starting to cry now . Tears flow from his unblinking eyes . " I try to tell you things . I just get scared . " He takes a breath deep enough to make him tremble . " If you know what I 'm like  --  what I 'm thinking  --  then you wo n't want me around . " <p> " Oh , Owen . " <p> So then we go . You 're going to say I knew better . And yeah , I did know . But I was n't ready to see it . I had n't hurt enough yet . <p> Lights . Music . Action . The barkeep calls out the girl 's pseudonym , then starts a CD at deafening volume . I order O. J. Owen gets mad that I wo n't drink with him , then forgets it , as one girl after another slowly strips off her sequins and spreads herself open before his eyes . After his second beer , he switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dance , each girl comes around in her panties , holding a carafe for tips . Some guys look away . For the ones who dig deep , she sits beside them on the bar stool , laughing at their jokes , letting them touch her throat and thighs . There are booths in the back for private shows ; the girl is nude and nobody asks what happens . Guys hand over their credit cards and go back there , then come out three songs later buckling their belts and grinning , while their buddies halloo and pound them on the back . Lap dancing is ten bucks , and the girls smile like robots through their makeup as they writhe and push against the lumps in the men 's jeans . The men touch them all over , but are supposed to stay out of their pants ; it 's the law . But one guy gets hold of a girls ' throat and bends her back against the bar , then very deliberately pulls her panties down her hips . Two bouncers start toward him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drunken concentration , staring down at his own hand as he pushes it around inside her . I can see it all too clearly : his fingers rubbing her clitoris , pressing into and out of her vagina . Her head is bowed back against the cold wood of the bar , and her eyes glisten with tears . <p> Then I see Owen 's face . His eyes are locked on her eyes . I 've never seen a look quite like that . <p> Desire . <p> Rapture . <p> The bouncers break it up . The manager pats the girl on the shoulder , and I hear him telling her to get dressed for her next dance . <p> " I 'm outta here , " I say . " Stay here . " <p> Owen grabs my arm ; I try to shake it off , but he 's too strong . <p> " Cut it out , " he says . " You ca n't go out there alone . Some creep 'll rape you . " <p> " Those girls are getting raped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He trails me out to the parking lot , and grabs me before I can get in my car . He shoves his face into mine and yells , but I ca n't make out the words . His breath stinks . I spit on the ground . Then the security comes up behind us and says up-against-the-wall . Owen wants to swing on him , but he 's not too wasted to assess the piece in the man 's hand . The guard pats him down , then suddenly knees him in the kidneys . Owen goes down , his cigarette sparkling along the gravel . <p> " It 's okay , " I say . " Leave him alone . " He slips a fold of bills into his shirt pocket , then tosses the wallet at Owen 's feet . " You two get off the property . " <p> " Give him back his money ! " <p> " You 're drunk , sister . I do n't know what you 're talking about . " <p> I get Owen to the car . He leans over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel . <p> For years alcohol was good to me , and then for years more it was pain in a bottle . All through both those lifetimes , it had a glamor I could n't resist , a sparkle more ruthless and keen than any gem . Now it 's none of those things ; it 's just this waste , this shame , this man with an empty wallet vomiting on dirty gravel . Now it 's boring . At Denny 's , we fall in with a companionable table of drunks . We all order lots of food and then put our cigarettes out in it . Somebody has cards and Owen does tricks with them , pulling four jacks off a burning house . Owen makes up a story about the bruises on his face . The girls like him , but their dates are uneasy . <p> " You want to go , then ? " I say to Owen . He fixes his crooked eye on me . <p> The fourth time we have sex I black out , just for a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays inside me so long , makes me come so many times . I 'm used to him making love to me all night with his hands and tongue . But he 's never fucked me this much before . <p> I know why . <p> " You do n't want me , " I say when he wakes me up for another round . " You want that girl . " <p> " Come on , baby . " He 's as hard as the first time . His fingers are inside me , nibbling my favorite spots , but I 'm turning to ice inside . The mind is its own body . I do n't want him . <p> " Can you see me , Owen ? " I shove my face against his . " Who am I ? Who do you see ? Besides , we ca n't . We do n't have any more condoms . " <p> He reaches for his pants . " The all-night store . . . " <p> " No , " I say . " Do n't leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just hold me . " <p> His hand cradles my stomach , and we sleep together like spoons . But in the night I feel him pressing against me again . <p> " No , Owen . Dammit . " <p> " Just let me . . . " Owen 's never rough with me  --  but suddenly he is . He wedges my hips against the mattress , grinds my face into the pillow . I try to yell but my mouth is fouled with lace . He ignores my nails digging into his shoulders , so I use my fists , but they feel like nothing , like air , against his hard muscles . I raise my right foot , take a breath , and kick him hard in the side of the head . <p> It 's a mistake . I can see his face in the moonlight , and it 's not the face of anyone I know . His lips snarl , and his fists and elbows come down on me , over and over . Finally I just let him do it , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want him , but the motion makes me wet , and his dick is bigger than it ever gets ; I can feel it touching a spot down in there that he never reaches . When he comes I push my hips down , but part of the slime goes in . <p> He rolls away , starts snoring . I dry my tears , try to wipe away what he put inside me . The toilet paper sticks to me , and my hands are shaking so I ca n't get it right . <p> At home , I stand under the shower for two hours , trying to wash him off me . I ca n't . The bruises on my ribs and hips are big as saucers , and my swollen eyes are turning purple . I load my gun , and keep it in my hand as I pour all the beer down the sink and fling the bottles into the trash . Then I call Mary from AA . She says she 'll come right over . <p> April <p> " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . " <p> " Will you just see me ? " <p> " Stay away from me , Owen . " <p> " Just tell me what the game is . " <p> " Here 's the game : If you come around here , I 'll kill you . " <p> June <p> Each day I get stronger . Each night I 'm able to go to sleep easier , think about Owen a little less . I even go out on a date once , but when he calls me again I tell him no , I 'm not ready . Then one day a call comes from Darleen at the sherrif 's office , telling me I should come and get my stuff . <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " Well , Owen broke the lease , y'know . . . He left all his stuff , and it 'll end up sold at auction . There 's a trunk in the living room with your name on it . Figured you 'd want it . " <p> " Owen left town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . I heard he went out to California , just threw some stuff in his truck and hit the road . Told people he was going to live in the woods and get sober . " <p> " I wish I could believe that . But you know Owen . He 's such a liar . " <p> " You never know . " <p> After work I 'm going to drive out there , but halfway to his place I get scared and go back home . But then I ca n't sleep , and around two in the morning I go back . The power 's off , but I shine a flashlight around and find the key under the brick . All his furniture is there , and his video gear and tapes and books . It looks like he left everything but his clothes and tools . The trunk is in the bedroom . There 's some clothes I left here  --  sex clothes , mostly , the kind I do n't wear anymore  --  and kitchen things like a sandwich maker . <p> So then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black room : and my heart stops . <p> Head of a goat , but the body is a collie dog . The stubby horns gleam , and the blunt , black claws . For a second , terror grips me , as I half expect it to move . But of course it stays still ; it 's no space mutant , just something Owen has made , using his skill to fasten one animal part to another . Very slowly I walk about the room , looking at them all , at this museum of freaks he 's made . There 's a racoon 's face in an owl 's skull , and a young gator with a cat 's head and shoulders . Sleek black fur bristles where it overlaps mottled yellow-green scales . <p> He 's arranged them carefully , some crouching behind a table , others raising their claws . Track lights are positioned to light them , so I throw the main breaker and switch them on . In the sculpture of light and shadow , they loom like mythological creatures : centaurs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place goes to the feathered serpent : eagle head and torso trailing the heavy grace of a diamondback rattler . Beside it , stuck in the plank wall with a switchblade knife , is a piece of paper . <p> Randi , <p> Has he gone crazy again , or regained his Art ? Who knows ? These images of resurrection , I make in your honor . It 's been a lot of years since I tried to live like a human being , tried to do more good than harm . I think it 's time I tried again . <p> Be of good cheer , Randi , and know how I 'm thinking of you , how I miss you , how much I 'll always love you . There 's a chance that some night years from now , in your cozy house somewhere , you 'll open your door and let me in . I 'll bring in my bags , and you 'll make me a bed on the couch , and we 'll brew hot tea . We 'll take off our shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades to gray . <p> And we 'll hold hands like we used to  --  but it wo n't be the way it used to . It 'll be the way it should have been . <p> Love Always , Owen Reading the note again , I notice its literary side , its edge of play . It 's just more Owen-theater , maybe , just another story . But it 's a better , cleaner story . I hope he keeps telling it to himself . I read it one more time , then sit down and begin looking at the animals , at the strange life Owen has crafted into their faces . The goat-dog looks menacing , the bird-snake bold and sly . The owl-racoon looks troubled but like he 's trying . <p> How long I sit and study them , I do n't know . But when I look up , night is rubbing at the windows , and the dust in the beams of the track lights is a swarm of golden bees . I realize that he 's gone . I look inside myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be of good cheer , Owen , and make a life for yourself . I do n't expect to see you again in this one . But I can see you now in my mind 's eye , somewhere west of here , driving with your arm hung out the window and the ball of your right foot warm on the gas pedal . You top another hill , start down into a long valley . The day is clear and you can see everything before you . <p> <p> By G. Travis Regier <p>
