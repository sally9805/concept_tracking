<p> Alarmists claim man-made chemicals called " endocrine disrupters " are causing widespread birth defects and lower sperm counts . Now an authoritative report shows those warnings to be mostly hype . But do n't tell that to politicians or the press . <p> The hit film The Blair Witch Project took eight days to film , had three actors , cost $35,000 , and did exactly what it was supposed to : make a box-office fortune while scaring the pants off viewers . <p> Contrast that with the new report by the nation 's most respected body of health science researchers , the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) , on what is probably the most volatile and terrifying environmental issue of our day : chemicals that can harm the body 's hormonal system . It took four years to prepare , had 16 panelists , cost $1 million , and yet too often came to conclusions resembling a Rorschach blot . That 's a shame , because it was the best opportunity to counter a movement that would have us spend hundreds of billions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals and the products they produce , including 95 percent of all U.S. baby bottles , vital drugs , and medical equipment , and the pesticides that help make our food prices the lowest in the world while keeping other nations ' populations from starving . <p> Nonetheless , the NAS report did contain enough scientific conclusions to box the ears of the endocrine alarmists . Fill in the blanks with the rest of what we 've learned , and you find that this explosive controversy is a dud for any creature able to read these words . THE LITTLE BOOK OF HORRORS <p> " Endocrine disrupters , " or to use the NAS report 's more accurate term , " hormonally active agents " ( HAAs ) , took their place firmly in America 's collective cranial cavity  --  the part that generates fear  --  with the publication of Our Stolen Future in 1996 . World Wildlife Fund zoologist Theo Colborn was chief author ; his co-authors were Boston Globe reporter Dianne Dumanoski , and J.P . Meyers of the environmentalist W. Alton Jones Foundation . The Jones Foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endocrine disrupter thesis , supported both the writing and promotion of the book . <p> In the foreword , Vice President Al Gore calls it the next Silent Spring , referring to Rachel Carson 's 1962 book that kicked off the environmentalist campaign against synthetic chemicals . But while Silent Spring ( and the environmental movement to date ) had focused on cancer , Our Stolen Future was an implicit acknowledgment that the cancer campaign was faltering scientifically and that it was time for a new gig . <p> And what a gig ! According to the book 's subtitle alone , our fertility , intelligence , and even survival are threatened by these HAAs . Virtually any real or possible human or animal health problem may be blamed on these chemicals , including cancer , birth defects , falling sperm counts , lesbian seagulls ( giving rise to the term " gender benders " for HAAs ) , and alligators with shrunken members . <p> Colborn 's warnings are often terrifying . Just a bit too late for Halloween of 1997 she told a convention in San Francisco : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exposed to man-made chemicals that will prevent them from becoming healthy , whole children . " <p> As to what exposes us to these chemicals , the list is as broad as the spectrum of alleged harms . It includes many pesticides , PVC ( vinyl ) and other plastics , plastic softeners like phthalates , pharmaceuticals , pipes , paints , tin cans , car interiors , dental sealants , detergents , and cosmetics . <p> In the past year alone , products containing actual or alleged HAAs have been the focus of major environmentalist group fear fests concerning soft plastic toys , teethers , clear plastic baby bottles , plastic wraps and containers used in cooking , and medical devices such as blood bags and tubing . ABC 's " 20/20 " and the increasingly politicized Consumer Reports have proved invaluable allies in these efforts . <p> Yet aside from perhaps a few dozen chemicals , nobody has any idea of how many man-made HAAs there are , much less whether they can cause problems , or what doses would be required to cause them . Even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their hormonal influence depends on the dose , the type of animal exposed , and other factors . Is a hammer a deadly weapon ? Depending on the circumstances , the answer can be either yes or no . <p> But in the wake of Colborn 's book and a Tulane University study released in the prestigious journal Science three months later that received massive , unquestioning media coverage ( Associated Press : " Study Finds Combined Pesticides Are Incredibly More Dangerous " ) , Congress ordered the EPA to begin testing upwards of 86,000 different chemicals . While it was no doubt sheer coincidence that W. Alton Jones provides heavy funding to the Tulane program , no lab could replicate the study and eventually the researchers had to publish a retraction . But Congress did n't retract its legislation , the media largely ignored the Tulane retraction , and the EPA insisted it wanted to proceed . Nevertheless , the agency has found itself utterly unable to decide on how to do the initial screening , and testing has been delayed indefinitely . EXCRUCIATING EXPENDITURES <p> A widespread effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bans , would be devastating . " Any industry that uses or manufactures synthetic chemicals or depends on them , such as plastics , toy-making , pesticides makers , farmers  --  all of these will feel tremendous impact , " says Endocrine/Estrogen Letter publisher Steve Usdin . " Companies and ultimately consumers will be severely impacted by the campaigns and publicity alone , regardless of any ultimate scientific consensus . " <p> Nobody can put a price tag on all this . But according to a 1993 industry-sponsored study , removing just one class of chemicals that many environmentalists have branded endocrine disrupters ( organochlorines ) could cost the country $100 billion a year . Removing just one product singled out by environmentalists ( bisphenol A ) could soon approach $2 billion yearly . Some of these chemicals could be replaced at great expense ; many could not currently be replaced at any cost . WANTED : NEW WAYS TO DEMONIZE MAN-MADE CHEMICALS <p> Why the sudden onslaught on HAAs ? It reflects not so much a change in natural science as in political science . After more than two decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcinogen has fallen out of repute , not just with scientists but with the public . <p> Increasingly people have come to understand that while synthetic chemicals cause cancer in massive-dose rodent tests about half the time , the percentage is similar with natural chemicals . Furthermore , solid evidence has emerged that rodents are n't simply tiny versions of human beings . Berkeley biologists Lois Gold and Bruce Ames have shown that , a third of the time , substances causing cancer in rats do n't do so in mice , and vice-versa . ( See my article " The Politics of Cancer Testing , " TAS , August 1990 . ) By 1994 , only a fourth of the members of the American Association for Cancer Research believed that human cancer risks can be assessed by the massive-dose testing of rodents . Environmentalists continue to refer to these rodent carcinogens as simply carcinogens , with the clear message that they also cause cancer in humans . But more and more , the public is either suffering cancer-scare fatigue , or simply recognizing the unlikelihood that half of all man-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the cancer panic were National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) reports , heavily covered by the media , that cancer rates in the U.S. , when adjusted for the aging of the population , peaked in 1990 . " When the NCI finally said cancer cases are down and so are cancer deaths , " says Michael Gough , a scientist with the Competitive Enterprise Institute , " they had to find something . " Our Stolen Future gave them that something . ALLIGATOR ANGST AND WILDLIFE WOES <p> Let 's start with wildlife . You may believe that whatever two seagulls do in the privacy of their bedroom is their own business . But withered willies ? Now that sounds serious . University of Florida zoologist Louis Guillette insists that this could not only result in lower reproductive rates among alligators and other animals but could also portend problems for humans . Guillette 's alligators are repeatedly referred to as " sentinels " for human health , the proverbial " canary in the coal mine , " albeit with big teeth and bulging eyes . His work is reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Hormone Hell . " Many writers , such as the one who penned " Children at Risk , " readily extrapolate from gators to guys . <p> But it may be Guillette 's claims that have the real shortcomings . <p> First , Lake Apopka , where Guillette 's test subjects were found , is one of the most heavily polluted lakes in Florida , a former dumping ground for a vast variety of chemicals , some of which are believed to be HAAs and others of which are not . It is perhaps the main tenet of toxicology that " the dose makes the poison " and that enough exposure to anything will hurt you , but conversely , at a low enough level it will prove harmless . Further , even those who 've never gotten closer to an alligator than watching " Mutual of Omaha 's Wild Kingdom " are aware of major differences between that animal 's physiology and ours , such as the brownish-green color , cold blood , tail , four legs , and long snout . Moreover , despite myriad articles written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " their members are actually called " phalluses , " since they are n't used for urination . <p> The reader may be wondering , " How do you go about measuring a gator 's phallus ? " Wildlife endocrinologist Timothy Gross , a colleague of Guillette 's at the University of Florida who took part in some of Guillette 's testing , told me that when they first began their phallic studies , as a safety precaution Guillette and his colleagues only grabbed the smaller gators . The problem is , smaller gators are immature , and may not have fully grown phalluses . So this " completely messed up the data set , " says Gross . <p> Believe it or not , there is no way other than looking at the genitals to determine what sex a gator is . According to Gross , what Guillette calls undersized phalluses may have been oversized clitorises . There 's just no way of telling . <p> Guillette 's conclusions were based on such shoddy evidence , Gross says , that Gross insisted his name not be put on the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they did n't put in caveats , " he notes . " It does n't mean it does n't occur , it just means we do n't know for sure . " <p> " Have you told this to any other reporters ? " I asked Gross . <p> " Oh sure , " he said . " At least 50 . " But none bothered to relay it to their readers . <p> One writer who interviewed Gross for her book and then sliced out his comments was Colborn herself . She also insisted upon labeling alligator organs " penises . " For a zoologist , that 's no mere mistake ; when your objective is to make animals appear as surrogates for humans , you draw just as little attention to the distinctions as possible . <p> Poking holes in penile propaganda does n't get HAAs off the hook for disturbing wildlife . " I think it 's very clear that endocrine-active chemicals are indeed affecting wildlife , " Gross says , naming fish , freshwater turtles , and less-spectacular alligator problems as examples . The NAS report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently have a rudimentary physiology , eat the same contaminated food every day , and often have a lifelong exposure to a single polluted area . <p> Guillette inadvertently made this point when he told a Florida newspaper , " The alligator makes a beautiful model . It does n't get up and fly away . It does n't move to another country for part of its life cycle , " he said . " They 're going to stay their whole lives within a mile-and-a-half of where they were born . " But that makes the alligator " a beautiful model " for what ? How many humans have ever , at any point in history , obtained all their food and drink from within a 1.5-mile radius of their birthplace ? <p> " Today you and I go out and eat beef from God knows where , chicken that is uniform , and fruits , vegetables , and grains from all over the world , " points out Gross . <p> " I 've never questioned there 's a problem with wildlife , " says Dr. Stephen Safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'll also say that a lot of really contaminated systems are making a comeback . For example , the Great Lakes are really improving . " Further , he flatly rejects claims that a " boy is an alligator is a seagull . " " If you get an interesting result in a turtle egg or water flea , " says Safe , " some people will say ' There but for the grace of God go I. ' But there 's no evidence that any of those compounds , that some groups tout as being horrible endocrine problems for the environment , cause anything in humans . " DESPERATELY SEEKING SPERMATOZOA <p> Perhaps the most spectacular claim in Our Stolen Future is the one alluded to in the title . No sperm , no future . It provided fodder for articles around the world with titles like the New Yorker 's " Silent Sperm , " Esquire 's " Downward Motility , " and Mother Jones 's " Down for the Count . " Time magazine 's science writer declared , " In study after study , sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitously . " Even before Our Stolen Future 's publication , Greenpeace had popularized the slogan , " You 're half the man your grandfather was . " <p> Colborn focused on the work of Danish scientist Niels Skakkebaek and British researcher Richard Sharpe , who indeed reported they 'd found a sharp decline in human sperm production . But they also found this had leveled off in 1970 , hardly support for a theory blaming a gradual buildup of chemicals for causing the problem . Skakkebaek himself has said , " It is premature to call for a ban on these or any other chemicals before more research is done . They environmentalists are misrepresenting this research . " <p> Again , somehow there just was n't space for this comment in Our Stolen Future . Nor did virtually any media outlet report that shortly after Colborn 's book hit the stores , three different studies in the journal Fertility and Sterility indicated there was no decline in sperm counts . <p> The NAS report concluded , " No analysis to date can prove or disprove a uniform global trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decline over time were comparing different regions where data was taken at different times . As such , said the NAS , " one can not assume an environmental cause for the variability observed in human populations . " <p> This is all the more powerful considering that sitting on the NAS panel was probably the world 's top sperm-decline devotee , Shanna Swan of the University of Missouri-Columbia . In late 1997 , Swan and two colleagues published a paper essentially claiming that today 's males are a third of the men their grandfathers were . They said the evidence was clear that sperm counts were rapidly dropping in the U.S. , and faster yet in Europe . The media trumpeted Swan 's findings . " Sperm Counts Continue to Plunge , " exclaimed the Calgary Herald . " Studies Point to a Fearsome Chemical Risk , " cried the Toronto Star . It seemed just a matter of time before our sperm counts would fall below zero . <p> Conversely , reporters generally ignore one of the leading American fertility specialists , Dr. Harry Fisch , director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Like the earlier sensationalist sperm studies , " The differences in Swan 's findings represent geographic differences rather than data over time , " he explains . " Before 1970 nearly all the studies were from the New York region , which has higher sperm counts , " while the later data represent areas of the country that for whatever reason have lower sperm counts . " Just take out New York City from the analysis and there 's no decline . " <p> As to Swan 's European findings , he notes : " If you evaluate the European data against previous European data , there actually appears to be a slight increase . " Instead , she compared Europe to the U. S. Further , says Fisch , " If she had included data published after 1990  --  even using her own statistical methodology she would have found no decline . " Fisch says the report should have flatly ruled out a sperm count decline , much less one caused by HAAs . D.E.S . DENIAL <p> The panel was firmer concerning cancer of the breast or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Colborn discussed it on 27 pages , the NAS found that despite a massive number of studies involving the usual suspects , such as the insecticide DDT and the electrical insulator chemical PCBs , there was no evidence linking these to cancer of the breast or prostate ( another cancer commonly associated with synthetic HAAs ) , or indeed any type of cancer . <p> It also does n't help Colborn 's case that while she devoted seven pages to the alleged increase in U.S. breast cancer cases , NCI data released later on showed that , as with cancer cases as a whole , those of the breast had stopped increasing around 1990 . <p> On the other hand , the NAS report 's section on human fetal abnormalities seems to range from ambiguous to alarming . To be so , it essentially had to ignore the data on Diethylstilbesterol ( DES ) , which 4 million to 5 million women took from the late 1930 's to early 1970 's in hope of preventing miscarriages . Sadly , while it did n't prevent miscarriages , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many decades , by so many women , and at such high levels , and has been studied so thoroughly , it makes the ideal chemical with which to gauge not only what birth defects an HAA can cause , but what it might do directly to the user . <p> Yet DES received three whole sentences of discussion in a 48-page chapter , plus a bunch of tables stuck on as an appendix . " I was shocked , " says Robert Golden , a Potomac , Maryland toxicologist and DES expert . " There is an enormous body of data on bad things DES did and the report practically ignored it , particularly as to how this human data could have been used to help judge if HAAs from the environment might be a problem . " <p> Even the DES appendix to Colborn 's book omits all information about dosage levels . Yet understanding the dose levels and their results , says Golden , could tell us more about how HAAs affect humans than any other body of evidence . <p> " With DES , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason the lowest doses were prescribed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , New York and the highest at the University of Chicago . When you look at Mayo results , there 's nothing coming out of there . Yet out of the University of Chicago , there are all sorts of reproductive problems such as small penises , decreased sperm , abnormal sperm . " ( There was , however , no decreased fertility even among those with these defects . ) <p> This information , omitted from the NAS report , shows that to have the same risk of birth defects as from DDT  --  the known HAA vilified by Rachel Carson  --  a woman would have to consume over a pound of DES during her pregnancy . <p> Further , said Golden , " They also missed a whole body of literature on women who conceived while on powerfully estrogenic birth control pills they kept taking until they realized they were pregnant . Those children had no defects . " NO PLETHORA OF PLANT PANIC <p> The NAS report also gives little attention to the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wheat , potatoes , oats , rye , rice , barley , apples , and cherries . Over 300 plants have been discovered to contain HAAs , thereby " dosing " us at rates vastly higher than anything man-made . According to NAS panel member Safe , the overall hormonal effect of natural chemicals is 40 million times that of man-made ones . For instance , a clever clover in Australia sterilizes its bitter enemy , the sheep , by literally reshaping the ewe 's sex organs . And throughout history women have successfully used various plants , such as the pomegranate in ancient Greece , as contraceptives . <p> Environmentalists , including the writers of Our Stolen Future , acknowledge that plant HAAs can cause harm . But Colborn downplays the effects , in part by noting that " humans have adapted over millions of years to HAAs in many food plants . " <p> Problem : These plants usually are n't the ones we most commonly eat today . Soybeans , for example , contain significant levels of two estrogen-like chemicals , including that which sterilized so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American diet until after World War II . Today they 're the source of our most common food oil , of which the average American consumes about 49 pounds each year . So much for adaptation . Yet despite or even because of soy 's powerful hormonal activity it appears to be healthy for us in many ways . AVOIDING FINAL CONCLUSIONS <p> Jim Lamb , a member of the NAS panel and a toxicologist with the environmental consulting firm of Blasland , Bouck , and Lee in Reston , Virginia , acknowledges the report 's repeated hedging , data omissions , and endless calls for more research , but calls it encouraging overall . " You never see an NAS report that does n't call for more research , " he says . " You do see NAS reports that call for testing and regulatory action , and this does n't . That really means something . " <p> But readers or even reporters can hardly be expected to know that . They are more likely to have read Theo Colborn 's crafty comment to the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panel 's findings , thereby implying that the report supported her book 's position . <p> Sadly , this is the trend for scientific studies in general , especially those concerning health scares , which seem to hibernate but never die . The result is needlessly prolonged fear and the waste of precious funds and researchers . All this reinforces the " precautionary " principle of " Ban anything until it 's proven safe . " <p> The NAS had the chance to strike against sophistry and panic . What it produced was better than nothing . Yet in its effort to satisfy all the panelists , it dealt human hormone hysteria merely a bruising roundhouse . Given the available science , it should have delivered a death blow . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> By Michael Fumento <p> <p> Michael Fumento is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and author most recently of The Fat of the Land : Our Health Crisis and How Overweight Americans Can Help Themselves ( Penguin ) <p> <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
