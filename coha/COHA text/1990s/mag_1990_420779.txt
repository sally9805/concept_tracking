Section : IN THE GREENHOUSE <p> WE SELDOM APPRECIATE the value of a greenhouse alarm system until the heater fails on some cold winter night and the temperature falls so low that it threatens to kill our precious plants . For a small investment of time and money , you can avoid the trauma that a failed-heater or other emergency can cause . <p> A greenhouse alarm can be as simple as a battery-operated doorbell connected to a thermostat . Should the temperature in the greenhouse fall below the setting on the thermostat , the bell is activated . Fancier alarm systems are available that employ additional sensors that respond to humidity , smoke , snow , rising water levels , and even burglars . <p> No matter how complex a system you choose , it will consist of four basic components : a sensor , a power supply , a warning device , and the electrical wire that connects them . When buying a greenhouse alarm system , look carefully at its components to be sure they will suit your needs . <p> Sensors are available from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that a switch closes and activates a warning device when an emergency condition occurs . Two low-cost temperature sensors are Thermalarm and Temp Alert , both of which cost $35 . Temperature sensors should be positioned at plant height and adjusted to activate the alarm system when the temperature reaches a predetermined high or low setting . <p> The power supply for an alarm system should not be dependent on an electric source that could be interrupted during a storm . Most alarm systems are powered by 6- to 24-volt flashlight or lantern batteries . Some systems contain a 1 15-volt battery charger to keep the battery charged continuously . Some also have a voltmeter attached that tells you what condition the battery currently in . <p> The warning device must be one that gets your attention and rouses you to take action . Bells , horns , or buzzers located in the house where they can be heard day or night are especially effective . Some alarm systems employ flashing lights , useful for those who are hard of hearing . Whatever warning device you choose , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the greenhouse located far from the house , an automatic telephone dialer may be the best warning device , one called Sensaphone automatically dials up to four preprogrammed telephone numbers and delivers a message . It then switches to a built-in microphone to allow you to hear any unusual sounds in the greenhouse . If you are visiting friends for the evening , you can program it to dial that number should an emergency arise . The basic unit costs $200 . <p> Plastic-coated , 16- to 20-gauge bell wire is commonly used for hooking up greenhouse alarms ( but not the telephone alarm systems ) . The greater the distance between sensor and alarm , the heavier the wire should be . Check with an electrician if you are in doubt . Be careful to situate the wires so that they can not be accidentally disconnected . It may be necessary to bury wire that runs outdoors . <p> If you are handy with tools , it is easy to install a basic alarm system . The instructions that come with the unit are usually clearly explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It does n't make sense to install an alarm system if you are not prepared to cope with an emergency should one occur . If you want to prevent plants in the greenhouse from freezing in the event of loss of heat , set the alarm to go off at about 40 degrees Fahrenheit . This is below the normal greenhouse operating temperature but high enough to give you time to deal with the emergency before the temperature drops to 32 degrees . When the alarm goes off , you can start a backup kerosene heater , cover plants with insulation , or move the plants into your home . You could also set your system to activate the alarm when temperatures get too high . In that case , open the doors and vents , then wet down the floor and benches to cool the area through evaporation . <p> It is a good idea to check your alarm system weekly . Some units have a switch that simulates an alarm condition , others require that the sensor be activated by simulating an emergency . Sensors such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to remove dust and dirt . <p> If you do n't already have an alarm system in your greenhouse , installing one should be a top priority . It will allow you to sleep peacefully at night knowing that your plants are truly secure . <p> For sources of materials mentioned in this article , see page 66 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : In a cold like this we should appreciate the value of a greenhouse alarm system . <p> By John W. Bartok , Jr . <p> <p> John W. Bartok , Jr. , wrote about bench and bed construction in his November 1990 " In the Greenhouse " column . <p>                     @x Brazil , one of the four so-called BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) has around 190 million inhabitants , tens of millions of them coming out of poverty in the six years since Luiz Incio Lula da Silva was elected president . Under Lula 's leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 billion , inflation is below this year 's 6.5 percent target , and unemployment is at its lowest in ten years , with the September 2008 jobless rate at 7.6 percent compared to 9 percent in September 2007 . Per capita GDP is now around $10,000 and growing . " Brazil is still standing , because we did what had to be done , " Lula said recently . <p> In the first semester of 2008 , the top 340 companies in the BM &F; Bovespa reported a profit of $30 billion ; over 80 percent of publicly traded firms in Brazil are making money , with 2007 profits up an average 10 percent . Last year , GDP growth came to 5.3 percent , and although that kind of performance wo n't be repeated in 2008 due to the global economic situation , economists still expect Brazil to close the year with at least 4 percent growth . <p> " The great advantage of Brazil having adopted a conservative fiscal and financial policy is that we have enough resources and stability to face a crisis that is affecting everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Bank . Brazilian banks are solid and profitable , thanks to the stability created by Lula 's predecessor , Fernando Henrique Cardoso . From May 1993 to April 1994 , FHC ( as he 's known ) was Brazil 's finance minister ; as such , he introduced the Real Plan to end hyperinflation . Buoyed by the success of his plan , he was elected president in 1994 and reelected four years later . Cardoso was succeeded in 2003 by Lula , who has also been reelected ; Lula 's current term will expire in 2011 . <p> Dilma Rousseff , an economist and politician from Lula 's ruling Workers ' Party ( PT ) , has been Lula 's chief of staff since 2005 . " We are a stable country not because we have an apathetic population , but because so many people , who were excluded for centuries , are now incorporated into the national economy , " said Rousseff . " We 've managed to expand the middle class by twenty million and remove ten million people from poverty . So political stability in Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our population into the economic gains of growth . And among the BRICs , we have a quite diversified infrastructure . " <p> One of Brazil 's biggest industrial giants is Vale ( formerly Companhia Vale do Rio Doce , or CVRD ) , a mining conglomerate in a country where iron ore is among the top export commodities . CVRD 's privatization in 1997 brought the Brazilian government $3.3 billion in revenue . " The state-owned companies that were privatized were very badly managed , " said Eliezer Batista , CVRD 's former CEO , though he cautioned that " privatization is not a magical key ; it is one of the factors that let you increase productivity . " <p> Meanwhile , Brazil 's growth in technology has been nothing short of explosive . Sales of personal computers jumped more than 120 percent between 2002 and 2007 ; some 29 million PCs are now in use throughout Brazil , with more PCs sold in the past two years than TV sets . <p> Internet use has skyrocketed as well , with 53 million Brazilians online today , or 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number of broadband Internet users reached 10 million by mid-2008 . Likewise , Brazil now has 133 million mobile phones in service , translating into a penetration exceeding 70 percent . <p> The focal point of the Lula government 's Economic Growth Acceleration Plan ( PAC ) is actually a policy of logistics , energy , and social and urban infrastructure . To that end , enormous investments are being made to upgrade roads , airports , and other transportation links . One of the most ambitious projects involves launching a high-speed railway linking Rio de Janeiro , So Paulo , and Campinas . <p> The Lula government will also spend $500 million to upgrade a shipping port in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , as part of its program to dredge eighteen ports around the country and keep Brazil competitive for the shipping of cargo . <p> Another focus of the current government is its massive effort to develop renewable biofuels in the face of highly volatile global oil prices " I do n't think any Brazilian government has given such importance to ethanol as Lula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board of directors of oil giant Petrobrs . " Even though we have much more petroleum than ever before " <p> " Brazil is still standing because we did what had to he done " <p> President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva <p> " The great advantage of Brazil having adopted a conservative fiscal and financial policy is that we have enough resources and stability to face a crisis that is affecting everyone " <p> Henrique Meirelles <p> President of the Central Bank of Brazil <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Brazil 's mighty oil production capacity will help President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stand strong President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Henrique Meirelles <p>
