Try your hand at growing a tasty part of history . // Talk to Chip Hope for just a minute and you 'll probably end up talking tomatoes . " In the South , everybody just loves tomatoes , " Chip says . An instructor at Blue Ridge Community College in Flat Rock , North Carolina , Chip has been growing tomatoes for as long as he can remember . His fascination with heirloom selections has blossomed over the past few years . " Growing heirloom tomatoes makes sense for so many reasons , " he says . " We 're preserving part of our heritage and history . But even more importantly , we 're preserving our genetic plant base . Hybrid tomatoes may be pretty , but without heirlooms , the genetics will vanish . " An heirloom tomato is an openpollinated selection that has been around for at least 50 years . ( See " Tomato Terms " on page 77 . ) Many selections can be purchased through seed catalogs . The catalogs make the old-timey seeds readily available , and the fruit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call family heirlooms , " Chip says . " These have been passed down from generation to generation . " Photograph // Sharing heirloom seeds is part of the fun . They can be collected from the tomatoes , and the fruit will be the same from year to year . " It 's the idea of a sustainable garden , " says Chip . " When it comes to sharing , seeds are rarely given without a story . It 's just part of gardening with heirlooms . " ODD SHAPES GREAT TASTE One of the most appealing things about these tomatoes is their diversity , and fortunately many are now available through mail-order seed catalogs . " Heirlooms are so varied in size , color , and shape . They really are beautiful , " Chip says . " But more than appearance , their flavors are unmatched . They 're a feast for the eyes and the palate when you serve them . " In taste tests he conducts at the college every summer , Brandywine is a consistent winner . When asked about his own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father which child is his favorite . Every year , no every week , I have a favorite in the garden . But it 's hard to beat Brandywine . It always has been one of the best for flavor . " Chip finds that many people share the same goal in growing heirlooms . " The bottom line is , we do it for the tomato sandwiches , " he confesses . " I love Radiator Charlie 's Mortgage Lifter . It is so tasty and huge , one slice covers a piece of bread , " he says . Other favorites demonstrate the range available with heirlooms . Thai Pink was a huge success last summer . With small , plum-shaped fruit that glows iridescent pink , this tomato never quit through the long , hot summer . " It was constantly loaded with tomatoes . The fruit never cracked , and the plants were totally disease resistant . When all the other plants were gone , it was still cranking out tomatoes , " Chip says . " They were tasty as can be in a salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is the Italian drying tomato . There 's no better in the world . We dried them in the dehydrator , sliced in half . They 're okay fresh , but this way they are magnificent . Our family enjoyed them all winter long , " Chip says . Experiment to find the perfect fruit for your taste and use . When you find it , be sure to save a few seeds at the end of the summer . If you come upon a really special one , send some seeds to Chip . He 'll be waiting for your story . " Do I love growing heirlooms ? You bet-I 'm hooked on it , " Chip says .
