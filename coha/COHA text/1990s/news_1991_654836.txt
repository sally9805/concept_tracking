<p> ' THE tree is my master " Antoni Gaudi , the remarkable Barcelona architect , once said . British artist Tim Stead might well echo the thought . <p> Stead works in wood . What he makes does not fit neatly into conventional categories . He notes that in art schools ( at the outset of his career he attended two ) the sculpture departments do not brook furniture-making , any more than furniture-making departments encourage sculpture . He makes both , and it is not always clear - or meant to be - where one begins and the other ends , in his work . <p> At his distinctly rural home and workshop in the Borders Region of Scotland , he shows us a new piece taking shape in the garden . It may be included in a show to be held in 1992 or ' 93 at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh . Still in unfixed parts , the piece gives a glimpse of his working procedures . <p> Clearly it is a seat . That is hardly a surprise : We 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs he and his assistants produce . But standing on each side of this seat are two enormous upright wings of timber , planks sawn out of the same tree , standing like bookends . They widen at the top . Their grain , exposed by the saw cut , is a visual record of the tree 's growth and stature . These two elements take this piece out of the realm of furniture , however unusual , into an image of monumental proportion that can probably best be called " sculpture . " <p> Stead likes the fact that the viewer , approaching such a piece , can step quickly over the question " what is it ? " and then enjoy it unpretentiously . What it does not do is announce itself as a work of art , a kind of self-conscious presentation or isolated monument , demanding a special mind-set in the viewer . It 's a seat . <p> Wood - and at the present it is elm particularly that Stead uses - is the common factor in his multifaceted work . But it is wood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and varnished that it has lost its primitive tree-ness . It remembers the tree : You can still see where the bark was in a rugged contour left unsawn and unplaned . In a bold and organic upright , you are reminded of the tree 's branching and natural curve . Similarly , quarried stone , which is not too squared or polished , can remember its bed . <p> In fact , Stead sees much in common between rock and wood , and when the North Sea Oil Industry in Aberdeen commissioned him to do the wood-work for its Memorial Chapel in the city 's St. Nicholas Kirk , he named the forty identical chairs that are part of this scheme " Strata . " In their backs are incorporated numerous laminated strips of different woods , with different colors . They suggest the geological formation of rocks in which oil is found . <p> THE parallels Stead finds between wood and stone were intriguingly exploited in work he did for the earliest chronological section of a show in Glasgow called " Scotland Creates : 5000 Years of Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what has been described as the best preserved prehistoric village in Northern Europe - at Skara Brae , Orkney . <p> One reason for the preservation of the six houses and one workshop ( dated from 3100-2500 BC ) at Skara Brae is that there were no trees on the island at that time , so everything , including beds and cupboards , were constructed of stone . Stead 's imaginative use of wood to evoke the grain and texture of this ancient stonework demonstrates intriguingly his notion of fraternity between wood and stone . <p> His interest in archaeological remains does , however , predate the commission for this exhibition piece ; in fact it is one of the main springs of his small sculptures carved in burr elm . <p> These natural protuberances on the trunks of trees offer a sculptural block that strongly confronts outer with inner . The rough barky exteriors of these burrs are like mounded , knobbly landscapes in themselves . <p> When Stead carves into them , through the sapwood to harder wood of different color and texture , turning them into enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeological dig into the history , the past life , of the tree . He cuts recesses and compartments inside them , into which are pigeon-holed peculiar carved or sliced forms which seem reminiscent of something , but you are not quite sure what . <p> The contained shapes and forms in these lidded sculptures are like buried artifacts , or nuts secreted in their shells , or bones . When the lid is put back on , Stead enjoys the fact that it is the viewer 's memory and imagination only which can now reveal what the interior forms are like . <p> AT Skara Brae , the ruins of the village had remained invisible below the lumped and grassy windswept landscape until archaeologists went to work on them . Even when the village was inhabited , however , these houses were actually dug into the land . Only their roofs were at all visible . The empathy between these buried , cavern-like houses and Stead 's burr elm sculpture is evident . And Stead is interested in art as living environment . <p> His work as a whole crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sells his furniture to private individuals furnishing their homes . And in spite of the prime- val and even aggressive appearance of these weighty tables and chairs , they are usable as well as being astonishing images . Indeed his massive chairs - though called " Gnasher , " " Corset , " and " Skeletal " - are actually supportively comfortable to sit on . <p> THE somewhat over-the-top character of some of Stead 's furniture , impressively displayed in a Glasgow cafe , the Cafe Gandolfi , which he furnished in 1979 , may be the expression of his ebullient character . The experience of going into his home , where his work seems to take over his living space , is a mix of the surprising , the heart-warming , the funny , and the slightly intimidating . <p> Wood in Stead 's hands evokes such unlikely and diverse associations as backwoods-America , Art Nouveau , and the gothic - not to mention Gaudi . To the more mischievous viewer , it has sometimes suggested Walt Disney or the Flintstones or both . Stead says emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The fact is , though , that this English-born inhabitant of rural Scotland has an exuberant and fantastic richness of imagination which might seem more characteristic of a Mediterranean artist were it not for the tradition of Northern-Grotesque which is his heritage . <p> While Stead objects that Disney 's house-interiors are actually " Tyrolean " folk carving , there still remains something in the rusticity of his work that evokes Disney 's toymaker 's workshop , the hide-out of the seven dwarfs , or at least Tolkien 's hobbits , elves , and gnomes . This at least seems true of Stead 's tables and chairs , for all their macho gigantism . <p> I 'm not sure that such fantastic references are as much of an insult as I imagine he thinks them . Stead 's particular form of baroque exaggeration and relish of a vigorous natural material is an effective counterblast to the effete conceptualism of recent years . Sometimes hyperbole is needed .
