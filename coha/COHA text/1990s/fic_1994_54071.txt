" A Marathon Runner in the Human Race " is a science fiction story set in the milieu of Dave 's new novel , Ambassadors . Two other stories set in that world have already been published : " Reef Apes " in Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine , and " Suicidal Tendencies " in Full Spectrum 4 . <p> AUTUMN LEAVES FLOATED onto the patio . Neil Corbin counted them : three from the maple , six from the ornamental plum . Another shifting of the seasons  --  what did he care ? <p> He keened his ears for the familiar chorus of shuffling shoes or the clicking of Joe and Al 's daily game of dominoes . But not a person stirred , and none were visible save crazy Anne over in the shade of the umbrella table . Were it not for the birdsong in the trees , Neil would have sworn his deafness had never been cured . <p> A car turned into the driveway  --  another source of silence but for the low moan of tires on concrete . The vehicle stopped mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed young man emerged . <p> " Sorry I 'm late , Gramps . Are you ready ? " <p> Nell accepted his grandson 's help in rising . " You 're looking good , " the old man said . <p> " You will , too , Gramps . Come on . The clinic 's expecting you . " <p> Nell removed his elbow from the young man 's grip . " I only move at one speed , Matthew . You know that . " He padded toward the car , wobbling but making steady progress . <p> Matthew rolled his eyes , piled the luggage in the trunk , and went to the driver 's side . <p> " You forgot the trophy , " Neil said . <p> The item lay beside the chair where Neil had been sitting . Grumbling , Matthew retrieved it , placing it in his grandfather 's lap rather than waste time reopening the trunk . <p> Neil 's hands closed over the statuette above the bronze plate that bore his name . His hands automatically stroked the contours of the running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last view of the place that had been his home for so long . His glance tracked to the empty , dusty windows of the far wing . His room had been the third from the end , just over the sign reading " Shadyhome Retirement Community . " <p> The once-immaculate grounds bore the first small signs of neglect . The grape vine he had planted when he came to live there hung lush with fruit in the arbor by the fish pond , its trunk almost as fat as a tree . He 'd never seen so many grapes on it , ripe and ready . His fellow residents always ate them too quickly . <p> " You must be almost the last guy to move out , " Matthew commented . " I think you 'd have stayed there if the place were n't shutting down . " <p> " Could be , " Neil said . He sighed . " Let 's go . " <p> Traffic seemed to part magically in front of them , quiet except for the wind of passage and an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NeWs lack of interest in conversation , kept himself busy manually guiding the car , though the navigation menu prompted him as to what speed to travel , and when to change lanes , in order to maintain the symphony of cross-town transit . <p> Matthew really was looking good . He held the steering wheel with a teenage grace and ease . Neil lifted his own palm , stared at the creases , and after a slight pause , pulled down the visor to look in its tiny mirror . <p> Moles and liver spots disfigured his bald head . The translucent pallor of his complexion was relieved only by the rosette stain of burst capillaries . Wrinkles  --  no , crevasses  --  lined a face rendered gnomelike by passing decades . <p> He lifted up the visor , and turned back to the scenery . He blinked in surprise . They were arriving at their destination . Miles had vanished , lost to the mirror . <p> " Dr. Rosen said to have him paged from the lobby , " Matthew reminded him  --  Neil Hated it when young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want me to go in with you ? " <p> " No . I can manage on my own . " <p> Matthew chuckled . " I 'll pick you up here tomorrow at 10:00 sharp . " <p> " You 'll be late , " Neil said . He hobbled into the clinic as resolutely as his **27;606;TOOLONG legs could carry him . <p> In the morning Matthew was on time , of course , tardiness cured by the deliberate skepticism . The young man was leaning against the car as Neil stepped out the door ahead of Dr. Rosen and strode briskly down the walkway . <p> Matthew 's eyes telescoped outward like a cartoon character . " Gramps ? " he asked . <p> " I 'm not sure , " Neil answered , voice firm and deep . " You tell me . " <p> Matthew grinned and opened the car door . " Looks like they got every molecule in the right place . " He slapped his grandfather on the back , a firm tap that , only a day earlier , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want to get home and see your new room . " <p> " I ca n't wait , " Neil said , deadpan . <p> Neil slid gracefully into his seat , and had his door closed before Matthew could assist . Through the open window poured the aromas of heavy dew and mulch from the flower beds along the walkway . He sucked in a deep breath . When had his nose ever been able to detect scents so well ? <p> Matthew stepped away to speak to Dr. Rosen . They kept their voices so low that Neil knew they were talking about him . Irritated , Neil deliberately turned away . <p> A woman was sitting on a bench about twenty yards in front of the car . The morning sun haloed her reddish curls , giving her oval , smooth features an angelic peace , like a Renaissance madonna , but with northern European coloring . <p> Neil made eye contact . She blushed , and turned her gaze to the avenue , as if expecting someone . <p> Slowly , belatedly , Neil thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and the vehicle pulled away . <p> " You really were a runner , " Matthew said , gesturing at Neil 's body . His jovial tone seemed forced . No doubt his mind was still on whatever Dr. Rosen had told him . <p> The sawdust scent of the track welled up in Neil 's mind . Hurdles skimmed his calves . Competitors hovered in the corner of his eyes , not quite keeping pace with his long , sure leaps and strides . The ribbon parted as his chest struck it . <p> " I broke a track and field record or two . " Neil waved his hand dismissively . " Just school records , you know . I had one good season in sprints and hurdles . " <p> " I thought your event was the marathon . " <p> " That came later . " <p> Neil was jiggling his right leg , and tightening his fists just to gauge their strength . Matthew kept looking at him with a cat-with-a-canary grin . <p> " What 's so funny ? " Neil demanded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're feeling what I felt , two months ago . " <p> Neil pursed his lips . " Maybe , " he said , temporarily closing the subject . <p> Boxes of Neil 's possessions , full of a century 's worth of packrat accumulations , lay stacked willy-nilly all over the guest bedroom of Matthew 's apartment . Neil clicked his tongue , estimated the capacity of the empty shelves , and tried to imagine his collection of photographs and prints against the tobin 's egg blue of the walls . He 'd forgotten the magnitude of moving into a new place . <p> Neil began by shifting aside boxes in order to unroll his treasured Afghan carpet . As he did , his hand skimmed the edge of a flap , slicing his skin open . <p> Wincing , Neil rushed to the bathroom to wash and bandage the paper-cut . With his injured hand over the sink and the other on the faucet handle , he paused . The ribbon of blood along his wrist and forearm reversed its flow , defying gravity to return to the vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice closed , weaving together with an itchiness that made Neil feel as if ants were suturing him up with minuscule needles and thread . <p> Not ants . They were called nanodocs . Within three minutes they had completed their job . Neil ran his finger along unblemished , unscarred flesh . He shuddered . Next thing he knew , the Feynman Institute would come up with a means to revive the dead . <p> Perhaps they had . Lifting his glance to the mirror , he stared at a man from a previous century . The athletic lines of his reflection matched those in the track team photo from his senior year of college . The thick , brown hair was the same glorious mop his June Cleaver mother hounded him to cut , all the while editorializing about the corrupting influence of Those Beatles Fellows . <p> The last time he 'd looked like this , he 'd been twenty-three years old . <p> Even his perspiration evoked an earlier time , when exertion brought out a crisp , pheromonal incense , not the reek of ancient glands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taut and corded  --  no more sagging jowls . He tugged off his shirt , and tapped his firm , lightly rippled abdomen . <p> This was how he 'd been before he 'd developed that annoying tire around his waist . Before he 'd become a father . Before all those years at a desk job . Neil Corbin  --  lean , mean track star . <p> Except he was even better this time around . As requested , the nose he 'd had surgically straightened at age thirty-nine was still straight ; the appendectomy scar , from age seventeen , was gone as if it had never existed . The promise of nanotechnology had blossomed . A year ago , nano-assemblers , despite all their useful applications , could only augment other types of medical care . Now they coursed , self-guided , through every cell of Neil 's body , reining in free radicals , disassembling invasive microbes , healing damage as it occurred . <p> And , of course , restoring youth . Permanently . <p> Neil turned this way and that in the mirror , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric against hard muscle and supple skin . Was this him ? <p> An unfamiliar sensation started low in his torso , grew stronger , and finally demanded attention . He opened his fly and there it was , a physiological event as effortless as breathing or blinking . His groin hummed like a violin string drawn tight over the bridge , its music amplified by the sweet ache from his bladder . <p> " Incredible , " Neil murmured . <p> He had n't had erections for thirty years , yet this was already the fourth in half a day . He made no attempt to produce them ; they just happened , as they had every day of his adolescence . <p> This was n't like the inoculation with the Ponce de Leon Vaccine , which had halted his aging sixteen years ago , but kept him looking and feeling no better off than a healthy **25;635;TOOLONG . The mass media hoopla of the last six months came back to him like some sort of electronic echo , but the dreamlike impossibility of the reports was gone . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's population . He was young again . <p> Then why did it still feel as if his soul hung poised over the abyss of death ? He turned away from the mirror , no longer able to look . <p> His body seemed oblivious to any anxiety his mind could muster . He could have used his penis as a towel rack . <p> He shook his head slowly . " What , " he asked his erection , " am I supposed to do with you ? " <p> MILD INDIAN summer radiance stretched down the canyons of downtown buildings as Neil and Matthew joined the flow of pedestrians . Young face after young face ambled by , nearly all on attractive , physically fit bodies . A few children played , a few middle-aged types promenaded , trying to look distinguished ; otherwise , everyone seemed to be in their late teens to early thirties . <p> A month after his visit to the clinic , Neil had almost grown used to the absence of sagging flesh and rheumy eyes around him , despite all the decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elderly . It reminded him of college  --  another equally unreal part of his adult life . <p> " Do I really have to do this ? " Neil asked . <p> " Humor me , " Matthew said meaningfully . " You have to get out and about sooner or later . " <p> " I 've been busy . Architecture 's changed a bit since I last generated a set of blueprints . " Back then , such things were still duplicated on paper and were still sometimes blue . <p> " Gramps . . . " <p> Neil sighed . He 'd never shared a home with Matthew before these past few weeks . He 'd been surprised to learn that his grandson could be just as stubborn as he . <p> This time , Neil had conceded defeat , if only because the kid was right . Neil had been a hermit , and despite his excuses , all too little of his time had been spent at his interface studying to resume his career . For the most part he simply sat in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to lecture . Dr. Rosen had already done enough of that . All that talk about how the very old  --  and Neil was about as old as anyone on the planet  --  did n't always adapt to the installation of nanodocs . They exhibited " a reluctance to engage in life , " as if those who had fought the war against age were now suffering a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome . Some had gone as far as suicide . <p> That was their prerogative , Neil thought . Who said that a person had to act young just because he looked it ? Who said a person had to embrace immortality ? <p> " You 'll enjoy it out here , " Matthew said . <p> " You keep telling me that . " <p> " Trust me . This part of town did wonders for me just after I had my nanodocs installed . " <p> They turned a corner , arriving at their destination . <p> " My god , " Neil whispered . <p> The area was nothing like he remembered . The dingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a panoply of clean , bright facades with an abundance of glass , proudly displaying the interiors . Gone were the hawkers and the girls lounging like slung beef on the curbsides , replaced by stylish registration desks , openly displayed lists of services , and comfortable parlors for interviews between clients and artists . <p> The paint on the remodelled apartment house across the street rolled its molecules , shifting from an off-white to a deep beige that reflected the sun less harshly . The last time Neil had seen that building , its bottom floor had been festooned with handbills warning of AIDS . Those posters would be collector 's items now that nanodocs rendered any and all venereal diseases a part of the past , along with unintentional pregnancy . <p> The crowds of prospective clientele , still mostly male , wandered past the establishments like children at an amusement park . Joy soaked the air , a carefree piquancy that slid in with each inhalation , caressing taste buds on its way past the tongue like a fine , dry wine . Neil followed his grandson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes numbed by some new sight almost every instant . Matthew plunged ahead , clearly gripped by an aphrodisiacal contact high . <p> Two female artists chatted on the steps of a coffeehouse , taking a break during the lull between the morning rush of patrons and the traditional evening barrage . One of the women noticed Matthew 's attentiveness and turned slightly , providing both men with a view of a cleavage in which a banker could lose small change forever , if banks still used coins . <p> " Let 's go in here , " Matthew suggested . <p> Neil resisted the tug on his sleeve . " No . I 'd like to look around a bit more . " <p> Matthew raised an eyebrow and tilted his head toward the buxom artist . " You sure about that , Gramps ? " <p> " Yes . Maybe I 'll drop in later . If not , meet you at seven by the fountain . " Matthew shrugged . " Okay . See you then . " <p> Neil wandered . In its new incarnation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One place of business after another washed past him . None held his interest more than a few seconds . He thought he understood why Matthew had chosen to bring him here . Sex certainly was the epitome of " engaging in life . " And he could well believe all the therapeutic effect Matthew had personally derived from visits here . Matthew was seventy-two , and thanks to the vaccine had stopped aging at fifty-four . He 'd never been old enough for sex to lose its allure . <p> Neil drifted by a palatial bordello with a statue of Lily St. Cyr out front , continuing on even though the receptionist , in her elegant woman 's tuxedo , flashed him a wonderful smile . He ignored a tidy hotel with its rooms where , so the marquee claimed , the virtual whores were Custom Programmed by Maestro Roberto Niezca Himself . He even skipped the old-fashioned video arcades , something familiar from episodes of youthful curiosity or loneliness . <p> Finally he came to a three-story Victorian . " Gallery of Erotica " it read in Romanesque letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in their expressions passion rode serenely , absent the frantic urgency of most passersby . <p> Neil pressed the handpad , letting the gallery debit his account . The sibilant noises of the street vanished as the door swung shut behind him . <p> He meandered down an aisle filled with sculptures of bacchanalian orgies . In an alcove , a female mannequin wore lingerie that mutated at nano- levels through the fashions of many eras , from Colonial-era teddies to the brass inauguration bra made famous by Erotic Artists Guild president Elaine Agoura . Finally he came to a small section devoted to framed centerfolds from mid-20th century cheesecake magazines . <p> His glance lit on one he thought he recognized . He and Toby Wyckoff had found a cast-off Playboy once in a dumpster . The model had the same intensely black hair as that issue 's Playmate . Her breasts , naturally shapely  --  as opposed to the silicone balloons featured in later decades  --  pointed outward at an angle designed to knock teenage boys ' eyeballs out of their sockets . A bedsheet denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone for the camera in that day and age . <p> Neil wiped his palms on his shirt . How easily the memory bubbled up . Had he truly been that adolescent , crouched breathless in an alley behind a dumpster , acknowledging for the first time the undeniable tropism of sexuality ? <p> Yes . He had . <p> An hour later , emerging from the gallery , he drank in the ambience of the street with senses newly tuned . The redolent musk of sweat and arousal that wafted from open upper-story windows made him heady . A thousand nights ' worth of gasps , sighs , and moans seemed to pour out of the walls of every building on the street . <p> Maybe Matthew had been right to bring him here . It had awakened something . Perhaps it was n't so unreasonable to explore the feeling . <p> But not in this rain of fire . Despite all the changes , one thing about this part of town was the same : here , sex was a commodity . It was for jaded palates , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Neil 's palate was not jaded . He 'd been out of the game so long he was like a virgin . He could n't start with a business transaction . He 'd have to do things his way . <p> He headed for the fountain to wait for his grandson , treading like a snow leopard across the Himalayas , knowing a mate must be somewhere up there among the alpenglow and mist . <p> The party scene was the same backwater it had always been , with the same fish caught in its eddies , lacking the vitality to dare the rapids to the spawning pools . Neil endured it until , at a housewarming for a neighbor of Matthew 's , he met Thea . <p> Thea was long and statuesque , with a deep ebony complexion that may or may not have been her birth color  --  did it matter these days ? She came up to him as he sat , alone , on the patio retaining wall . <p> " Hello , you must be Neil , " she said . <p> Avoiding eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived with . " Your spouse seems to be the hit of the night in there . " " Oh , she 's not my spouse . Just my roommate . " <p> His cheeks reddened . " Whoops , " he said . She laughed in a way that told him both that she 'd taken no offense , and that she thought it hilarious that anyone would characterize her as homosexual . <p> " What do you . . . um , do ? " Neil asked . <p> " I 'm in household AI sales . Tell me , sir , do you want your door guard program to growl at Jehovah 's Witnesses or to politely tell them to fuck off and leave you alone ? " <p> Neil snorted into his beer . <p> Thea kept talking . She was easy to listen to . The stiffness leaked from his shoulders and spine . He stopped compulsively running his hands up and down the handle of his mug . Thea filled the dreaded long pauses when he could n't think of a thing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a phrase . She laughed at his jokes . <p> Gradually the conversation became real , more than small talk . Neil managed to get past his tendency at earlier parties to keep it light . Dr. Rosen said that trait was a defense mechanism , a habit left over from his twilight decades when any friend he made died . Old widowers risked much to try to forge deep relationships . Neil did n't care about the analysis . He just did what felt right . Heart pounding , he got the words out : " Can I see you again ? " <p> Thea played with one of her tightly kinked curls , like a cat next to a mouse it has trapped , letting the poor thing wonder if it will again set down its paw . " Yes . I would like that , " she said . <p> For their first date , they took the Slingshot up to low earth orbit , on a ten-hour tourist package Thea had signed up for on a whim years back . She 'd never canceled the reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd find someone who wanted to accompany her . <p> Neil and Thea spent the bulk of the visit strolling along the view decks of the Earthrise Mall , goggling at the starscape . Their favorite moments , though , took place in what Thea labeled " the trampoline chamber , " a sphere eighteen meters in diameter , attached to the space station just so Grounders could fly back and forth to their hearts ' content . They giggled like children , hysterical at the peculiar effect of weightlessness on their faces and figures . By the time they took their berths in the descent vehicle , they were so pleasantly exhausted that they napped for the last half of the glide to sea level . <p> As they strolled out of the station into a blustery night , Thea threw back her head and hooted enthusiastically , " Oh , I love doing new things , do n't you ? " <p> Her arm drifted into the crook of his elbow . Neil 's wits seemed to vanish into the breeze , knocked out of his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the cue . The decision , said her body with a theatrical shiver , was his . <p> She looked so perfect , black flesh framed against a black sky . The warmth of her radiated all the way from his cradled elbow up his arm and down his torso to his crotch . Yes , he told himself , trying to reestablish his ability to breathe . If she was ready , so was he . <p> SHE TOOK Neil into her with velvet-glove softness . She squirmed on top of him , rolling like an otter on the slick , firm surface of his torso . Her breasts tickled the hairs of his chest , pasting them down with her own sweat . Casting off his anxiety , he concentrated on pleasing her . <p> She was riding him again , much , much later , when his climax arrived . The ejaculation seemed to originate from the tips of his toes and the surface of his scalp , rushing to his penis and into her with flash-flood suddenness and force . As his hips collapsed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ! " she said , arching back and purring , still straddled across him . " What 'll we do tomorrow ? " <p> He opened his eyes , peering under heavy lids at her beaming , gratified smile . His body still basked in post-orgasmic tremors , but his mind was working again . He replayed her comment from earlier in the evening . " I love doing new things , do n't you ? " <p> The night lost the transcendence that came from banishing thirty-five years of abstinence . In its place rose the shame of having read the signs wrong . Neil choked down his disappointment . He began to count the days until Thea would no longer consider him to be " the new thing . " <p> Felice pranced across the tennis court , playing aggressively , forcing Neil to call upon old tricks to hold his own . Though small and fine-boned , she whacked the ball over the net with blistering vigor . The sweat flew from NeWs hair as he lunged to catch her serve . The upper quarter of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcing lazily to her side . <p> She caught it before the bounce , slamming it into a far corner of his court , far out of his reach . <p> " C'm on , Neil , " she yelled . " You can move those hunky thighs faster than that . " <p> He stuck out his tongue , and on her next serve , fed her the ball straight back to her face  --  another old trick . Startled , her backhand counterstroke fell apart . <p> " Barbarian ! " she called cheerfully . <p> Neil grinned , enjoying the steady pounding of his heart , the burn in his legs . But she 'd gotten him with the comment about sluggishness . He was trying hard , but whenever he flung himself full-tilt across the court , he recalled the time , at age 74 , when a knee had locked up without warning , sending him to the asphalt so hard he broke his nose . He 'd given up tennis at that point . <p> His body was good now . He should trust it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Felice . She seemed like just the person to ease the braises left by his three-week liaison with Thea . The winter had been long and lonely . <p> In other areas of his life , he was adjusting . He 'd resumed his architectural career . He 'd moved out of Matthew 's apartment into a place of his own . Dr. Rosen seemed satisfied with his progress . Yet this new world remained flat without a companion to share it with . <p> Felice was a miniature tornado . She played with a determination that intimidated blossoms right off the nearby trees . She was easy to admire , and it was likewise easy for him to imagine building on that respect until it included an erotic element . <p> He was thinking of that , not his stumbling , as their court time expired . <p> They collected their balls and ambled away , surrendering their spots to another couple . <p> " Good game , " he said . He 'd been ahead , but she 'd been coming up on him rapidly ; if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probably have won . He told her so . <p> " I did okay , " she said , shrugging in such a genuinely modest way that he could n't help but feel even better about her . The woman had no pretensions ; he did n't have to strut for her . He did n't have to invent compliments . <p> " Want to shower together ? " Neil asked . <p> Felice raised her eyebrows . He supposed she was wondering why go to the trouble  --  their nanodocs could scrub out their pores , dissolve the grit , and freshen them up . But showering together had a definite romance to it , like roasting marshmallows over a campfire under the starlight . He knew he was n't the only traditionalist left , or the locker rooms would n't still be there , over at the edge of the courts by the redwood grove . <p> " Sure , " she replied , as if catching his mood . " Why not ? " <p> The spray did wonderful things to Felice 's body . The rivulets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they negotiated her curves . The fine , almost transparent hairs at the base of her neck caught droplets like dew on strands of spider web in a morning garden . Her nipples rose . She arched her breasts toward him , as if to say , " Here , these need the touch of warm , soapy hands . " <p> He hesitated . The way her wet hair clung to her skull , and the color of it , reminded him of his own daughter  --  may she rest in peace  --  as a toddler . <p> " How old are you , Felice ? " he murmured . <p> Old enough , her wink told him , but she answered , again without guile , " Thirty . " <p> He 'd been a widower longer than she 'd been alive . Christ , she might not even have reset her age yet ; he might be seeing her natural youth . He stepped behind her , and used his warm , soapy hands  --  on her back . He did n't want to let his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She leaned into him , robbing her slick form against his . The spray could n't wash away , her fresh , feminine aroma . His penis stirred against the curve of her buttocks . <p> He shifted his hips away abruptly , as he would have done had a child , wriggling in his lap , prompted an inadvertent sexual response . <p> He needed time . An evening of candlelight and good food would reshape his mood , make him forget the ninety year difference in their ages . Even a few minutes might be enough , but not now , with the water rinsing away the delicacy of his fantasies . <p> He did n't have time . The stiffening of her shoulders told him she 'd taken offense . <p> Ah , thought Neil , he 'd buried himself now . She 'd made an offer , and he had slapped it down . She would n't leave herself open for rejection a second time . If he wanted anything to happen later , he 'd have to pursue her with diligence . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him no encouragement until her ego had recovered . <p> But he did n't want to pursue her with that kind of fervor until he was more sure of his feelings for her . Yet to delay would surely cause yet another insult . He did n't have to be a genius to know that all too soon , Felice would be looking for a new tennis partner . <p> Slowly , like a senior citizen , Neil rinsed the soap from his hands . <p> Daffodils bloomed along the walkways of the cemetery . The heat of late spring had already shriveled natural daffs , but here the yellow King Alfreds and orange-and-tan Saharan Lords stood tall and proud , maintained by their own versions of nanodocs , programmed by the groundskeeper . <p> Neil followed a route his feet had traveled many times before , until the headstones took on dates-of-birth that sent a burble of acid up his esophagus. 1950. 1955. 1960. 1965 . The last generation to die of old age . He could find the names of kindergarten classmates on those marble and granite markers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here , too . But that burst appendix had n't claimed him , the lymphoma had been treatable , that drunk driver had swerved at the last moment . Here he was . <p> An ancient oak tree shaded the particular resting site that he had come to see . Weather had muted the sharpness of the carved letters . He scanned across the name to the impossible date-of-death . How had thirty-two years passed with so little in them ? <p> Kneeling he placed a lavender rose upon the grass , over the spot he imagined his good wife 's heart to be . <p> " You spoiled me , Stacey , " he said to the earth . " You set my damn standards too high . " <p> Was that it ? Was he carrying a torch ? Was her ghost jealously guarding him , perhaps ? Convenient , to think it was only that . <p> The rose caught a sunbeam that slipped through the oak leaves . The petals drooped in the increasing heat . The flower had not been programmed to last . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A family appeared through the cemetery gates , making a procession toward a large crypt near the fountain . Every adult of the group walked on long , supple legs , their unlined faces tilted away from the day 's brilliance . <p> Two lanky men , so similar in appearance they could 've been twins , brought up the rear . From their body language , Neil doubted they were twins . More likely the one on the left was the great-grandfather of the one on the right . <p> Neil worked his way back through the graves . At the entrance , a woman stepped onto the lawn with a small bouquet in her hands . As the distance between them closed , he automatically made eye contact . <p> Her fine reddish curls and her figure brought a concealed smile of appreciation to his face , but when he saw recognition spark in her green eyes , he stopped short . So did she . <p> " I know you , do n't I ? " she said . <p> " Yes , " he replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nanodocs were implanted . " <p> " My morning-after , too . " She looked at her bouquet , and then at a set of headstones , as if measuring the distance between the two . But she did n't walk on . Instead , she smiled . <p> " My name 's Neil . " " Nadine . " <p> Neil and Nadine  --  it had a nice , alliterative ring . Suddenly his scheduled plans for the rest of the morning dissipated . <p> " Are you a local girl ? " he asked , waving at the cemetery . " Family here ? " <p> " Just my husband . He died not long after we retired out here in ' 41 . I did n't see much point in moving him or me back to Texas . So ah jus ' stuck him in th ' ground with his boots pointed up . " A chuckle accompanied her last sentence , adding to the color of the deliberately exaggerated twang . Neil recognized that kind of mirth ; it was the type people used to bandage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil said , half to himself , " when I saw you on that bench outside the clinic , I just naturally assumed you were twenty-two . Old habits , I guess . " <p> Abruptly she raised the bouquet to her nose , covering a bashful smile . She glanced again toward the headstones . " Would you excuse me for a moment . . . Neil ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> She nodded , grateful for his instant understanding , and traced her way across the cemetery . Neil found a shady spot beneath an oak much like the one growing near Stacey Corbin 's resting spot . He sat on a retaining wall , watching the patterns of the clouds in the sky . Nadine joined him there , sans bouquet . <p> A babble of thoughts seemed to dance across her brow . Neil tentatively broke the silence by asking her occupation . <p> " I was in furniture sales , " she answered . " But there 's not much need to sell things like new sofas when a homeowner can just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a spare from garden dirt . So I 've shifted into interior design . You 'd be amazed how picky everyone 's become about their decor , now that they can afford any style they want , and can change it every day . " <p> " No , I would n't be amazed , " he said , and told her of some of the home redesign requests that had flooded his office . <p> Before Neil knew it , an hour had passed , and his mouth had become cottony from all the conversation . Suddenly Nadine glanced at her watch . " Oh , my lord ! I have to go ! " She winced , as if wishing she 'd forgotten to put the timepiece on that morning . <p> " Can I take you out to dinner some time ? " he asked . The question tumbled out without having to think about it . <p> The green of her eyes deepened , or was that just the widening of her pupils ? " Yes . " <p> " How about tomorrow night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead ? " <p> She laughed at his tiny frown of disappointment . " You northern boys are so impatient . " She lifted her hand up . Recognizing the gesture , he kissed her knuckles . <p> A trace of a shiver rolled along her arm . <p> " We have plenty of time , " Nadine said . She gave him her Link access number and turned to go . <p> Yes , Neil thought , watching the wiggle of her hips as she disappeared down the street . Time . Deep inside himself , he turned from the trophies and record books and team photos on his shelf , and looked toward the open track ahead . His feet were in the starting block . <p> What did one hundred twenty years of the past matter , compared to a thousand years of the future ? Heading home , Neil repeated Nadine 's number under his breath until it became part of him . <p> <p> <p> By Dave Smeds <p> Dave Smeds is the author of two fantasy novels : The Sorcery Within and its sequel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anthologies such as In the Field of Fire , Sword and Sorceress , and Future Earths : Under African Skies , as well as in magazines from Pulphouse to Ghosttide . <p>
