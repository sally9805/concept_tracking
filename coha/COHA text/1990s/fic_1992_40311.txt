I had been told hours ago that I would be called to the reform office to get my release I.D . As soon as I got it , my term would be over and I would walk away , through the big iron gate , once again a free man , fee to drop into any restaurant on the island and eat as much as I wanted . I was too hungry to be excited . <p> My sleep the night before had been restless and full of unmemorable dreams . I had been waiting with an empty stomach in the cement yard for more than ten hours . <p> Prisoners were usually released before lunchtime . On the day they went free , they customarily gave their morning rations to other inmates . As soon as they got out , they would enjoy a huge meal in the restaurant of their choice . <p> I had already given away my lunch ration , but I had not yet been summoned to the office . I had been watching the shadow of the high stone wall moving across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be past three-thirty . <p> One of the inmates ran to me and said , " Hey , the chief wants you to come over to his office right away . " Some of the prisoners in the cement yard whistled at me , and Wang , the No. 1 trusty , rising from the long iron bench , said , " Now , relax , lucky man . " <p> I had been sitting on my bundle since early morning , when the barracks seemed to melt into the cold mists emerging from the lake . My legs felt numb , and I was dizzy as I tried to stand . <p> After lunch a group of prisoners returning from the washing sink had embraced me . Among them was Wang , who enthusiastically warned me that I must n't eat too much for my first meal out of prison . He said a full meal would devastate a starved prisoner 's empty stomach . On this day all the distrust between us had magically disappeared . Wang spoke to me as though to a close friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some right on the ground . Sanbao , who was searching for leftovers in the trash can , turned around and shouted , " Wait a minute ! I do n't understand . Control yourself before food ? Nonsense ! I 'd rather control myself before a stark-naked girl . " <p> " Shut up ! " Wang barked at him . " Mind your own business . " <p> In camp , rebelling against the No. 1 trusty was sometimes even worse than ignoring a prison officer . If you disobeyed the officer , you were put into a cell , but if you did n't yield to Wang 's authority , you were given " tight shoes " to wear every day . A prisoner who went against Wang stood to lose everything . <p> Wang had been a carpenter before his arrest . No one knew much about his crime . He had already spent twelve years in the camp . He never went to the quarry . One inmate who did not give a damn for him was Zhang , a former university professor who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry crack in his voice Zhang said , " Nonsense . I would eat as much as I wanted to if I were he . " Zhang was very popular in the camp . He had written letters to the Central Party Committee criticizing the Cultural Revolution . That was why he came to serve a ten-year term . Prisoners respected him , some even feared him , because he could eat a kilogram of lard together with a basin of rice powder without a break . No one else in the camp could do that . Of course , he had an extraordinarily large mouth . He was able to stuff one whole hand into his mouth , up to the wrist , without gagging . He loved to con newcomers out of their food by performing this trick for them . He wore a pair of glasses without the right earpiece , tied around his right ear with a piece of string . <p> " You probably would . You are the top eater among us , " Wang said , grinning . <p> " What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stomach ? " Zhang grew more angry . <p> " I mean it would ruin an ordinary stomach  --  I would n't say it would ruin yours if you were out of prison and going to a restaurant , " Wang said slowly , still with a grin on his face . <p> Zhang had always been a problem for Wang . Could he give Zhang tight shoes , as he did the other prisoners who did n't respect him ? Oh , no . It did n't work on Zhang . During his years in the prison camps Zhang had been put into solitary confinement five times . And his right leg had been broken by guards three years earlier , when he refused to obey an order to go stand against a wall . So now he was crippled . Yet , as he remarked , he never bent his spine to any power . <p> " Bullshit ! " Zhang barked , and flew at Wang . <p> I stood by like a referee . Both the fighters turned quickly toward me . Their eyes were narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them circled facing each other , and Zhang bared his teeth and growled like a dog . His mouth was so enormous that I imagined him biting Wang on the shoulder and tearing a big piece of flesh from the joint . Then Wang , taller than Zhang and taking advantage of his height , moved in quickly and seized Zhang by the collar . <p> " Bite ! " he said in a quick breath . He was still grinning . His long , bare arms and fingers trembled as he held Zhang 's collar . <p> At that moment the bell tolled for afternoon work . The fighters simultaneously loosened their grip on each other . Wang sank to the bench , and Zhang ran off to catch the line of prisoners heading for the quarry . But , as though he 'd suddenly remembered something important , he came back to me . <p> " Take care , now . Do n't believe what he said . " He still had n't caught his breath , and managed only broken curses at Wang , who relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at Wang and said before leaving , " We 'll have time later ! " <p> My release was apparently scheduled for late in the afternoon . The chief had given me a lecture the night before and asked me two questions  --  why was I arrested and did I deserve my freedom  --  to which I had never been able to give satisfactory answers . <p> " You should think of the day you came here , " the chief said . " It 's certainly the most important day of your life . " <p> I thought , How could I even forget that day ? My arrest was still so clear to me that it seemed to have happened yesterday . It had been like most other days . I had been playing the violin in my bedroom . I could still smell the familiar fragrance of Linan , my girlfriend , who had been there with me for most of the afternoon and had just left for home . The sun was going down , and the little room was starting to darken . Looking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drooping willows , leading away from the house . Beyond stood the ruins of the ancient gateway , which were already covered in shadows . <p> Carefully I moved the music stand close to the window , for the last light . I was about to turn the page to the next piece when I felt someone tap me on the shoulder . I thought that Linan had come back to pick up a book on the table . I was usually unaware of her entrance into my room until I heard her soft voice or felt her slender hand resting on my shoulder . <p> I moved a little toward the music stand in order to let her sit down on my bed . But someone snatched my violin away and knocked the bow violently onto the floor . Turning around , I saw three strangers in khaki . The tall man who stood closest to me took a pair of handcuffs from his black canvas bag and announced in a low but firm voice , " You are under arrest . " The other two moved quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and kind . I could tell by his accent that he had grown up in the same district of the city in which I had spent my boyhood . I wanted time to prepare . I was about to ask the tall man for a few minutes when I found that his face had hardened into a cold , wooden stare . <p> Several months before , I had bought a portrait of Chairman Mao from a local bookstore and had come back to hang it on my bedroom wall . That night I invited a few friends to my room to have a small party . Once seated , with my drink in front of me , I cursed Aunt Wu , the chairperson of the neighborhood committee , for having relentlessly pestered me to buy the portrait . I recalled that the first time she had entered my room she 'd seemed surprised to see the bare white walls . She stared at them and then at me as though she 'd discovered a terrible secret , and said , " Do you know that all the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging in them ? " When she visited me two days later , she said , " Next time I drop in , I expect to see a Treasured Portrait hanging on the wall . " The third time she stepped into my room , I was playing violin with three of my friends . She shouted behind us , " Stop playing that music . Go right now and get a Treasured Portrait or I 'll let you know what ' the Proletarian Dictatorship ' means ! " <p> So I ran to the nearest bookstore and bought the portrait in which Chairman Mao , dressed in a military uniform , raised his right hand to wave at the Red Guard in greeting . His raised hand seemed especially large , and his smile was proud . I did n't much care for this image , with its powerful hand and self-indulgent smile , and the idea of it hanging on my bedroom wall bothered me . I could n't help feeling that Mao was staring down at us while we played music  --  even worse , when I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , I felt the wine and my anger blend into a rage . I tore the portrait into pieces . At that very moment Aunt Wu , without knocking , entered my room . <p> Had I been punished right then , I would n't have felt so shocked . What struck me was that they did n't arrest me at that time . I went to the police station the next day with Linan and gave a confession , as Aunt Wu had instructed . They told me to go back home and wait . Linan began visiting me more frequently , and almost every time she would say , " So , it has been all right today ? " <p> It had been all right for three months . Then a campaign called " Digging the class enemy from every corner " began . Five percent of the population was to be arrested . In order to fill the percentage quota in my residential area , they should arrest five people . And I was one of the five . In terms of official classification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> During my time in the camp I was forced to read Mao 's books . I could recite his words : " We are required to make different policies in different circumstances in order to catch up with the development of class struggle . " You could be free today but arrested tomorrow , simply because the situation had changed . <p> So here I was in the prison yard , waiting . I faced the long one-story building of the camp , which was then as quiet as a temple . Looking through my group 's door , I was able to see the bunk I 'd slept on for five years and , above it , the one that Sanbao slept on . I had had to put up with the nasty smell of him since he 'd moved there , the year before ; he never took a bath , not even in summer . He had been in so long that he did n't see any reason to wash himself . <p> As I looked at the closely packed bunks , I was pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . Behind me was a high gray stone wall topped with a foot of iron grillwork . A smooth path ascended the slope behind it . Twice a day I had walked up that path to the quarry , and twice a day I had come back , for the whole five years . When I walked along the path , I prayed to survive : every month three or four prisoners were killed by falling stone . <p> According to the customs of the prison camp , before being released  --  just as on my first day , when I had moved into the camp  --  I was to place all my things in the cement yard and let Wang check out everything , bit by bit . <p> " Do n't frown like that . A five-year prison term is not long . Many guys here have got ten more years to go . " This was what Wang had told me when he checked my stuff as I entered the camp . It was true . Five years seemed not to have been long as I recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple : the five-year prison term had come to an end . I realized that my thoughts were much simpler now than they had been five years before . I had lost my interest in music . Even the fact that Linan had gotten married a few months earlier hardly shocked me . Now all I thought of was going to a small restaurant , the one on the village quay . From the top of the quarry the prisoners often gazed down at this restaurant , watching people go in and out and the smoke rise up from the long chimney behind it . We had talked about it almost every day when we saw the smoke coming out . All the prisoners in the camp , no matter where they came from , compared the length of their sentences and dreamed of the day of their release , when they could sit at a real table and eat their fill . Be he an artist , a scientist , or just a farmer , it made no difference : a prisoner would look at the smoke and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my boyhood I 'd had a dream of becoming a musician . How stupid I had been then . <p> My mother had written to me frequently in the past few months , and in her letters she always complained about what I wrote back to her . " You seem to forget all the words that you learned in school . Your handwriting has been getting worse and worse . And in each of your letters I find at least ten grammar mistakes .... " Mother could not have understood that for five years a small restaurant had embodied my ambitions and all the wonders of freedom . <p> As Wang began to check my things , I noticed five local girls with bamboo containers on their backs walking down the slope toward camp . I recognized the two girls in the lead . I remembered that I had talked with them two or three months earlier , when the prisoners went to see a movie at the main square of the camp headquarters . I had boasted to them that I owned six brand-new jackets and many new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wore stockings except during festivals . But the truth was that I had nothing decent in my wooden case or in my bundle , which was now opened and spread on the ground . I felt uneasy and hurried to the lavatory , where I had often hidden myself in order to avoid the thought-reform classes at night . When I came out of the lavatory a few minutes later , the girls were gone . <p> The only thing I was leaving behind was a small wooden box I had given to Sanbao the night before . Sanbao had tried many times to pry this box open with his chopsticks , but had never succeeded . The box , which I always put beside my pillow , was where I kept my rice powder , which had wafted from every joint and encircled my head . Sanbao had always sniffed deeply and cursed , " Oh , my God ! I ca n't live without it . I ca n't sleep ! " The night before , while packing , I had seen him staring at the box again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I offered it to him anyway . Sanbao seemed grateful , for he helped me with the rest of my stuff right after I gave him the box . " You 're the guy that I 've regarded as my only friend here , though I never said it to you before . I 'm not just trying to flatter you . " <p> " You 're not ? " I said . <p> " We 'll meet again outside the prison if I can survive my term , and by that time we 'll be able to eat as much as we like in the restaurant , " Sanbao said joyfully . <p> Thinking of the meal , I felt my mouth begin to water . I tried to calm myself . What if something at the last moment prevented my release ? Such things happen . Two weeks earlier a prisoner had come to the end of his term , only to be told to stay in camp until he finished the work that he 'd left undone during his eight years here  --  quarrying two thousand tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred days . I had never failed in five years to mine my daily stone ration . But what about my thought-reform course ? I had never been able to give a satisfactory answer as to why I had been arrested . I knew that I would n't be able to survive such a setback , and would collapse in no time . I began to prepare myself for the worst . That 's what all prisoners do . <p> I walked slowly toward the reform office , my bundle and my wooden case in either hand . My old leather boots grated on the cement . My hunger and tiredness had gone , and I felt a sudden strength surge through my legs , as though I could run right out through the gates and into the fields beyond . <p> A hundred or more prisoners stopped working and fixed their envious eyes on my back . " Look at the guy , " they would say . " He is going to the small restaurant . " Two newcomers , who had arrived the previous day , stopped as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Both held iron rakes in their hands . Both looked pale and thin . As I looked into their eyes , I could read the number of years they had to serve . I stopped and nodded a good-bye to them . They nodded back silently . <p> The chief was enjoying a cup of tea at his large black desk , which was almost identical to the one behind which the judge who sentenced me had been seated . When I entered the reform office , the chief seemed to ignore me utterly . As an old-timer , I knew what to do before the authorities . Do n't touch their nerves . Wait patiently for them , but do n't make then wait for you . The chief 's face was totally in shadow , so I could n't gauge his mood . Finally he put aside his cup and said , " Come here . " I sensed some hostility in his voice . I walked up to the big desk and stood in front of the chief , holding my breath . <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " What are you thinking now ? " <p> I tried to say something , but no words came . What was I thinking about ? I suddenly thought that everything would have been different if I had n't torn up the portrait of Chairman Mao and given myself up the the police . " You must be thinking of your meal outside , " the chief said . <p> " Yes , I am , " I confessed . <p> " How did you do with your thought reform ? " <p> " Well enough . " <p> " Tell me why you were arrested and if you deserve your freedom . " <p> I was sick of this question . Why was I arrested ? It was very simple : I was arrested because of the percentage quota , because of the requirement of the political situation . But if I spoke out , the chief would n't let me go . So I said , " I have washed my criminal soul with my sweat in hard labor during my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have once been a counterrevolutionary , " the chief said . <p> " I wo n't , " I said . <p> The chief took out my release I.D . together with eighty yuans from his drawer . " Be careful with them , " he said . I was allowed to leave . <p> When I passed through the main entrance of the prison , I stopped to show my I.D . to the guard . He looked me up and down for a long while before he checked my I.D . Then he yelled , " Pass ! " <p> I walked out and trudged along a dirt road toward a small town in which , I remembered vaguely , a winding street led to the quay . But I had first passed the street long ago , on my way to the prison camp . Now I had to look right and left to make sure that I was going in the right direction . <p> A large portrait of Mao at the entrance to the street drew my attention . The portrait was on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeling away and I saw a rip as big as half my palm right on Mao 's chin . Beneath the portrait a quotation from Mao was printed clearly in red : " Never forget  --  struggle ! " But the other part of the slogan was hidden by a woman 's pink underwear and blue skirt , which hung on a long piece of bamboo pole sticking out of a nearby window . All I could see was " Revolution is not a dinner party ! " <p> Something might have changed . Mother had written to me recently that Aunt Wu had been friendly to her . " She promised to help you get odd jobs when you come home , " Mother said . In another letter Mother wrote , " Yesterday morning when I went to the market street , I met Aunt Wu again . She said that she had gone to a Buddhist temple three times to burn incense . And she asked me to go there with her to burn incense for you . " I did n't much believe in Buddhist grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the woman 's underwear , which was waving gently in the wind , I felt at ease . <p> Then I reached the street . I followed two young women who stepped out of a beauty parlor ; they were talking about the latest fashions . A group of children with bags on their backs were playing hide-and-seek on the corner ahead . An old man in gray , with a hopeful look on his face , was bending to dig through a rubbish heap . People seemed not to know that a labor camp was only several hundred yards away from their community . The two women turned into a lane . I walked along the street . I felt my shirt and jacket soaked through with sweat , but I did n't stop walking . <p> At the inn I asked an old man where I could store my luggage . The old man looked me up and down just like the prison guard and got up from his chair . " For how long ? " <p> " Just overnight , " I said . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn and said , " Here you are . " <p> The house was filled with the stench of chemical fertilizer . <p> " That 's it ? " I asked . <p> " Yes . " <p> " But this room stinks ! " <p> " You can take your things somewhere else . " <p> I went back to the inn to reserve a bed for my first night out of prison . I had to show my I.D . again . But I was not treated as sternly as in prison . A well-dressed young woman put my name in the lodgers ' book while talking excitedly to a young man about some furniture that she 'd happened to see in a show when she visited Shanghai the day before . She said that she 'd like her wedding room to be furnished like that . And the young man promised to buy it as soon as possible . Raising her eyes from the ledger , she asked me , " Light brown is in fashion , is n't it ? " I did n't know any fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out , I felt reassured , because I did n't have to show my release I.D . to anyone else on the island and because the small restaurant , though not yet open , was right there on the opposite corner . Through the large windows I could see the dishes arranged on the counter . Green pepper with pork , fried chicken , yellow fish , and meatballs . <p> I went to a store next to the restaurant and bought a pack of cigarettes . Then I stood in front of the restaurant window . When I was almost finished with my cigarette , the restaurant opened . <p> I ordered five dishes and bought a bottle of liquor . I found myself a table in a vacant room that looked grubby and bleak . On the wall on the left side of the room was a portrait of Chairman Mao , smiling at me as I stepped in with my bottle . Everything looked lousy and old . The wooden table was greasy ; one of the two chairs was missing its backrest ; the other had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow and bore many dark spots , no doubt from the smoke of the stove , whose chimney poked through the ceilingless roof . On the opposite side was a set of long , narrow windows in the style of the Ming dynasty , and two large spider webs hung in the upper corners of each . I could see into another dining room , next to mine ; its four tables were covered with tablecloths and all the chairs were brand-new . I preferred the one I was in , however , because I do n't like people watching me at my meal . <p> So I sat on the chair without crossbars . " Dinner , dinner , " I murmured , picking up a pair of chopsticks . Then I rubbed the bare wooden table with my sleeves and poured myself a glass of liquor . A wonderful smell came floating through the room from behind me . Turning around , I saw a young waitress in a white apron bringing out a tray . She had two plates of food : one was fired fish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them down on the table , I saw clearly that her slender fingers looked like Linan 's and her bare arms , also like Linan 's , were covered with a layer of fine brown hair . <p> In all the years in camp I had n't had a chance to see a woman 's hands up close . Now , as I watched the waitress 's hands moving gently before me , I truly felt free . <p> I put two pieces of fried fish into my mouth and drank a toast to my freedom . The room seemed bright now . Through the windows I saw a bank of old timbers topped with broken tiles . I remembered a similar pile of rafters in front of my own room at home . Under those rafters had been a stone-paved area where I used to gather with my friends when I was a little boy . Sometimes we did n't go to school , and instead hid our bags in one of the holes among the wall 's ruins . Then we went to play fighting games on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it grew late . Someone among us would have to remind the others to take our bags out of the hole . As we left , each of us was trying to construct an alibi for his parents . I remembered that I had taken Linan to visit some of my friends , and to the place where I used to hide my backpack . She seemed very interested in the game I had played with the other boys . She said , " I would not have wasted my childhood if I had been able to play with you in those days . " <p> We treasured our time together . Sometimes we sat side by side under those old timber rafters . Sometimes , when it was raining outside , we spent hours in my room , gazing at the rain dripping from the edges of the rafters . The soft sound was like distant music . I seemed to hear the music again . <p> " Do you hear the sound of the raindrops outside ? " Linan whispered to me , leaning against my shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to stay here with you and watch the raindrops fall from the rafters , " she said . <p> We were sitting in my room and looking through the window at the rain outside . We were silent . All was quiet but the raindrops . <p> The past continued to appear soundlessly in my thoughts : Behind my room was a long , narrow canal . During summer days young girls from nearby villages steered their boats skillfully with bamboo poles into the crisscross canal . They would shout , " Lotus seeds ! Lotus roots ! Three bunches for a yuan . " Then I remembered how my grandpa would often take me to the serene gardens in my home town . I was fascinated by the bonsai : " scenery in pots . " Grandpa would point to a tiny tree in a pot and tell me that it might be five hundred years old . My favorite goldfish were there in all shapes and colors : red lionheads , black pearls , and purple skirts , swimming leisurely in those huge ponds in the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt myself almost carried away by this wave of memory washing over me . <p> I filled my glass again and swallowed the whole glassful . I was about to finish the pork when the young waitress came over with the rest of my food . I tried to rise from the chair to help her , but I failed . Then I tried to say something to her . I felt my mouth move , but no words came out . She turned back quickly and left . <p> I unfastened the top button of my shirt . I concentrated on the new dishes : one was fried chicken , and the other two were meatballs . Each of the two dishes held six meatballs . During my five years in the camp I had eaten only three meatballs . Each prisoner got one on Spring Festival Day each year . I should have had five , but two of them had been stolen by Sanbao . How I had longed for those meatballs . <p> I heard music coming from next door . I stopped eating and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I were holding a bow and played an invisible violin there in the shabby room . <p> At that very moment I felt someone tap me gently on the shoulder . Turning around , I saw a middle-aged man standing behind me . He had a serious expression on his face . <p> " I 'm the manager of this restaurant , " he said , introducing himself . <p> " I 'm eating here by myself , " I said , and hit the table with my chopstick . <p> " I know . I have to tell you to stop drinking right now , or you 'll have to get out . " <p> " Why ? " I asked him . <p> " Have you heard the news over the radio just now ? " the manager asked me . <p> " I 'm not interested in any news on the radio . " <p> " Well , I 'll tell you what , " the manager said . " It is the saddest moment for all the people in this country . Our great leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused for a while and then went on . " All kinds of entertainment should be stopped for two weeks . You have to stop enjoying your drink and your food ... " <p> We remained face to face for a few seconds at the table on which half the fried chicken and my twelve meatballs remained untouched . Then I turned my head in order to calm myself down . On the wall Chairman Mao 's face smiled at me . <p> " It 's my dinner . It 's not entertainment . " I turned back and raised a finger at the manager . <p> At that moment the waitress came . She handed me two paper bags and said , " You can take them home . " Then she took my glass and the bottle still half filled with liquor . The waitress had not spoken to me before . Her voice sounded so soft and sweet that I could n't show my anger in front of her . I watched her putting my meatballs into a paper bag , hoping that she would give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . But it was not the knowing look I had expected . She looked at me with a wooden stare , like that of the tall man who had arrested me five years ago . <p> It was raining when I walked out of the restaurant , and the cold wind cleared my mind . For a moment I gazed at the paper bags in my hands . Then I turned around and threw them at a haystack . <p> The evening was dark and windy . Not a soul was in sight . Suddenly the funeral march sounded from the loudspeakers hanging on the cement poles every few hundred feet in the street ahead . <p>
