Today is my fortieth birthday . I do n't feel old at all . I 've been sitting here for a while , on this courtyard bench , and if she 's coming , then she 's late . Married couples walk around , trying to interest each other , pointing to the faded pink walls and to the iron balustrades . The men tell the women facts from guidebooks , pretending these are things they know . Wind fans the blond hair of one young man as he takes a surreptitious photo of his bride . Photos are n't allowed here . She grins pinkly , arranges her white hat over an ear . I can see how happy this makes her-not the photo , but the consciously illegal pose . They 'll look at the picture years from now and remember most of all the camera 's secret whir . <p> I do n't see anyone who looks like my wife , but then I 'm not sure what she looks like these days . In college , where I first met her in the mid-sixties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , professorial bars , psychology debates-and always entered late . It was her rule to be obvious . She 'd show up in a brown plaid dress and blond hair curled in a neat cyclone on her head , and everyone would watch . They all would notice this strange thing-her eyebrows were painted on , and one was drawn in a hysterical , curious arch . That was what I first noticed in her : this painted expression . <p> We never talked until the day she grabbed me outside the refectory and insisted I go with her to audition for a movie filming in Providence . I refused until she intimated that my overbreeding showed in my lack of adventure . So I went , and I remember they wrote down on my card " handsome college type " and on Britta 's " wild girl type " and we both got parts somehow . It was a terrible Rock Hudson movie , Halls of Ivy , and if you ever catch it late at night on television , you will see Britta 's gigantic hat and laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one second , the frame of action slows , drawn curling and enamored into the bewildering dream of her life . <p> So we dated for a while , the kind of formal dating set up back then . At least , that was how it began , but Britta was n't interested in wearing a sweater across her shoulders and having me serenade her . I think she saw in me just enough reticence to be a challenge , just enough self-control , but also the kind of curiosity that , in spite of myself , made me smile and shake my head and follow her . The Rock Hudson movie , the greyhound races , the shop of occult necklaces and masks . She would try on a headdress of silver coins and turn to me , that eyebrow leering under the mail , and I thought here was a girl who could never come home to Kentucky . <p> Once in a while she went to my parties . There was one in 1964 , a New Year 's party in Boston held by a fellow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a beautiful apartment , with an iron spiral staircase and brass Indian poppies littering the railing . It was Beacon Hill , and everybody there was Harvard or Yale or Brown ; the rule was always no Princeton ever because they stole the girls . The Jabberwocks loved Britta , but you could see the other Pembroke girls in their navy woolen kneesocks and yellow oxford button-downs cringing , shocked sometimes at Britta 's loud banging walk or clumsy maneuver with the matron 's teapot . Britta embarrassed me , too , getting " clobbered , " as the Jabberwocks liked to say , at cocktail parties and relating filthy stories to amazed young men , keeping us waiting forever while she searched a gutter for a Celtic necklace she had lost there-a hollow silver band which rattled at a touch , for inside were druidic talismans of hope . I bought her that necklace . She played an awful doubles tennis , but our opponents always asked for more matches because Britta 's constant deep laughter was entrancing . <p> She and I walked into the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we had to drink Gibsons , which Britta pretended she preferred . A few men were in the corner singing a drunken " Aura Lee . " <p> " You know where I 'd rather be , " Britta whispered to me . <p> " Do tell , darling " I replied , looking around at all the school ties . <p> " On an island . " <p> " Any island , darling ? " <p> She stared and me and clicked her tongue . " No no no . I 'm very specific , and very serious . Saint Eustatius . It 's Dutch , with a rain forest and a volcano and very mystical crabs . " <p> " Those islands are colder than you think . I 've been there with my mother . " <p> " But it 'd be great . I would n't ever drink Gibsons , or listen to ' Aura Lee . ' I 'd be a pirate , a gilded white scorpion . Would n't it be wonderful ? " <p> I did n't say anything , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the balcony , I caught my friend Marshall all alone , smoking a long cigarette and staring at a view he must have found tiresome . <p> " What kind of host are you ? " I asked . <p> " It is n't my party , really . Sally wanted it . " A Radcliffe girl he 'd been seeing , and seemed bored with . He waved his hand girlishly . " You and Britta are my only friends here . " <p> He must have said this for Britta 's sake , for she was just then arriving through the glass door , saying something to a group inside who laughed suddenly and loudly . She turned to us , closed the door , and rolled her eyes . <p> Marshall blew smoke out and asked her , " How can you do it ? Why does everybody love you , Britta ? " <p> " Are you saying nobody loves you ? " I broke in . <p> " Oh , that 's no trick at all , " Britta answered him , shaking her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ask people about themselves . They go on and on and then turn and tell their girlfriends what a marvelous conversationalist you are . " <p> I remember she smiled and turned away from him to go back inside , breaking her own rule to make Marshall think he had been let into some secret life of hers , a crueler one . <p> Marshall was new to the Jabberwocks , still a sophomore like me and slightly in awe of the secret ceremonies and histories of the group , though things like school and girls seemed not to interest him . He was tall , with curly red hair and nearly invisible eyebrows , but handsome and resolutely Irish in his chin and small , pink lips . <p> We had become friends only that Thanksgiving , when we were both invited to be on the Floor Committee of the National Debutante Cotillion in Washington . We took the train together , drinking Scotch the whole way , and met our stiff and beautiful debutante dates quite drunk , our hair messed up and our red sashes disarrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , their escorts two steps behind , the girls were quite serious , but Marshall and I had a blast despite them . We had been to enough cotillions to be bored of the rituals . When the waltz came , and all the escorts were to tap the fathers ' shoulders and release the girls into the world of men , we both took our dates into foolish jitterbugs , then waltzed off with each other to the bar . No one said a word , because Marshall 's family was powerful-wealthy Washingtonian Democrats who had been invited to the front row of the Kennedy funeral . That night at the New Year 's Eve party , I remember he wore a tie clip with a small photograph of Jack Kennedy under gold mesh . The tie was Andover . Mine was Kent School for Boys . Those things mattered to us then . <p> " Hey , Paul , " he said to me . " Did Barick say you were moving up to tenor ? " <p> " He 's making me . He 's crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was cold . Yet we were drunk enough not to mind being alone out there . The only light came through the eyelet curtains , and it beaded on our backs like luminous rain we could not shake . The air was deep blue , and all in front of us , Boston spread out in a sagging post-Christmas carnival . <p> Marshall went on , " Oh , he likes the idea of a black-haired tenor . He 's tired of us redhead Irish stealing the show every time . " <p> " But I 'm Irish . I 'm Black Irish . " <p> He seemed determined on this point , shaking his empty glass which glowed in the dim light like a deep-sea creature : " No , no . You , my friend , are Scotch Irish . You can tell from that nose you 're a rogue clan . You have to have dominion over everything , especially women and horses . That 's the South . That 's your dear old Kentucky-every one of them rogue Scotch Irish . " <p> " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He turned away from me and lit a cigarette . " What does he do again ? " <p> " He 's on the radio . " <p> " Runs the station ? " <p> " No , " I said , laughing a little and letting him pour me more gin from a bottle at his side . " He has a show . He 's Mr. Social Security for Western Kentucky . They ask him questions , and he answers them . He 's kind of famous . " <p> " Wow . That 's strange , Paul . " <p> I pictured my family sitting in our living room in the summer , the electric fans blowing and my mother sorting her Butterick patterns while we listened to my father over the radio . He advised old , frightened Kentuckians in that countrified way of his about how the government would provide , always and forever . It was a government-sponsored show . " This is the Age of America , " he always said to those folks , and they were grateful to hear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proud to have comforted them , people who had lived through so much , their children always hungry , going to bed cold . My father knew all of that-his family lost a logging mill in the Depression . All of our money came from my mother . <p> I am proud of him now , but back then it was an embarrassment . I did not know why I was so anxious to impress Marshall , but there he sat , his hair gleaming from the apartment lights , that school tie , the beautiful way his white hand rose above his head to touch the brick . <p> " I have to go and host , " he said , looking up at his own hand . His neck was thin and half-shadowed as it stretched . <p> I leaned to let the light catch my watch . " But it 's almost midnight . You have to stay just a few minutes . " <p> Marshall brought his face down , but his hand played with the brick . I remember he smiled drunkenly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to be near me when it comes time to kiss . " I chuckled , sounding like my father in my false comfort . <p> " All right , you bastard . " I stood up and felt the chill of the air . I turned towards him , and the light from the apartment 's curtains dotted me . I must have seemed mystical in that pointillism , seen through a filigree . He sat for a moment , then needed a hand getting out of the chair , so I pulled on his wrist . He was very light , and his wrist was adolescently bony , and cool . Marshall was only nineteen . So was I. That was a long time ago . <p> Noises came from the apartment , foolish clacking noisemakers and bells and those shrill plastic horns . All of the cabs on the street began to honk merrily , and a whistling firecracker went off somewhere below . <p> " So I have to go , " he said . But now there was something fierce in the air : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening thing . His pale face became ruddy , fiery at the cheeks . He jammed his lips together . <p> I said the sort of thing we always said : " Well , give Sally a kiss for me , too . " <p> But it was n't the right thing to say . Marshall still stared around him , searching all the tiles of the balcony . He only said , " I will . Tell Britta I 'll marry her . " <p> Laughter came loudly from some men inside , and our singing group began to sing " Auld Lang Syne " in Scottish accents . <p> " I guess we should be inside , " I said . <p> " No , " Marshall said , giving a sudden look , bright and insistent . We stood there for a moment . As he stared , his cheeks burned away in the cold air . I know what the look was now . I suppose I must have appeared the same way . It was : This is the word I 've been searching for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> " Nothing , just let 's not go in just now . " <p> " All right . " I put out my right arm to settle him , touch his sleeve , but it felt ghostly , as if it floated out by itself in the dark light . Marshall must have seen my hand palm-out to him . He grimaced at me and crossed his arms , and I put my hand back in my pocket . Or rather-the hand floated back to my pocket . We were both shaking with an uncertain shame , and shame was such an important part of our upbringings . It must have been that which made me smile , despite all my discomfort . <p> It was the most frightening moment of my life up until then , because somehow I knew neither of us wanted to be in there with our girls . We waited because it seemed someone had something honest and painful to say , but it was not said , so we stood halfshivering , amazed and innocent on that balcony , only nineteen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly in that moment I was loved by someone . <p> And then Britta walked onto the balcony . I turned my whole body away from Marshall to face her . <p> " It 's 1965 , " she said , then waved her hand . " So are you guys going to kiss or what ? " <p> Marshall looked at me and laughed , then nodded and put out his palm . We shook hands-ridiculous-then he left through the glass door . Britta watched his progress through the room , the various stolen kisses I could hear but not see , then she folded her arms and looked at me , shivering . She looked radiantly happy . <p> " What ? " I asked . She shrugged her shoulders . " What ? " <p> I walked forward and kissed her for the first time . We had been dating for a while , but never had I kissed her because Pembroke girls were notorious for anger at such points . And Britta always laughed and turned away whenever we were close enough . She let me kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pulled away , and her face was as angry as I 'd imagined . I thought to myself , You did it wrong again . But she patted my shoulder , as if the anger were about something else entirely . <p> " You 're a puzzle , Mr. Robinson , " she said . <p> " Not really . " <p> " No , " she said , smiling . " Not really . " <p> Britta walked over to the balcony and leaned over the rail , thrusting her head up to catch the new wind . I stood behind her and watched her gold hairdo unravel . <p> I finally pulled out a cigarette and offered one to her . When Britta turned around , I tried to read her mind , but as usual it was impossible . I had dated many girls with wide expressions , but Britta was illegible . She took the cigarette and let me light it in her hand . She looked up into my eyes when she was done with the flame . She would always do that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was a bad thing for the Jabberwocks because Marshall was sick , too , and we were the only tenors who could hit " How High the Moon . " Also , Providence was warm and plush with magnolia at that time of year , and all the Pembroke girls would waltz down Thayer arm in arm , their Bermudas flapping and their capped teeth dazzling each bitter young man they teased . So I lay in my dorm room , my roommate having dropped out a month before and gone back to New York City . I watched the fraternity men throwing footballs and shouting names of girls they loved too much . <p> Britta pounded the door in that way of hers to find me dressing for a Jabberwock cocktail party with the university president . I remember she was all in green lace , a dress and a vest , with a worn , brown leather bag thrown over her shoulder . She kept yelling at me to get back into bed , and when I would n't and stood delirious in front of the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of tea . I drank it all down , and within minutes I was dead asleep on my bed . <p> I woke up hours later to find Britta smearing cold cream on my face and humming faintly . She had tied her hair up and taken off her vest , so she was only in that green lace dress . <p> " Ah , " she said . " You 're alive again . " <p> " God , what happened ? " <p> " Oh , I drugged your tea . " <p> I could n't move , but sat there feeling her rub the cream into my skin . <p> " What ? " I complained faintly . <p> " Do n't move . I 'm cleaning your face . Being sick makes you greasy . " <p> " You mickeyed my tea ? Are you a Communist or something ? " <p> Britta wiped her hands off on a towel and knitted her brow . " I was n't going to let you meet President Keeney feverish and strange , was I ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snickered at that and brought over a box of Kleenex to wipe off the cold cream . My view of her face was blocked by those tissues passing over me like clouds . <p> " How do you knows " I began again , " that I 'm not on some drug which would react strongly to sleeping pills ? " <p> " Do n't be a child , Paul , " she said . " Sit back . I 'm going to give you a dry shampoo now , so do n't move . " <p> " A dry shampoo ? " <p> " You look awful . " Britta brought out a bottle of baby powder and began sprinkling it in her palms . " Besides , " she said , " I want to talk to you about something . " <p> She dangled her fingers above my face , and some powder snowed down on me . Then she slid her hands into my hair , rubbing at my sick scalp and cleaning me all over . I felt utterly helpless and ill , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " what do we have to talk about that you must drug me ? " <p> " I 'm tired of living in the dorms , Paul . " <p> " Yeah , really . " <p> " You are , too , right ? " <p> " Those frat guys drive me crazy with their boozing . " <p> " So we 're both tired of living in the dorms . " <p> " I applied for off-campus permission , " I said , closing my eyes as she stroked my head with powder . It was a lovely feeling . <p> I heard Britta say , " You know that wo n't work . No one gets offcampus permission except married couples . You have to be married . " <p> " Right , " I said . I sat there for a moment , eyes closed , until I realized she was staring at me . I looked up , and she took her hands out of my hair and put them on her lap . She sat very ladylike on my bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , her wide pretty face , the hair slightly wild piled on her head . She was expecting me to be wise at that moment . <p> " Oh , Britta , " I said , " we 've only been dating for a little while . " <p> Then her composure dropped , and she laughed . She got up off my bed and walked to my door . <p> " We have n't been dating , Paul . You kissed me once , half a year ago . " Britta closed the door and locked it . She leaned against it and widened her eyes at me . It almost looked like pity . <p> " What is it , then ? " I demanded . " I spend every waking hour with a girl , and we 're not dating ? And now you want marriage ? " <p> " Paul , " she said , her chin to her chest , " we 're not lovers . We 're beards . " <p> The men playing football began to sing the Brown fight song . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does that mean ? " I asked . The moment was entirely frightening to me . Britta seemed a nightmare creature of my delirium at that second , instead of my best friend . <p> " We 're covers . We 're false lovers , because we ca n't tell anyone who we really love , can we ? " <p> " Who is it ? " I asked , sarcastic and fearful . " Who is that I really love ? " <p> " Paul , I 've met your father , " she said , walking towards me . " He would disown you . I know my father would disown me . They love us , but they 'd kill us before they knew . And then what kind of life would we have ? Not this one . I like this one . " <p> " Who is this secret lover ' of mine ? " <p> " What a relief to just be married like they want . " <p> " You 've got mono , " I said confidently . " You 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sitting on the bed and putting her hand over mine . " Marshall is . You and he have mono together . " <p> I threw her hand from me . I felt nauseated . " What are you saying ? " I said . I raged my fingers through my hair to get the filthy powder out of it . A cloud surrounded me , but Britta did n't laugh this time . She put her finger to her lips and whispered harshly : <p> " I do n't want to talk about it . I have women lovers whom you need never meet nor mention . I 'm not asking to discuss your love life . I 'd rather we never discussed it . I 'm asking for you to listen this once , Paul . " She put her hands on either side of my chest , and a worried look came over her face . " We 're unlucky . People are talking , Paul . Saying I 'm a man , and you 're a pansy . If we make a mistake , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart . And we 're creative . " <p> I said nothing . Powder settled on her dress . <p> I will never understand how Britta knew everything I did or felt . It had only been a few months before , over spring break , that I had gone to Marshall 's house on Long Island . I always did thisthere was no special occasion . His parents were gone , as they usually were when he asked them , and we spent a few days getting cold in walks along the gray beaches . We became more and more silent with each other , and yet I was insistent that we take these walks . There was some kind of tea dance going on at Shelter Island , and that afternoon I suggested we go . I wanted to distract him from whatever was worrying him-I 'm sure I needed distraction , too . There was a faint flurry falling outside , unseasonable , and Marshall had lit a fire . He was proud of the fire . There was something in his father which always made Marshall pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray sweater and , not looking at me , agreed . Then he suggested we arrive roaring drunk . Of course this idea came like a relief . <p> His father had a habit of storing half-drunk martinis in the freezer and forgetting them , so we started with those-there was no other gin in the house . Then we mixed drinks for each other . Not cruelly , though it began that way , but exotically . We made drinks like vodka and creme de menthe , which Marshall held up to his red hair . He knew doing that would make him beautiful . He made me drinks of blue-eyed curacao . Soon it was dark , and we forgot all about the tea dance , perhaps had never really meant to go . <p> I remember watching him talk . I thought it was a trick of my heart . But there , just for a moment in his eyes , his parted lips , I could tell his mind was whirring . I saw the muscles twitch . But really , in the Yankee conversation and polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unordinary instant , and I thought it must have been the colored drinks he kept handing me . <p> Marshall played records for me , songs I did n't quite like thenmodern jazz and odd , foreign classical-but we danced with invisible debutantes . We made false conversation to them , ridiculed them . We practiced shaming them with cool WASP weapons . Then we danced with each other , silent , not touching , and then , of course , wrapped warmly like an old couple near the end of the night . Then our heads tilted back , and I looked at him . Marshall 's face was in a shadow , his stare at me the only bright thing there , but I could hear a tiny noise come from him , a kind of realization-huh-and then he smiled . And then , to make him close his eyes , I kissed him . <p> The bed we awoke in was two hundred years old , and it surprised me that nothing was different in the snowless morning . I began the lover 's doubts : Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turned over as he wakes and he 's looking at me . There , now he 's holding my hand . What does he mean ? I caught his eye as seldom as I could , out of simple fear . And I almost bolted-only because I knew he was not going to leave . <p> " Think about it , Paul , " Britta said to me that day of her proposal . " You 're in trouble now , but this could make things very easy . " <p> I turned away from her , out to the window where the other men beat each other on the back out of laughing brotherhood , which was also a kind of loneliness . <p> " I 'm asking now because I 'm getting scared for us , " she said , getting up and pulling her brown bag off the floor . " And because that yellow house on the hill is for sale . Remember we walked by that house , with the white columns and the widow 's walk ? " <p> There was a knock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child caught burying her allowance . It was a lovely face , serious and innocent . Britta glanced at me and unlocked the door . Two boys from my singing group came in , with a Mason jar of chicken soup and a folder of dirty pictures . They were quiet around Britta , but after she left they told me about the Jabberwock party the night before and produced a note from Marshall , sick a floor below me , a note sealed in an envelope . They showed a boyish awe when I told them I was engaged . <p> Britta and I were married in October , in a small ceremony in Maine . She wore a band of daisies in her hair , and a white ribbon trailed down her back onto the ground . Marshall was my best man . I did not know the woman Britta chose as maid of honor , but she was beautiful and brunette and nice enough . The Jabberwocks sang at the reception , and Britta and I danced to " How High the Moon . " Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spun that grinning , ribboned young woman around the floor . <p> My mother bought us the yellow house on Meeting Street , and when Britta came wide-eyed into my bedroom with a photograph of a divan she 'd cut out of The New Yorker , my mother helped us buy that , too . I still have that divan . The wood is deep yellow , and a sea of striped white silk covers it . We had an upright piano , a Baldwin , and acres of bookcases were built into the walls to house Britta 's collection of foreign books and fairy tales . My bedroom was the " master " bedroom , and my wife slept in the guest bed draped in a ridiculous fall of mosquito netting , which she said made her feel exotic and safe . We were twenty , the same age as my parents when they were married . <p> The arrangements were unspoken but clear . Marshall came over " for dinner " as often as I liked , but he never interfered in the time Britta and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare her to make a dinner from them , and she always took the dare . And her meals were always abysmal . Her frequent lovers came through back stairs and parked in the church lot . I rarely met them except late at night , when I crept downstairs for a book and found Britta and a woman , beautiful and sweet or harsh or distantly intelligent , whispering sincerely over sherry . Britta was never angry to see me . She always pulled her peacocked kimono close around her breast and smiled . <p> Britta often saw ghosts and haunts around this old merchant town , and sometimes sat in her guest bed throwing coins to tell the future of all her friends . She would yell out the fortunes to me , things that never made any sense : " A woman , " I would hear through the wall at night , " crosses from a wide lake to a river , " as if that explained it all . <p> We did n't live through the sixties , not the sixties everyone else seems to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would blow up the Supreme Court for a cause . They were Brown men who despised their parents ' fortunes , wore only Salvation Army brown cotton jackets , but always their gold watches and rings gave them away . We listened to Dave Brubeck and not Charlie Parker , Tom Lehrer instead of Woody Guthrie , because what we sought was cleverness and not sincerity . None of our crowd stormed University Hall , and we watched with only mild interest as more and more colored boys entered our classes . It neither upset nor thrilled us . The change was utterly separate from the lives we had always led . <p> Marshall threw a party in my honor at our graduation in the spring of 1967 . It was in the mansion of an old faggot professor we knew , a mansion down on Benefit Street with its cobblestones and brass horse-rails . A young Portuguese boy had been hired to ensure no champagne glass ever got below halfway full-he crept around handsomely , insistent with his bottle . Soon couples were dancing on the furniture , the Pembroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties of my Jabberwock brothers . Marshall poured half a glass into my hair and messed it around with his hand . His own hair , I remember , was copper and curled from the heat of dancing , smoothed back with sweat as if he were from the thirties . He laughed and looked around for someone else to torment . It pained me that even at my party I could n't simply reach over to this man I loved so achingly and brush an eyelash stuck to his cheek . Too intimate , too kind . He faded off into a crowd . <p> " I saw a ghost in our house , " said my wife beside me . <p> I looked at her , and sadness must have been on my face , because Britta 's smile fell for a moment and she lowered her shining glass . She wore blue-black velvet and luminous false pearl earrings in gold . <p> " You what ? " I asked , breathless . <p> " Are you all right , Paul ? " <p> " You saw a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then took a sip of champagne as a forty-five of the Kingston Trio came on to boos and hisses . " In our house . It was a man . <p> " Were you scared ? " <p> " Would you ask that if it were a woman ? No . It was a very old man , very tired , I think . " <p> " Did he say anything ? Where was this ? " <p> " In the kitchen . Just before we came . He did n't say anything , " Britta said , putting her hand to her chest . " He stood there confused as if it were an accident , the wrong house , maybe the wrong life to interrupt , and he stared at me not knowing what he was supposed to be doing . " <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I stared at him the same way . . . I think . . . and then he was gone . " <p> Britta looked at me , thinking to herself . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me regretfully , flashing her marriage band , then giving a vampire face meant , I suppose , to scare me back into the party . I was thinking about other things , too drunk to separate the petty from the profound . <p> Marshall was caught up in this graduation . I think he was obsessively worried about his life after this , giving up all this to work for his father , or , perhaps worse , to go to law school . And maybe he was afraid I 'd move away-I still do n't know . But something made him shake me away when I grabbed his arm and whispered for him to be quiet-he was saying uncharacteristic things to young men . His glare was n't just anger-he was sad , maybe disappointed in something , maybe in me . <p> The party went on all night in that old merchant house . I remember that the walls were striped with gold paper and that iron sconces lit up faces with flattering candlelight and shadow . Otherwise , the evening passed as many other evenings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us secure in futures there and in wives . I passed out in a dining room chair , and awoke to someone telling me the baritone had kindly driven my wife home to bed . Britta was famous for never saying goodbye . I fell back to sleep with those walls of gold stripes papering my dreams . <p> In the morning , I was on the Oriental rug . I got up to go to the bathroom , and felt the left side of my face was ragged and burned from the carpet I 'd slept on . I saw others asleep and drugged on couches , their jackets or wraps thrown over them by someone kind and sober , the sun reaching over them to light the paintings framed on the walls , all of willow trees . Outside , a radio was playing " Aura Lee . " I climbed up the spiral stairs to the bathroom , but there was someone inside coughing . I thought maybe I 'd try one in the master suite-the professor had already left , and the door was half-open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk covers lay my lover , Marshall , and the Portuguese boy , drunk and dead asleep , shirtless and embracing with a harem of embroidered pillows fallen around them . I remember them well . I remember most of all how sweet they looked , how honest , really . Though he was a liar to me , my lover seemed so poignant with that dark boy clutched to him , as if they comforted each other the way young boys do when they have lost a thing together . I leaned heavily against the door and watched the room for a while . The light came in through sheer white curtains , slow as a tide . All around the ceiling , urns with wreaths were stenciled , and above the bed a blue cherub holding a bird . A common bird : a sparrow . <p> I remember the only thought that went through my head as I walked home in my rumpled evening clothes : I have no claim on him . No one knew I loved him . I assumed no one ever would , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house that morning , I called out Britta 's name , and no one answered . The wooden floors glowed yellow with the May sun , and all the glass door handles sparked with light as if electric or releasing secrets . Perfume from some early morning bath still hung in the air-eucalyptus , I remember-and it scented the cold white walls , the framed maps of Maine and Rhode Island , made them intriguing , as if they trapped inside their surfaces unimaginable gardens . I remember it , of course , as beautiful and strange , and yet I am sure it is only memory because I know I slumped into an armchair and began to cry . <p> I do n't know when I had ever cried before that , not since grade school , certainly , rarely in front of anyone and never in front of my father , but all alone in that warm wooden room , I wept , and because I was so out of practice , I wept loudly and badly . I panted and held my face to stop the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needed no convincing , spitting long jeweled strands of saliva onto my lap as I bent over . My jaw shook , humiliated . The sounds I made were ghastly , but this was too much pain . I could not bear it . So I sat there childishly blubbering into the fabric , lost and generous at last with my pain , shipwrecking myself over and over against my old memory of love . <p> I felt my wife 's hand against my shoulder . I was not alone at all . I could not look up , so ashamed with this fit , coughing up the tears . I was so ashamed Britta should see me prone over a redhaired dilettante . I leaned more into the nubbed pink fabric . I turned away . She should never see me like this , never , not this friend . But I felt her other hand against my arm , and then her cold face beside mine . She did not hold me but floated next to me , silent . We said nothing , and never spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wet face and that smell of eucalyptus strong again , I knew there was a part of me , the greater part , which would endure . <p> We lived on Meeting Street long after graduation . In 1972 , I was still working at the Brown Alumni Center . It was good enough , and Britta went back to school so she could open up a psychology practice . I heard Marshall went to Boston to work for his father for a while , but after a year he came back to Providence , bought a house near ours . A pink house-it showed how much he needed to be near , that he would buy a pink house . I know now he planned his day to run into me , just catch my eye outside the center , and after a while I spoke cordially to him . In those conversations he was confident , talking about law school at what we considered a lesser college in the area , applying to a better school , by which he meant a better name . And one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was bright around his face . I remember it made Marshall the focus of the air , with sky bent to his eyes like that eerie creme de menthe the night I kissed him . <p> And Britta had taken a more steady lover , a French woman named Nathalie who worked as a designer . I will admit I never liked her much . She was very quiet . She had a habit of sitting and listening to Britta and me jabber away , just sitting with the pink tip of her tongue sticking out between her lips , the way you see older cats do . But Britta loved something about her . I heard my wife laughing in her bedroom when Nathalie came over , but never saw this part of her lover myself . When Nathalie cooked her sacred cassoulets , Britta watched her from the kitchen doorway with a rapt , patient gaze , as if her lover were a book she read for pleasure . We never know what friends see in their lovers . We always expect they will see what they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hate in friends ' lovers is a hoard of private moments we thought we would inherit . <p> She left Britta after some years . I forgot to say she was a married woman , and she decided it was her husband she really loved . Britta and I never spoke of it , but about a week afterwards , I took her to Boston to see her favorite place : the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . The idea of visiting an old dead woman 's house just to see her paintings and her giant pink courtyard made me queasy , but I went for Britta . Marshall , visiting Harvard Law , joined us at the blunt medieval entrance . Britta said she wanted to see one particular painting , " The Birth of Athena , " and we toured the balconied , decorated corridors until we came into a red silk room , silver chalices against the window catching sun , paintings all around us in leafy gilt frames , hung with wires from the molding , every one on them entitled " The Birth of Athena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hands clasped . Then she pinched her lips together and looked at me and Marshall wideeyed . I think her loudness made me furious . That must have amused her even more , because she walked up to one of the paintings , dark foliage with a gleaming white god clutching his head . <p> " Now here , " she said seriously , " here we have a Grecian forest , and what 's happening is there 's this crack in Zeus 's skull , and who pops out of it is Athena . " Britta walked to a painting next to it , bright green . <p> " This one 's a little different , " she said , considering it . " This one 's about Athena popping out of Zeus 's skull . " <p> Then Marshall burst out in high laughter . I turned , surprised . Marshall was not one to laugh in public places , and I saw for really the first time that Britta and Marshall knew something I did n't . My lover pointed to a cartoon below the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " because it 's very unique . It 's about this skull , you see . " <p> " Is it Zeus 's ? " she asked . <p> " And Athena pops out . " <p> They snickered together , and a gold-buttoned guard came over . I turned away , delighted but ashamed to cause a scene in such a sacred place : a home , and a museum . The guard made us move along into the courtyard , my wife and lover arm in arm , unable to stop laughing at a joke I did n't quite understand . Britta wore a black jumpsuit and a wide black straw hat , which she held to her head as they strode past the yellow roses . There was a blueberry bush , and Marshall stood still as Britta moved slowly toward it . I do n't know why he stopped-maybe he knew to let her walk on . <p> He did not look back at me . It was not our moment together watching her . It was his moment , seeing in her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of after years seeing her with her occult necklaces , batting at the mosquito netting of her bed , and giggling as if love could not be squandered . <p> So we watched her walk into the blueberries . A tulip tree shaded her there , and she stood inside that shadow , turning slowly and taking in the peeling pink on the museum 's walls . I admired her , absorbed in the circle she was creating as slowly as a blackeyed Susan might spread its petals . The crowd around us was giddy with noise , but the main sound I remember was the clicking of her shoes and the buzzing of the heat that day . <p> I walked over to her . Marshall finally looked at me . I caught his eye , and he seemed to be examining me , the black-haired man , and not critically . As if I 'd shown him some new talent in marrying such a woman . <p> " You all right ? " I asked my wife when I reached her . <p> She stopped at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth which I knew was her fake one , though it was beautiful . <p> " Why ? Yes . " <p> " You want to leave ? " <p> She sounded oddly relieved . She took off her hat and looked up into that one tulip tree in this city museum . " No , this is nice . I was just thinking . " Britta picked a berry off the bush and put it in her mouth . She quickly removed it and made a face . " These blueberries are terrible ! " <p> " They 're still green , darling . " <p> She glared at the tiny fruit in her hand , then threw it away and blinked at me . " So they are , darling . " <p> Marshall came up behind me . He put his hand in my coat pocket . It was one of our secret signs of intimacy , as if he were searching my coat , when really it meant : Here I am . <p> " She loved you , Britta , " was what he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know he saw those things in people . <p> " No , " she said . " You can only love one at a time . Apparently it 's a rule . Like in chess . " <p> " Britta , ' I tried , " Nathalie was n't really right , and you know . . " <p> She put her hat back on and interrupted , " No , it 's fine . It 's not a big deal , really . Let 's go back and see the dungeon : ' She flicked a smile and walked past me and my lover into the sunlight . <p> " Britta . . " <p> She turned around and faced us , faced me , both hands holding her hat against the wind . Her mouth broke down right then , just snapped in two like a twig . We all simply stood there , and she shuddered . I watched her pain pooling out into her face , her shaking hand moving to wipe her cheek , and she stared at me with the fear we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she held me , smelling of eucalyptus , on another bright , sad day . <p> " Here 's something I want , " she said , moving her head from Marshall to me . " If we never see each other again , we should still all meet every year right here , " she said , tapping the table , " in the courtyard . " <p> " No , " Marshall said , glancing at me , " in the Birth of Athena ' room . " <p> Britta laughed and said , " Oh , yes , yes . But they only hang the paintings on off-years , so every other year , then . " <p> " When ? " I asked at last . <p> " Today , " Britta said , raising her eyebrows , " on your birthday , darling . " <p> " But we 're not going anywhere , Britta . We see each other every day . " <p> She put her hands out in honesty , and the hat got away from her . I ran out after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow roses . I pulled it from the thorns , and Britta was laughing to Marshall again , arms tight around herself , eyes closed , face sideways to the light , which made her golden , valuable , alone . <p> Every two years we still met at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . We did not go all together , of course . We pretended for that day ( my birthday ) we had lost each other in the span of years , the three of us who knew each other so well , we could imitate any of our laughs , and each loitered in the " Birth of Athena " room , staring benignly at a painting until someone finally recognized another and screamed their name aloud in delight ( Britta recognizing Marshall the first time , Marshall seeing me the next ) . Then there would be more screams as I joined in the reunion , and for all the guards knew , it was really the most astounding coincidence . <p> And so it went for years . Those ridiculous meetings in the museum marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alumni Center , which brought more and more of the same , well-broughtup men and , in 1975 , women through my doors . I barely noticed the changes at Brown , either , except the one time a rally walked by my window . In that old brownstone building , the windows were drooping glass , so at first I could n't make out the words on their signs . Then I saw one in pink : " Gay Is Good . " I sat immediately back at my desk , looking to make sure my door was closed . I felt I had witnessed an obscene act , a prurient display shown to me without my wish or consent . I felt breathless and ill , and put my head on the desk . They were chanting something , too , which , luckily , the paneled walls muffled into a harmless rhythm . I concentrated then on that rhythm and tried to breathe along with it , get myself back to the man I had been five minutes before , and not until the sounds passed down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regained myself . <p> That was 1977 . It was the year Marshall moved to Boston . He was finishing Harvard now , and had no time for Providence commutes . Instead , he or I drove to the other city on weekends , or met together on Cape Cod or Mystic at the Aquarium . These visits also meant my time with Britta was separate from my time with Marshall . My lover and I took more cold , stony walks on beaches . He was growing more serious as years went on . His father was already dead , and I saw something tempting him . It was not another man-that was past-but the temptation to tell his mother about me , his male lover , and let all this fall to rest . We never spoke of it , but I tried with every clench of his hand not to change things . I liked things as they were . I still like most things as they are-my father taught me this adaptability , this cowardice . <p> A hurricane came that year to the East Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female hurricane . Britta and I were bored with it at first . It distressed the routines we had developed , and I see we were turning slowly into those practical adults who hated the snow because of driving , hated staying out at night because it was hard to see in the dim light , hated most disturbances that were no longer new . So we hated taping up all the windows and pulling the shutters . She was particularly grouchy in the matronly , quilted robe my mother had bought her . But then , when Britta found a hurricane lamp and lit it , and the soot blew out and blackened her face , we laughed as we had as college kids . <p> I asked , " What is this , minstrel hour suddenly ? " " You are a racist , darling . " <p> The lights flickered . " Clean yourself up . We have to get a fire going , or do you just want to go to sleep ? " <p> Her eyes widened in shock . " Oh , no ! Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to stay up all night tonight , on a hurricane night . " <p> I said we should read to each other . Usually she liked that . She shook her head . <p> " No . We 're going to do what I want to do . This is n't Marshall you 're with tonight . We do n't have to arm wrestle to have a good time . You 're a gay man , after all , no matter what you think : ' <p> She took me upstairs to her room and gave me her peacock kimono . She told me to strip down and put it on while she washed off the soot . She walked out of the room with the lantern , and I was left with just my dim candle there , in her room with Chinese coins strung along the mirror , striped masks on the walls . I stripped naked and put on her girlish robe . Marshall hated robes and girlish things on me . Shame , again , always that . <p> Britta came back , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I realized it was n't a nightgown . It was her wedding dress . She put her hand to her mouth , then held it out as if to stop me . " Perfect , " she said . " You look perfect . Now , just follow me . " She grabbed a bag and a book from her dresser and blinked her glassy eyes for me to come . <p> Down at the fire , she made me rub sage oil in my hair and tie it up with a towel-I must have looked like a faggot then , but I was letting her control me that night . I made her wear her blue clay mask , and so we were both ridiculous . She was letting me see at last the kind of life we would have led if our hearts had been otherwise . <p> We read messages from a plastic Ouija board she had , and she swore she was n't cheating when it spelled out names of men I 'd had crushes on long , long before . Men who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages professed undying passion . They told of my innocence . Britta , or I could believe some ghost she found , told me stories I needed about myself . <p> She threw my I Ching . She told me a narrow river opened onto a lake , that I would cross the dam onto an open space . Her own fortune involved a girl with a package , and she read its meaning secretly to herself . She sat cross-legged before the fire . I could see more of her body than I ever had . She was gaining weight . But there was something newly compassionate in her larger body , the way her breasts now rested on her skin-I could see them beneath the thin fabric when she threw the fiery copper coins . I wonder what my older body looked like to her . Sometimes I wonder if she was in love with me . <p> She slept in my bed that night . It was in the corner of the house , safe from the hurricane . The lamp was on all night , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been off for all the darkness in the room . Once , I woke up , and the kimono had come undone-I lay naked on my half of the bed , and she was turned towards the wall , so I let the green night glow over me and imagined this was marriage , this was love , and the person asleep , smelling of sage oil , was a lipsticked man in silk . A man who knew me naked , green in the night , listening . And that all this was perfect . <p> In 1980 , a friend got me a job offer in the Alumni Center at Harvard . I had n't even told Britta that I was looking around , and at the time I told myself I was n't serious , anyway , so I need n't get her involved . But I told Marshall . Marshall knew about every step , every college I talked to in Boston . I think he knew what would happen , even then . Living in a larger city , a liberal one , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freed him after his mother died and that allowed him to live without pretense . And he changed . People at his law firm knew about our relationship , relatives , old friends . It was 1980 , a unique moment in America . Those years in the late seventies when I was searching , he must have smiled to himself , thinking of my old-fashioned , ridiculous situation . <p> I finally talked to Britta in the fall , a rainy late afternoon . She was home from her practice and lay on the white divan , reading Harper 's and eating potato chips from a garish bag . A white candle lay flickering next to her . Her hair was still feathered blond , but lighter at the temples , as if faded from so many years in sun . We were thirty-six . <p> " Honey , " I said , sitting down in the armchair , " I have a great job offer . " <p> She looked up , her face wide open . " Really ? Oh , that 's fantastic ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip in her mouth , and it crackled . <p> " It 's in Boston : ' <p> Her face considered this . She ate more chips . " That 's fine . I 'm bored of this place , really . We should have packed our bags years ago , and . . . , " she said , pointing her finger , " you 'll be closer to Marshall . This is perfect . " <p> " Marshall wants me to live with him . " <p> She closed her eyes and rubbed a finger over the lids , perhaps to be more awake . " Oh , " she said as she did this . " So that 's what this about . " <p> " I was shocked , " I said . " I did n't want to , I do n't want to , but there 's this part of me . . <p> " That really does . I know , Paul . " <p> " And it 's bigger than I thought . " I leaned over and held my hands loosely together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , wanting to skip past the next impossible sentence : " Maybe it 's time . " <p> She put her hand to her mouth , which was a movement I could not read . She wiped the crumbs from her navy skirt . <p> " It is time , " she said . <p> I waited , saying nothing . <p> " We both knew this was to make life easier . And now it 's silly , is n't it ? " She nodded , agreeing with herself . " Being married ? Is n't it ? " <p> I could n't nod , but I did smile . <p> She kept talking . These were not the exact words we said to each other that afternoon-my memory is never perfect . I do n't usually remember her in quotations , anyway . What I remember is how we talked in this way , all that afternoon , as if it were a cocktail party we were canceling and not a life . <p> So she said , " Now I have to come up with something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing . We 've been stuck . " <p> " We have been , " I said . <p> " Being stuck is comforting , is n't it ? " <p> And I know I did n't feel that way at all . I was forcing myself to be sad and serious , but inside me I was thrilled to live with Marshall and change my life . I am ashamed to say I wanted Britta to smile and pack her things , to come up with something which would make this dull conversation end , so I said a common thing : " It 's been wonderful . " <p> She sat with her hand on her chin , looking up at the ceiling . She had long ago grown her real eyebrows in , and they were dark and thin . Her neck was half-shadowed , just like Marshall 's on that night on Beacon Hill when none of us knew what our playful facades would make of our lives . <p> " It is time , " she repeated , as if trying it on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What are you going to do ? " <p> " Well , " she said quietly . " I think once I wanted to live on an island . Did n't I ? Was n't there an island ? What was that ? " <p> Now she did make me laugh-it could have been relief . " You said you wanted to be a gilded white scorpion . " <p> " Really ? " she asked , staring grinning at me . " A scorpion ? Right , be a wicked woman on a Caribbean island . Would n't that be something ? " My wife looked at me and I could almost imagine it . <p> Later , she told me firmly , " But this is lucky . This is very lucky . " <p> These were the kinds of things we said . But I ca n't picture us saying them . All I see is my wife talking in that dim , streaked light , leaning into the cushions and-I 'm sure she did n't know she did this-drawing on her forehead with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was n't what I wanted , but sketching those invisible pictures on her skin . What I remember best is that . Not much , just that . <p> It only took Britta a month to pack what she wanted , which was n't much . She quickly closed her practice and sent her clients to a friend , wrapped up the paintings she loved , only three , her clothes , some jewelry . I walked behind her , begging her to take things , but she told me , " Anyone who ca n't fit her life into two suitcases is stuck forever . " <p> The day she left , I remember she took a long shower , and I tried to shove things into the crevices of her bags : my grandfather 's pocket watch , my mother 's diamond ring , a first edition Dorothy Parker . I wanted to give it all to her because I felt she was hiding behind this adventure , escaping the grief at my selfish act . I was so guilty at the thought of being happy up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over whose china got put in the cabinet . But she must have known-there is n't much to do with friends who leave . Just these rituals of packing , but you ca n't say anything to keep him there . You can only repeat that once you drugged his tea . <p> My wife , Britta , came out of her room in her traveling clothes : black dress , red jacket , and , over her arm , the trenchcoat she claimed had always saved her . The hollow Celtic necklace lay around her throat , jingling hope , and she walked to me as she pulled on a silver bracelet . <p> " I 'll send you a card from the island when I get there , " she said confidently . " I think the phone 's too expensive . Then you 'll write to me . " <p> " Of course I will , " I said . " Are you crazy ? Of course . " <p> " And " she said , then let out a sharp laugh , " will you and Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You still want to do that ? " <p> She pouted and shook her wrist to let the bracelet settle . " Anyway , I 'll be there . " <p> " Then I 'll be there . " <p> Britta started to put the trenchcoat on . Frost was on the windows that morning , and the last leaves on the maple tree looked frozen , thick as wax . <p> " I saw a ghost last night , " she told me , one arm in the coat . " I think it must have been the maid or the governess . She was in the attic-what was I doing in the attic at that hour , even I do n't know-and all green . A green ghost , can you imagine ? I watched her for a little while , picking up invisible things and putting them back down , things that must have been here a long time ago . It was fun figuring out what they were , like I think one was a humidor . " She looked down to pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive . " She was afraid she 'd forgotten something . Afraid she 'd left something important behind . " I caught her calm look in the mirror . <p> I heard a horn outside , and the cab was there . <p> " Oh ! " she said , frantically picking up leather bags with too many straps . " Case in point ! I left my lipstick in the upstairs bathroom ! I need it , I ca n't live without it . Put me on a desert island , and I 'd trade the two books I brought for lipstick . " <p> I put up one finger , then ran out and up the staircase , which creaked at each pounding step . On the sink was a gold tube of that garish red which had embarrassed me for years , the red of dirty stories and her Dutch island and of the silk-lined museum room . I ran downstairs with it and saw the bags were gone . <p> I glimpsed out the window just a tumble of trenchcoat into the cab , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britta , once again , no goodbye . <p> Today in the courtyard , as I wish myself a happy fortieth birthday , as I stare at the green blueberries , I know Britta might not be coming . It 's been hard to contact her for two years now . She did go to Saint Eustatius , and she bought land there from an old dying man . She wrote lots of letters then , all about the insane things she saw there , the governor who was a tyrant , the rich white people on the hill hoarding a pile of wood , which on the island was like gold , her travails building a house of gingerbread and jalousies . <p> Marshall and I did n't show up here in 1982 . There was so much going on at the time : living together became sometimes more unspoken hostility than love , and I changed jobs to MIT and had to go home to my father 's funeral . That birthday passed unnoticed . Marshall still lives on Beacon Hill , and I now live south of there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on the street-but I know his fright at middle age has brought other men into our old apartment . And the notes from Britta have been brief , businesslike . <p> That morning when she left our yellow house on Meeting Street , I walked outside in the October cold and saw the cab drive off , watched long after as the sun began to rise and make the brittle ice on the lilac bush glitter and break off . I sat down on that square wood porch , beneath the peeling columns , and could not think of anything to think . I 'd given everything away and not even seen it . All the week before , I had been eager as a boy , excited to move up to Boston , experience the warm change my life would make , and never realized what I thought had weighed me down was simply love . I had sent away the one person I really loved , and made myself think it was a kind of freedom , and now I saw the empty space this freedom revealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before , and there was no excuse this time for ugliness . I did n't coax the tears with self-pity or remembrance ; they just filled me . A little boy wearing a birthday hat walked by , and he stared at me weeping with no consolation now . I thought he might give me the shining present he held , but he gripped it tighter and moved on . All my muscles gnawed at me and shook . I became angry with my body for betraying me , and I gritted my teeth as I trembled with more tears . <p> It did no good . So I let go . My hands fell to the cold white wood , and I let go , and the pain of losing all those years moved over me like a warm sun . <p> The courtyard here is skylit and warm , because it is spring , and damask roses , century plants , and palm trees grow here in their careful rows . All the rooms look onto this courtyard , and I 'm searching one Moroccan window for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards in perhaps white island cotton robes , or a gold-threaded turban . She wears a hollow silver necklace and a kind of brave compassion . You 'll recognize her laugh . <p> There 's a red jacket leaning to the window . It begins a loud , annoying tapping noise against the ancient glass until a goldbuttoned man takes her arm and mouths irritation . A flash goes off nearby-someone taking a picture-and the guard leaves her again . The red jacket returns , slides open the lock , and swings out the window with a snow of black paint . I jump up at my wife 's laughing face , and thank God , thank God . <p>
