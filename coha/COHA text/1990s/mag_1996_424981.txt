HE HAS A NIGHTMARE THAT HE SHARES  --  finally . It 's his own scenario of hell , an ugly vision that plays in the dark , swampy part of his mind . We are drinking many cups of tea  --  first Earl Grey for stimulation , then chamomile for calming down  --  and sitting in a golden little corner of the Four Seasons Hotel in beverly Hills , a place of sunlight , poolside deals , and overly fancy motorcars with movie stars getting out . Steve Martin is loose and relaxed , fresh from an appointment with his therapist . There is nothing overly fancy about him . He is wearing a navy-blue knit sweater . Reading glasses hang on a cord around his neck . " I feel like I 'm in an interim period , " he says , " and I 'm fifty . " I begin to worry . " This is my last viable decade , " he says . And I worry some more . The lonely-death scenario . The pathetic old L.A.-guy scenario . I could feel it ocming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , money , respect , freedom , fame , a brilliant art collection , a cast of loyal old friends and discreet young girlfriends . But something 's troubling him . He can see the future , as though it we one of his paintings on a wall before him . It is a vision of hell , as complicated and horrifying as one by Hieronymus Bosch . As empty as an Edward Hopper , as self-absorbed as a late Rembrandt . In this downbeat scenario , is ten years hence : Martin is turning sixty . By then , presumably , he will have thirty-five middlebrow family hits in the can and might be starring in Father of the Bride VI . But worse than all that , far , far worse : He is getting another divorce . Another bitter divrce . But this time , he has a three-year-old child living in some other part of the city . He can see it vidly , he says . Watching his friends Lorne Michaels and Paul Simon remarry and start new families must cause even more anguish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then something could go terribly wrong  --  or even a little wrong . Love , as he has been learning lately , is an idiotic , unpredictable thing . " I do n't want that . I do n't want that , " he says . In his mind 's eye , the nightmare is materializing . " It 's different when you 're twenty or thirty , " he says . " I mean , it 's still painful . But there 's something horrible about it happening at sixty . So the next relationship has to be it . And I have to make sure it 's really , really right . " What to do ? The following describes Steve Martin 's multistep plan of self-renewal  --  the grand overhaul and full embrace of a midlife crisis  --  divined by me over several weeks of interviews , E-mails , and talks with friends . For the past year , every brain cell has been firing as he has contemplated the nature of romance . The whole man-woman thing . He seems desperate to figure it out  --  before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what it means to be a bachelor , " he says . " Is this what I want ? It 's possible , you know , that I could never meet someone . " STEP NUMBER ONE : KNOW THAT YOU DO N'T KNOW In the mornings , Martin rides his bike around the canyons of L. A. Afternoons , he 's at home  --  as we are now  --  in the new house he moved into a year ago . What does he do all day long ? " I do n't do anything , " he says seriously , and mock seriously , and a little sadly . " I sit around and read and answer the phone . " He is trying not to be a phony . And , indeed , Martin seems to have no routine in private . He is the most unactorish of performers . The phone rings . " I ca n't talk , " he whispers , but seriously . " I 'm doing an in-ter-view . Can I call you back ? " He brings a tray into the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he sets it down seems earnest , deliberate , a little clownish , but it would be wrong to laugh . He builds a fire in the fireplace , with great purposeness  --  it 's 70 degrees outside  --  and sinks into a big white armchair , his back to the roaring blaze . His face beads up with sweat ; he takes off his sweater  --  the same one he wore yesterday at tea . He begins to talk about things of interest to him . What would those be ? The nuances of human behavior.and big landscapes  --  love , death , aging . He has a terrific need to figure things out . And unlike most artists , he is an intense listener . He leans forward , as though English were n't his first language , as though he needed to breathe your words through the pores of his skin , and his face locks into an all-absorbing gaze . " What were you saying about men when they turn forty ? " he asks . " You suggested something . What happens to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask abour his career or his art collection  --  Hoppers , Picassos , Diebenkorns  --  and he will answer you dutifully . But when the conversation shifts back to what 's been on his obsessive , hungry mind , he comes alive . Before going into show business , he wanted to be a philosophy professor , so exploratory thinking suits him . " I 've had these incredible revelations latey on how completely stupid I'v been  --  in terms of relationships with women , " he says . " And now I 've dated a few women , and I 've talked with them abut it . It 's like women have a network of knowledge . Things only women know and men do n't . It 's kept from men , and it works every time . " Pondering the vagaries oflove seems to have opened his mind , let new things pour in . " It 's kept from them because we 're so stupid about it , " he continues  --  and he 's talking about the manipulations , the games , the little numbers that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it 's actually happening .... Some women I 've dated do n't have it at all  --  do n't even knw how to do it . Others know about it , used to do it , do n't do it anymore . Others do n't even know they have it and do it , like , endlessly . Am I sounding macho ? " STEP NUMBER TWO : GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO FALL APART Upon meeting him at the Four Seasons , I was surprised by his candor , his immediate ability to dive into an intimate conversation . A number ofpeople , friends of friends of his , had said that he was tough to talk to and uncomfortable with strangers . " He can be positively monosyllabic , " one person told me . Another described him as " socially autistic . " " He 's almost rude , " said another . " No , he is rude . " Was it possible that had changed ? And so quickly ? " He has become more open , " explains close friend Nora Ephron , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . " He talked quite easily about his divorce from actress Victoria Tennant in 1993 and told me how his heart had been broken next by a younger woman . The last two years have been " traumatic , " he said . He 'd obviously been thrown , headlong , into a period of interspection and regeneration . But rather than finding myself pleased  --  or relieved  --  I was growing a little troubled , particularly since Martin began discussing what he 'd been reading lately . He was , after all , a certified intellectual , as entertainers go , the man who defined postmodern comedy and influenced a generation of stand-up performers . " A phehomenon , " as Lorne Michaels put it . Now , overwhelmed by sadness and a midlife crisis in full throttle , he 'd been reduced to modish psychology cures  --  and sitting in a corner of a Beverly Hills hotel and telling me about it . " I am not a depressed person , " Martin says , " but I was pretty gloomy for about a year . I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sublime . From the simple to the very sophisticated . I was in the bookstore , and I was searching the shelves , like "  --  and he makes a sorrowful , pained look  --  " I need heeeelp . And I saw this little book : How to Survive the Loss of a Love . I go , okay . So I picked up some other books on the subject , all too embarrassing to talk about . And I read this book , and it 's , like , soooo fundamental . It 's got big paragraphs in bold and poems . I was , like , surrre . But it spoke directly to the issue . You know , it 's like very corny movies make people cry , because they are right on . What we 're thinking and feeling is usually not very sophisticated .... " Here 's how naive and stupid I was , " he says . " This little book taught me something so fundamental . Having the pain is what heals you . " This list continued as my jaw descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obsessive Love , and he says , " I picked it up and went , This is not for me , and then , when I read it , I realized it was . " There were Getting the Love You Want and Care of the Soul , both of which he loved , and The Drama of the Gifted Child  --  " I reeeeally related , " he says . Then , while discussing Men Are from Mars , Women Are from Venus , he became excited . " It was soooo revelatory , I could n't believe it It 's written in a very simplistic , pop way , but it 's something I would never have dreamed up on my own  --  or figured out in my entire life " STEP NUMBER THREE : BUY A DOG Unlike his old house , which was famously cold and spare and modern and a shrine to his art collection , his new place , a spectacularly comfortable , rambling ranch house , is decorated warmly , in a tasteful California old-Wasp hacienda style . There was no wall space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his things in storage and sold others . Now only a handful of understated masterpieces dot the walls . Each room looks out on a courtyard with a swimming pool and a garden . And Roger . Before Roger . After Roger . This might be how the world will someday think of Steve Martin  --  for Roger 's mere presence says as much as anything else . Roger is a yellow Labrador retriever and Martin 's only regular companion these days  --  aside from Lucy and Bub , the two cats . He 's a year old . Right now , Roger is outside a glass door and looking in , sort of smearing his nose around . He wants in . But after he wants in , he wants out . He is a lucky dog , because he keeps getting what he wants . He has a very wry , deadpan expression . Especially when being yelled at . " Roger " Roger " I 'm sorry to shout , " Martin says , " but I 've been instructed to be firm with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be firm . Roger is running the show . Roger just exists . Steve thinks a lot about existence and relationships , including his relationship with Roger . Roger is warm , friendly , outgoing . He likes everybody he meets and wags his tail and shimmies his back end . Martin , while he 's thinking so much these days , might be thinking he should be like Roger . STEP NUMBER FOUR : REMEMBER , YOU HAVE FRIENDS He may have flawless comedic timing and great theatrical courage  --  he once roller-skated in a King Tut outfit on The Tonight Show  --  but now Martin seems vulnerable , innocent . " I have a giant dumb area of my brain , " he says . And a little lovelorn . He wants to be alone now , he says . He goes down the hall to fetch a paper . He has printed out some E-mail exchanges with Ephron . He stands behind me and reads one dated December 23 , 1995 : " I think it 's wonderful that you now are trying to be alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself for being alone . " " I 'm not seeing any one person now in a permanent way , " he says . " I 'm seeing some people I like a lot and have really nice relationships with . It 's a very tricky thing because you do n't want to get too close , and yet you have to get a little close or it 's no fun . " Yes , you have to get a little close or it 's no fun at all . A movie star has to make his own way , just like any other lonely single guy , I guess , the only difference being that Steve Martin is Steve Martin . Although this can be a problem , too . His friends have worried that his inability to make chit-chat with strangers could hamper his chances for happiness . He went out to dinner recently with his close friend Brian Grazer  --  who has produced three of Martin 's movies , including his most recent comedy , Sgt. Bilko  --  and Grazer 's girlfriend , Gigi Levangie . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Grazer . " And I said later , " Steve , why ca n't you do that on a date ? ' " I just ca n't , " he said . " Grazer is just one of the many people Martin has to call upon for assistance and wisdom  --  so even when he 's alone , he 's not that alone . People like Martin Short , Kevin Kline , Tom Hanks , Lorne Michaels , and Mike Nichols are close friends , as well as a cast of accomplished women in his age range : Ephron , painter Jennifer Bartlett , and novelist Susanna Moore . And when they are n't kibitzing on the sidelines , they seem determined to find the right woman for him . " There 's a perception of Steve that he 's this awkward , whispering , Andy Warhol , monosyllabic character , " says Short . " I think he 's very normal and healthy . " " He 's very forthcoming about his relationships with women and very , very curious about getting it right , " says Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical-American , expedient , logical side . And he has confidence that if he talks to people and thinks about it and reads about it , and if he 's honest with himself and works hard , he can find true love . " STEP NUMBER FIVE : EXAMINE THE PAST He was born in Waco , Texas . He moved to California when he was five . His father never made it as an actor and sold real estate . The family lived in Garden Grove , California . They were n't a warm bunch . ( See his play WASP . ) Long silences at dinner . Young Steve worked at Disneyland , selling guidebooks . Did magic tricks at birthday parties . Painfully shy . Studied philosophy at Long Beach State , then UCLA . Left school to write for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . Won an Emmy . Left comedy writing to perform . Was n't dark and obscene like Lenny Bruce . Had some rough , lean years . Wore a white suit and played the banjo . Made animals out of long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEP NUMBER SIX : OPEN YOUR HEART Roger is scratching at the door again . He wants out . Forget women 's special knowledge . " Roger " the comedian shouts . The low , booming baritone Martin uses is a total act  --  his worst performance  --  and Roger knows this . His ears prick up at the sight of a bird swooping into the backyard . He whines and barks once . " Roger " Roger looks over at the comedian and stares at him a little coolly . " I 'm sorry about this , " Martin says , " but I think I need to let him out . " STEP NUMBER SEVEN : QUIT TRYING SO HARD Martin has a reputation in Hollywood for hard work and discipline , for generosity with other performers , for loyalty . He has made many movies with Carl Reiner , for instance , even though it 's clear that Reiner is no Kurosawa . But he also moves on , regenerates , has n't stayed satisfied with one genre  --  or one routine . After he got into movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from making edgy , original comedies like The Jerk , Dead Men Do n't Wear Plaid , and Pennies from Heaven to taking on more serious acting roles , such as the ones in Parenthood and Leap of Faith , and to writing screenplays  --  the brilliantly sweet Roxanne and L.A. Story  --  while keeping up regular appearances on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live and coming up with new stage acts , too  --  like " The Great Flydini "  --  and , in the last five years , writing plays on the side . " First , you work hard to prove you are n't a flash in the pan , " Martin says . " Then you work to show other things you can do . And you write to show something else . It 's showing and showing and showing . And pretty soon , you realize there 's a kind of emptiness left , and it 's traumatic .... And I realized that unless I was continually working , I felt people would n't like me . " You did n't exist if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he says . " Something embarrasses me about that . I ca n't stand that . My own reason is just as embarrassing , but it 's different .... It 's , like , only in the last couple of years did I discover that I had anything to say . And before that , I was running on a sort of comedy energy  --  and the love of comedy . Comedy alone was enough . " And then , suddenly , the motive started to wear out . I used to get great , great satisfaction from my work , and it gave me my reason to respect myself . And when you start to lose that , it 's very traumatic  --  because no longer does just working make you happy . " Martin says he 's taking time off now , not working  --  to see what happens . He 'll ride his bike in the morning . Read and answer the phone in the afternoon . " I 'm going to stop myself from thinking , " he says , " just to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stands at the threshold of trying to exist , rather than pondering existence , he offers one more thing to think about : " I heard this great quote . I think J. P. Donleavy said writing is a way of tuming your deepest pain into money . " He breaks into his big tragicomic smile and then laughs . " But now I realize that 's not even cynical . Writing is a way of forming your pain into something . So it 's a way of delivering it to someone else . " STEP NUMBER EIGHT : LEARN FROM MISTAKES How did all his love problems start ? Martin offers another E-mail that he received from Ephron . " I 'm not Steve 's love adviser , " she says later , when asked about them . " That would be the blind leading the blind . Ephron was once married to Carl Bernstein . I was just writing him back after he wrote me . " This second E-mail is even more devastating and also from December 1995 : " Anyway , for what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still so hung up on women who are n't kind and sweet that seeing the ones who are is a way of being with the ones who are n't . Do you know what I mean ? " I look up at Martin . Sweet and kind ? Was your wife sweet and kind ? " My wife was strong and , uh , nice , " he says . " But those would n't be the two words that would come to mind to describe her . No . " He met British actress Victoria Tennant while they were making All of Me in 1983 . After a few years together , they married in 1986 . She was thirty-frve . He was forty-one . And even though some would say there was a discrepancy in talent between them , by Martin 's account , he married up . She was all the things he was n't . Martin was shy around strangers and had not had a long-term relationship , aside from the time he 'd spent dating Bernadette Peters . Tennant , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and was gregarious , quick to make friends . Martin had grown up middle-class . Tennant was from a cultured family  --  and her godfather was Laurence Olivier . Despite Martin 's refined sensibilities , he had never traveled much . Tennant spoke several languages , knew her way around the globe . " We eloped and were married in Rome , " says Martin , " because Victoria was the sort of woman who knew how to do complicated , impossible things like that . " They set up house in Beverly Hills and an apartment in New York , and entertained , acquired friends , bought art , traveled , inspired each other . " As far as muses go , Victoria was a good one , " says Ephron . " I think she truly knew how brilliant and talented Steve is , and that was a focus of the marriage . " Martin continued to make a picture a year  --  which has been his habit ever since his first film cameo , in The Kids Are Alright in 1979  --  but he started writing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1991 ( in which Tennant also appears ) . When he began toying with the idea of writing plays , Tennant was especially supportive . His first attempt was a comedy called Picasso at the Lapin Agile , the story of a fictional encounter between the young Picasso and the young Albert Einstein , which he says he had been waiting to write all his life . The play , like his two screenplays , offers all the Martin trademarks . It merges his interests in art , magic , science , and philosophy  --  and runs an emotional range that goes from slapstick to esoteric to schmaltz . A few critics complained that it was too showbiz , or theory of relativity lite , but Martin 's gift has always been to make the intellectual accessible , and when Picasso opened in Chicago in 1993 , and later ran in Los Angeles and New York ( where it is now ) , it was a commercial and critical success . By the debut of Picasso , Tennant was gone . While on location making a TV miniseries in 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to him as the Tom Selleck of Australia ) and returned to Martin just long enough to announce she was leaving . Later , she would explain privately to friends that though her marriage had been satisfying in some respects , Martin was emotionally unavailable . According to Martin , the divorce was n't friendly , and though the two share a circle of confidants , they rarely speak . But it was n't Tennant , he says , who devastated him . It was the subsequent relationship with Anne Heche , a twenty-five-year-old actress ( the Heartbreak Kid , as Martin 's friends now refer to her ) , that kicked him into a more reflective period . " It was a torturous love affair , " Martin says , and when the relationship ended , he found himself forty-nine , alone again , and wondering what his life was all about . " If it was a midlife crisis , " says Moore , " it was n't self-destructive or reckless or harmful to anyone else . It seemed instructive . And it was n't just about sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conventional male midlife crisis just seems to be about sex and death . And I do n't think this is about death . It 's about life . " STEP NUMBER NINE : TURN MISERY INTO ART " I spent about a year recovering , " says Martin , " and searching out myself and asking why things happened the way they did . I wrote a play about it , Patter for the Floating Lady . Oh , I should n't have told you that . I should have said I made it up . " In Floating Lady , a magician appears onstage and levitates a young woman named Angie . At the end of the play , after it 's clear these two have loved each other and never quite trusted each other and caused each other the requisite sorrows , she says , " Now I wait for a man my own age who will stand before me at arm 's length , and I will hand him unimaginable joy , and he will not move forward , and move back . Then I will hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward nor moving back . Then and only then , I will slit myself from here to here she indicates avertical line from her neck to her abdomen , open my skin , and close him into me . " The character of Angie is a little brutal in her honesty and also self-contained . She is described as " twenty-five , offbeat-looking in her clothes , wears glasses , but that 's because she 's quietly hip . She 's got something , but it 's understated . " She is also " very beautiful in her plainness . " " I 'm not attracted to really beautiful women , " Martin explains . " Certainly not to women who are all done up . But I 'm not attracted to women who , even without makeup , are considered real drop-dead beauties . I find them sort of scary . " Since the Heartbreak Kid , he has turned up at friends houses with several different women , most of them also beautiful in their plainness , as well as smart , serious , and aloof . At dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Ephron . " I 'd be grateful if he found a twenty-seven-year-old , " Bartlett says , laughing . " That would be in the older range . In any case , some of us are bemused by his romantic desires , and we also wish him the best " " I have learned , " says Martin , in defense , " that it 's possible for a fifty-year-old to have the mentality of a twenty-five-year-old . And vice versa . " " I have a theory that I tell him about , " says Moore . " It 's a version of the principle that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny , that the development of the human being mirrors the development of the human race : It seems to me that Steve is conducting his own **32;168;TOOLONG experiment in regard to women . He 's crowding the first forty years of a man 's sexual experience into a few years . Maybe when he 's eighty , he 'll catch up to women my age . I just hope by then it 's not too late . " Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a thirty-five-year-old , a fifty-year-old , and a twenty-six-year-old "  --  he is determined not to go down in history as the Guy Who Dates Young Things . He agrees with Ephron that he gravitates toward two types : sweet and kind ; and not . What 's attractive about woman who are n't sweet and kind ? " It 's valuable when you finally win them , " he says . They hate everybody else and love you ? " Well , it just means you 're constantly in the process of winning their love . Want to see the backyard ? " STEP NUMBER TEN : BE OPEN TO NEW THINGS In the backyard , the swimming pool has a basketball hoop at one end , and some rafts are leaning up against a wall . There 's a swing set in the corner , too  --  and a slide . Martin is playing Fisbee with Roger on the grass . He has a handsomeness that 's quite conventional , almost doctorish . He seems upstanding , reliable , old-fashioned . A vulnerability that might make other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the friend , " says Moore , " you 'd call in the middle of the night for help . " And there 's something about his outfit  --  the sweater and khakis and sensible loafers  --  and his manner , and something about the house , too  --  the cozy rooms , the fire going , the clutter  --  that 's very inviting , very ready . As though he were waiting for a family to appear . " Want a frozen Haagen-Dazs bar ? " Martin asks . " Nonfat ? Sorbet ? Chocolate ? It 's really , really good . It 's like a frozen sorbet chocolate thing with no fat . No dairy at all . " We head for the freezer . The tape recorder is left running , and later you can hear steps walking away as we shuffle out . Then a sniffing sound comes on . Louder and louder . Roger . " He says he could imagine having children someday , " Jennifer Bartlett says . " He just finished training his dog  --  and found it pleasurable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore . " Before , one was always loath to introduce him to a new person or to bring along someone to dinner who might , of all horrible things , turn out to be a fan . He did n't encourage anything casual or loose . But now that 's all different . " " Oh , he 's much more liberated now , " says Brian Grazer . " Before , it was about his work and the art world . Learning more about art . Being ahead of the art culture . It was always about more tangible stuff . Buying the right art . Being brilliant in another movie . Being in another hit . You know . And now he 's trying to be reflective and find a balance . " " The swing set was in the yard when I bought the house , and it seemed fascistic to tear it down , " Martin says . " Also , one never knows .... " Tennant has moved on , remarried in March  --  not to the Tom Selleck of Australia but to a Warner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a number of Martin 's friends have new , young wives and new babies . Martin sits down again . He tells a story  --  a way to explain the intangible , the thing missing from his life . The thing he keeps thinking about but is now trying not to think about . In an E-mail , he says , Nora Ephron was describing a dinner party that she and Nick Pileggi , her husband , had gone to together . While they were at the table , somebody told a story that was " sort of chilling , " says Martin , and Ephron looked up at Pileggi . She was waiting for him to make eye contact . " It 's a perfect definition of companionship , " Martin says . " It was one of those moments that marriage is all about . Somebody says something , and you just look at your mate . You have to have that eye contact . Because you know exactly what they 're thinking . It 's so joyous . " Roger stands at the glass door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . The light is soft , and the day is fading . The pool is turning a haunting blue . Twilight is coming . The paintings on the wall look beautiful , a little wistful . So does the swing set . <p>
