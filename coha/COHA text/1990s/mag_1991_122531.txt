THE SCENE : The University of Illinois-Chicago Pavilion . John McEnroe holds match point in the third and decisive set against his youngest sibling , Patrick , in the finals of the Chicago stop on the ATP tour . Not since the Bridges brothers pounded pianos in The Fabulous Baker Boys have fraternal costars generated so much chatter . Or so much tension . // Throughout this hotly contested , two-hour family affair , the elder Mac has been a study in barely contained fury  --  an un-exploded Roman candle in a warehouse fire . " I did n't want to taint my victory or his with my usual outbursts , " he would say later . " But it is not in my nature to hold things in. " // John winds up to hit what will be his last serve , but just as the toss reaches its apex , a telephone rings in the upper reaches of the arena . Distracted , John lets the ball fall to the court and steps back from the baseline . Surely this intrusion will provoke one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother and directly at his father , John Sr. , who is seated behind the court . " Dad , " yells John . " I think that 's Mom on the phone . You want to speak to her ? " // The crowd of 7,258 erupts in laughter when Patrick butts in . " Why do n't you just tell her I 'll be home soon , " he says . // " She said to make sure you miss this return , " John shouts back at his brother . // As it turned out , Patrick did n't miss the return , but John put it away with a volley into the open court to wrap up a 3-6 , 6-2 , 6-4 victory . On this day the McEnroe brothers brought out the best in each other . John , 32 , was downright civil throughout the match 's 169 points . Patrick , 24 , appearing in his first singles final , served notice that his winning a spot in the semifinals of January 's Australian Open was not a fluke . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said John Sr. " If I could have written the script , this is the way I would have done it . " // Sunday 's match was n't the first fraternal final on the men 's tour . In 1981 Gene Mayer defeated his older brother , Sandy , 6-4 , 6-2 in Stockholm . Six years later , in Madrid , Emilio Sanchez outlasted his kid brother , Javier , 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-2 . Nor was this the first time the McEnroes had squared off . In August 1985 John , ranked No. 1 in the world , routed Patrick , who was No. 440 on the computer , 6-1 , 6-2 in the first round of a tournament at Stratton Mountain , Vt. // The only thing the two brothers seem to have in common is their parents . Patrick is a righty ; John is a lefty . Patrick had to work hard to succeed ; John did n't . Patrick graduated from Stanford ; John left after his freshman year . Patrick is sociable ; John is a near recluse . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hothead , while Patrick is as stoic as any Swede on the circuit . " I remember playing in one tournament , and photographers were sitting around the court , " said Patrick . " As soon as I made one face , they all started clicking . I never made another the whole day . I did n't want to give them the satisfaction . " Could this man be from the same gene pool that produced John ? // Patrick was barely 11 when John , 18 , first reached the semifinals at Wimbledon , in 1977 . Because of the gap in their ages , John was more comfortable beating up on his other brother , Mark , now 29 and a lawyer in New York City . " But Patrick and I became competitive because he was the brother who continued with tennis , " says John . // John pushed his kid brother to pursue singles despite Patrick 's mounting success in doubles ( he and his partner , Jim Grabb , have won three titles , including the French Open and the Masters in 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter certain events only if Patrick was permitted to compete as a wild card . " In all honesty , " said Patrick , " I would n't be standing here if not for John and the support he has given me over the years . " // Now Patrick has come into his own . In the last two months his ranking has jumped from 144 to 44 . He was seeded seventh in Chicago and advanced to the finals by winning three of his four matches in final-set tiebreakers. // Perhaps the older brother has matured too . After his semifinal victory over Malivai Washington , John , the tournament 's top seed and No. 19 in the world , joked about playing Patrick . " The older brother just can not possibly lose to the younger brother , " he said . " If I do , I ca n't show my face for about six months on the planet . " // But then he continued , " I have to realize that I have a wonderful wife and two kids not to mention a third due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more money and won more tournaments than Patrick . I have to keep telling myself these things so that I do n't jump off the Empire State Building if I lose . " // John and Patrick seldom pal around on the circuit even when they are playing the same tournament , and Sunday was no exception . The match was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m . " I did n't run into Patrick until 12:30 , " said John afterward . " I might have said something like ' Do n't beat your older brother , ' but we were taking our last-minute pees in the locker room . " // When the two took to the court , Patrick neatly shorn and John sporting a red bandanna , they hugged over the net . Then , as Patrick turned and headed toward the baseline to begin warming up , John smacked his brother 's behind . // Patrick broke serve in the first game and then held , and John began to unravel  --  sort of . He started to throw his racket in disgust but stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peep . After he double-faulted three times at 4-5 to give Patrick the set , John slumped in his chair and buried his head in his towel . // The second set was very different . John won it with an impressive array of line-splitting serves , pinpoint returns and touch volleys . Patrick 's only displays of emotion were nods to acknowledge his brother 's aces . John would finish with 16. // When Patrick took a 2-0 lead in the third set , John again looked as if he were in trouble . But he reeled off four straight games en route to his 77th singles title . " I am absolutely glad that this is over , " said John . " Every emotion you can imagine is there . You 're worried about trying to win , but you know it 's your brother . You 're proud of the way he 's playing , yet you do n't want him to beat you . " // Patrick said , " Obviously , I was trying hard to win each point . But it was weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this match so badly . " // Does that mean that little brother would relish a rematch ? Patrick is emphatic : " No. " // That boosts the number of similarities between him and John to two .
