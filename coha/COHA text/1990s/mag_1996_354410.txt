ALAN DEMEURERS RECALLS IT VIVIDLY AS ONE BRIGHT moment in a succession of dark days . " I remember exactly where we were sitting , " he says . His wife Christine had by then been found to have metastatic breast cancer and believed her only hope was to undergo a costly new kind of therapy that involves the harvest and retransplant of her own bone marrow  --  high-wire medicine occupying what one of her physicians calls " the twilight zone between promising and unproven treatments . " <P> It is a measure of just how bleak those days were that this gleaming instant came when Alan at last read the thick contract from their health plan , Health Net of Woodland Hills , California . Like most Americans enrolled in such plans , the couple had never studied the document . Now , however , the specifics had become a matter of vital interest . " Good news , " Alan announced from his end of the family sofa in Murietta , California . " It 's covered . " <P> And so for the deMeurerses began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powerful forces that are fast reshaping the culture and practice of medicine in America  --  not just cutting costs but changing in a fundamental way how doctors view patients , and perhaps how patients should now view doctors . In a three-month investigation , TIME chronicled Christy deMeurers ' journey , but also the parallel , interlocking story of Health Net , one very prosperous company in the Southern California market , a hotbed of managed care that offers a living demonstration of what 's likely to occur everywhere else as the new medicine continues its rapid advance . Taken together , the two stories provide a look deep inside the psyche of a managed-care company that is typical of the hundreds blooming and merging throughout the nation . These organizations have jettisoned the old Marcus Welby-style medicine for something entirely new , in which doctors become " gatekeepers , " patients become " covered lives " and remote managers decide who gets treatment and who does n't . <P> " It 's a paradigm shift , " says William Popik , Health Net 's chief medical officer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly than patients are ready for  --  that 's absolutely true . What 's shifting is , patients ca n't drive it anymore ; patients ca n't decide , ' My ear hurts , so I 'm going to go to the doctor today . ' " <P> Prodded by large companies fed up with rising medical costs , the new medicine 's entrepreneurs have turned health care into a corporate battlefield increasingly governed by the promise of stock market wealth , incentives that reward minimal care and a brand of aggressive competition alien to front-line doctors for whom dressing for success still means wearing khakis and a lab coat . <P> No one disputes that managed care has at last put the brakes on medical spending , or that it has proved an effective vehicle for rationing health care , a profoundly sensitive subject in a culture raised on the notion that even the most expensive and esoteric treatments should be available to all . At issue , rather , are the costs of the process itself  --  the effort and delay inherent in acquiring care and the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear by corporate managers who must approve even such minor procedures as blood tests and mammograms . Yet the most fundamental question raised by the new medicine is one largely missing from public debate : Can you still trust your doctor ?
