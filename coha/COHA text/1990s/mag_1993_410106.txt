How do good skiers manage to look so fluid and well balanced while less proficient skiers get bounced this way and that whenever the terrain is anything but a soft corduroy carpet ? How do experts keep their upper bodies so seemingly quiet and facing down the hill while intermediates " spin out " at the end of a turn and end up with their whole bodies facing uphill ? How is it that accomplished skiers float down the hill , never seeming to work very hard , while the less-skilled put tremendous effort into their skiing but end up flailing instead of floating ? The answer lies in the trunk . Last year , I wrote an article for SKIING ( " Unlock the Trunk , " October 1992 ) , introducing the idea that trunk movements are an integral part of skiing . I isolated one important trunk movement , side bending , and provided easy home exercises to help skiers create the angulation they need for effective edging , which is a critical component of control . In photos that accompanied the article , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rigid spine , but after a few days of working with the exercises , he learned to bend his trunk to each side and , most important , to feel the change . His skiing improved dramatically . But side bending is not the only important trunk movement . Equally fundamental is trunk rotation . Trunk rotation is the ability to twist the torso around its own vertical axis . When you combine this twisting action with side bending , you are utilizing two trunk movements that are crucial to skiing . It is these movements that separate the terminal intermediate from the all-around accomplished skier . Without resilient but disciplined trunk movements , the legs and arms can not move properly or easily . Without appropriate trunk movements , the whole body can not move with grace and intention . Now look at the common problem referred to earlier , in which the skier overturns or spins out at the end of the turn . What 's happening is that the whole body  --  feet , legs , trunk , arms , shoulders , and probably head  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue rotating on a pedestal . This leads to too much turning momentum , resulting in the spin-out syndrome . Yes , it 's possible to turn your skis this way , but this movement is inefficient , unrefined , and uncontrolled . There is no easy flow from one turn to the next because the momentum at the end of each turn is directed uphill instead of down . The advice that 's usually given to solve this problem is to " face down the hill . " What is meant by this is to turn your whole upper body in the direction you intend to go  --  and keep it there . There are two problems with this advice : First , it assumes that you have the ability to twist your body , and second , it implies that good skiing requires you to adopt artificial set positions . Skiing is not static ; it is continual , fluid , and disciplined motion . In fact , it 's the resilience of your trunk , including the twisting and untwisting action , that assists your feet and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arc of each turn , linking turns together and controlling the speed of descent while allowing your upper body to move in a shorter , more direct line down the mountain . The paradox is that a movable upper trunk creates a quiet upper body . How you rotate your trunk is important . Most skiers try to twist only at the waist , keeping the rest of the spine rigid . But the majority of the twisting must occur in the middle and upper parts of the back , because the lumbar region ( lower back ) ca n't twist very much . Why do n't people naturally twist their upper backs ? Because such movements are foreign to them . People feel that their rib cages inhibit the movements of their upper spines , but their ribs are joined to their spine by joints and are capable of a surprising amount of individual movement . When the ribs can move , so can the upper spine . So instead of stressing out one area by twisting only at the waist , distribute the load . Allow turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the spine . Twist your whole trunk . The ability to twist the trunk assists skiers at all levels . It can help beginners improve their balance . It can help cure intermediates of the spin-out syndrome and aid them in learning to link their turns in a continuous flowing movement down the hill . And it can assist advanced skiers in their use of classic wind-up-and-release movements that bring powerful and well-directed energy to their turns . The trunk twists during the wind-up phase . Then , when the ski edges are released , the skis and the legs swing around to line up with the upper body , unwinding the trunk . It 's something like twisting a rubber band and then letting it go . When the timing is perfect , it feels as if the skis explode into the new turn without any effort . Traditionally , skiers prepare themselves for the season by a regimen of leg strengthening exercises , or they concentrate on aerobic workouts to enhance overall fitness . These are important , but they do n't train the body to ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skiing will be , too , and it makes little difference that your legs are strong and your cardiovascular capacity high . As you do the movement sequences outlined here , you 'll learn to listen to your own sensory feedback , to feel what your body is doing as it moves . This will tell you a great deal about your usual movement patterns , ranges of motion , and other habits . Habits are necessary , but they can also be a nuisance when they and have the time to move slowly , gently , and deliberately . That 's the advantage of doing the movements at home . The familiarity of the home environment will also let you feel safe enough to experiment , to make mistakes , to have fun . Do the exercises with an innocent , open , and inquiring mind . Leave your judgmental self somewhere else . Keep in mind that you 're learning , not performing . Play around with each movement slowly until it becomes automatic and you assimilate its essence . As your awareness of appropriate trunk movements grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember : Good use of your torso supports and facilitates the actions of the rest of your body . As you learn to listen to your own sensory feedback , you 'll begin to make the kinds of discoveries about your skiing that have been eluding you for years . So go ahead : Free up your trunk , break out of your old habits , and let the fun begin . BEFORE YOU BEGIN Stand up , bend your knees a little , swing both arms around yourself , and see how it feels to turn your body in one direction and then the other . Notice any tightness or ease of movements , any discomfort or pain  --  in other words , take stock of your body in a general way . In particular , be aware of how your knees feel when you twist . Now , as you 're playing around with the exercises below , always keep this in mind : Compare the sensations of each side of the body ( left and right ) ; compare the feelings you get from different exercises ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which feel foreign or unnatural . Instead of forcing a movement in one direction so that it 's equal to the movement in the other direction , do the opposite : Make the movement smaller , lighter ; equalize by doing less , and then gradually allow the whole trunk to become involved . As you bring more of your body into the movement , and learn to listen to your own sensory feedback , the movement becomes more fluid , and a bigger range of motion can happen without strain . The goal of these exercises is to enable you to rotate your body farther and more easily , so that this fundamental trunk movement becomes a natural part of your skiing . BODY ROLL Lying on the floor , your head and arms directed toward the ceiling , rock your knees gently from side to side . At first it may feel as if all the twisting is taking place in the lower back . But go slowly and give yourself the opportunity to notice twisting going on throughout the whole trunk , all the way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ribs as they shift in relation to each other . Be aware of these rib movements against the floor . Take the time to feel and appreciate the subtle movements of the torso as it twists around the spine . Tune in to what you feel . THE HUG This movement can be done in any position , anywhere  --  sitting , lying down , standing , walking , even skiing . ( Initially , it may be easiest to feel this by lying on your back with your knees up . ) Hug yourself until you can grasp your shoulder blades with your fingertips . Now alternately pull each shoulder blade gently , noticing that they slide as the trunk twists . Notice also that as you do this , the elbows , the collar bones , and the upper ribs also move . What do you tend to do with your head initially ? Probably rotate it in the same direction as everything else . Make use of the principle of playing around with variations by taking the head in the opposite direction to the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , the head goes to the left . As you get used to this way of moving and would like another challenge , turn your elbows and eyes in one direction as your head moves in the opposite direction . ( See " Eye Games " on page 162 . ) UPPER BODY SWIVEL Begin by sitting on a firm , flat surface with your arms held out as if you were holding ski poles . Now turn your upper body , once again paying attention to the graduated twisting that needs to occur throughout the whole spine and trunk . Make sure you feel both sitting bones against the chair . This puts more emphasis on the need to twist the upper trunk , which many people initially find difficult . Begin by moving your head and arms together , and then do some movements with the head moving in the opposite direction . Feel the twisting in your chest and ribs  --  this is the key . Now return to the first movement , with your head and arms moving together away from your legs and feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simultaneously in opposite directions is a complex skill that resembles movements used in skiing . X MARKS THE SPOT Stand up and twist your whole body in one direction without changing the position of your feet . For example , twist to the left , moving your right arm and pointing your right index finger as far around as you can easily turn , looking along your arm . Note the spot where your finger is pointing . Now , leaving your hand pointing at the spot , turn your head so that it faces forward ( see photo ) . ( Photo omitted ) Holding this position , move only your eyes to the right and left a number of times , and feel the funny sensation . Now untwist your body so that it faces forward , and rest . Next , twist your head and body to the left as before to see where your finger points now . Keep turning to the left a few more times , using the variations outlined in " Eye Games . " Return to the original movement and compare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole exercise to the right side . THE STROLL Stand in position as if skiing , with your arms out holding imaginary poles . As you look straight ahead , turn your feet slowly until they are pointing " across the fall line , " keeping your arms pointed straight ahead or " down the hill . " Feel your spine twist all the way up to your armpits . Find ways to minimize the twisting pressure in your lower back . Breathe , relax your chest , let it be malleable and feel the ribs move until the turning expands throughout your whole spine . Once this is familiar , you can make the movement more like skiing by walking forward at the same time . Or , take this into jogging , pretending to plant a pole as a signal to change direction of the movements of the feet . You can even hop and twist as you 'd do in short turns . EYE GAMES Here are some general examples of eye movement relating to trunk rotation that can be used in conjunction with any of the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your head and trunk . * Fix your gaze in front of you and turn your head without moving your eyes . * Turn your head in one position and your body in another and hold that position . Then turn only your eyes left and right . ( For example , in the photo , my shoulders are straight on , my head is turned to the right , and I am moving my eyes left and right. ) * Turn your trunk in one direction , your head in the other , and have your eyes follow the trunk , all at the same time without straining . Feel the actual movements of your eyes themselves and notice if the movements are smooth or jerky , horizontal or wavy , and notice if you have an easier side . Please note : These movements can have a powerful effect ; be careful not to overdo it . CHECK FOR CHANGES After doing any or all of the exercises in this article , stand up and repeat the swinging movements you did at the beginning ( " Before You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you twist ( particularly in the lower back ) . Also note if your knees feel any different . For example , there may be less strain in your knees as you turn than previously . Once you are familiar with these exercises , you can experiment with them at any time  --  at home , going for a walk , at work or at the movies . Most important , these turning movements , which utilize your entire spine , will provide you with sensations and an understanding that will allow automatic and spontaneous new movements to be part of your skiing , every time you ski . WORKSHOP SCHEDULE During the upcoming ski season in Vail , Colorado , Margaret McIntyre will be leading three " Integrated Skiing " workshops : December 11-16 , January 10-15 , and January 16-21 . The workshops , as well as companion audiotape sets , incorporate the principles and exercises described in this article . For details on the workshops and tapes , call 303-949-5529 , fax 303-949-6124 , or write to Integrated Learning Systems , Inc. , P.O. Box 342 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move slowly . Give yourself time to feel each movement . * Move gently . Forcing the movement reinforces old habits . * Rest between movements . Each repetition can be a little different , and you can learn from each one . * Breathe as you move . * Be aware . Notice how each movement feels , and be clear about making distinctions between the movement of one part of you relative to another . This is not as easy as it sounds . * Search for comfort . If you feel pain or the slightest discomfort , back off and make the movements lighter . If necessary , just imagine the movement ; you can still learn . * Experiment . Be curious , not judgmental . THE EYES HAVE IT Eye movements are an integral and habitual part of trunk rotation . Human beings are structured like upright cylinders that have the capacity to twist around their own internal axis . We first learn these twisting movements as babies rolling on the floor , and then gradually , over time , we learn to take them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve the eyes : We tend to go where we look , and this starts the formation of one of our strongest and earliest habits  --  linking eye movements with trunk rotation . We take this early pattern into all our complex motor activities , including skiing . In addition , most of us have a dominant eye , one we prefer to use . We orient ourselves around this eye . This is often why it may be easier to turn the body to one side than to the other . Doing something unusual with our eyes in relation to a particular movement of another part of our bodies has a very powerful effect on our nervous systems . This is one of the easiest and quickest ways to bring about changes in habitual movement patterns . The goal of the exercises on the next page is to increase the ability to turn the body without increasing force . THE FELDENKRAIS STORY Many of the movement ideas in this article were developed by Moshe Feldenkrais and are used throughout the world by Feldenkrais practitioners . Born in Russia in 1904 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He received a doctorate in physics from the Sorbonne and with his colleague and associate , French Nobel laureate Frederic Joliot-Curie , he conducted some of the first experiments in atomic energy . He was also an athlete  --  an accomplished soccer player and the first European ever to receive a black belt in judo ( he wrote five books on its technique and theory ) . In 1942 , a series of sports-related knee injuries  --  and the shortcomings of conventional treatment at the time  --  left him facing the possibility of permanent disability . He decided against surgery and set out to cure himself . He began an intense study of anatomy , physiology , neurology , biomechanics , cybernetics , and movement development . After two years of research and experimentation , he succeeded in restoring his ability to walk normally without pain . Even more astonishing , he took up judo again and was able to continue practicing at the black-belt level until the age of 68 . He developed thousands of unique movement lessons , which he tested on his friends and colleagues , relieving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with remarkable success . Later he worked with musicians , dancers , athletes  --  anyone wishing to expand his or her physical capabilities . The Feldenkrais Method is a unique form of sensory motor learning . It is based on the idea that learning comes from within and is not simply a process of imitating what others do . It is training or retraining the brain to control the muscles so the body can move optimally . This is done by paying attention to the sensory feedback you get while exploring movements in various ways . It 's not just what you do but how you do it that counts . First you learn how to feel what your body is doing ; then you use that information to create or improve your actions . Typically , when learning a new skill , most people work too hard , striving for results . This reduces their ability to feel , or trust what they do feel , or even understand that feeling is vital to learning . With less feeling there is less ability to make changes . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't fully understand it until you experience it for yourself . Margaret McIntyre , a former Vail ski school instructor , is a physical therapist and Feldenkrais practitioner from Vail , Colorado . She specializes in adapting Feldenkrais ideas to create new ways of teaching movement in sports such as skiing , golf , tennis , windsurfing , and running . In her private practice she works with people who have clinical problems ( such as pain or disability from old injuries ) as well as those who are simply trying to enhance sports performance , either in a group format or one-on-one . <p>
