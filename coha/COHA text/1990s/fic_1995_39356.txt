I 'm in a city called El Paso . I could point it out on a map . Right here , here it is . There is longitude , latitude . For most , this is enough , a satisfactory explanation . But say we do n't use all these imaginary concepts . Say there is no west of or east of or north of or south of . Forget all that . Forget these legalistic boundaries . No Texas here , no Mexico there , no New Mexico . Forget all that . Here 's a river . Here are mountains . A sky above . Night , day . Sun and moon . Where there are people , there are buildings , and streets , and walkways . There are colorful and not so signs with messages that can be reduced to words . Eat . Sleep . Money . Work . Play . Away from those , and away from the buildings and people , the brown soil is a rock even at its surface . The vegetation is sparse , gray-green , low to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that river . <p> I walk on the streets . Or drive . Think about what I did before . How maps worked . I would open them and trace a road and I 'd get there and I 'd think I had discovered something , that I knew where I was . I 'd go into a bar . Sit on a stool facing mirrors reflecting mirrors and bottles and think how this offered not just solace but solution . Or drugs . Or love . Or sex . I remember when I 'd meet a woman . The old answer , the first answer . Find a woman , lose myself through a woman , find myself : Here I am . <p> Only a thick pane of glass and a sidewalk away , she 's been glancing back at me  --  is n't she ?  --  as she talks to a gray-haired man with a luxury car . She 's huskier than him , a few inches taller , and as dramatic and endowed as fantasy : it 's her red dress and wavy black hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint , that halos her , and a nasty kink in her eyes which I can see even at this distance . <p> She is sitting across the booth I 'm in . Her name is Mayela . We are in a coffee shop downtown where sunburned truck drivers talk the loudest in drawling English , tattoos on their hairy arms , wearing cowboy hats . Women , having lunch , wear nylons and high heels and imitation pearl necklaces . The coffee is too hot , too old , too black , too thin , and I color it with the white liquid that is n't milk . The waitress has a bun of hair bobby-pinned to the top of her head , two cloth flowers stitched into the net containing the bun . The mix is fertile and intoxicating , though like a drug cut with strychnine , there is an edge on the rush , a rustling breeze of death , and the whirl makes bold the blood and breath and muscle . When it has become later , the same restaurant , the sky blue-red , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no one else , not even the waitress pouring more coffee , and now she , not us , is the phantasm . <p> Mayela tells stories of men : fathers , brothers , cousins , lovers . Mayela has a husband . He lives in Houston , a dangerous American town where he left her by herself too often . She could not be alone like that , she says , as if of no more or less importance , and she never loved him . She only wanted to get away any way she could . Hers was n't a home , that mud building near Chihuahua . It was her grandfather 's house , and she slaved there , cleaning this , raking that , cooking , washing , nursing a grandmother and younger , fatherless children that were brother or half-sister or cousin or niece , and , then , also her mother . Her mother stopped being well for so long that one day , Mayela says , she could n't be sure she was awake or asleep . So she married , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is here because she never loved that man . She can not find a lover who can satisfy her . She is tormented by lovers . One , at twenty-two , is younger than her . Another , her boyfriend , is thirty-five , and he sometimes wants too much from her  --  he throws things , and she does n't know about him , and so she wo n't see him for days and sometimes weeks . The man with gray hair , almost sixty , treats her with elegance and dances with her in the middle of the day where lights are under the floor and tells her how to be near her is all he might ever ask for . He gave her a car , a used sports car . He says she can have a house that will be hers , and he will carry the note . Mayela says she took the car but will pay for it and that she wo n't take the house . Because there 's always payments . <p> I tell her how I feel sorry for her because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is monitored , never ignored . She is supposed to be stronger and more resistant than a man . Men always approaching her , making conversation supposed to not be about what it is . So many men , so much temptation . Too many temptations . Leaning toward her , making my voice as close as I want my body , I whisper this , t ( S that even as these words leave my lips , as my hands would move over her body , it is not me at all but her , that I am the one drawn in , that I will be the one caught and that she will be the one who has led me here . You , I tell Mayela , are temptress , and I am prey . <p> After we 've sat for a while at a bar , after several mixed drinks , she suggests where we go next . It does n't matter to me because <p> am with her and there is no better or worse . <p> We drive past the lights and the well-known streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , oldest part of town , where frail tenements are without plumbing or electricity , where the Spanish language is spoken in its most idiomatic form , so close to roots of meaning and sound that words breed like simple cells . Dark , so dark that stars glare like streetlights , while the moon hovers as in wilderness . Through this sludge of night , we cross dead , metal ribs of train tracks , warehouses whose signs are brushed over chipping plaster and brick as frequently as gang tags . We glimpse bars whose decor and patrons  --  like the jukebox boasts and cries of love and death seeming to push open their doors  --  are as elemental as horses and goats and snakes , as leather and lard , as sweat and sunburn and rocks . We search these dark night streets with the simplest of names  --  First , Second , Third-because Mayela has forgotten , until we are there . Right there , look , where so many cars are innocently parked . At a corner . A yellow light over the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read easily : The Old Dominion . <p> I am with Mayela , and she has brought me here , and I hold her hand , and she grips mine in return . It is hot outside , hotter inside , and the music is full of rhythmic bass and pulsates like a drug against the glassy eyes of the men , so many men . No , they are not exactly the eyes of men , and they are not exactly the eyes of women . One walks by in pants that are more a dress and a puffy shirt that is more a blouse , and has long , straightened black hair but also a full-faced , trimmed beard . The rest are not so metaphorical . This is not a dub to show off clothes or styles , not for satin or silk or suede , not animal-skin boots or brimmed hats . Only essences of style , what can survive in this desert , in the deepest West of all , where few things , or people , prosper . <p> I am holding Mayela 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space to stop and lean . Flesh is the steam of the club , the expiring hot moisture . Flesh . It 's what I 'm here for . There is no difference between them and me in this . Mayela stops , and I remain very close to her . <p> These men want men in the Old Dominion and do n't pretend indifference , do n't disguise . And some women who want women , too , and before several pass us , they slow down , then from toe to head and mostly in between , imagine Mayela . Mayela offers no reward for their attentions . They look at me and wink , raise eyebrows , hand-signal approval and envy . We are the most obvious here . Mayela is a large , tall woman , and full , and I stand over her in cowboy boots . <p> Mayela says something I do n't hear over the pounding amps . The club is too crowded , and it is dirty , the brown , ever-blowing desert on the rug , bar , dance floor , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches Mayela . They hug , then talk into each other 's ears , then she indicates for me to guard the drink I 've bought her , then goes with him to the smooth floor in front of us . She dances without excess , with contented movements . The man twirls and spins around her , laughing , gesticulating , his hips and arms seductive , suggestive , very close to her body . Mayela 's modest grin is constant and cooperative . I am drinking too much , and it , too , disorients me . I order another for myself . I am remembering where I am . I am with Mayela , who is dancing with another man . <p> There are metal poles at the corners of the dance floor . They are bolted at the floor and ceiling . A few feet up , a crude platform circles each , and a muscular male dancer in a G-string undulates against his pole , rolling against and around it , riding , humping . It is a strain , frightening , because I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my psyche . Beneath the G-string are men , not women , men who are running their hands up and down the platform dancer , squeezing , caressing his calves and thighs and ass as he slides and rubs the pole between his legs , eyes dosed in rapture . It is like my sexual yearning , only played out by a naked man against a pole with other men running their hands over him . Then again , no : when I want a woman , I want that one woman and not any woman , not Woman . <p> And Mayela is still dancing , though the man has left her . Now she is with a woman , and they are the only women on the dance floor , and the men are watching the two of them , and now I am watching them watch . In this heat they are sweating , their skin <p> milky pallor , thick and sticky . <p> I 'm rubbing Mayela 's neck while she listens to the woman she danced with . I want to feel her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm drunk . She reaches around , touches my hand , but she has to listen to what I can not hear . So I finish another drink . <p> Then we are on the dance floor , at the center , because Mayela has insisted on taking it . We are the spectacle , we are the couple . At the perimeters are the men , and those few women , seeing us , detailing . Mayela is circling me , her dress , yellow as sunshine , at once whirling away and clinging to her body . Hers is not a show for me , and not a show for them . It is for herself , as unconscious as trance . I 'm miserable until I realize it is only the phantasm , and I am free . I am with Mayela . I am the man with Mayela . <p> Todd , it is explained , is a friend of Mayela 's friend , the man she 'd danced with . He is young , maybe twenty-one , and he knows Mayela from before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair that is cut stylishly short . It is moussed , he tells us . Todd has drawn the faintest of purple lines around his dark black Mexican eyes . We are outside the dub , leaning against parked cars , smoking marijuana . It 's late . It is still dark , the only light the dim one above the club entrance facing the other street . Power lines drape over us , linked from one wooden pole to another , hanging above buildings , going in here and there , never visibly ending . Swamp coolers stand on top of the roofs waiting for daylight . It is dark except for the hot cherry of the joint and Mayela 's yellow dress and Todd 's white shirt buttoned to the top , and stars that remind us the desert is beneath and around us , and the moon , and the red square taillights becoming smaller on the street 's horizon until they are no more . <p> Todd has been cruising several guys this evening . He does n't know which will work out for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him , he tells her . <p> He talks with a need to , and Mayela and I must listen to him . Mayela asks about his brother . He has tested positive , Todd says , but he does n't have it yet , it is still dormant . He takes pills he gets in Juarez , Todd says . It is quiet and so hot , even with a breeze . His brother still likes to dress up , Todd says . He puts on a dress and goes out . He wants to have the operation but how , and , with this disease possibility , he is in a panic . He is so scared and lost and confused , Todd explains . It is quiet except when someone else enters or exits the club and the music pours out , jackhammering the sidewalk and asphalt . And then suddenly Todd changes his mood and pitch . His brother 's such a whore , and he wants to live as much as he can now ! And then , as abruptly , Todd drops this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most interested in tonight . <p> Stop . I have to leave . We have to go . <p> I 'm not sure where I 'm driving , but we are back in the lights of downtown , away from the stars . I 'm telling Mayela that it was , it was , that I was trying . She says she 's used to it . And she likes these men . They are a challenge to her , she says . <p> A challenge ? The car windows are down , and the wind , like the heat , is an unmistakable presence . <p> For example , she says , her friend . Who is Todd 's friend . She knows he wanted her . Tonight when she was dancing , the woman , she knew that woman wanted her . But so did he . Did I notice ? She says she always knows these women want her , but her satisfaction comes from knowing she has attracted a man like Todd 's friend , because he does n't want women . Only a special woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he wanted her . Did <p> understand how she knew ? <p> I see the dancer in the G-string riding that pole . <p> Mayela 's face is the color of a kiln-dried , earthen mask . Her nose is broad , her cheeks are high , her eyes slant and are as dark as love and fear . Mayela is not only beautiful . Only I do n't know the mythology , I do n't know the gods or the demons . <p> I am alert , and I remember where I am going : to the bar where she parked the sports car her gray-haired man gave her . <p> You think I 'm a lesbian ? she asks , noticing my shift . <p> I 'm imagining Todd 's brother in a dress . Or I 'm imagining her riding the metal pole between her legs . I ca n't think of what to say , though , so I do n't say anything . And I 'm not sure about what she is asking me . <p> Well , I 'm not , she tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I stop in the parking lot next to her sports car . I turn my head toward her , and say , This is when it 's supposed to be the good night kiss , is n't it ? <p> We do n't kiss good night , she informs me , both mad and hurt . <p> We . I see Todd 's friend rubbing himself against her on the dance floor . <p> Good night . <p> Slowly she opens the door for herself . Slowly she walks to her own car . I wait , politely , for her to get inside , to start the motor . <p> I am in El Paso . It is 1989 . <p>
