In Austin , James David forges an innovative garden style <p> Austin , Texas , sits on the banks of the Colorado River at the edge of the Hill Country . Cut by canyons and ravines and watered by springs , Austin 's green hills are - home to cactus and wild crab apple and columbine  --  and to the garden of landscape architect James David ( pronounced da-VEED . Here , at the crossroads of South and West , David gardens , designs , experiments  --  and opens eyes to the beauties and possibilities of the Hill Country landscape . <p> No garden speaks more eloquently to those possibilities than David 's own acre and a half in Austin 's western hills . Doves and mockingbirds flutter among daggers of yucca . Native plants mingle with Mediterraneans in combinations that make you see a sun-drenched Van Gogh landscape one minute and a Texas prairie the next . As fellow Austin gardener Frances Smith puts it , " Jim 's claim to fame is that he recognized the possibilities for gardening here . It used to be azaleas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants in the west . Jim has shown us that there 's a lot more  --  that gardening here really is a good deal . " <p> Native plants have intrigued David since his years as head of the landscape architecture section of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department . In that position , from 1973 to 1980 , he traveled around the state looking at land , talking to people , and restoring historic gardens . " I started out designing only native plant gardens , but they were boring , " he says . Then he took a design course in England , saw the diversity of English gardens , and thought : " Why be such a purist ? I do n't live in a natural situation . My septic system is not natural . " His goal today , he says , " is to show people good design and get interesting plants out to the public . " To native regional plants he adds a range of plants that flourish in Both wet and dry tropical climates . For example , he will use gingers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingers and crinums in southwestern gardens . I thought of them as so tropical , as not belonging to this climate . But then I began to realize that in the middle of summer they have a freshness about them when everything else is drooping . " <p> Texas can be a frustrating place in which to garden because it poses tough conditions for plants : drought and deluge , " blue northers " and scorching heat . Austin is located in USDA Zone 8 , but zone maps are virtually useless in south central Texas . True desert plants are unhappy here because they have to withstand humidity and unpredictable cold snaps . The limestone and caliche soil base harbors deadly fungi , and the climate combines withering heat and high humidity year-round . Rainfall averages 35 inches per year , almost all of it coming in spring and fall . <p> To combat fungi and poor drainage , David uses raised beds and searches for resilient varieties of plants . He also adds a half-and-half mix of granite gravel and a light cedar-and-compost-based soil blend to beds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas gardens . But it is not only his deft solutions that make David distinctive . His gardens blend classical elements of design with a wide-ranging love of plants and architecture . <p> David 's personal , informal signature stands out , even from the street . Above a wide , red gate , branches of a pear tree bow under the weight of bottles tied to them  --  the fruit growing inside the bottles for a special pear dessert . Fig and apple and citrus trees make a small orchard just inside the wall . Not so obviously practical is a native crab apple ( Malus ioensis var. texana ) . But its delicate pink blooms will be followed by small green " crabs , " excellent for making tart preserves . <p> Inside the gate , a gravel path meanders like a dry creek bed across the entry court and under an arbor constructed of concrete posts and iron lintels . ( " Gravel is cheap and southwestern plants flourish in it , " David points out . ) Spanish grapevines leaf out on the columns of the arbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines . Just outside the front door , sun-loving plants welcome you to a Spanish-style farmhouse . An orange-red carpet of poppies spreads under terra-cotta pots bursting with prickly pears , cascading white alyssum , and purple johnny jump-ups . Spiky blooms of Manfreda maculosa , a cousin of the agave , rise above fleshy , mottled rosettes . Ice plant and stonecrop and papery yellow evening primrose ( Oenothera macrocarpa ) tumble out of stone planters . Though spring has barely begun , the entire front wall of David 's home ripples with neon-green seven-leaf creeper ( Parthenocissus quinquefolia ) , its tendrils climbing and curling toward the red mission-tile roof . <p> Beyond the sun-washed charms of the gravel terrace and arbor , a lower lawn stretches into view along the south side of the property . No lover of lawns , David points out that the practical reason for its existence is the septic field underneath . This surprising field of green slopes up into a woodsy ramble bordered by deutzias and native vibumums and shaded by oaks , magnolias , and a specimen blue Atlas cedar ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnolias , along with gingers and a sweet olive of two , are reminders that David grew up in New Orleans . They are also evidence of the creative leaps and turns he makes . " I used to be more rigid in my design philosophy , " he says . " But I have gotten more comfortable with ideas I used to reject  --  what Robert Frost called riding ' easy in the harness . ' " The shady glade and lawn deepen the garden 's character . In the center of the lawn , the showy , leathery leaves of a white-flowered potato vine ( Solanum jasminoides ' Variegatum ' ) spill from a French urn , offering a cool refuge in this dry land of tough and thorny characters . <p> On the south side of the house , between house and lawn , lies a postage-stamp patio . Sitting here , one can enjoy the long view of woodland ramble , arbor , lawn , and untamed hillside stretching toward the street . It is a good space for appreciating David 's open , southwestern style and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fluorescent orange impatiens in stone planters fill the quiet with their intense flowers . Ornamental sennas ( S. artemisioides ) produce showers of golden blooms in summer . Brilliant Icelandic poppies , bright yellow Dahlberg daisies , the red-and-yellow tubelike flowers of Lobella laxiflora , and aromatic , robust rosemaries proclaim their presence . In the stillness of this sheltered spot one can almost hear the plants . More than any other place in the garden , a spirit of wildness hovers here , and one waits for a deer or possum or snake to break into view on the brushy hillside just beyond the wall . <p> The garden has developed , project by project , over the past decade or so , David explains . Tall , lanky , and enthusiastic , he remains in motion even when he is sitting down . " Food came first , " he says . " The kitchen garden was the first step . " The second step was the front . The third step , the back , had a stronger plan than the front : " more formality , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five were recently completed : a pond in back at the bottom of the hill near the creek and a lap pool across the creek at the far edge of the property . <p> A salmon-pink wall separates the front and back gardens . Beyond the green door , a towering , 30-foot high-rise bird-house  --  looking more like a hotel for birds than a house  --  looms . Complete with Texas tin roof and finial on top , it is grand enough for the most regal of birds . The back garden , David says , started out as a plain ol ' Texas backyard  --  weedy , with a few tomato plants and lawn chairs . " I do n't like gardens that are made to set off the house , sort of pseudo-landscapes with nothing but evergreens , low-maintenance plants , and grass where nothing else is . " His gardens are part of the living area much of the year , where people can grow herbs and vegetables and cook and eat outside  --  a natural inclination in Texas . Set into the slope of a limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating area , which is tucked under the peaked roof just outside the kitchen and equipped with a fireplace and a grill . This makes it possible to eat outside right through the winter . In spring and summer the movable feast spreads to the lower gravel terrace , where heavy , mission-style table and chairs furnish the outdoor dining room . <p> Practical as it is , the back has nonetheless gone from yard to garden bordered with limestone retaining walls , formalized with barberry and boxwood pyramids , and terraced with gravel parterres . The back garden winds down the hillside in flights of stone steps . Down the first flight of steps , a small raised fish pool , set into the retaining wall , separates the upper terrace from the middle level . The pond is lush with water clover , dwarf horsetails , and waterlilies . At the base of the pond , maidenhair fern sprouts from cracks . Overhead , a pungent , rugged cedar conjures up images of the limestone hills of Tuscany , while bold spears of Yucca tortulosa , alongside the strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ austerity . The hip-roofed dovecote at the southern end of the garden balances the bird-house at the other end . Exclamation points at either end of an emphatic statement , they punctuate this section . <p> The northern end is as lush as Monet 's garden . Canes of the yellow climbing rose ' Mermaid ' drape the wall of the house above the glossy leaves and pink blooms of the shrubby Indian hawthorn ( Rhaphiolepis indica ) . Boxwood pyramids stretch in a neat line along a limestone wall , separating rectangular vegetable plots on two levels . More than a dozen lettuce varieties complement the Chinese garlic and cilantro and cucumbers and cherry tomatoes that show up in salads throughout the spring and summer . Planted and cared for by Gary Peese , a dedicated organic gardener and David 's partner in their gardening shop in west Austin , the vegetable plots are as ornamental and practical as the rest of the garden . <p> The back garden ranges between Tex-Mex and Tex-Med . " What I like , " David says , " are native and natural ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mediterranean  --  Moorish Spain , southern France , Tuscan Italy . " He ticks off the places , because he has traveled to each and borrowed from their rich horticultural and architectural treasury . <p> Straight , clear lines are much more apparent here than in the front . " I like structure , " David says . " Many designs fail because they 're not telling you where to look . I use the line of a bed , a plant , a fence , or a roof to say what 's important . " David 's straight gravel parterres and stone walls converge not on flower knots or fountains , but on birdhouses and vegetable plots . But wildness coexists with order . David uses strong lines and then breaks them apart with plantings , encouraging periwinkles and poppies and columbines that sprout from the limestone walls or casually seed themselves in the loose gravel . <p> David challenges Texas gardeners to try new plants and see new opportunities . Among his favorites are many Texas natives , including the Texas snowbell ( Styrax texensis ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine-red spikes of Hill Country penstemon ( P. triflorus ) ; fall-blooming blue mistflower ( Eupatorium codestinum ) , which cascades down rocky hillsides ; the graceful , orchid-flowering desert willow ( Chilopsis linearis ) ; and lacy ornamental grasses such as Lindheimer 's muhly ( Muhlenbergia lindheimeri ) , with its autumn plumes and blue-green foliage ; and native smoke tree ( Cotinus obovatus ) , with feathery flowers and leaves that turn orange and scarlet in fall . <p> David sees his southwestern garden as a " place where the accidental and the surprising are part of the plan . " The lower terrace , under the ancient live oaks , is a good spot to contemplate that plan . There , purple-flowering cenizo , or Texas sage , a familiar inhabitant of pasture and prairie , spreads in gray-green clumps alongside volunteer larkspurs and a golden-flowered Alllure coryi . ( The only yellow allium known to exist in North America , it is a beauty that David turned up on a plant-collecting trip to west Texas . ) The practical mingles with the sublime  --  the allium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravel . <p> As the sun sets , lights wink on around the canyon and headlights of cars heading home rim Austin 's western hills . A friend points to lengthening shadows falling on cactuses and sedums and praises David the plantsman : " He has an unerring eye for what a plant should be doing . I 've seen him stand , lost in thought , and then just plunge . He can snap off a branch here or move something there , and suddenly  --  Ah ! Perfection ! " At this hour , lit only by stars in the Texas sky , the garden merges seamlessly with the Hill Country  --  and seems the exact spot where South and West meet . <p> Regular contributor Barbara Seeber wrote about the U.S. Botanic Garden in the January 1995 issue of this magazine . <p> MAP : The David Garden <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A simple fountain creates an oasis beneath a wall of local limestone .
