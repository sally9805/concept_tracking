Dr. Terry McKechnie stood at the sink in his kitchen and looked out the window . It was seven-thirty in the evening . From his window he saw Los Angeles , or he saw those parts south of Sunset that stretched away toward the ocean . After dark , the lights made a yellow clutter that was beautiful , yet oddly alarming , as though it concealed a threat . Terry got a glass of water and thought about the hospital . More patients had drug-resistant tuberculosis than before . New diseases from the tropics were appearing in the city , and many of these were particularly vicious . Vicious diseases , of course , were nothing new . After all , plague had even broken out in Los Angeles , in the twenties . A couple of hundred people had died . What really left Terry staring at the lights with dread was the number of gunshot wounds he was seeing . The high-velocity rounds were particularly destructive , and he was seeing more of those cases . The gunshots were bad , but there were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking out the window . He 'd seen one the night before . As Terry stood there he realized that his state of mind was something new . He had gone through the same process as most physicians , a kind of hardening that was necessary to go on being a doctor , but recently this toughness had become insufficient . In its absence , he had moments like this , which left him wondering just where he was headed . Terry touched the Xanax in his pocket , a sample that had been left at the hospital by a drug salesman . The water tasted of chlorine , which , from Terry 's point of view , was n't such a bad thing . A friend of his , an epidemiologist , liked to remind Terry that bacteria of different species were able to exchange genetic material . As a physician , Terry liked to think that he was able to keep one jump ahead of the mutants with new antibiotics , although at times he was n't sure about this . Terry came from a long line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was on Hollywood Boulevard not far from where Terry lived now , the talk had always been of medicine , of sutures and instruments , of incisions ( Rocky-Davis , McBurney , and Battle ) , of one 's percentage in correct diagnosis . Terry 's grandfather maintained that if you were always a hundred percent correct in operating for appendicitis and never found an appendix that was n't inflamed , someone was going to die . It was better to find some appendixes that were n't inflamed than to miss one that was . Eighty percent correct was the figure he thought was right . On the day Terry received his acceptance to the UCLA Medical School , he drove from Westwood ( where , as an undergraduate , he had an apartment ) to his father 's house out in the Valley . His father had been a radiologist . Terry 's father looked at the letter , and said , " Well , we better get over to your grandfather 's , " and then they got into his car , a good , serviceable station wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went over the hill and pulled up in front of Terry 's grandfather 's house , which was built against the hillside , a series of enormous white blocks topped with terra-cotta tile . Terry 's grandfather 's name was Jack McKechnie , but everyone called him Iron Jack . Iron Jack had quit his practice , although he still treated a few of his old patients , and when Terry and Terry 's father had entered the study , which now served as an examination room , Iron Jack was checking Ben Halloway 's prostate . This was the Ben of Ben 's Supermarkets . Ben was curled up on his side , knees pulled up to his chest , pants around his ankles . Iron Jack wore a plastic glove and his eyes had the faraway look of any physician who is checking a prostate . Terry 's father held up the letter for his father to read . Ben grunted . Iron Jack said , " Yes . That 's all right . Everything 's fine , " being as economical with words , now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical school acceptance and Ben 's prostate at the same time . They had champagne in the kitchen , where Terry 's father ( who was now in a nursing home ) and Iron Jack ( who was now dead ) and Ben ( who , when Terry saw him now said he wished he was dead , the way his joints were killing him ) stood next to one another as they drank . Between sips Terry 's grandfather discussed surgical technique . A Battle incision gave the best exposure . A Rocky-Davis was made in the skin line , and left the smallest scar . He said that he had treated some gunshot wounds , bad wounds , by clamping the arteries from the heart in such a way as to divert blood to just the head and the heart . " It buys a little time , " he said . Terry wondered why it is that medicine seems to run through families , like a streak of white that some people have in their hair . And when he was preparing for medical school he often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just where on the genetic material a physician was marked , the strands of DNA twisting around each other like a banister going around a spiral staircase . In medical school , Terry attended a lecture where he had learned that one of the best questions to ask a patient , when trying to diagnose alcoholism , is " Can you remember your first drink ? " A real drunk will answer this with an uncanny clarity , recalling the clothes he wore , the time of day , the people he was with , the odors that had been in the air ( especially the scent of perfume ) , the way in which the light around him had been enhanced by warmth and brightness . Terry understood this perfectly , not in the context of alcoholism , but of the moment when he had discovered he was a universal donor . He could still remember precisely what he had been doing when he had found out . He had been standing in a biology laboratory , the light of the fall afternoon coming through the windows . The panes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a whitish haze . Terry stood next to a young woman whose cotton blouse had been dried on a clothesline , and the fabric had the scent of the open air . She had been leaning over the counter , where she was working , the fragrance of her hair mixing with that misty light . It made him feel that much more attracted to medicine because it really was in his blood after all . And in a way that he found difficult to describe , the knowledge gave him hope . Now Terry was in his middle thirties . He stood at the sink drinking water and thought about the case he had seen the night before . He turned and looked at the refrigerator , where a magnet held a wedding invitation to the door . It was from a classmate of Terry 's from medical school . Rick Bartlett . Rick once had a landlady who used to get up in the middle of the night and turn off the electricity for an hour to save money , and to beat her at her game Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , of course , sometimes the landlady slept all the way through the night , and Rick got up an hour early for nothing . In medical school , losing an hour 's sleep was a serious matter . Terry and Rick started to become friends when Terry said , " Get a windup clock . " Rick had talked about becoming a surgeon , even a neurosurgeon , but in the end he had become a dermatologist . Regular hours and good pay is how Rick had explained it , blushing as he did so . Easy practice . All you need , said Rick , are Valium and cortisone and to remember the basics : if it 's wet , make it dry , and if it 's dry , make it wet . Terry had n't seen him in years . He looked at the invitation : the printing was good , engraved , textured when you touched it . Terry had n't been getting out enough . He knew it was a bad sign when he went out and could n't talk to people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a fairly new phenomenon . When he was alone , the weight of a bad case , which previously he had been able to ignore , now seemed to combine with a general longing for an antidote to those moments when he stood at the window and drank that chlorine-tainted water . He stood there , looking at the lights from the city , the coolness and gaudy intensity of them seeming like malice itself . In the silence of the house , in which regret so perfectly mingled with desire , he reached into his pocket for the Xanax . He took half of it , estimating the rate of absorption , and then he thought , Screw it , and took the other half . Sometimes he stood at the kitchen sink until the lights seemed warmer and more appealing and even romantic . Anyway , he guessed he 'd go to the wedding . Terry practiced internal medicine , but recently he had been spending two nights a week at the hospital . One of the emergency medicine physicians had died and while the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the work . Everything took more time now than it used to : there were federal regulations to follow , hiring practices to observe , and , of course , a number of committees to consult . The hiring process had dragged on for months . Terry did n't think much was going to change . The hospital was situated south of Westwood , and it took cases from neighborhoods that were well-off and those that were n't . Usually , the gunshot cases started coming in at around eleven o'clock . Terry supposed that this was because it took a couple of hours of hard drinking in the evening to bring people to the point of using a gun . On weekends the gunshot wounds started coming earlier , although Terry usually had a little warning because the ambulance called ahead . The worst cases were those that just came in the door . No warning . There had been one of those the night before . In California , in the spring , the storms build steadily : at first there is nothing more than a mist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray than the one before . It continues like this , day by day , the soft hues of the sky slowly becoming darker and filled , too , with a hint of foreboding that can be relieved only by rain . It was in the building stage right now . Terry had driven to work glancing at the sky . A young man had arrived at about nine o'clock . Everything about him , the T-shirt he wore , the jeans , the running shoes , his jacket , suggested someone who could tell , down to a minute , what was cool and what was n't . He probably wanted to get a tattoo , but had n't been able to decide about the right one . A flower ? A nude woman ? A diamond in the small of his back ? ... ( Terry was seeing a lot of geometrical tattoos these days . ) His friends had simply brought him in , through the doors that opened with a swish , all of them running up to the triage desk . There were three friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long red hair and freckles . His name , Terry learned later , was Sam Peterson . He had been riding around in a friend 's car . They had n't been able to find anything to drink or smoke , and so the young man had gone into a convenience store and bought a can of butane . His heart had already stopped . Terry looked around for the cardiac equipment , but it was down the hall . While he went to get it , a nurse stayed with the young man . A woman was in the next cubicle , by the defibrillator : she had come to the hospital after taking a handful of Tylenol . She looked at Terry with a mixture of shame and defiance as he came in and grabbed the machine and pushed it out into the hall and from there into the room where Sam Peterson was , the nurse hammering on his chest , and saying , " Oh , shit . Oh , shit . " They put the paddles on his chest , which was pale and thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young man jumped when the electricity hit him : the suddenness of it reminded Terry of Frankenstein 's monster coming to life . There was a brutality in it , too , as if the mechanism of life had become spiteful . The heart started again , and Terry and the nurse and an anesthesiologist stood there . Terry still held the paddles . He listened for the heart . It was going all right . The anesthesiologist intubated the young man . They could control the oxygen better that way . The throat was swollen and it was n't easy to get the tube in . Terry realized that he had been clenching his jaw , and thinking , Do n't die . Do n't die . At that moment Terry heard a noise , a reassertion of ordinary sound , footsteps in the hall , the squeak of a curtain on an overhead runner , the odd rattles of a stainless steel IV stand , the distant sound of the television in the waiting room , the clicking of computer keys , all coming back as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but something that simply filtered the sound . Terry noticed some pink froth coming out of the tube that had been down the young man 's throat . The lining of the lung , where gases are actually exchanged , is only two cells wide , and Terry realized , as he saw that froth , that the butane was breaking it down . He first thought about the possibility of the boy drowning in his own blood , but that was before he thought about acidosis -- the buildup of acid in the blood . The heart stopped . They had a monitor attached to him , and Terry watched it . He could do nothing about the heart because the shocks only worked if there was enough oxygen in the blood . The anesthesiologist and Terry stood there and watched while the young man died . Anyway , in the morning , after Terry had finished his shift , he stood in front of the hospital for a while , and just at dawn he had seen the sky filled with a diffused and yet aureate glow . A few stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had n't rained and the clouds had disappeared . Then he got into his car and drove home , touching the sample of Xanax in his pocket . He did n't take it right away . He was tired enough to sleep on his own for now . In the evening , he woke and went into the kitchen , where , through the window , he saw the clutter of the city . His face was a little numb , as though he were wearing a plastic mask . Along with this , he had another sensation , which was the presence of something that seemed to suffuse the landscape with ... an impulse toward ... he did n't know precisely what , a loving inevitability , he supposed , between himself and another human being . He swallowed the bitter water . Just how was he connected to the young man , anyway ? Terry had wanted to keep him alive . This desire was something he could depend upon . It was the purest thing he had ever experienced . And what , if anything , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It was the summation of such moments , the continual addition of that sense of separation , that left Terry with the impulse toward some particular human being : he did n't know who she was exactly , but he was sure , if only by the effect of her absence , that she existed . Terry stood in the kitchen . The thing that he saw on the icebox was the invitation to the wedding .
