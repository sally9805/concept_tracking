Roger Angel is more than a virtuoso mirror maker ; he is a maestro of innovation shaping the premier telescopes of the next century . // Telescope innovator Roger Angel spins out new ideas the way the Arizona desert produces dust devils on a hot afternoon . He once dreamt up an ingenious x-ray telescope based on the matrix of square , light-gathering cells of the lobster eye . He obtained glass pans ( a new , flame-resistant style of Corning called Vision ) from a Tucson bank in exchange for opening an account . He melted the Pyrex dishes in a small potter 's kiln in an experiment which showed that borosilicate glass can be melted in telescope-mirror molds bigger than backyard swimming pools . ( With his cookware discovery , and a vision he shared with Arizona colleague Neville Woolf , he founded the renowned Mirror Laboratory at the University of Arizona . ) Angel also is making a new kind of mirror , called an adaptive-optics mirror , for ground-based telescopes . That technology involves taking light from a telescope 's concave primary mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An array of tiny loudspeaker coils behind the secondary mirror subtly bends it in a way that counteracts the light-blurring effects of atmospheric turbulence . Objects that may have previously appeared as fuzzy blobs of light resolve with the adaptive-optics technology into groups of individual stars or galaxies . " In the next few years we will see images of very faint objects at Hubblequality from the ground , " says Angel , in reference to the Hubble Space Telescope . " This is done by correcting atmospheric blurring . This is the method of adaptive optics . " Over the past decade , Angel has surpassed his distinction as a virtuoso mirror maker to become a maestro telescope innovator and technologist . He enlivens discussions around the world about how technology can enlarge astronomy 's " discovery space " in the next century . He recently won a five-year , no-strings-attached $331,000 " genius " fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation . However , Angel 's idea machine already spins at full bore.These days he is thinking about probing deeper in the cosmos with the most powerful telescopes ever imagined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of astronomy at the University of Arizona , has n't figured out is a different , new project for the MacArthur money . " I feel guilty about this , " he says , seated one recent day in a chair amid the organized chaos of his treetop-level office on the Arizona campus in Tucson . " I 've got a zillion different projects going on and I want to use the fellowship to start something new . The problem is one gets so overextended that starting something different is difficult . " Photograph // Tall , aslant stacks of papers , a partially unpacked briefcase , and Angel 's harried schedule and cheerful , boyish smile give an overall impression of frenzied mirth . A pair of 7x50 binoculars that he bought to see how they could be built for only $20 is buried under an osprey-nest-sized pile of papers on his desk . Phones ring . His administrative associate , Doris Tucker , leans through a doorway and reminds him that a publication deadline is only a few hours away .

The line of transparencies passes eight stacks of " working-file " notes , reprints , and reports on what 's left of Angel 's gray-and-white-flecked vinyl floor . He nods toward the stacks and smiles : " These are hot items . " Ingenious Inventor James Roger Prior Angel , 57 , behaves as if Yankee ingenuity was invented in Lancashire , England , his birthplace . The son of a career chemist at Pilkington Glass , a Lancashire glass-making company , Angel trained as a physicist at the California Institute of Technology and at Oxford University . Angel 's assured , British baritone voice seems too big for his thin , 5-foot 7-inch frame . The oversized lenses of his glasses droop from a face that otherwise seems perpetually alert , sympathetic , and prepared to smile . The slightly gray-haired Angel favors open collared plaid shirts and has that quintessentially rumpled look of a world-class physicist . He also could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel is a rare amalgam of chalk-board theoretician and tool-box craftsman . " He likes his graduate students to have practical experience , " says his wife Ellinor , a physician . " He asks them , What have you made ? " ' When Roger starts " flagging " during evening sessions at work and needs a tea break , he telephones his wife at their cactus-landscaped house and says , " Ellinor , put the kettle on . " The couple have two children : Jenny , a 24-year-old biology graduate student at Tufts University in Medford , Massachusetts , and James , a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Arizona . Angel stokes his creative fires by penetrating to the heart of the most difficult technological questions . Homework while preparing to refine telescope technology occasionally includes reading vintage books : He likes to retrace the thought processes and technological tricks used by technologists . " Roger is tremendously inventive , " says Robert Novick , a retired Columbia University physicist and x-ray astronomer who supervised Angel in Angel 's early years as a research associate at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decide it was n't right , take it apart , and put it back together so that it performed much better . You would find a little heap of parts left over and you knew Roger had been there . " Angel 's faintly British accent and cultured civility are disarming . But his professional vocabulary belies a driving intellectual entrepreneurialism rooted in 31 years of academic research in the United States . He has walked fearlessly into NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin 's office and offered unsolicited advice . Goldin 's mantra is faster , better , cheaper ; Angel 's is bigger , better , farther . Except for the International Space Station , Goldin wants NASA to launch smaller boxes ; Angel not only thinks outside the NASA box , he would disassemble it if given the chance . Angel brings to mind the late cartoonist Reuben Goldberg . Angel favors building the most powerful space telescopes with the fewest moving parts . Goldberg satirized unnecessary complexity and drew Rube Goldberg contraptions that accomplish simple tasks , such as opening a door , in 20 or 25 roundabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antimatter . " Roger 's mind goes from A to B through a very different path than that of everybody else , " says Martin Weisskopf , a longtime colleague and chief scientist for NASA 's Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility mission . " It makes Roger very difficult to work with . . . not because of his personality , he is not a difficult person . But it is often hard to follow his line of reasoning : When we would be discussing something we were working on Roger would say , This is going to be the answer : And I would say , Well , I do n't see that . Explain to me why . ' And he would give me the five steps of his reasoning . I would think about it , realize he was right , and also notice that I would n't have thought to go through those five steps , and in that order . " Weisskopf has met few scientists brimming with Angel 's creativity . " You need only one or two good ideas to make a career , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . " Angel started Arizona 's Mirror Laboratory , now led by John Hill , Jim Burge , Buddy Martin , and Peter Strittmatter . However , Angel 's mirror-making sojourn offers a glimpse of his idiosyncratic approach . Photograph Mirror Lab technicians install hexagonally shaped elements into an 8.4-meter mold for the Large Binocular Telescope . Next , the technicians place chunks of borosilicate glass , each of which has been carefully selected , into the mold . // Glass Beeswax Glass is the best material for telescope mirrors because it is rigid , strong , relatively inexpensive , and can be polished to unparalleled precision . A thin reflective coating of silver or aluminum usually is applied to zero-expansion glass . ( If one part of a mirror is cooler than another , a daily occurrence at an observatory , zero-expansion glass maintains its exact shape . ) Though zero-expansion glass has become the benchmark material for most modern mirrors , Angel avoids it . Glass , like cake , comes in almost infinite varieties depending on the kinds of ingredients added to pure silica sand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features can be finely adjusted . The glass preferred by Angel is the beeswax of astronomy borosilicate glass . Japanese craftsmen make it with a type of pure sandstone and borax , which is obtained from U.S. mines . Unlike zero-expansion glass , which melts at 18000 C , borosilicate glass melts at a relatively cool 1180deg C. This feature led George Ellery Hale 50 years ago to use borosilicate to make the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Mountain , California . Borosilicate-glass mirrors maintain their exact , parabolically polished shape if all regions of the mirror are somehow kept at the same temperature . Such a mirror is said to be in thermal equilibrium . The Mirror Lab has made 10 borosilicate-glass mirrors in four sizes - 1.8 meters ( 5.9 feet ) , 3.5 meters ( 11.4 feet ) , 6.5 meters ( 21.3 feet ) , and 8.4 meters ( 27.5 feet ) . Borosilicate glass , slowly heated to 1180deg C , flows like liquefied wax into the Mirror Lab 's honeycomb molds . The molds and melting glass are spun in a kiln , and the spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasts weeks . The end result is a concave saucer 1.65 inches thick with a honeycombed underside . " Oven pilots " control every phase of the heating and cooling process in a command center that resembles NASA 's mission control . Nothing is left to chance . Auxiliary electrical generators are on standby in case of power outages . The lab , built under the University of Arizona 's football stadium , once even hired undergraduates , posted at strategic points , to act as lookouts in case sewage backed up during home games . In another Angel-inspired touch , Mirror Lab scientists have developed a computerized polishing machine that looks like a robotic circular floor sander . It generates the final , exquisitely accurate curvature needed before the glass gets its reflective-metal coating . The advantage of borosilicate over zero-expansion glass is not immediately apparent . It shows up during cold nights at mountaintop observatories . As nighttime temperatures fall , the mirrors remain in thermal equilibrium because Angel 's mirrors are " ventilated " with ambient air blown through the hollow honeycombs . On the contrary , thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , they generate wavy currents of air above the mirror surface . Such convection currents are made the same way as " heat waves " that shimmer from the surface of asphalt roads on sunny days . " People who made thick , zero-expansion mirrors said , It does n't matter if they are not in thermal equilibrium : But they forgot about convection currents , " says Angel . " Their mirrors do n't distort incoming light , but the air above their mirrors does : ' The Mirror Lab 's 3.5-meter ( 11.4-foot ) mirror in the **31;1065;TOOLONG Optical Astronomy Observatories ( WIYN ) telescope demonstrates Angel 's point . " The WIYN mirror at Kitt Peak ( Arizona ) is making much better images than any other telescope on the mountain because it is ventilated , " Angel says . " It gets rid of this convection problem " Photograph Once the proper amount of glass is loaded , the furnace dome is lowered into position and heating begins . The furnace , and the mold within it , spins at seven revolutions per minute during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the few relatively new telescopes Angel has had little to do with . Hubble 's technology was developed as part of the United States spy-satellite program . Angel 's primary connection to Hubble was his service on a panel of experts that investigated Hubble 's flawed 2.4-meter ( 94.5-inch ) primary mirror . Since the shuttle repair mission in 1993 , the $2-billion Hubble has demonstrated the many advantages of telescopes that orbit above Earth 's interfering atmosphere . Hubble has helped astronomers measure the expansion of the universe , discover black holes , locate very young galaxies , and find what perhaps is the first extrasolar planet to be directly photographed . ( Hubble 's infrared camera was able to find the suspected planet because it is unusually hot and it seemed to have a prominent trail of hot dust and gas . ) Hubble images of planetary nebulae , newborn stars , and other objects have stunned both scientists and the public . Unfortunately , Hubble is expected to wear out by 2005 . Its less expensive successor , NASA 's $500-million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers to make more fundamental discoveries . NGST will have better light detectors , a bigger mirror , and a higher , colder orbit to reduce the amount of infrared pollution radiated from the telescope . Currently , the best ground-based telescopes can resolve objects that are , at least , about 0.5 arcsecond apart . ( The moon is roughly 1,800 arcseconds wide . ) Hubble can resolve objects that are as little as 0.1 arcsecond apart . Ordinary extrasolar planets are thought to lie within an arcsecond of their parent stars , possibly much closer in some cases . They will be difficult for a telescope to distinguish in the visible spectrum amid the billion-times-brighter glare of the parent stars . Seeing a planet orbiting a nearby star would be as difficult as seeing a firefly flash in front of an office building engulfed in flames . ( A dozen or so extrasolar planets the size of Jupiter have been detected indirectly from the gravitational " wobble " they impart on their parent stars . ) NASA wants a mirror eight meters ( 26.2 feet ) in diameter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 . The eight-meter NGST mirror is intended to resolve objects that are as close as 0.03 arcsecond apart . The space telescope will use infrared-heat detectors to peer past the warmmirror glow that usually obscures Hubble 's vision . The mission of NGST is to discover how , when , and where the first galaxies formed . However , because of the large size of NGST 's mirror , the glare of stars would be diminished . Therefore , in theory , NGST also could locate the reflected visible light from planets orbiting nearby stars such as Altair or Vega - if such planets exist . The four teams vying to build NGST are led by Lockheed Martin , Ball Aerospace , NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , and TRW . The Giggle Factor In his typical idiosyncratic fashion , Angel 's proposal for the NGST mirror is radical . He thought , why not make NGST 's primary mirror a larger version of his two-millimeterthick adaptive-optics mirror ? NASA engineers laughed when they heard about the weird idea . ( Angel is notorious among his colleagues for suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harnessing the power of Arizona 's afternoon dust devils . It would be done by first spinning a giant plastic bag of hot air , anchoring the bag in one spot , and releasing the twirling air to initiate a dust devil . ) Photograph // Aware that he was in danger of being laughed out of the NGST competition , Angel and his Mirror Lab team , led by Steve Miller , actually made a half-meter prototype of their proposal in only three months . Angel unveiled the prototype in 1996 at a NASA meeting in Greenbelt , Maryland . The prototype was incredibly light , tough , and inexpensive . It also showed near-Hubble-image quality in its first laboratory tests . The sight of the unconventional mirror and its test data stunned the audience of scientists and engineers involved with competing teams . The laughter had vanished . Angel had scored another technical coup . Or had he ? " Angel 's prototype proved that we can do this NGST project , but what surprised me was how quickly he did it , " said John Mather , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If he had n't done it I think this giggle factor would have persisted a lot longer . " Jokes about the bloody " cutting edge " of technology do n't faze Angel . He is magnetically attracted to risk . Jim Burge , an optical scientist at Arizona and principal investigator of its two-meter ( 6.5-foot ) NGST Mirror System Demonstration project , often is caught between Angel 's genius and project deadlines . " Sometimes it is really frustrating when Roger comes up with this brilliant idea half way through the program , " says Burge . " And lots of times the direction really should be changed . But sometimes I have to tell him , No , we ca n't make those changes this time . " ' NASA 's Mather also understands the plainspoken Angel . " Roger has a very good sense of what is important and what is not . He was the only person out of all the people giving us presentations ( at the fall 1996 meeting ) about their ideas who actually had formulas in mind and will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . " But the mirror that Angel is convinced is the best is not necessarily what Mather and other NASA officials think will be selected for NGST . The primary reason could be that the initial Angel-Lockheed design was the only one that called for a one-piece mirror . The design , while simpler and more elegant , would require a vehicle whose diameter is larger than the mirror 's to lift it into orbit . The other three designs call for segmented mirrors that would unfold like origami butterflies once they were in space . Angel eschews the very notion of a segmented mirror . He stops short of calling them Rube Goldbergs . Says Angel : " I see the advantages of making the darn thing in one piece and testing it in one piece so that what goes into the rocket works . Right ? " It 's the Rockets , Stupid Apparently , not necessarily . NASA has an unavoidable bottleneck that might make a segmented , folding mirror preferable - the aging Atlas rocket . The Atlas , designed to deliver nuclear bombs to enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Atlas , like other United States rockets , limits telescope diameters to 3.5 meters ( 11.5 feet ) . NASA considers the nation 's largest rocket , the Titan , too expensive for the NGST . Even the shuttle , which hoisted Hubble and its 2.4-meter mirror , ca n't handle a telescope significantly larger than 3.5 meters . " There is no vehicle presently planned that has an inside diameter bigger than about 4.5 meters , " said Mather . " Clearly , a mirror that fits inside it must be significantly smaller . Hence , without a folding mirror there is no hope for a telescope a lot bigger than Hubble . " " That is why the United States is such a small player in the commercial satellite-launch business  --  because we do n't have the rockets , " says Angel . " Well , my view is , It 's the rockets , stupid ; right ? " A frustrated Angel has grudgingly altered his NGSTmirror design . It is a segmented version of his original prototype . But he is not happy about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise for ferrying the much larger space telescopes of the future . Ariane rockets were developed by several European countries specifically as satellite-launch vehicles . The European consortium has spent roughly $7.3 billion to develop the Ariane . The largest Arianes are 4.5 to 5 meters in diameter , but Angel argues that bigger ones could be developed that might accommodate a six-meter mirror . " Nobody has ever launched a rocket that big , " Mather says . " So that would also be a development item , which is not something I think is a low-risk item . " In other words , Mather does n't like Angel 's idea . Indeed , a newly developed Ariane 5 exploded in June shortly after launch from French Guiana while carrying scientific satellites . It bruised Arianespace , the European Space Agency 's commercial satellite launching arm . At the same time , smaller Ariane rockets had been considered among the most reliable satellite-launch vehicles . " I would not like to be the guinea pig that was the first to fly on a new rocket , " says Mather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a lot less than the satellites that are carried by them . In the end , Roger 's design may not be the right choice . What we choose for NGST may depend on factors other than how good the mirror is . " Photograph ABOVE : LEFT : // <p>
