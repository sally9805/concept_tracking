Not by bureaucratic or military design but by spontaneous human action , Japan is remaking the face of Asia . The question is : Where are the Americans ? <p> THE PHOTOGRAPH Of Hong Kong to the right says a lot about hat is happening throughout the booming western Pacific countries today . Increasingly , the dominant players are Japanese businessmen , supported by their counterparts in South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore . In the picture and in the region , it is getting harder to find American interests . <p> Travel southwest 1,600 miles from Hong Kong to the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia 's sultry capital . There , Matsushita Television Co. of Malaysia 's gleaming new factory has been carved out of an old oil-palm plantation . The conveyor belts and insertion robots are shipped in from the consumer electronics giant 's regional technical center in Singapore ; the television designs and production schedules are sent to the 1-million-unit-a-year plant by computer from Osaka . Charts on the wall proclaim that components produced locally will rise from representing 47% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1993 . <p> Kensuke Yokoo , sent by Matsushita to manage the plant , pauses at a pile of crates containing a shipment of 14-inch color TVs . Are they destined for the U.S. market , to add to our balance-of-trade woes ? No . They are on their way to Japan , to help balance Malaysia 's deficit with Japan and provide a higher standard of living not only for the Malaysians working in the plant , but also for Japanese consumers who want high-quality , low-cost television sets . <p> " Matsushita learned much about quality control and industrial engineering from the U.S. , " says Yokoo , without a trace of irony . " It 's time we transferred these skills to Malaysia and surrounding countries in order to make them prosperous . " <p> Asia 's economies are transforming themselves so rapidly it 's hard even for new Asia hands to keep up . But some broad trends are now becoming clear . An Asian trade bloc is rapidly developing . Intra-Asian trade is booming . Less and less do the Asian nations  --  from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to European or North American markets . <p> Disturbingly , American business is playing a diminishing role in this epochal economic transformation . In the four years from 1986 through 1989 , for example , U.S. companies invested about $3 billion in three of the most rapidly developing Asian countries : Malaysia , Thailand and Indonesia , which among them have a population of 250 million . Over the same period Japan invested $11 billion in the same three countries . And Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore-Asia 's so-called NICS , or newly industrialized countries  --  invested over $8 billion in the three . <p> " The U.S. is receding into the background , " warns Miron Mushkat , chief regional economist of Baring Securities ( Hong Kong ) . " It 's not keeping pace with the more aggressive players in this region , like Japan and Taiwan . " <p> America 's diminished presence , if it continues at its present level , has implications for the global competitiveness of U.S. corporations . The western Pacific region is the fastest-growing market for everything from cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The regional market for steel , for example , will be bigger than that of the U.S. and the European Community  --  combined  --  by the turn of the decade . <p> Wherever one goes in Asia these days , the pulsing economic vigor is palpable . Next door to Matsushita 's Kuala Lumpur TV plant , workers are putting the finishing touches on one of the world 's largest air-conditioner factories . Matsushita will export 80% of the air conditioners back to Japan . A Malaysian manager predicts that the plant will help the developing country become the world 's biggest exporter of air conditioners next year , displacing Japan . <p> In the adjacent lot , ground is being broken for a cathode-ray tube plant to replace imports from Japan and to supply Matsushita 's TV assembly plants in Malaysia , Thailand , Indonesia and the Philippines . <p> Investments such as these are integrating Asia into Japan 's production base . Significantly , the investment flows emanating from Japan are not the work of the Ministry of International Trade &; Industry 's visible bureaucratic hand , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spontaneously created one , not an artificially constructed one . <p> " Thousands upon thousands of microeconomic decisions by Japanese corporations are creating a common market , " explains Kenneth Courtis , senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets ( Asia ) . Adds Sanjoy Chowdhury , chief economist for Asia at Merrill Lynch ( Singapore ) , " Asian economic integration is largely driven by economic and business logic , not by governments as in the European common market . " <p> The heart of this emerging , informal western Pacific economic sphere is a region , with 600 million people , that includes Japan , the newly industrialized countries , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  --  Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia and the Philippines ( ASEAN for short ) Band the coastal Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian . Some economists expect Vietnam and more of China 's regions inevitably to be pulled into this market-induced economic community in the Nineties . <p> It used to be that Asian economies depended for growth on exports to the great U.S. market . Increasingly , they depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the percentage of the region 's trade that is intra-Asian rose from 34% in 1986 to 42% last year ( see chart , p. 157 ) . Nomura projects the percentage will reach 55% by the year 2000 . The region now exports more to itself than to North America , and the gap is growing quickly . <p> " It 's the end of the era in which the U.S. or the European Community could fantasize about cutting off Asia 's economic takeoff by cutting them off from the U.S. and European markets , " asserts William Overholt , regional strategist at Bankers Trust Securities ( Pacific ) . " Asia is feeding on Asia now . " <p> In a sense , Asians can thank Secretary of State James Baker for their accumulating prosperity . Asia 's economic transformation was touched off by a chain reaction stemming from currency realignment . After Baker , then Treasury Secretary , orchestrated the Plaza Accord in September 1985 , the yen , then trading at around 240 on the dollar , began its sharp ascent ; off its peak , the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the Plaza Accord , Japanese manufacturers had no choice but to quickly move production to Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore to cut costs . This , in turn , contributed to an economic boom in 1986-88 that caused inflation in land and labor costs and sharp appreciation of the Taiwan dollar , Korean won and Singapore dollar . Suddenly , the newly industrialized countries , too , had to invest beyond their shores . <p> For the past few years , Japan and the NICS have invested massively in factories in the countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , as well as in coastal China . Japan continued to invest heavily in the NICS , but shifted into real estate , banking and service industries such as hotels and retailing . Japanese direct investment in Asia jumped sixfold , to $8.2 billion , in 1989 , and Japan is now the leading investor in almost every country in the region . <p> As Asia transforms itself , rather well-defined economic subregions have emerged . Hong Kong has moved much of its labor-intensive industry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now five times the average in China and the Hong Kong dollar is commonly used as currency . Taiwanese manufacturers have shifted low-value-added production across the Taiwan Straits to Fujian Province and set up hundreds of factories in Southeast Asia , often with overseas Chinese partners . <p> Korea 's aggressive businessmen are starting to invest in northeast China . Singapore is developing a " Growth Triangle " with the southern Malaysian state of Johor and the Indonesian islands of Batam and Bintan , and relocating labor-intensive processes to its less developed neighbors . Thailand is already eyeing Vietnam as its low-cost hinterland . <p> Recently , however , a much more horizontal division of labor has developed . Japan , for instance , has become a huge market for garments , sporting goods , watches , calculators , radio cassettes and processed food . Two-way trade has boomed between Japan and the NICS , between Japan and ASEAN , between the NICS and ASEAN , and among the NICS . <p> Economists expect this deepening intensity of trade and investment ties to help sustain high economic growth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consumer markets . Nomura Research , for instance , projects that the western Pacific economy will be bigger than the European Community 's by the year 2000 and the same size as North America 's . Nomura thinks ASEAN , the NICS and China can sustain average annual compounded growth of 7% through the decade . <p> How are U.S. corporations doing in these burgeoning markets ? With some notable exceptions , they are not doing very well . <p> In general , the American companies that have done well in Asia arrived early and made long-term corporate commitments .. Like their Japanese competitors , they tailor products to markets , think globally , are successful on other continents and are run quite independently of U.S. headquarters . Interestingly , many of the U.S. companies most successful in Southeast Asia are also successful in Japan . Among these are IBM , Coca-Cola , Amway , Johnson &; Johnson , Procter &; Gamble , Clinique and Motorola . Two companies that recently announced major new commitments of resources in both Japan and Southeast Asia are Apple Computer and Compaq . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia is the car industry . Southeast Asia 's auto market is growing explosively , expanding 20% to 30% m each of the past three years . Deutsche Bank 's Courtis estimates the region 's market will triple this decade , to 7 million autos , producing a much bigger net increase in units than in North America . <p> The Southeast Asian car markets were small until recently . Most of the countries maintain barriers to imports of already built cars , but the Japanese were willing to build relatively inefficient assembly plants , and now dominate markets that are getting big . The Japanese carmakers have a combined market share of over 80% in each country . <p> Detroit ? The Big Three are preoccupied at home competing with the Japanese carmakers and have given the Japanese a free hand in Asia . The U.S. companies are weak in small-car technology , and the Asian markets are dominated by small cars . ( Ford does well in Taiwan , where it has a plant but mostly sells Mazda designs ; GM produces cars in Korea in a joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapidly growing Southeast Asian car markets . <p> " Asia will be Japan 's trump card in the car industry in the 1990s , " predicts Courtis . " Toyota will be able to squeeze margins in the U.S. and Europe and remain profitable later in the 1990s because of all the new volume they 're getting in Asia . " <p> Do the Japanese mind that many of their traditional industries are leaving for Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia ? Ken Iijima , executive director of Mitsui Research Institute 's Center for Pacific Business Studies , does n't show much concern . " Industries like radios , cameras and small TVs should be passed on to Asian countries , while Japan moves on to higher technology , " he says . For instance , while Matsushita is moving production of small color TV sets to Malaysia , it is cranking up production of large-screen and broadcast-satellite TV sets at home and developing high-definition television technology . <p> The Japanese are well aware that investments in ASEAN not only help their manufacturers gain a share of a burgeoning market but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , commodity-based economies . By helping its western Pacific neighbors develop , Japan helps itself by reducing its dependence on the potentially protectionist North American and European markets . <p> " Investment from Japan is encouraging the creation of a middle class in Southeast Asia , " says Hirotaka Tsurusa , a manager in the Asian division of Toyota Motor . " We have to expand their domestic markets by building factories and transferring skills . This will help Toyota 's overall market grow . " Enlightened self-interest , in short , is the name of the game . <p> The changing nature of Japanese investments owes much to a remarkable shift in economic policies in ASEAN over the past few years . Stung by the failure of their import substitution strategies and inspired by the success of outward-looking Korea , Taiwan , Singapore and Hong Kong , ASEAN governments have deregulated their economies , privatized state enterprises , liberalized foreign exchange and foreign investment controls and reduced trade barriers . They have competed aggressively with one another in courting export-oriented foreign investments by offering perks like tax holidays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by permitting 100% foreign ownership . <p> Rafidah Aziz , Malaysia 's Minister of Trade &; Industry , explains why her country laid out the welcome mat for foreign investors . " We had to do something urgently to boost growth , " she says . " We realized we must diversify the industrial base . " Are you listening , Mikhail Gorbachev ? <p> Now the turn to market forces is paying off . Rich in petroleum , rubber , tin and palm oil , Malaysia 's manufacturing sector has been buoyed by $2 billion of direct investment from Japan and the NICS since 1986 . The share of manufactured goods in Malaysia 's exports has jumped from 30% to 54% of a much larger pie since the early 1980s . The economy has expanded at least 8% a year for three consecutive years . With higher oil prices kicking in , it may now be the world 's fastest-growing economy . <p> Not by design but by spontaneous action , Japan 's investments in ASEAN are increasingly integrated and complementary across borders . Japanese electronics companies , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologically advanced Singapore . They then ship these to assembly . plants in areas with cheaper labor , such as Malaysia and Thailand . Japanese manufacturers call this linked regional production strategy their " network production system . " <p> Singapore , playing on its superb infrastructure and skilled work force , has sought to profit from the regional production strategies of Japanese corporations . The city-state offers tax and other incentives to companies that site their regional headquarters and functions such as marketing , finance , research and development , design and parts procurement in Singapore . " The region is moving toward economic integration , driven by the strategies of Japanese companies , " explains Chua Taik Him , counselor for industry in Singapore 's embassy in Tokyo . In other words , if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em . <p> There is rich historical irony in Japanese corporations ' integrating the ASEAN economies . Originally a political group formed in 1967 to counter Vietnam 's aggressions , ASEAN has attempted economic cooperation among its often contentious members for 20 years , with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost comical failure because governments have zealously guarded their own domestic producers . <p> But now companies like Toyota and Mitsubishi Motors are succeeding where ASEAN governments failed . Toyota , for instance , developed a light utility vehicle in Indonesia that it exports to Taiwan . <p> Toyota also worked out a $215 million ( investment ) complementary parts scheme with ASEAN governments . It works this way : Toyota will build steering links and export them from Malaysia to Thailand , Indonesia and the Philippines . It ships transmissions from the Philippines to Indonesia and Malaysia . It sends electrical equipment from Thailand to Malaysia and the Philippines , and diesel engines from Thailand to Malaysia . At the end of the chain are cars , the value of which has been created in several countries whose governments have rarely been able to get along . <p> Quips Mark Michelson , vice president of Hong Kong-based Business International ( Asia/Pacific ) , about Japanese companies : " They 're making ASEAN work without ASEAN . " <p> As in cars , so in other industries . Toray Industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor in Southeast Asia , with 20 factories . But the projects have shifted recently from import-substitution mills aimed at domestic markets to modern , export-oriented plants integrated into Toray 's global trading strategy . <p> For . example , the company just installed 500 advanced air-jet looms in its plant in Penang , Malaysia . The fabric used there is imported from Toray 's plant in Surabaya , Indonesia ; the output is shipped to garment-makers in Singapore and Hong Kong , who export to world markets . Meanwhile , at home , Toray concentrates on high-value-added products like carbon fiber and synthetic silk and mink . <p> " We do n't see any growth in the Japanese textile industry , " explains Kohei Sakamoto , Toray 's executive vice president . " The expansion is in Southeast Asia . If we combine these operations with Japan , we can build the most efficient operation to meet world demand . " <p> Probably the most sophisticated " network production system " of all is Matsushita 's . With 28 factories in Asia , not including Japan , and annual production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 80% of that production sold in Asia  --  the maker of National , Panasonic and Technics brand goods is sinking deep roots . <p> In Singapore alone , for example , Matsushita opened an R &D; laboratory , a training center for managers and technical staff from around the region and a technical center to produce robots , dies and molds and computer software for the company 's network of factories . With demand for consumer durables expanding enormously around Southeast Asia , Matsushita is also sending 1,000 workers a year to Japan for training . <p> " Japan is trying to remake Asia in its own image , " explains Ranjan Pal , director of forecasting services at Business International ( Asia/Pacific ) . " You can put any kind of face on it , but the Asians are being integrated into Japan 's economy . " <p> How do Asians feel about this growing Japanese influence ? The job creation , technology transfer and foreign exchange earnings generated by Japanese investment are , of course , welcomed . But some are wary of Japanese intentions . Older Asians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co-Prosperity Sphere created in the 1930s ; this was Japan 's attempt to impose an economic order on its Asian neighbors through military means . <p> " Essentially what they 're doing now is reviving the Co-Prosperity Sphere without the hideous means , " argues Ismail Muhd Salleh , an economist at Malaysia 's Institute of Strategic &; International Studies . Like many Asians , he laments the decline of U.S. economic influence and the lack of balance in this emerging western Pacific economic community . " We do need the Japanese for the investments  --  that 's the dilemma faced by these countries , " he says . " People are beginning to accept that Japan is going to be the dominant power in the region . I do n't think we can resist it . We can only position ourselves to take the best advantage of it . " <p> Japanese businessmen today naturally recoil from the Co-Prosperity Sphere comparison . They prefer to use a new metaphor to describe Asia 's new economic realities : a V-shaped formation of flying geese in which Japan is the lead goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong ; which are followed by the ASEAN countries ; and with China bringing up the rear . That there are no American geese in , this image should disturb anyone interested in the long-term prospects for U.S. business in the global economy . <p> " In the Sixties and Seventies , you needed a position in North America and Europe , " says Deutsche Bank 's Courtis . " In the Nineties and after 2000 , you will need a solid competitive position in Japan and East Asia to remain globally competitive . Any other strategy is a program for decline and defeat . " Trade patterns <p> The 1985 Plaza Accord touched off momentous changes in Asia 's trade patterns . Japan and Asia 's newly industrialized countries have dramatically reduced their export dependence on the U.S. , while rapidly boosting their shipments to Asian trade partners . The percentage of intra-Asian trade has surged during this period . <p> GRAPH : RATIO OF EXPORT DEPENDENCE ON U.S. MARKET <p> GRAPH : RATIO OF EXPORT DEPENDENCE ON ASIAN MARKET <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Japanese logos towering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Japanese and Malaysian workers in a Matsushita factory " It 's time we transferred these skills .
