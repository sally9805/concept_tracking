<p> This country is in shackles , its thought , character and public policy locked in distortion and lies . The deceit stands at the root of Federal and state budgetary chaos and corrodes every aspect of national life . It causes the chief executive to expatiate on the defense of " our life style " - our life style - as though the way of life of the privileged were universal . And that obliviousness is but a minor symptom of a vast , country-wide self- deception . <p> Several hallowed concepts - independence , individualism , choice - are woven into the web of illusion and self-deception . But presiding over the whole is the icon of classlessness . <p> George Bush asserts that class is " for European democracies or something else - it is n't for the United States of America . We are not going to be divided by class . " The forces behind this icon of classlessness range from the media to the national experience of public education . <p> The myth of classlessness has a history , of course . Caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to impose land and property qualifications for Federal office ; and 8 out of 10 Americans , in the Depression , claimed to be middle class . In our time , the myth not only lives deep in people 's our nerves , but exerts an ever more destructive influence on public policy . <p> The myth is in tens of thousands of hours of sitcoms watched by tens of millions , young and old . On " The Cosby Show , " black Princeton grads win admission to the law and medical schools of their choice - then chuck it all , preferring to start at the bottom as busboys and waitresses . <p> On " Designing Women , " elegant , expensively coiffed Southern businesswomen talk for a second or two with striking curtain factory employees and at once become partisans of the strike : " We are all labor ! " the ladies cry . In the Harvard alumni magazine , a recent graduate genially avers that " we 're all working class . " <p> And the myth directly affects the distribution of privileges , bounties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , a Federal housing donation of close to $40 billion is awarded to millions earning more than $50,000 annually . The donation takes the form of tax abatements , such as the mortgage interest and property tax exemptions , and the capital gains deferral on housing sales . <p> The handout to these $50,000-plus neediest comes at a time when the fair market price of rental housing in all 50 states exceeds the means of families in which two wage-earners work full time for the minimum wage , and when New York City alone has 170,000 families on the waiting list for public housing . Only the faith that America is a classless society prevents this charity to the propertied from being recognized for what it is : an indefensible class ripoff . <p> And the myth of classlessness figures in corporate decisions that strip the workforce of its dignity and skills by killing off one industry after another , from steel to semiconductors . The assumption is that workers are n't shaped by their skills ; when quality jobs disappear , workers can just do - and be - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for a range of inequities stretching from regressive Social Security taxes to pauperization requirements for care for the disabled , from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh 's rejection of guidelines mandating prison terms for white collar criminals to the denial of proper medical care to heart disease patients lacking private insurance and wholly dependent on Medicare . <p> The Vietnam " draft , " the upper income " bubble , " tracking in the public schools , " vocational " education - all these episodes of state-administered injustice reflect the influence of the myth of classlessness . <p> And always that influence is masked , obscured , downplayed . Work-related accidents and illnesses kill 70,000 a year - but those people are nearly invisible . " Most occupational risks are blue collar , " says Peter Sandman , director of the Environmental Communication Research Program at Rutgers , " If most risks were professional level they 'd get more media coverage . " <p> Gov . James Florio dared to present a fresh , pertinent vision of New Jersey - a vision of a state prepared to acknowledge the realities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowing the gulf separating rich and poor . The protest against his program is strongest in the richest suburbs , but it has significant working class backing . How could it be otherwise , given the huge resources that have been poured into the campaign to persuade us that we 're all one , that each has access to all , that serious inequities simply do n't exist ? <p> An immense weight of subsidized opinion has gathered on the side of social untruth , and the means available to those who try to contend against the untruth are fragile . Social wrong is accepted because substantive , as opposed to sitcom , knowledge about class has been habitually suppressed , and the key mode of suppression remains the promotion of the idea of classlessness . <p> We shall not shake the monster in our midst until we take serious account of the idea of difference - differences between , for one more example , youngsters for whom opportunity means college and youngsters for whom opportunity can only mean the Army . The task is nothing less than that of laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social sameness and the perpetuation of social wrong . We have all too little time in which to get on with it .
