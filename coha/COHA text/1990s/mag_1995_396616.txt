SQUEEZED INTO A BOOTH IN A college hangout in Norman , Okla. , onetime gold medal gymnast Nadi Comaneci is giving fiancee Bart Conner the business . " If I focus on something and want it to happen , it happens , " she says , sliding him a knowing look , every bit the femme fatale in form-hugging jeans . " I knew that once you got caught , you would n't want to get out of it . " Conner , a former Olympic gymnast with his own pedigree  --  two golds in L.A. in 1984  --  is showing no signs of struggling . Even before their Nov. 12 engagement , when Conner surprised her with a 3.3-carat diamond ring at an Amsterdam hotel , the two had been inseparable  --  pairing up for gymnastic exhibitions , Jockey underwear ads and even a regular cable TV show , Food and Fitness . Next spring , after 4 2 years together , they 'll take it to the altar in Comaneci 's native Rumania . " She 's very passionate like her people , " says Conner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know what to expect with her . " Comaneci , 33 , says simply , " I think everything about him is good . " She should know . They shared their first kiss 19 years ago . It was March 1976 , and both were competing in the American Cup International gymnastics meet in New York City . He was 18 and she was a wippet-thin , 83-pound 14-year-old . " We both won , " says Conner , " and after the meet we stood together and raised these big silver cups . Some photographer said , " Why do n't you lean down and give her a little kiss ? ' I did , and it ran in the paper the next day . " For Conner , the kiss remained sealed in memory . Comaneci , though , never gave it a second thought . Her life was already filled with attention . Raised in Onesti , Rumania , she was discovered at age 6 by her renowned countryman , coach Bela Karolyi , who recognized her worldclass potential . At 14 ( four months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1976 games in Montreal , scoring the first-ever perfect 10s and taking golds in the all-around and on the uneven bars and the balance beam . Though her father , Ghorghe , an auto mechanic , and her mother , Stefania , divorced a year later , she struggled on to another triumph in Moscow in 1980 . Then at 19 , reaching the end of her competitive career , she quit . Shortly afterward , it was said she had an affair with Nicu Ceausescu  --  son of the Rumanian dictator  --  though she denies it . She eventually took a government coaching post and  --  prohibited from traveling to the West because she was considered too valuable to let slip away  --  languished in frustrated obscurity until 1989 . That year she chose her own way out . ( " I used to say I 'd rather die in a free country than die in a Communist one , " she says . ) She walked six hours in darkness to cross the Hungarian border , where Rumanian emigre Constantin Panait , then 38 , a Florida roofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Panait brought her  --  via Vienna  --  to the United States . For a time , exposure to the West worked a garish transformation on Comaneci 's lithe , gamine beauty . Traveling with Panait across the U.S. and living out of motel rooms , she began turning up in public overweight , in heavy makeup and stiletto heels . Her reputation suffered a similar reversal . It was widely assumed that she and Panait , who was married with four children , were lovers  --  though she now claims that was not true . Instead , she Says , she was a virtual hostage to Panait  --  who pocketed her fees from performances and m interviews and threatened her with deportation if she exposed him . " I do not feel good about all that , " she says . " That was not me . " Comaneci 's troubles did not go unnoticed in the tight-knit gymnastic community . " We saw the travesty she was going through , " says Conner , who had parlayed his gold medals into a lucrative endorsement career and who had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1981 . Former Rumanian rugby coach Alexandru Stefu  --  living in Montreal  --  also saw the trouble . In 1990 , in an elaborate scheme involving the promise of a big payday for Comaneci , Stefu lured Panait and Comaneci to a meeting . There , Comaneci acknowledged that Panait was mistreating her . Realizing the jig was up , Panait fled . Stefu and his wife then took Comaneci into their home , where she lived for 18 months while she trimmed down and shaped up . When Stefu died in a snorkling accident , Comaneci turned to Conner 's coach Paul Ziert  --  who had arranged her gymnastics shows  --  and a room in his Norman home . She Conner had already performed a number of exhibitions together , but now ' the pace heated up  --  and so did their relationship . In November , five years after her escape from Rumania , Comaneci returned with Conner for a visit and , en route , he proposed . " I said " No , ' ' " Comaneci reminds him . " I could n't believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she changed her mind a few minutes later . " You grow up with the idea you 'll marry an American girl , " says Conner , who was raised in the Chicago suburb of Morton Grove , Ill. , the second of three sons of Harold Conner , director of the School of Construction Science at the University of Oklahoma  --  which Bart attended on a gymnastics scholarship  --  and his then wife , Jackie , who is now remarried and lives in Chicago . " It 's quite different when you open your heart and mind to a different culture . " In July 1993 , Conner and Comaneci moved into a custom-built home in Norman , and with the Bart Conner Gymnastics Academy  --  opened two years ago  --  they have helped turn their town into a hotbed of gymnastics . More than 1,000 students ( mostly grade-school kids ) use the academy . And Conner plans to move the California-based International Gymnast magazine , which he co-owns , to Norman . The couple hopes to have children within the next few years . " They 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Comaneci , who works out with Conner roughly an hour a day to stay tuned for occasional exhibitions . But Conner does n't plan to push them . " If they want to be gymnasts , great . But if they do gymnastics just for fun , that would n't bother me at all . " It would , of course , do considerable damage to his faith in genetics .
