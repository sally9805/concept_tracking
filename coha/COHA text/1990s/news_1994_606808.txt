<p> Not long after Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Neil O'Donnell had finished a postgame interview early Sunday evening in Three Rivers Stadium , he rounded a corner and bumped into Ron Erhardt , his offensive coordinator . Both men were smiling and their warm hug spoke volumes about the affection and respect they have for each other . <p> But in this tough town , where every Steelers accomplishment in the 1990s is measured against the legendary four-time Super Bowl champion teams of the 1970s , the populace is still not quite ready to embrace O'Donnell . However , after an almost flawless , no-interception performance in Sunday 's emotional 17-7 victory over the Cleveland Browns for the AFC Central title and the home field throughout the playoffs , perhaps they 'll give him a bit of slack for a couple of weeks . <p> " I do n't know if the pressure will ever be taken off me here , " O'Donnell , a five-year veteran from the University of Maryland , admitted after the game . " It 's been an up-and-down year for me personally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division . But the coaches stayed with me , and I tip my hat to them . " <p> And now , all of Pittsburgh is doing the same to the Steelers , 12-3 with seven straight victories going into Sunday 's game at San Diego and clearly the favorite to be the American Football Conference 's representative in the Super Bowl . Only one team , the 13-2 San Francisco 49ers , has a better record this season , and despite all the talk around the country about the dominance of the 49ers and 12-3 Dallas Cowboys , to a man the Steelers believe they belong in those very same conversations . <p> " It really does n't make any difference what you do right now , " said Bill Cowher , the 36-year-old local boy now made very good as the team 's fiery head coach . " The bottom line is who wins that last game in late January . That 's the measuring stick you should go by . All those other things are just little steps along the way . " <p> Still , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now ranked No. 1 in total and pass defense in the NFL . They 've set a club record with 55 sacks , also best in the league , and linebacker Kevin Greene 's 14 sacks also sets the standard for every other pass rusher this year . <p> Different Kind of Defense <p> But unlike the Mean Joe Greene , " Steel Curtain " Steelers of the 1970s , this modern version has been holding teams down with a variety of blitzes from all portions of the field and occasionally employing six defensive backs . Linebacker Greg Lloyd can rush from the outside , or drop back into pass coverage ; cornerback Rod Woodson or safety Carnell Lake can come crashing toward the quarterback . <p> The bottom line is that teams have had a difficult time figuring out just when and where the Steelers are coming from in defensive coordinator Dom Capers 's scheme . While there has been some talk around the league that the Steelers are relying on gimmickry to get it done , no one questions the results . Capers , suddenly this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible candidate for the head coaching job of the expansion Carolina Panthers next year . <p> Still , the week before the Cleveland game , several members of the Browns  --  not to mention other NFL coaches  --  were openly scornful of the Steelers defense . <p> " They 're having a lot of success with it now , " said Cleveland defensive end Rob Burnett . " It may not be this week and it may not be the week after , but my prediction is sooner or later , that style of defense is going to catch up to them . It 's going to be their end . " <p> " The Steel Curtain never had to blitz , " Minnesota Vikings line coach John Teerlinck told the Cleveland Plain Dealer last week . " This is trick ' em , fool ' em , guys flying through the air and jumping up high . " <p> The Steelers love to hear that sort of talk . <p> " There 's a lot of crap coming our way that we do it all with mirrors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair and a style of play that 's way beyond reckless abandon . " It just motivates us to get in their face . " <p> Greg Lloyd , his bookend , plays the game in full rage as well . Against the Browns , Lloyd had to be helped off the field three times with various injuries . And three times , he returned to the field . <p> " You throw your body around out there and you pay a price for it , " he said afterward , not long after someone asked him , " Where does n't it hurt ? " <p> " All I know is this defense has done the job all year , " said cornerback Tim McKyer , who started in Super Bowl XXIII for the 49ers at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami  --  where Super Bowl XXIX will be played next month . " Hey , that 's right , de'ja ' vu for me going back to Joe Robbie and maybe playing against them too . That would be nice . <p> " I 'll take my chances on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or better than any defense I 've ever been part of . It 's a calculating defense , the guys are tough and hard-nosed . Every time we need a play , someone comes up and makes it . We 're close , we do n't get down on each other , we hang out together and we keep things in the locker room where they 're supposed to be . " <p> Then and Now <p> Myron Cope , the radio voice of the Steelers since 1970 and the man who spawned all those waving yellow " Terrible Towels " in the stands back in the glory years , is constantly being asked to compare this year 's team to the old Steelers . <p> " The defense plays a very different style than the defense of the ' 70s , " he said . " But this defense , in terms of results , is every bit as good with the possible exception of 1976 , and that team did was just like the ' 70s , the atmosphere all over the city , the crowd at the stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the towels back for special occasions . This was a special occasion . " <p> For a change , the crowd even jumped on the bandwagon for the Steelers offense , which has struggled at times this season . Fans have been particularly hard on O'Donnell , now in his fourth year as a starter , for throwing nine interceptions in his first 10 games . Cowher was also seen several times on nationally televised games giving his quarterback a piece of his mind from the sideline for holding on to the ball too long or missing open receivers . <p> O'Donnell played several games with ankle and hip injuries until Cowher sat him down for two starts , replacing him with veteran backup Mike Tomczak . Tomczak won both those games and played well , and many fans were stunned when Cowher gave the job back to O'Donnell when he recovered . <p> " He told me when I was hurt that when I got healthy , it 's your job , " O'Donnell said . " I appreciated that . " <p> The Balanced Offense <p> The Steelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far more effective offense handing the football to their big-back trio of Barry Foster , rookie Bam Morris and John L. Williams , the team 's leading receiver with 51 catches . Wideouts Yancey Thigpen and rookie Charles Johnson remind no one of former stars Lynn Swann or John Stallworth , but 280-pound tight end Eric Green could excel in any era . <p> But this is the here and now , and that 's what concerns Cowher , a one-time nondescript linebacker for the Browns best known for his wild-eyed play on special team . He is still an exciteable fellow , and admitted he was particularly turned on the week before the Cleveland game . <p> " For the first time , for six days , all you heard about here was football , " he said on Monday . " You heard about , ' You ca n't beat the blitz ' or ' Our city is better than your city . ' That was the greatest thing about the game . ... That 's why we 're in this business . I think it 's fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The greatest thing about it is we get to do it again when the playoffs come . ... This has been enjoyable . We 've played in some big games . We 've won some close games . But the thing 's not over yet . The time to sit back and reflect is February .
