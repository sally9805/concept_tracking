Most people have good intentions when it comes to their health and fitness . Surveys clearly show that the vast majority of adults are not satisfied with their present physical status and would like to make improvements . For a number of reasons , however , most of us never really " walk our talk . " Seven of every 10 adults fall short of meeting even minimal activity requirements . Nearly one in four is a total couch potato . As a nation we are fatter and less fit than ever before . To make matters worse , our kids seem to be following the same path . Ironically the so-called " fitness revolution " may be contributing to the problem . With lots of money to be made in the diet and exercise industry , a great deal of information and misinformation has been dumped on the general public . Separating fact from fiction poses a difficult dilemma , even for the experienced exerciser . As the saying goes , " knowledge is power , " so the first step we must take is to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness goals we set for ourselves if we know what to do and , more importantly , we are willing to do it . The following questions are designed to test your Fitness I.Q. The quiz touches on issues I 've written about over the past couple of years . Correct answers are provided at the end of the test . 1 ) When it comes to losing weight , if an exercise is n't aerobic it is n't worth doing . a . True b .

False 5 ) The preferred method of maintaining and improving flexibility is static stretching exercises . a . True b . False 6 ) Wearing an exercise suit made of vinyl or rubber will speed up fat loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop bigger muscles you should increase your intake of protein . a . True b . False 8 ) Aerobic exercise in frigid temperatures does not cause lung damage . a . True b . False 9 ) Regular exercise is beneficial for young and middle aged adults , but the risks outweigh the benefits for elderly adults who have n't exercised in years . a . True b . False 10 ) Doing sit-ups and abdominal crunches is an excellent way to get rid of the excess fat ( spare tire ) around your midsection. a . True b . False 11 ) Exercise has got to be intense to be worthwhile  --  in other words " no pain , no gain ! " a . True b . False 12 ) When exercising to lose weight , the more I sweat , the more fat I will lose . a . True b . False 13 ) Women who lift weights will develop large , bulky muscles and lose flexibility . a . True b . False 14 ) Cellulite is a special type of fat that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True b . False 15 ) Loss of muscle mass is one of the primary reasons why men and women gain weight as they get older . a . True b . False CORRECT ANSWERS 1 ) False . Although the benefits of aerobic exercise are well documented , it is by no means the only form of exercise linked to long-term weight loss . Any increase in physical activity that burns calories will promote fat loss . A simple way to increase your energy output is to substitute active behaviors for passive ones . For example : * walk the stairs rather than ride the elevator * ride a bike for short errands rather than drive the car * wash your car by hand * cut the grass with a push mower rather than a riding mower 2 ) True . In general , a woman who is experiencing a normal pregnancy can and should continue to exercise . The potential benefits far outweigh the risks , if caution is taken in planning the program . The expectant mother should , in all cases , coordinate her exercise program with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate type of exercise , as well as defining limits for the frequency , intensity and duration of activity . 3 ) False . This belief is based upon a perception of the lean , muscular athlete who gradually turns into an overweight , middle-aged , has-been once the playing days have ended . To the casual observer it appears that muscle has turned into fat . In truth , muscle cells and fat cells are entirely distinct tissues . One can not change into the other . Muscles may atrophy and become smaller due to a lack of exercise , but they do n't turn into fat . The deposition of body fat is purely the result of taking in more energy ( calories ) than needed to fuel daily activities . 4 ) False . This notion has been around for a long time and is supported by the seemingly endless parade of spot-reducing devices currently on the market . Manufacturers base their claims on the premise that if you work a muscle hard enough , the fat around that muscle will gradually disappear . An appealing thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not selectively reduce fat stores , although you can selectively tone muscles . 5 ) True . Static stretching is preferred over ballistic , or bouncing , movements that can actually cause damage to muscles and connective tissues . To achieve maximum flexibility , assume the stretch position and slowly extend the target muscle(s) to the point of tightness but without discomfort . Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds , relax for a few moments , and then move into a deeper stretch for another 30 to 60 seconds . Do not bounce or jerk . 6 ) False . Although you may experience greater fluid ( sweat ) loss when wearing a rubber suit , it does not translate into greater fat loss . More importantly , vinyl and rubber exercise suits can cause dehydration and heat stroke because they prevent the body 's normal cooling mechanism ( evaporation of sweat ) from working properly . 7 ) False . The benefits of protein supplements have been greatly exaggerated . While it is true that protein plays an important role in the growth and repair of cells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dangerous to one 's health . Eating huge amounts of protein will not transform small , soft muscles into huge , well-defined muscles . Only strength training will do that . 8 ) True . Research indicates that even the coldest air warms up in the nose and throat before it enters the lungs . However , extremely cold air may cause dryness in the throat because the cold air is very dry and absorbs moisture from the respiratory passages . Although this is not dangerous , it can be irritating . 9 ) False . It 's never too late to start ! Regular exercise can make the elderly look and feel better and also improve the quality of their life . Even those who have never been exercisers , and who begin to exercise in their 50s , 60s and even 70s , can add years to their life and just as important , life to their years . 10 ) False . Doing 200 sit-ups a day will strengthen , tone , and tighten the abdominal muscles but it wo n't eliminate the fat covering those muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not one and the same . The only way to lose that extra layer of fat covering your stomach muscles is to create a " caloric deficit "  --  burn more calories than you consume over a given period of time . 11 ) False . With respect to health and longevity , intensity of exercise is not nearly as important as frequency . The federal government has recently joined with physical fitness organizations in urging sedentary Americans to adopt a " 30 minutes of moderate activity per day " program . Research suggests that virtually any type of physical activity of moderate intensity totaling 30 or more minutes per day , five or more days per week , can dramatically reduce the risk of death from heart disease , cancer , and other health-related causes . The activity need not be continuous . Ten minutes here , five minutes there , so long as it totals one-half hour of brisk activity per day . 12 ) False . The weight loss experienced immediately after heavy exercise is due primarily to fluid loss , not fat loss . One pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only way to lose one pound of fat is to expend 3500 calories above and beyond what is consumed through the foods and beverages that one eats and drinks . This caloric deficit can occur over a matter of days , weeks or even months  --  it is an additive process with a flexible time frame . In the final analysis , it is the number of calories burned during exercise , not how much fluid is lost through sweating , that determines how much fat a person will lose . 13 ) False . Women rarely , if ever , develop the bulky muscles that men do . Just the same , women will realize the many benefits of strength training such as improved muscle tone , greater strength , and increased bone density . 14 ) False . Cellulite is a term coined to describe fat that wrinkles and bulges out to create a waffle-like appearance . It usually appears on the hips , thighs or buttocks . Women seem to be more affected than men due to hormonal differences . From a scientific standpoint there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat that differs in appearance due to an increase in fat cell size . 15 ) True . Muscle cells are much more metabolically active than fat cells . Your metabolic motor will idle an a higher rate for every pound of muscle you gain . The calorie burning benefit is magnified because , when you raise your metabolism , the increase is multiplied by 24 hours per day , 365 days per year . It is easy to see that the more muscle you have , the more calories you burn , even at rest , and the easier it will be to maintain ideal weight over the long haul .
