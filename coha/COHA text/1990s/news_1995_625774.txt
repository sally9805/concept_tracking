<p> Right to protect flag ? <p> Regarding the Dec. 13 story , " " Senate rejects amendments to protect flag , " about the 63-36 Senate vote to reject a constitutional amendment to protect the flag from desecration : <p> It is a shame that 63 senators , including Sens . Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison , R-Texas , voted to desecrate the Constitution . <p> There ought to be a few things in life that are shielded from the crazies among us , and one of them needs to be the Bill of Rights . <p> Those who dishonor the First Amendment destroy its meaning and insult the memory of those who died defending our freedom . <p> Mark Garrett , Houston <p> After reading the Dec. 13 Chronicle , I ran up our flag in the pre-dawn dark to salute those brave 36 senators who voted to keep Old Glory flying over the land of the free . <p> Gruff old Samuel Johnson once tartly observed that " " Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel . " <p> That may put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Sen. Phil Gramm , R-Texas , labeling his opponents as " " crazies . " <p> Certainly Gramm found it easier and safer to vote for a flimsy flag amendment on a well-guarded Senate floor than to march in the military under that same flag by obtaining for himself a record number of student deferments . <p> John D.Craig , Bellaire <p> Keep that pork coming <p> It is with a significant degree of incredulity that I read U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen 's Dec. 12 Outlook article , " " Best - maybe only - hope for balanced budget . " <p> He wrote : " " It is fiscally irresponsible to cut taxes while the federal government continues to run deficits of $ 200 billion a year . " I must say , that paragraph needed to be reread a few times . <p> Upon further reading , I 'm considerably relieved to see his justification for ongoing spending is tied to local institutions . Keep that pork coming . <p> George H. Woodley , Sugar Land <p> Please , no more laws <p> Regarding the Dec. 12 editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method our government is pursuing to control the Internet : <p> Your suggestion that they search for alternatives that do not emasculate ( or erode ) our guarantee of inalienable rights is to be commended . In our Bill of Rights , first and foremost is the right of citizens to speak freely . <p> In what is becoming an archetypical strategy , Congress is proposing another oxymoronic body of law designed to control the uncontrollable by controlling the controllable , and to focus on the innocent tools used by criminals instead of their ( already illegal ) criminal activity . <p> The only historical result this strategy achieves is more rules , more lawyers , more government and increasing the need for more tax revenues . <p> In both civil and criminal actions , it has been repeatedly proven that we are already empowered to take action and secure restitution from individuals who are guilty of causing us harm . <p> And no matter what tools they employ , we do not require and do not need another law to do so . <p> J. A.Rogerson , Katy <p> Avert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad slays daughter mistaken for burglar " : <p> This incident was a tragedy that should remind us all of the need to become responsible gun owners . <p> The father in this case had recently bought the gun for family protection , admittedly disliked the idea , and had never fired a gun . Although many will try to blame the gun , education and responsible gun use will avert these sad incidents . <p> Gun education is easy to obtain . There are numerous books available . There are also many gun classes available . Gun education focuses not only on how to handle a gun safety and how to shoot , but also on when to shoot . <p> Will Blumentritt is co-chair of the Responsible Gun Owners of Houston <p> ' I choose neither ' <p> In her Dec. 6 column , Jane Ely has stepped up to her pulpit to berate those who choose not to vote . <p> She would favor a " " federal grant to teach Houstonians how and why to vote . " Ely and her ilk do n't get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnout on any level . <p> The truth is that millions of Americans view the vote as a meaningless joke . On the presidential level , the only viable candidates are well-to-do white men who owe their souls to the party line or else they never would have come so far . <p> Congressional candidates are beholden to the mountains of political action committee money without which they have no chance . <p> Local politicos are hand-chosen by businessmen whose wealth assures us that our elected officials will be beholden to one or more special interests . <p> The best person for the job is , thanks to our system , unelectable . That 's because the best person available would never jump through the hoops that are mandatory for acceptance in the world of politics . <p> Barry Goldwater has the situation down pat : " " Most politicians today are scumbags . " <p> It is for that reason , above all others , that so many of us refuse to be a part of this system . When the choice is the lesser of two evils , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a balance <p> Regardng Marguerite Hanselman 's Dec. 6 letter stating that she was offended by Jim Barlow 's Nov. 30 column , " " Environment 's science clouded " : She does n't see Barlow 's point . <p> He is calling for balance in the way education about the environment is handled . Hanselman 's reference to " " ruthless clear cutting in our national forests " indicates a mind set that is not willing to see any good in the oil or lumber industry . <p> Is she willing to let industry representatives present their side of the story , and let informed citizens make up their own minds ? <p> She is right that " " it does n't take a Ph.D . to cough on air pollution or taste pollutants in our water . " But it may take a Ph.D . or a good engineer to work out a way to get rid of them without other adverse effects to our quality of life . <p> We 're working on these problems , but not all of the scientists agree with Hanselman on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston <p> A fond farewell to Spec <p> Last week a Houston pioneer died : Carroll " " Spec " Jackson . <p> There was a small Dec. 5 story with a picture marking his passing . I would like to mention a few things about this fine man . <p> He was a leader in the beverage industry for years , having the first and only warehouse store . He was a leader in getting his competitors together to discuss their many problems . <p> He was a leader in lifting an industry from the depths of mediocrity to a fine upstanding part of our economy . He was also a leader in our community participating in all matters promoting our city . <p> Last , and certainly not least , he was a humanitarian , sharing his success with the less fortunate . <p> I am happy to have known him and called him my friend . <p> Sam Totah , Houston <p> A whole new inflection <p> " " Go Oilers " has a whole new inflection now . <p> That is , go to Nashville where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 30,000 fans in Houston who like the Oilers well enough to buy tickets .
