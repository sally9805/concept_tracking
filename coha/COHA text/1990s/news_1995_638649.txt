<p> FRANK BUSH <p> Linebackers <p> First season with Broncos , fourth in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : Houston Oilers ( 1992-94 ) <p> At 32 , Bush had hoped still to be playing linebacker in the NFL . Instead he finds himself coaching the position . He was a rising star as a rookie in 1985 - he had 114 tackles and four sacks , two of John Elway - before a spinal injury brought a premature end to his career . After retiring , he spent eight years with the Oilers as a scout and linebackers coach . He joined the Broncos after last season . Why ? Because of his relationship with defensive coordinator Greg Robinson , who successfully recruited Bush while he was an assistant coach at North Carolina State . <p> BARNEY CHAVOUS <p> Offensive line assistant <p> asst. strength and conditioning <p> Seventh season with Broncos and in NFL <p> If you 've followed the Broncos at all during the last two decades , Chavous needs no introduction . How long has he been around ? He started for the Broncos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defensive line in Super Bowl XXIX . Chavous , who joined the Broncos out of South Carolina State in 1973 , joined the staff as an intern in 1988 . He was assistant defensive line/assistant strength and conditioning coach until this year , when he moved across the line to assist Alex Gibbs with the offensive linemen . He was one of three coaches retained from Wade Phillips ' staff . <p> RICK DENNISON <p> Offensive assistant <p> First season with Broncos , first in NFL <p> Dennison , 37 , is one of three former Broncos players on Mike Shanahan 's staff , joining Barney Chavous and Gary Kubiak . He played linebacker from 1982-90 after joining the team as a free agent out of Colorado State . He joined the staff after contacting Shanahan and expressing an interest in getting into coaching . His main responsibility is compiling data on the Broncos ' offense . Dennison has a history of academic achievement in his family . He has a master 's degree in civil engineering from CSU , and his father , George , is president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First season with Broncos , sixth in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : New York Jets ( 1990-94 ) , Cal State Fullerton ( 1989 ) , Idaho ( 1986-88 ) , Pacific ( 1983-85 ) , Washington ( 1981-82 ) and Kent State ( 1979-80 ) <p> One of the first things Greg Robinson did after becoming the Broncos ' defensive coordinator was make sure Donatell would accompany him . Donatell coached the Jets ' defensive backs for the past five years before falling victim to owner Leon Hess ' staff-wide purge . In his last three years in New York , Jets DBs had a hand in 80 of the team 's 114 turnovers . They intercepted 17 last season , more than double the eight turned in by Broncos defensive backs in 1994 . Donatell , 38 , never played in the NFL . He was on the Washington staff in 1982 when the Huskies shut out Iowa , 28-0 , in the Rose Bowl . <p> GEORGE DYER <p> Defensive line <p> First season with Broncos , 14th in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Buffalo Bills ( 1982 ) , Arizona State ( 1980-81 ) , Michigan State ( 1977-79 ) , Winnipeg Blue Bombers ( 1974-76 ) , San Jose State ( 1973 ) , Idaho ( 1972 ) <p> At 55 , Dyer is the most experienced member of the Broncos ' staff , having coached at Buffalo , Seattle and Los Angeles , where for the past three seasons he served as Chuck Knox 's defensive coordinator . During his various stops , he has helped develop some of the league 's best defensive linemen , including Fred Smerlas , Jacob Green , Cortez Kennedy and Sean Gilbert . Dyer was the defensive line coach in Seattle in 1983 , when the Seahawks advanced to the AFC championship game for the only time in their history . He was considered for Broncos defensive coordinator before Robinson 's hiring . <p> ALEX GIBBS <p> Asst. head coach-offensive line <p> Second tenure with Broncos <p> 12th year in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : Kansas City Chiefs ( 1993-94 ) , Indianapolis Colts ( 1992 ) , San Diego Chargers ( 1990-91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broncos ( 1984-87 ) , Georgia Tech ( 1982-83 ) , Auburn ( 1979-81 ) , Ohio State ( 1975-78 ) , West Virginia ( 1973-74 ) , Kentucky ( 1971-72 ) , Duke ( 1969-70 ) <p> Mike Shanahan calls him the best offensive-line coach in the business , and it 's hard to argue . He has coached the offensive line for five NFL teams , and each time the teams ' sacks totals have dropped dramatically from the years before he arrived . In two seasons with the Chiefs , their sack totals went from 48 to a franchise-best 19 last season - with Joe Montana , not exactly a picture of mobility , at quarterback . Shanahan 's closest friend in the coaching fraternity , Gibbs is 54 going on 39 . He hand-picked the Broncos ' offensive line , bringing in players who had worked with him during other coaching stops . <p> MIKE HEIMERDINGER <p> Wide receivers <p> First season with Broncos , first in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : Duke ( 1994 ) , Rice ( 1989-93 ) , Cal State Fullerton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State ( 1982 ) , Air Force ( 1981 ) , Florida ( 1980 ) <p> Heimerdinger , 42 , is a rookie NFL assistant after 15 years in the college ranks .

While at Indiana State , he served as assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator from 1990-92 . During his tenure at ISU , he helped develop long-time NFL defensive back Vencie Glenn . From the it's-a-small-world dept. , Reynolds was hired to coach defensive backs at ISU when another Broncos assistant , Bobby Turner , left the school to become running backs coach at Fresno State . Reynolds , 36 , assists Ed Donatell in coaching the Denver defensive backs . <p> GREG ROBINSON <p> Defensive coordinator <p> First year with Broncos , sixth in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : New York Jets ( 1990-94 ) , UCLA ( 1982-89 ) , North Carolina State ( 1980-81 ) , Cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Robinson was fired in New York after one season as defensive coordinator . Now he faces his biggest challenge as an NFL assistant - resurrecting the league 's worst defense . His history indicates that the Denver defense is in good hands . During his last four seasons in New York - he was defensive-line coach from 1990-93 - the Jets forced 151 turnovers , more than any other AFC team during the period . Amazingly , his Jets defense forced 32 turnovers in the team 's final 11 games last season - more than the Broncos generated for the entire season . Robinson employs a blitzing style of defense , putting pressure on cornerbacks to cover receivers in one-on-one situations . <p> GREG SAPORTA <p> Administrative assistant <p> Strength and conditioning <p> First season with Broncos , first in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : Florida ( 1981-87 ) , North Carolina ( 1988-92 ) , Florida ( 1992-95 ) <p> Saporta , 38 , finds himself in a familiar position this year - assisting Rich Tuten in the weight room .

He has spent most of his 14 years in the business in Gainesville , where he has assisted Tuten with the Florida weight program . When he left the school , it was to join Tuten at North Carolina . Sure enough , when Tuten returned to Florida for the 1993-94 seasons , Saporta followed . Not surprisingly , he and Tuten joined the Broncos as a package deal . <p> RICHARD SMITH <p> Special teams <p> Third season with Broncos , eighth in NFL <p> Previous coaching stops : Houston Oilers ( 1988-92 ) , Arizona ( 1987 ) , California ( 1984-86 ) , Cal State Fullerton ( 1981-83 ) , Rio Hondo ( Calif . ) JC ( 1979-80 ) <p> That booming , raspy voice that could be heard in downtown Greeley during training camp belongs to Smith , one of the Broncos ' most demonstrative coaches . Smith coached the special teams with the Oilers , and also assisted at several positions - offensive line ( 1992 ) , linebackers ( 1990-91 ) and tight ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a then-NFL record five kicks . The Broncos ' special-teams play has been solid under Smith .

At Purdue , the Boilermakers ' running attack improved to 12th nationally from 106th during his tenure .

John Elway credits Tuten 's training program for helping him get in the best shape he 's ever been in . Tuten , like Mike Heimerdinger and Greg Saporta , was on the Florida staff in the early-mid ' 80s when Mike Shanahan was the Gators offensive coordinator . While he earns his living in the weight room , Tuten also played football . He was a starting nose guard at Clemson in the late 1970s . At Florida , his title was director of strength and conditioning for every sport in the athletic department . <p> - Jim Armstrong
