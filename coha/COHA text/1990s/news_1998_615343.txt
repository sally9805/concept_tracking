<p> AirTran Airways offers low fares and service basically indistinguishable from that of a big carrier . It has a zippy ad campaign and a generous frequent flier program . <p> What it does n't have are enough passengers or profits . <p> The Orlando-based discounter , Atlanta 's second-biggest carrier , was among the few U.S. airlines of any size that lost money in the summer quarter . <p> The surprising third-quarter loss , which came amid ideal conditions of high travel demand and low fuel prices , dashed earlier indications that AirTran was on the verge of consistent profitability . <p> Now the question is not just when , but if , the airline will ever achieve that goal . <p> Chief Executive D. Joseph Corr calls the loss a temporary setback caused by unusual costs and the government 's refusal to police unfair price competition by big carriers . <p> In an interview this week , he said fourth-quarter results will be close to break-even , owing to declining costs and fall route changes that shift AirTran 's focus even more heavily to Atlanta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosting both ridership and per-passenger revenue , and he added the airline still plans to begin acquiring new Boeing 717s next year . <p> " Everything we do seems to work ... the rebranding , going after weekday travelers . It 's all working . All we really are is short a couple of load factor points , " said Corr , referring to the percentage of seats sold . Hired to guide recovery Corr was hired in 1996 to take over ValuJet Airlines ' effort to recover from the shutdown that followed the Flight 592 crash that year . One year ago he led ValuJet into a name-changing merger with AirTran , coupled with a service and marketing overhaul that included the addition of business-class sections and other changes . Company headquarters were moved from Atlanta to Orlando . <p> " We run a very competitive product , have nice clean airplanes and good on-time and reliability rates , " Corr said . " If we can continue to build loads at the rate we have , I see no reason we ca n't be profitable long-term . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up from a year earlier but still well below load factors posted by larger airlines . Atlanta-based Delta , AirTran 's biggest competitor , filled 71 percent . <p> Analysts who follow AirTran and its low-flying stock , which hovers around $ 3 a share , are n't encouraged . <p> " Conditions have been so good for the last few months , " said Ed Starkman of Warburg Dillon Read . " Even as the second guy in Atlanta sweeping up the crumbs from Delta , you should be able to do very well . The fact they did n't is worrisome . " <p> James Parker of Robinson-Humphrey expects another loss in the fourth quarter and says the outlook for 1999 " is very uncertain . " <p> AirTran logged its first post-merger profit in the spring quarter . Corr predicted then that it would be " solidly profitable " for the full year . <p> But rather than gain momentum in the summer , AirTran posted a $ 10.9 million loss for the July-September quarter , laid off workers and made plans to return two of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly optimistic , " Corr said . " If you do what I do you just get mad and work harder . " <p> As the poor summer results emerged , Corr moved to ditch the remnants of the original AirTran 's Orlando-based route system and add flights to the old ValuJet network out of Atlanta . Those changes were completed this month , giving AirTran 130 daily departures to 29 cities from Hartsfield International Airport . <p> Corr said yields  --  the amount of money generated by each passenger  --  are 40 percent higher on Atlanta routes because of the business travel market . <p> " We 're back on track now , " he said . <p> The chief executive attributes the summer results to three factors . AirTran spent $ 3 million preparing for a threatened flight attendant strike and suffered a rash of engine problems that required extra maintenance . That helped boost unit costs to 8.6 cents per seat-mile , almost as high as Delta 's . The Delta factor Meanwhile , AirTran contends it lost passengers to an escalation of predatory price-matching by Delta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police predatory pricing , but the rules were delayed after a lobbying campaign by big carriers . <p> " They folded their tent and went home , " Corr said of the DOT , although he added he is hopeful the agency will yet act . He said AirTran has presented specific allegations to the DOT , but he wo n't discuss details . <p> Delta officials hotly deny any wrongdoing and say the DOT guidelines will do more harm than good . They say offering varying numbers of seats at the same fares as AirTran is clean competition . <p> " Their accusations are baseless , " said Mark Drusch , a Delta senior vice president who heads pricing . " We 've been vigorous but aboveboard . " <p> Drusch said Delta has laid out its actions to the DOT , which lodged no objections . He suggested AirTran " should be censured " for its public accusations , made prominently in news releases . " I really think you 've got an airline looking for an easy way out from its own problems , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's complaints , but they agree the airline faces broader problems . <p> " The bigger problem for them is that Delta is able to compete much more effectively than they did when ValuJet started up , " Parker said . " The ( 1996 crash ) changed the competitive situation immensely by prodding people to make the first call to the brand-name airline . That 's still a factor . " Pulling out right stops Delta also has refined its ability to offer significant numbers of matching fares without diluting profits , Parker said . <p> Those factors raise the elemental question of whether AirTran can compete long-term in Delta 's shadow at Hartsfield . <p> " I know there are those who say we should n't operate out of Atlanta , but I do n't know what numbers they see because the ones I see say we should , " said Corr . " It 's just too big a market . Delta 's vulnerable to a well-run alternative . " <p> Corr and other AirTran executives say fares would soar on many routes if their carrier left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing and planning , said numerous small and medium-size companies have voiced that concern and cut volume-based travel deals with AirTran since it installed business class . <p> " They do n't have the size to have much leverage with Delta , and they see in us a very attractive alternative . Atlanta 's full of those companies , " he said . <p> MacKinney says AirTran 's marketing and route strategy wo n't change much in the next few months . The next big move will come next summer when new 717s begin arriving to replace the carrier 's aging DC-9s and 737s . New image planned Corr said AirTran will be able to lease the planes despite its lack of profits , though it may pay higher financing rates . He said the 717s will be cheaper to fly and maintain and will help AirTran build a fresh image . <p> He conceded the stigma of the ValuJet crash remains an obstacle and will for some time . " The world treats us differently , " he said . " It 's just something we have to strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be glaring , notwithstanding the recent accident in which one of its jets ran off a Hartsfield runway after an emergency landing prompted by hydraulic problems . Prior to that , AirTran/ValuJet 's only accident since late 1996 came last spring , when a jet flew through hail over North Georgia and made a forced landing . <p> ( During the same time frame Delta had 24 safety incidents , ranging from very minor to serious , according to the National Transportation Safety Board database on the Internet . ) <p> Corr , who previously held top jobs at Continental and TWA and casts himself as a turnaround specialist , has a year left on his contract . He answers to a board of directors that includes ValuJet co-founders Robert Priddy and Lewis Jordan , who remain major stockholders . <p> When AirTran posted the third-quarter loss , the trade journal Aviation Daily reported Corr 's job was in jeopardy . The airline denied any shake-up was considered . Corr says he still has full control and would n't stay on if he did n't . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , " he said . " Had this business been going great by now I would be leaving . It 's a matter of finishing the job . " <p> " If you do what I do you just get mad and work harder . " D.
