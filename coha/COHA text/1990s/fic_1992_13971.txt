The bedroom of an expensive condo in Chicago . It 's 3 AM and pitch dark in the room . What we ca n't see is how empty it is . There is nothing but a mattress with silken sheets on the floor , and a wilderness of empty pizza boxes , Dr. Pepper cans and hundreds of sharpened pencils on the floor . New supplies of pencils and soft drinks are stacked in a corner , plus the best battery-operated pencil sharpener money can buy . There 's a window leading to a fire escape , a door to a walk-in closet , an outside door , and a door to the rest of the apartment . There is nothing on the walls , and a phone with a long cord sitting somewhere . A woman , Ata , in her early thirties in an expensive nightgown sleeps on the silken sheets . But we ca n't see that yet . Silence . City Sounds . Light Snoring . Suddenly , cans being kicked . ATA WINDUST ( Out of sleep . ) What ? Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in here ? Somebody 's in here . Oh , my God . Do n't hurt me . Do n't kill me . I have eighty dollars , but I do n't know where my purse is . I could write you a check .

He was working so hard for us , his mind was so busy , he was going to work with one sock . I loved it . I loved that he was absentminded , it made me feel close to him . Idiot ! Idiot ! Then I noticed he left with two socks and came home with one . I laughed . I asked my friend Cathy how a lawyer could come home with one sock and she said , " Nooners . " Do you know what " nooners " means ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliver in my brain . Nooners . Nooners . Nooners . I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt . I made harmless scenarios for one sock . Then I found panties in his raincoat pocket . They were n't even cotton ! I waited all day in the apartment . I would pace to one end and hit the wall , then I would pace to the other end and hit the wall . He came home and I confronted him . " Panties , " I said , " panties , you have panties in your raincoat pocket ! " " Gosh , " he says , slapping his forehead like this , " Gosh , thanks for reminding me . They 're evidence in a case , I wanted you to take a look and tell me what store might carry them ! " BO SMITH Lawyers . p. 23 ATA WINDUST I go to Cathy , she says hire a private detective .

His secretary would schedule them and she was having an affair with him . I started having trouble going out of the house , my heart would pound , I would fight for breath . If I got to the elevator I would start sweating , get dizzy , get a terrible headache . I would have to lean against the wall when the door opened , I could n't get out . I saw doctors . One gave me a prescription for Valium , another one said I was nervous and needed to lose weight , the third one asked would n't I be happier pregnant ! I was so miserable I called Wib 's partner Gil , we were friends , he and Wib had been together since law school , maybe he could help me understand . We went to dinner .

( Bo exits . ) ATA WINDUST You 're welcome . Mrs. Carnahan ? MRS . CARNAHAN I 'm here , Mrs. Windust . ATA WINDUST I 'm all right , Mrs. Carnahan . Really , I 'm all right . I 'm not in any danger , no danger of any kind . I 'm not harmed or threatened or in trouble . But , the thing is , Mrs. Carnahan , I 'm not going to open the door because there 's no need and the other reason is I 'm with a lover , Mrs. Carnahan , a lover , a beautiful man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my existence and the thing is , you see , that we are without clothes , that 's the thing , we are scented and oiled and pomaded and fresh from the act of love , and so to open the door would be a betrayal for us and an embarrassment for you and then we would feel judged , you see , and the spell , the spell would be broken , because having lived the life you have , you know how fragile these things are . And after our pleasantries , after you were satisfied with my condition and had gone back to your rooms , my lover , the spell broken , would dress and kiss me somewhat impersonally and close the door behind him with the faintest click , Mrs. Carnahan , and I would be alone , at a time when being alone feels well , feels very worrisome because other things that give meaning well , they get harder and harder to come by , do n't they , Mrs. Carnahan ? ( The lights beginning to fade . ) Harder and harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more without meaning and feeling more and more alone and feeling more and more as if that is perfectly all right , that it 's very compelling to be alone without meaning when that 's probably the worst idea really .

( She gets gradually wilder . ) I said I would subvert every instinct , every impulse , every sense I might possibly have of myself and make sure his golf clubs are delivered . I said I would do that . But before I do that , there is one other thing I have to do . ( She goes to the closet and drags out the bag of clubs . While she pillages , she talks to the clubs . One she bends by stamping on it . Another she smashes over a radiator . A third she warps over a window sill . ) Nooners nooners sand traps you you I will mangle dry-cleaners right at the dry-cleaners golf hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that !

Next week is Wib 's birthday , he goes drinking and he ca n't walk . It 's disgusting . We would dress formally . We would carry champagne and flowers . We would drive up to the checkpoint and I would tell the guard we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party . We would say we 're going now to decorate . The guards like Wib . They would like us to surprise him on his birthday . Then we would rob him and put it in the van and drive back out saying we forgot scotch tape , and we would give them a bottle of champagne so they could celebrate too , and we 'd wave and smile and leave and sell everything . ( A pause , roaring . ) And then I 'd be happy ! ! ROBBIE Not bad . BO SMITH I could go for that . ATA WINDUST ( A faraway look . ) Yes . p. 49 BO SMITH Dress formally ? ATA WINDUST Beyond reproach .

Here we have a Gianni Versace . You will wear a dress ! ( Lights out. ) @x It is 1 A.M. , a bell rings in the hour somewhere in the city . The room is much the same .

( They shake . ) BO SMITH Right . p. 65 ATA WINDUST Bo is Bo is a criminal anthropologist , very famous , like Jane Goodall only with criminals . Yes . Amazing . She lives with them for months at a time . In their habitat . Assessing their rituals and recording their tribal life , becoming part of the urban village , would n't you say ? I would say so , and her new book , Clinical Memoir did n't you call it , Alfred Knopf , already on the lists " The Anti-Social Tribe , " well , it 's really remarkable , really , just remarkable , and so so thick really so , Bo , Wib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing . BO SMITH Well , you know WIB WINDUST I do n't think I ever met an anthropologist with such great legs . BO SMITH No shit . ( Wib laughs . ) Too bad I ca n't see your legs . ( He laughs again . ) WIB WINDUST ( To Ata . ) She 's terrific . ATA WINDUST It 's very late . WIB WINDUST I know . I 'm sorry I was out when you came by . ATA WINDUST I 'm sorry ? WIB WINDUST ( To Bo . ) Ms. Smith , excuse me for bursting in , especially at this hour , and I hope I do n't embarrass you , but is there any possibility that I might have a word alone with my wife ? p. 66 BO SMITH No . WIB WINDUST Just for a minute ? BO SMITH No . WIB WINDUST With my wife ? BO SMITH No . WIB WINDUST I see . You are very direct . In that case . ( To Ata . ) I was out this evening with friends ATA WINDUST With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIB WINDUST ( Unfazed. ) and I returned home to find myself robbed . Very professionally robbed , I might add , no upset , no drawers overturned ( To Bo . ) Is that common ? BO SMITH No . WIB WINDUST And , strangely , they took mainly items which are bones of contention between us , Ata ATA WINDUST When I was robbed WIB WINDUST You were never robbed ATA WINDUST With a truck WIB WINDUST Yes , truck , when I picked up ATA WINDUST Robbed . p. 67 WIB WINDUST Things of mine ATA WINDUST Mine WIB WINDUST Subsequent to discovering your very upsetting affair with my dearest friend and business associate , which could be described at the very least excuse me , Ms. Smith as tasteless and abusive . ATA WINDUST You were having WIB WINDUST ( Cuts her off . ) So . ( To Bo . ) As an anthropologist , this is probably interesting to you . ( To Ata . ) I came home hurt , very fragile , over your disregard for our bond , my feelings , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects , mementos , at the heart , the center of my existence , had been carted off , but oddly enough I can say this really astounded me , I found your earring in the hall this malachite earring which , if I remember clearly , was an anniversary gift , Ata . So I thought I 'd take the opportunity to drop by and ask you personally what the hell is going on here ? ATA WINDUST Wib , I 'm sorry BO SMITH ( Indicating the room . ) She does n't have your stuff , right ? WIB WINDUST No , but she has a terrific supply of Dr. Pepper and pizza . p. 68 BO SMITH So you could be wrong , right ? WIB WINDUST I could be , I could be wrong , Bo , but I believe Ata just told me she was sorry did n't you say you were sorry , sweetheart ? ATA WINDUST It 's not right WIB WINDUST No , it is n't , babe , it 's not right to sleep with my partner , who is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him physically unattractive , and it 's not right by anybody 's standards , and I 'm sure Bo will bear this out , to steal . It is corrupt , degenerate , and desperate . ATA WINDUST They were my things . WIB WINDUST They were things I gave you , Ata . You know it , I know it , if we detailed it for Ms. Smith , she would know it . ATA WINDUST My things ! WIB WINDUST My money . Money I was glad to share with you . Money I was glad to see on your back and on our table . Support I could give you so you could do whatever it is you do . Volunteer or social or whatever , and I respect that because the society needs more than a good lawyer , and a woman does n't have to work to be a meaningful human being . A woman does n't have to be a meaningful human being because what we define as meaning is often just materialism when what is real meaning might be intuition . But none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that on that material level I bought the stuff , and it 's mine . I do n't have intuition , that 's yours , I lack in empathy , that 's yours , but the stuff , Ata , the stuff , goddammit , is mine . p. 69 BO SMITH Or whoever has it . WIB WINDUST Yes . For the moment . But this earring this earring you were in my house and what I am going to do , I 'm going to light a cigarette , babe . ( To Bo . ) One for you ? BO SMITH Yeah . WIB WINDUST I 'm going to light a cigarette ( He lights Bo 's and his. ) then I am going to count to three , and Ata is going to tell us what 's going on one , two three . ( Ata is silent . Wib looks around the room . ) WIB WINDUST It is very depressing how you live now , Ata . This is a disordered mind made manifest . This will attract roaches . ( He sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhead . This is the head of a one thousand dollar Coursefleet wedge . Oh , wait a minute , this is something else , Ata , something else we do n't even want to think about . The reason you did n't send over the clubs you destroyed my clubs , did n't you this has been like severed a severed head I do n't think I 'm calm now . No , I do n't think so because everybody has something , something they care about for no good reason , something that is like an arm to them , a heart , and when you you sever that goddammit , where are my clubs ! p. 70 ATA WINDUST I 'm sorry . WIB WINDUST You 're sorry ? What the hell is that , you 're sorry ? You are sorry on every level , but that is as nothing at all now . That is nothing ! ( He picks something up . ) Do you know what this is ? This is a battery operated pencil sharpener . This is something she cares about because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the goddamn time , she sits on the floor and sharpens pencils , hundreds of pencils that I buy for her , as if she were a committed lunatic , but it is n't a sharpener for long because I 'm going to put the goddamn thing out of its misery . ( He puts it on the floor . ) For no other reason than because you inexplicably care about it , do you understand me ? ( He stamps on it . ) There and there and there . Well , now , by God , it 's a dead pencil sharpener , and I 'm counting to three again , and do n't say you 're sorry . ATA WINDUST Sorry ? WIB WINDUST Yes . ATA WINDUST I never said I was sorry . WIB WINDUST ( To Bo . ) You see what I deal with here ? ATA WINDUST Never . WIB WINDUST Day after day . Time after time . p. 71 ATA WINDUST No . WIB WINDUST You are apologizing half the time you 're awake , Ata , and unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Because I am not I am not , not , not , not sorry , because to be sorry would be madness , and I am not sorry . I am , I 'll tell you what I am , I am bemused at what has happened to me because I signified at one time , I was redolent with promise , fecund with promise , and now I am bleached like a cow skull in a Georgia O'Keefe painting . And what is the sun I curled up under ? The radiance I melted away in ? Why it 's you , Wib . Under your influence I sharpen pencils and eat pepperoni pizza , confined to an empty space with my Dr. Pepper . I am the victim of evaporation of moral fluids , and you are the drought . You are smug and conventional with your place assured and your habits ingrained . You are a second-rate lawyer in a corrupt system doing unimportant paperwork for the scum of the corporate earth in a salmon and green office in an architecturally insignificant skyscraper in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you got a brain-dead interior designer to fill with mail-order furniture that thousands of other second-rate lawyers have dignified with their purchases and mistaken for something they liked . Your conversation is a rehash of magazines you subscribe to , newspapers you read and television you watch without a single self-generated idea or actual concern you did n't co-opt from whatever conservatively correct positions you have self-consciously adopted . You have no passions , or politics , or pain , or paradise ; you have golf clubs . The books you do n't read are the seminal works of the century , and the books you do read are the junk mail of publishing . You ca n't fix your car or your toilet , you ca n't make anything , build anything , or change anything . You 've never eaten something you caught or killed or grew or cooked other than to throw it on a barbecue and make sure it 's rare . You have no sense of the transcendental or the mystical , or the spiritual , you do n't even have a cookie-cutter religion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago Tribune . You never fought in a war or lost a child or lost anything except your car keys and your glasses and your temper and your credit cards . You do n't have a coherent family or a community you love , or close friends , or even a pet , a dog , a cat , or a parakeet ; you have a car phone . Your idea of love is getting it up , and getting it up is all you think about when you make love so that nobody gets anything back from you even when you 're inside them because you are a new kind of super-hero , you are scarecrow man got up for a power lunch and completely devoid of a center or a soul or a commitment except to keep the birdshit off your shoulders with a smile painted on your face as you scare everything alive out of its wits with this phoney intimidation that would n't even kill or maim because it 's just another function of any empty vessel which is all you are , Wib , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , wind in the sails , pretty as a picture , and nobody , nobody , at the wheel ! So I am going out , far out , way out , out beyond you , because I need to see what few real things I can get inside me before it 's too late , and there is no way to get them from you , because the lights are on at your house but there 's nobody home ! ( She accidentally squeezes off a round with the gun pointed toward him . ) I 'm sorry . Excuse me . ( She slams out the door , but unfortunately she has mistakenly gone into the closet with Robbie. ) p. 72 WIB WINDUST ( To Bo . Cool , taking a drag . ) She seems to have gone into the closer . BO SMITH Yeah . WIB WINDUST If I 'm not mistaken , there was a guy in there . BO SMITH Yeah . WIB WINDUST Too bad , let 's talk about you . There 's something hot here , Ms. Smith , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo . WIB WINDUST You 're in a dangerous profession , Bo . You 're brave , you 're smart , and you have extraordinary breasts . BO SMITH Beside the legs . WIB WINDUST Beside the legs . What 's the central motivating factor of the criminal mind ? What makes them tick ? BO SMITH You have it , they want it . WIB WINDUST Really ? BO SMITH Yeah . WIB WINDUST Interesting insight . Let 's talk about me . BO SMITH Why not ? WIB WINDUST I 'm smart , I 'm skilled , I 'm avid , I last . BO SMITH No shit . p. 73 WIB WINDUST Exactly . Listen babe , what do you see ? BO SMITH You mean now ? WIB WINDUST I mean me . BO SMITH Smooth . Real smooth . All the parts together . Like a good car . WIB WINDUST I function . BO SMITH I 'll bet . WIB WINDUST That 's right . No point in taking a great car apart to talk about he pieces . Listen BO SMITH ( She suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIB WINDUST ( A smile . ) Surprising . Very surprising . Perhaps you 'd like my card ? BO SMITH Yeah . WIB WINDUST ( Handing her one . ) Business phone . Country phone . Where could I reach you ? BO SMITH You ca n't reach me . WIB WINDUST Your work . BO SMITH Right . WIB WINDUST Another book . BO SMITH Yeah . WIB WINDUST Criminals . I 'm a buff . Give me a call . p. 74 BO SMITH Why not ? ( He kisses her . ) WIB WINDUST ( Another look at her . ) Very surprising . ( He goes to the closet and knocks . ) Hey babe , I 'm sorry to interrupt you , but I 've got a long drive . I 'll send over a list of the things I 'm talking about . If they mysteriously reappear , well , I know you 're impulsive . Otherwise , twenty-four hours from now I call the police . We can still be friends , Ata . I 'll send over a case of Dr. Pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigid . ( He turns back to Bo and puts out his hand . ) A pleasure , Ms. Smith . BO SMITH Fuckin ' A. ( He laughs then shakes his head in amazement and goes out , closing the door . Bo stands for a moment and then goes over to the closet and opens the door . Robbie and Ata are discovered , partially disrobed in a feverish embrace which continues even after she has opened the door . Bo crosses away , picks up a Dr. Pepper and opens it . She drinks and turns to watch the closet . ) BO SMITH ( A moment . ) Yo , Robbie . ROBBIE ( Seeing her . ) Yeah . BO SMITH Come on out . p. 75 ROBBIE Right . BO SMITH Now . ROBBIE I 'm trying . BO SMITH Ata ! ATA WINDUST What ! ? BO SMITH He 's gone . ATA WINDUST Good . ( She reaches out and slams the closet door shut . ) BO SMITH ( Chuckling . ) Man . ( The closet flies open and Robbie escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a stick shift here . ATA WINDUST ( Roaring . ) I want it ! I want life ! BO SMITH ( To Robbie . ) So , is it hard to get out of a tux ? ROBBIE You tell me . ( Ata starts toward him . Robbie moves to the door . ) ROBBIE I ought a get the truck out to the fence . ATA WINDUST No . ROBBIE So he ca n't trace the stuff . So we can split the money . ATA WINDUST But he knows . p. 76 BO SMITH He do n't know , he 's got an opinion . ATA WINDUST But the police . BO SMITH It ai n't so easy to prove shit . They got a conviction every time they found an earring , they 'd have to make the whole state a joint . ROBBIE I 'm out of here . ATA WINDUST Bur you 'll come back ? ROBBIE I got ta take care of business . ATA WINDUST Later tonight ? ROBBIE Hey , trust me . BO SMITH You heard the lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Sure . Yeah . I 'll be back . ( To Ata . ) You 're a fuckin ' firecracker . ( To Be . ) I 'm gone . ( He goes . ) BO SMITH ( To Ata after the door closes . ) So , whattaya think ? ( Ata suddenly embraces her . ) BO SMITH He was settin ' you up . ATA WINDUST ( Pulls back from the embrace . ) No . BO SMITH Yeah . He figures maybe there was something left to hustle . p. 77 ATA WINDUST From me . Hustle me ? BO SMITH Yeah . ATA WINDUST No . BO SMITH Yeah . ATA WINDUST He is rat mucus . BO SMITH But he 's a good kisser . ATA WINDUST He 's despicable ; he 's an animal ; I want him . BO SMITH I noticed . ATA WINDUST I hate that . BO SMITH Hustle him . It 's possible . ATA WINDUST But he 's hustling me . BO SMITH But he 's a good kisser . ATA WINDUST Would you come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wacko . ATA WINDUST You could bring Sarah . You could get out . You could get a job where I volunteer . BO SMITH Where is that ? ATA WINDUST Parker Community Center . Drug counseling . We drive dealers off our street . BO SMITH Yeah ? ATA WINDUST It 's very successful . p. 78 BO SMITH You know where they go ? They go six blocks up . ATA WINDUST They would love to hire you . BO SMITH Yeah , right . ATA WINDUST You 're the underclass , you have the real problems the underclass have , you 're abused , you 've been driven to crime , plus you 're intelligent , you 're a woman , and you 're a mother . If you would say you 're Republican , you 'd be perfect for funding . BO SMITH How the fuck do you live in the world ? ATA WINDUST Please , Bo . BO SMITH It pays what ?
