THE VENTURESOME diaspora of some 55 million Overseas Chinese is emerging as far more than the main force behind the sizzling growth of the Pacific Rim economies  --  though that in itself is no small achievement ( see previous story ) . Spurred by a distinctive business culture that relies upon constant scanning for opportunities and an incomparable cooperative web , they are fast establishing themselves as nothing less than the world 's most vigorous capitalists . Says Barton M. Biggs , the head of global investment at Morgan Stanley and a man who has made  --  and won  --  a number of sizable bets by investing in Overseas Chinese companies : " No group is more entrepreneurial and intensely commercial . " Experienced investors in Asia have long known that the best way to get something done there is to plug into the Overseas Chinese network . Its members dominate trade and investment in every East Asian country except Korea and Japan . They possess not only the biggest reservoir of capital but also critical political connections and the best practical information for surviving in difficult markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Fung , 49 , chairman of the Hong Kong investment bank Prudential Asia : " If you are being considered for a new partnership , a personal reference from a respected member of the Chinese business community is worth more than any amount of money you could throw on the table . " Now the Overseas Chinese are increasingly expanding beyond their Asian base . As they do that , more and more Europeans and Americans  --  potential customers , partners , and competitors  --  are seeing their drive and clout firsthand . In Point Comfort , Texas , Y.C . Wang , 77 , founder and chairman of Taiwan 's Formosa Plastics Group , has just completed a $2.1 billion petrochemical and plastics-making plant  --  the largest investment by a privately held corporation in that size-conscious state 's history . In New York City , Cheng Yu-tong , 68 , a Hong Kong real estate billionaire who owns the Renaissance and Stouffer hotel chains in the U.S. , has taken control of Donald Trump 's troubled Riverside South project , which aims to build a $2.5 billion apartment complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American product , the Girl Scout cookie , is now produced mainly by eight U.S. bakeries owned by President Enterprises , a Taiwanese food conglomerate that has also acquired the maker of Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies . For all this group 's growing power , though , theirs is still an intensely private world , only dimly understood by outsiders . As a minority group that has long suffered persecution and discrimination  --  problems that still flare up from time to time today  --  most Overseas Chinese shy away from publicity and cling to their own community . Even the public companies they run are merely parts of family-controlled conglomerates that rarely reveal the full details of their finances or ownership structure . The businesses the Overseas Chinese dominate , fields like trading , real estate , and finance , purvey no branded products , which also tends to keep them out of the public 's eye . That 's changing as they expand into such high-tech growth fields as telecommunications and computers , but there 's no Overseas Chinese equivalent of a highly visible business leader like Sony 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does occasionally open up . For more than a year I have interviewed scores of top Overseas Chinese executives , including many who rarely talk with the press . They spoke candidly about their operations , their business philosophy , their future plans . One striking revelation : Probably the biggest worry troubling these first-generation business pioneers , who have tended to share power reluctantly and only with family members , is how best to cope with their success . A study of mostly Overseas Chinese conglomerates by T.C. Chu and Trevor MacMurray , consultants in the Hong Kong office of McKinsey &; Co. , warned recently , " Their organizations are overcentralized , and their management processes are too ad hoc or complex " for the scale their businesses have achieved . Even so , I came away convinced that most of these Oriental John D. Rockefellers and Andrew Carnegies will respond imaginatively and adapt to these new challenges as they have to past ones . Meanwhile , they have much to teach outsiders about how to build , manage , and sustain fast-growing businesses . Start with values . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Overseas Chinese share an abiding belief in hard work , strong family ties , frugality , and education . Yes , this same constellation of virtues defines much of what Westerners have labeled the Protestant ethic , but for the Overseas Chinese these attributes are n't musty relics from their culture 's past but compelling rules to live by . The best of them derive a joy from business and pursue it with an intensity that has become uncommon in many developed countries . " Losing money is a crime against society , " says Taiwan 's Kao Chin-yen , 65 , vice chairman of $905-million-a-year President Enterprises . " If our business were to collapse , I would feel like committing suicide . And work has become such a habit that if I had none to do , I would feel ill . " Not surprisingly , nearly every ethnic Chinese billionaire is self-made . Y.C . Wang , the Taiwanese plastics king , had to quit school after the sixth grade but taught himself to master a complex industry . Wang , who looks a bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a day off and views most personal consumption as undue extravagance . To keep him appropriately garbed , Wang 's wife gets a tailor to copy his worn suits and sneaks the new ones into the billionaire 's closet . His basic philosophy sums up the stern creed of his compatriots : " Work hard and never waste money . " Li Ka Shing , 66 , a shrewd Hong Kong real estate trader with a personal net worth of over $5 billion , has donated an entire medical university to his native city of Shantou , China . Still , Li has no corporate jet and wears a Japanese Citizen electronic wristwatch that cost him under $100 . Li once proudly remarked to this writer , " I 'll bet your watch is more expensive than mine . " ( He was wrong  --  but not by much . ) Even in their vices , wealthy Overseas Chinese often demonstrate fiscal prudence . When changing mistresses , for example , one super-rich Hong Kong businessman allows his soon-to-be-ex to put a value on their relationship by handing her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact has a cap . The mistress knows the check is drawn from a special account set up solely for this purpose ; what she does n't know is how much money is in it  --  roughly $200,000 . So if she proves too greedy , the check will bounce . Such frugality carries over to stewardship of corporate assets . Compared with the hired managers of Western corporations , the Overseas Chinese are decidedly wary of debt . The most treasured asset of any ethnic Chinese businessman , be he a billionaire or a small manufacturer with a one-room workshop , is xinyong , which means having both a good reputation and a solid credit rating . One consequence : In the mid-1980s , when Western investment bankers were hawking participations in leveraged buyouts , they found few takers among Overseas Chinese . " We did n't want to seem responsible for all that debt , " explains Peter Woo , 48 , chairman of Hong Kong 's Wheelock Group , whose $12 billion in assets range from real estate to a cable television network . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen appreciation for the value of money with risk averseness , however . In pursuit of their goal of constant expansion , these entrepreneurial executives are ready and willing to place big bets . While Texans may marvel at the giant petrochemical project Y.C . Wang is building in the Lone Star State , it 's small stuff compared with the $9 billion complex he 's erecting back in Taiwan  --  a mini-city that just may be the largest manufacturing investment on the planet these days . What fuels this high-octane mix of conservatism and overweening ambition ? Some academics stress the teachings of Confucius . the ancient Chinese philosopher who extolled the virtues of family solidarity and education . But Confucius ' legacy also had a downside : In his hierarchical vision of society , merchants ranked at the very bottom , which helps explain why China created few notable capitalists during the centuries before Mao Zedong . The more crucial element seems to be this group 's common heritage as immigrants . Says Lee Shau Kee , 65 , who moved to Hong Kong just before Mao came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth from developing real estate : " The success of the Overseas Chinese is the result of bad times in China itself . The Chinese who left the mother country had to struggle , and that became a culture of its own , passed on from father to son through each generation . Because we have no social security , the Overseas Chinese habit is to save a lot and make a lot of friends . " LIKE YEAST mixed with warm water and flour , the Overseas Chinese rose only when they reached alien lands that provided them with stability and the freedom to flourish . This outpouring is not merely a recent phenomenon . In the 15th century , when the great eunuch Admiral Zheng He led a fleet of 300 vessels around Southeast Asia to impress the natives with the glory of the Ming Dynasty , he discovered that many of his fellow Chinese had already settled there . The biggest wave of migration came at the high tide of colonialism in the last century , when Chinese streamed into Southeast Asia as poor peasants and coolie laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tin mines later became small merchants . By the time the colonialists departed from places such as Indonesia and Malaysia after World War II , the Chinese were simply the most experienced local businessmen left . The uncertainties and hardships posed by their life as immigrants have reinforced the Overseas Chinese penchant for a guarded , controlling style of doing business . Most of their enterprises , even multibillion-dollar public companies , are family affairs , ruled by a patriarch who makes all key decisions . Major deals are done only with people he knows and trusts . Just about every Chinese business proprietor is a hands-on entrepreneur . One benefit of such a culture is speed . Says Washington Sy-Cip , the ethnic Chinese chairman of the accounting and management consulting firm SGV in Manila : " The Overseas Chinese smell profits quickly and make decisions even quicker . They are pragmatic , not legalistic . " Peter Woo claims , for instance , that he can close a deal to buy a hotel in Asia in days , while a similar transaction in the U.S. might easily take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management firmly in the hands of a single family , Overseas Chinese companies are often more willing  --  and certainly more able  --  than widely held public corporations to take a long view of their investments . Without the pressure of outside shareholders who demand ever-rising quarterly earnings , they focus instead on the cash that a potential deal will throw off . Explains Peter Woo : " That means you can do a good project that does n't yield an immediate return . It 's your money , so you never sell things simply to dress up the profit-and-loss statement . It does n't matter whether the payoff is coming this year or next year . " Following this philosophy , Woo himself is moving to invest as much as 20% of his company 's $12 billion in assets in projects in mainland China  --  albeit very gradually . Above all , business intelligence and capital speed across the Overseas Chinese community because its members are superb networkers . At its most basic level , the Overseas Chinese network allows you to deposit dollars at a gold shop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rate from that shop owner 's compatriot in Ho Chi Minh City . ( This underground banking system works because its operatives are willing to wait to settle their accounts in safe havens that boast hard currencies . ) During political upheavals in the Philippines in the 198-s , the informal banking system shifted Overseas Chinese funds into Hong Kong and Singapore . If tax collectors get overzealous in , say , Thailand , a friendly supplier in Hong Kong can overbill a Thai factory owner for equipment and deposit the difference in an offshore account . By accident , I first discovered the efficiency with which this network exchanges information while randomly interviewing Overseas Chinese business leaders in several Asian countries more than two decades ago . After the first stop , all the other businessmen knew about my assignment and precisely whom I had already met . This cooperative web has evolved from hundreds of interlocking family companies and relationships held together by trust that has been tested for decades . Tapping into the Chinese network can provide a tremendous advantage in Asia even to the largest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wal-Mart , which has never before ventured beyond the Western Hemisphere , plans to open stores in Hong Kong and China in league with an ethnic Chinese conglomerate from Thailand , the Charoen Pokphand Group . Says Don Shinkle , Wal-Mart 's vice president for corporate affairs : " There 's not a heck of a lot that we know about retailing in China , so we found an outstanding teacher . " Wal-Mart 's Asian partner already has stakes in over 55 ventures in the People 's Republic , including one with Pizza Hut in Shanghai . The foundation of this pervasive network is guanxi  --  personal connections . These often extend beyond mere business connections to include relationships with political powers-that-be  --  influential army generals in Indonesia and Thailand , say , or Communist Party officials in China . According to Lee Kuan Yew , 71 , the senior government minister in Singapore , Overseas Chinese use guanxi in China " to make up for the lack of the rule of law and transparency in rules and regulations . " In that hazy business environment , speaking the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any serious transaction . STEP INTO the deep-carpeted Hong Kong boardroom of the Lippo Group , an Indonesian financial and property conglomerate with some $6 billion in assets , and you can quickly spot the importance that Overseas Chinese businessmen place on meeting the right people . Prominently displayed in ornate gold-trimmed frames are two photographs of Chairman Mochtar Riady  --  one with Premier Li Peng of China , the other with Bill and Hillary Clinton . Says Riady , 65 , who specializes in cultivating relationships for Lippo and leaves day-to-day business operations to his two sons : " I open the door , and others walk through . " Riady has built a global business by leveraging the contacts of a lifetime . Born in Indonesia , he studied banking in Nanjing and added mainland Chinese friends to his network . After the Communists took over , Riady returned home and skillfully revitalized several small banks . Consequently , Liem Sioe Liong , the richest Indonesian Chinese entrepreneur , recruited Riady to help manage his Bank of Central Asia and gave him a stake in it . In 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indonesia , including a partnership with a bank owned by an Indonesian navy foundation , Riady acquired the oldest Overseas Chinese bank in the U.S. , now called Lippo Bank California . Pursuing the Chinese art of reciprocal back-scratching , Riady then set up a string of Hong Kong public companies with total capitalization of $2.5 billion . Earnings of Lippo Ltd. , the flagship these sail under , leaped 80% last year to $55.7 million , on revenues of $221 million . Property billionaire Li Ka Shing has taken a 9.4% stake in Lippo Ltd. and is bringing his Indonesian friend into various real estate deals . Says Stephen Riady , 34 , the chairman 's youngest son and his deputy in Hong Kong : " My father always says that to catch a horse , you 've got to ride another fast horse . " To gallop into China , Chairman Riady has made strategic alliances with two leading PRC companies in Hong Kong , China Resources and China Travel Service . It helps , of course , that a former classmate is a senior executive of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong Chinese Bank . In turn , China Travel is a partner in a bank that Riady has set up in Shenzhen , just across the border from Hong Kong . This joint venture can deal in Chinese currency , a privilege normally off limits to foreign banks . Next year much of the network that currently exists only in the heads and Rolodexes of master dealmakers like Riady will be going on-line . The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce is organizing a computer database of ethnic Chinese business people around the region that will include their specialities and how to contact them . Says Kwek Leng Joo , 41 , president of the Singapore chamber : " The idea is to make the network more systematic and help facilitate cooperation . " It 's not clear whether outsiders will be able to tap into this network . But what 's certain is that crucial Overseas Chinese contacts in the People 's Republic will not be shared in cyberspace . Says Kwek , a senior executive in his family 's diversified Hong Leong Group , which has $5 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know in China and whether I have some network there is exclusive information . I hardly make it known even to my closest friends . " But do n't waste time fretting about this group 's inevitable edge in doing business in mainland China . The main lesson the Chinese business community has to teach a globalizing economy is the profit that can be realized by taking advantage of what John Kao , an associate professor at the Harvard business school , calls knowledge arbitrage . Think of this as a fancy term for cross-border dealmaking  --  especially dealmaking aimed at bringing suppliers and technology together from disparate markets to serve a third market 's unmet need . Richard Li , 27 , the youngest son of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing , carried off a splendid feat of knowledge arbitrage in 1990 by launching Star TV , the first pan-Asian satellite broadcaster . He built that valuable new business by bringing together a U.S. satellite vehicle , a rocket launcher made in the PRC , and international expertise in broadcasting . Though the company 's operations have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year Rupert Murdoch bought most of Star TV in a transaction that valued Li 's creation at $825 million , six times the amount Li invested in the company . WHEELOCK Group 's Peter Woo plows a similar furrow . Already this year he has formed joint ventures with such companies as Fosters of Australia , to establish breweries in China , and the Virgin Group of Britain , to open stores offering records , books , and videotaped entertainment in Hong Kong , Taiwan , and China . A former Chase Manhattan banker , Woo catapulted to a high position within the Overseas Chinese world after he married one of the four daughters of the late Y.K. Pao , whose greatest business feat was building the world 's largest private charter shipping fleet and then selling much of it well before the shipping industry crashed in 1975 . A hyperactive networker , Woo serves as an official adviser to Beijing as well as an adviser to the British governor of Hong Kong . He hobnobs with George Bush and Britain 's Prince of Wales , and is the first Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a Beijing-controlled partner , Woo is building a new tunnel under the Hong Kong harbor . He 's also developing office buildings with shopping centers in such cities as Shanghai , Beijing , and Dalien . And should any of his allies need financing , Woo can handle that too , through a new investment bank he bas set up in Hong Kong with National Westminster of Britain . Now , lest you assume knowledge arbitrage is merely a game for dealmakers , consider Patrick Wang , 43 , managing director of Johnson Electric . Over the past decade , Wang has transformed his family 's Hong Kong company from a manufacturer of motors for toys into a producer of industrial micro-motors that 's second only to Mabuchi of Japan . Most of us , without realizing it , use Johnson motors every day-to control windows and adjust mirrors in cars , to run hair dryers and kitchen appliances , and to cut paper on fax machines . Where does the arbitrage come in ? Wang , who has a master 's degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and assembles them in Hong Kong , where the factory is highly automated , as well as in Thailand and South China , where labor is cheaper . To keep track of this sprawling operation , Wang recently installed a videoconferencing system that operates around the clock . Now Johnson 's customers in the U.S. and Europe can see their motors taking shape in South China while talking ( in German or English ) with engineers in Hong Kong . For all its new technology , Johnson Electric , which last fiscal year earned $44 million on $195 million in sales , remains in many ways a traditional Overseas Chinese enterprise . Its board is dominated by family members . Wang Seng Liang , 80 , the patriarch , is chairman and his wife , vice chairman . Each owned and ran factories in Shanghai until they were nationalized by the Communists . In 1950 the entrepreneurial couple started all over again with tailor shops in Hong Kong . ( The Chinese name for Johnson , Zhou Chun , means making things inch by inch and thus connotes quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner table , an experience that he describes " as a living case study on financial problems . " The chairman continues to come to the office each morning and advises Patrick , who says , " I still learn a great deal from my father , such as to expect the unexpected and always stay open-minded . " Wang had occasion to recall his father 's advice during a frustrating three-year search for his first factory site in China . Turned off by the bureaucratic attitudes of most local officials , he finally came across the unexpected at Shajing , a rural village in Guangdong province that was so poor even older children ran around without pants . Recalls Wang : " Still , here was this village leader saying his people were the most honest and hard-working in China . I wondered if he could be serious . Then I saw how he ran things . You know , Chinese business is basically people and contacts . We struck up a very good relationship , and today he 's still our partner . " Johnson Electric , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has three modern plants around Shajing . AS THESE AGILE family firms grow into substantial global corporations , finding competent managers who can carry the founder 's vision forward is by far their biggest challenge . No patriarch can foreordain that his eldest son , the traditional successor , will have the right stuff . To raise the odds , they rigorously prepare their offspring through a combination of instruction at first-class universities and on-the-job training . At its best , this is a nepotism of merit . Once his education ends , an heir must prove he possesses the requisite entrepreneurial grit by independently pulling off a successful business deal . Says Peter K.K. Lee , 31 , the eldest son of Lee Shau Kee , the billionaire founder of Henderson Land in Hong Kong : " Maybe it 's good training , but the pressure is terrible . " Lee 's first big test came three years ago , when he was dispatched to Texas with orders to find real estate for the family 's private investment company . Rather than simply acquiring a single trophy property , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a couple thousand or so " apartments scattered around Houston , Dallas , and San Antonio . Altogether he invested more than $230 million on properties that yield an annual return from rentals of 13% to 14% . The transactions demonstrated his knack for spotting hidden value . Says Peter , who also acquired an ulcer putting together that portfolio : " After all those purchases my dad went there , checking out whether I made any mistakes . He was satisfied , and I got a free hand to develop property in China . " As this younger generation rises , a new model for Overseas Chinese enterprises is gradually emerging , one that relies more on Western management techniques and yet retains the traditional strengths of a family-owned firm . Says William Fung , 45 , managing director of Li &; Fung , one of the oldest trading companies in Hong Kong : " We typify the transition from a first-generation entrepreneurial firm to a company that is being made more professional to compete with Japan and the multinationals . " Even for Fung , a Harvard MBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Fung , which specializes in exporting toys , garments , and consumer products to the U.S. and Europe . Ownership of the company was scattered among dozens of relatives who treated the business  --  founded by William 's grandfather in 1905  --  as a birthright . The firm employed just about any Fung who needed a job , but operated without a real financial plan or budget and paid no dividends . William 's solution was to take Li &; Fung public on the Hong Kong stock exchange , which helped improve both its accounting practices and its management team . Later , however , many family shareholders got nervous about China 's scheduled takeover of Hong Kong in 1997 and wanted to cash out . So William and his elder brother Victor , another Harvard MBA , who is chairman of both the family company and Prudential Asia , arranged an LBO with bank financing in 1989 . Says William : " Our relatives worry about the future , but we see this as the golden age for a trading company , " especially one with a low-cost manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and selling off fringe businesses like chartered boats , the brothers took it public again in 1992 . Last year Li &; Fung earned $25.6 million on wholesale revenues of $650 million . WITH the characteristic Overseas Chinese flair for leveraging business relationships , Victor and William have generated new sources of income for a firm that once thrived by flogging fireworks . No longer merely a buying agent , Li &; Fung now invests in some of its American clients through a venture capital arm based in San Francisco . The returns can be phenomenal . A few years ago the Fungs invested $200,000 to acquire 33% of Cyrk , a small company that makes T-shirts and novelty promotional items for the likes of Mars and Nike . Cyrk has just gone public , and the Fungs have cleared over $11 million while retaining half their shares . Separately , through a private Hong Kong company , the Fungs are bringing U.S. retailers into Asia , including Toys " R " Us and Circle K convenience stores . At President Enterprises in Taiwan , founder Kao Chin-yen is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company by relying heavily on professional managers . Kao , who grew up as a poor country boy in the southern town of Tainan , got his start by plugging into a powerful local network , a group of legitimate businessmen who happen to be called the Tainan Gang . Its members provided seed capital to start President in 1967 , but Kao hires no one 's relatives . Since then , Kao has expanded President from a simple flour mill to a conglomerate that dominates the food industry in Taiwan and is growing fast internationally . Many senior executives are former schoolteachers , recruited because Kao regards them as leaders with good moral character . He also likes managers who are hungry for success . Says Kao : " The people who achieve the most in business come from poor backgrounds . They struggle and are willing to take any challenge . " To keep managers busy long after he eventually retires , Kao has imbued them with the vision of making President the world 's biggest food company within 25 years . That may seem ridiculously audacious , considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  mere crumbs alongside Nestle 's revenues of nearly $39 billion . To Kao , though , President 's expected growth is just a matter of " simple arithmetic . " His company is systematically establishing food-processing factories in key parts of mainland China plus Southeast Asia  --  new markets with a total of more than 1.7 billion consumers . And then there 's America , where President has invested over $400 million to acquire cookie manufacturers and is looking for more acquisitions . FOR THE FORESEEABLE future , look for this kind of grand ambition  --  and the drive to achieve it  --  to remain a hallmark of Overseas Chinese companies , regardless of whether they are run by professional managers or patriarchs . Case in point : Formosa Plastics , whose 77-year-old chairman , Y.C . Wang , is making some of the largest manufacturing investments in the world at an age when even pioneering industrialists typically slow down a bit . Starting with a $670,000 loan in 1957 , Wang has constructed a plastics empire that generated $7 billion in sales and earned a 16.3% return on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest son and senior vice president : " This group is really the story of one man . " Maybe . But what assures its future is that the chairman has trained and installed a management team that seems certain to follow his example . They include not only Winston but eight other children , plus the founder 's brother . Though he talks mainly about the nitty-gritty of plastics , Wang has molded his well-educated offspring to fit his values . Daughter Susan , 34 , a graduate in economics from Barnard College of Columbia University , oversees part of the U.S. operations with the deceptively modest title assistant to the president . Says she : " We know how valuable money is and teach that to our children " All of Wang 's children , in fact , proudly talk and act like young clones of their old man . Probably no other Wang , however , has the stature or nerve right now to play the founder 's role in mainland China , where he has been haggling for seven years over a potential giant investment . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move unless it is economically rational : " As long as you have a socialist system , you do not have a market economy . Anybody who wants to invest in China has to wait for the system to be improved . " Rather than waiting forever , Wang is trying to bend the PRC 's system by setting up three plants that will make plastic pipe and pay managers solely on an incentive basis . Though officials in China have resisted the idea , he keeps hammering away at them . Insists Wang : " I want to teach China the entrepreneurial spirit and introduce efficient management . " If Wang and his compatriots around Asia do manage to infuse the People 's Republic with their pragmatic approach to business and their industrious values , China will surely become the dominant force in the world economy during the next century . More likely , though , their homeland will absorb only bits and pieces of the diaspora 's fabulous success formula . And the most dynamic capitalists on earth will continue to be the Overseas Chinese . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
