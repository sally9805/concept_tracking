What 's wrong with the Clinton foreign policy ? After retreat from Somalia , humiliation in Haiti , capitulation to North Korea and dithering over Bosnia , the question becomes acute . The answer does not lie only with a President who has little experience in foreign policy and less interest . Nor does it lie solely with his foreign policy team of well-meaning souls lacking in steel , the kind needed to take a stand and stick to it . <P> At root , the problem is not personalities but ideas . Even the most skilled statesman would flounder if lashed to the central idea of the Clinton foreign policy : that in the post-cold war era the U.S. can shed its arduous international responsibilities by transferring them to the U.N . or sundry other multilateral constructions . The subordination of America to the will of " " provides a convenient alibi for failure . But it is also a near guarantee of failure and a source of endless , needless humbling of the planet 's sole remaining superpower . <P> Take Bosnia . The Clinton Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything about it directly , has chosen indirect involvement through NATO and the U.N . The result ? Rather than harness awesome American air power ( on display only three years ago in the Gulf War ) to a coherent campaign to do something significant about Serb advances , the U.S. allows its air force to become the instrument of absurd power struggles among U.N . officials in Bosnia . <P> U.N . Commander Michael Rose calls in air strikes around Gorazde , but the U.N . ' s chief civilian representative in Bosnia , Yasushi Akashi , preferring negotiation , vetoes them . When air strikes are called again and finally approved by the U.N . bureaucrats , NATO planes are foiled by weather , and a British Sea Harrier jet is shot down . The pinprick attacks fail even to achieve the minimal logic of tit for tat . They become tit for tat  --  when the weather is good and Akashi is in the mood . <P> Procedures have since been streamlined , but procedure is not the problem . The problem is that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general staff , no military expertise , no command structure  --  direct a NATO air campaign in the Balkans . <P> Beyond tactics , moreover , the U.N . has no strategy . Nothing holds the pieces together . There are thousands of peacekeeping troops ; on-again , off-again negotiations ; the occasional ultimatum , flexibly enforced ; the odd air strike . Amounting to what ? <P> This lack of objectives is not the fault of the U.N . bureaucracy . Strategy is not its business . That must come from the Great Powers . But when the U.S. makes plain that it will pursue nothing that does not command the assent of " the allies "  --  and the allies have conflicting objectives  --  the result is guaranteed chaos . <P> The Gulf War was a success because it was clear to all that the U.S. was going to liberate Kuwait even if it had to go it alone . Join us if you will , but we wo n't waver . They joined . Lesser powers do so when convinced of American will .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
