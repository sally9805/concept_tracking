Last October , time senior correspondent Jack White noted that in the same week , one African-American author , Toni Morrison , won the Nobel Prize for Literature while another , Poet Laureate Rita Dove , read her work at the White House . Not long thereafter , another black poet , Yusef Komunyakaa , won the Pulitzer Prize . White began to wonder whether these events and the increasing prominence of other African-American authors signaled a black literary efflorescence . <P> Subsequent reporting by associate editor Janice Simpson and editorial assistant Breena Clarke on dance , film , music and theater quickly revealed that the artistic flowering was much broader than a literary one . " In all of these fields , " says White , " what struck me was the audacity and exuberance of the artists , some of whom had moved beyond racial themes and so-called black styles , and felt free to explore any form . " That freedom is the keynote of this week 's cover story , written by White . <P> For Simpson , covering the Black Renaissance was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy chief of correspondents , in charge of TIME 's national-news coverage . As enthusiastic as Simpson is about her new duties , which include supervising 68 correspondents in 11 bureaus , her work on this story reminded her of how much she will miss her first love , covering the arts . Says she : " Nothing makes me happier than being in the audience in a darkened theater , playing some small part in the magic happening onstage . " <P> Clarke , who focused on black theater , had firsthand experience of that magic : she was a professional actress before joining TIME in 1984 . Today she keeps in touch with the field through her husband , actor Helmar Cooper . <P> The cover portrait of choreographer Bill T. Jones , as well as all the photographs of black artists accompanying the story , were shot by staff photographer Ted Thai . For good measure , Thai also took the striking portraits of Yale scholar Harold Bloom and hot young filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in this week 's issue . As deputy picture editor MaryAnne Golon points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to incorporate an artist 's discipline into a photograph . " To incorporate the marvelous achievements of today 's African-American artists into the frame of a cover story , all of our Black Renaissance team have shown similar gifts .
