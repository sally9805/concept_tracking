The marchers , more than 200,000 strong , simply defied the government ban , the thousands of police , the scores of military vehicles . As an evening snow shower dusted their faces , the supporters of change in the Soviet Union thronged Moscow 's streets to deliver a pungent political message , savoring the act of public assembly in the face of Mikhail Gorbachev 's order forbidding rallies , and then tramped peacefully home . For what , then , had the Kremlin assembled an enormous security force  --  to protect itself against its own people ? <P> Gorbachev 's futile show of force surely marked another drop in his waning popularity . Amid the ranks of uniformed men , a solitary woman stood weeping . " This is the country I love , " said Natalia Kositskaya , a 50-year-old doctor at a Moscow military clinic , " and I am ashamed of it . I never would have believed Gorbachev could do this . In the past two years , he has become a devil . " Her tears continued as she pointed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <P> Only two years ago , President Gorbachev was urging the Soviet people to be bold , to show initiative , to carry out demokratizatsiya at all levels . " Perestroika , " he said , " is a revolution . " That definition may have seemed all too literal to him last week as the marching Muscovites disobeyed him to prove their support for his main rival , Russian leader Boris Yeltsin . Just as ominously , thousands of striking miners , from the Ukraine to western Siberia , were also resorting to politics , and joined their city cousins in demanding Gorbachev 's resignation . <P> Like the whole of the ailing Soviet economy , the mine strike has been festering for years . But Gorbachev brought last week 's confrontation in the capital on himself . Communists inside the Russian republic 's parliament had called a special session to mount a no-confidence vote against Yeltsin . Many feel that the maverick Russian should be dismissed for demanding Gorbachev 's resignation , for supporting the breakaway Baltic republics and for such other sins as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support by only a thin margin in the 1,068-seat parliament , his position was strengthened three weeks ago by a question he inserted into the national referendum . Seventy percent of those who voted said yes to his idea of a popularly elected President , for which he would be the clear favorite . Last week 's rally , for which plans had been announced even before the referendum , would burnish his image still further . <P> Gorbachev struck back with a ban on all public demonstrations in Moscow for three weeks , suggesting that deputies in the Russian parliament would be intimidated if they had to wade through an ocean of yelling Yeltsinites . To make sure the ban was enforced , the President took police powers away from the city council and turned them over to the national Interior Ministry , which mustered a virtual army of trucks , water cannons and troops in riot gear . Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov spoke of " looming threats , " and Anatoli Karpychev , deputy editor of Pravda , the party daily , charged that radicals were planning a coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kremlin have already begun .
