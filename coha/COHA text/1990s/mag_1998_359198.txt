When General Motors ' Saturn plant was opened amid the cornfields of Spring Hill , Tenn. , in 1990 , it was billed as a kind of corporate nirvana where a folksy labor force and enlightened managers would happily work to produce some of the best darn American cars on the road . The plant represented a unified front against growing Japanese imports and offered the broader prospect of peace between GM and the United Auto Workers . <P> But last week the seething revolt that started at two GM parts plants in old-fashioned Flint , Mich. , spread to this Southern paradise . The Flint strike shut off critical parts to the company , forcing the closure of 26 assembly plants and 100 component factories across North America and idling 186,000 workers . The strike is weighing on the economy too , contributing to a 0.6% drop in industrial output in June . The Saturn factory is the only GM plant in the U.S. still turning out cars . Leaders at Saturn 's Local 1853 , angry over a management decision to cut negotiated bonuses from $1,400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sunday on whether to strike the New Age plant . The angst is spreading , with union locals at GM plants in Dayton , Ohio ; Indianapolis , Ind. ; and Bowling Green , Ky. , talking about their own job actions once the Flint strike is settled . GM insists it is just trying to stay competitive in outmoded plants , but the company 's tough stance has rankled labor . Says Richard Shoemaker , the U.A.W. vice president negotiating with GM : " You never have to phony things up with GM to get a strike going . There are always enough legitimate issues around . " <P> Settling the strike  --  an arbitration hearing is scheduled for Wednesday over GM 's claim that the walkouts in Flint are illegal  --  is to some extent the least of the company 's problems . GM faces enormous challenges with its products , its market strategy , its international business and even its leadership . Many of GM 's critics believe that the world 's largest automaker needs another total makeover . That means dumping factories , jobs  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer needed in GM 's shrinking empire . <P> The last time GM reorganized , in 1992 , following a directors ' revolt , chairman John F. ( Jack ) Smith Jr . was handed the wheel . Now the company that Smith heads is reeling . Profits fell 81% in the second quarter , to $389 million from $2.1 billion . Results would have been weak even without the strike . <P> The Saturn conflict is a case study in GM 's mounting woes . Perhaps the company 's most notable success in the 1990s , the mid-priced , compact Saturns were sold with a revolutionary no-pressure style of salesmanship . Saturn has won high praise for winning consumers away from the likes of popular Toyota and Honda . Trouble is , corporate infighting over resources has prevented GM from upgrading Saturn 's basic design or adding a new model since the station wagon was introduced in 1992 . Worse yet , other GM divisions pump out small cars to compete with Saturn .                @ @ @ @ @
