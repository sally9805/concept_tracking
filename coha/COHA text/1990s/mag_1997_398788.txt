An unexpected tragedy , a natural disaster , the limits of poverty ... What makes some families survive stress or hardship while others split apart ? // GIVEN TIE MANY PRESSURES FAMILIES FACE TODAY , UNDERSTANDING what holds them together can offer important clues to what makes a healthy family tick . Here 's how three families endured the most difficult kinds of adversity and came through stronger than before . FATHER 'S DAY , 1995 . NANCY AND ED ARBAS WERE celebrating the day with their daughters , Alia , then 14 , and Audra , 11 , on the Gulf of Mexico . Just as the family was falling into a sun-drenched vacation calm , disaster struck . While Ed was moving his sailboat across a road , the mast caught on an overhead electrical wire . He and a friend were electrocuted . Both were killed instantly . After the initial trauma , Nancy , a nurse who 's used to dealing with crises objectively , thought , " Oh , my God , I ca n't believe my kids have to go through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack when she was only 14 . Luckily Nancy , now 46 , and her girls had a solid bond to fall back on , and it served them well . Both she and Ed had been involved parents . " We shared everything fiftyfifty , " says Nancy , the nurse manager at the Canyon Ranch spa , in Tucson , AZ . Ed , a university professor , cooked dinner for the family each night and took the girls to the dentist and to swim meets . " Every night he told us he loved us , " Audra remembers . Photograph Nancy Arbas anchors her daughters , Alia left ) and Audra . " The important thing was to keep Ed alive in our hearts . " she says // Nancy knew it was important for her children to have an opportunity to mourn . Right after the accident , she had Ed 's body brought down to the beach . She took her children aside and said , " This is the last time you 'll get to see your dad . " With the ocean behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls said good-bye . Tough as it sounds , the children now thank their mother for those last moments with their dad . " It was the best gift she could have given me , " Audra says , even though at the time she did not want to go . " The important thing was to keep Ed alive in our hearts , " Nancy says now . When Nancy 's own father died , her mother clammed up . " No one talked about it until I was an adult . As a child , I never even cried . " She let her own kids know they could talk about their father and what had happened as much as they needed . She blew up pictures of Ed from early in the Mexico trip , and put them around the house . And soon after his death , Nancy bought a Southwestern-style kitchen table that Ed had coveted ; when the family sat at the table for meals , they felt his presence . Because of her own childhood experience , Nancy knew that losing a parent when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although she was suffering , she hung tough . " Since I did n't fall apart and our family held together , the girls understood that they would survive , that life goes on , and ultimately they will be fine . " What was most important during that first difficult year ? " Staying connected to each other , " says Nancy . A month after the accident , she took her daughters on a trip to Yosemite that the family had planned together before Ed died . At a time when all three could have become isolated in their grief , they were able to stay close as a family . Says Nancy , " We learned we could be independentbut we also discovered that we could depend on each other . Knowing that has drawn us closer together . " WHEN THE FLOOD WATERS began to spill over the banks of the Red River in Grand Forks , ND , last April , Roger and Delane Johnson did n't flinch-not at first . " Never in a million years did we think the water would reach our home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good two and a half miles from the river . " But as nature took its course that soggy spring , the Johnsons began to lose their cool . On April 19 , with the river perilously rising , Delane and her daughters , Sarah , Il , and Allison , 8 , headed to a friend 's house in Devils Lake , 90 miles away . Roger followed the next day . The Johnsons thought they 'd be gone for the weekend ; they were there for five weeks . " We felt like we were in a war , " recalls Delane of those first weeks of dislocation . " There was that same sense of being lost . " The family stayed glued to the television for news about the damage to their city and their home . " It was awful to watch our city burn , " Delane says , referring to the day downtown Grand Forks succumbed to a raging fire . Fortunately , the Johnsons were staying with close friends rather than in a shelter , as were some of their neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed to , pout in their rooms , or even have a small tantrum . They admit that their friends were respectful of their difficult situation , yet even with such support , the girls at first had a hard time adjusting . Allison had trouble sleeping in a strange home , so Delane would snuggle with her until she felt safe enough to rest . The Johnsons encouraged their kids to talk openly about their fears , believing that would make them less anxious than being expected to act tough . Another helpful antidote for the children : school . The Monday after the family arrived in Devils Lake , both Allison and Sarah went off to a local school , and finished out the year there . Though the switch was disorienting at first , it turned out to be the best thing for them . " Otherwise they would have been at home watching the adults cry , " says Delane . Moreover , the children in Devils Lake sent out a warm welcome to the 74 flood-refugee children attending the elementary schools . They brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was very moving to see so much caring from people we did n't even know , " says Delane . When the Johnsons were finally able to return to their home on May 24 , their happiness was mixed . Their two-story town house was still standing , but almost everything in the basement and on the first floor had been destroyed by the rising tide . The family lost all their living- and dining-room furniture ; their kitchen cabinets and appliances were ruined . Not only were all of the kids ' toys gone , but the wooden toy box their grandfather had made for them was as well . What helped the Johnsons accept their losses ? Taking a look around them : Many of their friends were suffering similar losses , or worse . Some people 's homes had been totally destroyed . Photograph Facing the challenge together ( clockwise from left ) : Sarah , Roger , Delane , and Allison Johnson // That summer the Johnsons , who are both social workers , braced their kids for the difficult days ahead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on in our lives . That has always worked in our family . " They told the children outright , " Expect us to be crabbier than usual . " The warning ( along with assurances that the situation was temporary ) helped the girls accept the frustrations of their disrupted life . Though the nightmare of the flood is over , there 's a lot of hard work to be done as the family tries to rebuild their home , with the girls pitching in to help with repairs . But the Johnsons have come away with a powerful sense of their ability to persevere . " This is the first crisis Roger and I have had to face , " says Delane , " and I think we 've borne it well . " FRESH OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL , Cassandra Rauch Davis , now 29 , wanted what many young women want : to go to college , get married , and have a family . But when she became pregnant at 20 , her life took a different turn . She figured the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby would draw us closer , " she remembers . But after her son , Joseph , was born , her boyfriend took off . " It hurt me , " Cassandra says . " I wanted my son to have a father . " Devastated , Cassandra took a hard look at her options . She was living with her mother in Phipps Lambert Houses , a property subsidized by public and private funds in the South Bronx , NY . With just a high school degree , her work opportunities were limited . Plus , she wanted to stay home and raise her child herself . She did n't want to ask her mother to support her , so she applied for welfare and was granted public financial assistance of $572 a monthjust enough to cover a portion of her mom 's rent , as well as food and clothing for herself and her son . She collected welfare checks for the next seven years . But the aid , meant to lend support for her child and help Cassandra be a better parent , ultimately backfired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I sat at home all day . I never even picked up a book . " When Joseph was 4 , he asked if he could join a free after-school program sponsored by Lambert Houses . Cassandra checked it out and decided to let Joseph participate . Through Lambert Houses , Cassandra met Alice JamesJenkins , the director of family services for all of the Phipps Bronx housing sites . " Alice got me involved in the community , " Cassandra says , inviting her to help out during volunteer activities like cleanup projects and food drives . James-Jenkins then encouraged Cassandra to enroll in HIPPY ( Home-Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters ) to help with her parenting skills . Cassandra did so well that James-Jenkins suggested she apply for a job in the program . Cassandra was chosen from among 50 applicants for a part-time position . Three years later she moved into her own apartment and was off welfare . " It was a matter of showing Cassandra her own strength , that she was worth something , " says James-Jenkins . Cassandra now has a full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . She has a roster of 13 low-income and welfare families she visits weekly to teach basic parenting and learning skills , as well as early-childhood development . Happy about her new independence , Cassandra wants to continue her education . She 'd like to go to Lehman College in the Bronx to study computer science . Last year she married her longtime boyfriend , Mark Davis , the father of her two younger children , Kayron , 5 , and Malaka , 3 . Welfare , Cassandra admits , helped her raise her son Joseph , now 9 years old , and get through those first few lonely years . But eventually , she says , " I wanted a better life : a job , my own place , to stand on my own two feet . " Moreover , she wanted to create a solid family for her children . " I 'm setting an example for my kids not to expect something for nothing , " she says . " They see me doing something better for myself and for them , " Cassandra says firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send your children .
