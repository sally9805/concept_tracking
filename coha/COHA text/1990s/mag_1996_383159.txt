WHEN FLEXIBILITY decreases and the length of your backswing becomes shorter , creating power through hand action becomes more important . Your wrist cock , therefore , demands perfection . Because it plays a major role in your swing , there is no room for extraneous or unnecessary movement . The three-step drill is a popular way to ensure that your wrists reach the proper position at the top of the swing , so they can uncock with maximum force : Assume your normal address with a 5-iron . First , without changing your spine angle , lift the club and let the shaft rest on your right shoulder . Then make as big a turn as possible so the clubhead points at the target . Lastly , lift your arms in the air to reach a top-of-the-swing position . If you follow all three steps , your wrists will be fully cocked . Try this drill several times , then try to reach the same position making a normal backswing . If you can , you 'll have an efficient , power-producing wrist cock . Crisper Irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Nothing dramatic perhaps , but greens in regulation seem to drop as scores start to rise . Everything may feel the same , but your medium- and short-iron approach shots are n't as crisp as they were a few months ago . During the year , the swing tends to loosen up a bit ; in this case , it 's probably too loose . Here 's how to tighten the screws and return to a crisper feeling on your approach shots . " TRAPPING " THE KEY TO CRISPER IRONS is " trapping " the ball : making contact on a slightly descending path so the clubface pinches the ball against the turf . This produces a lower trajectory that rises toward the end of its flight before falling softly to the green . Small , shallow divots are preferred ; they indicate that a descending blow was made while the clubhead approached impact from the inside . When better players lose that action on approach shots , it usually means one of two things : the clubhead is sweeping into impact , indicating that you are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chopping motion , indicating that your hands are too far ahead of the ball , substantially delofting the club . ' STAY ON TOP OF THE BALL GOOD IRON PLAY requires your body to be centered over the ball throughout the swing , with very little lateral motion away from the target on the backswing or toward it on the downswing . Take your swing through a checklist to make sure there 's no unnecessary movement : ADDRESS : Weight is evenly distributed between left and right foot ; on shorter irons , you may even favor the left side a bit . BACKSWING : Work on turning your back to the target while keeping your left foot flat on the ground . Your right leg and hip should brace you at the top of the swing , but your body stays " on top , " directly over the ball . // You have lost some flexibility and distance , but still have the capability to shoot low scores . // You have a sound ll around game , but you 'd like to shave those last few strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; clear the left hip out of the way and let your hands swing left of the target after impact . Finish with your body erect and your weight on your left foot . All About Alignment FAULTY ALIGNMENT can ruin your shot before you swing the club . Aiming the body somewhere other than parallel to the target makes a good swing bad and a bad swing worse . // DRILL DOWNHILL LIES // Examples : 1 ) A low handicapper with a solid swing gets sloppy and starts aiming left of the target . He ca n't figure out why his shots tailhook to the left , so he tries to prevent the clubface from releasing through impact and loses distance . Good swing gone bad . 2 ) A golfer who cuts across the ball from outside in and slices begins aiming right of the target to encourage an inside-out swing and a draw . He pulls the club inside the target line on the backswing , but then loops it over the top and cuts across the ball even more , resulting in a bigger slice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't require physical skill or years of experience , just care . Here 's how : LEARN WHAT SQUARE IS YOU MAY KNOW THAT proper alignment means setting your feet , knees , hips , shoulders , and clubface square to the target line . But do you know what it feels like ? Maybe not . It 's very common for amateurs ( and pros , too ) to drift or twist themselves unknowingly into faulty alignment positions . That 's why it 's crucial that your body recognizes how square feels . Lay a club on the ground and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart , parallel to the shaft . Take another club and make an imaginary address position : knees flexed , bent forward slightly from the hips , back straight , arms hanging from shoulders . Without changing your body position , lay the club in your hands across your knees . Is it parallel to the club on the ground ? It should be . Do the same for your hips and shoulders ; this will show if your body has a " feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts with the clubface ; get that square and the rest of your body will follow more easily . Begin by standing behind the ball , on a straight line with the target . To make squaring the clubface easier , pick a spot-a leaf , divot , whatever-that 's on the target line and no more than a couple feet in front of the ball . This is your target during the set-up . Walk around and put the club behind the ball so the clubface is perpendicular to the target line , facing the intermediate spot you chose . Take your grip , then align your feet perpendicular to the clubface and parallel to the target line . Once your feet are square , your knees , hips , and shoulders should fall into place . Check yourself against the intermediate target and the actual target , then swing away . Read Your Pitches JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY crouches behind the ball and reads the break of their putt . But do you take the time to read chips and pitches ? You should . Because distance is not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chips and pitches have more variables ( carry , bounce , roll ) to worry about than any other shot , so it 's unrealistic to think you can merely " hit at the hole . " Maximize your scoring opportunities by considering some of the following factors on your chips and pitches . THE LINE THE ROLL ON YOUR CHIP AND PITCH is as important as the carry and bounce , so go the extra step and read the break from your intended landing spot to the hole . Unless the situation is extreme , every short shot is makeable . Treat them that way . BEST SIDE OF THE CUP AT THE SAME TIME , try to leave yourself the easiest possible putt . A three-foot circle around the hole is nice , but suppose you leave the ball five feet away . Would you rather that five-footer be a downhill slider or straight uphill ? Rather than just trying to get the ball inside a circle , imagine a half circle-the half below the cup-and try to hit the ball there . BUNKER HUMPS FEW THINGS ARE MORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a bunker only to have it kick off the backside and shoot across the green , way past the hole . This misfortune can be avoided simply by being careful . If you 're facing a shot over a bunker , check the other side . Very often there will be a hump on the green that can springboard your ball past the hole . In these cases , consider the hump part of the bunker and play a higher , softer-landing shot that rolls less . WIND AND GRAIN : SPIN FACTORS PLAYERS OFTEN SURPRISE THEMSELVES with how much or how little a pitch shot will spin under certain circumstances . Having a good lie and solid contact does n't always guarantee the ball will spin . Often the wind direction and the grain of the green play a part . All greens are different , depending upon wetness , length of grass , and other factors , but the basic idea is this : Do n't expect a ball to spin if it 's landing with the grain or with the wind . If your shot is downgrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a delicate pitch-and-run . Similarly , hitting into the grain and/or wind will reduce roll . Be aware before you play your shot so you can adjust accordingly . Press and Go POWER HITTERS , who normally go full bore on every swing , often fall into a mental trap on the green . When the pressure 's on , you say to yourself , " Make a smooth backswing and do n't rush . " Invariably , you take the club back on a herky-jerky path and miss the putt . It 's not that you 're incapable of a smooth stroke , it 's just that your mind has done a number on you . Break this negative thought pattern by focusing on a different physical action . Instead of thinking about how to move the putter back , focus on starting the motion with a forward press of your hands . This slight movement toward the hole accomplishes two things : First , it gets you thinking about the target rather than the stroke , which frees your mind ; second , it sets your hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . // You have the potential for a better game but first you need to solve some fundamental problems . // You keep the ball in play most of the time , but a lack of distance puts pressure on your game . // When you make a forward press , the backswing happens naturally as an extension of the initial movement . You 'll spend less time thinking about your stroke and more on rolling the ball into the hole . // POWER HITTER You hit the ball a long way but rarely as straight as you want . Your game needs control and consistency . // <p>
