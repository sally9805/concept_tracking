Coalwood Until I began to build and launch rockets , I did n't know my hometown was at war with itself over its children and that my parents were locked in a kind of bloodless combat over how my brother and I would live our lives . I did n't know that if a girl broke your heart , another girl , virtuous at least in spirit , could mend it on the same night . And I did n't know that the enthalpy decrease in a converging passage could be transformed into jet kinetic energy if a divergent passage was added . The other boys discovered their own truths when we built our rockets , but those were mine . Coalwood , West Virginia , where I grew up , was built for the purpose of extracting the millions of tons of rich , bituminous coal that lay beneath it . In 1957 , when I was fourteen years old and first began to build my rockets , there were nearly two thousand people living in Coalwood . My father , Homer Hickam , was the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards from the mine 's entrance , a vertical shaft eight hundred feet deep . From the window of my bedroom , I could see the black steel tower that sat over the shaft and the comings and goings of the men who worked at the mine . Another shaft , with railroad tracks leading up to it , was used to bring out the coal . The structure for lifting , sorting , and dumping the coal was called the tipple . Every weekday , and even on Saturday when times were good , I could watch the black coal cars rolling beneath the tipple to receive their massive loads and then smoke-spouting locomotives straining to pull them away . All through the day , the heavy thump of the locomotives ' steam pistons thundered down our narrow valleys , the town shaking to the crescendo of grinding steel as the great trains accelerated . Clouds of coal dust rose from the open cars , invading everything , seeping through windows and creeping under doors . Throughout my childhood , when I raised my blanket in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My socks were always black with coal dirt when I took my shoes off at night . Our house , like every house in Coalwood , was company-owned . The company charged a small monthly rent , automatically deducted from the miners ' pay . Some of the houses were tiny and single-storied , with only one or two bedrooms . Others were big two-story duplexes , built as boardinghouses for bachelor miners in the booming 1920 's and later sectioned off as individual-family dwellings during the Depression . Every five years , all the houses in Coalwood were painted a company white , which the blowing coal soon tinged gray . Usually in the spring , each family took it upon themselves to scrub the exterior of their house with hoses and brushes . Each house in Coalwood had a fenced-off square of yard . My mother , having a larger yard than most to work with , planted a rose garden . She hauled in dirt from the mountains by the sackful , slung over her shoulder , and fertilized , watered , and manicured each bush with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rewarded with bushes filled with great blood-red blossoms as well as dainty pink and yellow buds , spatters of brave color against the dense green of the heavy forests that surrounded us and the gloom of the black and gray mine just up the road . Our house was on a corner where the state highway turned east toward the mine . A company-paved road went the other way to the center of town . Main Street , as it was called , ran down a valley so narrow in places that a boy with a good arm could throw a rock from one side of it to the other . Every day for the three years before I went to high school , I got on my bicycle in the morning with a big white canvas bag strapped over my shoulder and delivered the Bluefield Daily Telegraph down this valley , pedaling past the Coalwood School and the rows of houses that were set along a little creek and up on the sides of the facing mountains . A mile down Main was a large hollow in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company offices and also the company church , a company hotel called the Club House , the post office building , which also housed the company doctor and the company dentist , and the main company store ( which everybody called the Big Store ) . On an overlooking hill was the turreted mansion occupied by the company general superintendent , a man sent down by our owners in Ohio to keep an eye on their assets . Main Street continued westward between two mountains , leading to clusters of miners ' houses we called Middletown and Frog Level . Two forks led up mountain hollows to the " colored " camps of Mudhole and Snakeroot . There the pavement ended , and rutted dirt roads began . At the entrance to Mudhole was a tiny wooden church presided over by the Reverend " Little " Richard . He was dubbed " Little " because of his resemblance to the soul singer . Nobody up Mudhole Hollow subscribed to the paper , but whenever I had an extra one , I always left it at the little church , and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I loved it when he had a moment to come out on the church porch and tell me a quick Bible story while I listened , astride my bike , fascinated by his sonorous voice . I especially admired his description of Daniel in the lions ' den . When he acted out with bug-eyed astonishment the moment Daniel 's captors looked down and saw their prisoner lounging around in the pit with his arm around the head of a big lion , I laughed appreciatively . " That Daniel , he knew the Lord , " the Reverend summed up with a chuckle while I continued to giggle , " and it made him brave . How about you , Sonny ? Do you know the Lord ? " I had to admit I was n't certain about that , but the Reverend said it was all right . " God looks after fools and drunks , " he said with a big grin that showed off his gold front tooth , " and I guess he 'll look after you too , Sonny Hickam . " Many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble , I would think of Reverend Richard and his belief in God 's sense of humor and His fondness for ne'er-do-wells . It did n't make me as brave as old Daniel , but it always gave me at least a little hope the Lord would let me scrape by . The company church , the one most of the white people in town went to , was set down on a little grassy knob . In the late 1950 's , it came to be presided over by a company employee , Reverend Josiah Lanier , who also happened to be a Methodist . The denomination of the preacher the company hired automatically became ours too . Before we became Methodists , I remember being a Baptist and , once for a year , some kind of Pentecostal . The Pentecostal preacher scared the women , hurling fire and brimstone and warnings of death from his pulpit . When his contract expired , we got Reverend Lanier . I was proud to live in Coalwood . According to the West Virginia history books , no one had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to dig out the coal . Up until the early nineteenth century , Cherokee tribes occasionally hunted in the area , but found the terrain otherwise too rugged and uninviting . Once , when I was eight years old , I found a stone arrowhead embedded in the stump of an ancient oak tree up on the mountain behind my house . My mother said a deer must have been lucky some long ago day . I was so inspired by my find that I invented an Indian tribe , the Coalhicans , and convinced the boys I played with-Roy Lee , O'Dell , Tony , and Sherman-that it had really existed . They joined me in streaking our faces with berry juice and sticking chicken feathers in our hair . For days afterward , our little tribe of savages formed raiding parties and conducted massacres throughout Coalwood . We surrounded the Club House and , with birch-branch bows and invisible arrows , picked off the single miners who lived there as they came in from work . To indulge us , some of them even fell down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn . When we set up an ambush at the tipple gate , the miners going on shift got into the spirit of things , whooping and returning our imaginary fire . My father observed this from his office by the tipple and came out to restore order . Although the Coalhicans escaped into the hills , their chief was reminded at the supper table that night that the mine was for work , not play . When we ambushed some older boys-my brother , Jim , among them-who were playing cowboys up in the mountains , a great mock battle ensued until Tony , up in a tree for a better line of sight , stepped on a rotted branch and fell and broke his arm . I organized the construction of a litter out of branches , and we bore the great warrior home . The company doctor , " Doc " Lassiter , drove to Tony 's house in his ancient Packard and came inside . When he caught sight of us still in our feathers and war paint , Doc said he was the " heap big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in a cast . I remember still what I wrote on it : Tony-next time pick a better tree . Tony 's Italian immigrant father was killed in the mine that same year . He and his mother left and we never heard from them again . This did not seem unusual to me : A Coalwood family required a father , one who worked for the company . The company and Coalwood were one and the same . I learned most of what I knew about Coalwood history and my parents ' early years at the kitchen table after the supper dishes were cleared . That was when Mom had herself a cup of coffee and Dad a glass of milk , and if they were n't arguing about one thing or the other , they would talk about the town and the people in it , what was going on at the mine , what had been said at the last Women 's Club meeting , and , sometimes , little stories about how things used to be . Brother Jim usually got bored and asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tales . Mr. George L. Carter , the founder of Coalwood , came in on the back of a mule in 1887 , finding nothing but wilderness and , after he dug a little , one of the richest seams of bituminous coal in the world . Seeking his fortune , Mr. Carter bought the land from its absentee owners and began construction of a mine . He also built houses , school buildings , churches , a company store , a bakery , and an icehouse . He hired a doctor and a dentist and provided their services to his miners and their families for free . As the years passed and his coal company prospered , Mr. Carter had concrete sidewalks poured , the streets paved , and the town fenced to keep cows from roaming the streets . Mr. Carter wanted his miners to have a decent place to live . But in return , he asked for a decent day 's work . Coalwood was , after all , a place for work above all else : hard , bruising , filthy , and sometimes deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War I , he brought with him his army commander , a Stanford University graduate of great engineering and social brilliance named William Laird , who everyone in town called , with the greatest respect and deference , the Captain . The Captain , a big expansive man who stood nearly six and a half feet tall , saw Coalwood as a laboratory for his ideas , a place where the company could bring peace , prosperity , and tranquillity to its citizens . From the moment Mr. Carter hired him and placed him in charge of operations , the Captain began to implement the latest in mining technology . Shafts were sunk for ventilation , and as soon as it was practical , the mules used to haul out the coal from the mine were replaced by electric motors . Later , the Captain stopped all the hand digging and brought in giant machines , called continuous miners , to tear the coal from its seams . The Captain expanded Mr. Carter 's building program , providing every Coalwood miner a house with indoor plumbing , a Warm Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company kept full . For the town 's water supply , he tapped into a pristine ancient lake that lay a thousand feet below . He built parks on both ends of the town and funded the Boy Scouts , Girl Scouts , Brownies , Cub Scouts , and the Women 's Club . He stocked the Coalwood school library and built a school playground and a football field . Because the mountains interfered with reception , in 1954 he erected an antenna on a high ridge and provided one of the first cable television systems in the United States as a free service . Although it was n't perfect , and there was always tension between the miners and the company , mostly about pay , Coalwood was , for a time , spared much of the violence , poverty , and pain of the other towns in southern West Virginia . I remember sitting on the stairs in the dark listening to my father 's father-my Poppy-talk to Dad in our living room about " bloody Mingo , " a county just up the road from us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out between union miners and company " detectives . " Dozens of people were killed and hundreds were wounded in pitched battles with machine guns , pistols , and rifles . To get away from the violence , Poppy moved his family first to Harlan County , Kentucky , and then , when battles erupted there , to McDowell County , where he went to work in the Gary mine . It was an improvement , but Gary was still a place of strikes and lockouts and the occasional bloody head . In 1934 , when he was twenty-two years old , my father applied for work as a common miner with Mr. Carter 's company . He came because he had heard that a man could make a good life for himself in Coalwood . Almost immediately , the Captain saw something in the skinny , hungry lad from Gary-some spark of raw intelligence , perhaps-and took him as a protg . After a couple of years , the Captain raised Dad to section foreman , taught him how to lead men and operate and ventilate a mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Dad became a foreman , he convinced his father to quit the Gary mine and move to Coalwood , where there was no union and a man could work . He also wrote Elsie Lavender , a Gary High School classmate who had moved on her own to Florida , to come back to West Virginia and marry him . She refused . Whenever the story was told , Mom took over at this point and said the letter she next received was from the Captain , who told her how much Dad loved her and needed her , and would she please stop being so stubborn down there in the palm trees and come to Coalwood and marry the boy ? She agreed to come to Coalwood to visit , and one night at the movies in Welch , when Dad asked her to marry him again , she said if he had a Brown Mule chewing tobacco wrapper in his pocket , she 'd do it . He had one and she said yes . It was a decision that I believed she often regretted , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine until 1943 , when a runaway mine car cut off both his legs at the hip .
