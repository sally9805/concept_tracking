<p> When Cauleen Smith 's parents moved from the Jim Crow South to Sacramento some 30 years ago , they were determined that their children 's lives would not be limited by the color of their skin . <p> But their plans to raise a family in a color-blind society backfired when Cauleen ventured beyond the insulation of home . She found that life in an integrated neighborhood and school presented a range of problems that no one had prepared her to face . <p> " My parents grew up in really isolated black communities , " said Smith , 24 , a San Francisco film maker . " In the South , the rules were clear . .. . It was difficult to decipher what we kids in an integrated society were being told . They did n't give me any armor . " <p> Decades ago , when civil rights advocates were fighting for equality , they seldom considered the process of social integration that would follow once blacks and whites began to interact more freely . Now , young blacks who have benefited from desegregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its next phase : attacking the tenacious roots of racism that remain alive in American culture a generation after segregation was officially outlawed . <p> " This is a multicentury struggle , not just multigenerational , " said Roger Wilkins , 59 , a historian at George Mason University and the nephew of the late civil rights leader Roy Wilkins . <p> For the heirs to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . ' s " dream " who live , work and play in integrated environments , the struggle to be judged as individuals by " the content of their character " continues . <p> " We were very , very naive , " said Wilkins . " We thought that segregation was the box that we were in . We thought if we could get rid of that , there would be acceptance . . . . We had no idea how deep and pervasive American racism is  --  everybody is afflicted by it . " <p> Blacks who have been educated and employed in predominantly white institutions make up a small but significant portion of the black population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the dearest dreams of the civil rights movement . <p> Today , the challenge takes new forms . In the broadest sense , many young blacks say this means channeling their energies so that others can share their benefits . As examples of this commitment , they point to their work  --  everything from presenting different black images in film to fighting pollution in their neighborhoods to helping students get law degrees . <p> SUBTLER BATTLE <p> But perhaps the more difficult task left to them is achieving the twin goals of defining themselves in a more fluid society and addressing the subtle but persistent racial tension that underlies everyday life . <p> " In the past , the fight was such a clear one  --  getting basic needs fulfilled , " Smith said . " Now that we have all of this , we 're being told , ' You have access , why do you still have problems ? ' It 's a foggier situation today . " <p> Gerald Jaynes , professor of economics and chairman of the African and Afro American studies at Yale University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in offices everywhere . <p> " Young people are talking about it all the time , " he said . " They are talking about the difficulties of being a minority , of being stereotyped , concerned with their tastes and cultures dominated all the time , not fitting in , people not treating them the same . " <p> Ellie Goodwin , 37 , is an outreach coordinator for the Natural Resources Defense Council . Her job is to bridge the gap between the council and minorities dealing with environmental problems in their neighborhoods . But as one of the few people of color in her office , Goodwin said she feels that her white co-workers often hold her at arm 's length emotionally . <p> ' RIPPING AND RUNNING ' <p> " I think I make them a little nervous , " she said . " I hear them ripping and running through the office , making their little jokes , but I 'm not someone they joke around with a lot . People of color tend not to get mixed in , which is why we tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation , Goodwin sees a positive side . " They watch their words with me  --  what they say , how they say it  --  to make sure it 's not paternalistic . If I make them nervous and that makes them think , that 's good . " <p> Young black professionals describe the veiled racial exclusion they experience as part of a continuum of racial inequity that manifests itself in more devastating ways : More blacks are going to early graves and jail cells , but not enough are getting good educations and good jobs . <p> " I think there are a lot of questions lingering for a lot of people , " said Jake Lamar , a writer in Ann Arbor , Mich . " ' What is your real responsibility ? ' ' Do you ever feel like an outsider ? ' ' Do you serve the community in a way that is just ? ' ' How do you decide what the concerns of the community are ? ' The racial , the personal and the political are extremely intertwined . " <p> In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamar , 30 , contrasts his experiences as a student at Harvard and a staff writer at Time magazine with those of his father , a self-made man who scrabbled his way from poverty and segregation in Georgia to positions of influence in New York . <p> TENURE AT TIME <p> During much of his six-year tenure at Time , Lamar was the only black writer in the New York office . Although no one called him a " nigger " or tried to lock him out of the washroom , Lamar said he was aware of an unsettling difference in the way many of his white colleagues dealt with him  --  a phenomenon he calls " cryptoracism . " <p> Part of the problem is that few people think that a racist could be the guy next door or at the next desk , Lamar said . When most people think of racists , they imagine men in white hoods burning crosses on Southern lawns . <p> " Someone can be patronizing and rude , but you ca n't prove he 's a racist , " Lamar said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can manifest themselves as racism . This presents a particularly thorny problem in friendships between blacks and whites . <p> " You could fill a book with these little comments . They 're all very good friends . They like you . You think they see you as an individual , " said Leslie Farrell , 34 , a San Francisco documentary producer . <p> Even friends who have known Farrell since she was the lone black hippie in her class at Berkeley High School expect her to be an authority on everything from Jesse Jackson to jeri-curls  --  Michael Jackson 's old hairstyle . <p> " We 're watching this show and they have this black singing group on , " she recalled . " One of the guys had a jeri-curl . This white friend turned to me and said , ' Why do black men wear shower caps ? ' <p> " I said , ' You 've known me for 15 years . You 've seen all of my friends and none of them wear shower caps . Why do you think I would know ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most overwhelming problems that young blacks speak of is the desire to be seen as " just Jake , " " just Ellie , " " just Leslie "  --  unique beings distinct from some mythical black identity . <p> While the shared , universal experience of segregation served to galvanize previous generations of black Americans , no single issue unifies all blacks today . Many young blacks said they resent the media 's tendency to hold up individuals like Spike Lee or Shelby Steel as spokesmen for some nonexistent " black perspective . " <p> " There are as many different black consciousnesses as there are black people , " said Lamar . " There is no generic black consciousness . " <p> Other blacks spoke of the grim side of being taken as a representative of a whole race  --  especially a race with a generally negative mainstream image . <p> " Black men are a threat . Black women are the help , " said outreach coordinator Goodwin , who said white strangers often treat her as if she were a servant . <p> Historian Wilkins said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear when they saw a black man on the street . <p> " Black people were much more submissive , " he said . " Any black person who stepped out of line would have been dealt with . It 's a lot different today . " <p> COMMON STORY <p> Indeed , young black men tell a common story of how white strangers nervously recoil when they approach them on the street . <p> " I 'm a 6-foot-2 black man with dreads , " said Anthony Jones , a law student at Yale . " When I 'm walking down the street , white people cross to the other side . Police officers walk up and ask me questions . That 's part of being a young black man in America . <p> " Racist incidents are never less outrageous because of their frequency , but you do get used to people thinking that you are a thug because of the amount of light you reflect , " he said . <p> Young blacks respond to these incidents with a mixture of anger and confusion . Although earlier generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them few blueprints for building a life in an integrated world . <p> " They told us that we were as good as anybody else , that race did n't matter , " Cauleen Smith said . " Well , it does matter . " <p> When Smith was in the third grade , she got in trouble for beating up the principal 's daughter . <p> " She called me a nigger , and I beat her up , " said Smith . " Later , I was crying in class and this little boy asked me why , and I said , ' Because Jessica called me a nigger and I beat her up . ' He said , ' You are a nigger . ' There I was , being called a ' nigger ' two times in less than an hour , and I felt totally powerless . " <p> As an adult , Smith has tried to come to terms with this episode in her film work . " Everyone knows what it means to be called a nigger , but how the reaction manifests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women internalize it . There are no acceptable models . "
