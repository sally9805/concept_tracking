<p> LAREDO  --  The " " juice " tastes a little like iced tea that does n't have quite enough sugar and lemon in it to cut the bitterness . <p> Anything cold would probably taste good under the relentless sun in the U.S. Customs Service " " impound lot " near International Bridge No. 1 <p> But this cocktail of water , maple syrup , lemon , electrolytes , salt and baking soda  --  with side orders of plain water and Gatorade  --  has been breakfast , lunch and dinner for 2 1/2 weeks for nine protesters living in a school bus . <p> They say they 'll leave  --  and eat solid foods again  --  only after the U.S. government lets them ship the " " little yellow school bus " to a church in Havana . Customs officials are enforcing a 31-year-old trade embargo against Fidel Castro 's communist nation , and say they will allow only humanitarian aid . <p> And under the embargo law , buses do not constitute humanitarian aid . <p> " " It 's not a democracy , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Castro could take a liking to that little yellow school bus . " <p> She would like nothing more than to see the group , Pastors for Peace , leave the lot , a stiflingly hot and noisy strip of asphalt crowded with 18-wheelers awaiting inspection before they drive over the bridge to Mexico . <p> But with a combination of determination and an extraordinary amount of leniency from the federal officials who want them to leave , Pastors for Peace members have stayed since July 29th in a nonviolent protest against the embargo . <p> The school bus is secondary : What they really want , they say , is an end to the embargo . <p> The Cuban embargo began during the Kennedy administration , and tougher sanctions were signed into law by then-President Bush late last year . <p> Cuba obviously survived the first three decades of the trade ban , but with the cutoff of aid from the now-defunct Soviet Union , Castro 's people have begun to suffer . Reports from Cuba indicate severe shortages of food , medicine , fuel and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cuba has eased some under President Clinton , but the embargo remains in place . Pastors for Peace leaders are trying to tear it down . <p> " " It 's a matter of principle , " said Tom Hansen , director of the Minneapolis-based group . " " They do n't have the right to stop churches in America from sending anything to churches in Cuba . <p> " " It 's a violation of international law . It 's a violation of human rights . We have to stand up to a policy like that . " <p> So , for the second time this year , a law enforcement arm of the U.S. Treasury Department finds itself in a standoff in Texas . <p> This is not by any imaginative stretch a repeat of the confrontation with the Branch Davidians in Waco . There are no guns involved , no children and no self-proclaimed messiahs . <p> But some Customs officers say privately that fear of another hostile encounter prevented them from arresting the protesters on the first day . <p> Others say they just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They refused to leave , and shut themselves up in the bus and that 's how it all began , " said Judy Turner , a spokeswoman in the regional Customs office in Houston . " " Our district director made attempts repeatedly to get them to come out of the bus , and they would not do it . <p> " " We definitely looked at options and decided we were not going to get into the confrontational mode at that time and elected to proceed with just a very slow methodical way of looking at it and seeing what our options might be . " <p> Pastors for Peace is an offshoot of the New York-based Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization . Both were founded by the Rev. Lucius Walker Jr . of Brooklyn , N.Y. , who was driving the school bus in Laredo when Customs stopped it . <p> The July caravan to Cuba is the group 's second to that country . The first , also through Laredo , resulted in five arrests . <p> And Pastors for Peace and Customs have tangled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid to Nicaragua and four to El Salvador in the late 1980s . <p> This time , Walker said , he was somewhat surprised that he and his fellow hunger strikers were not arrested . <p> " " That 's what I probably would have done if I were in their shoes , " he said . <p> He said the organizers of the caravan , which he said carried 100 tons of aid , were not seeking a confrontation in Laredo . <p> " " We did n't ask to be here , but this is the hand they dealt us , " Walker said . " " Our faith obligates us to play that hand . <p> " " This is a gift they gave us , " he said . " " We 're getting more mileage out of sitting on this compound right now than if the bus was in Cuba . " <p> The conditions are bad , but they could be worse . <p> Afternoon high temperatures have remained above 100 degrees , reaching above 105 degrees for several days in a row . Trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honking their horns in frustration at the long waits that are standard at the state 's busiest border crossing . <p> On the first day , the protesters had to stay on their bus . <p> Gradually , they 've been allowed to walk around the lot and to rest and sleep in the shade of a covered loading dock . A small group of Customs officers watches from an air-conditioned mobile home parked near the bus , making sure that no one enters the lot to join in the demonstration . <p> Customs brought in a portable toilet and a 400-gallon tank of water for the protesters . They use the toilet , but refused the water , making a big deal out of offering it to people who live in " " colonias "  --  unincorporated areas with no water and sewer service  --  near Laredo . <p> A " " support team " of about 20 people is allowed to pass water and cellular phones and supplies over the chain-link fence to the hunger strikers . Federal Express and the U.S. Postal Service make regular deliveries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some Gatorade and a gallon of their " " juice . " They shower under a tarpaulin , using a plastic milk carton with dozens of holes punched in it . A doctor examines them every day . <p> " " These are the best check-ups , the most medical attention , I 've had in a long time , " said James McKenna with the Catholic Diocese of Dallas . " " And I have n't felt a pang of hunger since Day 1 . Of course , I had a good breakfast that morning . " <p> Some , like Lisa Vananti of Pittsburgh , admit they 're hungry after so many days of fasting . She said she 's involved in the protest for children in Cuba . <p> " " They have a right to grow up , and they have a right to eat , " she said . " " This is why I 'm sitting in a parking lot with the diesel fumes in a sardine can .

" <p> The heat and hunger became too much for three of the protesters , who were convinced Friday by doctors to leave the bus . <p> They spent the day eating solids in air-conditioned comfort . " " It could take an act of Congress to get them out of there , " Wilcox complained . " " This is an extraordinary situation for Customs . These people are trespassing on that lot . We have some real concerns about their safety , but we did n't want to escalate the situation . " The impounded school bus , a 16-seater with an extra transmission sitting on the floor in the back , was the 89th vehicle in the Pastors for Peace caravan . Two other buses were allowed to cross into Mexico , and Wilcox has a stack of Mexican newspapers in her office with pictures of one bus being loaded onto a Cuba-bound ship in Tampico . <p> " " They said emphatically it was not going to Cuba , " she said . Wilcox said Customs is investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what illegal items were sent . They might file charges , she said . <p> Walker and others on the bus said they do n't understand why they were stopped after volunteers walked several hundred boxes of goods over the bridge and after so many of their vehicles were allowed through . <p> " " If they had done their job to the letter of the law , they would have stopped all of us , " he said . " " I was driving the vehicle . They never asked me where I was going and I never told them where I was going . " <p> Wilcox disputes that assertion , saying Pastors for Peace had " " declared their intent to take that bus to Cuba . " <p> Both sides are waiting for officials with the Office of Foreign Asset Control in Washington to answer a proposal from the protesters . <p> They suggested letting the bus go to Cuba and having a third party  --  the World Council of Churches  --  make sure the bus stays in the hands of the church it is intended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wish , said Bob Levine , a spokesman for Customs in Washington . <p> " " There are certain exceptions for humanitarian donations and whatnot , but motor vehicles is not one of them , " he said . What 's more , Customs does n't consider the proposal an application for a license to send the bus over . <p> " " In any case , it 's unlikely they would license the bus to go through , " Levine said . <p> The caravan had some luck getting prohibited items over the border and into Cuba . <p> " " I had been over several times , " said Chris Hoeppner , an assembly worker at a Kenworth truck plant in Seattle who is now a resident of the parking lot . " " You just put a quarter in the toll and you go across . <p> " " We expressly challenged the embargo law . We did n't ask for a license . " <p> Hoeppner said he carried over computers , prescription medicines and other items that are embargoed . <p> " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " Customs is not able to inspect all boxes that are walked across the border . There 's a helluva lot of traffic across that border . " <p> Some medicines and a few computers were confiscated , along with the bus , officials said . <p> Walker said all of the aid was requested by the churches in Cuba . By his definition , all of what was sent was humanitarian aid . <p> He maintains his group was not trying to create an incident in Laredo and did n't seek a confrontation with Customs . But he admits that getting this particular shipment of aid to Cuba is secondary to getting the embargo lifted . And he clearly hopes to generate pressure on the Clinton administration to lift the blockade . <p> " " With a stroke of his pen , the president could change much of this , " Walker said . " " This could be ended just as Nixon ended the embargo against China . <p> " " Legally , that bus is theirs . Morally , I 'm saying this is despicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civil disobedience means not cooperating with an unjust law . <p> " " We , as people of faith , are responding to a higher law . "
