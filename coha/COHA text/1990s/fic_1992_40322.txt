They were coming : two of them . The trembling began in Mary 's fingertips and ran up her arms into her heart . She must stand her ground . Mr. Young had said stand your ground . He might come . If he came , they would never get past him . She wished Norman would not shake his sign like that . The shaking made the trembling worse . The sign was something Norman had made himself , not one Mr. Young had approved , even . Norman had no right to do everything himself that way . This is a war , Mr. Young said , and we are the army of the Right . We are soldiers . They were coming closer , and the trembling ran down into her legs , but she stood firm , she stood her ground . <p> An old man standing on the sidewalk ahead of them was holding up a sign on a stick , and when he saw them he began to shake it up and down . It had some dark words on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? " Sharee asked , and Delaware said , " Road kill . " A woman popped up beside the man . Delaware thought she might be an escort . She was calling out to them . Sharee asked , " Who 's she ? " and Delaware said , " I do n't know , come on , " because the man was making her nervous . He had started making a kind of chopping motion with the sign , as if he was going to cut them down with the dead possum . The woman was pretty and nicely dressed , but instead of talking softer as they came close she yelled louder  --  " I 'm praying ! I 'm praying for you ! " " Why does n't she go to church ? " Sharee asked . She and Delaware were holding hands now , and they walked faster . The woman danced in front of them like a basketball player trying to stop a shot . Her voice had gone up into a scream , shrill , in Sharee 's face : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ! " To shut out the screaming woman Sharee put her free arm up over her eyes and ducked her head down between her shoulders as they hurried up the four steps of the building . The man was also shouting now . Delaware felt the edge of his signboard strike her shoulder , a terrible feeling , not a pain but a shock , an invasion . It seemed like she had expected it , had known it would happen , but it was so terrible it stopped her and she could not move . Sharee tugged her forward to the metal-framed pebble-glass door of the clinic and pushed at the door . It did not move . Delaware thought it was locked and they were trapped , outside . The door opened outward fast , forcing them back . An angry woman stood there saying , " There 's an injunction against you getting on this property and you 'd better not forget it ! " Sharee let go Delaware 's hand and ducked way down and hid her head in both arms . Delaware looked around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talking to them , " she said to Sharee . " It 's O.K. " She took Sharee 's hand again , and they went inside , past the angry woman , who held the door for them . <p> They were in there now . They had got in . And Pitch Defilement was laughing at him inside the door , standing there laughing . Mary was talking in her squealy voice . Screaming and squealing and devil laughter . Norman raised up his sign and swung it down , driving it edgewise into the grass along the sidewalk in front of the Butcher Shop . Squealy Mary jumped aside and stood staring at him . He pulled the sign out and stood it upright . He felt better . " I 'm going for a cup of coffee , " he told Mary . Walking to the coffee shop , five blocks , carrying his sign erect , he thought all the time of what was going on inside the Butcher Shop . How they laid the girl down and gassed her and spread her legs and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the instruments . Stuck them into her , farther and farther in , grasped and pulled him out quivering and bloody . Stuck the knives up in between her legs and she writhed and moaned , showing her teeth , arching her back , gasping , panting . They pulled him out and he lay limp and little , dead . " God is my witness , " he said aloud , and struck the stick of his sign against the pavement . He would find a way in . He would get in there and do what must be done . <p> The fat woman was behind the counter at the coffee shop . Young but fat , flaunting white , freckled arms . He did n't like the place but it was the only place to get coffee near the clinic . Lists of stuff with foreign names stood on the counter . People in expensive clothes came in and ordered the foreign names . Norman said , " I want a cup of plain American coffee , " as he always did , and Lard Arms nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the coffee shop , she had stopped speaking to him or smiling , and looked at him warily . That was how he wanted it . She put the filled cup on the counter . He put down exact change , took the cup to a table by the window , propping his sign up against the glass , and sat down . He felt tired . His hip hurt again , the grinding ache , and the coffee tasted weak and bitter . He stared at his sign . A long , curling hair , caught in the rough wooden edge , shimmered bright as gold wire in the sunlight coming through the glass . He reached out to pull it off . He could not feel it between his fingers , stiff and half-numbed from carrying the sign all morning . <p> They went in front of the reception desk and the angry woman went behind it . She said to Delaware , " You 're Sharee . " <p> " I 'm Sharee , " Sharee said . <p> " It 's for her , " Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward a little , to get the receptionist to look at her instead of at her mother . " I made the appointments for her . She saw Dr. Rourke . " <p> The receptionist looked from one to the other . After a while she said , " Which one of you is pregnant ? " <p> " Her , " Delaware said , holding Sharee 's hand . <p> " Me , " Sharee said , holding Delaware 's hand . <p> " Then she 's Sharee Aske ? Who are you ? " <p> " Delaware Aske . " <p> After a moment of silence the receptionist , whose name tag said she was Kathryn , accepted that , and turned to Sharee . " O.K. , now there 's one more form to sign , " she said with professional firmness , " and you for sure did n't eat anything this morning , did you ? " Sharee responded at once to the institutional tone . " No , " she said , shaking her head . " And I can sign the form to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptionist 's sudden , understanding glance at her . It was her turn to be mad . " How come you let those people yell at us out there ? " she asked in an abrupt , trembling voice . <p> " There is n't anything we can do , " the receptionist said . " They ca n't come onto the property . The sidewalk 's free , you know . " Her voice was cool . <p> " I thought there were escorts . " <p> " The volunteers usually come Tuesdays , that 's the regular day . Dr. Rourke put you in today because he 's going on vacation . Right there , see , honey ? " She showed Sharee where to sign . <p> " Are they going to be there when we go out ? " <p> " Where 's your car ? " <p> " We came on the bus . " <p> Kathryn frowned . After a pause she said , " You ought to have a taxi going home . " <p> Delaware had no idea what it cost to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably had around ten dollars in her bag . Maybe they could ride the taxi part way . She said nothing . <p> " You can call it from here . Tell it to come to the back entrance , the doctors ' parking lot . O.K. , that 's it . If you 'll just sit down over there , Nurse will be with you in a minute . " Kathryn gathered up the papers and went into some inner office . <p> " Come on , " Delaware said , and went over to the sofa , two chairs , table-with-magazines arrangement . Sharee did not follow her for a while , but stood at the reception desk , looking around . Delaware still felt angry . " Come on ! " she said . <p> Sharee came over , sat down on the sofa , and looked around from there . She had dressed for the occasion in her new jeans skirt , white cowboy boots , and blue satin cowboy jacket . Debi at the Head Shop had given her a wet-look curl in Daffodil Gold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but this morning it looked good , like a lion 's golden mane , wild and full . Fear and excitement made her dark eyes shine . Looking at her , Delaware felt strange and sad . She picked up a magazine and stared at it . <p> It was a kind of pretty place . The sofa and chairs were aqua , her favorite color . Delaware was staring at a magazine and looking mad . Sometimes Delaware acted like she knew everything . She knew a lot but she was n't the mama , she was n't a mama at all . That was a thing she did n't know . And Sharee did know . She remembered all of it , how she stuck out in front like a piano and had to pee all the time , and how her own mama had been so mad . Mama was always mad . It was a lot easier ever since she went to Alaska with David , it was a lot easier without her , just Sharee and Delaware in the apartment , like it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . That deep , deep softness and so small , like everything good in the world there where you could hold it and hug onto it and the milk came and it felt so good you did n't know if you were the baby or the baby was you . Delaware did n't remember that . But she did . <p> This time she had known right away , next morning . With Delaware she had n't known because she was n't thinking about babies then , she was n't a mama , she was just thinking all the time about Donny and loving him . Then when she started sticking out in front and her mama asked her about her periods , she and Donny had broken up and she was going with Roddy . And then her mama had got so mad and she had to stop going with Roddy or anybody . But this time , this was different . This time she was mad herself . She and Donny had been in love . But this was different . What Mac did , in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo monkey , and then made her watch the rest of the movie . When he finally brought her home she took a long shower , and in the shower she thought , something 's happening . Next morning , she thought , something 's happening . And then in two days when her period had n't started she knew . She knew it would n't . And she was really mad . People thought she never got mad , but she did . It was like it started right there in her stomach , the same place , and spread out around her like a ball of hot red light . She did n't say , but she knew . She did n't know everything but she knew what was hers . What was inside her was hers . Mac had bent her arm and covered her mouth and stuck his thing into her just like some zoo monkey , but what happened inside her was hers , and she made it happen or not happen . Delaware had happened because she was hers , her own , she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of her like a wart , like a scab you pick off . Like Mac had hurt her , cut her , made this wound inside her . There was a scab over the wound , and she was going to get it off and be whole . She was n't some zoo monkey or some kind of wound , she was the person she was . That was what Linda always said when she was in the special class . Be the person you are , Sharee . You are a whole person , a lovely person . And you have a lovely daughter . Are n't you proud of her ? You 're a good mother , Sharee . I know , Sharee always said to Linda , and she said it in her head now . Sometimes Delaware thought she was the mama , but she was n't . Sharee was . As soon as she said she wanted abortion , Delaware got mad-looking and bossy and kept saying are you sure , are you sure , and Sharee could n't explain to her why she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . Sometimes I think I am , Delaware said . Sharee knew what she meant . But that was n't the kind of mama she meant . See , you were me until you were you , she told Delaware . I did you . I made you be . But this one is n't like that . It is n't me , it 's just like this wrong piece of me I do n't want , like a hangnail . Jeez , Mama ! Delaware said , and Sharee told her do n't swear . Anyway , Delaware knew she knew what she was doing , and stopped asking are you sure , are you sure , and got the appointment with Dr. Rourke . Now she was sitting on the aqua sofa looking sad again . Sharee took her hand . " You are my Knight in Shining Armor , " she said . Delaware looked really surprised and then said , " Oh , jeez , Mama , " but not mad . " Do n't swear , " Sharee said . <p> A nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses ' ugly pale green slacks and smock . She looked at them both and smiled . " Hi ! " she said . <p> " Hi ! " Sharee said , and smiled . <p> The nurse looked at the papers in her hand . " O.K. , just checking , " she said . " You 're Sharee , " she said to Delaware . " How old are you , Sharee ? " <p> " Thirty-one , " Sharee said . <p> " Right . And how old are you , honey ? " <p> " I just came here with her , " Delaware said . <p> " Yeah , " the nurse said , looking confused . She stared at the papers and then at Delaware . " Then it is n't you that 's here for the procedure ? " Delaware shook her head . <p> " But we need to know your age . " <p> " What for ? " <p> The nurse went official . " Are you a minor ? " <p> " Yes , " Delaware said , nasty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sharee picked up a magazine with Kevin Costner on the cover . " That man looks mad , " she said , studying the photograph . " There 's a man comes into the Frosty that looks mad like that all the time . He 's really cute , though . He always gets the burger no fries and a strawberry softie . I do n't like softies . They do n't taste like anything . I like the hard ice cream . The old fashion . Old fashion hard ice cream . That 's what you like too , is n't it ? " <p> Delaware nodded , and then said " Yes , " because Sharee needed you to say things . She had found that she wanted to cry , that is , that she was ready to cry but did n't want to . The cause was the place on her shoulder where the man 's sign had hit her . She wanted to cry because it hurt . She was n't hurt . There was no mark on her jeans-jacket . There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd see tonight when she undressed , or maybe nothing . But the place where the wooden edge of the sign had hit felt separately alive and hurtful . It made her heart cold and her throat swollen . She took deep breaths . The nurse came back . <p> " O.K. , honey ! " she said to the air between Sharee and Delaware . <p> Sharee jumped right up , her turn to dance . She got hold of Delaware 's hand and tugged her up . " Come on ! " she said , looking excited and pretty . <p> Norman had no right to just walk off like that . He was rude and selfish . His sign had not hit the girl in the shoulder , but if it had , if it had happened to , it could quite well have gotten both of them into trouble again . He had absolutely no right to do that . Swinging the sign around that way . He could have hit her . He had no right . He never obeyed orders . She would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was past nine and no one else would be coming . She looked down the block , but there was no one on foot , and none of the cars that came by slowed down . The terrible woman in her boots and a satin jacket like some circus performer , dragging the girl , her own daughter , you could see how alike they looked . That poor girl , she should pray for her . Only she was so angry , it was hard to pray . She could pray for the baby . And the father . Some poor boy , maybe a service man , a soldier , and no doubt he did n't even know , what did they care about his rights , nothing . Nothing but self , self , self . They had no right . They were animals . <p> Her throat was sore and her hands were trembling again . She hated it when her hands trembled . They said soldiers were afraid on the battlefield . But the trembling made her feel that she was like Grandpa Kevory sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , white hands trembling and shaking , you 'll have to help me hold that cup , Mary , and then his head would jerk , on purpose , and the water would run down his chin and he would shake Mary with his horrible shaking hands . No one would come . <p> They had no right to expect her to stand here alone . Norman was supposed to be here . He had volunteered . She had only come because she had missed last Tuesday because she had to substitute for the secretary at the school and always made up for time she missed . She had promised Mr. Young . Promises were important to her . No one else really cared . They came when they felt like it and never thought a thing about not being there if it was the least bit inconvenient . He had no right to walk off like that , leaving her alone without a sign or anything , thinking of nothing but himself . She had thought that maybe Mr. Young would happen to drive by and see her standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no cars coming down the street . No one was coming . No one would come . <p> I am a soldier , she thought , and as always the thought moved through her making her strong . The brave boys were there defending the flag : she saw the flag waving bright and clean over clouds of oily blackness . She would ask Mr. Young if she could carry an American flag when she was on duty . American flags were on sale now at the mall , with yellow bows . I am a soldier of life . I am on guard . She stood straight and walked up and down the sidewalk in front of the clinic , turning on her heel at the end of the lawn . She was glad and proud to be a soldier . <p> Going down the hall Delaware said to the nurse , " Can I come in ? " But she had blown it not saying how old she was . The nurse walked right on and said , " Ask Doctor , " in an eat-shit voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for Nurse , ask Doctor ? <p> Dr. Rourke greeted her , " Hi , Della . " Pretty close . She asked him if she could stay with Sharee and he explained that they 'd found it better not to let relatives or significant others stay with the patient during the procedure . Sharee let go her hand with a big smile . She liked Dr. Rourke , a handsome , ruddy redhead , and had told Delaware several times that she thought he was cute . She followed the nurse eagerly through a swinging door . Dr. Rourke stayed in the hall with Delaware . " She 'll be fine , " he said . Delaware nodded . " Aspiration is about as big a deal as a haircut , " he said in his pleasant voice . He waited for her to nod , and then said , " You know , I can do that tubal ligation . It 's not a big deal , she wo n't know the difference . " <p> " That 's the trouble , " Delaware said . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Delaware said . <p> " I can explain the ligation to her . So that she 'll understand that she wo n't have to worry about prevention any more . " He was warm , urgent with generosity . <p> " Can you untie it ? " <p> " She should n't be having , " then a pause . <p> " She was brain damaged during birth , " Delaware said . She had said it fairly often . " It is n't genetic . " Living proof , she stared at the doctor . He began to look angry , like Kevin Costner , like everybody . <p> " Yes , all right , " he said , doctors never make mistakes . " But is n't it pretty likely that she 'll forget to use the diaphragm again ? " <p> " She did n't . She does n't forget . This jerk she knows took her to a drive-in and came on her in the car . So like she does n't want some date-rapist 's side effects . " She stared at the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " Maybe like someday she 'd want to have another baby . I ca n't choose that for her . How could I do that ? " <p> He took a deep breath and let it out heavily . <p> " All right , " he said . He turned away . " She 'll be fine , " he said again . " Piece of cake . " He went through the swinging doors . <p> Delaware stood a while in the hall and then thought it was stupid to wait there . She went to ask the receptionist where the bathroom was . She had begun to need to pee while they were on the bus , even before they changed to the westside bus at Sixth . <p> Norman waited till he was sure Squealy Mary would be gone , but when he came back she was prissing up and down in front of the Butcher Shop as if she owned the place , straight-backed , turning around at each end of the lawn like some wind-up toy . What did her husband think he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They were all the same , showing their wares , prissing on their stick legs . Sucking up to Young . Oh , Mr. Young says this , Mr. Young says that . He knew what Young said . Though I speak with tongues of men and angels . He knew what Young said and he knew his own business . None of their business . They ought to be home , keeping house and keeping out of the way . He started to turn back , to go around the next block hoping she would be gone when he came back to the corner . When he realized what he was doing , he stopped short . He strode down the block straight to her . " All right , " he said , " I 'll take over now . " <p> " I 'm on duty , " she said in her high , shaking voice . <p> " I said I 'm taking over , " he said , and watched her head bobble and tremble . But she did not move . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she squealed . <p> " I stand here , " he said . <p> " All right , stand there , " she said , and she started parading up and down again . He stood holding up his sign . Again and again she came past him , from the left , then from the right , heels clicking on the pavement , hands by her sides , shoulders held narrowed in . Shove the stick of his sign up into her , keep her back straight ! He never looked at her . He stood at his post in front of the steps of the Butcher Shop and held up his sign . God was his witness . <p> Sitting in the very clean green stall Delaware decided to cry , to get the tears and snot out in private while her mother was busy elsewhere , but of course they would n't come ; she just made her throat feel sore . She unbuttoned her shirt and slipped it down to look at her right shoulder , between the neck and the shoulder cap , where she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . Nothing showed except some redness that was probably because she 'd kept rubbing it with the hand Sharee was n't holding . <p> Back on the sofa in the waiting room she picked up the magazine to hide behind . She read some words about something , but saw with great clarity all the time the legs and feet of the woman who had shouted about praying . She was wearing tan pantyhose and navy shoes with trim little heels . Her skirt was navy and white , white dots on navy , with pleats . Above that Delaware could not see her . She could only hear the screaming , Mom , Mom . The man was wearing slacks , brown slacks and brown shoes , and a striped shirt . He had a saggy belly because he was old , but he had no face , because he was shaking the possum sign in front of it with that chopping motion , as if it was an ax , first up and down , then closer and closer to Sharee and Delaware , as they came closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Delaware is a pretty name , " Kathryn said behind the reception desk , and after a while the words came across to Delaware . " Where did you get that name ? " <p> " My mother just liked how it sounded . " <p> " It 's unusual . " <p> " There 's Indiana Jones . " <p> Kathryn laughed and nodded . She sorted papers in a file . " Just you and her live together ? " <p> Delaware did n't mind , because Kathryn 's voice was easy , or because her sugar-brown face looked tired now that it did n't look angry . " Yeah , " she said . <p> " You in high school ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Job ? " <p> " Summers . She works at the Frost-T-Man . She always works . " <p> " That 's good , " Kathryn said softly . She sorted some more and after a while said , " You doing O.K. in high school , " not a question but as if she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . Go on to college ? " <p> " Yeah I guess . " <p> " That 's good , " Kathryn said again . " You 'll do it . " <p> The tears arrived suddenly and quietly and poured out and dried up . Delaware read reviews of a movie about a man who killed twenty women and a movie about children possessed by demons . The nurse came to the end of the hall and said , " Your friend 's in recovery now , honey . " <p> Delaware followed her down the hall . The nurse talked to her without turning around . " She was a little nervous so Doctor gave her a tranquilizer . She 'll be a little woozy for half an hour , maybe . Then she can get dressed . " She led Delaware into a clean , green , windowless room with three beds in it , two of them empty . Sharee was tucked into one , her curly , thick hair pulled back and her face without makeup , so that she looked like a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi , baby ! " she said . <p> Ursula K.
