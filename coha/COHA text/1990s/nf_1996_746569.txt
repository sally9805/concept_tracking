QUESTION , Professor King : I have one or two questions before we start the program . John , you mentioned various factors that were important in terms of employee motivation . You mentioned permanent employment . You mentioned the bonus , the participation in profit . If you had to select out of this group of factors , which do you think is the most important , in terms of Lincoln 's working experience in motivating people to do as well as they have for Lincoln or with Lincoln ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : I do not think any one factor is that much more important than another . To explain it a little bit further , we have the 19th century concept of piecework . In other words , we pay only for good parts and good products . The workers can earn as much as they decide they want to earn within that capability of time . They can substantially increase their earnings by coming in a half hour early . Some work through their lunch hours and eat while they are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they earn the more the company earns . <p> The people are also rated twice a year on four factors . One is the quantity of their output . Equally important is the quality of the output because the QA department rates each worker . Then we consider how they cooperate ; how many new ideas they come forth with , and how dependable they are . That it is a competitive basis . We rate strictly on the curve , just like every law school does . Someone gets over a hundred and someone gets under a hundred . It is a very competitive atmosphere . At the same time , twenty-five percent of that rating is based upon teamwork and cooperation . <p> I do not think there is any one factor that does it . It is a combination . When they know that they can control their piecework earnings ; that they can control their rating ; if everyone works together and we truly satisfy the customers , the bonus pool becomes bigger , and , therefore , the total income rises . <p> QUESTION , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the stock funds the market goes up and down . I have had some experience with the market , and I was wondering where the employees get into this venture capital ? Are they fully aware of the risks , or have you had some bad experiences ? Has it all gone up ? Is it money that they would count on , or are you on the stairway to the stars ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. McDermott : Other than the information in the background notes provided and the reference I made in my remarks to some criticisms of low returns , I have no specific details with me on how individual funds have performed . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Powers : Mr. Hastings , does your company ever terminate people for misconduct and , if so , are there any differences if someone is terminated ? Are they losing a lifetime of work rather than just work itself ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : That is a good point . Our guaranteed employment does not cover misconduct . Nor does it cover work performance . If someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon economic conditions that would affect the total corporation rather than individual performance . Individuals still have to perform . They are not there to do things that are not acceptable in the workplace . <p> QUESTION , Mr. McKennirey : Mike , there has been an issue in the United States regarding employee participation schemes and the formation of company and in-house unions under the structure of the NLRA . Could you comment on the difference between Canada and the United States in that respect ? <p> QUESTION , Mr. McDermott : Is this the Electromation situation ? <p> COMMENT , Mr. McKennirey : Yes . <p> ANSWER , Mr. McDermott : Well , we do not have that situation . We do not have the Electromation situation under our laws . And there is a very interesting , relatively recent decision by the Canada Labour Relations Board . It is one in which the company initiated some kind of a committee or program that it was going to set up . The union was not consulted on that occasion . There was a complaint to the labour board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look , in a unionized setting , you should involve the union . But the union then can not simply say " no " and stop anything from happening . They have a responsibility to respond . If they do not , and have no good reason for doing so , then the company can go ahead . It is a very succinct decision , however , it is quite distinct from the Electromation situation . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Halpern : Mr. Hastings , first I want to congratulate you . I think Lincoln has done an outstanding job as a model for many companies . But I do have a few short questions . One , are you currently unionized or have you ever been challenged in terms of having a union ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : We have no union in the United States or Canada . We are unionized in Mexico , Spain , and France . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Halpern : Two , with respect to quality , I have read or heard that in the manufacturing area , if an employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair it on his own time . Is that correct ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : That is correct . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Halpern : Do you still use that system today ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : Yes . By the way , if other employees felt that it was out of that person 's control , teams of people often come and repair parts to help out the individual . They do get a communal family relationship many times . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Halpern : Thirdly , how do you provide incentives to your non-manufacturing and non-sales personnel ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : Let us take engineers in R &; D. It is very difficult , of course , to measure how good they are in any given rating period because if they are working , particularly in research , they probably work for years and do not produce anything . Then they come up with something marvelous . It is quite judgmental . It is still on a rating basis . The individual knows that the more he puts into his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a make-work thing . The supervisors are hands-on people who are , generally , working with the engineering group so that they know what is going on and whether there is progress being made on anything . However , it is a very judgmental thing . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Langmack : Don , in my case , we had a company about twenty-five years ago . We were doing fairly well as far as the company was concerned . But we realized that we could improve . We said to the employees , if this incentive is going to work for you , it is going to work for us . So we instituted a profit-sharing plan where we took ten percent of our profit and paid the employees . Well , the union said , no , you can not do that . We did it for three years until the employees had a nice nest egg . The employees then went to the union , which is a tough union , and said we want this profit sharing . But the union said we should just pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Am I old hat ? This was about twenty-five years ago . Are the international unions accepting profit-sharing plans ? <p> QUESTION , Mr. Hastings : You mean in the United States ? <p> COMMENT , Mr. Langmack : Yes . <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : I think it has changed drastically in that period of time . <p> COMMENT , Mr. Langmack : Yes , it has . <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : We open our shop once a month and let anybody come in and talk about the incentive system . It is about a five-hour tour around the explanation and details of the program . We have had lots of labor unions come in , along with some of the management and human resource departments trying to find ways to work together . We now have profit sharing in the automotive companies . I think it is going to continue ; I think it is going to expand . <p> I think that with this crazy corporate downsizing that is going on right now , there is going to be a backlash against companies worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government regulations , but I think there is going to be a backlash against corporations themselves . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Langmack : But are the international unions accepting and are they encouraging the profit-sharing plan ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : Remember when General Motors was shutting down twenty-one plants ? They were going to shut them down a few years ago . We were buying their Delco motor manufacturing plant in Dayton . Dayton is , of course , very unionized . That is where GM recently had their troubles . GM said , if you buy this plant you are going to have to buy the union , too . We have an agreement that we will not sell it to anyone that did not accept the unionization of employees . <p> We decided to go ahead and do this , even though Dayton is not very far from Cleveland . The international union vice president came in from Washington to attend one of our first meetings . He had no problem with profit sharing ; he had no problem with piecework ; he had no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through the bargaining unit . His concern was that he wanted members . <p> I believe if unions in the United States are going to stop the continuous aggravation of their membership , they are going to have to accept profit sharing . They are going to have to accept the incentives and let the employees have more empowerment . And I think that there is a trend in that direction with the unions here . <p> COMMENT , Mr. McDermott : I think that there are a number of Canadian unions , including international unions , that have accepted gain sharing as part of the package . And there are some that still formally reject it . But the difference for the unionized sector is that they see it as one element . Unions like the Canadian Communications Energy and Paper Workers , for example , or the Steelworkers , have adopted policies where they say fine , we will take part in these kinds of programs . But , we also want to have some say in the direction the company is taking . So it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme as well . <p> QUESTION , Mr. Barrett : Mr. Hastings , you described employment for life . You also mentioned the performance ratings . People are graded on a curve , a competitive situation . In terms of the fact that you fire people for cause when they are not producing quality materials , are you routinely firing a significant number of people at the bottom who just are unacceptable , or is it the exception ? Are there people who just do not cut it  --  is it the exception rather than the rule . Is there a significant turnover at the bottom ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : That is a very good question . During the first 90 to 120 days , we have experienced in the last couple of years almost fifty percent turnover of the new hires . I think we are one of the few larger manufacturing companies in Northeast Ohio that has been hiring a lot of factory workers in the last couple of years . This is considerably higher than we have experienced in the past . Normally our attrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around twenty-three percent , then it jumps . Of course , we are finding that the problem is associated with what we call Generation X , who do not feel they really want to get involved in the factory as much as their parents or grandparents did . <p> One of the things that we found is that when they come in through high school , they are into higher education . We are not getting the achievers into the factory elements . We have really had to work at that . We are actually going into the junior high schools and are trying to get the thinking started . <p> I met with Mayor White yesterday morning . His father was a machinist at Chase Brass . He is going to be talking  --  when he is talking about education  --  about the dignity of factory labor . Many of the innercity people need to get good jobs like that . <p> The attrition rate is high at the beginning . Once they get past that initial phase and into the flow of it , our attrition rate is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What do we do with those who get low ratings ? If anyone gets a seventy-five or below , we have a committee of superintendents who work with that person to develop a plan to try to improve him . We do not try to cut him out . Once we feel that he is an employee that we have spent some time training , we do everything we possibly can to upgrade his performance so that he can start getting into the higher ratings . If it continues over a long period of time , then he , generally , by peer pressure , will leave on his own volition . We do not fire that many employees . <p> QUESTION , Mr. O'Grady : I am interested in this idea of whether there should be some legislative impediments to massive layoffs . I listened to Secretary Reich who said he felt that the government had to go along with the theory that the flexibility is unavoidable . But the government wanted to soften the blow by making pensions and health insurance affordable . It seems that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not justified in economic terms . Some may even result from conflicts in interest whereby executives , with stock options or stocks , want to drive up the market price on Wall Street . It seems to me there is going to be some pressure to think in terms of things like legislative severance packages , legislative pension packages , legislative contribution to the Social Security costs and so forth . I wonder what the speakers think . <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : I think that is a real possibility . If the American public does react negatively to this , legislation and some of these ideas could come forth . I am not in favor of them because one of the great advantages in America is the free enterprise system . I think we have to come forth and appreciate and teach corporate responsibility . What these corporations are doing is completely irresponsible . It is not in the best interest of American competitiveness . <p> COMMENT , Mr. McDermott : The Canadian experience , generally , is legislation governing notice of group terminations rather than acting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly lengthy notices for group terminations . But the purpose is to try to negotiate some type of adjustment plan . <p> However , in terms of severance , that is taken care of in the world of collective bargaining . Given that the incidence of collective bargaining is that much higher in Canada , it takes some of the pressure off the legislative body for additional legislation . <p> QUESTION , Professor King . I have one other question for Don . On profit sharing , do you ever get into arguments with the workers as to how you calculate profits ? <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : You bet . Is that enough of an answer ? <p> COMMENT , Professor King . Well , I do not mind throwing a hook once in a while . <p> ANSWER , Mr. Hastings : There are two separate issues . One is that there can be disagreement as to the rating . And we have a refined process where the individual ratings are looked at right on up the ladder . In fact , anyone who gets a seventy-five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets over 110 has to have an individually written letter which is looked at by corporate officers . We are trying to make absolutely sure that there is no favoritism or prejudice against someone who gets into the rating system . We try to maintain it as accurately and fairly as we possibly can . <p> We have an open-door policy . Anyone can challenge the rating . They can come in and see their supervisor . If they are not satisfied there , they can come into my office . <p> We had some issues arise this year because we paid a record dollar amount in bonuses . We paid approximately $64 million to 3,400 people . The actual average was $19,900 . However , we had more people this year because we have been hiring . Consequently , the average last year , with a lower dollar payout , was $18,900 . <p> There was a drop in the amount an individual employee received , even though the company paid a record dollar amount , That caused some fear for a few weeks . We got a couple articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent nineteen hours with employees in group meetings during a two-week period going through exactly what had happened , why it happened , and making sure that there was a communing effect . There was a threat that an employee was going to bring in the UAW , but only nineteen people showed up out of 3,400 . We have not had any more difficulties since . <p>
