Was it only last winter when journalists were moping about their respective newsrooms muttering , " Is n't anything going on ? " These days the greenroom of CNN 's Washington bureau looks and sounds a lot like a big-city emergency room on a wild Saturday night . <P> Get the lawyers out of here ! I want the terrorism experts ! <P> Are you nuts ? With Bonnie bearing down on the coast ? We need the meteorologists ! <P> With the ruble collapsing ? Yeltsin tottering ? Clinton in Moscow ? I 've got six international economists and Kremlin watchers in makeup ! <P> Hold it ! Hold it ! McGwire and Sosa both went yard ! I need a pretentious sports essayist stat ! <P> This onslaught of news is not mere coincidence . It is , in fact , a rarely understood law of nature  --  a kind of Harmonic Convergence . Every once in a great while , the emergence of an important news event generates so much energy that it actually produces more news , much as the appearance of a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five other buses immediately behind it . <P> I first spotted this kind of convergence in the fall of 1964 . On Oct. 7 , in the midst of a presidential campaign , a top White House aide was arrested in a YMCA men 's room and charged with indecent exposure . Nine days later  --  one day after the St. Louis Cardinals won a seven-game World Series against the New York Yankees and the Soviets ousted Khrushchev and replaced him with Brezhnev  --  China exploded its first atomic device . That same day , Harold Wilson became Britain 's first Labour Prime Minister in 13 years . That week TIME put four people on its cover . <P> Ask a member of my generation for the most dramatic example of Harmonic Convergence , and the answer is sure to be , 1968 , of course . I 've got a different candidate : the fall of 1973 . <P> Watergate was still dominating the headlines when , on Oct. 6 , Egypt and Syria launched an attack on Israel during the Yom Kippur holidays . Four days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 days , Middle East and Persian Gulf nations organized a total oil embargo against the U.S. because of its support for Israel . And on Oct. 20 , one day before the embargo took full effect , came the Saturday Night Massacre . Nixon ordered special prosecutor Archibald Cox fired , Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned in protest , and an honest-to-God constitutional crisis was born . <P> What makes that 1973 convergence so remarkable is that it was not just a Harmonic Convergence but an Inter-Related Convergence as well . The firing of Cox made impeachment a real possibility , but so did the removal of Agnew , often seen as Nixon 's best impeachment insurance . And so did the oil embargo : by delivering a hammerblow to the American economy in the form of higher energy prices , the embargo further undermined Nixon 's popularity . <P> So what about the summer of ' 98 ? Well , if the Clinton-Yeltsin summit and the fear of economic collapse lead both McGwire and Sosa to keep hitting home runs in search of enhanced income possibilities , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
