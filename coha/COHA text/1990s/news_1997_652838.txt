<p> AN IDEAL HOLLYWOOD ENDING IT WAS NOT . How gratifying it might have been if David Helfgott had proved the resurrected pianistic genius , however eccentric , portrayed in the movie " Shine " and in the surrounding promotional apparatus . Then again , " Shine , " produced in Australia , was not , strictly speaking , a Hollywood movie . <p> So what exactly happened ? Is it possible at last , with Mr. Helfgott headed for Europe after two recitals this week in Pasadena , Calif. , to cast a dispassionate eye on the affair of the last few months for what it may have to say about the worrisome state of classical music in the United States ? <p> What became obvious on the pianist 's arrival in America last month was that the Helfgott phenomenon had little to do with music . Suspicions raised in advance by the waywardness of his performances on the film soundtrack and in an RCA recording of Rachmaninoff 's Third Piano Concerto ( known to musicians , and now to moviegoers , as the Rach 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall and another in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia : whatever level Mr. Helfgott had achieved before his mental breakdown , this was not now a great , or even a particularly good , pianist . If the medium for his " genius " had been chess or mathematics , his shortcomings would probably have become more quickly and indisputably apparent to more people . <p> Nor , despite the heated terms in which it was argued , did the phenomenon have much to do with morality . There was , to be sure , a voyeuristic aspect to the intense curiosity surrounding the concerts as well as the movie ; Mr. Helfgott 's mental illness , especially as portrayed by Geoffrey Rush in the film , manifests itself in undeniably entertaining ways . But far more , there was a genuine desire to see an underdog triumph , Rocky-like , and to find once again , in the best Hollywood tradition , that love conquers all . Mr. Helfgott seemed to be enjoying his new-found fame and commercial success . If he was a victim of exploitation , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigies who are trotted onto the concert stage with such regularity ? <p> No , the Helfgott phenomenon had mostly to do with show business . That Jenny Lind , the " Swedish Nightingale , " was actually a great singer probably mattered little to P. T. Barnum , who sold her to a ravenous American public a century ago ; what mattered was that she was marketable . Barnum would have been the first to recognize the opportunity afforded by the success of " Shine , " but he could hardly have done a better job of capitalizing on it than that done by his Australian counterparts . <p> And this , alas , is what the classical-music business has come to in America and elsewhere : chasing sensations , whether David Helfgott , Gregorian chant or aging tenors . It is a world full of institutions grown unwieldy , a world that has lost faith in itself and therefore looks for salvation in celebrity . Although the rumors of its demise have been greatly exaggerated , the classical world persists in taking suicidal risks in search of the quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one might add , in the cases of companies and individuals trying to make a hefty profit from a business in which prestige was once as good as gold : radio stations , record companies and artist managements , not to mention the big-name artists themselves . <p> Classical radio in this country is by now an old , sad story . Of the few stations that have survived the carnage of recent decades , most have abandoned any serious commitment to the repertory , allying themselves with syndicates that offer mindless packages of juicy , ear-tickling tidbits . With rare exceptions , a Mahler symphony , an opera or even a serious song is not to be heard . <p> Now many of the big classical record labels seem bent on traveling a similar route . Having belatedly awakened to the existence of a reissue glut of their own making , they have in many cases simply jettisoned loyal artists and substantial repertory and turned to more profitable " thematic " compilations , movie soundtracks and dubious crossover efforts . But while they may have abandoned their ideals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ready-made celebrity , like Mr. Helfgott , or the next fluky hit , like Henryk Gorecki 's mystical Third Symphony . <p> Here are real tragedies for an art seeking new audience members . Much is made , and rightly , of the disappearance of music from school curriculums . But at least as important as early force-feeding of music to youngsters is easy and inexpensive access for those who may discover it at a later stage of life . Through much of the century , that access has come from the varied fare available on radio and records . <p> Perhaps the biggest problem of all , however , if one is to believe the English critic Norman Lebrecht , is simple greed . Mr. Lebrecht 's latest book , " When the Music Stops : Managers , Maestros and the Corporate Murder of Classical Music , " available in Britain and soon to appear in America , offers a scathing indictment of celebrity artists and their managers , although his good points tend to be undercut by a casual attitude toward factual detail . <p> AND HERE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  David Helfgott . He provided , if little else , the catharsis and diversion of righteous indignation . Everyone in the business , it seemed , was preoccupied , wanting to know where everyone else stood , feeling superior to most . <p> " What should I say to my students , who have been told that the way to get ahead in this field is through diligence , hard work and patience ? " a conservatory professor asked . Tell them that life is unfair , perhaps . ( Although Mr. Helfgott has some tales to tell along those lines , too . ) <p> Critics could decry the exploitation of this disturbed individual and the lack of sophistication of audiences of which they were ashamed to be a part . Helfgott spokespeople and audience members could heap scorn on the critics , who were , after all , always intent on spoiling a good thing . ( " Mean-spirited " was the term heard most often in the aisles of Avery Fisher Hall . ) Helfgott " publicists " went a step farther , doing their best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts were not written about in certain quarters . <p> Even The Times of London got into the act . " The critics ' attacks probably reflected an irritation that the musical agenda has been set by a non-American film , " wrote Quentin Letts , a New York correspondent . ( That 's it , of course : American critics would have preferred a musical agenda set by " Mr. Holland 's Opus , " with its soupy popification of classical music . ) <p> " Given some of the discordant drivel their fraternity has endorsed , " Mr. Letts went on , " it is hard to resist a frisson of satisfaction at seeing their game spoilt . " <p> The Helfgott hype included facile and absurd comparisons . Vladimir Horowitz , it was noted , retired from the stage from 1953 to 1965 because of nervous strain ; and in fact , Horowitz played wretchedly at times in the 1980 's while under heavy medication . Glenn Gould , it was noted , was also eccentric , and he groaned along with his performances more or less the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more seriously disturbed than has widely been thought , to judge from a book due next month , " Glenn Gould : The Ecstasy and Tragedy of Genius , " by Peter F. Ostwald , who was a psychiatrist and a friend of Gould 's . <p> But such comparisons overlook an obvious difference : both Horowitz and Gould established themselves as brilliant performers in maturity . For all the loose talk of " prodigy " and " genius , " Mr. Helfgott was nothing more than a promising student at the Royal College of Music in London before his first breakdown . Afterward , there was little reason to expect greatness of him . <p> A more accurate analogy might be to Erwin Nyiregyhazi , a pianist born in Budapest in 1903 . Nyiregyhazi ( pronounced NEAR-edge-hah-zee ) failed to realize his prodigious youthful potential and fell into poverty in Los Angeles , where he died in 1987 . Some " comeback " recordings he made in the 70 's , however , reveal a genuinely developed and reasonably coherent artistic temperament , something the 49-year-old Mr. Helfgott has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these , the pianist who kept coming to mind in the way Mr. Helfgott skated over musical surfaces , and especially in the kind of breathless adulation he drew from uncritical listeners , was , of all people , Liberace . Mr. Helfgott may have found his proper level on the Academy Awards telecast . Even though he got lost in his signature piece , " The Flight of the Bumblebee , " he came off sounding better than Madonna . <p> Rejoice , the music world is told . Think of all the potential new listeners who are being reached by the film , the concerts , the recordings . ( " Brilliantissimo , " a disk of solo performances by Mr. Helfgott , is due next month from RCA . ) It is indeed possible that a Helfgott experience will provide a first , intriguing exposure to classical music for some listeners . As those of us who came to music late can attest , you have to start somewhere . But it would be hopelessly unrealistic to expect great throngs of new listeners to arise from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music stops looking for great throngs in any case ? Its problems did not arise overnight , and they will not be solved overnight . In fact , much of what is happening among musical institutions , self-destructive urges aside , may be part of a long-term evolution : a normalization of sorts after the booming growth of recent decades , a retrenchment that may not be altogether unhealthy . <p> For the attempt to make classical music a mass medium has essentially failed . The turnout for the likes of David Helfgott and the Three Tenors has little effect on the day-to-day operations of musical institutions beyond encouraging them to chase chimeras . Making classical music available to everyone is one thing ; trying to create an endlessly expanding market for it is another . <p> True , the attempt at popularization was made largely out of noble motives . Four decades ago , most musicians in this country genuinely had it bad . Orchestral players were browbeaten by conductors , grossly underpaid in relation to other highly skilled professions and rarely employed year-round . Spurred by toughening unions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons and instituting summer festivals , chamber programs and other events to provide fuller and more lucrative employment . Old institutions were puffed up and new ones created . <p> Orchestral players were given big wage increases and other benefits , to bring them into line with comparable professions . But human nature being what it is , this catch-up mode soon came to be seen by its beneficiaries as the norm . For the players , leapfrogging ahead of their peers from one contract to the next became an end in itself . Although most now have it good in relation to the general population , they have been slow to acknowledge that such increases can not go on forever  --  indeed , for very long at all . Their continuing demands , along with the high fees of music directors , put tremendous strain on the finances of even the largest orchestras . <p> Thus the pressure to fill every seat , and the ascendance of marketing . To most marketers , maximizing audiences means performing familiar , well loved repertory and hiring glitzy soloists and guest conductors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aberration that had little to do with hard-core musical activity were Mr. Helfgott not returning in August to play the Rach 3 with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra , an adjunct of the Los Angeles Philharmonic . The wonder in the current , panicked climate is that other orchestras have not ( yet ) leapt at him and his box-office power . <p> Glitzy soloists are hugely expensive , some able to draw more than $50,000 for a single performance . A few may be worth it , in terms of artistry as well as drawing power . Still , the returns are seldom more than marginal , and costs and ticket prices keep spiraling upward . <p> So the mandate to reach the masses with great music , which arose partly for good reasons , is kept in place chiefly for a bad one : to sustain an unstable economy . Classical music is saddled with oversize , overpriced institutions , and the only way it can keep them going , seemingly , is to feed the celebrity culture that has done it so much harm in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wisely , have begun to re-examine their missions and to take creative approaches to maintaining a solid audience base . Others may perish . Yet even there , some good is possible . If , for example , as seems likely , a regional orchestra were to die here and there , there might be a heightened demand for the great American orchestras to tour the United States rather than running off to play Beethoven in Japan year after year . There might  --  wonder of wonders  --  be a heightened demand for the great orchestras on radio and even on records . <p> It may be that we have seen the future , and it is the leaner and meaner past . Classical music thrived for centuries as a minority interest , loved passionately by a relative few . Unless the radio stations and record companies leave only scorched earth behind , it is likely to do so again .
