<p> Most Presidents run into unavoidable trouble by the time they reach midterm , but George Bush is different . Many of his troubles were not only avoidable but predictable , and this has hurt him because they raise questions about his judgment . <p> In a way , the criticism of his budget difficulties has been extreme if not unfair . Fights between Republicans and Democrats over how to raise and spend money are unavoidable . Put a few hundred billion on the table and they usually pounce on it like pit bulls . But the main thing is not that they disagreed about how to cut it up , but that they agreed to reduce the deficit by half a trillion dollars in the next five years . This may be the single most important economic decision of the last two years . <p> George Bush is better at the big things than the little things . His objective on the budget was admirable but his handling of it was comical , and when he 's mocked as weak or indecisive , he 's unpredictable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better qualities and followed John Sununu , Lee Atwater and James Baker down the low road . <p> After he won , he promised to nominate the best advisers available and told us we were living in an age of terror when life was fragile , and then picked Dan Quayle of Indiana for Vice President . This was clearly an avoidable blunder , and an injustice to both Mr. Quayle and the country , which fortunately can be corrected next time if his party thinks about it . <p> The odd thing about George Bush is that he plans his fumbles . He did n't have to promise not to raise taxes in a future he could not possibly foresee , or remind the country about his infamous wisecrack , by telling the reporters during the budget mess " read my hips . " They read his flips instead . <p> He has done some very good things . No President since the last great war has made a greater effort than George Bush to reach out to the opposition leaders for compromise and understanding . He has been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held more press conferences in more strange places than any President since the inception of that jumping-jack institution . He has many other good qualities , but foresight is n't one of them . <p> When he ordered 200,000 men into the Arabian desert , he went on vacation and delivered his war communiques from the back of a golf cart , and was genuinely surprised that most people did n't think this showed " grace under pressure . " In the middle of the budget crisis when he was trying to get the support of the leaders of the Democratic Party , he took time off to campaign in North Carolina for the re-election of Senator Jesse Helms , of all people . He was determined at the start to " hit the ground running , " forgetting that this is what John Kennedy did when he ran into the Bay of Pigs , and Lyndon Johnson did when he ran into Vietnam . <p> These are the " little things " that trouble even many of his most loyal supporters , and some of them are not so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade Mikhail Gorbachev not to use military force to achieve political objectives in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe , but he invaded Panama against his treaty commitments to the United Nations in order to capture a two-bit dictator , and did n't know what to do with him when he caught him . Having defied the U.N . in Panama , he then relied on it in Iraq . <p> It was n't enough for him to blockade Iraq and punish Saddam Hussein as " another Hitler , " but he insisted on sending the biggest U.S. Army since the last war into the desert , not wanting to use it , not knowing how to get it out and facing once more the taunts of the armchair warriors , who say he must not only restore the independence of Kuwait but also get rid of Saddam Hussein and the threat of Iraq 's Army as well . This is a dangerous situation for a President dropping in the popularity polls and facing both a deficit crisis and a mid-term election . <p> In such a pickle , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all bones and no skull , and ca n't sit still and think . He 's all over the lot - fighting for the rich , campaigning not only in North Carolina but in California , driving in from Camp David to conserve gas and letting his helicopter return empty , jogging in the morning and flying to the world series in Cincinnati at night , always on the move , always pleasant and even cheerful . <p> He is the first President in memory who has not been able to get the votes of a majority of the members of his own party for a major bill in the Congress , but he has even tolerated Newt Gingrich , the Republican whip in the House , who has not only defied the President on the budget but has n't even had the decency to resign . <p> He may come smiling through and even be re-elected , but it will take him a while to recover from the planned fumbles of the first half .
