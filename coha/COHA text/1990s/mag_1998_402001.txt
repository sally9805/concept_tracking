You name it-family feuds , bitter and twisted friends , psycho sisters-in-law whatever your dilemma , Cosmo helps you stay calm , cope , and conquer all ! By Miss Mingle // Everyone jokes about their lives being like a soap opera , but if your life were really a soap , here 's what your average afternoon would be like : You come home to discover your man is in bed with another woman . Or so you think , until the homewrecker rolls over and she 's not a woman but a man ! Your horror mounting , you realize it 's not just any man but your boss , whose only comment is " Are n't you supposed to be at the marketing meeting ? ' Okay , no one 's life is that out of control . But life can imitate art-no matter how cheesy the art is . Whether your 70-yearold dad announces he 's marrying his 20year-old secretary or your 17-year-old brother asks to borrow a dress , there are times you could swear you 've fallen into the plot of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do or say As the World takes these tumultuous Turns ? Emily Post has not prepared us to deal with today 's dilemmas . And it 's not advisable to find the answers in TVs daytime dramas ; blackmail , murder , and reconstructive surgery are not the best solutions to your social quandaries ( at least not as a rule ) . Well , stay tuned , All My Children , because there are antidotes for most of life 's melodramatic maladies , the crises that are bound to occur during the Days of Our Lives .... Q. My boyfriend left me for a man and now wants me to be a bridesmaid in his commitment ceremony . I do n't want to hurt him , but I 'll feel foolish if I go through with it-what should i do ? A. If you former boyfriend expects you to be his bridemaid , he really should be committed . If he 'd left you for a woman , would you happily lead his new love down the aisle ? Tell your overcivilized ex you 're pleased for him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might even quip , " I 'm afraid my bridesmaid days are over-especially when there is no bride ! " Q. I went through a wild stage in college and had lots of group sex . I 've now been monogamous for two years . Recently , my boyfriend introduced me to his business associate , who happens to be someone I once had sex with . I 'm not sure he remembers , so I do n't want to say anything . But if he tells my boyfriend , I 'll be mortifies . What should I do ? A. Potential mortification notwithstanding , there is only one course of action open to you : Keep your mouth shut . Chances are , the business associate wo n't say anything to your blissfully ignorant boyfriend , as proclaiming " I had sex with your girlfriend once , and boy is she wild ! " is not usually the best way to bond with a colleague . And unless the guy is hoping for a menage a trois , there is no reason for him to dredge up your past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck the business associate is clueless enough or perverse enough to kiss and tell ( you never know-he may even be hoping to rattle your boyfriend in order to gain some business advantage ) , I have three words : deny , deny , deny . When your boyfriend confronts you , tell him the man made a pass at you once , and you turned him down . Tell him the man did a lot of drugs in college and never knew who he was with . Tell him anything except the truth . Remember , it 's your boyfriend who will have to face this man on a regular basis , not you . And believe me , he does not want to know . So let sleeping ex-playmates lie . Q. My friend invited me sailing with her and her husband . When she went below , he pulled down his shorts and showed me his genitals . Shocked , I looked away . Now , I make excuses whenever she asks me to go sailiing . Should I tell her what he did ? A. If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably wo n't believe you or will assume it 's your fault . A woman with a philandering husband has to maintain a level of denial to stay in the relationship . You might attempt to discourage the lascivious landlubber by warning him in private that his sexual antics are not appreciated and he 'd better lay off . ( But be careful : A private conversation with this man may inspire another unwelcome flashing episode . ) Or if the invitation to sail is offered when both your friend and her husband are present , vou could accompany your refusal with an innuendo . Respond with " Last time I went , I felt nauseous , " and look pointedly at the husband . Photograph // Do n't worry-sooner or later , this marriage is bound to hit the rocks , and with any luck , she will throw him overboard . Q. I was in the bathroom stall and heard two of my coworkers ripping me apart . I waited until they left and then sneaked out . Should I get revenge or confront them and tell them what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them while it was happening ; an unexpected interjection ( " When you ladies are finished tearing me apart , make sure you tell them where to send my body " ) delivered from your stall might have shaken them up . After the fact , it 's a different story . Most people would tell you to ignore the incident . However , you might recruit a friend to follow one or both of the women into the bathroom . When your victim(s) is in the stall , you and your cohort proceed to malign her . When she emerges , tell her you did n't mean what you said-you just wanted her to know how it felt to be talked about that way ( Note : You wo n't win any awards for maturity , but it might make you feel better . ) Q. My two good friends-Betsy and Ceda-hate each other . Betsy is between apartments , so she 's staying with me . When Ceda visits , they refuse to speak to one another . The tension makes me so uncomfortable . What should I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Betsy and Ceda apart . For now , only see Ceda out-at a restaurant or her house . Option two is risky but worth trying . Lock your two friends in a room together , along with a chocolate cake and a bottle of wine . Do n't open the door until they 're buddies . Or until you hear things breaking . Q. I was out with my boyfriend and spotted my brother 's pregnant wife having a martini . My boyfriend said , " it 's just onemaybe it 's weak . " But when we left an hour later , she was still drinking ! My brother loves her and is excited to be a dad . I 'm afraid if I tell , he 'll accuse me of meddling since his wife and I have never been close . But if I keep my mouth shut , the baby 's nealth is at risk . What should I do ? A. While you are right about the dangers to the child , your helpful advice on this matter will be about as welcome as rain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for the best . You never know , maybe your sister-in-law likes to drink water from a martini glass . Of course , you could always go the cloakand-dagger route and enlist the help of a bar-stool pigeon . Hire a stranger to give your brother a tip about his wife 's drinking by leaving an anonymous message on his voice mail . But this scheme has its own risks-if your brother somehow traces the tip back to you , you could end up fatally injuring your aunthood . Q. I came out of the closet two years ago . My mom accepts my orientation , but she refuses to meet my girlfriend and insists I lie to my relatives . At family gatherings , my brother always brings a date and I 'm left alone . My aunt is forever asking , " What ' s up with your love life ? " and I dodge her questions . What should I do ? A. It sounds as if you are not really out of the closet but merely standing in the doorway . Next time you are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , why not whip out a picture of your girlfriend and let the chips fall where they may ? There will probably be a major family earthquake , followed by a series of aftershocks , but it sounds as if you 're too unhappy to let things lie . If your announcement is met with tears , threats , or insults , just keep smiling and repeating things like " I 've never been so happy in my whole life , " " You have to meet her ; she 's a beautiful person , " and " Please pass the vodka . " Q. I dropped my regular hairdresser after he gave me a series of bad cuts . now , I go to another stylist at the same salon , and my old hairdresser gives me dirty looks and whispers about me . Should I say something ? A. Unless you adore this new stylist , you should switch to another salon . Obviously , your ex-cutter is acting out his insecurities . If you simply ca n't live without your new stylist , solicit his help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to keep coming to him but wo n't be able to if your former hairdresser 's meanspiritedness continues . Just be careful : Once your ex-stylist knows you 're complaining about him , he could become dangerous-do n't let him get anywhere near you with a bottle of peroxide . Q. I 'm getting married next year , and already the family feuding has begun . Both my and my fiances 's parents are divorced and all exes hate each other . My father says he 'll only pay for the wedding if it 's at his place . My mother wo n't go if it 's there , and my finance 's mother wo n't come to the wedding-wherever it is-if my finance 's dad is invited . What should my finance and I do ? A. On word : Elope. under the very best of circumstances , weddings are stressful affairs that bring out the worst in everyone . And it sounds as though your guests would rather throw hand grenades than rice . After you 're safely married , tell your feuding family you decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate with each of them in their separate corners . But if you ca n't get over your need for a Here comes the bride , all dressed in white type of ceremony , you can have a secret one with trustworthy , closemouthed friends and tell your family you and your fiance went to City Hall by yourselves . Do n't let the issue of dishonesty bother you too much ; you will be doing everybody-ineluding yourselves-a big favor . Q. I married to an older man whose unmarried daughter recently moved into our guest house with her baby . Then she invited her mom to move in too . Now , I come home every day to my man 's ex sunbathing nude . He wo n't kick her out because she helps their daughter with the baby . But I 'm starting to think he enjoys it . How can I get rid of her ? A. You can't-not without getting rid of your stepdaughter and her child-and you ca n't do that without causing a rift between you and your husband . But you 're well within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this arrangement . Do n't show anyone-specially Mrs. Exyou are worried . Kill everyone with kindness . Do n't let them see you sweat . The only way to win the game is not to play . In the meantime , you can fight fire with fire . You have youth on your side , so who is your husband going to be more interested in seeing nude ? ( It 's not as if he has n't already seen everything she has . ) Pull out all the stops : Bring out the whipped cream . Meet him at the door wearing nothing but Christmas tinsel . Suggest a tropical vacation for two . In other words , distract him . You never know the competition may just spruce up your love life . cal vacations for two . In other words , distract him . You never know , the competition may just spruce up your love life . Q. Last year , my father was ill and my wicked stepmother used her role as caretaker to keep me away from him . I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered , she poisoned him against me by telling him I was n't around when he was sick . How can I stop this misinformation campaign without badmouthing her to my dad ? A. Like Cinderella , you need a fairy godmother . In other words , an ally who has you dad 's trust besides his wife , a person who can tell him how concerned you were when he was sick . If you do n't have an old friend or relative who can plead your case , your only alternative is to ignore the results ofthe stepmothers venom . Show him how much you love him ; do little things for him and tell him how happy you are to see him well . Have intimate father-daughter talks . You can only hope the damage that 's been done will fade . Unfortunately , if your dad 's willing to be putty in the hands of his malevolent mate , there 's not much you can do . But if you feel like dishing out a little subtle poison of your own , try using a few cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to spend time with you finally " and " Wow , Dad , your wife must love you a lot , she was so overprotective when you were sick !
