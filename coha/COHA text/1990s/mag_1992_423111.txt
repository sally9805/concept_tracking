<p> This Colorado artist and teacher works spontaneously , expressing a sense of his energy and excitement . <p> " Art is the thing I 've devoted my entire life to  --  it 's both my best friend and my lover , " says Ramon Kelley . " I 'm committed and addicted to making art . " <p> The artist 's brightly colored , exuberant paintings clearly reflect his excitement and passion . A painter of portraits , nudes , landscapes , and still lifes , this Denver , Colorado , teacher is comfortable working in almost any medium  --  oil acrylic , watercolor , pastel , Conte crayon , pen and ink , charcoal , and lithography  --  and he even does sculpture . Kelley , who always signs his name " Ramon , " is best known as a portrait painter ( " I could n't change that even if I wanted to , " he says . " People will always be involved in my work " ) ; his rich painting style enables him to portray masterfully people of all ages and cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are depicted in timeless , unidentifiable places against abstract backgrounds of elegantly interlaced light and shadow . <p> An avid student of art history , Kelley has a thorough understanding of basic artistic principles and continually calls upon them in creating his work . " I 'm a borrower , " he says . Kelley acknowledges his profound debt to the painterly portraits of Nicolai Fechin , an early-twentieth century Russian artist who settled in the Southwest . Other artists whose work has had an impact on Kelley are the Italian artist Antonio Mancini , John Singer Sargent , and Joaquin Sorolla Kelley says , " When Sorolla was asked When do you paint ? , ' he answered , I 'm always painting , even when I 'm sitting here talking to you . ' I 've always thought that was a magnificent statement . I 'm always painting in my mind 's eye , even when I 'm away from the easel . " <p> Born in Cheyenne , Wyoming , fifty-three years ago , Kelley has spent nearly forty years painting both in his mind 's eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artwork since he was in his early twenties . When Kelley first began exhibiting at the prestigious Jan Hiatt Gallery in Taos , New Mexico , his work primarily consisted of softfocus , black-and-white portrait drawings . Hiatt had spent a year selling these charcoal and pen-and-ink works when she told him , " People want to know what you can do with paint . " Kelley recalls , " The word paint scared me . Essentially , I was forced to use color . " Kelley nevertheless persisted in finding a way to incorporate paint into his work . Now , his use of vibrant patches of color has become his signature style . <p> " When I first started using color , " he says , " I did n't know about color temperature ; I always used warm hues . I used a warm pastel stick  --  ochre or burnt sienna , for example  --  to suggest color over a charcoal drawing . Then I became more adventurous . Pretty soon , I began and consequently discovered that if you can paint in three colors , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I 've put a warm tone such as ochre in the skin , I can put a cool color near it and the skin will glow a little more . I know that when I paint a portrait in warm earth tones and then add a note of cobalt blue , it 's just going to zing . " <p> For example , in the oil painting The Parade  --  Geese , Kelley says , " Nature determined the color and composition for me with the beautiful , warm autumn tones in the landscape and the coolness of the water and sky . This combination gave my painting a wonderful contrast . " His work Launching the Flat is also energized by warm-cool contrasts . In this pastel painting , which focuses on what the artist calls " the force of the manpower launching the boat , " Kelley accentuated the contrasts in color temperature by working on a neutral gray paper , highlighting the warm colors on the fisherman 's bodies . He dealt with similar problems in the oil An old Mexican Mission . " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the building , " he explains . " Again , nature solved the problem for me ; I found that the colorful figures acted as beautiful accents against the soft , warm tones on the old mission building . " <p> Kelley always works alla prima ; he does n't do a lot of preparatory sketches and relishes the spontaneity of working without a plan . His intention , he says , is to " create a suggestion of form with beautiful colors , not to work on the painting in an overly detailed way . " In his oils , which are usually completed in one session , he plays off sections of heavy paint with thinner layers , combining transparent washes with areas of opaque paint . Using Blockx , Winsor &; Newton , and Sennelier colors , he begins by laying down his brush strokes directly , covering the surface with bold washes of color ; he never preserves the white of the canvas or paper . <p> When he is working on a portrait , Kelley says , " Paint quality takes precedence over likeness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I prefer to strongly suggest features using a limited amount of detail  --  I do n't want to become so preoccupied with creating a resemblance that I forget about the rich quality of the brush stroke or the beautiful composition that can make the painting special . " <p> In portraits such as Blue Beard or the one demonstrated in the " Nuts &; Bolts " section in this issue , Kelley begins a work by making large shapes in broad washes . He starts with the placement of forms on his surface , his first strokes of color being the darkest darks ; he leaves areas of light open . He likens this progression from light to dark to building a sculpture . <p> He continues by broadly laying in middle tones on dark and cool areas , adding the shadows and then focusing on details . " By the time I get to this modeling stage , " he says , " I 'm close to finished . " If necessary , he may lighten the painting in places to create highlights . He also adds touches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palette knife to create interest . At this point , Kelley focuses on the warm-cool contrasts to " add excitement and finish the painting , " he says . <p> Kelley may also combine mediums to achieve a simpler , more immediate effect . For instance , of Blue Beard , a pastel , the artist says , " I used a watercolor underpainting , making tonal shapes and then going over them with pastel . " He began by blocking in the forms with watercolor , a shortcut that allowed him to build the basic constructions so that he could work spontaneously . " The watercolor acted as a map , " he says , pointing to the blocked-in glasses , beard , and hair of the model as examples of the simplicity that this method produces . <p> In all of his oils , Kelley juxtaposes rough , wide strokes of larger brushes with softer , more delicate brushwork. on portraits , for instance , large marks will be used for the subject 's clothing and the background , while smaller , more delicate ones will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with energy by placing marks in contrasting directions . He also uses his fingers for blending both oils and pastels . <p> Kelley works on the background and foreground of his paintings simultaneously " so these areas are always et the same stage of completeness , " he explains . Typically , he leaves the background undefined , but he does not separate it from the painting 's subject . " The background has to grow right along with painting  --  it 's less important than the figure , but it ca n't just be left to be filled in at the last moment , " he states . " It 's important to move around the picture continuously , not to focus on one thing exclusively . " <p> A studio painter who rarely works outdoors , Kelley has designed a comfortable work area in a turn-of-the-century church building furnished with interesting antiques and two easels . The studio is equipped with Criticolor lights to illuminate the space with simulated natural light when the artist works at night . Also housed in the building is Kelley 's ever-growing collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Navy and adds to during his travels . Many of the books feature large , color reproductions of the works of the painterly Russian artists he loves , such as Fechin and Ilya Repin . <p> Although he is an established artist who makes a comfortable living , Kelley has continued to experiment and grow , refusing to allow himself to become too set in his ways . Recently , he has begun making both sculptures and lithographs and feels that his work in these mediums has informed his paintings . He says that sculpting from live models , for example , has assisted his understanding of the human figure . <p> A member of the National Academy of Western Art , the American Watercolor Society , the Allied Artists of America , and the National Arts Club , Kelley was designated a Master Pastellist in 1985 by the Pastel Society of America and was elected to that group 's Hall of Fame in 1986 . His work is in the collections of Seattle 's Frye Museum of Fine Art in Washington , the Santa Fe Museum of Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America Culture in Washington , and the Academy at West Point in New York . Last year , he was elected to the Colorado Institute of Arts Hall of Fame . <p> Kelley has had solo shows at the Gerald Peters Gallery in Santa Fe , New Mexico , and Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City , and will be participating in a group show opening June 19 at the Bentana Art Gallery in Santa Fe , New Mexico . Coauthor with Mary Carroll Nelson of Ramon Kelley Paints Portraits and Figures , he is also featured in Joe Singer 's How to Paint Figures in Pastel ( both published by Watson-Guptill Publications ) . Kelley is well known for the workshops he teaches around the country . Currently , he is organizing a workshop in his Denver studio that will run from June 8through June 12 .
