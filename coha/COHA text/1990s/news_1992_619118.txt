<p> OF 15,000 Jewish children who passed through the Terezin ( Czechoslovakia ) concentration camp between 1941 and 1945 , Zuzana Pick Justman was one of the lucky 100 who survived . For two years from age 11 to 13 , the Czech youngster observed the strange paradoxes in what the Nazis called a " spa " for the Jews , but what was actually a way station on the road to the Auschwitz extermination camp . <p> Although she tried to repress that memory for years , she still dreamed about telling the true story of the bizarre ghetto town where art and death co-existed . In 1986 , she began interviewing other survivors who had lost their childhood at the place the Germans called Theresienstadt . In " Terezin Diary , " a documentary written and produced by Justman , 10 men and women speak judiciously and calmly about the grim reality behind the smiling faces shown in clips from the Nazi propaganda film , " Hitler Gives the Jews a City . " <p> In October 1941 , the Germans had evacuated the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to house Czech Jews until they could be sent to the East . By 1944 it was " transformed "  --  temporarily  --  into a " show " camp so that the International Red Cross could tell the world about the marvelous conditions there  --  and the Red Cross fell for the Nazi hoax . The German ploy was so successful that a film was made to commemorate their achievement . <p> The truth was something else , as Justman 's film demonstrates . Directed by Dan Weissman and narrated by Eli Wallach , the documentary will be shown at 7 p.m . Saturday , 4 p.m. next Sunday , and 4 p.m . February 16 at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley . At 8:45 p.m . Saturday and 7 p.m . February 2 , there will be screenings of the acclaimed documentary , " The Architecture of Doom , " Peter Cohen 's film linking the roots of Hitler 's extermination campaign to Nazi aesthetics and art . On Sunday , at 4 p.m. the program is " The Distant Journey , " directed by Alfred Radok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylized danse macabre . . . outrageous and grotesque , " also deals with the Terezin experience . <p> The films are being shown in conjunction with the only West Coast exhibition of " Seeing Through Paradise : Artists and the Terezin Concentration Camp . " It opens Saturday at the UC Art Museum in Berkeley and runs through March 22 . This historic show , compiled by the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston , includes nearly 100 paintings and drawings created by 17 artists who were incarcerated in Terezin . They surreptitiously managed to draw  --  and hide  --  a devastating record of the starvation and fear that dominated the " model " camp . Nearly all of the artists were killed in the gas chambers or died of diseases brought on by poor living conditions . <p> Although circumstances were better at Terezin than in the extermination camps , 33,000 prisoners died there from malnutrition , disease and starvation . Of the 140,000 people sent to Terezin , 87,000 left the ghetto in transports , mostly to Auschwitz . <p> Like the 10 survivors in the documentary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equanimity  --  even though it took 10 years before she could accept the fact that her father was sent to the Auschwitz gas chambers . Child of a wealthy Prague family , she matured prematurely during the two years in Terezin . <p> " My life changed gradually after Hitler , " Justman said at her artistically decorated Manhattan apartment . " Then came the edicts and prohibitions and the order to wear a yellow star . Jewish children were not allowed to go to school . I stopped after third grade . We were n't permitted to watch movies . Our housekeeper , who saw every film and had pictures of all the Hollywood stars , would tell us the stories when she came home . I remember a day after my father 's chemical products factory was taken over by the Germans , he left the house and my mother realized to her horror that he had forgotten to wear his star and she ran after him  --  because you had to worry about people in the streets who might inform on you . " <p> For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wonderful imaginable because all the best intellectuals in Prague who were kicked out of their jobs taught there . " After less than a year , that school , too , was closed and the teachers were sent to concentration camps . The Pick family 's move to Terezin was postponed for a year after Zuzana came down with scarlet fever and German authorities were afraid she would infect other evacuees . <p> Late in 1943 , Zuzana , her parents and her 17-year-old brother were sent to Terezin , where they first shared a loft with 100 other people . Her brother soon succumbed to polio and tuberculosis . Her mother , who was involved in a food smuggling operation , was arrested and spent two or three months in an underground cell at Gestapo headquarters . Every day Zuzana would stand in the street near that building while her mother pulled herself up on a chain to peer out of a little window at the top of her cell to catch a glimpse of her daughter . Her father , who could n't cope with the change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly to Zuzana for decisions . <p> " We did everything we could think of to get my mother out of prison . We went to see an important man in the Jewish council and he advised us to volunteer for transport and my father asked me . . . what did I think . I was only 12 and had to do the cooking and cleaning and packing . All our possessions were thrown into one case . And I thought , ' Oh , my God , if we go to Auschwitz , I 'll have to pack . ' So I said I did n't think we should go . That probably saved our lives , but most of the time we were n't allowed to make any decisions . " Soon after , her father was sent to the extermination camp . <p> The postwar years brought other troubles when the Communist regime took power . Her uncles , who had escaped to Argentina before the war , insisted that she and her mother return to Buenos Aires with them . Zuzana wanted to stay in Prague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had the distinction of being kicked out of the Communist party twice , she said fondly . The second time was because he could n't resist a joke . The leading political/literary paper asked intellectuals in which direction the country should be heading . He answered with the title of a best-selling book at that time : " Far From Moscow . " Her own left sympathies came to an abrupt end in Argentina when her old housekeeper sent her a review of " Cyrano " with her favorite Czech actor , but it got a rigid Marxist analysis . " It made me sick , " she recalled . <p> SHE hated Argentina because of the Peronist politics , but used her time there to study English and won a scholarship to Vassar College on the basis of a letter about why she wanted to come to America . " It was probably the corniest essay in the history of admissions , " she said , " but I was in love with democracy and I meant every word . " <p> Later , marriage , motherhood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who had been through the camps , I thought that being with my two sons was the most important thing I could do . But then I broke all records in the length of time it took for me to get my doctorate at Columbia . " <p> Meanwhile in Czechoslovakia , the 40-year iron curtain of silence about Terezin and the Jewish fate was gradually being lifted . In 1986 , the Communist government permitted a reunion of Terezin inmates . Justman thought it was a sign of fate for her to begin the documentary . A neighbor who worked for the New York educational TV channel encouraged her and brought her together with Weissman , who had made a documentary on the Jewish Museum in Prague . <p> They arranged for a 10-day shooting schedule around the time of the reunion on Sept. 30 , 1986 . " Only about 60 people from Czechoslovakia came , " she recalled . " I think others were still afraid to be identified as Jews . I interviewed four people there , including Helga Kinski , who became our key witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strongly with them . Some people say , ' Is n't it wonderful that Helga is so positive ? ' But the last thing she says is that the memory of the friends who died will stay with her forever . <p> " I get very upset when people , who ca n't possibly imagine the way we lived , talk about the ' triumph of the human spirit ' among survivors . It was a horrendous experience that crippled a lot of people and had tragic consequences . Everybody has been marked in a negative way . " <p> Now Justman is raising money for the new Terezin museum that was launched by the new democratic Czech government last October on the 50th anniversary of the camp 's establishment . The documentary , which will be shown on Czech television in the next few months , will be in the museum archives as a permanent memorial and refutation to those who claim that the Holocaust never happened . In the words of author Arnost Lustig , who spent two years at Terezin : " The city is still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere we have been and of everything we have lived through . . . I still bear the scars  --  the visible and the invisible ones . "
