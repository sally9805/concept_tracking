<p> OUTSIDE the White House , a peace activist waves a hand-drawn sign declaring : " Hey , George , your bishop is on our side ! " <p> Indeed , the president 's pastor , the Most Rev. Edmond Browning , presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the USA , opposed the Gulf war long before the bombs flew . He still does . <p> " A great shadow has fallen over what appeared to be a bright new landscape , " Bishop Browning told delegates at the current World Council of Churches meeting in Canberra , Australia . " The new world order looks suspiciously like the old , with bombs and bullets doing all the talking . " <p> The president acknowledges the bishop 's protests . " I hate to have my bishop in opposition to me , " Mr. Bush reportedly said . <p> Browning 's voice , like other war opponents ' , was overwhelmed for a while by the roar of laser-guided bombs . But now , as civilian casualties rise in Baghdad and Iraq 's military losses skyrocket under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> Last Sunday , a man shouting war protests was thrown out of a church service that the president and Mrs. Bush attended in Kennebunkport , Maine . <p> To stop war <p> The National Council of Churches , at the Canberra meeting , issued a call for dialogue among Muslims , Christians , and Jews " to address our fears , concerns , and hopes for peace . " Bishop Melvin Talbert of the United Methodist Church explains that " the most patriotic thing religious leaders in our country can do is stop the war . " <p> Protests are escalating outside Christian churches as well . The Soviet Union charges in the newspaper Isvestia that Desert Storm has become " Desert Slaughter . " <p> Angry Arab crowds in Jordan scrawl " Bush the Butcher " outside the US Embassy . <p> Near the White House , antiwar activists beat drums of protest day and night . <p> A full-scale ground war , with much higher casualties , could create a fresh wave of protest , much it from church leaders . <p> Sir Paul Reeves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says bluntly : " The escalation of the Gulf war is neither holy nor just . " <p> Reeves says the war is strengthening four great evils : maldistribution of wealth , social injustice , militarism , and irreparable environmental damage . <p> Not all theologians agree , of course . The archbishop-elect of Canterbury , George Carey , calls this " a justifiable war . " <p> As he told the Episcopal News Service : " I have always questioned the just-war theory ... But I believe that certain wars are justifiable , even if not entirely just . I believe this is a justifiable war , but I would n't want to say it is holy , and I certainly would n't want to say it is just . " <p> Bush insists the war rests on a firm moral footing . According to the Feb. 25 New Republic , he told a senior staff meeting last month : <p> " I 've reconciled all the moral issues . It 's black versus white , good versus evil . " <p> For hundreds of years , Christian theologians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Until about 400 AD , early Christians opposed all war . Then , as the Christian movement was subsumed by the Roman Empire , clerics like St. Augustine began looking for ways to reconcile the use of force . <p> Eventually , the Christian church 's growing acceptance of war resulted in the Crusades , military expeditions of the 11th-13th centuries to recover the Holy Land from the Muslims . <p> David Little , a scholar at the US Institute for Peace , says Christian thinking on war today can be divided into three major groups : pacifists ( such as Quakers ) , " just war " advocates ( such as President Bush ) , and those who support " holy war , " in which " if you have the word of the Lord at your side , then do n't hold back . " <p> Elements of ' just war ' <p> When Congress debated the Gulf war last month , most of the arguments centered on the " just-war " question . Dr. Little says there are several critical elements to a just war . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-defense . <p> * Right intentions . <p> * High probability of success . <p> * Public declaration of intent . <p> * Protection for noncombatants . <p> * Proportionality . <p> * Last resort , when peaceful means have failed . <p> Three of those elements are at risk in Iraq . <p> The first is protection for noncombatants . When a Stealth aircraft hit a Baghdad shelter with two 2,000-pound bombs last week , scores of civilians were apparently killed . It may have been either a US or Iraqi mistake , but public opinion , particularly in the Middle East , was inflamed . <p> The second element at risk is proportionality . Bush 's goal is the freedom of Kuwait , a nation of 1.8 million . But how many people must be killed to free Kuwait : 10,000 ? 100,000 ? 500,000 ? <p> Some 525,000 Iraqi soldiers , mostly draftees , are occupying Kuwait , where they are are enduring the largest aerial bombardment in the history of mankind . Tens of thousands may already have been killed . US officials refuse to give estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuwait 's freedom ? Is the destruction of human life out of proportion to the goal ? <p> " That 's is a very difficult question , " says Dr. Little . " The proportionality criterion is not awfully scientific . There is n't any calculus you can use ... You have to use circumstantial judgment about how important this is , and what costs this is worth . " <p> The ' last resort ' <p> The third element at risk is the " last resort " component . Sissela Bok , a philosophy professor at Brandeis University , says she would have preferred to give economic sanctions more time . <p> " I felt we would run into far greater tragedies than those who started the war expected , " Dr. Bok says . " It 's now important to ask those who thought the war would have been over in six days whether they still agree with it . " <p> On Dec. 20 , before the fighting began , Bush privately debated some of these issues with his bishop at the White House . Bush argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuwait " made war with Iraq a moral imperative . <p> Recalling the Nazi terror of the 1930s , Bush wondered if a strong stand like his own in this war might have halted the mass executions of Jews and Polish patriots during World War II . <p> Browning answered the president in a joint statement with other church leaders : <p> " War will not liberate Kuwait , it will destroy it , " he said . " War will not establish regional stability , it will inflame the entire Middle East . "
