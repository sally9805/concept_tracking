When Evans Paul , the youthful mayor of Port-au-Prince who has been in hiding from the Haitian junta for the past three years , emerged to reclaim his office last Thursday , he brought along a kind of personal insurance policy : 40 American MPs and soldiers from the U.S. Army 's 10th Mountain Division . Under their watchful gaze , the man who is second in popularity to President Jean- Bertrand Aristide was able to deliver an emotional speech celebrating the end of military rule and admonishing his fellow Haitians to exercise patience , mercy and restraint . His only rhetorical barb was reserved for junta leader Lieut . General Raoul Cedras . " Bye lakou blanche ! " he declared . Rough translation : " Hit the road ! " <P> Bold words . Too bold , perhaps . Barely two hours after the mayor 's address , an explosive device was tossed from a seaside warehouse , tearing into a crowd of several thousand celebrating Paul 's return . The blast killed six , injured another 43 and sparked a rampage by furious Aristide supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath on several men suspected of throwing the bomb , the crowd turned on the warehouse itself . And in a sample of what rich Haitians have predicted could engulf the entire country , the throng stripped the building bare . They took everything : steel drums , bags of cement , iron bars , even coils of wire  --  but this time no Americans intervened . <P> The melees underscored the volatile state of affairs in the capital and the precariousness of American control , despite an overwhelming military superiority . On Friday hours of looting and a bloody street battle marred a democracy march marking the three-year anniversary of Aristide 's ouster . As gunmen loyal to the military junta fired into the lines of marchers near the headquarters of the paramilitary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti , or FRAPH , dozens of militiamen armed with machetes and sticks fought viciously with Aristide supporters . By the end of the day , at least six had died and 20 more were wounded . This time too U.S. troops made no effort to break up the violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed belonged to the police . <P> By Saturday , the attaches ' first brutal attacks had succeeded in violently dismantling three separate pro-democracy marches . Gunmen swaggered through the streets of the capital , boasting that they would kill anyone who tried to shut them down . Such eruptions of violence dispelled the spin , confidently put forward by one Clinton Administration official , that everything was going well and unfolding according to a White House plan " adopted months before we went ashore . " Americans were confused by successive scenes of trouble in Haiti : sometimes U.S. soldiers stepped in , sometimes they did not . The true nature of American involvement remained hazy as the troops struggled to keep their balance between bitterly opposing camps in a dangerously uneasy climate , and the Administration tried to gauge what Congress would tolerate . As U.S. lawmakers began debating setting a date for withdrawal , the disorder offered a graphic reminder of how vulnerable Bill Clinton 's policy is when mayhem erupts in Haiti .               @ @ @ @ @ @
