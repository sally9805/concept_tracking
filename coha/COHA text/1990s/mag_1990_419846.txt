<p> My wife handed our neighbor a photograph showing a green , pop-eyed , three-horned , helmeted creature with one handlike claw pointing retriever-style . " He belongs to us and he escaped . " The man , standing in his doorway , stared at the picture , struggling to make sense of it . " He 's very slow and hard to see . Check the tops of your bushes , " my wife implored . The man returned the picture to her , clearly convinced he was dealing with a lunatic . " Do n't worry . Chameleons ca n't hurt you , " she said . The man silently turned , shut the door and locked it . <p> It would be hard to design creatures less dangerous than Old World chameleons . They are n't the slim , green lizards that children buy at carnivals . True chameleons look like antediluvian monsters . Their ability to change color and pattern is the least of their oddities . With eyeballs that rotate independently like the turrets of a B-17 , ludicrous threat displays , prehensile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues , and lolling gait-all wrapped in a baroque assemblage of crests , horns , helmets , flaps and frills-chameleons inspire mirth rather than menace . While almost all chameleons live in Africa or Madagascar , the common , or Mediterranean , chameleon ranges throughout the Middle East , some Aegean and Mediterranean islands , along the coast of North Africa and into southern Spain . Chameleon subspecies occur in the Arabian peninsula , India and Sri Lanka . Chameleons inhabit the jungles of the Congo Basin , the desiccated wastes of the Namib Desert , and the hedgerows of Nairobi . Some species survive rare snowfalls on Africa 's equatorial peaks . Most chameleons belong to the genus Chamaeleo , but a fraction of them fall into one other genus-or several , depending on which expert is consulted . <p> Chameleons are largely arboreal and rarely visit terra firma except to lay eggs or to engage in courtship . Most species spend the bulk of their day colored like bark or leaves , an effect magnified by the lizards ' flat , ovoid shape . A chameleon rocks back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often it will wait for the wind to stir the branches before it moves , its prehensile tail stretched straight , for balance . The same tail can wind around a branch for security when the animal feeds or makes a tricky maneuver . When a chameleon feels secure or wants to show off , it curls its tail in a tight spiral . I saw one catch a branch with its tail after free-falling several feet . <p> With toes bundled together for stability and strength , each foot forms a " V. " The front feet have two toes bundled on the outside , three on the inside ; the rear feet have the opposite arrangement . If disturbed while sleeping , some species reflexively drop to the ground , perhaps eluding capture by a snake or femur . Juveniles and smaller species often jump when approached , but you should n't conjure up a vision of a gymnast going for the gold . A chameleon lands like a bag of groceries . <p> Chameleons walk on the tips of their claws , feet splayed wide , reptilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence on a bush takes on a goofy , conspicuous character on land-like a mime portraying a drunk at half speed-which only serves to draw attention , not conceal . Even when chameleons Hee in panic , they may cover less than 20 feet a minute . If exposed or cornered , their best defense is a fierce , aggressive display in which the chameleon puffs itself up with air and makes a hissing sound . It works : one field biologist has observed a chameleon warding off a pack of wild dogs with its bluff . <p> Our escapee was a male Jackson 's chameleon , indigenous to the forests of Kenya and Tanzania . Strutting about with plodding solemnity , three horns sprouting from his armored skull , he resembled a shrunken triceratops . Not all chameleons grow horns . Some possess only a vestigial stump , while others glory in four fully developed horns , whose function seems to be to impress females and intimidate rivals . <p> A little more than a dozen years ago , my wife and I found our first chameleons , a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a California pet store . Their outrageous appearance and erratic movements fascinated us . Even though we had no idea of what the creatures needed , it was clear to us that the pet shop employees knew less-crickets , intended as chameleon fodder , roamed the cage untouched . With prehensile tails and feet designed for gripping , these were obviously arboreal lizards , but the staff provided no branches for them . They sat in the corners , scratching on the glass with one foot , eyes rotating . We visited the shop daily for a week . Day by day their bowl of water evaporated . It turns out that Jackson's-like most chameleons-will drink only by lapping water droplets off a leaf . We could stand it no longer . We paid the bail and sprung them . Later , more chameleons joined us . <p> Apparently , our Jackson 's adhere to the New Hampshire motto , " Live free or die , " so we accommodated them by stringing ropes across our ceiling , creating lizard highways . Given the run of the house , the chameleons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only veering to the curtains to bask in sunbeams . And they had one trait that any parent would envy : all fell asleep when we switched off the lights . <p> The lizards flourished . We rejoiced . But soon they lost all desire for crickets . Mealworms rekindled their appetite , but boredom soon set in . My wife and I could be found on sunny days crawling around our yard looking for tasty invertebrates as our fussy eaters sunned themselves in the garden . We tried to shoo away bees and wasps , but the Jackson 's still hunted them . When one did zap a bee , it would sit with its mouth open , like an incautious diner at a Thai restaurant . The population of spiders and flies dwindled around our house that year . <p> Our chameleons revealed their authentic personalities outdoors . In the California summer we kept them outside in a chicken-wire cage . When the morning sun first struck them , they curved one side of their bodies toward the light . They flattened their bodies and thrust out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing the sun turned almost black to absorb the rays , while the other side stayed green . If a twig blocked some of the sun , a stripe of green skin would mark the shadow . After a few minutes , warm and fully charged , they returned to their normal color and began hunting insects . They rocked on branches , avoiding detection by moving with determined indecision . A passing bird or plane froze them in position , one eye " turret " tracking the threat . <p> In the course of keeping chameleons I have learned how vulnerable these grotesquely engaging creatures are . We turned over our house to them , trapped insects to please their palates , found a vet who would treat them with antibiotics and operate on them when necessary-and still they died . Because symptoms of illness are not obvious , chameleons are high-maintenance charges for even the most dedicated . <p> No amount of loving care could keep our Jackson 's alive for longer than two years . Some died in a month or two from stress . Without abundant sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide temperature variations daily to survive . Dietary variety is a must . Compared with Senegals. the most commonly imported chameleons today-Jackson 's are somewhat hardier . But they are still fragile indeed . <p> Today , there is an even more alarming reason to resist chameleon ownership : the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) officially lists all chameleons under " threatened status . " The ominous explanation is that wild chameleons are concentrated in areas like Madagascar and Africa , where habitat is being desolated by development . <p> " The major problem , " according to Richard Leakey , director of the Kenya Wildlife Service , " is , of course , habitat destruction . Many chameleons are quite habitatspecific . When we destroy a particular habitat , we can eliminate a particular species . For this reason , some chameleons should certainly be listed as endangered rather than threatened . And the last thing we would want is to compound the problem by encouraging the pet trade . " <p> The desire for chameleons as exotic pets indisputably has taken its toll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into the United States has tripled , from about 5,000 in 1985 to about 15,000 in 1989 . Some of the larger species are selling for $2,000 apiece . Figures on how many of these imported species survive do not exist , but experts agree that mortality rates for chameleons , which are often shipped under shockingly inadequate conditions , are high . When chameleons are collected in the wild for importers they are frequently torn off branches ; because they hang on so tightly , their bones break . Typically , the lizards are shipped to a dealer , who keeps them for a while . A month may go by during which they are without food or water . Usually they land at a pet shop half-dead from malnutrition and so stressed that they are unable to fend off parasites . Even if the chameleons arrive healthy , few pet store workers have the expertise to care for them . People buy them , and a few weeks later the lizards are dead . <p> When my wife and I first started keeping chameleons the information available on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future for chameleons becomes increasingly precarious , more wildlife biologists are studying these fascinating and puzzling creatures while there is still time . Recently , for instance , experts learned of the existence of the first species to be identified on the Greek mainland . <p> Ongoing studies cover everything from behavior to physiology . When Jonathan Losos , an evolutionary biologist from the University of California , Berkeley , set off for Nairobi , he was about to think , breathe and dream chameleons for more than two months . His expedition , headed by Al Bennett from the University of California , Irvine , ranged throughout Kenya . The purpose was to study how several closely related species evolved in their adaptation to different climates . <p> The biologists collected chameleons from distinct habitats at varying elevations-plucking them from temperate Nairobi gardens , from the slopes of Mount Kenya , where temperatures can fall to freezing , and from the hot , arid scrublands along the Tanzanian border . Collecting did present some drawbacks . " Oh yes , they bite all the time , " Losos reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He and his colleagues hope to elucidate the physiology of adaptation to climate-a process that becomes increasingly important to understand as global warming occurs . Caring for lizards round the clock <p> Curious about the movement of chameleons from one branch to another , biologist Jane Peterson of the University of Southern California has filmed and analyzed the " slow acrobatics " of her chameleon subjects . She has studied these creatures since her first research group of 75 arrived in terrible condition ten years ago . They had been left on a dock in Portugal because of a shipping error ; she cared for them round the clock to keep them alive . <p> Peterson has concentrated on the musculature and bone structure of lizards , focusing on the shoulder . She discovered that some chameleons seem to have adapted in a way similar to primates , relying on rotating shoulder joints for movement . These flexible joints allow them to reach with their forelimbs in any direction for a branch and to span distances twice their body length . She speculates that this slow , methodical movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call attention to themselves . <p> Researchers , along with everybody else , are also intrigued by the chameleon 's ability to change color . Chameleons alter their color according to light intensity , state of health , temperature and mood-not to match background . The story of a chameleon succumbing in its attempt to match a plaid shirt has no basis in fact . Contrary to myth , most color changes make them more conspicuous . Along with strong light , the acts of courting and of defending territory provoke the most dramatic transformations . When angry , our Jackson 's changed from their usual uniform pale green to a mottled charcoal in less than a minute , and a diamond pattern appeared when they cruised the ceiling ropes . One male yellowed his lips to woo his would-be girlfriend , and another came out of surgery completely black . When the vet put him in my wife 's hand , he quickly returned to a soft green . <p> Special cells containing various pigments lie in several distinct skin layers . Just under the outer skin lies a stratum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer containing blue , white , red , orange and violet color cells . The deepest layer holds the brown-to-black pigment melanin , the substance responsible for tanning in humans . Melanin cells have a many-branched structure , so they can disperse the dark pigment from their center into their outer " arms , " which reach into the upper skin layers . A stressed chameleon sends melanin toward the skin surface , blocking the layer of white cells and darkening the animal . Other color cells can expand or shrink : if yellow cells enlarge over blue cells , for instance , a calm green color results . While researchers believe they understand the mechanics of color change , the process for triggering the correct pattern-the link from brain to skin-remains a subject for investigation . Displaying a puffed-up persona <p> Chameleons live solitary lives . Males , in particular , guard their territory jealously . Any intruder merits vigorous countermeasures . For most , territorial battles consist of aggressive displays , not physical contests . When two rivals meet , they turn sideways to the threat , flatten their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They puff themselves up , presenting a literally inflated image . They replace mundane colors and patterns with a vibrant combination intended to intimidate . Both contenders understand the symbolism . <p> Finally they open their mouths , exposing the contrasting colors of their mucous membranes ; this is often accompanied by a choreography of swaying and bobbing , punctuated by soft hisses . In most species , this signals the end of the conflict , as one of the antagonists will usually concede esthetic defeat and slink away , but several of the larger varieties will charge and inflict real damage , sometimes killing the adversary . <p> The eye is an optic wonder . Only the pupil peers out of a protruding dome of skin . Each eye takes in 180 degrees and operates independently of the other . How the creature 's tiny brain can process shifting , complex spatial information is still something of a mystery . A chameleon can hunt and spy on predators without moving its head or body . Without both eyes functioning optimally , it will starve , unable to gauge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphically the chameleon 's dependence on eye-to-tongue coordination . She fitted out her subjects with custom-made goggles , distorting the magnification in the lenses . All chameleons so hindered were unable to capture the insects of their choice . ) <p> When a chameleon spots a likely meal , both eyes converge on the target , giving the lizard a silly , crosseyed look . After it rocks a bit to enhance its stereoscopic vision and confirm the range-a fraction of an inch off will cause a miss-its lightning tongue shoots out . <p> The tongue can extend as much as one and a half times the lizard 's body length with dead-eye accuracy and blurring speed . A five-and-one-half-inch tongue reaches full extension in one-sixteenth of a second , fast enough to pluck a fly from the air . The tip of the tongue resembles a club . It 's covered with a sticky saliva , and its abrasive surface grips as it sticks to the target , then reels the food in . Wet worms or slugs frustrate the system because the tongue wo n't stick . <p> Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where two-thirds of the world 's species are concentrated . Before that island broke away from the African continent in the Mesozoic period , researchers believe , " proto " chameleons may have existed there . ( The oldest known fossil chameleons date from the Miocene , tens of millions of years later . ) Or , later chameleon emigres may have floated over on " rafts " of vegetation . <p> On Madagascar , chameleons embarked on divergent evolutionary journeys . Both the Oustalet 's and Parson 's chameleons may surpass two feet in length , zapping small rodents two feet away with their sticky tongues . The pardalis chameleon 's quick color changes would fool anyone into thinking he had seen two different animals , and the jewel chameleon looks like a section from a Jackson ( no relation ) Pollock canvas . So far , the headlong deforestation of the island has n't affected chameleons as cruelly as it has the femurs and other indigenous animals . When a plantation supplants a forest , the more adaptable lizards may simply move into coffee groves , but other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of extinction . For captive breeding , slow progress <p> For some chameleon species , the only hope may be captive breeding . ( Successful propagation of this kind would also reduce the demand for imported chameleons . ) Several zoos and at least one dealer are attempting captive breeding programs . Progress has been slow ; the lizards do not reproduce well in captivity . <p> Laying eggs is a hazardous enterprise that the female chameleon undergoes several times a year . She descends from the trees and burrows deep in the ground ; preparing a suitable space takes at least a day . After laying her eggs , usually from 30 to 50 , she fills the tunnel and taps the ground flat with her feet . All this activity occurs in broad daylight . Months later the young emerge , hunting from the moment they hit the surface , all weapons systems operating at 100-percent efficiency . Still , mortality is high . Birds , shrews , snakes and lizards feed on the tiny animals . <p> Some African mainland chameleons , like Jackson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We watched a pet Jackson 's give birth to 38 babies from a top a curtain rod . The newborns , encased in a thin membrane , hit the carpet , fought their way free and climbed to safety . We bought infant crickets for them , which they zapped on the first try . In the forest the mother would have pressed the offspring against the branch , and their sticky membranes would have adhered , but these newborns seemed unfazed by their fall . <p> California is the chameleon capital of the United States , and San Diego is their mecca-balmy temperatures and almost daily sun allow the lizards to be left outdoors , where they flourish . Cheryl DeWitt , a highly respected chameleon owner in the area , has had marked success in the difficult arena of chameleon breeding . When we visited her home , she was wearing a brightred shirt blazoned with a gold lizard outline . Mesh cages and glass tanks holding more than a hundred reptiles lined the walls . An Egyptian chameleon balanced on a houseplant to bask under a lamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cages sat on the sun deck , each with a chameleon occupying a plant . " The Jackson 's stay out unless there 's a frost . They like the temperature change , but I bring the others in at night , " DeWitt said . <p> " Chameleons are creatures of habit , ? ' she continued . " The Egyptian on the plant treks to the bottom of the stairs at 10 in the morning and waits for me to take him outside . And Mr. Rainbow , my male pardalis , climbs down from his curtain rod , where he sleeps , to fight with his reflection in a mirror every morning . " When we visited Mr. Rainbow , he was engaged in combat with his mirror image , eyeball to eyeball with his stubborn opponent . Plainly , Mr. Rainbow deserves his name . As he fought he sported bright yellow tinged with rust , with vertical olive-green stripes and an irregular horizontal swath of aqua . An angry vermilion flamed on his throat . After DeWitt transferred him to a sunlit bush , his colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female onto the scene provoked yet another pattern . " He uses specific patterns for each situation , " DeWitt explained . The female remained unimpressed , hissing and opening her jaws wide . <p> As DeWitt continued her tour , she held an infant Jackson 's perched on her fingertip , incipient horns budding on his forehead . " Some chameleons can adapt to loss of habitat , but most wo n't , " she said . " If we do n't learn how to raise them in captivity , we 'll lose a lot of varieties soon . I intend to do my part . " <p> At the San Diego Zoo , where a number of chameleons thrive , reptile expert Susan Shafer has unequivocal praise for Cheryl DeWitt : " She 's doing a magnificent job , but this is a rare exception . Pet owners should not try to take on captive breeding . It 's a task that requires extraordinary devotion .
