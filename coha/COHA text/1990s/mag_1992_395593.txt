We sat , Tammy and I , silent and tense as we waited for the nurse to call her name . I stole a quick glance at my 14-year-old daughter . She was the same gregarious child who had left to visit my mother in Arkansas at the beginning of the summer . I forced my eyes to follow the contours of her body , and they rested on the bulge of her pregnant womb just visible beneath her oversize sweatshirt . Why has this happened to us ? Why my baby ? I took a deep breath and let it out slowly . I had cried on the plane most of the way down from my home in Los Angeles to Arkansas , where Tammy had been staying with my mother for the past six months . She 'd spent the summer there and then begged to enroll in school in the fall . I knew I 'd miss her , but I 'd given my permission anyway . Los Angeles , with its fast cars and faster teens , had been too much for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways for a 14-year-old girl whose single mother worked the kind of hours I worked to get into trouble . Arkansas had seemed a good choice  --  until now . My mother had called me yesterday with the news . Tammy 's track coach had told her that Tammy " looked like something was wrong , " and a pregnancy test revealed the terrible truth . It was too late for an abortion . Yes , my mother knew who the baby 's father was  --  a boy from school who was two years older than Tammy . No , she did n't know where or when they had had sex . " How could you have let this happen ? " I had screamed at my mother over the phone . " How could you have been so careless with my daughter 's life ? " My mother had said nothing , and I 'd hung up in a rage . I called a gynecologist in the town where my mother lived and booked the first plane out of L.A. the next day . Tammy and I took a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tammy Noles , " the nurse said as she entered the room . " Would you follow me , please ? Ms. Noles , you can wait in the room at the right . " Obediently I rose from my chair and followed her to the doctor 's office to wait for him to return . The office was small and close , and I felt sweat forming on my upper lip . I looked around the room  --  at diplomas , a calendar and dozens of photographs of babies he had delivered . The photographs of his own children  --  blond , blue-eyed , laughing  --  were carefully arranged on his desk . Their fresh , smiling faces seemed a rebuke . Tammy 's life was supposed to be like theirs , carefree and concerned with childish things . I had tried hard to make it so . Where had I gone wrong ? " Ms. Noles , " the doctor said softly when he entered the room . His face was troubled as he took his seat behind his desk . I held my breath . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seven and a half months  --  she ca n't be ! " I gasped . " She says she has n't felt the baby move , she says ... " He looked down at the chart and then back at me , and his eyes were sad but sympathetic . " She 's at least seven and a half months pregnant , " he repeated softly . " Teenage mothers often deny that they feel their babies move ; it 's part of their general denial of their pregnancies . But the baby is alive , I can assure you . The heartbeat is strong . " I looked away , numb and ashamed . " Abortion is out of the question , " he said gently , as if reading my thoughts . " Things seem fine , but there 's no way of telling , because this is her first prenatal visit . I 'd like to see her every week until her delivery . " I started to cry . " What am I going to do ? " I said more to myself than to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head ; he had no answers . " If it were my daughter , I 'd want her to put the baby up for adoption , " he said . " But whatever your decision is , make it soon ; the baby will be here in less than two months . " Two months . It seemed impossible , but at 34 years old I would be a grandmother . I was numb as I left the conference room and numb as I sat in the waiting room waiting for Tammy to join me . " Hi , Mom , " Tammy said as casually as if she had just come home from a track meet . " What did the doctor say , Mom ? I mean , I knew I 'd had a few dizzy spells when I ran track at school , but honestly I did n't think I was pregnant . How could I be pregnant , Mom ? I was n't fat and my periods came back periodically ... and ... it only happened once . " Words spilled from her mouth rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd tried to hide streamed down my face . In her own 14-year-old way , Tammy understood that things were different now . But she could n't understand just how different things were . " Do n't worry , Mom . I 'm not going to keep this baby , " she vowed . " No way . I 'm not ready . I 'll put it up for adoption . " nodded . " Okay , " I said , too weak to argue . We returned to my mother 's home . I felt too exhausted even to think , yet there were questions I knew I had to answer : What should we do now ? Should I leave Tammy here and return to L.A. ? Was adoption really an option ? Yes , I decided that adoption was the best choice . But when I mentioned the possibility of adoption to my mother , she was furious . " If you do n't have the good sense to know that your own flesh and blood belongs with this family , then I 'll raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words made me further doubt the wisdom of adoption : " The chances of adoption are very slim for a Black baby , but we 'll try to place your grandchild in a nice Christian home , " she 'd said . The social worker 's words haunted me , and I wondered how long an adoption would take  --  two months , two years , ten years ? Would my grandchild languish forever in foster care ? Would he or she have foster parents who abused or neglected him or her ? Would I spend the rest of my life wondering what had become of my grandchild ? I finally realized that adoption was not an acceptable option for me . I had two months to prepare myself . I left Tammy in Arkansas with my mother and returned to L.A. I had to be certain that my insurance would cover her medical expenses and that I could take time off from work if I needed to . The two months passed quickly ; I was numb the entire time . Tammy was angry , confused and bored ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into labor on April 13 , 1988 , and I returned to Arkansas to be with my daughter . She was in labor for five hours . I felt helpless and frightened . She was a child giving birth to a child  --  that thought would not leave me . My emotions were in turmoil the day my grandson was born . One moment I grinned with joy and pride ; my own flesh and blood  --  my grandson  --  lay in the nursery , all red-brown and glowing . This is my grandchild ! I wanted to scream to the world . See how beautiful he is ! But then I would remember Tammy  --  a child herself  --  and I would feel ashamed . I would think of the financial burdens that would confront me , and my stomach would tighten with anxiety . How would I pay for all the things this new little person would need  --  the crib , car seat , diapers , clothes , toys ? In the ladies ' room , I gazed into a mirror . There were no physical changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden wisdom . Just me , a 34-year-old woman who was n't ready to catch this curveball life had thrown her . On my thirty-fourth birthday , I 'd declared to myself that this was my year to grow  --  my year to become the woman I 'd always planned to be . I 'd had so much going for me , and now this had happened . Mingled with my pride and anxiety was anger , pure and naked . But there was also joy when I looked at my grandson , Andrew . As he lay peacefully in the nursery , I whispered a silent vow to him and to myself : We will survive . I will not let us go under . The three of us returned to California , and my life became a whirlwind of activity and denial : I found a larger apartment in a nearby town . I enrolled Tammy in a new high school . I avoided people I knew ; I told strangers Andrew was my child . I hid his baby seat when I parked the car . Most days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I started missing work . Tammy and I became more and more estranged , but I was determined that the three of us would survive in the style to which we had become accustomed . My daughter would return to school and not give up anything . She would resume the normal life of a normal California teenage girl . All of life 's choices would still be hers . She would live my dreams . But life had other lessons in store for us . In the months following our return , Tammy and I had little to say to each other . Most of our conversation concerned Andrew  --  his well-being , his schedule , his life . In my commitment to my grandchild , I had forgotten that Tammy , too , was still a child . I was only one tired woman , with only so much love and energy to give . But a frantic phone call from one of Tammy 's counselors one morning at my job made me know that I would have to find strength from somewhere . " Are you aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended two classes in two weeks ? " she asked me . Her voice was sharp and held me accountable . I told the counselor that I would talk to Tammy and promised that she would be in school the next day . When I slammed the door of my apartment that night , Tammy saw for the first time the pent-up rage of months . I screamed and yelled , all my anger and disappointment finally unleashed . Tammy stared at me blankly and then promised to do better . But the worst was yet to come . Day by day Tammy seemed to grow less attentive to Andrew 's needs . She did n't seem to care whether he was dressed properly or if he 'd been fed . She could n't understand why I needed to spend more money on Andrew than on her . As an only child , she had never had to share , and she began to see Andrew more as a sibling than as her child . She was angry at me , she was angry at Andrew , and  --  in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the world . Her anger played itself out in her relationship with her son , with me and with school . I had to begin to face painful truths , and once again this was a new feeling for me . There had been nothing in my own life to prepare me for what had happened to Tammy . When I was growing up in a small Arkansas town in the sixties and seventies , girls got pregnant , but they were older  --  17 or 18 . I myself had been 19 and single when I 'd had Tammy . But at 15 you were still playing with dolls , still a virgin . Things were so different now . As time went by , things seemed more settled , more peaceful between us . But Tammy was quietly simmering to a boiling point . She began to secretly defy me at every opportunity , and her anger showed itself in cruel , childish ways . By his first birthday , Andrew was beginning to walk . Tammy , however , seemed to be getting younger ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to neglect Andrew . One day while Tammy was curling her hair , Andrew somehow got hold of the curling iron and was burned . I rushed him to the emergency room with two huge burns on his leg . " This kind of thing happens frequently with teenage mothers , " the doctor warned me . " But do n't let it happen again . " His voice was chastising and seemed to imply that there could be grounds for child-abuse charges if he saw Andrew in such a condition again . Tammy seemed resentful and unconcerned . I wondered if she could abuse Andrew without realizing she was doing it . I hesitated now to leave Andrew with her , wondering what would happen . It seemed the more I bonded with my grandson , the more alienated Tammy became . Had I gained a grandchild and lost my child ? One night I looked into the bedroom Tammy and Andrew shared . Andrew was sleeping snugly , but the window was open and Tammy was gone . I searched the neighborhood . Panicked , I called the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , casually talking and joking with a man in his mid-twenties . The next morning Tammy and I avoided each other 's eyes and went our separate ways . But the following week , the man showed up at our apartment . I told him that at 15 Tammy was simply too young to have dealings with him and that I had forbidden her to see him again . " What are you trying to protect her from ? She already has a baby , " he smirked . I recoiled , wounded and insulted . " So you see my daughter as damaged goods ? " I snapped back . He ignored me and made it clear that he would see Tammy whenever he wished and that there was nothing I could do to stop him . I slammed the door in his face . Tammy was furious with me . My anger now turned toward her , but a sense of sadness and loss overwhelmed me . I was unable to protect my child . I was a failure as a mother . Where had I gone wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always been a strict disciplinarian  --  my parents had been strict with me . Had I been too strict ? I was haunted by the fear that the fact that I 'd been an unmarried teenage mother had somehow affected Tammy . Tammy was and always had been my heart . Was she paying for my sins ? Had the life choices I made when I was a girl somehow affected her ? Shame and guilt hung over me like a cloud , and I could barely function at work the next day . I began to question everything about myself and my life . But Tammy had begun to ask some questions of her own . When I came home from work that night , she had an announcement : " I want to leave , " she said quietly . " Can I go and live with Grandma in Arkansas ? " I sat down with her to listen to what she had to say ; and for the first time in a long time , our conversation was calm . I think we had both reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to change . " I could go to college down there , Mom . As soon as I finish school , I could send for Andrew , get a job and support him on my own . But I just ca n't handle this anymore . " " Okay , " I said finally . I knew I could n't handle it anymore , either . Perhaps there was no other way . I picked up the phone , called my mother and then made travel arrangements . The next day , Andrew and I said goodbye to Tammy at the train station . As the train pulled away , I breathed a sigh of relief . I smiled at Andrew , and he smiled back ; he had Tammy 's smile . That night Andrew and I played on the floor before I put him to bed . It was the first restful night I 'd had in months . I knew we could make it . Tammy is 19 now and adjusting well in Arkansas . Her grades are excellent , and she plans to work her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , to heal , to learn to love each other again . We are closer than we 've ever been . Andrew is 4 and as smart as a whip . He 's in day care and needs me less than he did when he was an infant . And what about me ? What have I learned from all this ? I now know how strong I am and that I can survive any crisis . I 've also learned the importance of controlling anger in circumstances that are beyond my control and that children in crisis need unconditional love and understanding . If you and your teenage daughter find yourselves in circumstances like mine and Tammy 's , it 's important to develop a plan of action . Try to have a firm sense of practical matters , such as day-care costs and how medical expenses will be paid . It 's also helpful to consult an attorney to determine if you need to become the baby 's legal guardian so that he or she will be covered by your health insurance . You may also find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As African-Americans , we must begin to confront teenage pregnancy . It happened to me , it 's happening to the daughters of my friends , and it will happen to countless other Black girls in the future . If there 's one thing we have going for us , it 's our future  --  our children  --  and we must protect it with all of the strength , wisdom and courage we can summon .
