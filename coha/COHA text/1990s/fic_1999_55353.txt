We were almost out of money , so Trace went to steal us another bottle of something . We were celebrating . The holiday weekend was almost over , and the mechanic was due back in town the next morning . We 'd finally be able to get back on the road . <p> I sat on the rear bumper of the van and waited . Smoke from the fireworks still hung in the air . Biggest display in the Mojave , the posters had promised . Maybe it was , but we could n't tell . An hour before the show , the sky had curdled into a clump of fog . Fog , in the desert . First time in twenty years , someone said . <p> I watched the smoke and fog mingle and roll in lazy waves in and out of the orange floodlight of the gas station . All around me were junked cars parked at crazy angles , cracked windshields and fallen bumpers shining in the greasy light . Buicks and Chevys and Pontiacs , all chrome and disappointment . The dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted like gunpowder . We were still thousands of miles from Alaska . <p> Trace was gone a long time , too long , and I wondered if he 'd found a girl and gone off with her . It happened a lot . He 'd picked up a girl at the bar the night we broke down . She was wispy and tan and blond , so good-looking that her red eyes and thick liquor-stink just made her seem game and fearless instead of sad . She said she was from San Diego , on her way east to divinity school . At last call , I saw her lift her skirt and flash Trace her tiger-print panties , and they spent the night in her motel room . I slept in the van . " I do n't understand it , " he said the next day . " I 'm a fucked-up  --  looking guy , but I always get the beautiful ones . " It was true . He was fucked-up-looking-short and puffy , with a half-closed eye and a nose that looked like it 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did always get the beautiful ones , and he always seemed genuinely surprised by it . You could tell him to shut up and enjoy his luck , but that never stopped him from wondering out loud . <p> While I waited for Trace , I ran through the names of the places we 'd drive through next : Tehachapi , Bakersfield , Fresno , Modesto , Lodi , Red Bluff , Redding . I 'd studied the map , knew the route by heart . I wanted to see all these towns in the rearview , feel them as beats in a rhythm of places passed by , a rhythm as steady and soothing as tires thrumming over pavement joints . <p> When Trace came back to the van , he was carrying a baby wrapped in a threadbare beach towel . " Hey , Phil , " he said . " Look what I got . " He held it up like it was a carnival prize . The baby 's eyes were shut , but it wrinkled its little fingers open and closed so I knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Someone gave it to me . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " A woman . Outside the liquor store . " <p> " People do n't just hand out babies , " I said . <p> " This one did , " he said . <p> " Take it back . " <p> " I ca n't , " he said . " She drove away . " <p> " We have to find her , " I said . " People will think we stole it . " <p> Trace carried the baby as we walked along the road into town . He hummed softly and rocked it in his arms . I kicked at the loose gravel . " The mother , " I said , " was she fat ? " The other morning , in the taco place , I 'd seen a fat woman chew up a quesadilla and dribble it into her baby 's mouth . Like she thought they were penguins or something . It was all I could do to keep my food down , watching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't want any baby , but I especially did n't want that one . <p> " No , " Trace said . " She was skinny . " <p> " Even so , " I said . " We have to get rid of it . " <p> In the streetlight I could see the baby 's eyes were open and coffee-brown . Its forehead and nose were bright red . The mother , whoever the hell she was , had let the kid get sunburned . Even I knew you 're not supposed to do that . Still , the baby looked pretty happy . It was n't crying . As babies go , this one was well-behaved . <p> We sat on the curb in the liquor store parking lot and waited for the mother to come back . The baby slept in Trace 's arms . People walked by and looked at us suspiciously . No one recognized the baby . After a while the store owner banged on the glass and waved us away . I pointed to the baby , trying to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving . <p> " I knew she would n't come back , " Trace said . <p> " We should call the cops , " I said . <p> " No , " Trace said . " No cops . " <p> He was right . Technically , we were fugitives . <p> " Let 's go to the bar , " he said . " I could use a drink . " <p> I did n't have any better ideas . That 's always been a problem for me . <p> We started walking again . " I wonder what its name is , " Trace said . <p> " Is it a boy or a girl ? " <p> " Either way , I 'm going to call it Mo . " Mo was his ex 's name , short for Maureen . He loved her , but she was back in New York , shacked up with a guy who made millions riding the bench for the Yankees . <p> I knew what he was thinking . He was thinking that he could save this baby , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keeping it , " I said . <p> " We could . " <p> " We 're giving it back . " I was waiting for him to say something drunk like This baby needs us . This baby did n't need us . We were the last thing it needed . It needed anyone but us . <p> That whole year we 'd been riding a crest of failure . In March , my girlfriend left me after I threw her shoes out the window , and then Mo and Trace broke up , this time for good . It had been Trace 's idea to leave New York for Colorado . " We 'll be river rafting guides , " he 'd said . " You get to help girls into their wetsuits . " We got there , and the rivers were nearly dry . No snow that winter . So we bought the van and tried to start a painting business , but we never found a customer . It was easy to leave when the court dates started piling up . Alaska was his idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was stuck . Stuck in a town that was n't more than a crosshair of blacktop trained on the desert . <p> The bar was dark and narrow . Dim red light , like a darkroom . Red vinyl stools and booths . Two pool tables . A jukebox that played songs about trucks . I sat in a booth and told Trace to show the baby to the bartender . He held out his free hand for money . " Drinks , " he said . I took off my sneaker and gave him the ten I 'd been keeping for an emergency . It was the last of the money for now , because Trace 's sister would only wire us a little at a time . " I have my own kids to feed , " she 'd say . But usually she came through , wiring it in my name because she did n't trust him and because she liked me from when I was a kid . Trace and I had grown up together , watched our parents ' marriages bust up at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad was sleeping with his mom . Got closer , maybe . <p> The baby started to cry . Trace held up the bill and sniffed it . " For fuck 's sake , Phil , " he said . " The money stinks . You got trench foot or something . " <p> What did he expect ? I 'd been walking around in a desert for four days without any socks . We 'd had to pack in a hurry . <p> My head hurt . I leaned against the wall and stretched my legs out on the seat and tried to pretend I was somewhere else . <p> Earlier that night , Trace and I had gone to the fireworks show , which was held on a football field that looked like it had n't been used in years . No goal posts , no scoreboard , just a rectangle of sandy dirt and rocks with scabs of turf . Lots of families sat on blankets out on the field . High school kids sat in the bleachers , and every now and then you 'd hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal steps . We sat up on a little hill with some people from the bar . Trace had shot pool with some of them , and they liked us because he 'd told them we were outlaws . They called us Butch and Sundance . <p> We drank and waited . Finally Trace said loudly , " When the hell is this going to start ? " <p> A short , bald guy named Roy passed him a bottle of bourbon . " You got somewhere to go , Butch ? " Roy said . Everyone laughed . They knew we were stuck . " They 're waiting for the fog to blow through , " Roy went on . <p> " It 's not blowing through , " I said . There was only the faintest breeze . <p> " It 'll clear up , " Roy said . " We 're not supposed to have fog . We 're not even supposed to have clouds this time of year . " We 'd met Roy our first night in town . He walked with a limp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that Roy had never been farther than Barstow , that he limped because he took some shrapnel in his legs when the transmission in his VW exploded . So you did n't know whether to believe this guy when he talked about clouds . <p> " They should just cancel it , " I said . " What 's the point ? " <p> Roy said , " Son , you do n't cancel the Fourth of July . This is America . " <p> Then the show started with a loud crushing thud that I could feel in my stomach and throat . There was the faintest glow of green from inside the clouds . People whistled and clapped , but I could n't see why . More fireworks went up . Some were like thunderclaps and war-movie cannons , some were smaller , sharper , like cracks of the bat , a roll on a snare drum , popcorn popping . But it was just noise . Noise , and muted flashes of light just bright enough to remind you of how much you were missing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Trace drank a long swallow . " We could steal a car , " he said . He sat up straight . " I ca n't believe I did n't think of that sooner . " <p> " We do n't need that kind of trouble , " I said . Although looking back , it probably was the best thing we could have done . <p> He lit a cigarette , nodding , and looked out across the field . " We 'll be in Alaska before you know it , " he said . He passed me the bottle . " Think of all the money we 're going to make up there . " <p> " We 'll have to work hard . " <p> " We 'll save up and get our own boat , for next year , " he said . " We 'll get a boat with one of those Viking heads on the front . " <p> " Boats are expensive , " I said . <p> " I 'll find a way . I always do . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get a fixer-upper , " he said . Though neither of us was any good at fixing things . We 'd proved that often enough . <p> Boom boom boom and clouds choking all the sparkles . It was unbearable , but there was n't any point in leaving , either . <p> Around us people were talking . " They 're changing the angle . Shooting lower . " " Is that safe ? " " Hope not . " Laughs . <p> The new angle was no better . Just louder . Now and then I saw pinpoints of colored light leak out of the clouds and shine for an instant before they burned out close to the ground . By the end , the field was a big bowl of smoke . Trace and I would be blowing black snot out of our noses for days . <p> Trace came back to the booth . Somehow he 'd gotten the baby to stop crying . He handed the thing to me and went back to the bar to pick up our drinks . I 'd never held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked inside the towel , but its eyes were open , and it stared up at me calmly , like it wanted to learn what fear was by watching me . I just held tight and did n't move until Trace came back . I made him take it out of my hands . He sat down , cradled the baby in both arms , and sucked on his drink through a straw . <p> " The bartender does n't recognize it , " Trace said . " He said to wait an hour , see if anyone who comes in does . After that , he 'll call the cops . " <p> Trace held the baby up to his face and smiled . He rubbed noses with it . If Mo could have seen him like this , she 'd never have left him . But it made me nervous . <p> " Seriously , did you steal it ? " I asked . <p> " Call it by its name , " he said . " Call it Mo . " He unwrapped the beach towel . Underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeper . On the chest was a cartoon duckling in a rain hat and boots , smiling . A happy , happy duck . <p> I ran my hand across the tabletop , which was gouged deeply with years of drunken attempts to leave a mark on the world . " Think about this , " I said . " If we kept it , who would watch it while we were working ? " <p> " Mo could . Big Mo , I mean . " <p> " I do n't think Mo is going to move to Alaska , " I said . <p> " She might , " he said . The baby slapped at Trace 's glass , but missed . Trace moved the glass away . " Or Little Mo could come on the boat with us , " he said . " Little Mo 's a good luck charm . I can feel it . Fish will swarm around our boat . " <p> " Fish do n't swarm , " I said . " They school . " <p> " That 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " we have to find the mother . " <p> We were almost done with our drinks when Roy the shrapnel guy limped over with a pitcher of beer . He put it on the table . " My treat , " he said . " To make up for the fireworks . You picked the wrong year to get stuck here . " Roy had been pretty nice to us . The other night he 'd bought us a scratch-off lottery ticket , but it lost . <p> " Thanks , " I said . You could smell the fireworks smoke on him . I guess it was on all of us . <p> He knelt down in front of Trace and the baby as best he could , with his bad legs and all . The baby gurgled and waved its arms in happy little ovals . " And what have we here ? " Roy said . <p> " It 's a baby , " I said . " You know whose it is ? " <p> " No , " Roy said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on Trace and the baby . " Is it a boy or a girl ? " <p> " We do n't know , " Trace said . <p> " There 's an easy way to find out , " Roy said . <p> " You 're right , " Trace said . " We should check . " He moved his drink out of the way and laid the baby on the table . <p> " Do n't , " I said . " Not in the middle of the goddamned bar . " <p> " What 's the difference ? " Roy said . <p> " It 's no big deal , " Trace said . " We ought to know . " <p> " It 's not right , " I said . I thought the kid deserved better . " Do n't do it , Trace , " I said , in the voice I used when he took things too far . <p> Trace picked the baby up . He knew I only challenged him when I meant it . <p> Someone called Roy 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks just like you , " Roy said to Trace . With his thumb and index finger , he tickled the baby 's chin . Then he tickled Trace 's , which was thick with stubble . " Tell Sundance to lighten up . " He shot me a look and walked over to the pool table . <p> " He 's hitting on you , " I said . <p> Trace shrugged . " I know , " he said . " We need drinks , though . " He smiled a smile that said he was in control , he 'd take care of everything , he 'd save the day all by himself . <p> Still , I knew it bothered him . It bothered him that Mo was probably in bed with her utility infielder , happy and horny after a Yankee win and postgame fireworks in a starry sky over the stadium , while Trace was dead-broke and stuck in the desert with Roy chucking his chin . So I was n't surprised when , once the beer was gone , Trace went quiet and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started looking around the place like he could n't believe his life had come to this . And I was n't surprised at all when he put the baby on the table and went to the phone to call her . <p> The baby waved its arms up and down like a drunk piano player , tiny fingers pattering on the table . I kept my hand on its legs so it would n't roll over and fall . My father once told me that when I was little , I 'd fallen off a picnic table and hit my head on the cement patio . " Your mother was supposed to be watching you , " he said . " It 's her fault you 're a fuck-up . " He said this the day before Trace and I saw him necking with a teenage girl in the parking lot behind the bank . <p> The jukebox was too loud for me to hear what Trace was saying , but in the space between records I thought I heard him say something embarrassing like We can be a family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver against the phone , which answered with cheerful pings . People looked over , then looked away . " At least do it on the beat , " the bartender shouted , like he 'd seen it a hundred times . Trace wound up and gave the receiver one more whack , then threw it down and left it to twist and swing . He came back to the table . I assumed she 'd hung up on him , so I did n't ask . <p> " She would n't listen to me , " he said . His face looked red , but it might have been the lights . <p> " Was the Yankee there ? " <p> " Pinch-hitting sonofabitch . " <p> " He 's no star , " I agreed . <p> " She did n't believe me about the baby , " Trace said . <p> " You could have held it up to the phone . " <p> " This baby 's pretty quiet , " he said . <p> " You 're right , " I said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trace picked up the baby , cradled it . He seemed to relax . " You have to support its head , see , " he said to me . " It does n't have neck muscles yet . " <p> We needed more to drink , so Trace left to find Roy . I made him take the baby with him , to show it around . Right after he got up , a woman sitting at the bar turned on her stool and looked at me . I 'd seen her in the bar before , and she 'd been on the hill at the fireworks show , but I had n't talked to her . She was forty , forty-five , thin , a redhead halfway to gray . She wore jeans and a faded black shirt with the top two or three buttons open and the sleeves rolled up . She walked over , pulled up a chair to the end of the booth , and sat down . <p> " I hear your name is Sundance , " she said . <p> " It 's Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name , and I did n't ask . " I hear you 're running from the law , " she said . She had a long , thin nose that twitched when she talked . <p> " Not really , " I said . " I do n't think they 're chasing us . We just have bench warrants . In Colorado . " <p> She asked what we had done , so I told her . I told her about Trace 's DUIs and Resisting Arrests and how he missed a court date because we were up all night drinking with two girls from the community college who , it turned out , were both hot for him . And about how I bashed the bail bondsman 's guy with a two-by-four when he broke into our apartment a few days later . I did n't know they were allowed to break in . No one teaches you something like that until it 's too late . <p> Trace came back to the table , balancing the baby and a full pitcher . A thin trail of beer wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? " the woman asked . She touched its nose , said something like Wugga-wugga-woo , and the baby made a noise that might have been a cough or a laugh . <p> " It 's mine , " Trace said . He sounded almost like he believed it . <p> " Four months ? " she guessed . <p> " Three , " he said , not missing a beat . " Little Mo 's developing faster than most . " <p> " Where 's the mother ? " she asked . <p> " New York . " <p> " That 's far away , " she said . <p> " The mother , " he said , " is a cold-hearted lying drooling bitch . " Trace looked pretty drunk . I figured if he was , I must be , too . <p> " Some men think we all are , " she said . I could tell she did n't like him at all . She looked at the baby like she felt sorry for it . <p> " I do n't think he means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . " <p> " I do n't mean that about you , " Trace said . " I do n't know you . " <p> She turned to me . " How about you ? Is there a woman in your life ? " I watched her nose winking at me . <p> " There was , " I said . " It did n't work out . " I had been with her a year , and then one night , no warning , she told me it was over . You want me to be just like Mo , she 'd said . Well , I 'm not Mo . It 's not fair , and I 'm sick of it . She may have been right . It 's just that Mo was a lot more likable . I told her so , and she threw her shoes at me , and I threw them out the window . One got stuck in a tree . It was still there when Trace and I left town . <p> The woman leaned back in her chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past her shoulders . " How old are you ? " she asked . " Twenty-seven ? Twenty-eight ? " <p> " Twenty-three , " I said . It occurred to me that my life was bleeding out of me even faster than I 'd thought . <p> " I have a kid , " the woman said . " He 's eighteen . " She sipped her drink . " He went to jail this week . " <p> " What for ? " I asked . <p> " Joyride . Took a car from the lot at the gas station . " <p> " That 's all ? " I said . <p> " That bastard Chavez pressed charges . " <p> " That bastard Chavez has our van , " Trace said . <p> " We broke down , " I explained . " We 're waiting for him to fix it . " <p> " He 's a bastard , " she said . <p> It would turn out that she was right . Chavez was a bastard . The next morning he would tell me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred to replace it . We 'd say we could n't pay that much , so he 'd offer us a trade : the van straight up for a ' 79 Bonneville with no muffler and bad brakes and power windows that would n't go down . We 'd take it . We 'd need to get out of town in a hurry . <p> Behind me I heard a pool ball smack on the floor and roll away . The baby started to cry , but Trace jiggled it , and it stopped . Spit bubbled from its mouth . The woman finished her drink . I watched her neck as she swallowed . The skin around it looked a little loose , baggy . I 'd never noticed that on anyone before . <p> " He did n't even steal anything good , " she said . " Just an old VW , all rusted to shit . You 'd think the boy would have some taste , at least . " <p> " He 's lucky to be alive , " Trace said . " The transmission could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " The judge said I was a bad mother , " she said . <p> " That 's terrible , " I said . " What 'd he have to say that for ? " But he could have been right , for all I knew . <p> She set her glass down on the table , hard . " I 'm a good mother , " she said . " A damn good mother . " Her eyes got wet . It was like she 'd been waiting a long time to say this , waiting to find someone who might believe her . <p> " I 'm sure you are , " I said . <p> " I have to take a leak , " Trace said . " Can you hold my baby ? " He held it out to her . <p> She sat the baby in her lap and bounced it up and down . " Hello , baby , " she said . " What a big baby you are . What a bouncing baby . " She kissed it on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe she was a good mother . The baby looked like it was in heaven , eyes half-closed and dreamy . It drooled a little more , and she wiped its mouth with a cocktail napkin . Her eyes were still wet , but she 'd started to smile . She was pretty when she smiled . I told her so . <p> " You should stop hanging around with that guy , " she said . " I can tell he 's holding you back . " <p> I told her I knew that . It was what she wanted to hear . <p> The baby grabbed her nose , and she wiggled her head from side to side . " That 's a nose you 've got there , " she said . " That 's my nose . " The baby let go , but kept moving its hand through the air like it still had a nose in it . <p> " When are you leaving town ? " she asked me . <p> " Tomorrow , " I said , " I hope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the van , " I said . <p> Her knee touched mine . " Want to stay with me tonight ? " she asked . She saw me look at her ring . " I have money for a room , " she said . <p> I did n't even consider saying no . I swept the baby out of her arms , without thinking , without worrying , like I 'd held a baby every day of my life , like I juggled babies in my spare time . That 's when the smell hit me . The kid was ripe . She smelled it , too . <p> " Jackpot , " she said . <p> I found Trace standing with Roy at the pool table , a fresh drink in his hand . I handed him the baby . <p> " Phil , this baby stinks , " Trace said . <p> " You 're going to have to change it , " I said . " Maybe feed it , too . You got us into this . " <p> He nodded , slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " For fuck 's sake , Trace , " I said , " why 'd you take this thing ? You could 've said no . " <p> He steadied himself against the pool table . " I was called , " he said with a stupid smile . " I was called by forces we ca n't understand . " " Tell the bartender to call the cops , " I said . " The mother 's not coming in here . " <p> " I 'm going to give her some more time , " he said . <p> " I 'm leaving , " I said . " I have somewhere to go . " <p> " Where ? Where is there to go ? " <p> " The motel . " <p> He looked surprised . Then he smiled that same smile again . " Have fun , " he said . " I 'll be fine here . " <p> " I ca n't give you any more money , " I said . " We 're all out . " <p> Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " Do n't worry , " he said . " Drinks for the daddy are on me . " <p> " Yeah , do n't worry , " Trace said , smooth and cool . " Roy 's buying . " <p> I went back to the booth . She sucked the last ice cubes out of her glass , then whispered to me , lips cold and wet , that she would leave first and I should wait a minute before following . " It 's a small town , " she said . I doubt we fooled anyone . People turned to watch me as I walked out . She was waiting in the motel parking lot , money in her hand . She told me to get the room while she waited outside . <p> The lobby of the Astro-Budget Motel stank of curry . The desk clerk kept looking out the window like he expected something to come crashing through it . " What 's wrong ? " I asked him . <p> " There 's a party going on , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It usually is . " He gave me a room on the other side of the motel . I took the key and wished him luck . <p> She had her tongue in my ear before we got to the top of the cement stairs . We kissed outside the room , leaning on the metal railing . " Look at that view , " she said , extending her arm like she was showing me a whole new world . <p> The fog had blown away , but all I could see was the motel parking lot , some scattered lights , dark desert . " There 's nothing to see , " I said . <p> " That 's what I mean , " she said , and she kissed me again . <p> I had to push her away to unlock the door . The room was decorated in sad shades of brown . Brown carpet and curtains , brown and orange plaid bedspread , two brown-cushioned chairs , a still life of a coconut on tan fabric . <p> The room was choking hot , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweetie , " she said , and I kissed her long and hard because I could n't remember the last time anyone called me sweetie .

" Five days , " I said . <p> " Why do n't you clean yourself up , " she said gently . " I 'll go get us a bottle . " <p> In the shower it seemed like I could smell everything that was coming off me , layer by layer , a grimy scrapbook of our time on the road . Smoke from fireworks , cigarettes , and dope . Sweat from the heat and pushing the van and the booze and a dozen straight losing hands in Vegas . Road dust . And Jesus , my feet . I smelled like I was dying . <p> I got out of the shower without drying . I switched off the lights in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of it , naked , my eyes closed . At first it wheezed out warm air , but it gradually turned colder , just like I imagined the outside air would as we drove farther and farther north . I imagined me and Trace in Alaska , hauling in huge catches of salmon , wet and free and happy in the never-ending daylight and the cold ocean spray . And I imagined myself there in winter , when I 'd have a wallet full of money and a head full of stories , ready to endure the long dark and the cold , a cold so deep that it would freeze out everything but your purest self , and suddenly you 'd understand where things had gone so wrong . I stood there in the cold air , thinking , listening to the faint and soothing lilt of water drops on the thin carpet underneath the air conditioner 's sputter and grind , feeling the goose bumps rise on my arms , then my legs , then along my scalp , until she came up behind me and skated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fingernail .

" Let me in , " he said , and in his voice was something that told me he knew she would be gone , and that I should have known , too . I found my shorts in the bathroom and put them on . <p> I opened the door . Trace stood there , wobbling , holding the wall for support . Roy stood back against the railing , holding a case of beer and a pizza box . " Come on in , " I said , " but I 'm going to sleep . " <p> The door closed , and it was dark . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turn on the light , " I said . <p> " I ca n't see , " he said , his voice getting high and scared . " Oh fuck , I 'm blind . I ca n't see . " <p> I turned on the light next to the bed . Roy stood near the door , still holding the beer and pizza . Trace was lying on the floor on his side , his hands over his eyes , moving his legs like he was running . " I ca n't see , " he said . <p> " Jesus , what 's he on ? " I said to Roy . " What did you give him ? " <p> " The bikers said it was just crank , " Roy said . " But I do n't know . " <p> I got out of the bed and knelt next to Trace . " Hey , buddy , " I said , " it 's me . It 's Phil . It 's all right . " I pulled his hands away from his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if he was going to die , if I should call someone . <p> He stopped kicking his legs . For a few minutes he did n't say anything , did n't move , but I could see him breathing . Then he blinked and looked at me . " I got us some pizza , " he said . He said it like he wanted me to say yes , yes , you sure did , you 're a hero . <p> Roy sat on the edge of the bed and opened a bottle of beer . Trace pointed at him . " That guy wants to fuck me , " he said . " He wants to fuck me in the butt . " <p> I looked at Roy . He sipped his beer and shrugged . " Well , I do , " he said . " It 's no secret . I told him hours ago . " <p> " Get out of here , " I said . <p> " Cool it , Sundance , " he said . " I paid for this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Trace crawled over to the pizza box and took out a slice . " Have some pizza , Phil , " he said , like he had it all under control . So I went and put on the rest of my clothes , took a slice , and opened beers for the two of us . <p> Trace and I sat at the table next to the window , and Roy sat on the bed . We ate and drank . Roy tried a few times to make conversation , but I did n't feel much like talking , and Trace did n't seem like he could . Roy gave up , leaned back , and watched us , smoking a clove cigarette . No one spoke , but the room was full of sound : the air conditioner grinding away , the alarm clock humming and flipping numbers on the minute , Trace and I chewing and swallowing , Roy exhaling long streams of smoke . We heard bursts of life from the biker party outside  --  running footsteps , laughing , a bottle smashed , a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman cursing each other . A Harley thundered alive and revved senselessly . <p> " They 're from Bakersfield , most of them , " Roy said . " They come through here a lot . Best parties this town ever sees . " Then he leaned forward and said , " Bobbi 's husband is down there right now , you know . " <p> " Who 's Bobbi ? " I asked . <p> " The woman who brought you here , " he said . " That girl gets around . So does her husband . I hope you used a condom . " Of course I had n't . I felt sick . I felt like I 'd been in that town forever . <p> " Me , I never use them , " Roy said . " I like to feel everything . " Then rambled on and on about everything he liked to feel , and everything he wanted to do with Trace , and everything was my cock this and my cock that , and Trace just sat and ate and drank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . Finally I got sick of it . I told Roy to shut the hell up and leave . " Look who 's Mister Manly all of a sudden , " he said . " I bet I could make you cry . " He unbuckled his belt . " I could make you call for God . " <p> That 's when Trace threw a bottle at him . It shattered on the wall . Roy got wet from the spray . <p> " Settle down , Butch , " Roy said . " I 'm just kidding . " <p> Trace took another bottle out of the case and threw that one , too . It barely missed Roy 's head . " Leave Phil alone , " Trace said . <p> Roy 's mouth inched open , and he stared at Trace . " It was a joke , " he said . He sounded scared , but he did n't move . <p> " Trace , " I said . " Come on . Calm down . " But Trace wound up and threw another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It made a dull , hollow sound . Roy cried out and jumped off the bed , limped toward the door . Trace kept throwing , and even as I was telling him to stop I found myself picking up a bottle and letting fly . <p> Roy fell once . <p> By the time he got the door open , there was blood on his face , but I do n't know if we hit him straight on or if he got cut by a ricochet . For some reason he stopped in the doorway to yell at us . " You guys are insane , " he shouted , his hands in fists . " You guys are sick . " I picked up the pint bottle that Bobbi had bought , and I threw it . Roy ducked , and it sailed over the railing . I heard it shatter in the parking lot below . Then Roy was gone , his uneven steps pounding down the stairs , his undone buckle jangling . <p> We 'd wrecked the room . The carpet soaked . The bedside light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mirror hit dead-on , angry cracks snaking out from the point of impact . Blooms of beer seeping into the walls , into the fabric of the coconut print . I stripped the sheets and blankets off the bed , and Trace crawled onto the bare mattress , the only thing in the room not covered with glass . <p> " We should get out of here , " I said . <p> " I 'm going to sleep , " he said . " I 'm sleepy . " <p> It was only then that I remembered the baby . I asked him if the cops had taken it . <p> " Oh , the baby , " he said slowly , like he was remembering the night one frame at a time . " The baby . " <p> " Where is it ? Did you bring it to the party ? " <p> " I gave it to someone , " he said . He closed his eyes . " Mo would want to have her own . " <p> Then he fell asleep . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart might be giving out . <p> I know I should have tried to find the baby . I may even have wanted to . But outside was a dark town with too many people I could n't face alone . Inside was Trace , who needed me to make sure he kept breathing . I shook the glass off a chair and sat , watching him , trying not to think about the baby , trying not to think about myself . I watched for cops , but they never came . Neither did any friends of Roy 's . No angry husband , no fucked-up bikers . No one . In a way , that made it worse . <p> Trace woke up just after sunrise , and we headed for the gas station , staying off the road . We waited inside the van for that bastard of a mechanic to show up . <p> We made it to Alaska , but we never got out on a fishing boat . Instead we had to work at the processing plant , keeping the drains clear underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish guts . I only lasted a month . I caught pneumonia and had to go home to live with my father and his new wife while I recovered . At the end of the summer , Trace moved to San Francisco with some girl he 'd met up there after I 'd left . A year later , he would be dead . He hit bottom , and Mo  --  who 'd married the Yankee  --  offered to fly him back to New York and pay for rehab . He hanged himself in the basement at O'Hare during the layover . <p> Who knew airports even had basements ? <p> One night when we were in Anchorage , Trace won a storytelling contest at a bar . Five hundred dollar prize . He told the story of his first kiss  --  a story I 'd heard the day after it happened . How he was eleven and she was sixteen , how this older girl had punched her tongue into his mouth and held it there , puffed up like an insult , not moving . How she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her braces : tuna salad , peanut butter crackers , banana . It was n't so much the story as the way he told it , smiling and flapping his arms and dancing and shining with self-deprecation , offering every word like it was his last cigarette and he was glad to let you have it . He blew the five hundred in an hour , buying drinks for all of us in the house . Trace could be a hero . You just had to be watching at the right time . <p> Like the day we destroyed the house he grew up in with sledgehammers . His sister and her husband had bought the house from Trace 's mom and wanted to redo the interior , so they hired the two of us to gut the place . I had to stop and rest , but Trace was like a machine , swinging the hammer harder and harder , grunting with every stroke , grunts that echoed louder as one by one the walls fell into rubble . I held the ladder for him as he broke apart the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years at least , a whole family  --  mother , father , sister , and Trace  --  had hung their Christmas stockings . I watched him as the chunks of brick and mortar flew under each stroke , and before long I picked up my hammer again , believing that this was the most honest work either of us would ever do . <p> <p> By Doug Dorst <p>
